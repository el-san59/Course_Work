Although this approach reflects the concepts currently underlying the delivery of occupational health services in Canada and in other countries, it is sometimes necessary to consider the problems that relate specifically to occupational medicine and to those who practise in this field. In this article some of these problems are discussed and suggestions made as to the way in which occupational medical practice may develop in Canada.\r"

Childhood milk consumption, current dietary calcium intake, level of avocational physical activity and lifestyle variables such as cigarette smoking and coffee consumption, considered separately, did not reach statistically significant levels as determinants of bone density. Childhood physical activity level appeared to have a significant positive effect on bone density.\r"

The need for rurally based genetic services prompted the inclusion of an outreached program in the Alberta Hereditary Diseases Program (AHDP), which was established in 1979; the AHDP was designed to provide services to the entire province through two regional centres and seven outreach clinics. There is a community health nurse in almost every health unit whose duties are either totally or partially devoted to the AHDP; thus, genetic help and information are as close as a rural health unit. The AHDP is designed to provide complete clinical (diagnostic, counselling and some management) services and laboratory (cytogenetic, biochemical and molecular) services for genetic disorders. In addition, the program emphasizes education and publishes a quarterly bulletin, which is sent free of charge to all physicians, hospitals, public health units, social service units, major radio and television stations, newspapers and public libraries and to selected individuals and groups in Alberta.\r"

In 1988 the Sub-Committee on Research of the Standing Committee on CME [continuing medical education], Association of Canadian Medical Colleges, conducted a survey to determine whether those responsible for the CME portion of the medical school curriculum are changing their perceptions to keep pace with the changes in health care. The results were compared with those of a similar survey done in 1983. In both surveys people directly responsible for delivery of formal CME were asked to identify and rank research needs in CME. The response rates were very high. The CME issues identified in the two surveys had changed considerably, with entirely new issues being identified in 1988 and the emphasis placed on issues having changed. The identification of factors that promote or inhibit application of new knowledge by practising physicians was of lowest importance in 1983 and of primary importance in 1988, and comparison of the cost-effectiveness of CME methods was an important issue in 1983 and among the least important in 1988. The noted changes mirror developments in Canada's health care milieu.\r"

There were no significant differences in the frequency of detection of HPV DNA between the two groups. In a cross-sectional survey the prevalence of HPV DNA was found to be 11% in specimens without CIN, 27% in those with CIN I, 49% in those with CIN II and 56% in those with CIN III. The positivity rates for HPV 16/33 DNA increased with the severity of CIN, but this was not observed for HPV 6/11 and 18 DNA. A comparison of the results of the case-control and cross-sectional studies suggested that the younger cohort of women had higher prevalence rates of HPV DNA than the older cohort.\r"

The direct method of age standardization was used on sex-specific and age-specific death rates, with the 1960 US population as the standard. In both countries the death rates increased then decreased, although the changes in the Canadian rates occurred later and were less pronounced than those in the US rates. Men and elderly people were at higher risk of death from pulmonary embolism than women and younger people. Prevention strategies, possibly including encouraging a more active lifestyle and targetting high-risk groups, may further reduce pulmonary embolism death rates in both countries.\r"

A total of 70% of the respondents judged that the treatment of severe hypertension was the most beneficial. Coronary artery bypass surgery and treatment with acetylsalicylic acid for transient ischemic attacks were ranked next most useful. Cholestyramine therapy for hypercholesterolemia, the treatment of mild hypertension, isoniazid therapy for inactive tuberculosis and carotid endarterectomy in patients with mild stroke formed the final cluster. Except for treatment of severe hypertension there was a wide variation in the physicians' enthusiasm for the various treatments. Possible explanations for this variation include physicians' lack of awareness of the results of clinical trials, the wide range of risk reductions found in various trials of the same therapy, an unwillingness by physicians to generalize from clinical trials to individual patients, individual physicians' placement of different values on the morbidity associated with various diseases, and the fact that physicians may rarely explicitly compare the usefulness of therapies. In general, the number of patients needed to be treated to save one life better reflected the physicians' judgements than did the relative risk reduction.\r"

To determine the prevalence of active tuberculosis at the first surveillance clinic visit and the incidence of the disease over a 2-year to 6-year follow-up period, we reviewed the records of all 523 immigrants admitted to Manitoba between 1981 and 1985 who were placed under surveillance. Of the 523, 429 (82%) were seen at least once in the clinic. Among the 429, active tuberculosis was diagnosed at the first visit in 12 (3%) and during the follow-up period in 7 (2%). The relative risk of tuberculosis was 4.5 times higher for immigrants under surveillance than for those not under surveillance. Of the 483 immigrants who were to be seen in Winnipeg 232 (48%) were noncompliant: 94 were not seen at any time, and 138 did not attend for the full follow-up period. Active disease was not reported to have developed in any of the noncompliant subjects. Noncompliers were significantly older than compliers (p less than 0.005), and variations in compliance were noted according to region of origin. Further attempts to improve compliance with surveillance without resorting to punitive measures are indicated.\r"

Of the 3740 women who had some labour 1127 (30.1%) were given a diagnosis of dystocia. Cesarean section for dystocia was done during all phases of labour (41% of procedures in the latent phase, 38% in the active phase and 21% in the second stage). The cesarean section rate varied among the hospitals from 11.8% to 19.6%. A total of 75% of the cesarean sections were for dystocia, disproportion or failed induction. The findings suggest that cesarean section is being done for disproportion without a trial of labour beyond the latent phase and for dystocia in the absence of fetal distress. If these practices were modified the cesarean section rate could be reduced from 16% to about 8%, the rate found in some other centres and that observed in Canada in the early 1970s.\r"

  ".W": "The effective treatment of systemic cancer began in the 1950s on two fronts, i.e., childhood leukemia and choriocarcinoma. These two diseases were successfully treated as a direct result of the use of antifolate methotrexate. The demonstration of complete durable remissions in these diseases quickly led to development of other anticancer drugs, tested using the prospective clinical trials. In the 1960s as the number of active drugs increased, combination chemotherapy was introduced. Other systemic cancers, such as Hodgkin's, large cell lymphoma, and testicular cancer, became curable in the 1970s. For the common low-growth fraction solid tumors, the curability of systemic disease remained elusive until the introduction of adjuvant therapy to treat micrometastases. The past decade of the 1980s has seen improvement in the outcomes for breast cancer, osteosarcoma, and possible colon cancer utilizing adjunctive chemotherapy. The 1980s also saw the introduction of biologic therapies that have further improved the outcomes of several leukemias and produced consistent responses in patients with renal cell and melanoma. The 1990s will undoubtedly see more improvements as the effects of current drugs will be enhanced not only by improved integration of systemic and local therapies but also by utilizing cytokines and biologic response modifiers in concert with cytotoxics. Moreover, as we understand more about the process of cancer induction, promotion, and progression, more specific anti-cancer approaches will be developed to control cancer even before clinical cancer is diagnosed. Underlying and facilitating the improvement in cancer therapy have been not only the experimental results of many laboratory scientists but also the outcomes from many controlled clinical trials, the laboratory of clinical scientists.\r"

  ".U": "90150001\r", 
  ".W": "The advent of prepayment systems in hospitals has greatly shortened the length of stay of patients who are therefore increasingly treated and cared for in outpatient settings while living at home with family or other caretakers. This shift in the locus of treatment has created a critical need for the development of organized systems of follow-up that monitor a patient's needs while he or she is undergoing active treatment but living at home. Over time, failure to develop such systems of care is likely to result in major gaps in the continuity of care, a decrease in the quality of patients' lives while on treatment, tremendous stress on caretakers, and a general decrease in the quality of services provided to patients. This article reports on a study of one such system of monitoring i.e., a computer-automated telephone outreach system that would routinely assess the concrete needs of chemotherapy outpatients (e.g., transportation to the hospital and need for assistance with activities of daily living). This automated intervention was designed in response to previous findings that 62% of chemotherapy outpatients had at least one unmet need within the month before assessment and 39% had two or more; clinical knowledge that cancer patients' needs vary considerably over time as a consequence of both the disease and its treatment; and that, because of limited professional staff, patients' needs cannot be routinely assessed without the aid of automation, particularly as the proportion of cancer patients treated as outpatients continues to increase. These conditions suggested the need to develop a cost-efficient strategy for the universal assessment of patients' need on a periodic basis, so that emerging needs could be identified in a timely way. For the feasibility study, 97 chemotherapy outpatients were surveyed at least once over the telephone by a computer in a high quality digitally-stored voice asking 12 questions regarding the patients' concrete needs. The data suggested that our computer-automated telephone outreach system is reliable and valid and has the potential for relatively broad-based acceptance. In addition, the intervention frequently allows for timely social work assistance for identified needs. It further serves as a form of outreach that can compensate for patients' reluctance to identify themselves as needing help and for passivity that may be associated with depression or physical illness. This intervention appears to have the potential to be a time- and labor-efficient strategy for ongoing assessment of the changing needs of large numbers of cancer or other chronic diseased outpatients, insuring timely professional intervention as needs arise.\r"

BG-1 contains significant quantities of estrogen and progesterone receptors. Growth inhibition by TAM and growth stimulation by MPA were demonstrated using continuous drug exposure. Estradiol resulted in a marginal increase in colony formation. With each of these three drugs, the greatest response occurred in the larger colonies (generally greater than or equal to 60 microns). Combinations of each of these three steroidal agents with three different cytotoxic drugs were studied in the HTCA. Synergistic activities were produced with TAM combined with either cisplatin or doxorubicin. Additive effects were seen with TAM and cyclophosphamide. Although predominantly additive or synergistic, the effects were variable with MPA and all three cytotoxic agents. Combinations of estradiol with cytotoxic agents were no more active than the cytotoxics alone. These findings indicate a biological rationale for hormonal manipulation as therapy in ovarian cancer.\r"

The treatment results of 526 black women who received definitive therapy for Stage I-III breast cancer at Cook County Hospital, 1973 through 1987 are presented. The 5-year and 10-year projected survival rates for 272 node-negative patients (83.9% and 76.6%, respectively) and for 72 node-positive nonadjuvant treated patients (58.1% and 35.2%, respectively) are similar to those reported in the literature for nonblack patients. Adjuvant therapy improved the projected relapse-free (P = 0.0744) and overall survival curves (P = 0.0448) for 182 node-positive patients compared with nonadjuvant patients. The greatest benefit was seen for patients greater than 50 years of age with one to three positive nodes. The incidence of estrogen and progesterone receptors was found to be similar to those reported for nonblack patients. Once breast cancer has been diagnosed and appropriately treated, there appear to be few differences in the natural history of breast cancer between black and nonblack patients.\r"

Chemotherapy regimens consisted of bleomycin (10 mg/m2), vincristine (1.4 mg/m2, 2 mg maximum) and Adriamycin (doxorubicin) at either 10 mg/m2 (Group I) or 20 mg/m2 (Group II). The therapy was given intravenously, every 2 weeks, until intolerable toxicity or maximum antitumor response. Thirty-three patients were treated. Although the patient populations were similar regarding pretreatment prognostic factors, the patients were not assigned randomly to these two treatment regimens. Major responses (complete or partial remission) were attained in 79% of the cases. The treatment-related toxicities consisted of mild to moderate nausea, hair loss, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Bone marrow suppression consisted primarily of neutropenia (less than 1000/mm3) which occurred in a third of the patients. Variables significantly associated with shorter survival included hemoglobin (less than 10 g/dl), low Karnofsky performance status (less than 70%), and weight loss. Opportunistic infections occurred in the majority of cases during administration of chemotherapy, and were most likely related to severe cell-mediated immune dysfunction and low CD4-positive lymphocyte counts.\r"

Thirteen of them developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) without having any recognized reason for the development of pulmonary edema. This problem showed no correlation with age or prior chemotherapy. Four of the patients recovered, but in nine this complication was fatal. The authors have reviewed the clinical course of these 13 patients and the postmortem findings of the seven patients who had an autopsy performed. The pulmonary tissue from six patients showed massive edema and one had diffuse alveolar damage. Histologic examination revealed a highly proteinaceous intraalveolar infiltrate without any inflammatory reaction in all cases. Intestinal tissue from all patients revealed changes compatible with cytotoxic damage, and pleura and/or pericardium from six of the seven patients showed an extensive fibrinous exudate suggestive of capillary leakage. The time sequence of the clinical events and the histologic findings indicate that high-dose Ara-C treatment in leukemia may cause a capillary leakage syndrome with ARDS that may progress to fatal respiratory failure.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the impact of mammography on the patterns of patients referred for definitive breast irradiation, the records of 1507 cases of carcinoma of the breast in 1468 women treated between 1977 and 1988 with breast-conserving surgery and definitive irradiation were reviewed. All patients had undergone complete excision of the primary tumor with or without axillary staging. All patients had either noninvasive, intraductal carcinoma (American Joint Committee [AJC] Stage Tis, N0) or invasive carcinoma (AJC Stage T1 or T2, N0 or N1). The use of a mammographic needle localization breast biopsy for diagnosis of a nonpalpable carcinoma steadily increased over time from 3% (one of 32) in in 1977-78 to 26% (111/421) in 1987-88 (P less than 0.0001). The percentage of intraductal carcinomas was significantly increased for the cases in which a mammographic needle localization was used for biopsy of a nonpalpable carcinoma (P less than 0.0001). There was an increase in the incidence of intraductal carcinomas in patients referred for definitive breast irradiation over time from 6% (two of 32) in 1977-78 to 13% (53/421) in 1987-88 (P = 0.0004). These results demonstrate that the use of mammography has had a significant impact on the patterns of patients referred for breast conservation and definitive irradiation with an increase in the percentage of nonpalpable cancers diagnosed using mammographic needle localization and with an increase in the percentage of intraductal carcinomas referred over time.\r"

Tracer concentrations in specific sites were correlated with radiologic and pathologic reports and with the clinical courses of the patients studied. There were no significant differences in overall results between newer and older gallium scanning techniques. For untreated patients, the overall sensitivity was only 64%, but the overall specificity was 98%. For untreated patients and for patients with relapsing disease, the presence of gallium concentration in a specific site was highly predictive of active Hodgkin's disease at that site. However, for routine follow-up of treated patients, 95% of unsuspected relapses were missed by the scan, indicating the limited usefulness of negative scan results in this setting. For patients with residual abnormalities after therapy, demonstrated by other radiographic means, increased uptake of gallium in abdominal or peripheral lymph nodes also indicated active disease, although lack of uptake was reliable only in the mediastinum. Based on these results, it appears that the higher doses used in this study have not substantially improved the role of gallium scanning in this disease. Although it is potentially useful in providing confirmatory data at diagnosis or in patients with new or residual objective abnormalities after treatment, routine use of gallium scanning in Hodgkin's disease is not recommended.\r"

An explanation would be made of the inertia of tumor-supplying vessels based on their retarded response to vasoactive drugs. It was noted that as arteries advance from a distance toward the inside of a tumor, their media loses smooth muscles gradually, and become amuscular tubes incapable of blood flow regulation. This appears responsible for the abnormal hemodynamics of tumor tissues. Host arteries embedded in cancer were often deformed to aneurysmal or crumpled shapes; this, which also results from relaxation of atonic vessels, was considered to be the pathologic background for the unusual vascular images characteristic of cancer angiograms.\r"

The 295 patients who underwent hepatectomy from 1973 through 1987 were included for a univariate and a Cox multivariate analysis. The favoring conditions were determined as follows. The essential requirements are (1) the absence of tumor thrombi; (2) no intrahepatic metastasis, but even when present, it should be close to the main tumor and removed with a massive resection; and (3) retention rate of indocyanine green dye (ICG) at 15 minutes should be within 14 +/- 4.2% (M +/- SD) to allow that resection. The desired requirement is that the tumor size should preferably be less than 5 cm; a wider free margin from tumors (greater than or equal to 1 cm) is recommended, but not determining factor. The eligible patients, having no thrombi, no intrahepatic metastasis, a tumor size of 5 cm or less, negative surgical margin (greater than or equal to 1 cm), had achieved a 5-year survival of 78%. In conclusion, resection therapy is the first option for patients with those requirements.\r"

Three patients returned to work and the remainder led a relatively comfortable existence at home until their demise. At the time of death, four patients had no visible perineal disease.

  ".W": "One hundred seventy-five consecutive patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the limb and limb girdle were studied using univariate and multivariate analysis. The most important factor determining risk of local recurrence was the quality of treatment of the primary tumor, with wide or radical surgery plus radical radiotherapy obtaining the best local control. Tumor size, site, and histologic grade were not predictive of local recurrence. The important tumor variables predicting survival were tumor size at first presentation and histologic grade. Tumors with greater than 10 cm greatest diameter and high-grade tumors carried a poor prognosis. Local recurrence was significantly associated with reduced survival, but only when (correctly) considered as a time-dependent variable in multivariate analysis. Irradiation was also significantly associated with poor survival. Review of the literature indicates that local recurrence is believed to have little influence on survival. Since the relevant randomized controlled trials have been small, the evidence is inconclusive.\r"

Chromosomal analysis of the RCC showed a translocation that involved chromosomes 3 and 8 with subsequent loss of the derivative chromosome 8. The patient's peripheral lymphocytes showed a normal karyotype that indicated that there was not a constitutional chromosomal translocation. This is the third reported case of RCC in a patient with VHL in which loss of a portion of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) has occurred. Similar chromosomal changes that involve 3p have been reported in both familial and sporadic cases of RCC and have led to speculation that a tumor suppressor gene may be located in this region. Cytogenetic characterization of renal tumors could assume increasing significance in the diagnosis and classification of RCC and potentially may guide therapy. These studies may also lead to a better understanding of the biologic behavior of RCC and result in more informed patient evaluation and counseling.\r"

Data on extended-field radiotherapy (EF), involved-field (IF), chemotherapy alone, combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CM), disease stage, laparotomy staging, and complications were gathered. A proportional hazard rate was used to estimate and compare relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival rates (S). Iteratively reweighted least square analysis was used to estimate survival curves. Twelve-year RFS for CM (889 patients) was significantly superior to EF (1350 patients) (P less than 0.01). Twenty-year RFS in EF was better than IF (760 patients) (P less than 0.01).

  ".W": "On examination of the thyroid glands in 408 consecutive autopsy cases, 64 occult papillary carcinomas (OPC) were found in 46 cases (11.3%) whose age ranged from 16 to 82 years. Their incidence was 26 of 247 (10.5%) in male and 20/161 (12.4%) in female cases. No definite correlation was found between the incidence of carcinoma and sex or age. All 64 carcinomas were less than 7.7 mm in diameter. They exhibited nuclear characteristics of papillary carcinoma although their growth patterns were \"follicular\" in the tumors less than 1 mm, and \"papillary\" in 70% of the tumors more than 3 mm in diameter. The carcinomas were classified into three types according to the presence or absence of capsular formation and fibrosis: encapsulated tumors (ET), nonencapsulated sclerosing tumors (NEST), and nonsclerosing tumors (NST). The NEST (28 tumors) and NST (26 tumors) were found in persons of all ages, whereas ET (ten tumors) were found only in those of older than 53 years. The mean tumor diameters of the three types, 4.57 mm for ET, 2.10 mm for NEST, and 0.85 mm for NST, were significantly different. These findings suggested that papillary carcinomas arose as minute carcinomas showing follicular pattern at any age as NST and then changed to NEST and ET, and papillary pattern became prominent if the tumors continued to grow. Very minute carcinomas were detected in serial sections of two of 27 fibrosclerotic nodules. Occult papillary carcinomas were found at significantly high incidence in cases with adenomatous goiter.\r"

Paraffin-embedded blocks from 77 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were dewaxed and made into a suspension by mechanical mincing and enzymatic digestion. The nuclei were stained with propidium iodide, and the DNA content evaluated with flow cytometric study. The DNA index (DI) and the coefficient of variation were determined and the results were compared with other pathologic prognostic features. DNA aneuploidy was identified in 70.1% of the specimens and found to correlate significantly with both histologic grading (P less than 0.025) and the incidence of postoperative recurrence (P less than 0.05). Although the 5-year survival was slightly better in the euploid group than in the aneuploid group (28.8% and 19.1%, respectively), this difference was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.1). There was no correlation of the DI with the extent of wall penetration by the tumor, the incidence of lymph node metastases, or the surgical staging, features previously shown to correlate with prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma.\r"

The percentage of S-phase cells was a good predictor of survival. If more than 6% S-phase cells were present in the DNA histogram, both crude survival (P = 0.0001) and survival corrected for intercurrent deaths (P = 0.0001) were clearly inferior as compared with tumors with less than 6% S-phase cells.

Paraffin-embedded specimens of 75 resected adenocarcinomas (AC) of the esophagogastric junction were studied by flow cytometric DNA analysis to determine whether tumor ploidy was a significant prognostic variable independent of stage and histologic grade of the tumor. Eighty-one percent of the tumors were aneuploid. More patients with aneuploid tumors had lymph node metastases than patients with diploid tumors (P = 0.007). Patients with aneuploid tumors had poorer 18-month disease-free and overall survival than patients with diploid tumors. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the most important prognostic variables for predicting overall survival were lymph node status, depth of wall invasion, and tumor differentiation. Tumor ploidy was not an independent prognostic variable in predicting recurrent disease or death from AC of the esophagogastric junction. Tumor DNA content is valuable, however, as a marker for patients at increased risk of lymph node metastases, early recurrence, and poorer survival.\r"

Among pancreatic islet cell tumors, those with middle molecular weight (NF-M)-positive cells were more abundant than those with high molecular weight (NF-H)-positive cells; nearly all of these tumors expressed CR. Although NF-M was abundantly expressed in greater than 50% of tumor cells in a subset of these tumors, only one of these tumors exhibited diffuse immunoreactivity with NF-H. Among rectal carcinoid tumors, NF-M and NF-H-positive cells were present in approximately the same number of tumors, yet only diffuse immunoreactivity to NF-H could be detected. Chromogranin immunoreactivity in greater than 50% of tumor cells was present in 74% of islet cell tumors, 93% of ileojejunal carcinoids, and 83% of appendiceal carcinoids, but only in a minority of rectal carcinoids (36%). Although ileojejunal carcinoid tumors rarely expressed NF-M and did not express NF-H, diffuse immunoreactivity with CR was present in nearly all of these tumors. None of the appendiceal carcinoid tumors expressed NF-M or NF-H, yet all of these tumors demonstrated immunoreactivity with CR. Neurofilament immunoreactivity was not detected in normal GIT and pancreatic NE cells, whereas CR immunoreactivity was always present. These results suggest that for NE neoplasms of the GIT and pancreas the differential expression of NF subtypes appears to be related to tumor site; and CR is a marker of most GIT and pancreatic NE neoplasms although NF may discriminate subtypes of GIT and pancreatic NE tumors. Neurofilament subtyping may be useful in the evaluation of the origin of NE tumors presenting as metastatic lesions.\r"

Three patients had multifocal carcinoma in situ of the bladder without evidence of invasion, and one patient had multifocal high-grade noninvasive papillary carcinoma. Urethral carcinoma in situ was observed in four of 14 patients (29%) with multifocal carcinoma in situ of the bladder, in three cases extending into the periurethral glands. This frequent concurrence of carcinoma in situ of the bladder with urethral and periurethral gland involvement, analogous to the carcinomatous involvement of the prostatic urethra and ducts in male patients, warrants caution in the intravesical therapy of female patients with superficial bladder cancer. The urethra showed invasive carcinoma in three of 18 patients (17%) with invasive bladder cancer (stromal invasion in two cases and vascular invasion in one). This finding reconfirms the use of routine urethrectomy in conjunction with cystectomy in female patients with invasive bladder cancer. An incidental finding was the presence of condylomatous changes in the urethra in five cases (23%).\r"

Comparison of the outcomes at 4 and 10 months after diagnosis manifested a significant and consistent improvement in physical functioning. In contrast, there was an absence of any improvement in indicators of mental health and well-being. Whereas the cross-sectional analyses demonstrated that stage of disease had an impact on physical impairment, the longitudinal analyses revealed that physical impairment at time 1 was the significant predictor of deteriorating mental health at time 2. Furthermore, younger age was shown to exacerbate the impact of impairment on mental health. The more seriously impaired younger patients experienced significantly greater deterioration in their mental health and well-being than similarly impaired older patients. However, older age was found to exacerbate the impact of more extensive surgery on symptoms that produce limitations in activity.\r"

The results of 1 year's follow-up from screening were defined as the gold standard and test performance values were calculated. Sensitivity of screening with photofluorography by a mirror camera, photofluorography by an image intensifier, and direct radiography was 90%, 89%, and 91%, and specificity was 86%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristics curve for screening with photofluorography by an image intensifier resembled that for direct radiography and these two curves were located somewhat to the left of the curve for screening with photofluorography by a mirror camera. The authors conclude that the validity of screening with photofluorography by an image intensifier is almost equivalent to that of screening with direct radiography and both are superior to that of screening with photofluorography by a mirror camera.\r"

We found that MPGN-type DIDD in 12 patients was associated with nephrotic syndrome in 12, persistent hypocomplementemia in 10 and progression to chronic renal insufficiency in 8. In 9 patients with the focal segmental variety of DIDD, nephrotic syndrome was observed in 3, persistent hypocomplementemia in none, and progression to renal insufficiency in 2 (significance: nephrotic syndrome, p = 0.001; persistent hypocomplementemia, p = 0.0001; chronic renal insufficiency, p = 0.02). In one patient transition from focal segmental to MPGN-type DIDD was observed.

Female Munich Wistar rats were prefed for one week prior to 5/6 nephrectomy and followed for the ensuing 28 days. Fish oil, safflower oil and protein restriction prevented the gammaglobulinuria but only fish oil lessened the albuminuria in this model. The remnant nephrons of the fish oil treated rats contained less arachidonic acid and greater quantities of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid than the safflower oil or lab chow fed control rats. The fish oil, and to a lesser extent the safflower oil, treated animals had a higher ratio of 6 keto PGF1 alpha to TX B2 metabolites in their urine. We suggest these changes may be responsible for the lessening in urine protein excretion. Fish oil feeding was more effective than severe protein restriction or safflower oil dietary supplementation in lessening both the gammaglobulinuria and albuminuria of the remnant nephron model.\r"

In this model we derived prescriptions for the concentration of inulin and PAH in the infusion procedure. The resulting improvement was verified by the F-test on the variance of plasma concentration in a 3-hour examination of 15 patients. The final results are of direct benefit to the patient because the number of blood samples required for the control of the steady-state plasma level can be reduced. Furthermore, we derived an individual correction of the so-called input steady-state clearance (without urine collection) which relates better to the usual output clearance of inulin or PAH. A PC-BASIC program is available that calculates the proper concentrations for the infusion and executes the complete analysis (GFR, ERPF, filtrate fraction [FF], maximal tubular transport of PAH [TmPAH] and the renal vascular resistance [RVR], each of which is related to the BSA and the age of the patient).\r"

The levels of blood urea nitrogen, proteinuria, serum uric acid, beta 2-microglobulin in sera and the degrees of glomerular sclerosis in renal tissues in macrohematuric patients were significantly decreased than those in patients without EMH. The levels of uric acid clearance (Cua) and fractional excretion of uric acid (FEua) was significantly enhanced in macrohematuric patients (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively). There was a significant correlation between the tubular atrophy and the levels of Cua in macrohematuric patients (p less than 0.005). The levels of serum creatinine in macrohematuric patients before and after three years were significantly decreased when compared with microhematuric patients (p less than 0.005). It is concluded that enhanced Cua was related to renal tubular atrophy, and EMH did not clinically influence the glomerular deterioration in patients with IgAN.\r"

Their baseline hemoglobin levels were less than 9 g/dl. The absorption of rHuEPO via the i.p. route was limited. The serum erythropoietin (EPO) level was only slightly elevated from a baseline value of 27 +/- 3 mU/l to a plateau of 36 +/- 4 mU/l at 12-24 hours. In comparison, after s.c. injection, a peak EPO level of 81 +/- 13 mU/l was obtained after 24 hours. The areas under the concentration-time curve from 0-24 hour were 803 +/- 67 and 1492 +/- 165 mU/l.h for the i.p. and s.c. group respectively (p less than 0.003). The same two groups of patients were then given rHuEPO by either the s.c. or the i.p. route over a period of 16 weeks. In the s.c. group, the hemoglobin increased significantly from 6.9 +/- 0.3 g/dl to 9.8 +/- 0.6 g/dl (p less than 0.004). The mean rHuEPO dosage was 84 +/- 9 U/kg body wt/week. In the i.p. group, despite relatively higher rHuEPO dosage (133 +/- 7 u/kg body wt/week), the hemoglobin level did not increase significantly (7.0 +/- 0.4 g/dl to 8.0 +/- 0.4 g/dl, p = 0.09). Subcutaneous administration of rHuEPO is effective and convenient for patients maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.\r"

Morphometric analysis revealed statistically significant hypertrophy of the glomeruli and significant reduction in the number of glomeruli when compared with controls of similar age. These findings suggested that not only the loss of one kidney, but also congenital reduction of nephrons contributed to the development of focal glomerular sclerotic lesions in this patient. There have been five reported cases of unilateral renal agenesis with oligomeganephronia in a solitary kidney [Van Acker et al. 1971, Griffel et al. 1972, Lam et al. 1982, Bhathena et al. 1985].

  ".W": "Unilateral medial meniscectomy was undertaken in 29 purebred adult merino sheep. Arthrotomy (without meniscectomy) was conducted in 11 animals, and six were used as nonoperated controls. All animals were followed with either three- or six-month active or passive postoperative management. Active animals traversed a total of 360 km after three months and 1040 km after six months. The passive group was housed in pens allowing limited weight-bearing exercise. After death, morphologic changes were recorded and cartilages from the medial and lateral joint regions were examined for water, collagen, and proteoglycan (as hexuronate) content. Proteoglycan aggregation and extractability under nondissociative (0.4 molar GuHCl) and dissociative (4.0 molar GuHCl) conditions were also determined. The collagen content of the medial cartilage of the passively maintained meniscectomized animals was reduced, relative to external controls. Although proteoglycan content was elevated in medial cartilage of the passive group three months postoperatively, these levels returned to the control range after six months. However, low-salt (0.4 molar GuHCl) extractability of proteoglycans still remained high. All cartilages of control and meniscectomized joints showed an elevation of proteoglycan content in the active groups three months postoperatively. The cartilages in the medial region of meniscectomized animals showed the largest increase, but these levels declined after six months. Proteoglycan aggregation and water content were still elevated relative to controls six months postoperatively. The collagen levels in the three-month or six-month actively maintained meniscectomized group were not distinguishable from control values. Morphologically, joints of the passively and actively maintained animals showed focal surface fibrillation and erosions. However, in the active group, osteophytes were common and well developed six months postoperatively. These studies indicate that, while weight-bearing exercise after meniscectomy appears to be beneficial to the quality of the cartilaginous matrix, it is also accompanied by osteophytosis and cartilage hyperplasia.\r"

Histologically, the grafts demonstrated a decrease in the number of metabolically active cells after transplantation but had a normal cellular distribution and Na2(35)SO4 uptake by three months. The allografts appeared to function normally after transplantation.

A kinesiologic testing device continuously registered distal humeral migration, abduction angle, rotation, and flexion-extension. No distally directed force was applied to the humerus except the weight of the apparatus. Significant distal migration was recorded in the entire range of abduction (0 degrees -60 degrees) after solitary severance of the coracohumeral ligament as well as the proximal part of the anterior joint capsule. Further sectioning of the proximal part of the posterior capsule did not significantly increase distal humeral migration. Maximum distal migration (25 mm) was measured at 20 degrees of abduction. Applying an internal torque to the humerus significantly prevented distal migration as long as the posterior capsule was kept intact. Clinical testing for distal humeral migration should be performed with the shoulder joint at 20 degrees of abduction and neutral rotation. Furthermore, distal humeral migration can be significantly reduced by internal rotation of the humerus when the posterior joint capsule is intact.\r"

The clinical presentation of this type of shoulder dislocation is unique, with the affected extremity held rigidly above the head in abduction. Reduction is accomplished by a form of traction-countertraction under intravenous sedation and analgesia. A variety of neurologic and vascular injuries may be associated with luxatio erecta humeri, involving the brachial plexus and axillary artery, respectively. Concomitant fracture of the acromion, clavicle, coracoid, greater tuberosity, and humeral head may also be seen. A computed tomography scan of the case reviewed here revealed a large humeral head defect oriented perpendicular to the classic Hill-Sachs lesion. Luxatio erecta humeri is associated with significant late morbidity, including recurrent dislocation, instability, and adhesive capsulitis.\r"

Since acromial shape may play a role producing a resistant impingement syndrome, special attention should be paid to patients with Type III of acromial inclination. The surgical procedure should include a thorough examination of the subacromial space as a whole, taking notice of all pathologic findings in the subacromial arch as well as in the underlying soft tissues. Restoring subacromial clearance, the patients were relieved of their symptoms. The result, rated according to the functional assessment of Neer, was excellent or satisfactory in 73%. Failure to recognize the associated bony as well as soft-tissue subacromial lesions was, however, a frequent cause of failure of surgical decompression operations.\r"

The autograft augmentations were uniformly successful. Two fixation failures occurred in the allograft group. Considering the extreme deficiency in the acetabulae encountered and the absence of sufficient autograft material in this group of patients, the use of frozen allografts (although less successful in this series) seems justified.

Pain and disabilities of activities of daily living (ADL) due to PF-OA most likely appeared during movements requiring deep flexion of the knee. Roentgenographic findings revealed a great majority of the disease occurred on the lateral side of the PF joint, both in cases of PF-OA alone and in PF-OA combined with FT-OA. There was no relationship between the degree of PF-OA advancement determined by roentgenographic findings and that of ADL disabilities. PF-OA and FT-OA seemed to be caused by different etiologic factors, because the degrees of involvement of the PF and FT joints were not correlated with each other in the cases of PF-OA combined with FT-OA. Since a clear history of dislocation or subluxation of the patella was noted in 18% of PF-OA (this figure increased to 28% if limited to the cases affected with PF-OA alone), and since roentgenographic findings also agreed with this evidence, dislocation or subluxation of the patella seemed to be one of the causes of PF-OA.\r"

Four cases of osteoid osteoma of the talus or calcaneus are reported, indicating some of the problems encountered with their identification, and suggestions are made for appropriate investigations to aid in the early and correct diagnosis. The use of plain tomograms, thin-section computed tomograms, and radionuclide scans aid an early and correct diagnosis. Arthroscopy and arthrotomy are often inappropriate.\r"

However, because loosening and sinking of the prosthesis were significant, a ceramic total prosthesis was designed in 1980 to be used without cement. Between 1980 and 1987, 39 ankles in 35 patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and hemophilic arthritis were replaced using the ceramic prosthesis. Out of 39 ankles, nine were replaced with cement and 30 without cement. The follow-up period for the cemented metal and ceramic cases ranged from 13.4 to 6.2 years, with an average of 8.1 years, and for uncemented ceramic cases from 1.2 to 6.4 years, with an average of 4.1 years. Based on a rating scale for ankle evaluation, 27% of the cemented cases and 67% of the uncemented cases are satisfactory. Five metal ankles and one ceramic ankle were reoperated upon, with one revision and five arthrodeses performed. Ceramic total ankle arthroplasty, performed without cement, has to date provided mostly excellent stable results.\r"

The characteristics of the fractures in both treatment groups showed no significant differences. The follow-up analysis revealed no statistical differences in outcome between the two methods. However, because of the many factors analyzed and the restricted number of patients studied, it is impossible to compare all factors independently. Surgical treatment resulted in a higher rate of complications (such as implant failure, osteitis, and refracture) and a longer total hospitalization time. Conservative treatment showed a longer duration of fracture healing and a higher rate of malalignment. Malalignments of up to 10 degrees with no adverse effects have been seen so far. In conservative treatment, two fracture types were identified with a higher rate of malalignment: short oblique isolated tibial fractures and fully dislocated transverse crural fractures. Conservative therapy is favored, because there is less discomfort for the patient and the treatment is cost contained.\r"

It can be highly unstable; none of the orthopedic appliances has been designed with this fracture in mind. Compression screws yield better results than Enders rods in these fractures. However, eight patients (16%) in this study who were treated with a compression screw did have a complication. Thus, further studies need to be done to develop other orthopedic appliances for these unstable fractures. Enders rods and compression screws were used to treat 72 unstable intertrochanteric/subtrochanteric fractures. The type of surgical procedure was determined by the surgeon. Anesthesia time and blood loss were significantly lower in the group treated with the Enders nail. Intraoperative and postoperative complications of the Enders group were reported in four (20%) and eight patients (32%), respectively, as compared to zero and eight patients (16%) in the compression screw group. Postoperative time to ambulation, knee pain, and reoperation rate were significantly higher in those treated with the Enders nail.

Slotted (Grosse-Kempf) and nonslotted (Russell-Taylor) locked nail systems were implanted in anatomic specimen femora, which were then tested in torsion and axial compression. For torsional studies, each femur was transversely sectioned distal to the isthmus; for axial loading, a distal 3-cm section of bone was removed. The mean peak torsional stiffness of the femora fixed with nonslotted nails was 0.955 Nm per degree, which was significantly greater than that (0.300 Nm per degree) for the femora fixed with the slotted nails. However, when loaded to failure in compression, the nonslotted nail group failed at a mean load of 2490 N compared with 3050 N for the group fixed with the slotted devices. These results could be due in part to the lesser rigidity of the slotted nail, which may have facilitated greater load sharing with bone and increased resistance to compression failure.\r"

A useful patient registry system is reported here for the storage and retrieval of data on orthopedic patients treated by surgical residents at a major teaching hospital and its affiliates. The registry uses a simple, yet powerful encoding scheme to describe patient entries. In addition to a multidimensional encoded description based on SNOMED, the system supports the entry of free text to provide greater detail. This combination gives the patient registry both power and versatility.\r"

Two predominant cell phenotypes were seen in the culture system. A rapidly proliferating mat of alkaline phosphatase-negative cells supported the growth of overlying clusters of alkaline phosphatase-positive cells. The appearance and subsequent population growth of the alkaline phosphatase-positive cells correlated directly with increases in enzyme activity on biochemical assay. Alkaline phosphatase production was optimal at lower oxygen tensions (5%, 9%), which approximated capillary pO2. In addition, the preconfluence oxygen environment was more critical to the final expression of the enzyme activity than the postconfluence environment. The mechanism of the environmental regulation of alkaline phosphatase gene expression at various oxygen tensions is not known. Periosteal cells were highly sensitive to oxygen tension and expressed alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity at oxygen levels approximating capillary rather than atmospheric pO2.\r"

This study compares the biology of the Nd-YAG laser to that of electrocautery and scalpel techniques with respect to its effects on articular cartilage and the meniscus. The contact Nd-YAG laser has advantages over both scalpel and electrocautery with regard to its effects on articular cartilage. It also has significant biologic advantages over electrocautery for meniscal lesions. Although in its infancy in the clinical setting, the contact Nd-YAG laser represents the possible beginning of a new era for application of laser energy in arthroscopy.\r"

Both of the mothers were on methadone maintenance for narcotic dependency prior to the diagnosis of pregnancy. The authors documented maternal intake of diazepam in the range of 40-60 mg/day for a duration of 4-27 weeks prior to delivery. Both infants initially responded well to medical therapy for narcotic withdrawal, but at 7-14 days of age, withdrawal symptoms intensified, requiring an increase in the dosages of Paregoric (UDL Laboratories, Rockford, IL) and opium tincture in both infants and the addition of phenobarbital therapy in one infant. Both infants continued on medical therapy until they reached 1 month of age. Diazepam use by pregnant women can be associated with a later presentation of withdrawal symptoms in the neonate than that induced by the use of other drugs. Close follow-up during the first month of life is warranted for infants exposed to diazepam prenatally.\r"

Its accuracy was evaluated in a group of children, aged 1 month through 10 years, by comparing it with either rectal (n = 65), or oral (n = 48) temperatures obtained with a standard electronic thermometer, IVAC (San Diego, CA). The average elapsed time between readings was 11 minutes. Overall, 60 rectal and 40 oral temperatures (88.5%) were higher with IVAC than with the aural sensor. The difference ranged from -0.7 degrees C to +2.5 degrees C. The correlations between the infrared ear-probe values and the rectal and oral temperature readings were 0.77 and 0.75, respectively. Because the average reading using the aural sensor was lower than that using the IVAC, the sensitivity of the aural sensor for detecting clinically important levels of fever was low. None of seven patients with a rectal temperature of 39 degrees C or more and only 7 of 27 with a rectal temperature of 38 degrees C or more were identified by the aural sensor as having temperatures above these cutoff levels. Similarly, none of three patients with an oral temperature of 39 degrees C or more and only three of eight with an oral temperature of 38 degrees C or more were identified correctly by the aural sensor. The authors conclude that the aural sensor is unsatisfactory for detecting clinically significant fevers in a pediatric outpatient setting.\r"

Of the 631 abuse reports submitted from 1980 to 1982, there were 52 injuries (8.2%) involving the hands. From July 1987 to July 1988 there were 42 hand injuries (13.4%) among 313 reports. In the 94 total cases, 19 (2%) children sustained injury to the hand only, including eight with burns, two with bruises, two with human bites, two with erythema, two with fractures, and one with a laceration. Children with burns to the hand alone were significantly younger than those with other types of injuries. Of the 94 children with hand and other injuries, 18 (20%) required hospital admission. Of the 19 with injuries to the hand only, five required hospital admission. A variety of instruments were used to injure these children. The hand is a delicate organ, and it is frequently the primary or incidental target of child abuse. Familiarity with the patterns and types of hand injury suffered in child abuse is essential for early recognition, reporting, and child protection.\r"

  ".W": "More than 20 million children between ages 6 and 16 years participate in nonschool sports programs, with increasingly more programs being established for younger-age children. A questionnaire based on previous research with adolescent athletes was developed to determine participation motivation of 6- to 10-year-old children. Three hundred fourteen boys participating in a basketball program were interviewed privately with this instrument. Of the 12 participation motivation items, \"learn to do my best,\" \"learn and improve skills,\" \"have a coach to look up to,\" and \"get stronger and healthier\" were most highly rated, whereas \"win games\" and \"become popular\" were rated least important. When responses of 6 and 7 year olds were compared with those of 9 and 10 year olds, older children rated \"feel part of a team\", \"have fun and excitement\" and \"be with and make new friends\" higher at a statistically significant level (p less than 0.05). Older children rated \"win games\" and \"become popular\" lower at a statistically significant level (p less than 0.05). The authors conclude that young children in this recreational sports program make significant distinctions in their participation motivation and that some aspects of participation that motivate them change as they grow older.\r"

Of 188 biopsies taken from children aged 0-15 years over a 4.5 year period, 73 (39%) revealed malignancy. Fifty-six percent of patients with malignant tumors were boys. Lymphoma was the most common tumor (28 patients, 15 with Burkitt's Lymphoma). Sarcoma (15 patients), carcinoma (8 patients), Wilms' Tumor (6 patients), and retinoblastoma (5 patients) were also seen. Lymphomas were most heavily represented in the first 5 years of life, while sarcoma and carcinoma accounted for most of the malignancies in children after 10 years of age. Lymphomas and sarcomas are relatively more common in Zaire than in North America and Europe, while leukemia and central nervous system tumors are notably less common in Zaire. In view of current limitations on health care in rural Zaire, cancer care should be directed toward early diagnosis, quick referral for appropriate surgical care, and use of the limited arsenal of chemotherapy.\r"

Results indicated that mothers who exclusively breast-fed their infant were more likely to be affluent, college educated, and not working outside the home. Mothers who exclusively breast-fed their infants in the hospital and subsequently practiced partial breast-feeding or formula, or cow's milk feeding were more likely to return to the work force within the first 6 postpartum months. Mothers who partially breast-fed their infants in the hospital were more likely to have a low-birth-weight neonate. Stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that greater total family income, a better education, and having more than one child had positive significant effects on exclusive breast-feeding by the first and fourth month. Women who received a formula discharge kit compared with those who did not had a slightly higher probability of initiating partial breast-feeding (10 vs. 7% by the first month; 27 vs. 25% by the fourth month). Maternal employment had a large impact on duration of exclusive breast-feeding. By the fourth month, mothers who were employed had a higher probability of initiating partial breast-feeding (43 vs. 19%) compared with mothers who were not in the work force.\r"

For the 8 test allergens most often found positive (nickel, fragrance-mix, cobalt, chromate, balsam of Peru, carba-mix, colophony, and formaldehyde), one or more individual factors were of significance for the risk of being sensitized, except for chromate and formaldehyde. It is concluded that patch test results can be compared only after stratification of the material or by multivariate analysis.\r"

DMSO in binary and ternary mixtures with various concentrations, the result of adding 0.1 M C18 fatty acids, and of pretreatment with DMSO and olive oil, were studied. Addition of DMSO (binary solutions) resulted in increased or decreased absorption of the solvents related to their water solubility. There was reduced absorption of toluene and trichloroethane in binary mixtures with DMSO, while DMSO in binary mixture with butanol gave a marked increase, with concentrations of 50 and 75%. Pretreatment with DMSO resulted in a decrease in the absorption of toluene and a marked increase in the absorption of butanol. The same tendency was seen when skin was pretreated with olive oil under occlusion. The results indicate that the effect of DMSO is related to the water solubility of the penetrant.\r"

A positive patch test to PTBP-FR was present in 30 patients (1.5%), 24 of whom were women. Exposure to PTBP-FR as a cause of the dermatitis was \"certain\" in 7, \"very likely\" in 6 and \"unclear\" in 17. 67.7% of the patients had a multiple allergy. In 43.3% of the patients, a history of atopy was found. No clear association of PTBP-FR sensitization with allergies to phenolformaldehyde resin (P-FR) or free para-tertiary-butylphenol (PTBP) emerged in this group of 30 patients. This study supports the hypothesis that PTBP-FR and P-FR do not contain the same sensitizers. Follow-up of 26 of the 30 patients showed a favourable course, dependent on identification of the source of exposure, avoidance of further contact and absence of sensitization to multiple allergens.\r"

After the open exposure, the skin was either left open or occluded with plastic. Skin irritancy was assessed by means of visual grading and by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements. Post-exposure occlusive treatment markedly enhanced the irritant response. 5 consecutive daily applications produced more irritation, with or without occlusion, than alternate day application.

We evaluated this relationship in patients who were severely burned, patients who had injury to both brain and body, patients with head injury, and patients receiving high dose barbiturates for head injury. Head-injured patients had a low thyroxine (T4), low triiodothyronine (T3), and high reverse T3. Phenytoin for control of seizures lowered T3 and T4 and increased thyroid-stimulating hormone. Burned patients had a strong negative correlation between NE and T3 (r = -.88, p less than .001). Patients with injury to both brain and body had a weak negative correlation between NE and T3 (r = -.5, p = .06). Patients with head injury showed no correlation between NE and T3. Severely injured patients had a close inverse relationship between elevated NE levels and depressed T3 levels. This relationship appears to depend on an intact CNS, as the relationship was disrupted by head injury and barbiturates.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the endogenous adrenocortical response to sepsis, plasma cortisol concentrations were measured in 37 patients (53 +/- 3 yr of age) with septic shock. Patients were studied 11 +/- 2 h after shock commenced. Vasopressor therapy was required in 35 of 37 patients (median dopamine infusion rate of 11 micrograms/kg.min, range 3 to 74). Plasma cortisol concentrations were increased markedly (median 50.7 micrograms/dl, range 15.6 to 400) above normal values (10 to 20 micrograms/dl) in patients with septic shock. Neither patients who reversed their shock nor those who survived to hospital discharge had significantly different plasma cortisol concentrations from those who did not. Patients with Gram-positive infections had increased cortisol levels compared with those who had Gram-negative infections (median 83 micrograms/dl, range 32 to 400 vs. median 44 micrograms/dl, range 16 to 81, respectively; p less than .05). The source of infection, amount of vasopressors infused, and severity of shock were not associated with differences in cortisol concentrations. The length of time in shock before collection of the blood sample for measurements of cortisol and mean arterial pressure at the time of blood collection had significant but weak negative correlations with cortisol concentrations (p less than .05, rs = .37 and p less than .05, rs = -.40, respectively). We conclude that plasma cortisol concentrations are increased in patients with septic shock, but that the degree of increase is variable. This variability may, in part, be related to type of infection, length of time in shock, and BP at the time of blood sampling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Few prospective studies have been undertaken in neonatal surgical units to investigate colonization and infection rates and the pathogenesis of infection. We prospectively studied 40 infants admitted to a neonatal surgical unit. Ninety-eight percent became colonized in throat/intestine with aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Thirty-five percent developed infections, with wound and surface infections predominant (61%). Ninety-one percent of infections were caused by Gram-negative bacilli or yeasts. Severe infections (septicemia, pneumonia, meningitis) occurred in 13% of infants. The mortality rate was 5%. In all infections, the pathogenesis was found to be endogenous, and in most, three stages were distinguishable. Neonates always acquired potentially pathogenic organisms in throat/intestine (stage 1) before colonization (stage 2) and infection (stage 3) of other systems occurred. Reduction of digestive tract colonization by these potentially pathogenic microorganisms by means of successful selective decontamination may therefore reduce subsequent infection.\r"

Nineteen patients were randomized to receive ranitidine plus antacids if necessary to maintain gastric pH at greater than or equal to 4. The remaining 21 patients were given no drug prophylaxis. Gastric pH was significantly (p less than .001) higher in the treated group: 78% of pH readings were at greater than or equal to 4 as compared to 32% in the control group. However, after five study days, incidence and severity of stress lesions were similar in the two groups: nine patients in each group had more than five erosions, one treated patient had a gastric ulcer, and one control patient had duodenal ulcerations. No patient experienced clinically relevant upper GI bleeding. The lack of severe stress bleeding and the low ulcer rate contrast with results from earlier reports on similar patient populations. Furthermore, drug prophylaxis had no detectable benefit, as assessed endoscopically. These findings suggest that routine stress lesion prophylaxis may not be necessary in critically ill patients with comparable risk factors.\r"

Analysis of the distribution of anion gaps for 56 adult surgical ICU patients with peak blood lactate levels greater than or equal to 2.5 mmol/L showed the anion gap to be an insensitive screen for elevated lactate in a critically ill, hospitalized population. All patients (11/11) with a peak lactate greater than or equal to 10 mmol/L had an anion gap greater than or equal to 16 mmol/L; however, 50% (6/12) of patients with lactates between 5.0 and 9.9 mmol/L and 79% (26/33) of those with lactates between 2.5 and 4.9 mmol/L had anion gaps less than 16 mmol/L. Hyperlactatemia was associated with considerable mortality at all levels: 100% among patients with lactate levels greater than or equal to 10 mmol/L, 75% between 5.0 and 9.9 mmol/L, and 36.4% between 2.5 and 4.9 mmol/L. Acidosis (pH less than 7.30) did not significantly alter mortality by lactate level. The observation that, for 57% of patients in this study, an elevated lactate level was not accompanied by an elevated anion gap suggests that hyperlactatemia should be included in the differential diagnosis of nonanion gap acidosis.\r"

We found no relationship of occurrence of mishaps to severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, APACHE II), number of lines, monitoring and support modalities, and time out of the ICU. Transports for elective procedures had more mishaps (60%) than occurred for emergencies (40%). Most mishaps occurred either during the procedure, on transports to CT scan, or while waiting at the destination. The numbers and types of escorts as defined by our ICU policy and physician attendance on transport did not clearly reduce mishap risk. Morbidity and mortality were not affected by mishaps. Although certain trends did emerge, no clearly defined predictive factor could be identified. Further study into transport mishaps is warranted.\r"

In all patients, NE resulted in either an increase in BP, no change, or an increase in CI and restored SVRI to the normal range. In 20 patients, normalization of systemic hemodynamics was followed by re-establishment of urine flow, decrease in serum creatinine, and increase in creatinine clearance. None of these 20 patients received low dose dopamine or furosemide. Four patients remained oliguric. Two of these four patients died and two developed acute renal failure.

The purpose of this pilot study was to identify early clinical predictors of myocardial damage in patients with high voltage electrical injury. Twenty-four patients with high voltage electrical injuries and no evidence of arc burns were evaluated. In 13/24 patients the diagnosis of myocardial damage was confirmed by total creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) isoenzyme elevation (group A). In these patients the total CK range was 1373 to 52,544 mU/ml. In 11/24 patients CK-MB was negative (group B) indicating absence of myocardial damage. ECG changes occurred in 10/13 group A and 4/11 group B patients (p less than .095). No patient in either group gave a history suggestive of myocardial ischemia after the electrical injury. The pathways of electricity through the body, as mapped by a line drawn between the wound(s) of entrance and exit, were vertical in all group A patients, i.e., from upper to lower body segment, vs. 5/11 group B patients with evidence of a vertical pathway (p less than .003). Group A patients also had greater body surface burns (16.0 +/- 2.7%) vs. group B patients (4.0 +/- 1.6%, p less than .001). The presence of a vertical pathway and the magnitude of percent surface burns were found to be the most significant clinical predictors of myocardial damage in multiple logistic regression analysis (p less than .0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, the effect of oxygen therapy (FIO2 0.6 for 1 wk) and fluorocarbon emulsions (Oxypherol) on erythropoiesis was evaluated. Baboons uniformly survived acute normovolemic anemia with Hct 10%. In all cases, the response to anemia was characterized by a lag period (with no change in Hct), and a nonlinear recovery period. A lag period of 3 days was observed in both moderate and severe anemia for baboons breathing room air or FIO2 0.6. The lag period was prolonged to 1 wk in the presence of Oxypherol. The recovery period exhibited a uniform and negative correlation between the rate of Hct change and the Hct, in all cases. The theoretical maximum rate of increase of Hct was 2.6%/day.

CID therapy ameliorated temporarily the progressive course of hypoxemia and increased extravascular lung water (EVLW), delayed the onset of cardiovascular deterioration, and improved significantly survival time. It was concluded that CID therapy given at 90 min after the onset of lethal continuous P. aeruginosa infusion improved significantly animal survival time by improving temporarily hypoxemia and increase in EVLW and delaying cardiovascular collapse.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between urine oxygen tension (PuO2), PaO2, and acute changes in renal arterial blood flow (RBF) were studied in 19 anesthetized dogs. Indwelling sensors that measure continuously PO2 were inserted into the femoral artery and the ureter. RBF was measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter placed over the renal artery. PuO2 increased significantly from 36 to 72 torr during a stepwise increase in PaO2 from 70 to 180 torr. RBF was decreased in a stepwise fashion from a baseline value of 5.51 to 4.16, 2.13, and finally to .20 ml/kg.min by aortic constriction. PuO2 decreased significantly from a baseline value of 72 torr to 66, 57, and finally to 23 torr. The correlation coefficient between RBF and PuO2 was .84, which was significantly higher than that between RBF and femoral arterial pressure or that between RBF and urinary flow rate. This study demonstrates that PuO2 is a sensitive indicator of acute RBF changes in normal, healthy dogs.\r"

Although the function of carcinine is unknown, its structural similarity to histamine, a compound known to have profound effects on the mammalian heart, and to carnosine (beta-alanylhistidine), a compound which we have previously shown to serve as a histamine source, led to the hypothesis that carcinine may play a role in mammalian cardiac physiology. We therefore administered several doses of carcinine (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 micrograms) to isolated, perfused guinea pig hearts in a Langendorff apparatus. Carcinine exerted a dose-dependent positive inotropic effect, similar to that of histamine. Comparable doses of carnosine yielded no measurable change in contractility. We conclude that carcinine appears to be a positive inotrope in the mammalian heart, and may play a role in cardiac physiology via its metabolic link to histamine.\r"

We propose that this glossopalatal closure acts as a glossopalatal sphincter (GPS). In this investigation, we studied glossopalatal closure by obtaining concurrent manometric and radiographic recordings of barium swallows in healthy volunteers. Manometry was done by both a continuous pull through method and also by a stationary catheter technique using a ribbon catheter with multiple sideholes spaced at 1-cm intervals. The results showed that when the mouth was loaded with a fluid bolus, the closed glossopalatal segment generated an asymmetric high-pressure zone with greater pressures toward the tongue and palate than laterally. With swallowing, the glossopalatal sphincter high-pressure zone relaxed and the glossopalatal sphincter opened to allow barium to flow from the mouth into the oropharynx. We conclude that the glossopalatal sphincter functions as a physiological sphincter in that it (1) generates a sustained high-pressure zone and closure when a liquid bolus is held in the mouth and (2) relaxes and opens with swallowing.\r"

Further, we sought to define the esophageal response to boluses with a wide range of temperatures in nine healthy volunteers. Intraluminal pressure events were measured with an infused catheter system, and lower esophageal sphincter pressure was monitored continuously with a Dent sleeve. Boluses (10 swallows each) consisting of 5 ml of a solid suspension (yogurt), 5 cm3 of a soft solid (gelatin), and 5 ml of water were given in a randomized order. In a separate study, boluses with temperatures of 1 degree C, 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, room temperature, 30 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 60 degrees C were given in a randomized fashion. Compared to the water bolus, the solid boluses elicited a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in peristaltic wave velocity, which was accompanied by significant (P less than 0.05) increments in the durations of wave contraction and lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. The magnitude of the response elicited by the solid boluses was comparable to that noted with boluses of high viscosity suggesting that the esophagus response to increments in bolus viscosity and consistency in a similar fashion. Alterations in bolus temperature did not elicit any significant changes in the parameters of esophageal peristalsis. It is concluded that bolus temperature does not have a significant role in the modulation of human esophageal peristalsis except under conditions that cause a change in esophageal wall temperature.\r"

Phasic gastric contractions may attenuate gastric mucosal blood flow, resulting in ischemia followed by reperfusion. Therefore, the conditions of cold-water-immersion restraint might lead to mucosal injury by an oxyradical-mediated mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of oxyradical inhibition on cold water immersion restraint-induced lesions. In separate groups of rats subjected to cold water immersion restraint (6-10 animals per group), oxyradical inhibition was achieved by chronic feeding of a sodium tungstate diet, oral administration of allopurinol, or intraperitoneal administration of dimethylsulfoxide. None of these regimens significantly attenuated the number of lesions per stomach, the total lesion area, or the percent of corpus mucosa containing lesions. We conclude that oxyradicals do not play a role in the pathogenesis of cold water immersion restraint-induced lesions.\r"

The bandlike lesions induced in the intact stomach by both irritants were significantly and dose-dependently prevented by 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2: 3 and 10 micrograms/kg, subcutaneously), cysteamine (30 and 100 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or timoprazole (10 and 30 mg/kg, per os) at the doses which significantly inhibited gastric motility. In the pylorus-ligated stomach, however, neither of these agents showed any protection against the generalized lesions induced by ethanol, but such lesions caused by aspirin were significantly prevented only by dmPGE2. These agents also showed similar effects against the reduction of transmucosal PD in the pylorus-ligated stomach exposed to ethanol and aspirin. These results suggest that (1) the formation of bandlike lesions caused by ethanol and aspirin depends on the presence of mucosal folds and may be prevented by the agents that inhibit gastric motility, (2) the pathogenesis of the lesions induced by aspirin and ethanol may be different in the pylorus-ligated stomach, and (3) dmPGE2 has a unique protective ability that is not shared by usual cytoprotective agents.\r"

The aims of this prospective study were to look for (1) a pathological DGR profile during fasting and (2) an eventual correlation between DGR profile and clinical symptoms. Twenty-six NUD patients were investigated. Seven other operated patients with a surgical procedure facilitating DGR episodes and 27 healthy volunteers served as control groups. A clinical score was determined for each patient from a standardized questionnaire. Gastric aspiration was performed for 6 hr in fasting subjects. The aspirates were pooled into 17 samples. In each sample the concentration and the output of total bile acids was determined. If the concentration was larger than 30 mumol/liter in pooled samples, the concentrations of free bile acids and the distribution of the conjugated bile acids was determined. The percentage of aliquots with a total bile acid concentration larger than 50 mumol/liter (without upper limit), and the percentage with a concentration larger than 2500 mumol/liter was also obtained. No significant difference was demonstrated between the healthy volunteers and NUD patients, whatever the parameter considered. However, there was a significant increase in each of the quantitative parameters for the group of operated patients in comparison with the NUD patient group. No significant correlation was found between the clinical score and the DGR profile in NUD patients. Apparently, DGR episodes do not play a primary role in the pathogenesis of NUD.\r"

The maximum elevations were 273% for NT1-8, 234% for NT1-11, and 54% for NT1-13. NT8-13 levels failed to rise significantly when compared to basal levels.

In addition, the effect of these bile acids on LPL ornithine decarboxylase activity was also determined. Significant dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation in Con A-stimulated LPL was observed. Parallel inhibition was seen on LPL cell proliferation. Furthermore, bile acids inhibited ornithine decarboxylase activity in Con A-stimulated LPL. These effects on cell proliferation were not due to the LPL cytolysis as viability and cell membrane integrity were not altered. Our results suggest that bile acid has an immunoregulatory function on the human mucosal immune system and may have a role during pathological states.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the anorectal manometric and urodynamic pattern of seven patients who had right and/or left frontal lobe injury to investigate the possibility that the frontal lobe area plays an important role in control of anorectal motility as it does for the urinary bladder. We found that the disturbances of anorectal manometric recordings were similar to those of urodynamic recordings: (1) lack of urinary bladder filling sensation (two cases), increased perception threshold of rectal distension (two cases); (2) uninhibited detrusor contractions during filling (five cases), spontaneous rectal contractions during the resting step (four cases); (3) absence of micturition (one case), absence of rectoanal inhibitory reflex (one case). Furthermore, in all but one patient, we observed a decrease in the amplitude and duration of the voluntary contraction of the anal canal (six cases). However, in two of the seven patients we found hypertonia in the anal canal (upper part: one case, lower part: one case), but never in the urethral canal. Our results suggest that frontal lobe may be involved in the nervous control of anorectal motility as it is for urinary bladder function. However, the lack of correlation between urinary and anorectal anomalies in individual cases suggests that these functions depend on distinct areas of the frontal lobe.\r"

  ".W": "Total hemolytic complement activity and serum complement protein concentrations were compared in 17 hospitalized patients with normal hepatic function and 16 patients with liver disease due to alcohol (15 patients) or acetaminophen toxicity (one patient). In contrast to the control patients, individuals with hepatic dysfunction had decreased total CH50 levels and low concentrations of total C3, C4, C5, factor B, and the regulatory proteins factor I and beta-1H. These patients also had increased C4d/C4 ratios, indicating classical pathway activation. The level of complement deficiency appears to correlate with either prolongation of the prothrombin time or depression of serum albumin concentration. These results indicate that patients with hepatic disease have severe complement depletion that is probably multifactorial in origin. This impairment in complement function will contribute to the impaired antibacterial host defense of the patient with chronic hepatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined cholesterol and mixed gallstone dissolution in vitro by methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) after gallstone fragmentation. Three morphologically identical gallstones were obtained from 42 patients. One stone from each patient was fragmented with laser energy at a wavelength of 504 nm delivered to the stone surface with a 320-microns quartz fiber. Intact and fragmented stones from the same patient were incubated without stirring in MTBE and dissolution was expressed as the percent of initial stone weight remaining after 2 hr. Stone composition did not correlate with the amount of laser energy required for stone fragmentation. Fragmented stones dissolved faster than intact stones in MTBE with 13.97% +/- 0.37% vs 31.0% +/- 0.51% respectively (mean +/- SEM) of initial stone weight remaining at 2 hr (P less than 0.0001). Initial stone weight and stone matrix content significantly predicted dissolution of intact (P = 0.0033 and P = 0.0483, respectively) and fragmented stones (P = 0.003 and P = 0.0001, respectively) in MTBE. These data suggest that the gallstone matrix may inhibit stone dissolution even after stone fragmentation.\r"

  ".W": "The therapeutic effect and the mechanism of action of the synthetic trypsin inhibitor camostate were studied in a rat model of acute interstitial pancreatitis induced by four subcutaneous injections of 20 micrograms/kg body weight of cerulein at hourly intervals. Rats with acute pancreatitis were given either 100 mg/kg body weight camostate or volume- and pH-adjusted water via an orogastric tube 30 min after the last cerulein injection. The elevation of serum amylase activity was significantly reduced by camostate treatment and the peak value was seen 1 hr earlier than that observed in the rats that did not receive camostate. Camostate also inhibited the reduction in pancreatic content of lipase and amylase seen during experimental pancreatitis. These effects were accompanied by alleviation of the histologic signs of acute pancreatitis such as cellular infiltration and acinar cell vacuolization. After oral administration, camostate and its metabolite were absorbed from the intestine and were detectable in plasma for more than 6 hr in concentrations high enough to have antiprotease activity. In addition, camostate in the duodenum was able to increase pancreatic juice flow and protein output and to stimulate endogenous secretin release. These results suggest that oral administration of camostate reduces the severity of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis by releasing endogenous secretin and by its antiprotease activity.\r"

To study the mechanisms of the protective effect of S.b. against enteral pathogen infection, we assessed the response of the intestinal secretion of secretory IgA (s-IgA) and of the secretory component of immunoglobulins (SC) to oral administration of high doses (0.5 mg/g body weight, three times per day) of S.b. cells in growing rats. S.b. cells (biological activity: 2.8 x 10(9) viable cells/100 mg) were administered daily by gastric intubation to weanling rats from day 14 until day 22 postpartum. Control groups received either 0.9% saline or ovalbumin following the same schedule. Expressed per milligram of cell protein, SC content was significantly increased in crypt cells isolated from the jejunum (48.5% vs saline controls, P less than 0.05) as it was in the duodenal fluid (62.8% vs saline controls, P less than 0.01) of rats treated with S.b. Oral treatment with S.b. had no effect on the secretion of SC by the liver. In the duodenal fluid of rats treated with S.b. cells, the mean concentration of s-IgA was increased by 56.9% (P less than 0.01) over the concentration of s-IgA measured in saline controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although one patient had colonic pseudomembranes, neither patient had microbiological evidence of C. difficile toxin or infection. A variety of medications were initially given to these patients without resolution of diarrhea. Only after the diagnosis of collagenous colitis was made and antiinflammatory drugs directed at the colitis given did the diarrhea abate. These cases illustrate an unusual presentation of collagenous colitis with possible implications for pathogenesis.\r"

Despite impressive advances in diagnostic technology, many patients continue to have chronic diarrhea without a firm diagnosis being established. Most important, the history and physical examination are often perfunctory and the patient undergoes a number of contrast and imaging studies, endoscopic procedures, and laboratory investigations which may still be non-diagnostic. In all patients with chronic diarrhea, which I will arbitrarily define as diarrhea that has persisted over at least 2 months, there is a need for a careful orderly approach to the differential diagnosis. In this paper I will detail a method that I have used in evaluating such patients. The method emphasizes a careful history and physical examination, judicious and sequential use of laboratory investigations, contrast studies, and endoscopic procedures, and calls attention to special situations where more detailed investigations are required. I have found that unless I go through this detailed diagnostic approach, I will miss disorders that can be readily diagnosed and, more importantly, such patients may not be given appropriate treatment.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the transient opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during epileptic seizures may lead to permanent neuronal changes, seizures of a few minutes' duration were induced by intravenous (i.v.) administration of 0.3 mg/kg bicuculline to conscious rats with indwelling catheters for blood pressure (BP) and blood gas monitoring. The rats were killed 5 min to 7 days later, and the distribution of endogenous plasma albumin, fibrinogen, and fibronectin in the brain was studied by immunohistochemistry. Parallel sections were scrutinized for evidence of light-microscopic structural changes in the tissue. Extensive multifocal extravasation of plasma proteins throughout the brain and brainstem was observed. The original clearly focal distribution became more diffuse with prolongation of the recovery time. In addition, the intensity of the immunoreactivity decreased, most likely due to drainage into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles and the subarachnoidal space of the extravasated proteins, but some antialbumin-positive material was still visible after 7 days. In areas with extravasation, many nerve cells, especially cerebellar Purkinje cells, became strongly positive for albumin. In some of these areas, neurons appeared to be irreversibly injured. Thus, considerable amounts of plasma proteins are extravasated even during short epileptic seizures, and albumin appear to remain in the tissue for a long time, especially in Purkinje cells. The Purkinje cell loss in chronic epilepsy may be caused partly by cumulative bouts of plasma extravasations.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the relationship between lipid peroxidation, subsequent activation of antioxidative enzymes, and development of iron-induced epilepsy in the rat. Epileptic foci were produced in rat cerebral cortex by intracortical injection of ferric chloride (FeCl3). The epileptic foci were identified by electrocorticography (ECoG). Epileptiform ECoG activity was shown to occur in the contralateral homotopic cerebral cortex as well. We measured levels of lipid peroxides and changes in the activities of the enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GP), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CA), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P) in the epileptogenic focus (both ipsilateral and contralateral) at days 3, 8, 15, and 23 after FeCl3 injection. Biochemical estimations were made in subcellular fractions, and changes in the ipsilateral site were compared with those in the contralateral site. The results of this study showed that large increases in lipid peroxidation were associated with development and buildup of the ECoG epileptiform discharges. Lipid peroxides increased in the ipsilateral focus by approximately 100% as compared with control. In the contralateral site, however, the increase in lipid peroxides was marginal only. The increase in lipid peroxidation was concomitant with development of the high level of epileptiform activity. The time course of changes in lipid peroxidation paralleled the time course of development and persistence of the epileptiform activity. Regarding changes in the enzyme activities accompanying development of iron epilepsy, the data showed that although SOD and G6P increased by approximately 60% and GR increased by approximately 40%, the increases in the enzyme GP and CA were much lower, less than 20%. Thus, comparatively less increase in CA and GP activities produces a deficiency of these two enzymes in the iron (ipsilateral) focus. Among the various biochemical disturbances that have been identified as involved in epileptogenesis, peroxidative injury resulting from lipid peroxidation in neural plasma membrane may be causally related to development of paroxysmal epileptiform activity in the iron focus. Since GP is an enzyme of major importance in detoxification of lipid peroxides in the brain, based on the results presented in this article, it appears reasonable to suggest that GP deficiency causes lipid peroxidation to increase tremendously during iron epileptogenesis.\r"

Seventy patients (49%) reported auras which were classified according to the guidelines recommended by the Commission of the International League Against Epilepsy. Statistical analysis revealed no relationship between presence, laterality, or localization of EEG abnormality and the number or type of aura. The results emphasize that more factors than electrophysiologic localization alone participate in the determination of aura in CPS. Our data support the position that aura has, at most, a limited relationship to lateralization or localization of interictal cerebral dysfunction in CPS.\r"

We present one case of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in which the test results could be statistically confirmed. The tapping test was interrupted by the occurrence of spike-waves. Response times during spike-waves were more delayed than during non-spike-waves in both the simple reaction tests and morphological discrimination tests. The differences in response times measured during spike-waves and during non-spike-waves were significantly greater in the morphological discrimination test than in the simple reaction test. The positive correlation between the length of spike-waves and response time in the discrimination test was significantly more pronounced than in the reaction test. These results were also confirmed in two other patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

Time of CBZ was varied so that the children were tested both shortly after CBZ (when daily CBZ concentrations approached their peak) and before CBZ (when CBZ concentrations approached daily low or trough levels). Testing was blind so that the examiner was unaware of the time of CBZ or the child's type of seizure. Results showed only one group difference related to seizure type and no differences linked to overall CBZ concentration as measured in saliva. Peak and trough concentrations were associated with changes in several variables, however. The children performed significantly better shortly after CBZ (peak concentration day) on measures of seat activity, attention span, and motor steadiness, whereas response times appeared to be influenced in a task-specific manner.\r"

  ".W": "Seven patients with complex partial or secondarily generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus (SE) refractory to benzodiazepines (BZDs) and phenytoin (PHT) were treated with pentobarbital (PTB) coma with an EEG burst suppression (BSP) pattern. PTB administered by continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion pump at a loading dose of 6-8 mg/kg in 40-60 min was usually sufficient to produce BSP activity and seizure control. PTB was continued 0-24 h at 1-4 mg/kg/h, adjusted to maintain blood pressure (BP) and BSP. Infusion rate was decreased if systolic BP (SBP) was less than 90 mm Hg. Normal saline fluid challenge was occasionally used to elevate BP, but in no case was it necessary to discontinue PTB infusion or use pressors. Other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were maintained at therapeutic levels for chronic seizure protection. Seizures were stopped in all cases. Four patients attained premorbid neurologic status, two patients briefly survived in vegetative states with recurring seizures after PTB withdrawal, and one patient died of asystole after receiving PTB for 7 h. Patients who had poor outcomes had prolonged seizures (16 h to 3 weeks) before institution of PTB anesthesia, and all had significant underlying central nervous system (CNS) pathology. PTB-induced BSP appears to be safe and effective for refractory SE if it is started soon after failure of a BZD and PHT. Ultimate prognosis depends on SE etiology.\r"

The major outcome measures used were a 50-item true-false test specifically designed to evaluate the SEE program, the Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, Lubin's Depression Adjective Checklist, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Acceptance of Disability Scale, and Sherer's Self-Efficacy Scale. Significant differences between the two groups were found on the three major subscales of the 50-item true-false test. The treatment group demonstrated a significant increase in overall understanding of epilepsy, a significant decrease in fear of seizures, and a significant decrease in hazardous medical self-management practices. In addition, an objective measure of blood levels of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) showed the treatment group to have a significant increase in medication compliance.\r"

Twelve patients had a generalized epilepsy and 32 a partial epilepsy. All received antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and none had additional handicaps. Despite good facilities in their surroundings for participation in social, cultural, and physical activities, most patients lived a sedentary life. Social contact was limited, and they were only half as active physically as the average Norwegian population of comparable age and sex. Work capacity was tested as maximum oxygen uptake, using the bicycle ergometer test. Maximum oxygen uptake was considerably lower (75-80%), and the decrease observed in aerobic capacity with increasing age was more pronounced than that of the average Norwegian population. In comprehensive care of patients with epilepsy, we believe that prescription of adapted physical activity is an important means of improving quality of life.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one adult in-patients (11 women, 10 men, aged 18-39 years) with uncontrolled epilepsy participated in a 4-week intensive physical training program, exercising for at least 45 min three times a day, 6 days a week, at an intensity of minimum 60% of maximum oxygen uptake (maximum VO2). The program induced a considerable increase in maximum VO2 (mean 19%). Beneficial psychological and social effects were also recorded. The average seizure frequency during the 4-week exercise period was compared with 2 preexercise and 2 postexercise weeks. There was no significant difference, but there was considerable variation among patients. Only six patients had seizures during exercise. The occurrence had no relation to seizure type, mode of activity, or pulse rate. We conclude that physical activity does not represent an important seizure-inducing factor in general, and that in most people with epilepsy physical training appears to have a favorable influence. The exact mechanism behind this influence is not known, but physiologic as well as psychological and social effects may be of importance. Physical training did not change the serum levels of the antiepileptic drugs to a clinically important degree.\r"

After 4-6 mo, parotid salivary flow was induced by stimulating bipolar electrodes (3-5 V for 2 ms) on either the auriculotemporal nerve (5 Hz) or the cervical sympathetic trunk (10 Hz). During parasympathetic stimulation, flow rates were 443 +/- 287 microliters/30 min in diabetic animals compared to 657 +/- 134 microliters/30 min in controls (P less than .01). Although parotid flow rates during parasympathetic stimulation were well maintained in controls, they decreased rapidly in most diabetic rats. Parotid secretory response to sympathetic stimulation was also reduced in diabetic compared with control animals (40 +/- 16 microliters/30 min and 82 +/- 50 microliters/30 min, respectively, P less than .01). In contrast to results obtained with direct neural stimulation, no differences in threshold dose or total saliva were observed when cholinergic (methacholine) and peptidergic (physalaemin) agonists were administered intravenously. Response threshold for an adrenergic agonist (epinephrine) was significantly increased in diabetes. Electron microscopy showed axoplasmic abnormalities in nonmyelinated axons in diabetic glands but not in control glands. Although most nerve profiles appeared normal, neuroaxonal abnormalities were found in every diabetic animal. The ultrastructural findings and the similar responses to methacholine and physalaemin suggest that autonomic neuropathy may be a factor in the abnormal response of the parotid gland to parasympathetic nerve stimulation.\r"

Calorie intake varied from 1800 to 2200 calories, depending on individual needs. Part of the polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acids (omega 6FAs) were isocalorically exchanged with omega 3FAs (2.7 g/day provided by fish oil concentrates) for 10 wk. Subject selection was based on the fact that the atherogenic index (total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-chol]) remained greater than 5. Total cholesterol did not change, but HDL-chol (P less than .05) increased significantly, and the mean +/- SD atherogenic index decreased from 5.9 +/- 1.1 to 5.1 +/- 1.3. Plasma triglyceride levels also decreased (P less than .05). There was a small (approximately 2%) but significant (P less than .05) decrease of whole-blood viscosity at low shear rate because of a similarly small (approximately 2% decrease (P less than .05) of plasma viscosity. Erythrocyte viscosity values and the erythrocyte transit time, measured with the St. George's filtrometer, remained unchanged during fish oil intake. Four weeks after stopping the omega 3FA administration, the triglyceride level was again increased (P less than .05) and was even higher than the starting value (P less than .05). Plasma and whole-blood viscosity also increased to the starting levels, demonstrating that lipid alterations are accompanied with blood viscosity changes in the presence of a stable metabolic control.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic outcross and backcross analysis of nonobese diabetic (NOD/Lt) mice with a related but diabetes-resistant strain, nonobese normal (NON/Lt), has demonstrated that susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is controlled in a recessive fashion by multiple genetic loci, including one (Idd-1s) associated with H-2 on chromosome 17 and another (Idd-2s) associated with Thy-1b/Apoa-1b (formerly Alp-1) on chromosome 9. To analyze the separate pathogenic contributions of Idd-1s and Idd-2s, two distinct congenic stocks of NOD/Lt mice homozygous on chromosomes 17 and 9 for NON/Lt linkage markers for the respective resistance alleles (Idd-1r and Idd-2r) were developed. The recessive nature of Idd-1s was confirmed at the fifth backcross generation in that 83% of females and 29% of males homozygous for NOD H-2 haplotype developed diabetes, whereas no diabetes occurred in any of the mice homozygous or heterozygous for the NON haplotype. However, codominant and recessive MHC-associated susceptibility genes in this congenic stock were indicated by the finding that at least one copy of the NOD/Lt MHC was required for insulitis development. Virtually no insulitis was detected in the pancreases of mice homozygous for NON haplotype at 42 wk of age, whereas heavy generalized insulitis was present in 3 of 19 H-2 heterozygotes and in 7 of 7 diabetic and 3 of 5 nondiabetic mice homozygous for NOD haplotype. Further indication of the presence of MHC-associated codominant and recessive MHC-associated susceptibility genes was the observation that the NOD MHC haplotype correlated in a codominant fashion with a relative increase in the percentage of splenic T-lymphocytes bearing the Ly-2 surface marker. Severe insulitis and concomitant high diabetes incidences occurred in all genotypic classes of congenic mice carrying Thy-1/Apoa-1 linkage markers for either NOD or NON alleles at Idd-2. Molecular analysis indicated that the NON-derived Idd-2r resistance allele had been replaced by recombination with Idd-2s from NOD. Restriction-fragment-length polymorphism analysis of two polymorphic markers proximal to Thy-1, low-density lipoprotein receptor Ldlr and Ets-1, a protooncogene, confirmed a recombinant chromosome 9, because homozygosity for NOD genomic fragments was found centromeric to an NON congenic segment of at least 20 centiMorgans spanning the Thy-1 and Mod-1 loci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The role of potential risk factors was therefore evaluated in a cross-sectional analysis from the baseline examination of the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study. We present results from the first 400 subjects seen at baseline examination. Neuropathy was determined by a trained internist with a standardized examination and was defined as the presence of at least two of three criteria: abnormal sensory or motor signs, symptoms consistent with neuropathy, and decreased tendon reflexes. The prevalence of neuropathy in this cohort was 34% (18%, 18-29 yr old, 58% greater than or equal to 30 yr old) with no difference by sex. By focusing on subjects greater than or equal to 18 yr old, all significant univariate variables (e.g., duration, glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1]) were analyzed in 3 multiple logistic regression models: all subjects greater than or equal to 18 yr old and separating the same subjects into two groups based on age (18-29 and greater than or equal to 30 yr). Duration, HbA1, smoking status, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were found to be associated with neuropathy in the models for the greater than or equal to 18-yr-old group and the greater than or equal to 30-yr-old group. In the 18- to 29-yr-old group, duration, HbA1, and hypertension status were found to be significantly associated with neuropathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent studies in humans indicate that autoantibodies to insulin and islets of Langerhans appear years before overt diabetes and identify a normoglycemic prediabetic state. To determine whether type I diabetes mellitus represents a generalized immunologic disorder, we studied the phenotypic characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocytes from all stages, i.e., prediabetic, new-onset diabetic, and long-term diabetic patients, with the anti-2H4 monoclonal antibody CD45R, which defines a human suppressor-inducer subset, and the anti-4B4 monoclonal antibody CDw29, which defines a human helper-inducer subset of peripheral blood lymphocytes. All 22 prediabetic patients had elevated T4+2H4+ (suppressor-inducer) cells and reciprocal depressed T4+4B4+ (helper-inducer) cells compared with healthy age-matched control subjects. In addition, the T4/T8 ratio in prediabetic patients was decreased compared with the age-matched control subjects. The abnormal T4+2H4+ and T4+4B4+ subsets were resolved in 20 new-onset and 15 long-term diabetic patients. Family studies showed that the changes in the 2H4 and 4B4 antigens were not part of an inherited polymorphic determinant, because these markers were normal in unaffected siblings and parents. Ten prediabetic patients were restudied greater than 1 yr after the original analysis and showed the persistence of the observed changes. This abnormal increase in suppressor-inducer cells and decrease in helper-inducer cells among islet and insulin antibody-positive prediabetic patients may be of help in understanding diabetes pathogenesis and may also be an early noninvasive screening tool for the detection of the prediabetic state.\r"

Residue-detection data, generated during the single passage of a bolus of 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin (125I-BSA) through the coronary vasculature, were used to estimate indices of vascular function, including the mean transit time of 125I-BSA, the fractional rate of intravascular clearance of 125I-BSA, and 125I-BSA permeation of coronary vessels. During reflow after ischemia in hearts from control rabbits, vascular resistance increased approximately three times that at baseline, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) increased 8-10 times, and maximum +dP/dt recovered 0.4 times baseline, whereas the fractional rate of washout of intravascular 125I-BSA decreased to less than one-half of baseline values (was prolonged 2-fold), and albumin permeation and mean-transit time were increased 3 and 5 times baseline, respectively. In hearts from diabetic rabbits, vascular resistance was similar to the control group before ischemia but increased only one-third as much during reflow after ischemia. Increases in LVEDP during reflow were approximately 50% lower than controls, and +dP/dt recovered approximately 2.5 times more than in control hearts. 125I-BSA permeation in diabetics was similar to controls before ischemia, but during reflow increased 6 times (approximately 2 times controls). Washout of intravascular 125I-BSA was prolonged approximately 20% versus baseline during 3 h of reflow in hearts from diabetic rabbits. Thus, ALX-D in the rabbit delayed ischemia-reperfusion injury to myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells while increasing vascular albumin permeation.\r"

  ".W": "Pima Indians have served as a model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Within this population, inherited insulin resistance is a primary determinant of abnormal glucose metabolism. The insulin receptor is regarded as a \"candidate gene\" that could potentially be defective in Pima Indians or other populations with NIDDM. To directly address the question of potential insulin-receptor genetic defects in Pima Indians, we isolated and sequenced insulin-receptor cDNA from two Pima Indians with NIDDM. Small amounts of lymphoblast RNA were used to generate first-strand cDNA, which was then amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this way, seven overlapping segments of insulin-receptor cDNA were obtained. With the exception of the alternatively spliced 36-base pair exon 11, which is not expressed in lymphoblasts, the complete coding region of the mature proreceptor was examined with a combination of direct sequencing and sequencing of subcloned PCR segments. The nucleotide sequence in both subjects was identical to previously published insulin-receptor cDNA sequences obtained from healthy subjects. These data indicate that abnormalities of insulin binding and receptor function that have been previously observed in vitro with fresh and cultured cells from Pima Indians may be consequences of the diabetic milieu and/or genetic abnormalities in molecules that interact with the insulin receptor.\r"

A convenience sample of 93 respondents was obtained. Analysis of the data showed that adaptation to the dominant culture, as measured in this study, is as good an independent predictor of high levels of physician office visitation as self-reported health status. In addition, it has a small but significant effect on perceived health. These results suggest that further exploration of the effect of cultural adaptation on health behaviors would be productive for clinicians and health resource managers.\r"

Interviews with adolescents and health care workers in rural and urban neighborhoods showed that many adolescents are unaware of certain important personal matters that affect their health; the same holds true for some of those who work with these young people. All too often physicians are not trained to deal with many of the problems they encounter with pregnant adolescents. Many of the problems and concerns associated with adolescent pregnancy which directly affect the medical well-being of the mother and baby are not considered traditional medical problems: family experiences, superstitions, folk beliefs, culturally sanctioned interests, eating and sleeping habits. For the physician to successfully care for the adolescent mother and her child, these important concerns must be understood and addressed.\r"

  ".W": "Early access to prenatal care is a major issue in the prevention of low birth weight. Therefore, the authors studied 107 indigent women seen consecutively for their initial visits at a public health department's prenatal clinic to ascertain factors associated with first trimester care. The questionnaire included items on individual health behaviors, attitudes toward medical care, perceived social support, depression, and demographics. Data were collected over 12 weeks by a clinic nurse, and all patients agreed to participate. Using logit estimated odds ratios (OR), none of the independent variables examined were associated with first trimester care for married women. For unmarried women first trimester care was related to finding the clinic by word of mouth (OR = 5.5, 95% CI, 1.2-22.9) and maternal depression (OR = 4.0, 95% CI, 1.1-15.3). Finding the prenatal clinic by word of mouth and maternal depression were still associated with first trimester care after controlling for maternal education and health attitudes. These data suggest that subsequent explanatory research should explore the association between informal social support of unmarried women and first trimester prenatal care.\r"

Furthermore, inclusion of previous and current photographs had a mediating effect on attitude formation and the formation of stereotypes. These results suggest that presenting social attractiveness information may be useful in countering negative perceptions of the elderly.\r"

Interviews with family physicians and psychologists revealed that physician visits before and after referrals, good communication between the physician and the psychologist, physician knowledge about psychotherapy, third-party insurance coverage, and a holistic approach to the patient were considered important components of a successful referral. Physicians believed that patients' income and psychologist experience were less important than did psychologists, but physicians felt that involving the family was more important than psychologists. Both groups generally agreed about specific problems and their relationships to a successful referral. This survey identified issues useful to providers attempting to care for patients with psychological problems by the referral process.\r"

It is futile to respond to this resistance by continued academic argument and pleading. Instead, primary care should turn its efforts toward questions of national health policy in the political realm. Ironically, academic success is more likely to result from new political initiatives than from new academic ones, as primary care shows its willingness to take on the difficult problems of care for the underserved in the face of cost constraints.\r"

Despite allocating an increasing proportion of our total national resources to the medical care enterprise, large segments of the population lack access to basic health services. We face a paradox where the rising investment in health services undermines our ability to deal with many of the fundamental causes of illness such as social disruption, poor educational systems, and poverty. Family medicine has a role to play in confronting this paradox. Family medicine is a discipline defined by its social role and must resist the temptation to become yet one more medical guild, profiting from rather than seeking to change the existing system. Specifically, we should periodically reevaluate the content of residency training, work collectively toward universal entitlement for health care, and resist reimbursement systems which create conflicts of interest between physician and patient. The family physician has both the opportunity and the responsibility to be the practical bridge between the public health and the curative medical system. By using this social role as an unwavering compass, family medicine can help transform an irrational and inequitable health care system.\r"

  ".W": "In an environment of strict fiscal control and continuing pressure to control costs, many CEOs are becoming actively involved in health planning at the local level. Most experts agree that regulators aren't likely to bring back certificate of need as the basis of a formalized planning system. But some regulators are taking a second look at direct fiscal controls that have helped contain costs in some eastern states. The specter of some form of regulation, coupled with mounting financial problems, is prompting health care executives to take a close look at what has worked in health planning and what has been a disaster. Moreover, some CEOs aren't waiting for the bureaucracy to inch along. They are working with other executives to sort out community needs and solve areawide health delivery problems.\r"

Eight normal men (mean age 30 years) were studied on two separate study days at least 1 week apart, 2.5 hours after taking, at random, either desipramine (125 mg p.o.) or placebo. Forearm vascular resistance was measured at rest and at the end of 6 minutes of LBNP at -40 mm Hg. This was done both before and 30 minutes after a 60-minute infusion of epinephrine (1.5 micrograms/min i.v.). From similar baselines, the forearm vasoconstrictor response to LBNP was significantly augmented 30 minutes after epinephrine on the placebo day (+17 +/- 4 vs. +12 +/- 3 resistance units, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) but not on the desipramine day (+14 +/- 2 vs. +16 +/- 3 resistance units). The heart rate response to LBNP was also greater after epinephrine on the placebo day (+20 +/- 3 vs. +16 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Mean arterial pressure was higher after epinephrine infusion on the placebo (p less than 0.01) but not on the desipramine day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This tenet was investigated by examining the Na(+)-H+ antiport in serially passed skin fibroblasts from blacks and whites. Na(+)-dependent stimulation of the Na(+)-H+ antiport by cellular acidification resulted in a greater maximal velocity (Vmax) (mean +/- SEM) of this transport system in quiescent fibroblasts from blacks than fibroblasts from whites; the Vmax for recovery from cellular pH (pHi) of 6.6 was 5.84 +/- 0.50 versus 4.39 +/- 0.34 mmol H+/l X 20 seconds for blacks and whites, respectively (p less than 0.05). Although the Na+ concentration producing 50% stimulation of the Na(+)-H+ antiport for blacks (35.1 +/- 5.7 mM) was greater than for whites (24.1 +/- 3.5 mM), this difference was not statistically significant. No racial differences were observed in the Hill coefficient (n, 1.35 +/- 0.21 for blacks and 1.46 +/- 0.28 for whites). Compared with whites, cells from blacks exhibited a greater response to cytoplasmic acidification over the range of pHi values 6.20-6.60, as exhibited by an augmented rate of recovery in the pHi. These differences were not due to different basal pHi values or cellular buffering capacities, which were similar for blacks and whites. Na(+)-H+ antiport activity was not correlated with family history of hypertension. Increased activity of the Na(+)-H+ antiport in fibroblasts from blacks was confirmed without cellular acidification by stimulating quiescent cells with 10% human serum. This study demonstrates innate racial differences in cellular membrane Na(+)-H+ antiport activity.\r"

  ".W": "Blood pressure and the rate of excretion of an oral salt load were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the Okamoto strain after exposure in utero and during suckling to a high salt (3% NaCl, wt/wt), low salt (0.1%), control salt (0.8%), or high potassium (2.2% KCl, wt/wt) [corrected] maternal diet. After weaning, all offspring were given a diet containing 0.8% NaCl. There were small but significant differences in growth rate among offspring groups over the 60 weeks of observation, with rats exposed to perinatal low salt and high salt diet being lighter than those given control or high potassium diet. There were positive, significant correlations between body weight and blood pressure in all dietary groups at 8 weeks of age but not 16 or 24 weeks. Rats exposed to perinatal low salt diet had significantly lower blood pressures than the other three groups, which had similar blood pressures. Low salt rats also exhibited an exaggerated natriuresis after a single, oral salt load (0.15 M saline, 1% body weight) compared with the other three diet groups, which were not different from each other. High potassium rats had a reduced kaliuresis and diuresis after the salt load when compared with the other three groups. At 60 weeks of age, rats that received perinatal low salt diet had significantly heavier adrenal glands when compared with the other groups, and the high potassium group had significantly elevated plasma renin concentrations. Thus, maternal electrolyte intake during the perinatal phase may alter body fluid homeostasis in genetically susceptible individuals at maturity.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to determine the role of prostanoids in a new model of mineralocorticoid-dependent hypertension induced by the subcutaneous infusion of aldosterone (1 micrograms/hr) to normal male Sprague-Dawley rats. This regimen caused a mild and gradual increase in systolic pressure over a period of 4 weeks (113 +/- 1 vs. 137 +/- 3 mm Hg) and was associated with an increase in the in vivo formation of prostaglandins I2 and E2 and of thromboxane A2 in the kidney. High sodium intake induced a fall in the urinary levels of prostaglandin E2 and a rise in the arterial pressure of control rats (126 +/- 1 vs. 113 +/- 1 mm Hg) but did not influence aldosterone-induced hypertension. Indomethacin (3.0 mg/kg/day) caused a profound inhibition of the in vivo synthesis of prostaglandin I2 and thromboxane A2 without modifying the renal production of prostaglandin E2. Although indomethacin exerted no effect on aldosterone-induced hypertension in rats fed a normal diet, it caused a further rise in systolic pressure in aldosterone-treated rats fed a high sodium diet (157 +/- 6 vs. 140 +/- 4 mm Hg). The results of this study in a model of aldosterone-induced mild hypertension in the rat indicate that 1) aldosterone exerts a stimulatory effect on the renal synthesis of prostanoid, particularly prostaglandin E2; 2) thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin I2 do not seem to play a role in aldosterone-induced hypertension under conditions of normal dietary salt intake, whereas the role of prostaglandin E2 is unclear; 3) there is enough sodium in a normal diet to allow for the maximal expression of the hypertensive effect of aldosterone; 4) prostaglandin I2 seems to play a significant role in modulating the cardiovascular impact of a high sodium diet in aldosterone-treated rats; and 5) the renal biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 is particularly resistant to the inhibitory effect of indomethacin in vivo.\r"

Treatment was initiated at 12 months of age, and the rats were studied at either 13 or 15 months of age (after 1 or 3 months of treatment). All rats were unilaterally nephrectomized. One group received deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) injections (30 mg/kg s.c.) biweekly and 1% NaCl drinking water (DOCA salt), and the other group was injected with the vehicle (sesame seed oil) and given tap water to drink (sham). During the first 4 weeks of DOCA-salt treatment, arterial pressure reached its peak and left ventricular enlargement was mainly due to increases of 47% in cardiocyte cross-sectional area in the middle layer of the left ventricular wall. The last 2 months were characterized by an accelerated endomyocardial growth. Because absolute left ventricular mass did not increase during the last 2 months of treatment, we conclude that cellular hypertrophy was accompanied by a focal loss of cardiocytes. Myocardial hydroxyproline concentration was initially elevated by 37% but normalized by the third month of treatment. Intracellularly, myofibril volume percent was not changed, but mitochondria volume percent declined (13% in the midmyocardium and 15% in the endomyocardium) and sarcoplasmic volume density increased by 25% and 39%, respectively, in these regions. Left ventricular hypertrophy was associated with enhanced peak cardiac and stroke indexes, measured during increased preload, after both 1 and 3 months of DOCA-salt treatment. Acceleration of flow, however, was depressed in the rats with left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In study 1, atria from E-12 WKY rat embryos grafted into anterior eye chambers of either SHR or WKY host rats achieved a larger size than did SHR grafts by 8 weeks in oculo (2.98 +/- 0.75 and 2.55 +/- 0.32 mm2 vs. 1.80 +/- 0.20 and 2.04 +/- 0.44 mm2). Beating rates did not differ between SHR and WKY rat atria implanted into SHR or WKY host rats. In study 2, ventricles from E-13 embryonic SHR and WKY rat hearts grew to similar size and weight when implanted into SHR or WKY host rats (e.g., SHR hearts, 1.81 +/- 0.32 vs. 1.74 +/- 0.33 mm2; WKY rat hearts, 1.75 +/- 0.29 vs. 2.29 +/- 0.32 mm2). Ventricle grafts from SHR embryos into SHR host rats beat more rapidly (165 +/- 19 beats/min) during weekly measurements than either WKY rat ventricles (92 +/- 9 beats/min in SHR hosts and 99 +/- 9 beats/min in WKY host rats) or SHR ventricles grafted into WKY host rats (109 +/- 7 beats/min, p less than 0.001). In study 3, atria from E-13 SHR and WKY rat embryos were grafted into sympathectomized and intact eye chambers of SHR or WKY host rats. Sympathectomy of the eye chamber compromised growth of grafts into WKY host rats (1.54 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.90 +/- 0.14 mm2) but not SHR hosts (1.54 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.73 +/- 0.24 mm2). Grafts into sympathectomized eye chambers of WKY host rats beat more slowly than grafts into eye chambers with sympathetic innervation intact (282 +/- 14 vs. 202 +/- 14 beats/min); sympathectomy did not alter beating rate of grafts in SHR hosts (266 +/- 14 vs. 255 +/- 18 beats/min). These results suggest that the growth and beating rate of SHR atrial grafts may be less sensitive to sympathetic innervation than WKY rat atrial grafts. In these studies, SHR grafts did not grow larger than WKY heart grafts and did not show an increased intrinsic beating rate, suggesting that the cardiac hypertrophy and increased intrinsic beating rate observed in intact SHR are unlikely to result from direct genetic programming.\r"

Before and after the erythropoietin therapy M-mode and pulsed Doppler echocardiographic studies, measurements of plasma volume by radioiodinated human serum albumin, and measurements of atrial natriuretic factor were carried out. After 6 weeks of erythropoietin therapy, hematocrit increased from 20.0 to 33.0%. Cardiac output, stroke volume, left ventricular diastolic dimensions, and left ventricular wall stress were all significantly decreased. Total peripheral resistance, interventricular septal thickness, and left ventricular posterior wall thickness were significantly increased. In Doppler echocardiographic studies, the mean velocity of aortic ejection flow and left ventricular acceleration time were decreased. The blood volume derived from plasma volume and hematocrit was not changed, whereas plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration was significantly decreased. These data suggest that recombinant human erythropoietin administration suppressed the hyperdynamic cardiac state that was required to maintain oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues in severe uremic anemia.\r"

There were 18 women and 27 men in each group, ranging from 30 to 73 years of age. Results of essential hypertensive patients differed in several ways from those of normotensive subjects. In essential hypertensive patients, maximal 5HT uptake velocity (Vmax) decreased with increasing blood pressure and age and was reduced the most in older men. Vmax was positively related to the EC50 of 5HT for inducing a shape change reaction. In essential hypertensive patients, both Vmax of 5HT uptake and the EC50 of 5HT for shape change showed positive correlations with the 5HT content in platelets; the former relation was different between the essential hypertensive and normotensive groups (F = 5.53; p = 0.02). These results indicate reduced uptake of 5HT by blood platelets and suggest enhanced 5HT plasma concentrations in local areas, especially vascular lesions in essential hypertensive patients. Increased periplatelet concentrations of 5HT may lead to preactivation of platelets and possibly stimulation of vascular smooth muscle via their 5HT2-receptors. These changes are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of increased thromboembolic complications in essential hypertensive patients, particularly in older men.\r"

Microinjections of angiotensin II (0.2-20 pmol) into histologically verified sites in the caudal ventrolateral medulla of anesthetized baroreceptor-denervated rabbits produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and renal sympathetic nerve activity, whereas microinjection of [Sar1Thr8]angiotensin II (40 pmol) produced increases in these variables. In the rostral ventrolateral medulla, angiotensin II (0.02-20 pmol) elicited a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure, iliac vascular resistance, and renal sympathetic nerve activity, whereas [Sar1Thr8]angiotensin II (40 pmol) produced decreases in these variables. The effects on heart rate elicited by either compound in the rostral or caudal ventrolateral medulla were small but were in the same direction as the other cardiovascular variables. In contrast, angiotensin II had no detectable effect on sympathoexcitatory neurons within the rostral dorsomedial medulla, a region that lacks angiotensin II receptor binding sites. The results indicate that endogenous angiotensin II acts on specific receptors within the rostral and caudal parts of the ventrolateral medulla and has a tonic excitatory action on sympathoexcitatory and sympathoinhibitory neurons within these respective regions.\r"

  ".W": "Involvement of the brain renin-angiotensin system in baroreceptor reflex regulation was assessed by recording reflex heart rate and sympathetic nerve responses in normotensive rats that had been infused intracerebroventricularly with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril for 15 days. Reflex bradycardia and sympathetic nerve inhibition during pressor responses to phenylephrine were larger in rats with intracerebroventricularly infused enalapril than in control rats similarly infused either intracerebroventricularly with saline or intravenously with enalapril. In contrast, opposite reflex responses to sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension were mostly unaffected. Because depressor, bradycardic, and sympathoinhibitory responses to electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the left aortic depressor nerve were also enhanced, intracerebroventricularly infused enalapril must be affecting the baroreceptor reflex arc centrally. These results are compatible with the interpretation that intracerebroventricularly infused enalapril enhanced baroreceptor reflex sensitivity by reducing endogenous angiotensin II levels in the brain through converting enzyme inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "The role of endogenous vasopressin in cardiovascular homeostasis was examined using vasopressin-deficient rats (Brattleboro) (n = 194) and their parent strain, Long-Evans rats (n = 181). Mean arterial pressure (blood pressure) and heart rate were measured every 4 seconds with or without infusion of drug solution for 21 hours, and mean values and their standard deviations (lability) were calculated. Blood pressure in Brattleboro rats (116 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM) was significantly higher than that in Long-Evans rats (96 +/- 0.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), whereas heart rates (381 +/- 3.3 and 375 +/- 2.9 beats/min, respectively) were similar. The lability of blood pressure and heart rate in Brattleboro rats (9.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg and 42.3 +/- 0.7 beats/min) was also greater than that in Long-Evans rats (6.7 +/- 0.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001 and 38.4 +/- 0.8 beats/min, p less than 0.01, respectively). In Brattleboro rats, intravenous vasopressin (0.1 ng/kg/min or 0.6 ng/kg/min) did not affect blood pressure, although it did reduce heart rate and decreased lability of blood pressure and heart rate. Intracerebroventricular (central) infusion of vasopressin (2 pg/kg/min) in Brattleboro rats induced initial hypertension and tachycardia followed by long-lasting hypotension and bradycardia, whereas in Long-Evans rats it induced only hypertension and tachycardia. In both strains, central vasopressin dramatically decreased the lability of blood pressure and heart rate. Neither intravenous (0.2 ng/kg/min) nor central desmopressin (2 pg/kg/min or 0.2 ng/kg/min), a V2 renal receptor agonist, changed any of these parameters in Brattleboro rats, although both diminished urinary volume. Neither intravenous (50 ng/kg/min) nor central (3.3 pg/kg/min) d(CH2)5-Tyr(Me)-arginine vasopressin, a vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, modulated any of these parameters in Long-Evans rats. These results suggest that endogenous as well as exogenous vasopressin acts centrally as a cardiovascular inhibitor and stabilizer through a receptor mechanism other than V1 or V2 receptor mechanisms.\r"

Both experienced temporary pain relief and it was only after repeated presentations to the emergency department that their conditions--a subarachnoid hemorrhage and a subdural hematoma--were accurately diagnosed. Because of this, caution must be exercised before re-treating within a short period of time, a patient with recurrent headache. Strong consideration must be given to an alternate diagnosis and such a diagnosis should be actively sought should there be any suspicion of a non-migrainous cause for headache. It is only by doing so that we may avoid missing more serious and life-threatening conditions such as those with which our patients presented.\r"

The operation consisted of acromioplasty, resection of the coracoacromial ligament and subacromial bursa, and removal of osteophytes, when present, near the inferior aspect of the acromioclavicular joint. In the patients who had a partial or complete tear, minimum debridement of the rotator cuff also was performed. In group 1, eighty-six patients (eighty-nine shoulders) were available for review at a minimum follow-up to two years (average, 31.2 months). The preoperative ratings for pain, activities of daily living, work, and sports improved markedly in eighty-one patients postoperatively. The most common findings at operation were proliferative subacromial bursitis and an acromial protuberance. Two complications were recorded. Seven patients had a subsequent open operation on the shoulder. In group 2, the average follow-up was 28.9 months (range, twenty-four to forty-eight months). Of the forty patients, thirty-three had a major improvement in the ratings for pain, activities of daily living, work, and sports. One complication, transient palsy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, was noted. Two patients who had an unsatisfactory result had a second operation: one, open acromioplasty and the other, repair of the rotator cuff. In group 3, the average follow-up was 30.8 months (range, twenty-four to fifty-five months). There were fourteen satisfactory and eleven unsatisfactory results. Of the twenty-five patients, seven later had open repair of the rotator cuff, and six had a satisfactory result from that procedure. No complications were recorded. It was concluded that arthroscopic acromioplasty is effective in the treatment of isolated stage-II impingement and partial tears of the rotator cuff. Arthroscopic treatment of complete tears produced over-all results that were inferior to those of traditional open repair. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression cannot be supported as treatment for complete tears of the rotator cuff.\r"

No spring or wire traction is employed. The ages of the patients at operation ranged from twenty months to five years and ten months. The duration of follow-up ranged from three years to fourteen years and three months. In eleven of the fifteen patients who were available for follow-up, there was a moderate or dramatic improvement in appearance postoperatively. Preoperatively, the total abduction of the shoulder averaged 91 degrees (range, 60 to 120 degrees), and postoperatively, the abduction averaged 148 degrees. A radiographic geometric method was devised to quantitate lowering and derotation of the scapula. The lowering did not change appreciably with time. The original malrotation of the scapula was corrected initially but usually recurred after two years; however, this did not compromise the large increase in abduction postoperatively.\r"

The risk factors included a previous operation on the elbow, a previous infection in the region of the elbow, psychiatric illness, class-IV rheumatoid arthritis, drainage from the wound after operation, spontaneous drainage after ten days, and reoperation for any reason. Three modes of treatment were used for patients who had an established infection: debridement and salvage of the implant, resection arthroplasty, and arthrodesis. After early operative debridement and suppression of the infection with long-term antibiotic therapy, three patients were able to retain the prosthesis, with restoration of range of motion and function of the upper extremity. One prosthesis was reimplanted after a six-week course of intravenous administration of antibiotics.\r"

  ".W": "To study the relationships between the changes due to aging in lumbar intervertebral discs and the development of protrusion or prolapse, we carried out histological studies on operative specimens of thirty-one discs, of which twenty-two had been protruded and nine, prolapsed. The specimens were obtained during twenty-nine operations for herniation of a lumbar intervertebral disc in patients who were sixty years old or older. Changes in the anulus fibrosus were more extensive in the nine prolapsed discs than in the twenty-two protruded discs. Of the nine prolapsed discs, myxomatous degeneration, fibrosis, and swollen anular fibers were found in all nine, and cysts were seen in five. Of the twenty-two protruded discs, only five showed myxomatous degeneration; ten, fibrosis; one, a cyst; and sixteen, swollen fibers. For comparison, we also studied specimens that had been obtained at operation from twenty-one other patients, twenty to fifty-nine years old, who had a prolapsed disc. The anulus showed myxomatous degeneration in all twenty-one specimens, cysts in eight, and fibrosis in ten. In addition, we examined 368 autopsy specimens from people who had been between twenty-five and eighty-five years old at the time of death. In many of the subjects who had died in the sixth decade of life or later, we found that the orientation of the inner fiber bundles of the anulus fibrosus was reversed, so that they bulged inward. The reversal appeared to be the result of myxomatous degeneration of the middle fibers of the anulus, atrophy of the nucleus, and narrowing of the disc space. These histological findings suggest explanations for the predominance of protrusions of the nucleus pulposus in patients who are less than sixty years old and of prolapse of the anulus fibrosus in the few patients who are more than sixty years old who have herniation of an intervertebral disc.\r"

  ".W": "An objective evaluation for the assessment of patients who have persistent low-back pain and sciatica was tested in eighty-four patients who were operated on by one of us (D.M.S.). In this scoring system, there are four major categories for preoperative assessment: neurological signs, sciatic-tension signs, psychological factors, and imaging studies. When the preoperative scores of the eighty-four patients were correlated with the findings at operation, the three patients who had the lowest scores were the only ones in whom the operative findings were negative. As shown by statistical analysis, the score for imaging studies correlated best with the operative findings. In contrast, in the sixty-one patients who were followed sufficiently to determine the clinical outcome, the psychological score was the best predictor of the outcome of treatment. On the basis of these studies, we concluded that the use of this objective scoring system reduced the incidence of negative findings at exploration of the disc and improved the clinical result after elective discectomy. The higher the score was preoperatively, the more likely the patient was to have a good result after discectomy.\r"

  ".W": "In twenty-five patients, the Pavlik harness failed to obtain or maintain reduction in thirty of thirty-five congenital dislocations of the hip. All of the patients had met the clinical criteria for use of the harness in our institution: they were less than seven months old, the femoral head pointed to the triradiate cartilage on anteroposterior radiographs that were made with the child wearing the harness, and they had no evidence of neuromuscular disease or teratological dislocation. These patients were compared with seventy-one patients (eighty-one dislocations) who had also been treated with the Pavlik harness and in whom a stable reduction was obtained and maintained. Statistically significant risk factors for failure of the harness included an absent Ortolani sign at the initial evaluation, bilateral dislocation, and an age of more than seven weeks before treatment with the harness was begun. All thirty hips in which the harness failed to obtain or maintain reduction had a subsequent attempt at closed reduction after preliminary Bryant traction. Fifteen of these hips were successfully reduced closed, but two later redislocated and needed an open reduction. The remaining fifteen hips needed an open reduction, and two redislocated and needed a second open reduction.\r"

  ".U": "90154150\r", 
  ".W": "The results of total hip arthroplasty with the use of medial and superior bone-graft augmentation in thirty-nine hips (thirty-two patients) that had protrusio acetabuli were previously reported after two to eight years (mean, 4.7 years) of follow-up. We followed the surviving patients for 10.9 to 17.4 years (mean, 12.8 years). The average Harris hip-rating was 72 points--an average drop of 17 points since the previous report. The average was 64 points for patients who had rheumatoid arthritis and 83 points for those who had another diagnosis. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated definite, probable, and possible loosening in about 20, 10, and 60 per cent of the hips, respectively. Of the six hips that had definite loosening, four (10 per cent of the total series) had progression of the protrusion (acetabular migration); operative revision was performed on two of those four hips and on two other hips, in which progression had ceased. Hips that had progressive protrusion demonstrated superior migration more often than medial migration. The rates of loosening and revision were similar to those in hips that did not have protrusio acetabuli. We concluded that augmentation of total hip arthroplasty with bone-grafting is effective in arresting the progression of protrusio acetabuli in most hips (90 per cent in our series).\r"

The change in the distance of linear separation between each pair of osseous fiber-insertion sites was measured and was plotted against the angle of flexion of the knee as the knee was cycled through a 120-degree range of motion. Testing conditions likely to be present during intraoperative testing for isometry were used (anterior cruciate fibers transected, quadriceps relaxed, femur stabilized with the patient in the supine position and the leg freely dependent, and motion of the knee induced in neutral rotation by force applied at the level of the foot). In no instance did the insertion-site centers of any fiber-region exhibit isometric behavior (change in the distance of linear separation of 1.0 millimeter or less). The least deviations from isometry (range, 1.4 to 3.1 millimeters) were observed for the anteromedial sites, under conditions when the gravitational dependency of the lower leg was constrained. When the leg hung in a dependent manner during passive motion, the deviation from isometry of the anteromedial sites of insertion increased significantly (range, 2.8 to 5.6 millimeters). The central sites of insertion were generally less isometric than the anteromedial sites, and the posterior sites were the least isometric, regardless of testing conditions.\r"

The cases of four patients--two who had a primary total knee arthroplasty and two, a revision--are described, as well as the measures that are needed to correct the malalignment while avoiding the use of a highly constrained prosthesis. The principal measure that is necessary is the positioning of one of the attachments of one or both collateral ligaments on the femur in order to recreate the normal tightening action as full extension of the knee is achieved.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight total knee replacements (in thirty-five patients) that were complicated by infection were treated with a two-stage protocol for reimplantation. The clinical results in these knees (nine of which have been previously reported on) were evaluated at an average follow-up of four years (range, 2.5 to ten years). There was only one documented recurrence of infection with the original organism. Three patients in whom the immunological system was suppressed had a subsequent hematogenous infection with a different organism. According to the knee-rating system of The Hospital for Special Surgery, there were eleven excellent, thirteen good, six fair, and seven poor results. For one patient who had severe polyarticular rheumatoid arthritis, the result could not be rated. The results of this study suggested that the two-stage protocol for reimplantation, with a six-week interval of intravenous antibiotic therapy, is the procedure of choice for the treatment of an infection around a total knee arthroplasty. A patient who has polyarticular rheumatoid arthritis and in whom the immunological system is suppressed may not be an ideal candidate for the protocol. Gram-negative bacterial infection may be treated with this protocol, provided the organism is sensitive to relatively non-toxic antibiotic medication.\r"
