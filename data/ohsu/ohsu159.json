This particular group, remarkably resistant to outside input, would seem the most likely audience for programs dealing with asthma self-care. We have postulated 4 problem areas for this group that may be important in patients who have severe or refractory disease. These problems involve physiology, noncompliance with the medical regimen, stress, and depression and suicide. Each problem requires a specific intervention strategy and should be amenable to treatment in a comprehensive management plan.\r"

  ".U": "87301224\r", 
  ".W": "The estrogen receptor (ER) content of 31 surgically removed breast tumors (26 duct carcinomas, one lobular carcinoma, one papillary carcinoma, one colloid carcinoma, one duct carcinoma in situ, and one atypical fibroadenoma) was determined by a commercially available immunocytochemical method (Abbott Laboratories, ER-ICA) on cytologic material obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of surgical specimens. Immunocytochemical staining of cells by a peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique was evaluated on the basis of the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of staining. An immuno-staining score for cytologic (IS-CYTO) and histologic (IS-HISTO) material was defined and a threshold of positivity determined to facilitate the semi-quantitation of results and the comparison of cases. The results of immunostaining of cytologic material were compared with the evaluation of ER in corresponding tissue samples as determined by the radioligand binding assay using the dextran-coated charcoal procedure (ER-DCC) and by ER-ICA using cryostat sections of frozen tissue. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of a positive test, and test efficiency of ER-ICA in cytologic material as compared to ER-DCC was 96%, 83%, 96% and 93%, respectively. The IS-CYTO was significantly correlated with the IS-HISTO in corresponding histologic material (r = 0.72, P less than 0.001). In conclusion, the combination of ER-ICA with FNAB represents a useful new technique for the evaluation of ER which may be applied to small primary tumors, tumor recurrences, and metastases.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 185 eligible patients with advanced inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomized into two groups; the cisplatin, methotrexate, bleomycin, and vincristine (CABO) group received cisplatin (50 mg/m2; day 4), methotrexate (40 mg/m2; days 1, 15), bleomycin (10 mg; days 1, 8, and 15), and vincristine (2 mg; days 1, 8, and 15) and the ABO group received methotrexate, bleomycin and vincristine in the same doses on days 1, 8, and 15. After three courses, patients in both arms received weekly methotrexate as maintenance therapy; those 34 patients with previously untreated locoregional disease went off the study because of subsequent locoregional treatment in form of radiotherapy +/- surgery. The complete response rate was 16% in patients receiving CABO, compared with 5% among patients given ABO. The corresponding overall response rates were 50% and 28%, respectively (P = 0.003). Among patients with recurrent or metastatic disease, progression was delayed in patients receiving CABO (median, 18 weeks) compared to those receiving ABO (median, 14 weeks) (P = 0.07), but there was no difference in survival time. Myelosuppression consisted mostly of leukopenia, which was seen in 67% of the CABO patients versus 47% in the other arm. Myelosuppression-associated infection and hemorrhage led to death in two patients in the CABO treatment group and six patients in the ABO treatment group. Nausea and vomiting, mostly of grades 1 or 2, occurred in 93% of the patients given CABO and 44% of those receiving ABO. Other toxic effects--neuropathy, alopecia, stomatitis, constipation, fever/chills, diarrhea, cutaneous alterations, and renal impairment--occurred equally in the two treatment groups. This study underlines the role of cisplatin in head and neck cancer, although no impact on survival could be demonstrated. It also supports indirectly the superiority of combination chemotherapy over single-agent treatment for this disease.\r"

Thirty patients were treated with three cycles of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by reendoscopy and biopsy. Twelve patients achieved a complete pathologic response at the primary and received radiation (interstitial and/or external beam) only. The remainder underwent surgical resection and postoperative radiation. At 2 years, the relapse-free survival was 52%, and the survival was 53% for the entire group. For the 12 complete responders who had surgery eliminated, the relapse-free survival was 60%, and the survival was 70%. This pilot study suggests that for patients with resectable disease who achieve a complete pathologic response to induction chemotherapy at their primary, it is feasible to omit surgery and treat with primary radiation without compromise in survival. This approach warrants further study in a randomized trial.\r"

  ".W": "While hormone receptor values are extremely valuable in breast cancer management, many variables leading to falsely negative receptor results should be considered before clinical decision making in the setting of metastatic disease. At the Papanicolaou Comprehensive Cancer Center in Miami, Florida 271 patients with metastatic breast cancer received tamoxifen over a 4-year period. Only 40 of the 204 patients (19.6%) with available estrogen receptor assay information had pretreatment receptor values classically considered receptor-poor. While four patients had inevaluable tamoxifen trials and 12 patients had \"compassionate\" use in end-stage situations, 24 patients received tamoxifen therapy in the face of receptor-poor values because of clinical or histopathological correlates suggesting the possibility of false negative assay results. Six of 36 evaluable patients (16.6%), including those treated on \"compassionate grounds,\" responded to tamoxifen, while 6 of 24 more highly selected patients (25%) responded. Response durations in these six patients were 11, 12, 28, 28+, 49, and 51 months, respectively; two of these six also had significant, objective tamoxifen withdrawal responses of 9 and 14 months. Based on these results, it is urged that receptor values are studied and integrated with classical clinical and histopathologic variables before making a clinical decision so that patients with receptor-poor assay results are not prematurely labeled hormonally unresponsive.\r"

  ".W": "This article reports on a new approach to hepatic arterial chemoembolization therapy using ethiodized oil (Lipiodol, Ultra Fluide), cisplatin, and gelatin sponge (Gelfoam, Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The anticancer effects of this therapy on 20 patients who underwent subsequent hepatic resection were evaluated mainly by histologic examination. All main tumors were reduced in size following this therapy. It is notable that in 65% of the patients the tumor size was reduced to less than 50% of that before therapy. All the values of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the patients who exhibited pretreatment levels exceeding 100 ng/ml dropped by more than 50%, and in 55% of them it fell below 20 ng/ml. The concentration of platinum in the tumor tissue was significantly higher than that in the nontumorous tissue. In 15 of 20 patients (75%), the main nodules were completely necrotic. Thirteen of the patients had daughter nodules and/or small intrahepatic metastases (Group A); nine had tumor emboli in the portal (hepatic) vein (Group B); 17 had intracapsular invasions (Group C); and ten had extracapsular invasions (Group D). The ratios of patients with completely necrotic cancer cells in Group A were nine of 13 (69%); in Group B, seven of nine (78%), in Group C, 11/17 (65%); and in Group D, four of 10 (40%). In eight of the 20 patients (40%) no viable cancer cells were recognized at any foci. Lesions other than those with extracapsular invasion could be considerably eliminated with this form of therapy. It is expected that this method will become the therapy of choice not only for palliative treatment but also for preoperative treatment.\r"

Fifteen of the clinical and pathological variables studied, including patient age and tumor size, had no significant relationship to the outcome of this study. Four histologic features, all related to the degree of tumor extension within the \"tumor-kidney unit\" proved to be significantly associated with relapse. These were (1) invasion of the tumor capsule, (2) presence of an \"inflammatory pseudocapsule,\" (3) renal sinus invasion, and (4) tumor in intrarenal vessels. One or more of these features was present in 100% of relapsed cases (excluding one for which two variables were unevaluable), but occurred in only 46% of controls (P less than 0.0002). Therefore, no relapses occurred in the NWTS-3 when all four variables were negative. This result was confirmed by a review of all Stage I cases in the NWTS-1 who had relapsed and who were treated by single-agent chemotherapy. Again, no relapses occurred when all four factors were negative. These results demonstrate the feasibility of \"microsubstaging\" and could serve as a basis for future refinements of therapy for Stage I favorable histology Wilms' tumor.\r"

Here the authors report the efficacy of specific active TAA immunotherapy when the protocol is adhered to strictly, where the induction of cell-mediated immunity to TAA indicated a successful adherence to the protocol rather than the strategic result when centers from the third trial with major violations are included. The authors repeat here a summary of each of the three separate trials, each of the three trials having been reported elsewhere in their entirety, so that these total results may be compared to the present analysis. The survival experiences of a total of 234 lung cancer Stage I and Stage II patients, including all violations, from centers in northern New York, northern New Jersey, western Pennsylvania and eastern Canada show a statistically valid (P = 0.0002) 5-year survival difference between the control groups (receiving adjuvant alone or no treatment) at 49% survival and the specific active immunotherapy groups at 69% survival. The best promise of specific active immunotherapy alone in an adjunctive treatment setting is with early stage lung cancer. In addition to tests which monitor the effect of TAA immunotherapy induction of long-lasting cell-mediated immunity, tests (monoclonal antibody-derived epitope enzyme immunoassays) were developed to monitor specific, early antibody rises in the bloodstream (circulating humoral immunity).\r"

There were 11 Grade I papillomas, 14 Grade II TA, 18 Grade II-III TIS, 19 Grade II-III T1, and eight Grade II-III T2 carcinomas. One to five VUCs per patient (mean, 2.63) were obtained within the 24 hours preceding biopsy. At endoscopy a bladder wash specimen was obtained and divided for cytologic and flow cytometric examinations. For all tumor categories combined, the sensitivity for one, two, and three voided cytology examinations per patient was 41%, 41%, and 60%, respectively. The sensitivity of a single BWC was 61%, of a single BWFCM, 83%. Thus, one BWFCM is more sensitive than three VUC (binomial test; P = 0.006); one BWC is more sensitive than two VUC (P = 0.01); and one BWFCM is more sensitive than one BWC (P = 0.003). These findings remain significant when papillomas are excluded from the analysis (P less than or equal to 0.03) and when papillomas and T2 tumors are jointly excluded (P less than or equal to 0.02). Only four of 70 patients (6%) had their cancers detected by VUC and/or BWC rather than BWFCM. In summary, irrigation cytology specimens are more sensitive than voided urinary cytology, and bladder wash flow cytometry is more sensitive than either in diagnosing bladder cancer. Flow cytometry is more sensitive because of the better sampling of bladder irrigation compared with voided urine and because of the measurement technique itself.\r"

Of the well-described cases of PCN, approximately 95% have occurred in women between the ages of 12 and 35, suggesting a role for hormonal factors in the pathogenesis of this tumor. Consequently, tumor tissue from one patient was assayed for estrogen and progesterone receptors: significant levels of high-affinity receptors were demonstrated for both hormones. Assays for the same receptors in five normal pancreases were negative. This constitutes the first reported measurement of these receptors in the PCN; the results indicate that the PCN may be another hormone-sensitive tumor.\r"

Using the technique of allografting neonatal lung tissue into the cheek pouch of normal hamsters, the microvessels of the lung, pulmonary arterioles, and venules could be visualized and manipulated by direct in vivo microscopy. The microvessels of the lung were studied 7-10 days after allografting by anesthetizing the hamster with pentobarbital (6.0 mg/100 g body weight i.p.) and then preparing the lung tissue for observation. The tissue was suffused with a Ringer's bicarbonate solution bubbled with a normal (20% O2-5% CO2-75% N2) or a low (95% N2-5% CO2) oxygen mixture. After equilibration, a pulmonary arteriole or venule was selected for observation, and the vessel geometry was recorded. Then, a micropipette containing either AI or AII was positioned alongside the vessel, and the agent was delivered continuously for 2 minutes. Lumen diameter was recorded continually for 8-10 minutes. This procedure was repeated until both angiotensins were tested on pulmonary arterioles and venules under conditions of a normal and low oxygen environment. This protocol was repeated on cheek pouch microvessels that did not contain pulmonary allografts. Both AI and AII produced rapid decreases in the lumen diameters of all microvessels tested. This vasoconstriction was greater for AII, and the oxygen environment did not alter the response. Conversion of AI to AII was not altered by the oxygen environment, and the relative conversion was similar in the microvessels of the lung and cheek pouch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There is little evidence pertaining to putative changes in myosin phenotype during cardiac embryogenesis or if such changes could play a role in modulating the contractile characteristics of the developing heart. We examined isomyosin expression during cardiogenesis in the chick by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies to adult ventricular and atrial myosin heavy chains. Antibody specificity was characterized in the adult on the basis of immunofluorescence localization, ELISA, and protein blot immunoassay. Results show that the early embryonic chick heart has a different myosin phenotype than the later embryonic or adult heart. Both the embryonic ventricular and atrial myocardia initially expressed a myosin heavy chain that was recognized by antibody specific (in the adult) for ventricular myosin heavy chain. The ventricles remained reactive throughout life with the ventricular antibody, but reactivity of the atrial myocardium was confined to the initial 6 days of embryonic development. On the other hand, reactivity of the embryonic heart with multiple antibodies specific (in the adult) for atrial myosin was confined to the atrial myocardium throughout development. Thus, the distribution of myosin isoforms became similar to that of the adult myocardium by the time the embryonic heart achieved a 4-chambered configuration at 6 days in ovo.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cells (ECs) were isolated from bovine pulmonary artery and maintained in long-term culture. On reaching confluency, ECs formed a characteristic \"cobblestone\" monolayer. One hour after addition of 1 nM platelet-activating factor (PAF) to the growth medium, ECs underwent dramatic changes in shape from their normal polygonal morphology to more elongated spindle-shaped forms. More pronounced effects were evident in the presence of 0.1 nM phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), a potent activator of C kinase. It was found that at concentrations from 10(-11)-10(-7) M, PAF stimulates the phosphoinositide turnover in EC. The half-maximal activation in the release of inositol phosphates was at 10(-9) M. This finding suggested that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and activation of protein kinase C were involved in the mechanism of action of PAF on EC. The metabolic responses of EC were evaluated by measuring the activity of beta-adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase (AC) in a crude membrane fraction and by assay of prostacyclin and thromboxane released by cultured EC. AC from control membranes was activated by isoproterenol in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 30 nM) from 0.8-5.5 pmol cAMP/min/mg protein. If the membranes were isolated after preincubation of ECs with 1 nM PAF or 0.1 nM PMA, the AC activity was decreased by 70 and 90%, respectively; in both cases, affinity for isoproterenol was lowered threefold (EC50 = 100 nM). Our data suggest that PAF interaction with EC leads to an apparent beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization that probably acts via a phosphorylation mechanism involving C kinase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Furthermore, the risk function is continuous from the highest to the lowest serum cholesterol levels studied. These findings confirm the lipid hypothesis and indicate that lowering serum cholesterol reduces CHD risk. The understanding and control of CHD requires a dual approach: (1) identification and treatment of high-risk individuals, and (2) modification of environmental and behavioral determinants to achieve more favorable distributions of serum cholesterol in populations.\r"

During sustained therapy there was attenuation of the hemodynamic effects at rest, and treadmill exercise time to the onset of angina and to the development of moderate angina was increased 1 hr after dosing; no effect was apparent at 3 hr. During this state of nitrate tolerance, patients were treated with an infusion of normal saline or 100 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine and exercise testing was repeated. N-Acetylcysteine did not change the hemodynamic findings at rest or during exercise and there was no improvement in exercise tolerance.

Cross-correlation analysis (CCA) performed by computer was used to compare beat-to-beat variability in ST-T morphology of the S-ECG during different stages of PTCA. CCA was also applied to the signal-averaged high-frequency QRS (SA-HFQ). All patients developed angina during balloon inflation, accompanied by transient marked ST-T changes in IC-ECG in 10 of 11 patients (90%). Visual inspection of S-ECG revealed transient ST-T changes in only 6 of 11 (54%). In contrast, CCA of the S-ECG revealed transient ST-T changes in 9 of 11 (82%). Analysis of SA-HFQ revealed that balloon inflation was associated with a marked reduction in the calculated root-mean-square (RMS) voltage for such signals (2.31 +/- 1.04 microV) as compared with RMS values before (3.27 +/- 1.12 microV, p less than .05) PTCA or after conclusion of PTCA (3.79 +/- 1.39 microV, p less than .01). Balloon inflation was also accompanied by changes in waveform morphology of the SA-HFQ, including the development of new or more prominent time zones of reduced amplitude in 10 of 11 individuals (90%). Such zones may represent slow conduction in regions of the heart rendered ischemic during PTCA. CCA of the S-ECG and of SA-HFQ appears to detect evidence of transient ischemia with greater sensitivity than simple visual inspection of S-ECG, and may therefore prove to be of use in the evaluation of patients with chest pain of uncertain origin.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was undertaken to study the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade with timolol on infarct size and on the incidence of late ventricular tachycardia in patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than 6 hr of evolution. Patients were assigned randomly either to a placebo-treated group (98 patients) or to a timolol-treated group (102 patients). The patients were treated with 5.5 mg iv timolol (or matched placebo) as a bolus divided into four doses during the first 2 hr followed by 10 mg orally twice daily for 1 month. Cumulative total creatine kinase (CK) release, which reflects the amount of myocardial necrosis was 1677 +/- 132 IU/liter in the placebo group (n = 83) and 1274 +/- 73 IU/liter in the timolol group (n = 81, p less than .01), a 24% reduction. Cumulative release of CK-MB was 138 +/- 8 IU/liter in the placebo group and 106 +/- 8 IU/liter in the timolol group (p less than .01), a 23% reduction. Twenty-four hour Holter electrocardiograms were obtained on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after the onset of the acute myocardial infarction in 80 patients in the placebo group and 82 patients in the timolol group. The incidence of ventricular tachycardia was lower in the timolol than in the placebo group (7 vs 16 patients, p = .05). We conclude that early administration of intravenous timolol followed by oral treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size as assessed by CK and CK-MB serum activity, and decreases the occurrence of late ventricular tachycardia.\r"

In patients with multiple defects in the anulus, circumferential reconstruction of the mitral ring with pericardium was performed. In cases in which abscesses involved the central fibrous body, pericardium was used to reconstruct both the mitral anulus and the aortic root. Eight patients survived and have remained well for a mean of 8 months. There has been no prosthetic or patch dehiscence. All patients experienced substantial functional improvement. This experience indicates that the disrupted mitral anulus can be successfully reconstructed with autologous pericardium that is sutured directly to the endocardium of the left ventricle.\r"

OKT3-induced in vitro proliferation of simultaneously isolated lymphocytes was determined by H3-thymidine incorporation. T cell subpopulations were enumerated using a peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Mean Cy blood level reached its peak (Cmax = 1,466 +/- 186 ng/ml) at 4 to 6 hours, the elimination half life (t1/2) measured 31 +/- 7.2 hours. The T4/T8 cell ratio did not change during the study, the total numbers of T3, T4 and T8 positive lymphocytes showed well known circadian variations without an apparent influence of Cy. There was a strong relationship between Cy blood levels and the inhibition of in vitro lymphocyte proliferation (y = 21.1 -0.007x, r = -0.91, p less than 0.001). With decreasing Cy blood concentrations the proliferative potency of lymphocytes was restored without delay in time. In conclusion circulating T cell subpopulations are not influenced by a single dose of Cy, the strong correlation between drug levels and the inhibition of lymphoproliferation suggest that RIA derived Cy blood concentrations are a valuable tool for estimating immunosuppression.\r"

In 1982, the National Center for Health Statistics showed that firearms killed more than 33,000 individuals: 1,756 unintentionally, 16,573 by suicide, 13,841 by homicide, 376 by legal action, and 540 of undetermined intent. In terms of the total number of years of life lost, trauma in general contributed more years than heart disease and cancer combined for the year 1975. The southern regions of the United States tend to have higher firearm-related death rates than other regions of the country. Data collected within Arkansas are consistent with this trend. Handguns are the most frequently used firearms in fatal injuries. Unfortunately, data on nonfatal injuries are lacking. The emotional and economic costs of firearm-related death and injury are staggering. The estimated daily cost of hospitalization is $2100, and the average length of hospitalization is 10 days. The emotional impact of a gun-related injury or death will be felt immediately by 950,000 people per year. The economic loss resulting from \"premature\" deaths due to firearms is estimated to be nearly $4 billion annually. Unfortunately, the firearm is so ingrained in the American experience that one must conclude gunshot injuries and fatalities are simply part of the cost of living in America today.\r"

Major progress has been made in reducing these losses through improved highway design, improved laws, adjudication of laws controlling the drunk driver, and the advent of vehicle safety design standards. A federal law enacted in 1966 established the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Motor vehicles, particularly passenger cars, now provide effective protection for occupants because of vehicle safety design features required by the FMVSS. Safety belts are the single most effective safety device available and are required equipment in virtually all motor vehicles sold in the United States. Passive protection for nonusers of safety belts is rapidly improving with the availability of air bags and automatic belt systems, improved windshields, steering wheels, dashboards, and seats, and other vehicle crashworthiness features. Motorcyclists, bicyclists, and pedestrians are also provided with improved protection because of the FMVSS.\r"

Effective preventive measures include the reduction of road trauma and smoking, improved vehicle seating, the control of vehicle vibrations, careful worker selection, job redesign, improved physical fitness, and the proper use of the spine in the home, at school, at work, and in sports. Frymoyer includes these and other measures in his tips to prevent LBP. Medical and paramedical professionals must be sure their investigations and treatments do not contribute to making the disorder chronic and more complex. The inappropriate use and interpretation of spinal investigations and the overzealous use of surgical procedures certainly add to the problem. An agreement on an acceptable \"glossary\" of lumbar terms and clinical syndromes is needed together with a new research emphasis on prevention and a continuation of research efforts in epidemiology, etiology, and management of LBP. Effective public education is vital, so that everyone is aware of the causes and methods of prevention of LBP. Discussion on the \"20th-century epidemic of LBP\" may be concluded on an optimistic note by citing White, who considers most LBP to be preventable and controllable with simple measures, reinforcable through public education, which can do for LBP what has been done in the field of dental hygiene.\r"

Prevention is thus the preferred approach. To initiate a prevention program would require identification of those at greatest risk. Usually, small, thin, white or Asian women who have had an early menopause (or oophorectomy) can be considered most at risk. Other factors may include low calcium intake, inactivity, alcohol and cigarette consumption, and nulliparity. For those clinically thought to be at greatest risk, bone mass measurements may be used to more clearly define the population for whom preventive therapy would be indicated. Prevention consists of dietary and lifestyle alterations, primarily increases in calcium intake and exercise, and the judicious use of estrogens. Estrogen therapy remains the single most effective method for prevention of bone loss.\r"

Effective treatment of osteoarthrosis is generally mechanical. In many cases, the progression of the condition can be halted with appropriate intervention.\r"

  ".W": "The focus of medicine has increasingly turned toward prevention rather than treatment of disease. In the absence of the ability to prevent the occurrence of scoliosis, the focus of attention should be on early identification in order to prevent complications brought on by the disease. Scoliosis detection through screening of school children is a technique that has been popularized over the last three decades. The screening technique can be performed by trained personnel. Though the initial result of these screenings was over-diagnosis, the program has been shown to be cost-effective when the screeners are well-trained and appropriate referrals are made to minimize the lack of specificity. The use of the scoliometer to make a quantitative determination of the degree of truncal rotation has reduced the number of inappropriate referrals. The complications of scoliosis itself include pulmonary compromise, pain, and deformity; these are best prevented by early detection and early treatment. When scoliosis is treated late and larger curves are present, more involved and complication-ridden procedures are required. School children screening programs promote a better understanding and heightened awareness of this disease and acceptance of the treatment methods by the public.\r"

Although the abduction tests of Ortolani and Barlow are the standard methods of detection in the neonate, their value and their use in screening programs have been overemphasized. There is no evidence that the use of these tests in screening programs applied to large populations can consistently reduce the late sequelae of CDH. This overemphasis on neonatal screening results in a false sense of security with resultant lack of continued vigilance throughout the period of infancy.\r"

All three active treatments (cetirizine, 10 mg, cetirizine, 20 mg, and hydroxyzine) produced an equivalent suppression of skin wheal response to histamine that was significantly greater than placebo (P less than 0.01). Hydroxyzine produced a significant change compared with placebo in all three CNS parameters. Neither cetirizine, 10 mg, nor cetirizine, 20 mg, produced any significant change in CNS parameters. Both the intensity and time course of CNS effects were related significantly (P less than 0.05) to hydroxyzine concentrations.

We studied 10 normal subjects and nine patients with renal insufficiency, examining the effects of the first 500 mg dose of etodolac as well as 4 days of b.i.d. administration. In both groups, etodolac transiently decreased fractional excretions of sodium and chloride and urinary prostaglandin E2. In patients, etodolac also transiently decreased inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearances and urinary 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. Chronic administration caused no changes in renal function in either group. In summary, in this relatively small group of patients, high-dose etodolac caused only transient, fully reversible effects on renal function, the cumulative effect of which was negligible.\r"

The rate constant/min (K) for Xe blood uptake (KXeb) was derived, and when subtracted from K for XeW (KXeW) gave K for removal of Xe by CV (KXecv). Pig XeW were single exponentials with mean KXew = 0.25/min during IPPV and 0.12/min with HFO. In pigs, mean K of XeW was no different from KXeb so that all XeW occurred by blood uptake and none by CV. XeW in dogs had two exponentials. Dogs had over 11 times greater mean KXeW than pigs during IPPV and over 24 times greater during HFO. In dogs, on average, 79% (IPPV) and 87% (HFO) of XeW occurred by CV. CV is a means of gas exchange during HFO and IPPV in dogs but not in pigs.\r"

On scanning electron microscopy, all catheters were found to be covered by a biofilm, with bacteria visible on 50 percent of them. Cultures of specimens from 40 percent of the catheters grew skin organisms (Staphylococcus warneri, Diphtheroid), anaerobes (Propionibacterium), and other potential pathogens (Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae). Combination of the two techniques produced a bacterial detection rate of 75 percent. This study demonstrates that the presence of biofilm with bacterial adherence is common on right heart flow-directed catheters.

Doses of M and P were given in mumoles and bronchial responses to both agents were expressed as the provocative dose that induced a 20 percent fall in FEV1 (PD20 FEV1). In 16 asthmatic patients, there was no correlation between the PD20 of the two agents. Mean PD20 M (+/- SD in log scale) was approximately nine times lower than mean PD20 P (0.64 +/- 0.96 and 5.80 +/- 1.65, respectively). This difference was statistically significant (t = 4.58, p less than 0.001). In six asthmatic patients, the reproducibility of PD20 P was similar to that of M (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.969 and 0.957, respectively). The shape of the dose-response curves to P was different from that of M in five of nine asthmatic patients when all experimental points were analyzed by double-reciprocal plot. We noticed that even small doses of inhaled P may cause a severe bronchoconstriction. Therefore, special caution should be taken to increase P doses very gradually, when studying the dose-response curve. We demonstrated that P inhalation induced a measurable bronchoconstriction in subjects with mild to moderate hyperresponsiveness and it was reproducible. However, the bronchial sensitivity to P was lower than to M. Our findings suggest that P and M have different mechanisms of action.\r"

Thereafter, inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) was increased by 0.10 and airway pressure was increased by 10 cm H2O in random sequence. Cardiopulmonary function was reassessed after a five-minute stabilization period at each level of oxygen supplementation and airway pressure. An increase in FIO2 and the application of CPAP both produced significant elevation in arterial blood oxygen tension. Use of CPAP was consistently associated with a decrease in respiratory rate, blood pressure, and rate pressure product, which were not observed with a mere enhancement of oxygen therapy. The improvement in the measured cardiopulmonary variables associated with CPAP therapy cannot be achieved by reversing hypoxemia with supplemental oxygen only.\r"

Since a malignant growth was the main reason for performing a colostomy in patients followed at the centers of the authors' association (AISTOM), a correct follow-up approach for these patients is very important. A multicentric clinical trial was thus carried out to evaluate the efficacy of transstomal endoscopic exploration (TEE) of the residual colon, and data collection began on May 31, 1984. Nine hundred fifty-seven patients were submitted to TEE after curative abdominoperineal resection (Miles) for rectal cancer. The male-female ratio was 1.3; 89.6 percent of the patients were over 50 years of age. A family history of large-bowel cancer was present in 18 percent, and in 23 percent of the patients the cancer was associated with synchronous adenomas. Only 31 percent of the patients had colonoscopy or double-contrast barium enema x-ray beyond the neoplastic area before surgery. TEE was done in 96.8 percent of the patients; in 3.3 percent the examination was not possible, mainly for stenosis of the stoma (in 2.3 percent). In 82 percent of the patients a complete large-bowel exploration was possible: a new large, bowel cancer was found in 22 patients (2.2 percent) and an adenoma in 183 patients (19.1 percent). These results show that, because it is safe, practical, and effective, endoscopy plays an important role in the follow-up of ostomates.\r"

Possible explanations for this familial incidence are discussed. Abdominal tuberculosis is not so rare; 135 cases have recently been reported from the United States and Canada. This review dissipates four common misconceptions: abdominal tuberculosis is rare, tuberculosis is a stigmata of the poor, abdominal tuberculosis is always associated with active pulmonary tuberculosis, and chronic abdominal pathology is synonymous with regional enteritis. Since the description of regional enteritis, more and more cases of chronic intestinal pathology have been labeled \"regional enteritis.\" The fact that intestinal tuberculosis is rather uncommon should not automatically lead to the diagnosis of regional enteritis. The possibility that many cases of so-called regional enteritis may, in fact, be a stage or a variant of abdominal tuberculosis, is worth considering. Abdominal tuberculosis is not a relic of the past. It remains a real challenge to the diagnostic acumen and therapeutic skills of both the internist and the surgeon.\r"

Binding of [125I]STa to BB was specific; time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent; saturable; and partially reversible. Nonlabeled toxin competitively inhibited the binding of radioligand to BB in a dose-related manner. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of receptors with an apparent affinity constant of 8.7 +/- 1.5 X 10(8) l/mol. Binding was not affected by amino acids, sugars, and lectins. Proteolytic enzymes significantly decreased binding, although several did so by modifying the radioligand. Trypsin inhibited binding without modifying the radioligand thus supporting the proteinaceous nature of the receptor. Since the enrichment in binding activity in the BB over the homogenate was significantly lower than the enrichment in sucrase activity, we concluded that binding activity is probably associated with other membranous domains, but direct examination revealed no binding activity on basolateral membranes.\r"

An abnormal vagal response pattern has been found in the obese rat, but corresponding functional studies in obese man are nonexistent. The gastric acid secretion was therefore examined in 13 nondiabetic grossly obese patients (average body weight 120 kg) and compared to 16 age-matched controls of normal body weight. The gastric acid response to modified sham feeding was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced in obese patients, being on average 60% of the control output. The obese patients had a higher maximal gastric acid response to graded intravenous pentagastrin, 36.6 +/- 2.9 mmol/hr, compared to 27.1 +/- 2.4 mmol/hr in controls (P less than 0.05). In addition, the patients seemed to need less pentagastrin to reach a secretory plateau. Basal acid secretion rates were similar in obese and control groups. Plasma gastrin and blood glucose were not significantly different in obese patients and controls, but patients had significantly elevated plasma insulin levels. The change of plasma insulin during the sham-feeding procedure correlated with the magnitude of the secretory response in obese and control subjects. The reduced gastric acid response to vagal stimulation in the absence of impaired parietal cell function in obese patients is indicative of an association between massive obesity and altered vagal function in man.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the diabetic exchange lists or the glycemic index of foods better predicts postprandial responses to carbohydrate-containing foods eaten as part of a mixed meal, three test meals were developed and fed to 12 subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and 13 healthy subjects. Each test meal contained exactly the same exchanges (1 milk, 4 starch, 2 fruit, 2 meat, 3 fat, 1 vegetable). In one meal, foods of high glycemic index (GI) were used, in a second meal, foods of intermediate GI were used, and in a third meal foods of low GI were used. The total GIs of the meals were: high, 184; intermediate, 131; and low, 107, thus predicting responses to intermediate and low GI, which were 71 and 58%, respectively, of the responses to high GI. Although some of the observed differences in the glycemic responses to the test meals were statistically significant, primarily in healthy subjects, the differences were usually much less than predicted by the GIs of the meals. In NIDDM subjects, peak postprandial plasma glucose, plasma glucose area, plasma glucose area increment, and mean plasma glucose responses after intermediate and low GI were greater than 90% of the corresponding responses to high GI. In healthy subjects, only the plasma glucose area increment after the low-GI meal was close to the predicted response. High GI produced significantly greater insulin responses than low GI in healthy subjects. We conclude that the diabetic exchange lists more accurately predict postprandial responses to carbohydrate-containing foods eaten as part of a mixed meal than does the GI of foods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to test if the glycemic response to mixed meals can be altered by selecting carbohydrate-rich foods based on their glycemic potency. Consequently, three test meals were developed that should have yielded high-, intermediate-, and low-glycemic responses based on the published glycemic index of all the carbohydrate foods in the meals. The test meals were consumed by normal individuals and patients with NIDDM, and the resultant plasma glucose and insulin responses were determined. The results indicated that the plasma glucose responses after the meals did not vary as a function of their glycemic potency in either the normal or NIDDM subjects. There were no significant differences in the plasma insulin responses for either group. These results indicate that the plasma glucose response to mixed meals did not vary as a function of the calculated glycemic potencies. Therefore, the glycemic response to a mixed meal was not predicted on the basis of the published values of the glycemic index of the individual carbohydrate foods included in the meal.\r"

The dawn rise of plasma glucose was demonstrated in 17 (89.5%) of the 19 patients with mean +/- SE plasma glucose at 0300 h of 7.0 +/- 0.5 mM and at 0800 h of 8.4 +/- 0.6 (P less than .01).

The changes in IRI levels at any time from 0300 to 0800 h in groups 1 and 2 when considered separately were insignificant.

Insulin kinetics after administration of human soluble insulin (0.22 IU/kg) alone were compared with those after sequential administration of 1) human soluble insulin followed by human lente insulin and 2) human lente insulin followed by human soluble insulin. Total insulin dose in both sequences was 0.55 IU/kg, 40% of which was short-acting insulin. Plasma insulin levels were not significantly different at any time point between 0 and 240 min after soluble insulin compared with either combination. Although insulin levels were slightly but significantly lower at 30 and 105 min after lente followed by soluble insulin compared with soluble followed by lente insulin, these differences probably reflect chance occurrences. Glucose requirements were not significantly different after either of the three administrations. We therefore conclude that the unwanted retarding effect after mixing of human soluble insulin with human lente insulin in the syringe on the onset of action of the soluble insulin can be prevented by sequential subcutaneous injection of these insulins with two syringes through one needle.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the addition of phenoxybenzamine to a regular insulin preparation on the absorption of insulin and plasma glucose concentrations was investigated in five normal subjects. The addition of phenoxybenzamine (20 micrograms) to insulin (0.2 U/kg body wt) resulted in an acceleration of insulin absorption, with a higher and earlier peak insulin concentration at 45 min and higher insulin concentrations throughout the 180 min of investigation. With phenoxybenzamine, plasma glucose concentrations fell more rapidly; nadirs were lower and more rapidly achieved. Two subjects experienced hypoglycemic symptoms when phenoxybenzamine was added to insulin. It is concluded that the addition of phenoxybenzamine to subcutaneously injected insulin increases the bioavailability of insulin for at least 3 h, which leads to a greater fall in plasma glucose concentrations.\r"

In vitro a decrease of regular insulin was found immediately after mixture with semisynthetic lente insulin in proportions 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1. This was not found after mixture with human biosynthetic regular and NPH insulins. Free insulin and blood glucose were determined over 8 h after the morning injection of regular/lente (n = 9) or regular/NPH (n = 7) insulins in proportions used by the patients (approximately 1:2) mixed in one syringe or in separate syringes. Mixing the regular/lente preparations in one syringe immediately before injection resulted in a significant loss of the early rise in free insulin (P less than .01), with a tendency to a higher free insulin in the afternoon. A corresponding change in the blood glucose profile was seen. No changes were observed in free insulin or blood glucose after mixing regular and NPH preparations compared with separate injections. We conclude that mixing human semisynthetic regular and lente insulins (Actrapid human/Monotard human) instantly results in a decrease of regular insulin, probably due to formation of a longer-acting preparation, whereas no such changes occur with human biosynthetic regular and NPH insulins (Humulin regular/Humulin NPH).\r"

Patients were divided into three groups: group 1, stimulated CP less than 0.06 nM (n = 51); group 2, stimulated CP 0.06-0.60 nM (n = 48); and group 3, stimulated CP greater than 0.60 nM (n = 33). In all patients fasting CP was closely correlated to stimulated CP (r = .988, P less than .001), whereas the correlations between UCP and both fasting CP (r = .904, P less than .001) and stimulated CP r = .902, P less than .001) were slightly less pronounced. The associations between UCP and both fasting CP (r = .716, P less than .001) and stimulated CP (r = .731, P less than .001) were modest in group 2, and even more so in group 3 (r = .557, P less than .001 and r = .641, P less than .001, respectively). In conclusion, fasting CP is closely correlated to glucagon-stimulated CP in insulin-treated diabetics and can probably be used equally well in the assessment of beta-cell function. The associations between UCP and both fasting and glucagon-stimulated CP are less pronounced, especially in patients with well-preserved beta-cell function.\r"

  ".W": "alpha 2u-Globulin is the principal urinary protein of the mature male rat. The major urinary source of this protein is the liver where it is synthesized and secreted by hepatocytes under hormonal regulation. High levels of alpha 2u-globulin and its messenger RNA (mRNA) are also present in the preputial gland of both male and female rats, and neither castration nor ovariectomy significantly alters the preputial concentration of this protein and its mRNA. Per unit mass of RNA and protein, the preputial gland as compared to liver contains about 3-fold higher level of alpha 2u-globulin mRNA and about 300-fold higher level of alpha 2u-globulin. Despite a 3-fold (300%) difference in the content of alpha 2u-globulin mRNA, nuclear run-off experiments show only a 30% higher rate of alpha 2u-globulin gene transcription in the preputial gland than in the liver. Immunocytochemical analyses reveal that the liver possesses two alpha 2u-globulin cell populations, one showing higher immunoreactivity than the other. In contrast, the preputial gland contains only one type of alpha 2u-globulin containing acinar cells, and a large amount of alpha 2u-globulin accumulates in the ductal lumen. From these results we conclude that the 300% higher level of alpha 2u-globulin mRNA in the preputial gland is not due to a corresponding difference in the rate of transcription of alpha 2u-globulin gene. Such a difference may represent tissue-specific regulation at a posttranscriptional level of mRNA metabolism. Furthermore, the huge difference in the alpha 2u-globulin content of the preputial gland and the liver is primarily due to the cellular and ductal accumulation of this protein in the preputial gland vs. its rapid secretion by the liver.\r"

  ".U": "87303959\r", 
  ".W": "The dynamics of insulin release were investigated in vitro in order to determine the regulatory processes governing its biphasic shape. When subjected to a square wave glucose stimulation, the isolated perfused rat pancreas responded with typical biphasic insulin release. Both the duration of the nadir between the two phases and the slope of recovery of insulin release during second-phase secretion exhibited glucose dose dependency. Successive 40-min stimuli with glucose (8.3 and 16.7 mM), separated by a 20-min rest period, resulted in 2.6- 3.3-fold potentiation of the early phase insulin release rate, previously described as glucose-primed time-dependent potentiation (TDP) of insulin secretion. A linear relationship (r = 0.89, P less than 0.001) was observed between the degree of TDP and the slope of second-phase insulin release. Successive short stimuli with glucose (5-10 min long, 5-10 min apart; 6.9, 8.3, and 16.7 mM) resulted in the inhibition of the response to the second stimulus; this effect was termed time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of insulin release. Arginine also induced TDI; this was completely overcome by synergistic interaction with glucose (8.3 mM). The glucose-arginine interaction was utilized to demonstrate that the interphasic nadir of insulin release was the expression of TDI. Thus, introduction of an arginine stimulus during the nadir in glucose-induced insulin release abolished the silent phase, the secretion rate reaching the level expected for the combined glucose-arginine stimulus. However, the continued presence of TDI could be demonstrated by removal of the arginine stimulus, at which time, despite ongoing glucose stimulation, insulin secretion was markedly inhibited. These observations support the concept that the biphasic dynamics of insulin release is the net expression of three regulatory processes: 1) the acute stimulus-secretion coupling system, best observed as the immediate, first-phase response to a stimulus; 2) TDI of insulin release, a relatively rapid signal responsible for the silent period; and 3) TDP of insulin release, a slow rising signal responsible for recovery from the silent phase, building up the second-phase of secretion.\r"

At a nonstimulatory concentration of glucose (3 mM), 100 nM TPA, but not 10 nM TPA, slightly and slowly increased insulin release and 45Ca2+ efflux and decreased 86Rb+ efflux, but did not affect the membrane potential of B-cells. At a threshold concentration of glucose (7 mM), 100 nM TPA markedly increased insulin release without triggering electrical activity in B-cells. At a stimulatory concentration of glucose (10 mM), TPA caused a dose-dependent irreversible increase in insulin release, 45Ca2+ efflux, and 86Rb+ efflux and slightly augmented islet cAMP levels. Omission of extracellular Ca2+ abolished the effects of 10 nM TPA and partially inhibited those of 100 nM TPA on insulin release and 45Ca2+ efflux. In contrast, their effect on 86Rb+ efflux was paradoxically augmented. Glucose-induced electrical activity in B-cells was only marginally affected by TPA; the duration of the slow waves with spikes was not modified, but a small shortening of the polarized intervals raised their frequency and slightly increased the overall activity. This increase was significant only with 10 nM TPA, whereas only 100 nM TPA brought about a minute increase in 45Ca2+ influx. These results thus show that TPA induces insulin release or potentiates glucose-induced insulin release without mimicking or amplifying the initial ionic and electrical signals triggered by glucose. They suggest that protein kinase C activation affects stimulus-secretion coupling by modulating intracellular and/or nonelectrogenic membrane events.\r"

[35S]Cysteine-labeled carrier protein precursors were immunoprecipitated using antibodies raised to the approximately 33,000 Mr carrier protein from BRL-3A cells that recognize the IGF carrier protein present in fetal and neonatal rat serum, but not in adult rat serum. The IGF carrier protein is synthesized as a 35,000 Mr precursor in a reticulocyte lysate translation system directed by RNA from BRL-3A cells or REFs. Supplementation of the translation incubation with microsomal membranes decreases the size of the precursor to 33,000 Mr, presumably by removal of a signal peptide. In continuous labeling or pulse-chase experiments of intact BRL-3A cells or REFs, the 33,000 Mr protein is labeled within 10 min intracellularly, appears in the medium after 40 min, and persists in the medium for 24 h without a change in size. The intracellular carrier protein was biosynthetically labeled in BRL-3A cells with [3H]leucine, [3H]phenylalanine, [3H]arginine, or [35S]cysteine and purified, and its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. Eleven of 34 residues were identified and correspond to those of mature unlabeled carrier protein purified from conditioned medium, indicating that after removal of the signal peptide, the carrier protein undergoes no detectable further processing at its NH2-terminus. These results establish that although they are regulated coordinately, IGF-II and the fetal IGF carrier protein are synthesized as separate proteins. Finally, RNA extracted from fetal, but not adult, rat liver directs the synthesis of the 35,000 Mr carrier protein precursor, suggesting that the developmental regulation of the carrier protein may occur at the level of RNA abundance.\r"

Administration of a polyclonal antiserum to partially purified LHRIF potentiates estrogen-induced LH release and antagonizes the inhibitory effect of estrogen and progesterone on LH release in ovariectomized rats.

  ".U": "87303973\r", 
  ".W": "Sodium vanadate, a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, was found to down-regulate the number of cell surface receptors in primary cultured adipocytes (50% receptor loss by 24 h; 65% loss by 48 h; ED50, 17 and 9 microM, respectively). The characteristics of vanadate-induced down-regulation were distinguished by three salient features. First, time-course studies revealed a lag period of 4-6 h preceding vanadate-induced receptor loss. This lag period was not due to slow diffusion of vanadate into the cell, since it could not be shortened using a very high dose of vanadate (1 mM). Second, vanadate was found to trigger receptor loss, such that down-regulation continued after vanadate removal. Thus, no immediate down-regulation was observed in adipocytes exposed to 80 microM vanadate for 6 h. However, when cells were washed and reincubated in vanadate-free medium for an additional 18 h (24 h total), a 50% receptor loss was seen. Lastly, we found that vanadate-induced down-regulation was not readily reversible, since receptor recovery was not observed when 24-h down-regulated cells were reincubated in vanadate-free medium for an additional 24 h. These three features of vanadate-induced receptor loss are remarkably similar to the characteristics of insulin-induced down-regulation. In studies examining the relationship between protein synthesis and vanadate-induced down-regulation, we found that vanadate markedly stimulated the overall rate of protein synthesis in 24-h treated adipocytes (a 42% increase; ED50, 3 microM), and that cycloheximide treatment markedly blunted vanadate-induced loss of cell surface receptors. Overall, these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in regulating the number of cell surface insulin receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Progesterone receptor (PR) from a human endometrial carcinoma (EnCa 101) grown in nude mice consists of two hormone-binding proteins with mol wt around 116,000 and 85,000. To generate monoclonal antibodies against this receptor, PR was partially purified from EnCa 101 and used to immunize Robertsonian mice. Immune mouse spleens were fused with HL-1 Friendly myeloma-653 cells, and hybridomas were screened by solid phase dot-blot assay and double antibody precipitation. Seven stable hybridomas were obtained, designated hPRa 1-7. Subisotyping revealed that hPRa 1 and 6 were immunoglobulin G2b, while the remainder were immunoglobulin G1. Ultracentrifugation in high salt sucrose gradients showed that six of the seven antibodies effected a shift of [3H]progestin-labeled PR from EnCa 101; only hPRa 4 was ineffective in this regard. Protein blots of EnCa 101 cytosols and DEAE eluates revealed that hPRa 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 recognized both PR proteins equally. hPRa 2 recognized principally the 116,000 mol wt PR protein; it recognized the lower mol wt PR protein very poorly if at all, whereas hPRa 6 recognized only the 116,000 mol wt protein. Interestingly, the latter was consistently detected as a closely migrating triplet. Immunolocalization of PR by hPRa 1-7 in tissue sections was confined to nuclei of target tissues and varied in intensity: hPRa 7 greater than 3 = 5 greater than 6 = 2 greater than 1 greater than 4. In proliferative phase uterus, the intensity of staining was ranked: endometrial gland nuclei (3+) greater than myometrial cell nuclei (2-3+) greater than endometrial stromal cell nuclei (0-1+). Thus, seven monoclonal antibodies directed against human PR have been prepared, and their suitability for the study of PR by biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques has been demonstrated.\r"

The inhibitor is heat stable and resistant to enzymatic treatment with trypsin, chymotrypsin, proteinase K, deoxyribonuclease I, or ribonucleases A, T1, and U2. Results of chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-150 indicate that the factor is a negatively charged macromolecule. Inhibitory activity is sensitive to sequential digestion with chondroitinase ABC, hyaluronidase, and heparinase. Approximately 70% of the inhibitory activity is destroyed by treatment with heparinase alone. Heparitinase destroys only 30% of this activity. Furthermore, the addition of pure hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfate to the ER-nuclei binding assay results in little inhibition, whereas addition of heparin inhibits 75% of receptor binding. Overall, these results indicate that glycosaminoglycans, present in bovine uterine cytosol, are capable of inhibiting ER-nuclei interactions. The most potent inhibitory glycosaminoglycan displays heparin-like characteristics.\r"

BDGF was purified from calvarial culture medium with dialysis, gel filtration and HPLC. Amino acid composition of BDGF was compatible with murine beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2 m), and amino terminal sequence analysis revealed identity with mature murine beta 2 m. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody to beta 2 m. Like BDGF, human beta 2 m stimulated bone DNA, collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis. Thus, BDGF, an autologous regulator of bone formation, is homologous to beta 2 m.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular mechanisms by which carbohydrate refeeding reverses the effect of fasting on T3 metabolism were studied in primary cultures of hepatocytes (24 h) harvested from 48-h fasted rats. Net T3 neogenesis (T3 generated from T4) in the fasted hepatocyte preparations (9.2 +/- 0.9 pmol/min X 100 mg protein) was significantly less (P less than 0.001) than that in hepatocyte cultures derived from 72-h glucose-fed rats (41 +/- 0.8 pmol/min X 100 mg protein). Preincubation (18 h) with either glucose (2.5-10 mM) or insulin (10-500 nM) significantly increased the fasted hepatocyte T3 levels to 28 +/- 0.6 and 22 +/- 1.3 pmol/min X 100 mg protein, respectively. Furthermore, incubation with both of these agents demonstrated a greater effect on hepatic T3 neogenesis than with either alone. Fasted hepatocyte T3 neogenesis was enhanced by enrichment with dithiothreitol (5 mM), but the T3 generation remained significantly less than that in cells exposed to glucose or insulin. Studies with glucose analogs demonstrated that preincubation with 2-deoxyglucose (5 mM) significantly increased (P less than 0.001) hepatocyte T3 neogenesis, but 3-O-methylglucose (5 mM) had no effect. In contrast, the insulin-mimetic compounds Concanavalin-A or spermine did not stimulate T3 neogenesis in the fasted hepatocyte cultures. Thus, rat hepatocytes sustained in primary culture for 24 h retain the T3 metabolic characteristics of the intact animal. Glucose and insulin reverse the effect of fasting on hepatocyte T3 neogenesis. The additive response to glucose and insulin suggests that T3 neogenesis is modulated through different mechanisms. The replication of the glucose effect by 2-deoxyglucose and the inability of dithiothreitol to reverse the effect of fasting on hepatocyte T4 5'-deiodinase activity suggest that neither intermediates in the glycolytic pathway nor thiol cofactors mediate the glucose effect. Thus, the restoration of liver T3 metabolism consequent to carbohydrate refeeding of the fasted rat may be mediated by the glucose and insulin responses.\r"

  ".U": "87303994\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study we investigated the extent to which expression of the diurnal pattern of LH secretion in prepubertal female rats is driven by an ovarian-independent neuroendocrine mechanism. To remove gonadal influences, rats were ovariectomized (OVX) during early juvenile, late juvenile, or peripubertal phases of development (20-22, 26-27, and 32-33 days of age, respectively), and blood samples were collected throughout the day (every 30-60 min) 2 or 4 days after surgery. Morning plasma LH levels were relatively low 2 days after ovariectomy (30-120 ng/ml), but rose during the afternoon to reach levels ranging from 180-300 ng/ml. This afternoon elevation was sustained both in late juvenile and peripubertal rats, but not in early juvenile rats. The predominant change observed 4 days after ovariectomy was an overall 3- to 6-fold increase in plasma LH levels, which masked the afternoon elevation. Analysis of plasma LH profiles from individual rats, however, revealed that at each of the three ages studied the peak plasma LH levels occurred in the afternoon, and these were most pronounced in the peripubertal animals. To further clarify the existence of such a diurnal pattern of LH release in the 4-day OVX animals pulsatile LH release profiles were obtained from individual animals, using a 5-min bleeding paradigm, at either 24 days (in the morning) or 36 days of age (in either the morning or the afternoon). LH release was episodic in all of the animals studied, with pulses occurring on average of about once every 30 min. Analysis of the plasma LH profiles using the PULSAR algorithm revealed that the overall mean plasma LH levels of the peripubertal animals was enhanced during the afternoon, compared to that in the morning or to the afternoon LH levels in the early juvenile rats. Mean nadir and mean peak LH levels were also greater. No differences in LH pulse amplitude and only marginal differences in LH pulse frequency were detected among the three groups studied. The enhancement of afternoon LH secretion in the OVX rats could not be attributed to age-related or diurnal changes in adenohypophyseal responsiveness to LHRH. The results suggest that the initiation of enhanced afternoon LH secretion, previously shown to occur in intact female rats during the juvenile-peripubertal transition period, results primarily from the activation of a central neuroendocrine mechanism. Although the ovaries might play a role in the development of this diurnal pattern, it is clear that its activation is ovarian independent.\r"

Here we have demonstrated that while chronic incubation with insulin stimulated DNA synthesis by 3- to 6-fold, TPA, in contrast, did not stimulate DNA synthesis and, indeed, caused a 70% inhibition of insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion. In differentiated myocytes, insulin maximally stimulated hydroxyurea-sensitive [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA at 200-400 nM with an ED50 of 5-8 nM, suggesting that insulin stimulates DNA synthesis via the insulin receptor rather than through growth factor receptors. Phorbol ester inhibition of insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis was specific for the active tumor-promoting phorbols and the synthetic diacylglycerol 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol. Maximal TPA inhibition of insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis was observed at 100 nM with an ID50 of 30 nM TPA, values analogous to those required for TPA stimulation of hexose transport in the myocyte. Chronic incubation with TPA did not inhibit insulin-stimulated protein synthesis, acute K+ flux, K+ accumulation, cytosolic thymidine levels, or insulin binding, indicating that TPA inhibits a specific intracellular event mediating DNA synthesis and suggesting that the acute and chronic effects of insulin in BC3H-1 myocytes are regulated by distinct pathways.\r"

  ".W": "An antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the human insulin receptor (Anti-R beta C). Immunoprecipitation of the human insulin receptor and immunoblotting to the beta-subunit by Anti-R beta C could be inhibited by competition with the corresponding peptide. However, even at saturating concentrations, anti-R beta C could not completely immunoprecipitate or immunodeplete insulin receptors compared to a human autoantibody (anti-R B2). Using receptor labeled directly by 125I, evidence of multiple forms of the beta-subunit was found. When the receptor could be immunoprecipitated by anti-R beta C, the beta-subunit migrated with an apparent mol wt (MW) of 96,000 (at or above the phosphorylase b MW marker). However, in preparations where anti-R beta C was not able to immunoprecipitate the insulin receptor, the beta-subunit migrated at a significantly lower MW of 91,000 (below phosphorylase b), as detected by immunoprecipitation with Anti-R B2. Intermediate forms could also be detected. Phosphorylation of partially purified insulin receptor did not affect is ability to be immunoprecipitated by anti-R beta C, although insulin-stimulated phosphorylation increased the apparent MW of the beta-subunit. However, insulin receptor that was phosphorylated in solubilized extracts of whole cells had a beta-subunit that migrated at lower MW and was not immunoprecipitated by anti-R beta C. One possible explanation for this is that the beta-subunit may be degraded during preparation. When the MW of insulin receptor that has been purified to homogeneity from human placenta is compared to our data, it is clear that many of these insulin receptor preparations contain lower MW beta-subunits. These results must be taken into account when the sites of phosphorylation and kinase activity of purified insulin receptor preparations are studied.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin receptor from human erythrocytes was studied for receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity. Receptor phosphorylation was performed by incubation of the receptor with [gamma-32P]ATP and Mn2+ in the presence or absence of insulin, and the phosphorylated receptor was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In Triton X-100-solubilized, and partially purified, receptor preparations, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of a 95,000 dalton protein in a dose-dependent fashion. Immunoprecipitation with antiinsulin receptor antibodies indicates that this 95,000 dalton protein corresponds to the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor. Phosphoaminoacid analysis revealed that 32P incorporation occurred predominantly on tyrosine residues of the beta-subunit. In addition, the insulin receptor kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of Histone H2b. Dose response curves for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the beta-subunit and Histone H2b were sigmoidal. Both half-maximal effects were observed at 3 X 10(-9) M insulin with maximal effects at 10(-6) M. When insulin binding was examined under the same conditions as phosphorylation, the dose-response curves for receptor occupancy and the kinase activation were nearly superimposable, indicating few or no spare receptors for this response to insulin. Insulin-stimulated receptor phosphorylation was diminished by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide, indicating that the receptor possesses sulfhydryl groups, which are important for its enzyme activity. This study demonstrates that insulin receptor kinase from human erythrocytes shares characteristics which are similar to those found in other classical insulin target cells and tissues.\r"

These include mechanisms of epileptogenesis, ictal initiation and temporary entrainment by the seizure discharge of normally functioning brain, seizure propagation, and control mechanisms that function both to restrain the cascade of epileptic events culminating in a seizure and to arrest the epileptic event and restore the interictal state. In newborns and children, hypoxia-ischemia is a major factor leading to epileptogenesis, and several schemes are proposed to classify, quantify, and prevent hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Control mechanisms must be better understood in order to develop prophylactic recommendations for epilepsy, and an experimental model of \"kindling antagonism\" may increase our understanding of these. Programs of prevention of seizures in children will evolve only if basic researchers and clinicians work productively together to develop an adequate understanding of factors important in epileptogenesis and antiepileptogenic control mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiological studies indicate that the incidence of seizures is highest early in life. This report discusses the experimental data derived from studies of focal epileptogenesis of the immature brain in tandem with ongoing maturational changes. During development, neurons have characteristic neurophysiological properties. Local interictal discharges are long in duration, lack a stereotypic morphology, and have limited fields. Yet the immature brain is very susceptible to the development of bilateral, although asynchronous, seizures and status epilepticus induced by amygdala kindling or by convulsant drugs. This increased seizure susceptibility may be due to a functional immaturity of a substantia nigra, GABA-sensitive output system. The morbidity of convulsions occurring early in life may not be as grave as previously thought in terms of subsequent acquisition of \"normal\" developmental milestones. The propensity to develop recurrent convulsions in adulthood is not related to the severity of a single seizure in infancy. Although multiple severe seizures may predispose animals to the development of seizures later in life, this is not a unique feature of the immature brain, since it also occurs in the adult brain. Finally, there is evidence that the immature brain may respond to anticonvulsant drugs differently from its mature counterpart; these findings emphasize the need to develop new antiepileptic therapies that take into account the maturational state of the brain.\r"

  ".W": "Pediatric patients have greater degrees of pharmacokinetic variability and unpredictability than adults. This variability results from the effects of pharmacogenetics, age and growth, prior and current comedication, and disease. Newborns with seizures have the least predictable dosage requirements, and their needs change as drug-eliminating mechanisms mature in the neonatal period. Infants have the highest relative capacities to eliminate antiepileptics of any age group and require the largest relative doses. In addition to age-related trends, children demonstrate the same drug-specific, pharmacokinetic phenomena that adults do, including nonlinear phenytoin elimination, nonlinear valproate binding, and autoinduction of carbamazepine. Intercurrent illness and drug interactions further modify the age-related pharmacokinetic patterns in children and make dosage requirements even more unpredictable. Recent studies have shown that febrile illness can affect drug elimination, sometimes decreasing drug levels by 50% or more. Intermittent treatment with benzodiazepines administered either orally or rectally can be an important adjunct and help minimize this type of problem for children with marginally controlled epilepsy. Intermittent benzodiazepines are also helpful for children who have febrile seizures and who need only occasional antiepileptic protection.\r"

In addition, the method also permits simultaneous ECoG and video monitoring during the child's symptomatic seizures, providing additional important localizing information that is impractical to obtain in operations under local anesthesia. We report our experience with 75 children, ages 5 months to 15 years, whom we have managed with epidural electrode arrays. The method of extraoperative ECoG is described and illustrative cases are presented to demonstrate its feasibility and utility in children. In addition, we call attention to gliomas as a common cause of chronic focal seizures in children. Of 49 children undergoing resection and followed for from 1 to 14 years (mean of 5.8 years), 32 (65%) are either seizure free or have had a significant reduction in seizure frequency that has unambiguously improved their quality of life. The results are analyzed further by relating the surgical outcome to each of the pathologic entities that caused the seizures. This analysis reveals the variety of neurological conditions that commonly cause intractable focal seizure disorder in children and distinguishes those pathologic entities in which the seizure disorder is apt to respond to surgical intervention from those that will not.\r"

Figure 1 shows the chemical diversity of some of the drug groups that affect reproductive hormones. Their structural dissimilarity to the steroid hormones is also readily apparent in the figure. These chemically diverse drugs share an important pharmacologic property: they are highly potent neuroactive drugs, and they can disrupt hypothalamic-pituitary function. Although it is frequently difficult to distinguish between direct drug actions on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and subsequent effects on gonadal hormones and sex accessory gland function, the distinction is an important one. Most neuroactive drugs produce only transient effects on the central nervous pathways necessary for normal gonadotropin secretion. The disruptive effects of these drugs are likely to be transient and completely reversible, and tolerance to the inhibitory drug effects may occur even with continued drug use. Under these circumstances, normal adults may experience only subtle changes in sexual function. However, individuals with compromised reproductive function may exhibit major problems. It is also likely that adolescents may be at substantial risk for reproductive damage from these neuroactive drugs since the endocrine events associated with puberty are dependent on the normal development of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.\r"

Spermatozoa from 300 men who were investigated for infertility were tested for sperm surface antibodies using the Immunobead test (IBT). IBTs for IgG, IgA, and IgM were performed on each sample as well as an IBT using an Immunobead with activity against both light and heavy immunoglobulin chains and therefore capable of detecting any of the three isotypes (\"GAM-IBT\"). An excellent correspondence was found between GAM-IBT-positive samples and those positive by one or more of the isotype-specific Immunobeads. In 29 of 32 positive tests, the GAM bead binding was within 5% of the most positive isotype-specific bead's binding. There were no false-positive or false-negative tests comparing the GAM-IBT with the isotype-specific IBTs.\r"

Terms gain a usage which belies the reality to which they refer, code words come to serve as a substitute for thought, and concepts seemingly acquire a life of their own. Such is the case with the concept of positive health. For almost four decades this concept has been bandied about. Often it is raised only to be disclaimed or with the intent to depreciate its relevance. However, it is probably invoked with equal frequency as an ambiguous but reassuring kind of appeal. Discussions of the concept rarely deal with its operational implications and never seem to manifest appreciation of its origin. Attention is here directed to its original formulation and to Andrija Stampar, the person most directly responsible for this, in order to facilitate consideration of its current significance.\r"

All patients received corticosteroids and sampling occurred at 6-12-mo intervals during 96 +/- 6 mo of follow-up. Twenty-nine patients (35%) had an abnormal level. In 26 patients, the abnormality was at presentation. In 3 patients, the abnormality developed 11-127 mo later. Two of these patients had primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were higher in patients with an alpha-fetoprotein elevation at presentation (p less than 0.02). After therapy, the alpha-fetoprotein level normalized and patients entering remission had lower levels than at entry (p less than 0.001). alpha-Fetoprotein levels, however, did not correlate closely with serum aspartate aminotransferase levels at entry nor did they distinguish patients with different patterns of histologic activity. Outcomes after therapy were similar in patients with and without alpha-fetoprotein elevation. Three patients (4%) developed primary hepatocellular carcinoma after 113 +/- 26 mo but only 2 had elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels. We conclude that elevation of the alpha-fetoprotein level occurs commonly at presentation. The abnormality frequently resolves after corticosteroid therapy and it does not have prognostic significance. An elevation that occurs after treatment suggests primary hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

A final diagnosis of malignancy was established in 65 cases, of which fine needle aspiration biopsy cytology revealed a concordant diagnosis in 54 cases. The diagnostic sensitivity of this technique was 83% for malignant lesions with 93% specificity. Of the 54 cases with malignant cytology, it was possible to distinguish between a primary or secondary lesion in 31 cases (57%). Benign lesions were aspirated in 32 cases, of which 30 cases concorded with the final diagnosis.

  ".W": "Escherichia coli strain RDEC-1 (serotype 015:NM) is an effacing adherent enteropathogen that binds to the intestine of rabbits in a manner morphologically identical to the binding of human enteropathogenic E. coli strains to human intestine. The rabbit enteropathogen adheres to mucosal enterocytes in vivo and to microvillus membranes in vitro. Binding of RDEC-1 to ileal brush borders and to M cells overlying Peyer's patches is mediated by pili (fimbriae) expressed on the cell surface of bacteria. To examine whether similar binding occurs to glycoproteins present in the intestinal lumen, RDEC-1 was fed to rabbits and the intestinal luminal contents were examined for in vivo colonization by RDEC-1. In addition, preparations of rabbit luminal glycoproteins were tested for their ability to agglutinate RDEC-1 in vitro. After the infection of rabbits, RDEC-1 organisms were found in the intestinal lumen associated with glycoproteins, as defined by positive histochemical staining of luminal material by periodic acid-Schiff and Alcian blue. In vitro aggregation of RDEC-1 by luminal glycoproteins of rabbit intestine, a luminal glycoprotein fraction purified on column chromatography and rabbit ileal microvillus membranes, was determined using a microtiter plate assay and an aggregometer. Nonpiliated RDEC-1 did not interact with either of the intestinal glycoprotein preparations or microvillus membranes. RDEC-1 expressing mannose-resistant AF/R1 pili or mannose-sensitive type 1 pili coaggregated with both rabbit luminal glycoprotein preparations and rabbit ileal microvillus membranes at equivalent protein concentrations. These studies demonstrate that RDEC-1 are associated with luminal glycoproteins during in vivo infection of rabbits, and that piliated RDEC-1, but not nonpiliated, coaggregate with rabbit glycoprotein preparations in vitro. Luminal glycoproteins contained within the mucus layer may serve as a site for replication and colonization of bacteria before bacterial enteroadherence.\r"

  ".W": "The potential role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a mediator of gastrointestinal ulceration associated with septic shock was examined in the rat. The damaging effects of both PAF and Escherichia coli endotoxin in the stomach and small intestine were compared, as were their effects on plasma leakage into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Intravenous administration of either endotoxin or PAF produced extensive necrosis and vascular congestion in the stomach and small intestine, but not the distal colon. With either agent, the duodenum and jejunum were the tissues most susceptible to damage and in which the greatest plasma leakage was observed. The prolonged hypotension and gastrointestinal damage induced by PAF or endotoxin were significantly inhibited by three structurally dissimilar PAF antagonists (CV-3988, BN-52021, and Ro-193704). CV-3988 (10 mg/kg) significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced both endotoxin- and PAF-induced plasma leakage in the stomach and small intestine. Of the three antagonists, only CV-3988 significantly reduced ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage, perhaps reflecting actions of this compound unrelated to antagonism of PAF receptors. These studies support the hypothesis that PAF is an important mediator of the hypotension and plasma leakage observed during endotoxic shock and its endogenous release may contribute to the gastrointestinal ulceration associated with this syndrome. Thus, PAF receptor antagonists may be useful for prevention of such ulceration.\r"

In 13 of 19 patients (68.4%) with detectable pepsinogen A, different isozymogen patterns were found between the Barrett's epithelium and the gastric corpus mucosa. Discrepancies consisted mainly of a stronger pepsinogen 5 band in the Barrett's epithelium, with a higher incidence in biopsy specimens with features of dysplasia than with no or indefinite dysplasia; the difference was, however, not statistically significant. Zymograms of 69 biopsy specimens from Barrett's epithelium were correlated with the histologic type: pepsinogen A and C were most frequently found in the fundic type, least often in the specialized intestinal type. In control gastric corpus biopsy specimens, pepsinogen A and C as well as slow-moving protease were always detectable. The observed variability of gastric protease patterns, in particular of pepsinogen A isozymograms, may be due to differences in expression within the pepsinogen A cluster, suggesting a deregulation of gene expression or partial deletion of the pepsinogen A gene cluster.\r"

After 48 h in culture the ultrastructural appearance of the enteroglucagon-immunoreactive cells showed evidence of polarization with re-formation of apical microvilli and the secretory granules concentrated at the opposite pole of the cell. The size of the intracellular secretory granules was 370 +/- 15 nm. The release of enteroglucagonlike immunoreactivity was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by the adrenergic agonists epinephrine and isoproterenol. The response to epinephrine was competitively inhibited by propranolol, producing a rightward shift of the dose-responsive curve. The alpha-adrenergic agonists methoxamine and clonidine did not stimulate enteroglucagon release above basal. The adenyl cyclase activator forskolin also stimulated release of the peptide in a dose-dependent manner. Carbachol and somatostatin produced a dose-dependent inhibition of epinephrine-stimulated release, indicating direct inhibitory modulation of enteroglucagonlike immunoreactive cells. Somatostatin also inhibited forskolin-stimulated release. These data indicate that canine ileal enteroglucagon cells in short-term culture respond to a number of specific stimuli.\r"

For manometric assessment, a perfused variceal needle punctured each variceal column and, if low pressures fluctuating with respiration were obtained, the varix was injected. Control patients had patent varices injected based on visual assessment alone. During a mean follow-up of 13 mo (range 4-16 mo), 1 manometrically assessed patient bled once (0.002 bleeds/patient month) and 7 visually assessed patients bled 14 times from varices (0.03 bleeds/patient-month) (p less than 0.05). Two and nine episodes of ulceration occurred in manometric and visually assessed patients, respectively, (p less than 0.05). Varices were obliterated (i.e., disappeared) in 11 patients undergoing manometric assessment and in 2 patients undergoing visual assessment (p less than 0.01). Comparing results of visual and manometric assessment within \"manometric\" patients showed a consistent 25% error rate in diagnosing patency or thrombosis by visual assessment. Manometric assessment of varices during maintenance sclerotherapy reduces rebleeding and ulceration to very low levels.\r"

The highest concentrations of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity were found in the stomach (45 +/- 2.8 pmol/g wet wt, nonsecretory region; 38.7 +/- 4.4 pmol/g wet wt, secretory region) and rectum (30.9 +/- 1.6 pmol/g wet wt). Significant amounts of peptide were also found in the other regions of the gut and in the pancreas. Neonatal treatment with capsaicin, which causes a permanent degeneration of most of the small-diameter sensory neurons, reduced calcitonin gene-related peptide content by greater than 95% in the esophagus and stomach, by 60% in the pancreas, and by less than 50% in the intestine, when compared with littermate controls. Separation of extracts from the gut, pancreas, and brain by chromatography gave major peaks corresponding to the predicted rat calcitonin gene-related peptide and small unidentified peaks, which presumably arise from metabolism of the peptide. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that in the esophagus and stomach, calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity is restricted to nerve fibers, whereas in the intestine it is localized in both nerve fibers and enteric ganglion cells. In capsaicin-treated rats there was a virtually complete elimination of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive fibers innervating the esophagus and stomach, whereas in the small and large intestine there was a dramatic reduction and often a complete elimination of those associated with blood vessels and a slighter reduction of the nonvascular immunoreactive fibers. The results of this study indicate that calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive nerve fibers innervating the rat digestive system originate from both intrinsic (enteric) and extrinsic (presumably sensory) sources and that both the intrinsic and extrinsic components appear to contain a substance that corresponds to the predicted calcitonin gene-related peptide.\r"

The number of sclerotherapy sessions needed with intravariceal technique were also significantly less. Rebleeding was seen in 38.5% patients after para and 14.3% after intravariceal injections (NS). Except for retrosternal pain, which occurred more often (p less than 0.01) with paravariceal technique, there was no difference in the incidence of other complications or mortality between the two groups.

  ".W": "The role of insulin in the regulation of blood pressure was evaluated in 50 obese adolescents before and after a 20-week weight loss program. When compared with 10 nonobese adolescents, the obese subjects had significantly higher systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures (p = 0.005), an elevated 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (p = 0.002), an elevated fasting insulin concentration (p = 0.001), and an abnormal insulin response to an oral glucose tolerance test (sum of the insulins at 0, 1, and 2 hours post-oral glucose load; p = 0.001). We also observed a significant correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressure (age and sex normalized) and body weight (r = 0.57, p less than 0.01 and r = 0.7, p less than 0.01), fasting insulin (r = 0.49, p less than 0.01 and r = 0.54, p less than 0.01), and sum of insulins (r = 0.42, p less than 0.01 and r = 0.46, p less than 0.01). To study the effect of weight loss on the relationship between blood pressure and insulin, the obese subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: 15 to a diet and behavior change group, 18 to a diet, behavior change, and exercise group, and 17 to an obese control group. Compared with the obese control group, the two weight loss groups each experienced a significant decrease in insulin (p less than 0.01), sum of the insulins (p less than 0.01), and blood pressure (p less than 0.01). The decrease in blood pressure during the weight loss program significantly correlated with the change in both insulin and body weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Activation of renal or vascular prostaglandin mechanisms (or both) has been proposed to contribute to the antihypertensive action of captopril. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) studied in the established phase of hypertension, the blood pressure-lowering effect of captopril, 30 mg/kg/12 hr p.o. given for 7 days, was greatly enhanced by the addition of aspirin, 200 mg/kg/day s.c. Systolic blood pressure decreased from 185 +/- 6 and 182 +/- 4 to 135 +/- 3 mm Hg in rats treated, respectively, with captopril and aspirin or captopril alone, and was unaltered by either vehicle or aspirin alone. Water intake was inconsistently affected by captopril but was increased (p less than 0.01) by aspirin and was even higher after captopril-aspirin treatment (p less than 0.01). Urine volume was elevated in all 3 drug-treated groups, increasing threefold after captopril-aspirin treatment. Excretion of sodium and potassium was unchanged by any treatment regimen. In the vehicle group, prostaglandin F2 alpha excretion, measured by radioimmunoassay, ranged between 65 and 93 ng/8 hr and was twofold to fourfold higher than that of prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin F2 alpha was unaffected during captopril treatment, whereas prostaglandin E2 excretion decreased to 12 +/- 2 ng/8 hr (p less than 0.01) by Day 7. Long-term aspirin treatment, either with or without captopril, did not cause sustained inhibition of renal prostaglandin excretion, although a transient effect occurred within the first four hours of administration. These results indicate 1) aspirin potentiates the blood pressure-lowering effect of captopril in SHR, an effect that is associated with a threefold increase in urine flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with Stage II and III carcinoma of the glottis, tongue, and hypopharynx had significantly increased numbers of all T lymphocyte phenotypes when compared to patients with Stage IV disease, thus achieving statistical significance for the T11 and T8 phenotypes. All patients were followed for 2.5 years; those patients who remained free of malignant disease had an increased number of all T lymphocyte phenotypes compared to patients with recurrent malignancy, but this did not achieve statistical significance. Thus, increased numbers of T11 positive lymphocytes of both the T4 and T8 subsets in the tissue at the margins of head and neck tumors were associated with a more favorable prognosis. These results support the concept of an immunologic reaction at the tumor margin, which may be limiting the growth and spread of tumor.\r"

The major advantage of B-mode sonography is its ability to detect neoplasms in solid scarred neck tissue, commonly seen in patients with radical neck surgery. Postoperative or radiogenic edema, tumor recurrence, and lymph node involvement can be differentiated. Inflammatory and neoplastic lymph node diseases detected by echography must be differentiated by biopsy. Tumor recurrence was seen in 21 of 152 patients by echography. Twelve patients were diagnosed by clinical examination and 17 were diagnosed by computed tomography. Two false positive and one false negative sonographic diagnoses were made. B-mode sonography is an important instrument in the follow-up examination of head and neck tumors for early detection of tumor recurrence or tumor persistence.\r"

Much of that paper was ignored in the English language literature and some of the contents have been misquoted. This has been to the great detriment of the surgical treatment of intraoral cancer in the English-speaking world, which has only recently accepted similar principles and practice to that described by Polya and von Navratil.

Trains of rectangular cathodal pulses of 40-100 microA at 50 Hz and 0.1 ms duration were delivered through monopolar glass microelectrodes with a tip diameter of 10-20 micron, filled with indium-Woods metal alloy. Electrical stimulation at 232 histologically identified sites within the external cuneate nucleus could evoke changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity. In a further set of experiments, a change in respiration was observed at 74 identified sites. An increase or decrease in all parameters measured could be elicited at different stimulus sites within the external cuneate nucleus. Repositioning of the electrode (0.2-0.4 mm) in depth or laterally could result in a different response with stimulation. Microinjections of D,L-homocysteic acid or glutamate could mimic the evoked changes in blood pressure, heart rate, efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity, and respiration. This suggests that the external cuneate nucleus contains cell bodies that may modulate components of various cardiac, respiratory and renal reflexes. It is proposed that the external cuneate nucleus may be involved in the integration of somato-autonomic reflex responses.\r"

Arterial blood samples were obtained at rest and during bicycle ergometry. Compared with rest, PRA, ANG II, and Aldo rose to a similar extent during light and moderate exercise. However, at peak exercise ANG II increased significantly more (P less than 0.001) than PRA and Aldo. Thus, with increasing intensity of exercise, the slope of the linear regression of ANG II on PRA became significantly (P less than 0.001) steeper, whereas at maximal exercise the Aldo response did not follow the acute rise in ANG II. At rest as well as during exercise, Aldo rose with increasing ANG II, but the stimulatory effect of ANG II on Aldo was attenuated with higher sodium intake, as estimated from UVNa. Finally, independent of the level of physical activity, UVNa was negatively correlated with PRA, ANG II, and Aldo.\r"

In a volume-displacement plethysmograph, physiological measurements were made at base line and 25 min after establishing a methacholine infusion (0.1-1.0 mg X kg-1 X h-1). Methacholine significantly (P less than 0.05) increased airways resistance (1.9 +/- 0.8 to 8.2 +/- 2.9 cmH2O X l-1 X s), decreased static lung compliance (84.7 +/- 18.5 to 48.2 +/- 9.4 ml/cmH2O), depressed arterial PO2 (81 +/- 17 to 56 +/- 10 Torr), and lowered blood pressure (132 +/- 10 to 69 +/- 18 Torr) and cardiac output (5.7 +/- 1.9 to 4.1 +/- 1.2 l/min). These effects persisted during a further 80 min of methacholine infusion conducted in five of the animals. During the initial 25-min period of methacholine, the end-expired volume (volume-displacement Krogh spirometer) rose in all animals, indicating an increase in functional residual capacity from 997 +/- 115 to 1,623 +/- 259 ml (P less than 0.0005). Analysis of pulmonary pressure-volume curves revealed no change in total lung capacity but an increase in residual volume from 489 +/- 168 to 1,106 +/- 216 ml (P less than 0.001). Thus methacholine caused 617 ml of gas trapping, which was not detected by the Boyle's law principle, presumably because gas was trapped at high transpulmonary pressure. We suggest that intravenous methacholine-induced canine bronchoconstriction, which causes gas trapping and hypoxia, may be a useful animal model of clinical status asthmaticus.\r"

However, previous experiments with rats demonstrated progressive increases in muscle blood flow over time during prolonged submaximal exercise. The present study was performed to study muscle blood flow in miniature swine during long-term exercise to shed light on this apparent anomaly. QT and distribution of QT were studied with radiolabeled microspheres while pigs ran on a level treadmill at a speed (10.5 km/h) requiring 71 +/- 4% of maximal O2 consumption (VO2 max). QT increased 23% from the 5th to the 30th min of exercise, whereas total skeletal muscle flow increased by 49%. Increases in flow in the muscles resulted from decreased resistance, since mean arterial pressure declined over this time period (-7%). In addition, the proportional increases in muscle flow were similar within synergistic muscle groups independent of fiber type composition (e.g., elbow extensors: 59-78%; elbow flexors: 26-40%). The factor that limited continued exercise appeared to be body temperature. Colonic temperature rose in linear fashion over time; the animals became exhausted at approximately 42 degrees C. These flow data are similar to previous findings in rats and indicate that during prolonged treadmill locomotion in quadrupedal animals muscle blood flow increases over time to near maximal levels.\r"

Kellas (1868-1921) was a British physiologist who made pioneering contributions to the exploration of Everest and to the early physiology of extreme altitudes, but his physiological contributions have been almost completely overlooked. Although he had a full-time faculty position at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School in London, he was able to make eight expeditions to the Himalayas in the first two decades of the century, and by 1919 when the first official expedition to Everest was being planned, he probably knew more about the approaches than anybody else. But his most interesting contributions were made in an unpublished manuscript written in 1920 and entitled \"A consideration of the possibility of ascending Mount Everest.\" In this he discussed the physiology of acclimatization and most of the important variables including the summit altitude and barometric pressure, and the alveolar PO2, arterial oxygen saturation, maximal oxygen consumption, and maximal ascent rate near the summit. On the basis of this extensive analysis, he concluded that \"Mount Everest could be ascended by a man of excellent physical and mental constitution in first-rate training, without adventitious aids [supplementary oxygen] if the physical difficulties of the mountain are not too great.\" Kellas was one of the first physiologists to study extreme altitude, and he deserves to be better known.\r"

Isoproterenol was instilled into the airways of excised intact guinea pig lungs for 5 min and resulted in a six to eightfold rise in cAMP. Immediately thereafter, the lungs were washed in and fixed with 10% buffered Formalin. Sections were then stained using immunoperoxidase techniques and monoclonal antibodies directed against cAMP. We found that isoproterenol-stimulated lungs had widespread increased staining for immunoreactive cAMP. The specific cells consistently demonstrating marked increases in staining were airway epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle cells, alveolar and parenchymal macrophages, and alveolar lining cells, including both type I and type II cells, and capillary endothelial cells. Of all tissues, the airway epithelium was the most intensely stained area for beta-agonist-induced immunoreactive cAMP. The techniques employed herein should make possible the in situ localization of cells responding to any stimuli capable of increasing cAMP, thereby allowing the specific identification of cells possessing functional adenylate cyclase-linked receptors.\r"

  ".W": "After a meal, hormones released from the gut potentiate insulin release. This study was undertaken to determine if physiological concentrations of plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulate insulin secretion in man. Employing a specific CCK bioassay, postprandial CCK levels were determined in normal subjects. Ingestion of a mixed liquid meal stimulated an increase in circulating CCK from a mean fasting level of 0.9 +/- 0.2 (SEM) pmol/L to a mean peak level of 7.1 +/- 1.1 pmol/L within 10 min of feeding. After 30 min the mean CCK level fell to 3.5 pmol/L and remained elevated for the remainder of the 90-min experiment. Eight subjects underwent 40-min infusions of either arginine (15 g), mixed amino acids (15 g), or glucose (30 g) with or without the simultaneous infusion of CCK-8. Since CCK-8 has full biological potency, this form was chosen for infusion to reproduce total CCK bioactivity in plasma. CCK-8 was infused at rates of 12 or 24 pmol/kg X h, producing steady state plasma CCK levels of 4.5 +/- 0.7 and 8.2 +/- 1.1 pmol/L, respectively, spanning the range of normal postprandial levels. CCK alone had no effect on insulin, glucose, or glucagon levels. Administration of arginine alone stimulated insulin from a mean basal level of 12.8 +/- 1.3 microU/mL to a peak level of 41.3 +/- 5.4 microU/mL. Infusion of CCK at 12 and 24 pmol/kg X h augmented arginine-stimulated insulin levels to peaks of 62.5 +/- 13.9 and 63.0 +/- 4.0 microU/mL, respectively. Moreover, CCK nearly doubled the total amount of insulin secreted during the arginine infusion. A similar potentiation of glucagon release was found with both doses of CCK. In addition, infusion of a mixture of amino acids with and without concomitant CCK infusions revealed that CCK potentiated the insulin release induced by mixed amino acids. In contrast to the potent effect of CCK on amino acid-induced insulin release, infusions of CCK together with glucose caused no enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin release. These results demonstrate that physiological concentrations of CCK potentiate amino acid (but not glucose)-induced insulin secretion in man. These data suggest, therefore, that CCK may have a role in man as a modulator of insulin release.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the prevalence of both basal and glucose-stimulated hyperinsulinemia and acanthosis nigricans (AN) as well as the relationship between insulin and androgen levels in hyperandrogenic women. Sixty-two women who had an elevation of 1 or more plasma androgen levels were studied. The results in these women, grouped for analysis on the basis of obesity and ovulatory status, were compared to those in 36 control women of similar ages and weights. The anovulatory hyperandrogenic women had the clinical and biochemical features of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO). Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed with measurement of glucose, insulin, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and total and non-SHBG-bound sex steroid levels. AN was present in 29% of the hyperandrogenic women, the majority of them obese. Fifty percent of obese PCO women had AN, but they did not otherwise differ from PCO women lacking this dermatological change. Only women with PCO had significant hyperinsulinemia independent of obesity, and obese PCO women with AN had the highest serum insulin levels. Plasma glucose values during the oral glucose tolerance test were significantly increased in obese PCO women independent of the presence of AN, and 20% of these women had frank impairment of glucose tolerance. Ovulatory hyperandrogenic women had normal insulin levels and glucose tolerance. Obese and nonobese women had different relationships between sex steroid and insulin levels; obese women had significant correlations between insulin and non-SHBG testosterone levels (r = 0.30; P less than 0.05), whereas nonobese women had significant correlations between insulin and FSH (r = 0.40; P less than 0.01), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (r = 0.33; P less than 0.05), and SHBG (r = 0.37; P less than 0.05) levels, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the association between sex steroid and insulin levels are complex. These findings suggest that 1) only women with PCO have hyperinsulinemia independent of obesity; hyperinsulinemia is not a feature of hyperandrogenic states in general; 2) AN is a common finding in obese hyperandrogenic women, particularly those with PCO; 3) only obese PCO women are at risk for impairment of glucose tolerance, independent of the presence of AN, suggesting that the negative impact of PCO and obesity on insulin action is additive; and 4) PCO women with AN can be considered as a subgroup of PCO and do not appear to have a distinct endocrine disorder.\r"

Immunoreactive and biologically active LH were monitored by radioimmunoassay and the rat interstitial cell testosterone bioassay, respectively. Estradiol infusions significantly suppressed mean plasma bioactive LH concentrations and decreased the bio/immuno LH ratio. Conversely, antiestrogen treatment enhanced spontaneous bioactive LH pulse frequency, increased bioactive LH pulse amplitude, and augmented plasma intrapulse and interpulse bio/immuno LH ratios. Low-dose pulsed injections of exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) also increased plasma bio/immuno LH ratios. However, tamoxifen attenuated the ability of exogenous GnRH to further enhance the bio/immuno LH ratio, which suggests that endogenous LH release was already maximally enriched in LH bioactivity during antiestrogen administration. We conclude that estradiol modulates the pulsatile secretion of LH molecules enriched in biological activity in man.\r"

  ".W": "In perfused pancreas of rats rendered diabetic by streptozotocin injection (STZ) during neonatal age the insulin response to 27 mM glucose was significant but impaired. It was unaffected by the alpha adrenergic blocker phentolamine. When 27 mM mannoheptulose was added simultaneously with 27 mM glucose, insulin release was inhibited, but less promptly than in pancreases from non-diabetic rats. When mannoheptulose was introduced 15 min after starting perfusion with 27 mM glucose, inhibition was apparent in non-diabetic rats, but not in STZ. In non-diabetic rats perfusion without glucose for 40 min failed to affect the subsequent response to 27 mM glucose. Conversely, in STZ, glucose omission enhanced 3.7-fold the response to 27 mM glucose. Insulin release in response to 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) was more marked in STZ than in non-diabetic rats. After glucose omission the IBMX-induced response was, however, reduced (67%) in STZ, but not significantly (7%) in non-diabetic rats. Thus, glucopenia in vitro sensitizes B cells of STZ to glucose, but desensitizes them to IBMX. Abnormal responsiveness may be linked to metabolic consequences of B cell fuel abundance.\r"

  ".U": "87308810\r", 
  ".W": "A new method has been developed for purification of cytochrome b from stimulated human granulocytes offering the advantage of high yields from practical quantities of whole blood. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were treated with diisopropylfluorophosphate, degranulated and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation. Membranes enriched in cytochrome b were prepared by differential centrifugation. Complete solubilization of the cytochrome from the membranes was achieved in octylglucoside after a 1-M salt wash. Wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated Sepharose 4B specifically bound the solubilized cytochrome b and afforded a threefold purification. Eluate from the immobilized wheat germ agglutinin was further enriched by chromatography on immobilized heparin. The final 260-fold purification of the b-type cytochrome with a 20-30% yield was achieved by velocity sedimentation in sucrose density gradients. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the purified preparation revealed two polypeptides of Mr 91,000 and Mr 22,000. Treatment of the 125I-labeled, purified preparation with peptide:N-glycosidase F, which removes N-linked sugars, decreased relative molecular weight of the larger species to approximately 50,000, whereas beta-elimination, which removes O-linked sugars, had little or no effect on the mobility of the Mr-91,000 polypeptide. Neither of the deglycosylation conditions had any effect on electrophoretic mobility of the Mr-22,000 polypeptide. Disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linked the two polypeptides to a new Mr of 120,000-135,000 by SDS-PAGE. Antibody raised to the purified preparation immunoprecipitated spectral activity and, on Western blots, bound to the Mr-22,000 polypeptide but not the Mr-91,000 polypeptide. Western blot analysis of granulocytes from patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease revealed a complete absence of the Mr-22,000 polypeptide. These results (a) suggest that the two polypeptides are in close association and are part of the cytochrome b, (b) provide explanation for the molecular weight discrepancies previously reported for the protein, and (c) further support the involvement of the cytochrome in superoxide production in human neutrophils.\r"

Using an indirect immunofluorescence method, we detected an autoantibody reactive with focal contacts in PtK2, HEp-2, and BHK-21 cells in serum from two patients with early systemic sclerosis. With double immunofluorescence, using the actin-binding drug phalloidin, we localized the plaques decorated by these sera specifically at the termini of microfilament bundles. The reactive antigens were identified by immunoblotting as proteins of 80,000- and 75,300-mol wt in PtK2, and of 53,500-mol wt in HEp-2 and BHK-21 cells. The 53,500-mol wt protein was also identified in rat skeletal, myocardial, and smooth muscle tissues. The detergent solubility of these proteins suggested that they may be linked to the plasma membrane. The autoantigens were immunologically distinct from vinculin and alpha-actinin, two major proteins also known to be concentrated at the ends of microfilament bundles. Our observations suggest that this novel anticytoskeletal autoantibody may identify a novel family of vertebrate cell proteins involved in the linkage of microfilaments to the plasma membrane at focal contacts.\r"

In the lungs, aorta, mesenteric arteries, and adrenal medulla, ACE labeling was highest in the 2K-1C group, intermediate in the 1K-1C and control groups, and lowest in the DOCA-salt group. ACE levels in these tissues correlated positively with PRA. In the kidney, anterior pituitary, testis, and choroid plexus of the brain, ACE levels correlated negatively with PRA, with lowest ACE levels in the 2K-1C group and highest levels in the DOCA-salt group. In the epididymis, posterior pituitary, and other regions of the brain, ACE levels did not differ significantly among the groups.\r"

The alveolar epithelium stained strongly with anti-Ia (HLA-DR) or Leu 10 (HLA-DS) monoclonal antibodies, in eight of nine biopsy specimens from patients with IPF, in three of four biopsy specimens from patients with sarcoidosis, in all six biopsy specimens from patients with presumably viral, mycobacterial, or pneumocystic lung disease, but not in control lung tissue, nor in two biopsy specimens from patients with bacterial pneumonia. Mononuclear cell infiltrates consisted of T4 positive (helper/inducer) lymphocytes, predominantly present in a nodular arrangement in the interstitium, and T8 positive (cytotoxic/suppressor) cells, distributed equally in the interstitium and subepithelially or intraepithelially. T8 cells outnumbered T4 cells in six of nine biopsy specimens from patients with IPF, but in none of the biopsy specimens from patients with sarcoidosis or interstitial lung disease of infectious origin. Although the expression of class II antigens on the alveolar epithelium which is infiltrated by T8 cells in IPF is consistent with local presentation of autoantigens and an ensuing local immune response, class II expression is also present in interstitial lung disease of sarcoidosis and microbial infections: its role in the pathogenesis of IPF must therefore remain speculative.\r"

  ".W": "Two monoclonal antibodies recognising epitopes associated with oestrogen receptor protein were evaluated against the assayable soluble oestrogen receptor concentration in a series of 149 breast carcinomas. One antibody (anti-ER) recognises the hormone binding unit of oestrogen receptor and gives nuclear staining; the other antibody (anti-D5) was raised to a component of soluble oestrogen receptor and gives cytoplasmic staining. To minimise variations attributable to tumour heterogeneity and sampling error immunohistology using the two monoclonal antibodies, radioligand binding assays, enzyme immunoassays, and quantitative histology were done on adjacent frozen sections. Thirty nine per cent, 48%, 54%, and 43% of the tumours were found to be oestrogen receptor positive by radioligand binding assay, anti-ER and anti-D5 immunohistology, and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Strong correlations (p less than 0.0005) were found between anti-ER immunohistology and the radioligand binding assay. Only weak correlations were found between anti-D5 immunohistology and the results of other assay methods for oestrogen receptor. Nuclear staining of human breast cancers with the anti-ER monoclonal antibody thus seems to be an acceptable alternative to biochemical assays, with the additional advantage of showing intercellular and regional heterogeneity for oestrogen receptor content.\r"

A pronounced T lymphoid reaction, mainly of the T helper phenotype, occurred in both lesions. Most of these T cells bore HLA-DR antigens, but only a few of them had the receptor for interleukin 2. The T lymphoid reaction was observed inside the lymphomas in seven of a total of 14 cases, and around the lymphomas in four of the six cases clinically classified as stage I. Perivascular mucosal and submucosal nodules, entirely composed of T cells, seemed characteristic of gastric lymphoid hyperplasias. A T lymphoid reaction in lymphoid hyperplasias suggests an amplification of the cell mediated immune response; in lymphomas it could represent a host reaction against the lymphomatous infiltrate, therefore favouring a better prognosis.\r"

The usual treatment involves surgery or, in many cases, extraction of the resorbed tooth. It is often difficult for the patient to understand and accept such a radical treatment approach. This report of case illustrates severe internal resorption that destroyed a major portion of a key abutment tooth supporting an eight-unit fixed partial denture. The resorptive pathosis was treated by a nonsurgical endodontic approach. The severely damaged abutment was reinforced and restored so that the existing eight-unit fixed partial denture could be preserved. The patient was pleased with the method of treatment and was commended for seeking regular recall professional care. It would have been easy to postpone treatment as the problem was asymptomatic. However, to do so probably would have resulted in loss of the resorbed abutment tooth, thus creating a complex restorative situation. The original prosthesis is currently 14 years old, functioning well, and showing no apparent evidence of pathosis. Costly and time-consuming remake procedures were avoided and patient satisfaction was maintained.\r"

Criteria for selection of patients were (1) clear watery nasal discharge more than 1 hour each day, (2) absent or mild nasal obstruction, (3) no known allergic cause, and (4) no satisfactory response to previous alternative medications. Ipratropium bromide, two sprays (20 micrograms per spray) in each nasal cavity four times daily, for 3 weeks, produced a major reduction in nasal discharge severity and duration (p less than 0.00005 for daytime reduction in both). There was a decreased daily use of nasal tissues (p = 0.0017). At the end of the trial, 21 patients preferred the drug, two preferred placebo, one had no preference, and one patient dropped out for a reason unrelated to symptoms or treatment. This drug preference in favor of active medication was statistically significant at the 0.01 level. Local mild side effects were reported in 21/25 (84%) with ipratropium bromide and 8/25 (32%) with placebo (p = 0.0004). Pulse and blood pressure were not affected. In an ensuing 1-year open trial in which the frequency of use of ipratropium bromide nasal spray was selected by the subjects, the dosage chosen was considerably lower than that used in the controlled trial. There were seven dropouts caused by insufficient benefit or local side effects. Seventeen subjects continued the use of ipratropium bromide for 1 year and reported good results and no side effects. Topical nasal ipratropium bromide is highly effective in the control of the rhinorrhea of vasomotor rhinitis. Drug dosage is a major determinant of local nasal side effects.\r"

  ".U": "87309421\r", 
  ".W": "To establish a safe procedure for examining propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction, we have developed a new method for performing inhalation challenge with propranolol. Monitoring respiratory resistance during tidal breathing with continuous inhalation of propranolol in 1.5-fold increasing concentrations from 0.78 to 30 mg/ml for 1 minute at each concentration, we tested 43 subjects with stable asthma and 10 normal subjects. We also compared bronchial responsiveness with responsiveness to inhaled methacholine on separate days. In addition, to determine the role of vagal nerve activity in propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction, we studied the effect of atropine. Inhaled propranolol caused dose-related bronchoconstriction in all subjects with asthma but not in normal subjects. None of the subjects suffered severe asthmatic attack during the test, which was performed in 15 minutes or less. The minimum cumulative dose of methacholine and of propranolol, at the point where respiratory conductance began to decrease, was not significantly correlated. Increased respiratory resistance was reversed by atropine in 70% of the subjects with asthma with marked individual differences. These data suggest that, although in most subjects with asthma, vagal nerve activity contributes in varying degree to bronchoconstriction, other constricting factors may contribute in the remaining subjects. It is also suggested that the mechanism of bronchial response to propranolol differs from that of the nonspecific airway reactivity estimated by methacholine challenge.\r"

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, before 1920, death from asthma was considered to be rare by many leading authorities. However, asthma mortality rates in young people were stable for a century before the \"epidemic\" of asthma deaths in the latter 1960s. Since then, despite many advances made in our understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and in our ability to treat with newer drugs, deaths from asthma in young patients have not declined and in some areas of the world have indeed increased.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes takes an enormous human and monetary toll each year. Current treatment too often revolves around insulin and drug therapy, neglecting diet and exercise. A comprehensive review was undertaken to assess and summarize the effects of dietary fiber on diabetes. Fiber supplement studies with guar, wheat bran, and apple fiber produced mixed results; some studies reported lowered fasting glucose and cholesterol values and less glycosuria. However, many available fiber supplements cause side effects. High-carbohydrate, high-fiber diets providing 55% to 60% of energy as carbohydrates, 15% to 20% as protein, and 20% to 25% as fat and including 50 gm or more fiber daily hold the most potential for long-term use. These diets reduce insulin requirements, improve glycemic control, lower fasting serum cholesterol and triglyceride values, and promote weight loss. Studies show good long-term adherence with these diets. Dietitians assume primary responsibility for educating individuals on the benefits and use of high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diets. Diets must be individualized, with special modifications for obesity, hyperlipidemia, or physiological states such as pregnancy and lactation. Widespread use of high-fiber diets will ultimately improve metabolic control and decrease health care costs for thousands of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.\r"

Dose-related suppression of basal and stimulated (meal, pentagastrin) gastric acid output has been shown with oral doses of 5-40 mg. The 40 mg dose is associated with the highest inhibitory effect, the longest duration of action, and the greatest response uniformity. After oral administration, antisecretory activity begins within 1 h, reaches a maximum in 1-3 h, and lasts 10-12 h. In addition to the earlier onset of effect, intravenous famotidine is about twice as potent as oral, a result consistent with a systemic bioavailability of oral famotidine of about 43%. Studies in patients and in healthy volunteers have shown that famotidine does not affect cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, pancreatic exocrine, or gastrointestinal motility functions. Oral famotidine is incompletely absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1-3 h. It is eliminated primarily through the kidneys (about 70%), mostly as the parent compound. Its average elimination half-life in healthy subjects is 2.8 h. Half-life is prolonged nonlinearly in patients with decreased renal function. To date, clinically important interactions with other drugs have not been described for famotidine.\r"

Recent advances in technology and microcircuitry have produced lightweight, portable external pacing devices that are less painful to the patient. In an on-going clinical trial of early transcutaneous pacing, five cases were seen in which transcutaneous pacing was begun at the onset of the patients' rhythm disturbance. All five patients survived to leave the hospital. Three of the patients were treated in the prehospital setting. Because of the rapidity with which pacing can be implemented, the ease of application and simplicity of operation, transcutaneous pacing has several advantages over the placing of transvenous pacemakers in the field or emergency department setting. In hemodynamically-compromising bradydysrhythmias unresponsive to pharmacologic intervention, the early use of transcutaneous pacing may improve survival in a group of patients who might otherwise die.\r"

  ".W": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), resulting in an acute bleeding diathesis, is always a secondary complication of an underlying disease. Coagulation triggered by the primary process causes consumption of clotting factors and platelets, and ischemic damage secondary to fibrin deposition. Concurrent activation of the fibrinolytic system results in additional clotting factor consumption and the production of fibrin-degradation products (FDP). The combination of decreased clotting factors, FDP, and thrombocytopenia may ultimately culminate in a bleeding diathesis. The balance between the thrombotic and hemorrhagic processes results in a constellation of signs and symptoms. Diagnosis depends on an awareness of predisposing pathologic states and the application of appropriate laboratory tests. Therapy consists of treating the underlying disease and temporizing with an appropriate replacement therapy. Heparin infusion may be of benefit under certain circumstances. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of DIC, including new laboratory tests and experimental therapy, are reviewed.\r"

W3/25+ T helper (Th) cells in lymph nodes (LN) increased from 7% at 2 wk to 30% at 8 wk after TDL transfer. The percent of W3/25+ cells remained elevated for the life of the recipient (up to 2 yr), approximating normal levels. The total size of the recirculating pool expanded in TDL-injected nude rats to reach 2/3 the level of euthymic controls by 16 wk, an increase of 10-fold to 15-fold in W3/25+ cells. The expansion of the W3/25+ population was independent of initial TDL dose. With time spleen and LN acquired a normal histological appearance including the development of germinal centres and a marked increase in cellularity in T cell traffic areas. TDL-injected nude rats rejected skin allografts with near normal kinetics. In addition graft vs host (GVH) responsiveness, assessed by the popliteal LN assay, progressively increased reaching a level 9 mo to 1 yr after replacement that resembled the GVH activity in euthymic controls.\r"

In this study we investigated the interaction between the autoimmune (lpr) and normal (A-Thy) B, T, and RBC cell lineages in two types of radiation chimeras: MRL/lpr plus A-Thy----(MRL/lpr X A-Thy)F1 and MRL/+ plus A-Thy----(MRL/lpr X A-Thy)F1. Analysis of B cell repopulation by competitive RIA of serum Igh-1 allotype showed that both the MRL and the A-Thy donor cells initially engrafted. However, by 2 to 4 mo post-transplantation the normal A-Thy allotype was barely detectable (reduced greater than 2 orders of magnitude), whereas the autoimmune MRL/lpr allotype persisted at normal levels. Similarly, investigation of the donor origin of peripheral blood T cells by two-color flow cytometry showed that by 8 mo post-transplantation normal A-Thy T cells had been eliminated and only MRL/lpr T cells were present in the circulation. In contrast, erythrocytes from both the MRL/lpr and A-Thy donor strains successfully engrafted the F1 recipients and persisted until the termination of the study. Control chimeras transplanted with a mixture of MRL/+ plus A-Thy BM were stably engrafted with both donor strains in both the erythroid and lymphoid populations. Additional experiments in which either B6/lpr or MRL/lpr (and B6/+ or MRL/+ control) BM cells were transferred into (MRL/lpr X B6/+)F1 and (MRL/lpr X B6/lpr)F1 recipients demonstrated that the development of GVHD was not simply due to increased alloreactivity by the lpr donor cells. In these chimeras only the recipients heterozygous (but not homozygous) for the lpr gene developed lpr-GVHD, although both types of recipients had identical genotypes except at the lpr locus.\r"

Many monoclonal antibodies that bind to human neutrophils react with the oligosaccharide lacto-N-fucopentaose III. Sequential immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled proteins from extracts of neutrophils labeled at the cell surface with 125I, and partial proteolysis peptide mapping studies were used to compare the proteins recognized by several widely used monoclonal antibodies that react with human neutrophils. The monoclonal antibodies that react with lacto-N-fucopentaose III (CD15) immunoprecipitated five distinct neutrophil surface proteins. The data indicate that CD15 monoclonal antibodies react with a subset of the LFA-1/HMac-1/gp 150,95 glycoprotein family as well as with CR1 on human neutrophils. The CD15 antibodies studied differed in their avidities for these proteins. The molecules immunoprecipitated by the CD15 antibodies tested were more resistant to proteolysis than the homologous proteins immunoprecipitated by the other monoclonal antibodies studied that react directly with the alpha M (CD11) or beta (CD18) chains of the LFA-1/HMac-1/gp 150,95 glycoprotein family. Some of the differences in antibody reactivity and protease sensitivity of the membrane proteins recognized by these antibodies may be due to differences in glycosylation. The data suggest that the antibodies studied can detect differences in post-translational modification among copies of certain surface proteins.\r"

The resulting hybrid proteins (LamB-preS2 A and LamB-preS2 B) were normally expressed, stable, and still kept most biologic functions of LamB. The corresponding bacterial strains were used directly as immunogens in rabbits and mice. Both viral sequences were found to be immunogenic in the two animal species. With LamB-preS2 A, antibodies induced were able to react with the viral particles and the immobilized peptide. With LamB-preS2 B, the antibodies raised were not able to recognize the immobilized peptide. However, the results suggest that the B epitope, inserted in LamB, was at least as efficient as the corresponding synthetic peptide in raising antiviral antibodies. Thus, epitope presentation with LamB may present advantages for immunization. We also have shown that peptide A is an essential part of the polymerized human serum albumin receptor. These results, which validate further the LamB vector system for epitope presentation, provide information on the two hepatitis B regions expressed.\r"

The results revealed the existence of at least two distinct repeated overlapping epitopes in the CS protein of P. vivax. Furthermore, polyclonal sera contain antibodies which recognize additional determinants not represented by the synthetic repeat peptides. Some of these sera contain antibodies recognizing a region flanking the repeat domain (region I).

Cellular suppressor mechanisms developing during the induction phase of this phenomenon have recently been shown to be mediated by W3/25+ T cells in an antigen-specific manner. The present study suggests that the late maintenance phase of immunologic enhancement is mediated in vivo by simultaneously present separate donor-specific T cell subpopulations of W3/25+ and OX8+ phenotypes. Splenocyte subsets from grafted recipients greater than 100 days after transplantation were adoptively transferred into unmodified syngeneic LEW rats that received a specific test allograft 24 hr later, or into B recipients bearing indefinitely surviving heart grafts. Test graft survival was prolonged significantly in the first group and not altered in the second. Indeed, nonoverlapping W3/25+ and OX8+ cell fractions were separately responsible for suppression. However, when suppressor activity was tested in vitro in a three-component coculture mixed lymphocyte reaction, no suppression by T cells was obtained; this lack of correlation between in vivo and in vitro results has also been noted by other investigators in different systems. Thus, in the maintenance phase of actively and passively induced immunologic enhancement, interplay between two phenotypically distinct T cells with suppressor characteristics, but not putative cell-surface blocking factors, seems to prevent development of an alloreactive response and mediate host unresponsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "This study confirms our earlier finding that human interleukin (IL)-1 beta exerts an antiviral effect on diploid fibroblasts and on MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. It also extends the observation in that a similar effect was noted on aged but not freshly trypsinized HEp-2 cells, and that not only IL-1 beta but also IL-1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha exerted similar antiviral effects on cells. The antiviral effects of these cytokines were neutralized by addition to the assay system of an antibody that was specific for interferon (IFN)-beta 1, indicating that IFN-beta 1 or a structurally or functionally related substance is involved in the antiviral activity observed. Both IL-1 and TNF were able to induce production of the 26-kDa protein, also known as IFN-beta 2, hybridoma/plasmacytoma growth factor (HPGF) or B-cell stimulatory factor-2 (BSF-2) and previously proposed as an alternative to IFN-beta 1 for mediating the antiviral effect of TNF. However, no good correlation was found between the antiviral effects of TNF and its potential to induce production of the 26-kDa protein. Furthermore, the anti-IFN-beta 1 serum which neutralized the antiviral activity of IL-1 and TNF did not cross-react with the 26-kDa protein. Conversely, the antiviral effect of IL-1 and TNF was only weakly neutralized by an antibody that did react with the 26-kDa protein and showed low cross-reactivity with IFN-beta 1. These observations, together with the low specific activity of the 26-kDa protein as an antiviral agent (less than 10(5) U/mg protein) provide strong arguments against this protein and in favor of IFN-beta 1 (or still another IFN-beta 1-related molecule) as the ultimate mediator of the antiviral effect of IL-1 and TNF.\r"

An increase in C3 synthesis and decrease in albumin synthesis were detected after incubation of Hep 3B cells with fixed stimulated macrophages or with membrane preparations. Estimates of hepatocellular C3 and albumin mRNA indicated that the mIL-1 regulation was exerted at a pretranslational level. The changes in C3 and albumin expression induced by mIL-1 were inhibited by addition of anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1) antiserum to the macrophages, supporting the hypothesis that a form of IL-1 is present on the outer cell membrane of macrophages. Moreover, cell-surface iodination of macrophages allowed the detection of a 33-kDa IL-1 molecule, suggesting that an IL-1 species, similar to the intracellular precursor of IL-1 is present at the outer cell surface of macrophages. The expression of mIL-1 was temporally dissociated from IL-1 release, indicating that the cell-surface associated IL-1 activity is not the result of adsorbed soluble IL-1. These studies provide a basis for further investigation of the role of mIL-1 in modulating monocytes and macrophages function via cell-cell interactions.\r"

  ".W": "The participation of complement receptor type 3 (CR3) in antibody-dependent effector function of human eosinophils against parasites was studied by using monoclonal antibodies directed against various surface molecules. Both adherence and cytotoxicity of hypodense eosinophils to IgE-coated schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni were strongly inhibited by anti-CR3 antibodies (OKM1 or Mo1). The specificity of the inhibitory effect for the alpha-chain of CR3 was shown by the lack of inhibition of anti-beta-chain or anti-LFA1 alpha-chain monoclonal antibodies, although these antigens were expressed on human eosinophils. These results associated to previous works on IgE receptors demonstrate that both receptor for Fc fragments of IgE and CR3 are essential in IgE-dependent cytotoxicity of human eosinophils. Flow microfluorometry analysis revealed that hypodense eosinophils were more intensively stained by OKM1 antibodies than the normodense populations. In the case of IgG-mediated cytotoxicity by normodense eosinophils, only the enhancement of cytotoxicity due to monokine activation was inhibited by anti-CR3 alpha-chain antibodies. These findings suggest an increased expression of CR3 on eosinophils after activation either in vivo or in vitro. The participation of CR3 in IgE-mediated cytotoxicity against schistosomes was also required in the case of blood monocytes but not for platelet-mediated killing, which does not require prior adherence. The biologic role of CR3 is therefore extended to effector mechanisms involving eosinophils and two different isotypes of antibodies and possibly implied in immunity against schistosomes.\r"

  ".W": "The Hodgkin-associated Ki-1 antigen was analyzed in different cell lines. In Hodgkin analogous L428 cells, biosynthetically labeled with radioactive amino acids, the Ki-1 antibody precipitated three glycoproteins with 90, 105, and 120 kDa, respectively. Surface-labeling revealed that the two larger components were membrane-associated forms of the Ki-1 antigen, although the 90-kDa molecule was shown in pulse-chase experiments to be the precursor of the 105- and 120-kDa forms. All three forms of the Ki-1 antigen possess a tunicamycin-sensitive 6-kDa N-linked carbohydrate moiety. O-Linked oligosaccharides could not be detected. Thus, the differences in m.w. are probably not due to glycosylation. The ionophore monensin prevented the appearance of the membrane-associated molecules, which demonstrated that they are assembled between the transcompartment of the Golgi complex and their insertion into the cell membrane. The 90-kDa precursor molecule cannot be generated by disulfide reduction from the two larger forms. After internal labeling with P-32, only the 105- and 120-kDa bands became visible, indicating that the Ki-1 molecule is phosphorylated after its processing into the two larger membrane-associated forms. Analysis of the Ki-1 antigens from other cell lines demonstrated that after external labeling of two other Hodgkin-derived cell lines, six Epstein-Barr virus lymphoblastoid cell lines and one human T leukemia virus I-positive T cell line, both the 105- and the 120-kDa membrane molecules could be detected, regardless of the presence or type of virus integrated.\r"

The significant reject reaction associated with necrosis of the epidermal structures was seen in due time in the animals implanted with allogeneic ECs. We attempted to assess the effect of cyclosporin A (CYA) on skin allograft survival by observing the fate of strain 13 ECs implanted intradermally into the CYA-treated JY-1. Successful prolongation of allograft survival with CYA was clearly demonstrated by this method. This is considered to be a useful experimental way for evaluation of skin allograft survival and to be suitable for routine use.\r"

Twenty-four hours after removing the initially applied agent, a standard suspension of theophylline in PG was applied to the skin surface and the flux of theophylline was determined over the next 48 h. Skin pretreatment with vehicle alone increased theophylline flux 1.6-(EG) to 122-fold (OCT) over control experiments in which the skins were not pretreated. Pretreatment with nonpolar vehicles with lower solubility parameters (OA, OCT, or mixed vehicles containing one of these) had the greatest effect on subsequent theophylline flux. Pretreatment with 5-FU in various vehicles caused a subsequent increased theophylline flux similar to the effect of vehicle alone, except for pretreatment with 5-FU in vehicles which did not have much effect themselves. In those instances, theophylline fluxes up to 16-fold over the effect of those vehicles alone were observed.\r"

This antibody is specific for the 59 kD acidic murine keratin and its 56.5 kD human counterpart (Moll's catalogue #10), and is distinct from the pemphigus antibody system. Antikeratin autoantibodies present in the Cascas-42 serum were purified by affinity chromatography with a 59 kD murine keratin-agarose column (IAP-Cascas-42 antibodies). The specificity of the IAP-Cascas-42 antibodies was tested by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy against epidermal cryosections, trypsin-dissociated keratinocytes, and epidermal cell cultures. The serum was also tested with extracts from unlabeled and surface 125I-labeled keratinocytes (Iodo-Gen method) by immunoblot analysis of one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The IAP-Cascas-42 antibodies bind the intercellular spaces of murine epidermis, and the cell surfaces of viable, dissociated murine keratinocytes, as well as murine epidermal cells in culture by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. These autoantibodies did not stain cytoplasmic keratins and did not react with parallel human epidermal substrates. The Cascas-42 serum identified the 59 kD murine acidic keratin and its 56.5 kD human counterpart in epidermal extracts by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. In addition, surface radioiodination of viable murine keratinocytes selectively labeled the 59 kD keratin suggesting that a domain of this molecule is exposed on the cell surface. The 125I-labeled 59 kD keratin was also recognized by the Cascas-42 serum by immunoblotting and autoradiography. These studies suggest that in murine epidermis, the 59 kD keratin is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain recognized by the IAP-Cascas-42 antibodies.\r"

Fungal adherence differs from bacterial adherence, especially when fungal coadherence (adherence of fungal cells to each other) is a factor. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured in a living monolayer in microtiter plates, we developed an ELISA to study adherence of Candida albicans to endothelial cells in the absence of yeast coadherence. A rabbit antibody to Candida detected the adherent Candida, and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody to rabbit IgG was the developing antibody. A linear relationship between the log of the optical density and the log of the number of adherent organisms was seen for wells containing 3 X 10(4)-1 X 10(6) organisms (r = .923- .965). In addition to measuring adherence of living Candida to living target cells and avoiding Candida coadherence, this assay makes it possible to investigate adherence limited to lumenal surfaces, conserves reagents, and facilitates the testing of large numbers of potential adherence modifiers.\r"

P fimbriae were found in 17 urine samples and in 18 of the isolated strains. Type-1-fimbriate bacteria were detected in only nine urine samples, although 18 of the isolated strains expressed type-1 fimbriae after growth in vitro. Four strains possessed type-1C fimbriae; only two expressed type-1C fimbriae in urine. The bacterial populations in urine were heterogeneous, and in each positive staining, only a fraction of the bacterial cells were reactive. The results show that E. coli P fimbriae are expressed and are subject to phase variation in vivo during acute urinary tract infection.\r"

Two stable monoclonal cell lines, derived from the same parent culture, were established and produced antibodies of the IgG isotype that were specific for the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg). Both monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognized the major HDAg polypeptides of 24 kilodaltons and 27 kilodaltons that were previously detected by polyclonal antibodies to HDAg in both liver and serum from HDV-infected humans, chimpanzees, and woodchucks. This result indicates that the major polypeptides of HDAg share common epitopes. The MAbs also reacted with minor polypeptides of lower molecular weight, which were present in infected liver. In vitro translation products of HDV-specific RNA from infected liver were also detected by the MAbs; these polypeptides were 24 kilodaltons and 27 kilodaltons, respectively, and comigrated with liver- or serum-derived HDAg. In contrast, HDV RNA isolated from virions in serum was not translated into HDAg polypeptides in the in vitro system.\r"

Patients booked with family physicians experienced fewer artificial rupture of membranes, inductions of labor, episiotomies, and forceps deliveries than those booked with obstetricians. These patients also spent a shorter time in hospital in spite of longer second stages of labor. Infant outcomes were equivalent in the two groups. A simple method of audit of maternity care that permits comparisons of the care provided by family physicians and obstetricians for obstetrically similar patients is described. This methodology employs matching within a given institution and facilitates the multicentered studies required to obtain the large populations needed to compare the process and outcome of infant and maternal care provided by these two types of physicians.\r"

Important causes of this problem include endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, and the syndrome of chronic pelvic pain without obvious pathology. The diagnostic approach to chronic pelvic pain begins with a careful medical history and physical examination in conjunction with a comprehensive psychosocial assessment. Laboratory evaluation may include pelvic ultrasonography, psychometric testing, and diagnostic laparoscopy. Optimal management of these patients may require a multidisciplinary approach, integrating chronic pain management techniques with specific therapy.\r"

All of the antibodies labeled some neurites in some SP. The transmitter specificities of immunoreactive neurites tended to reflect the distribution of transmitter-associated fibers in normal tissue. This investigation also documented the presence of abnormal axons (as distinct from neurites within plaques) in the neuropil in brains of individuals with AD and in some aged controls. These findings suggest that a variety of transmitter systems are involved in the formation of neuropil abnormalities of SP. They also indicate that a greater number of neuronal systems are affected in AD than have been documented by neurochemical studies.\r"

Toxicity of this regimen was tolerable, principally marked by bone marrow depression and gastrointestinal (GI) tract complications. Four complication-related deaths were observed. Relapse post-ABMT occurred most often in the bone marrow. Under this treatment, actuarial disease-free survival is improved compared with that observed under conventional therapy.\r"

We reviewed the light microscopic specimens from 113 patients with PDC in an attempt to identify common histopathologic features in the chemotherapy-responsive subgroup, and to rule out the presence of previously unrecognized germ cell tumors. Relatively few diagnoses more specific than PDC could be made. We could identify no histopathologic features by light microscopy that distinguished responsive from unresponsive neoplasms. Only one patient was found to have a previously unrecognized yolk sac carcinoma, and in five other patients the possibility of a germ cell neoplasm was considered in the differential diagnosis by at least one reviewer. The remaining tumors had no histologic features suggestive of germ cell neoplasms. Ninety-six patients had received combination chemotherapy (89 with cisplatin-containing regimens); 27 patients (28%) achieved complete remission, and 16 remain free of disease at a median of 65 months after completion of therapy. Patients with PDC of unknown primary site who are responsive to cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens cannot be reliably identified by light microscopy. At present, all such patients should be considered for an empiric trial of chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens, since cure is achievable in a minority.\r"

  ".U": "87310572\r", 
  ".W": "Cisplatin (NSC 119875) and carboplatin (NSC 241240) are platinum (II) analogues with very different spectra of toxicity. Cisplatin dose is limited by nausea and vomiting, renal dysfunction, and dose-related peripheral neuropathy, whereas carboplatin is myelosuppressive. There are also clinical and laboratory data that suggest that these drugs may not be completely cross-resistant. Therefore, the following phase I trial of combination therapy with cisplatin and carboplatin was undertaken. Since carboplatin toxicity is enhanced in the presence of renal impairment, carboplatin excretion was also evaluated in selected patients at the maximum tolerated dose. Thirty-three patients received 50 mg/m2 cisplatin and doses of carboplatin between 160 mg/m2 and 400 mg/m2. Sequential 20-minute infusions of carboplatin and then cisplatin were able to be administered at the standard doses of carboplatin (320 and 400 mg/m2) with thrombocytopenia to the degree expected if carboplatin alone had been given. However, 280 mg/m2 carboplatin followed by 25 mg/m2 cisplatin/d X 3 caused unexpectedly severe thrombocytopenia in seven of eight patients (median platelet nadir 45,000/microL; range, 12 to 321,000/microL; nadir was less than 90,000 in seven of eight patients). In three patients treated with 280 mg/m2 carboplatin plus 25 mg/m2/d X 3 cisplatin, pharmacokinetics of carboplatin were compared during consecutive monthly cycles without and with cisplatin. Modestly increased areas under the curve (AUC) for carboplatin (15% and 35%) with cisplatin were seen in the two patients who experienced more pronounced platelet suppression with combination therapy. No other limiting or unusual toxicity was seen with this combination. Responses, primarily in \"platinum responsive\" tumors, were seen. The combination of cisplatin plus carboplatin is feasible and merits further study.\r"

Chemotherapy regimens consisted of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and doxorubicin (Adriamycin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (COPA) administered in 3-week cycles; cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin plus prednisone beginning day 1, with vincristine plus bleomycin day 15 of each 3-week cycle (COPA + Bleo); or cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin plus procarbazine beginning day 1, and bleomycin plus vincristine plus prednisone beginning day 15 of each 4-week cycle (CAP-BOP). The median patient follow-up from study entry for patients still alive is 5 years. The three regimens were not significantly different with respect to complete response (CR) rates (43% to 46%), time to progression of malignant disease (median, 1.0 to 1.7 years), or survival (5-year survival, 34% to 45%), although duration of complete remission appeared to be shorter in patients receiving COPA (P = .03). COPA + Bleo and CAP-BOP were significantly more toxic than the COPA regimen. This study did not demonstrate any substantial therapeutic advantage associated with the addition of a fifth or sixth chemotherapy drug, or with treatment administered on a more frequent administration schedule, compared with the COPA regimen in this population of patients with advanced diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The relatively small proportion of long-term disease-free survivors treated with COPA underscores the need for prospective clinical trials of new and more effective treatments for patients with these potentially curable tumors.\r"

Twenty-eight of the 100 are alive and the actuarial probability of disease-free survival 5 years from transplantation is 22%. The most common reason for treatment failure was disease recurrence, with an actuarial probability of 60%. A proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the likelihood of disease-free survival was less in those patients transplanted in resistant relapse and in those previously treated with chest radiotherapy. Neither disease histology (Hodgkin's disease, high-grade lymphoma or intermediate-grade lymphoma), nor source of marrow (syngeneic, allogeneic, or autologous) significantly influenced either disease-free survival or probability of relapse. The use of high-dose chemoradiotherapy and marrow transplantation appears to offer a better chance for long-term survival than any other form of therapy for young patients with disseminated malignant lymphoma whose disease has progressed after initial combination chemotherapy. The best results with marrow transplantation were obtained in patients transplanted in early relapse or second remission who had not received prior chest radiotherapy.\r"

As of March 1987, the median follow-up is more than 3 1/2 years. Thirteen patients are alive (11 relapse free) between 2 and 4 1/2 years post-BMT. Neither age, sex, remission number, prior extramedullary leukemia, nor WBC at diagnosis of ALL was statistically significant as a predictor of relapse-free survival. The development of acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) in 17 patients was found, with time-dependent Cox regression analysis, to be associated with a significant reduction in post-BMT relapse risk (P = .04) and improved disease-free survival (P = .11). A prospective, randomized trial of maintenance chemotherapy with oral methotrexate and mercaptopurine did not demonstrate improvement in relapse risk or survival for those assigned maintenance chemotherapy (P = .7). These results suggest that allogeneic BMT can result in extended relapse-free survival for some patients with high-risk ALL. More effective preparative chemoradiotherapy and exploitation of the apparent graft-v-leukemia effect may be useful in future trials.\r"

  ".W": "In order to assess the effect of scheduling of chemotherapy on the outcome of patients with limited small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), the Clinical Trials Group of the National Cancer Institute of Canada carried out a randomized trial comparing the alternation of cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH; doxorubicin) and vincristine (CAV) with etoposide (VP-16) and cisplatin for six cycles to the administration of these two combinations in a sequential fashion (three cycles of CAV followed by three of VP-16/cisplatin). Three hundred eligible patients were enrolled on the trial from September 1981 to October 1984. All responding patients were also treated after completion of chemotherapy with thoracic irradiation in randomly allocated doses of 2,000 and 3,750 cGy. The complete response (CR) rate to chemotherapy was slightly, but not significantly, higher on the alternating arm (52% v 44%, P = .20). However, there was no difference in disease-free or overall survival on the alternating and sequential arms, respectively (47.3 weeks v 45.1 weeks, P = .26; 61.7 weeks v 59.5 weeks, P = .56). Data on the effect of radiotherapy dose on survival are not yet mature, but it does not appear the results of this portion of the trial will alter the interpretation of the chemotherapy comparison. Patient characteristics favorably influencing survival were female sex, good performance status, younger age, and absence of supraclavicular node involvement. Two interpretations of these and other results in SCLC are suggested: (1) the difference between the schedules used is too small for the predictions of the Goldie-Coldman model to be realized in a trial of this size, or (2) VP-16/cisplatin is actually a superior regimen and any schedule that exposes patients to these drugs early in treatment will produce improved results.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1978 and 1984, the Northern California Oncology Group (NCOG) conducted a randomized trial to study the efficacy of combined radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) for stage III or IV inoperable head and neck cancer. One hundred four patients were randomized to receive: (1) RT alone, or (2) RT plus CT. RT consisted of 7,000 cGy to the involved areas and 5,000 cGy to uninvolved neck at 180 cGy/fraction, five fractions/wk. CT consisted of bleomycin, 5 U intravenously (IV), twice weekly during RT, followed by bleomycin, 15 U IV, and methotrexate, 25 mg/m2 IV weekly for 16 weeks after completion of RT. Fifty-one patients in the RT alone group and 45 in the combined treatment group were evaluable. The local-regional complete response (CR) rate was 45% v 67% (P = .056); the 2-year local-regional control rate, including salvage surgery, was 26% v 64% (P = .001); and the incidence of distant metastasis was 24% v 38% (P greater than .25), for the RT alone and RT plus CT groups, respectively. The relapse-free survival curves were significantly different (P = .041), favoring the combined treatment. However, the survival curves were not significantly different (P = .16). Patient compliance to maintenance CT was poor. Bleomycin significantly increased the acute radiation mucositis, although the difference in late normal tissue toxicity was not statistically significant. Thus, bleomycin and concurrent RT produced a more favorable CR rate, local-regional control rate, and relapse-free survival, but the difference in survival was not statistically significant.\r"

In every patient with RVH, captopril induced, enhanced or sustained abnormal findings on HIP scintigraphy depending on the degree of RAS. With DTPA scintigraphy, renal function decreased after captopril in ten kidneys with RVH-related RAS and adequate baseline renal function, but this phenomenon was not evident in 11 kidneys with RVH and poor renal function. Captopril did not influence HIP or DTPA studies of kidneys with patent renal arteries (patients after successful renal angioplasty, patients with essential hypertension, contralateral kidneys of patients with unilateral RVH) or ipsilateral kidneys with mild and subcritical (less than 60%) RAS in patients without hypertension and/or normal renal vein renin activity. When HIP and DTPA scintigraphy were compared in the same patients, HIP demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity than DTPA, particularly in patients with poor renal function. HIP scintigraphy before and after a single dose of captopril may provide a rapid sensitive and minimally invasive test for screening patients with hypertension.\r"

Individual kidney and total ERPF were determined from gamma camera (GC) methods using renal uptake 1-2 min after injection. All methods were compared against Method I (previously validated against paraaminohippurate (PAH) clearances). Method II, which requires one blood sample is more accurate than GC methods. GC methods are insensitive to operator variability in placement of renal and BG regions of interest. They may be useful to follow changes in relative or total ERPF, but accurate depth correction of renal data is suggested. In vitro, blood sample-based methods are more accurate.\r"

A study by a MIRD task group, McAfee et al. 1979 (1), measured the biologic distribution of [99mTc]DTPA(Sn) in most body tissues but omitted bone, which we believe is a major contributor to this initial \"plateau\". Using MIRD criteria, measurements were carried out on rabbit humeri and these were compared with results obtained from human subjects. It would appear that initial accumulation of the compound by interstitial bone is the reason for the \"plateau\" and explains why blood sampling for GFR studies should not be undertaken over the first 2 hr. In addition, the results of this study provide valuable information relevant to bone perfusion studies and the biologic distribution and concentration of i.v. administered drugs during the first 2 hr postinjection.\r"

Concurrent head computed tomography (CT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cerebral angiographic studies were negative. Abnormalities demonstrated by [123I]HPDM imaging and by EEG may represent changes in neurophysiological and neurochemical status while cerebral angiography, CT, and possibly NMR register only anatomic or structural lesions. Premortem diagnosis of CJD depends on brain biopsy; the availability of the [123I] HIPDM study may provide regional cerebral neurochemical and neurophysiological information, guiding or avoiding brain biopsy in the appropriate clinical setting.\r"

  ".U": "87310724\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium absorption from the intestine involves two sets of events. One, a saturable transcellular process is regulated by vitamin D via its molecular product, the calcium-binding protein (CaBP, MW = 8800). This transcellular movement is largely confined to the proximal portion of the intestine. The second process is nonsaturable, occurs throughout the length of the intestine and is paracellular. Evidence in support of these statements is discussed, with emphasis on kinetic considerations. It is proposed that CaBP acts as a ferry, amplifying the intracellular movement of calcium by a factor of about 60, thereby enabling transcellular calcium transport to reach the measured values of Vm = 22 mumol/h per gram (wet) duodenum, with Km = 3.9 mM. The transcellular process is subject to down-regulation and is influenced by functional or nutritional factors such as age or calcium intake. The nonsaturable process, on the other hand, is not directly influenced by these or related events. Vitamin D therapy alters active calcium transport, but may lead to undesirable effects at other target organs, e.g., kidney or bone. An increase in calcium intake is the simplest method for increasing the amount absorbed. Future research may show whether paracellular pathway alterations are a practical approach to changing the amount of calcium absorbed by the nonsaturable process.\r"

Plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol did not change in L, but had decreased in ML to 51 +/- 8 and 81 +/- 8% of the initial values, respectively, at the end of this period; the largest decreases already occurred during the first 8 wk. HDL cholesterol of both L and ML were not affected. After 16 wk, postprandial responses of plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and glucose and insulin, determined at hourly intervals during the first 8 h postfeeding, did not show any differences for the two dietary groups. In spite of a marked replacement of n-6 fatty acids by n-3 fatty acids in cardiac sarcolemmal membranes in ML, there were no major differences in cardiovascular performance (myocardial contractility, pre- and afterload, cardiac output and myocardial work) between L and ML, when measured under baseline conditions and after the heart was stressed by atrial pacing (heart rate: 160 beats/min). In conclusion, feeding moderate amounts of mackerel oil [0.3 g 20:5 n-3/(kg body weight.d)] to pigs during 16 wk produces decreases of the plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride, but does not affect plasma HDL cholesterol and routine cardiovascular parameters.\r"

The ridges augmented with only porous particles of HA demonstrated a greater amount of bone ingrowth compared with the solid, dense particles.

The addition of autogenous bone to the HA particles did not enhance bony deposition, and none of the autogenous bone chips survived for 24 weeks.

Their gestational age (mean +/- SD) was 28.5 +/- 3.4 weeks, and postnatal age at the time of study 19.5 +/- 10.7 weeks. The infants were randomized to two groups. Group 1 received successively placebo, theophylline, and theophylline plus diuretics; Group 2 received theophylline, placebo, and placebo plus diuretics on successive 4-day periods. Pulmonary function was measured before beginning the study (baseline) and at the end of each 4-day period. No significant changes in pulmonary function were noted after treatment with placebo. After treatment with theophylline, dynamic compliance (Cdyn) increased from baseline (mean +/- SD) 0.075 +/- 0.017 to 0.091 +/- 0.028 mL/cm H2O/cm (P less than 0.01), airway resistance (Raw) decreased from 67.19 +/- 36.71 to 41.44 +/- 22.50 cm H2O/L/sec (P less than 0.001), maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC) increased from 0.261 +/- 0.240 to 0.357 +/- 0.299 thoracic gas volume (TGV)/sec (P less than 0.01), and time constant decreased from 0.312 +/- 0.224 to 0.275 +/- 0.247 sec (P less than 0.02). After treatment with combined placebo and diuretics, Cdyn increased to 0.103 +/- 0.023 mL/cm H2O/cm (P less than 0.05), Raw decreased to 31.76 +/- 24.90 cm H2O/L/sec (P less than 0.001), VmaxFRC increased to 0.638 +/- 0.595 TGV/sec (P less than 0.02), and time constant decreased to 0.180 +/- 0.141 sec (P less than 0.05). After treatment with combined theophylline and diuretics, Cdyn increased to 0.118 +/- 0.017 mL/cm H2O/cm (P less than 0.001), Raw decreased to 35.98 +/- 25.85 cm H2O/L/sec (P less than 0.02), VmaxFRC increased to 0.479 +/- 0.377 TGV/sec (P less than 0.02), and time constant decreased to 0.180 +/- 0.137 sec (P less than 0.01).

A rapid progression of the HAIR-AN syndrome was apparent during the peripubertal period and early reproductive years. Beyond this period, the progression of HAIR-AN appeared quite variable. Rapid weight gain was a major stimulant for increasing insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia. In the one subject with a postmenarcheal onset of the syndrome, prolonged weight reduction was associated with an improvement in the dermatologic manifestation as well as in the hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. Oral contraceptives appear to improve the dermatologic symptoms of the HAIR-AN syndrome.\r"

In our study of 109 patients with diabetes, a higher prevalence of Dupuytren's contracture was found compared to nondiabetic subjects, but the difference was not statistically significant (p less than 0.1). An association between limited joint mobility and Dupuytren's contracture was shown. Patients with diabetes with Dupuytren's contracture showed no difference compared to those without Dupuytren's contracture with regard to sex, insulin dosage, metabolic control and presence of shoulder capsulitis. Limited joint mobility and Dupuytren's contracture may be associated with retinopathy.\r"

We have demonstrated that chondrocytes in osteoarthritic cartilage synthesize proteoglycans which have the same functional characteristics as those of normal cartilage. Osteoarthritic cartilage contains metallodependent proteoglycan degrading enzymes, in both active and latent forms. These enzymes degrade both synthesized and endogenous proteoglycan macromolecules, as indicated by the reduced hydrodynamic size found in both proteoglycan populations in osteoarthritic cartilage treated with APMA. Our results also suggest the possibility that proteolytic degradation can occur at both the hyaluronate-binding region and in the chondroitin-sulfate-rich region of the proteoglycan core protein.\r"

  ".W": "The destruction of articular cartilage is a hallmark of osteoarthritis. In this process, cartilage fibrillation and eventual erosive lesions result from altered biomechanics generally thought to be preceded by alterations in the cartilage extracellular matrix. The irreversible cartilage changes are, in part, mediated by elevated proteolytic activities of acid and neutral metalloproteases that degrade proteoglycan and Type II collagen. Interestingly, an identical enzyme class is believed to participate in normal turnover of these extracellular matrix constituents. Thus, the control of synovial and cartilage protease activation has become of paramount importance in understanding the role these enzymes play in osteoarthritic pathology.\r"

In osteoarthritic cartilage, levels of the 2 metalloproteases increase 3-fold or more, while the level of TIMP remains constant.

Cytokines derived from T lymphocytes and monocytes have a capacity to: a) cause qualitative changes in and reversibly suppress chondrocyte proteoglycan, collagen, and non-collagen protein synthesis, and b) induce the synthesis and release of chondrocyte proteinases.

Since local tumor extension has a considerable impact on the operation strategy evaluation of the T classification was of particular interest. All 4 diagnostic procedures were performed in 73 of the 225 patients. The T stage was determined correctly by ultrasonography in 77.8 per cent of the patients, while the tumor was not identifiable in only 0.6 per cent. Computerized tomography was almost as reliable as ultrasonography (the T stage was predicted correctly in 72.3 per cent of the examinations). In contrast, the tumor was staged correctly by angiography in only 57.2 per cent of the patients and by excretory urography in only 59.2 per cent. From these results ultrasonography appears to be an effective, noninvasive, inexpensive and safe procedure to evaluate the T stage of renal tumors.\r"

Pathogenetic theories concerning defects in the epithelium and/or mucous surface coat (including glycosaminoglycans) of the bladder, and theories concerning immunological disturbances predominate. Sodium pentosanpolysulfate (Elmiron) acts by substituting a defective glycosaminoglycan layer and inhibits complement reactions in inflammatory processes. We compared sodium pentosanpolysulfate versus placebo in a prospective double-blind, clinically controlled multicenter trial of 115 patients with painful bladder disease. Two protocols were used. Protocol A included 43 patients with clinically and pathologically anatomically verified interstitial cystitis (28 or more mast cells per mm.2), and protocol B included 72 patients with a painful bladder and unspecific histological findings. The patients were randomized to receive either sodium pentosanpolysulfate (200 mg. twice daily) or placebo capsules for 4 months. Before and after the trial the patients were evaluated with symptom grading, urodynamics and cystoscopy with distension and deep bladder biopsies. The results showed no difference between the pre-trial and post-trial values in the sodium pentosanpolysulfate and placebo groups in both protocols in regard to symptoms, urodynamic parameters, cystoscopic appearance and mast cell counts. A significant increase in the cystoscopically determined bladder capacity in the sodium pentosanpolysulfate group in protocol A was found. We conclude that no statistically or clinically significant effect of sodium pentosanpolysulfate was found compared to placebo in patients with painful bladder disease.\r"

Patient selection was based on the typical chronic symptomatology but the material subsequently was stratified according to objective cystoscopic findings. The medication (400 mg. daily in 2 oral doses) was discontinued after 6 months. The response was evaluated every 4 weeks during treatment and every 3 months thereafter. Most patients responded favorably, many with diminution of pain within only 4 weeks from the start of treatment. The frequency of micturition decreased significantly and the mean volume per void per 24 hours increased in the patients without bladder ulceration but such changes were not found in the patients with ulcer. The bladder capacity was smaller in the ulcer group. In these patients the pre-treatment intensity of pain was somewhat greater than in those without bladder ulcer but the pain was alleviated in both groups and this effect was stable at the 3-month followup. The differences in responses in the 2 groups indicate a probable fundamental difference between ulcerative and nonulcerative interstitial cystitis. Side effects of the drug were few, slight and transient. Therefore, the study indicates that a significant number of patients with interstitial cystitis can be expected to benefit from treatment with sodium pentosanpolysulfate.\r"

The cytological diagnosis of the aspirate was compared to the pathological diagnosis obtained at prostatectomy in all patients.

Sufficient aspirate material for cytological diagnosis was obtained in 98 of 102 men (96 per cent), including 17 with a diagnosis of carcinoma.

  ".W": "Nucleoli isolated from HeLa S3 cells were used to produce rabbit antisera capable of binding nucleoli of transitional cell carcinomas (TCCa) of the bladder. Cross-reactivity of the rabbit antiserum with normal nucleoli was reduced by absorption with fetal calf serum, normal human serum, and human placental nucleoli. This antinucleolar antiserum exhibited strong reactivity in immunoperoxidase assays performed on specimens of human bladder cancer. In frozen tissue sections of 24 patients with TCCa and eight individuals without tumor, nucleolar staining was observed in all malignant specimens, but was not observed in seven of the normal specimens. Cytologic examination of bladder washing specimens from 47 normal individuals showed absence of nucleolar staining in 43 (91%) of 47 normal specimens while 12 (86%) of 14 specimens from patients with TCCa were positive. These results suggest that there are antigens associated with the nucleoli of HeLa cells and transitional cell carcinomas which are generally absent (or in low concentration) in normal human urothelial cells, and that antisera to these antigens may be useful in the cytologic diagnosis of human transitional cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Suprarenal extension of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has been reported to be present in less than 10% of patients. Its preoperative demonstration is of value in planning the aneurysm repair; however, the most appropriate radiologic method of assessment remains controversial. Although many practitioners advocate angiography, recent advances in noninvasive techniques challenge this approach. To determine the optimal method of assessment, a retrospective study of CT, ultrasonography, and angiography was undertaken in a group of 101 patients with AAA. Conventional CT was used in all patients and high-resolution CT through the region of the renal vein was used in 45 of these patients. Ultrasonography was used in 27 patients and angiography in 23. Conventional CT detected the renal artery origins in 76% of the cases--results that improved to 98% when thin-section high-resolution CT was used. These improvements in CT make the delineation of the relationship of the renal arteries to the aortic aneurysms almost as accurate as angiography at approximately half the cost. Its accuracy, safety, and cost effectiveness make CT the modality of choice in the preoperative assessment of suprarenal aortic aneurysms.\r"

  ".W": "The National Association of Public Hospitals and the Association of American Medical Colleges' Council of Teaching Hospitals conducted a detailed survey on hospital care to patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in major US public and private teaching institutions in 1985. The 169 hospitals treating patients with AIDS that responded to the survey reported providing inpatient services to 5393 patients with AIDS. These patients accounted for 171,205 inpatient days and 8806 inpatient admissions, with an average length of stay of 19 days. The average costs and revenue for patients with AIDS per day were $635 and $482, respectively, with Medicaid representing the most frequent third-party payer. The average inpatient cost per patient per year was $20,320. Using Centers for Disease Control estimates of 18,720 patients diagnosed as having AIDS and alive during any part of 1985, we estimate that the total cost of inpatient care for patients with AIDS was $380 million for that year. We also found significant regional and ownership differences in source of payment for patients with AIDS and regional differences in revenues received for AIDS treatment. Results indicate that the costs of treating patients with AIDS will profoundly affect major public and private teaching institutions, but that public teaching hospitals in states with restrictive Medicaid programs will be most adversely affected.\r"

This report is the first in a series of reports prepared by a multidisciplinary panel appointed by the Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Association. It discusses the necessity for proper clinical trials to generate reproducible results under similar conditions to adequately prove the validity of various diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In vivo immunologic tests have been shown to be reliable and valid diagnostic tools and include skin tests with standardized allergenic extracts by prick, puncture, and intradermal techniques, skin end-point titration, and patch testing for contact allergic dermatitis. Other clinically useful physiologic tests include the exercise tolerance test, methacholine and/or histamine inhalation challenge test, and other inhalation tests utilizing either nasal or bronchial delivery. Oral challenge testing has also been utilized and includes open, single-blind, or double-blind techniques, depending on the requirements of the patient being studied. The second article is a continuation of the first report, and describes other challenge tests and unproved procedures. The third report of this series evaluates in vitro tests for allergy.\r"

The value of provocation-neutralization procedures has been controversial; two promising clinical models have been developed that may allow definitive trials of efficacy. Immunotherapy with allergenic extracts has been shown to be a safe and effective procedure in carefully selected patients treated with potent, well-standardized antigens administered in adequate dosage. It has been proposed that many nonspecific signs or symptoms could be caused by exposure to Candida albicans or low-dose environmental substances. The cause-and-effect relationships between exposure to C albicans or other environmental substances and the disorders that are alleged to be associated with them are, for the most part, unproved.\r"

Serial skin biopsy specimens were obtained before therapy (baseline), during IL-2 administration, and during IL-2/lymphokine-activated killer cell infusion. All patients developed an eruption that was characterized by macular erythema, with burning and pruritus of the skin. It began after two or three days of IL-2 infusion and was usually localized to the head and neck; it occasionally became generalized (ie, erythroderma). The eruption resolved with desquamation within 48 to 72 hours after cessation of infusion of IL-2. Histologically, the changes were not specific. The only consistent immunohistological finding noted was the presence of DR+/Leu-4+ lymphoid cells surrounding blood vessels in the papillary dermis, with fewer of these cells in the epidermis. There was no difference between the clinical or histological features of the eruption that occurred with IL-2 alone and that which occurred with IL-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell infusion, suggesting that the cutaneous effects were mediated by IL-2 alone.\r"
