  ".W": "A review of endoscopic records at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation over a 7-yr period yielded 72 cases of Barrett's esophagus. Ten patients had adenocarcinoma at the time of diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (14%). Sixty-two were followed for a mean of 31 months (range 2-154 months). During this follow-up period, cancer developed in one patient, an incidence of one cancer per 166 patient yr and an annual incidence of 0.6%. Males predominated in the group with both Barrett's esophagus (55 of 72) and adenocarcinoma (10 of 11). Symptoms were similar in those with simple Barrett's esophagus and those complicated by cancer. Our findings on incidence of cancer in Barrett's was applied to a model surveillance program. The cost of yearly endoscopic surveillance is estimated to be +62,000 and 78 lost work days to discover one cancer during the follow-up period. An endoscopic surveillance program requiring every-other-year studies appears justified and would cost only half as much, annually.\r"

  ".W": "Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) can be considered a primary factor required in vitro and in vivo for inducing endocellular lysis of microorganisms by peritoneal macrophages (PM luminal diameter), an essential activity in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients that prevents bacterial peritonitis. In 22 uremic patients treated with CAPD we analyzed: (1) the amount of IFN-gamma released by elicited peritoneal lymphocytes (PL); (2) oxidative metabolism and microbicidal activity by elicited PM luminal diameter; (3) immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc-receptor expression on PM luminal diameter membrane; (4) the effect on PM luminal diameter hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, bactericidal activity, and IgG Fc-receptor expression exerted in vitro by human recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma). Results demonstrate that IFN-gamma release by elicited PL is lower in some CAPD patients with high peritonitis incidence (HPI) than in healthy donors or in CAPD patients with low peritonitis incidence (LPI). Simultaneously, PM luminal diameter from CAPD patients with HPI are characterized by a decreased ability to generate oxygen metabolites, to kill bacteria, and by a lack in IgG Fc-receptor expression; these defects were completely cured after being treated with rIFN-gamma. These results show that the IFN-gamma treatment in vitro could strengthen PM luminal diameter phagocytosis, oxygen metabolite generation, and bacterial killing in CAPD patients with HPI, and suggest that IFN-gamma may be considered a possible therapy in vivo for these patients.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed biochemical data derived from 911 patients with renal insufficiency observed at our institution for periods up to 7 years. During early renal failure (RF) (creatinine less than 5 mg/dL), the rate of change of hematocrit, total CO2 (tCO2) and urea per unit change of creatinine was significantly higher than during moderate (creatinine between 5 and 10 mg/dL) or advanced (creatinine greater than 10 mg/dL) RF. For example, the rate of change of hematocrit (%, volume/volume [v/v]) was (mean +/- SEM) -2.15 +/- 0.15% for each 1 mg/dL increase in creatinine in the range of creatinine less than 5 mg/dL, whereas for the range of creatinine greater than 10 mg/dL, the rate of change was only -0.48 +/- 0.06% (P less than 0.001). Similarly, the rate of change of tCO2 was -1.68 +/- 0.09 mEq/L for each 1 mg/dL increment in creatinine concentration during early RF, and -0.19 +/- 0.09 mEq/L per unit increase in creatinine during advanced RF (P less than 0.001). Chloride concentration initially increased as a function of creatinine in early RF, but decreased in advanced RF, whereas the anion gap increased throughout the course of RF. Mean serum phosphate concentration also increased steadily, but remained below the upper range of normal (4.7 mg/dL) during early RF without the use of phosphate binders. These data suggest that different biochemical parameters change at different rates as a function of the severity of renal dysfunction, and that although phosphate retention may occur, hyperphosphatemia is not a hallmark of early RF.\r"

When the same samples were reanalyzed after protein removal by sulfosalicylic acid precipitation, ultrafiltration, or more extensive dilution, the measured serum inorganic phosphate levels were invariably normal. The addition of human globulin (but not albumin), to pooled normal sera, caused an increase in serum inorganic phosphate levels as measured by the discrete analyzer. The increase correlated with the amount of globulin added (r = 0.72, P less than 0.05), but measured levels did not reach those observed in the hyperphosphatemic, hyperglobulinemic patients. Identification of 13 additional hyperglobulinemia patients revealed that hyperglobulinemia was not invariably associated with hyperphosphatemia. These data suggest that (1) with discrete automated analyzer use, hyperglobulinemia but not hyperalbuminemia may falsely elevate serum inorganic phosphate levels; (2) increased measured serum inorganic phosphate levels appear to be determined by both the concentration and the physicochemical characteristics of the globulin; (3) physicians should avoid prescribing phosphate binders to hyperglobulinemia patients with \"hyperphosphatemia\" unless they have ascertained that the serum inorganic phosphate level has been measured in a specimen that is free of protein; and (4) the occurrence of \"pseudohyperphosphatemia\" should suggest the need for an evaluation to rule out the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy.\r"

Before glucocorticoid replacement therapy, both TRH and sulpiride administration resulted in PRL hyper-responsiveness. The sulpiride-induced PRL increase was higher than that induced by TRH. L-dopa administration resulted in normal PRL suppression. Following glucocorticoid replacement therapy, the elevated basal PRL level returned to normal, and PRL hyper-responsiveness to TRH or sulpiride also returned to normal. These data suggest that the elevation of basal PRL level and PRL hyper-responsiveness observed in this patient is caused by glucocorticoid deficiency.\r"

The plasma level of cyclosporine increased promptly in both groups after dosing. Peak plasma concentrations ranged from 435 to 1,542 ng/ml and were attained at between 2 and 6 hours in the apancreatic dogs, and concentrations from 602 to 4,414 ng/ml were attained at between 1 and 6 hours in the control dogs. Even though there was substantial variation among animals, the plasma concentration curve of the apancreatic group was quite comparable with that of the control group. The Student's test for unpaired data failed to show any significant differences over the time course. Area under the concentration-time curves, maximum concentration, and times of peak concentration were calculated. These data demonstrated the capacity of apancreatic dogs with islet autografts to absorb cyclosporine when they are stable, nutritionally normal, and have full endocrine reconstitution.\r"

The level of activity in maternal blood (excluding mothers subjected to plasma exchange) at the time of delivery, was higher than that in cord blood in 61% of cases. In 23% of cases the level of activity was appreciably (0.05 units) higher in cord blood, and two-thirds of these cord samples contained the E2+ electrophoretic variant of plasma cholinesterase. The mean levels of activity in maternal and cord blood of Rhesus negative patients were significantly lower than those among Rhesus positive patients but there was no such distinction between Rhesus positive and Rhesus negative males and nonpregnant females. We encountered an incidence of 1:228 abnormal phenotypes in a series of 1593 mothers who underwent Caesarean section under a technique of general anaesthesia which included a suxamethonium infusion.

In the first group (n = 9), effects of intravenously administered protamine on systemic hemodynamics, blood/gas tensions, and arterial and mixed-venous prostanoid levels were studied. The second group (n = 7) was pretreated with indomethacin 10 mg/kg, and the same measurements were made. All pigs received heparin 150 units/kg. When protamine 1.1 +/- 0.1 mg/kg was administered over 3 minutes, marked hemodynamic alterations were observed in group 1: pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance increased, and left ventricular end-diastolic and systemic arterial pressures decreased. Arterial and mixed-venous PO2 values deteriorated in all pigs in group 1 at the end of protamine infusion. These alterations were accompanied by significantly elevated prostanoid levels in arterial and mixed-venous plasma samples: Thromboxane A2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, KH2-PGF2 alpha (a metabolite of prostaglandin F2 alpha), and prostacyclin were maximally elevated at completion of protamine and remained significantly above control values at 5 minutes but were not significantly different from control after 10 minutes. Blocking the cyclooxygenase cascade by pretreatment of the pigs with indomethacin (group 2) prevented hemodynamic and blood gas alterations. It is concluded that in pigs the detrimental side effects associated with the use of protamine to reverse heparin are mediated by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase cascade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of blood volume augmentation and mechanical ventilation (MV) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were studied in nine Beagles anesthetized with halothane before and after thrombin-induced pulmonary hypertension. The effect of therapy with dopamine, norepinephrine with and without nitroglycerin (NTG), and intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) were studied in a second series of six Beagles. Before thrombin, dextran (35 ml.kg-1) caused a significant increase in right and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RV and LVEDV, and RV and LVESV). However, RV and LV performance, as estimated by ejection fraction, was unchanged during volume loading and MV with PEEP when the pulmonary vasculature was intact. The response to volume loading and MV with PEEP was altered significantly once PVR had been increased with the administration of thrombin. Stroke volumes were decreased, and remained so, despite volume loading and MV with PEEP. LVEDV decreased without a decrease in LVEDP, indicating a decreased LV compliance. Dopamine and norepinephrine with and without NTG increased stroke volumes and RV ejection fraction in contrast to IABP. Assessment of LV performance, according to the Frank-Starling mechanism, requires a measure of end-diastolic volume when diffuse pulmonary vasoconstriction leads to RV distension and LV hypovolemia secondary to septal shift. Measurement of LV filling pressures can provide misleading values to estimate changes in LV volume in this setting. Measurement of ventricular volumes is required for optimal management of patients with severe acute respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lidocaine were studied in nine chronically prepared pregnant ewes and their fetuses at a mean ( +/- SE) gestation of 119 +/- 1.0 days, and the results were compared to the data previously published for ten animals at 138 +/- 1.2 days of gestation (term 148 days). Lidocaine was infused intravenously to the mother at a constant rate of 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 over a period of 180 min, in order to reach a steady-state maternal plasma lidocaine concentration of approximately 2 micrograms/ml. Maternal and fetal blood samples and maternal urine were collected at intervals throughout the infusion for determination of pH, blood gases, and lidocaine concentrations. Maternal and fetal heart rate, blood pressure, and intraamniotic pressure were continuously recorded. Fetal cardiac output and organ blood flow were determined before and at the end of lidocaine infusion using radionuclide-labeled microspheres. Lidocaine tissue concentrations were determined in several maternal and fetal organs excised at the end of infusion. In both groups, the steady-state plasma concentrations of lidocaine were similar; namely, 2.3 +/- 0.17 and 2.1 +/- 0.21 micrograms/ml in preterm and term ewes, respectively. There were also no significant differences in steady-state plasma drug concentrations in preterm and term fetuses (1.3 +/- 0.11 and 1.2 +/- 0.15 micrograms/ml). The mean fetal maternal concentration ratios (F/M) were the same; namely, 0.6. Maternal urinary excretion of lidocaine correlated with urine pH, being greater in the more acid urine. Tissue uptake of drug tended to be higher in the preterm than term mothers, but only significantly so in the brain and adrenals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured during alfentanil-induced rigidity in rats. Ten rats had arterial, central venous (CVP), and subdural cannulae inserted under halothane anesthesia. The animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia (PCO2 = 42 +/- 1 mmHg, mean +/- SE). Following instrumentation, halothane was discontinued and alfentanil (125 mu/kg) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesia. In the five rats that developed somatic rigidity, ICP and CVP increased significantly above baseline (delta ICP 7.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg, delta CVP 5.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg). These variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with metocurine. In five rats that did not become rigid, ICP and CVP did not change following alfentanil. These observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems.\r"

  ".W": "This study tests the hypothesis that susceptibility to the tussive effect of hypotonic aerosol is related to the ventilatory response to CO2. The threshold concentration of saline required to elicit cough and the ventilatory response to CO2 were determined in 18 normal subjects. Twelve subjects coughed with hypotonic aerosol (responders), and six did not (nonresponders). The CO2 ventilatory responses, which were normalized for vital capacity, were greater in the responders than in the nonresponders (0.64 +/- 0.16 and 0.43 +/- 0.12 L/min/mm Hg/L, respectively, p less than 0.02). The differences in the ventilatory responses to CO2 were consequent to a lesser increase in respiratory frequency in the nonresponders as compared to the responders (0.35 +/- 0.33 and 0.77 +/- 0.32 breaths/min/mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.02). There were no differences in vital capacity-normalized tidal volume responses between the 2 groups (0.02 +/- 0.01 and 0.02 +/- 0.01 L/mm Hg/L). These findings suggest that susceptibility to the tussive effect of hypotonic aerosol and CO2 ventilatory response may be determined by a common neural mechanism. Differences in the respiratory patterns assumed by the responders and nonresponders during CO2 rebreathing suggest that the blunted CO2 response in the nonresponders may be related to a decrease in gain of volume-related vagal feedback. It is suggested that hypotonic cough threshold and CO2 ventilatory responses may be mediated by similar airway receptors.\r"

Each pair represented pretherapy (susceptible) and posttherapy (resistant) specimens. In all cases, the imipenem-resistant isolates did not demonstrate changed susceptibilities to other beta-lactams. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed no change in plasmid profiles between any pair of isolates. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the Sarkosyl-insoluble membrane protein revealed the loss of an outer membrane protein of apparent molecular mass 48 to 49 kilodaltons in posttherapy strains when grown with imipenem selection (5 micrograms/ml). There was no significant difference in the binding of [14C]imipenem to the penicillin-binding proteins of the pre- and posttherapy strains. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation of membranes isolated after growth in the presence of [14C]imipenem revealed that significantly less drug was bound to Sarkosyl-soluble membrane protein in three of the four posttherapy strains than the membrane proteins of the respective pretherapy strains. beta-Lactamase activity against imipenem at 100 or 3 microM was not detected in any isolate either with or without induction. These data suggest that resistance to imipenem is associated with the loss of a 48- to 49-kilodalton outer membrane protein accompanied by, in three of four cases, decreased penetration of the antibiotic across the outer membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240; AM-833) is a new trifluorinated quinolone exhibiting high activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Healthy male volunteers received, according to a randomized scheme, oral doses of 200, 400, or 800 mg of fleroxacin in tablet form, an intravenous infusion of 100 mg, or 400 mg of fleroxacin orally together with 1,000 mg of probenecid. Fleroxacin is characterized pharmacokinetically by a long elimination half-life (9 to 10 h) and high concentrations in plasma (e.g., maximum concentration of 2.3 micrograms/ml after an oral dose of 200 mg). The volume of distribution clearly exceeds 1 liter/kg and suggests a good tissue penetration. Within 60 h, the cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug amounted to 50 to 60% of the dose. The renal clearance of unbound drug was 137 ml/min, and probenecid had no significant effect on renal elimination. A good linear correlation (r = 0.999) was found between doses from 100 to 800 mg and the resulting values of area under the concentration-time curve. The absolute bioavailability of the administered tablet was practically 100%. During oral multiple dosing of 800 or 1,200 mg of fleroxacin once a day over 10 consecutive days, the accumulation of the drug in plasma was close to the theoretically predicted value of 1.3 and reflected the persistence of linear pharmacokinetics.\r"

This compound exhibited a uniformly long elimination half-life and was distributed exceptionally well into all tissues. This extravascular penetration of azithromycin was demonstrated by tissue/plasma area-under-the-curve ratios ranging from 13.6 to 137 compared with ratios for erythromycin of 3.1 to 11.6. The significance of these pharmacokinetic advantages of azithromycin over erythromycin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models. Azithromycin was orally effective in treating middle ear infections induced in gerbils by transbulla challenges with amoxicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae or susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; erythromycin failed and cefaclor was only marginally active against the H. influenzae challenge. Azithromycin was equivalent to cefaclor and erythromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae. In mouse models, the new macrolide was 10-fold more potent than erythromycin and four other antibiotics against an anaerobic infection produced by Fusobacterium necrophorum. Similarly, azithromycin was effective against established tissue infections induced by Salmonella enteritidis (liver and spleen) and Staphylococcus aureus (thigh muscle); erythromycin failed against both infections. The oral and subcutaneous activities of azithromycin, erythromycin, and cefaclor were similar against acute systemic infections produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, or S. aureus, whereas azithromycin was more potent than erythromycin and cefaclor against the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. The pharmacokinetic advantage of azithromycin over erythromycin in half-life was clearly demonstrated in prophylactic treatment of an acute mouse model of S. aureus infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Its activity was, in most respects, similar to that of other glycopeptides, such as vancomycin and teicoplanin. However, in addition to inhibiting gram-positive bacteria, A40926 was very active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A40926 was rapidly bactericidal for N. gonorrhoeae clinical isolates at concentrations equal to or slightly higher than the MIC. In mice, levels in serum were higher and more prolonged than those of an equivalent subcutaneous dose of teicoplanin. These properties suggest that A40926 may have potential in the therapy of gonorrhea.\r"

Gurusiddaiah et al. (S. Gurusiddaiah, D. M. Weller, A. Sarkar, and R. J. Cook, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 29:488-495, 1986) attributed a dimeric phenazine structure to an antibiotic with demonstrably similar properties obtained from the same bacterial strain. Direct comparison of the physicochemical properties of the authentic antibiotic obtained from D. M. Weller with synthetic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid and with the natural product from the present study established that all three samples were indistinguishable within the experimental error of each method. No evidence to support the existence of a biologically active dimeric species was obtained. Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid has a pKa of 4.24 +/- 0.01 (25 degrees C; I = 0.09), and its carboxylate anion shows no detectable antimicrobial activity compared with the active uncharged carboxylic acid species. These data suggest that phenazine-1-carboxylic acid is probably not an effective biological control agent for phytopathogens in environments with a pH greater than 7.\r"

The melanocytes observed in piebald hypomelanotic spots seem to be classified into the following two types: (1) strongly dopa-positive and markedly hyperdendritic large cell type and (2) moderately dopa-positive and slightly hyperdendritic, oversized cell type. The former are primarily seen in hypomelanotic lesions, while the latter are seen in transitional lesions. The above difference seems to be associated with compensatory melanogenic function of melanocytes in vivo. Moreover, we have induced new hyperpigmented spots in hypomelanotic lesions, with the exception of white forelock, following therapy with oral methoxsalen plus ultraviolet A light.\r"

Due to the small number of deaths and a relatively short observation period, the study was considered inconclusive. This study has been updated by adding 7 yr of observation. The number of deaths in the study cohort has increased from 163 to 295. Mortality from all causes was found to be lower than expected (295 observed vs. 318 expected deaths) as well as mortality from all cancers (62 observed vs. 80 expected deaths). A statistically significant excess in deaths was observed in the disease category that includes cancer of the liver (primary and unspecified), gall bladder, and biliary tract (5 observed vs. 1.9 expected; p less than .05). Most of this excess was observed in women employed in one plant. Due to the small number of deaths and the variability of specific cause of death within this category, it remains difficult to interpret these findings in regard to PCB exposure.\r"

The patients were studied either in the basal state or while receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and the metabolic effects were assessed using the primed-constant infusion of a combination of stable isotopes and radioisotopes. Somatostatin infusion, either in the basal state or in the TPN, did not change glucose kinetics, but there was a significant decrease in the rate of net protein catabolism (NPC). In the basal studies the rate of NPC decreased from 3.4 +/- 0.7 g/kg/d to 2.9 +/- 0.7 g/kg/d (p less than 0.002), while in the TPN patients the corresponding values were 1.48 +/- 0.61 g/kg/d and 1.10 +/- 0.50 g/kg/d, respectively (p less than 0.005). Histamine type 2 blockade with ranitidine did not significantly alter glucose kinetics, but in both the TPN patients and in the basal state ranitidine was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of NPC. In the basal state rate of NPC was 2.44 +/- 0.53 g/kg/d and during ranitidine infusion the value was 2.08 +/- 0.42 g/kg/d (p less than 0.04). Naloxone infusion did not alter glucose kinetics, but there was a significant decrease in the rate of NPC from a basal value of 2.6 +/- 0.6 g/kg/d to 2.3 +/- 0.5 g/kg/d (p less than 0.04). The infusion of the prostaglandin antagonists diclofenac or dipyridamole resulted in increases in the plasma insulin level, and as a result glucose turnover decreased in both groups. In the diclofenac group the rate of glucose turnover decreased from 14.4 +/- 1.7 mumol/kg/min to 12.6 +/- 1.3 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.02). Neither prostaglandin antagonist resulted in any significant change in the rate of NPC. Beta-adrenergic stimulation with salbutamol resulted in a significant increase in glucose turnover from 12.1 +/- 1.1 mumol/kg/min to 13.4 +/- 0.9 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.02), and the rates of appearance (Ra) of both alanine and free fatty acids (FFAs) also increased. Alanine Ra increased from 11.7 +/- 2.5 mumol/kg/min to 12.8 +/- 3.0 mumol/kg/min, and the corresponding values for FFA turnover were 7.6 +/- 1.1 mumol/kg/min and 10.3 +/- 2.1 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.03), respectively.

In order to examine submaximal exercise as an adjunctive anabolic stimulus to intravenous refeeding (IVF) in depleted subjects, 14 volunteers were studied in the postabsorptive (PA) state, after 10 days of total starvation, and again after 10 days of nutritional repletion with I.V. feedings. The subjects were randomized to one group that received IVF alone and one group that performed 1 hour of submaximal (51% of VO2max) stationary bicycle exercise daily during IVF. The exercised group was not significantly different from the nonexercised group in urinary nitrogen balance, resting energy expenditure, extremity amino acid flux, or maximal oxygen consumption. Acute exercise did not induce significant derangements in electrolytes or counter-regulatory hormone concentrations. Ten days of submaximal exercise does not appear to be detrimental in this population recovering from moderate hospitalized malnutrition, but additional anabolic stimulae may be needed for improvements in protein accrual or functional capacity.\r"

Analysis of 2647 surgical patients in these non-CC-stratified surgical DRGs demonstrated that patients with more CCs per DRG generated higher total hospital costs, a longer hospital length of stay, a greater percentage of procedures per patient, financial risk under DRG payment, more outliers, and a higher mortality rates than patients in these same DRGs with fewer CCs. These findings suggest that the current DRG classification system may be inequitable to certain groups of patients or types of hospitals vis-a-vis the non-CC-stratified surgical DRGs. Financial disincentives to treat these patients may affect both their access and quality of care in the future.\r"

In the test chamber, immediately after topical misoprostol, there was a transient and significant increase (18%) in GMBF (55.71 +/- 7.80 to 65.84 +/- 6.12 mL/min/100 g; p less than 0.05). After 15 minutes, GMBF returned to premisoprostol levels and then showed a graded drop throughout the aspirin and postaspirin periods. No grossly visible mucosal lesions were observed. In the control chamber, mucosal lesions were observed 45 minutes after aspirin administration accompanied by a graded drop in GMBF throughout the experiments. Misoprostol neither produced a sustained increase in GMBF nor prevented the subsequent reduction in GMBF induced by aspirin. Therefore, maintenance of GMBF may not be important in cytoprotection by misoprostol. The sustained nonparietal secretion induced by this synthetic PGE1 analog may be important in gastric cytoprotection.\r"

Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1. The incidence and intensity of muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium were significantly greater in the control than in the alfentanil group. The intragastric pressure during muscle fasciculations was significantly higher in the control group (16 +/- 0.7 (SEM) cm H2O) than in the alfentanil group (7.7 +/- 1.5 (SEM) cm H2O). The increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of muscle fasciculations (regression line: y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78). It is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium in healthy children. Alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations; moreover, intragastric pressure remains at its control value.\r"

ECs are seen to release arachidonic acid (20:4) metabolites that directly increase or decrease PMN movement, with their general effect being enhanced motility. This effect can be increased or decreased by treating ECs with stimulators or inhibitors of 20:4 metabolism, respectively. The metabolites include thromboxane B2, which increases PMN random motility, chemotaxis, and diapedesis in a dose-responsive manner and which acts as a chemoattractant; 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, which increases chemotaxis and diapedesis at high doses but decreases these responses at low doses; and a lipoxygenase-derived metabolite, suggested to be 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which increases chemotaxis and diapedesis. Thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin mimetics also affect chemotaxis in qualitatively similar manners as TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, respectively, but display greater potency. EC release of these metabolites is also seen to be substratum modulated, with an increased production by cells cultured on extracellular matrices. These results suggest that ECs are capable of modulating PMN motility and suggest a role for ECs in the control of PMN diapedesis.\r"

It is unknown whether the length of chronic phase is stochastic or is predetermined for each patient. Since molecular abnormalities of bcr and c-abl occur in CML, we sought to determine whether there were differences in bcr and c-abl translocation or transcription in individuals with long v short chronic phase. These studies were performed in six patients with CML in whom chronic phase was 7+ to 26 years and 20 patients in whom chronic phase was less than 7 years. All patients had translocation of c-abl to within bcr. The distribution of breakpoints in bcr were similar in both groups. Transcription of the chimeric bcr/c-abl mRNA was comparable. These data suggest that changes in bcr or c-abl alone do not determine the duration of chronic phase in CML; other factors are likely involved.\r"

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis (PAGE) of cells to which radio-labeled rIL 2 had been chemically crosslinked revealed uniform expression of the p70/75 beta subunit of the IL 2 receptor in the absence of the alpha subunit. Stimulation of this receptor with 2 nmol/L rIL 2 for five days led to acquisition of anti-CD3 redirected cytotoxicity. This was accompanied by a fivefold to tenfold elevation in the activity of intracellular N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl esterase, an LGL granule marker enzyme. These effects of IL 2 did not require induction of the Tac peptide.\r"

Though total mortality was 10% lower in the treated than control group, this difference was not statistically significant and chiefly involved diseases other than stroke or myocardial infarction. Likewise, there was no significant difference in the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke--indeed, disabling strokes were somewhat commoner among those allocated aspirin. The lower confidence limit for the effect of aspirin on non-fatal stroke or myocardial infarction, however, was a substantial 25% reduction. Migraine and certain types of musculoskeletal pain were reported significantly less often in the treated than control group, but as the control group was not given a placebo the relevance of these findings was difficult to assess. There was no apparent reduction in the incidence of cataract in the treated group. The lack of any apparent reduction in disabling stroke or vascular death contrasts with the established value of antiplatelet treatment after occlusive vascular disease.\r"

Their mortality and incidence of cancer were compared with those in 22,326 matched controls selected from the same archives. The risk of mortality in the participants relative to that in the controls was 1.01 for all causes and 0.96 for all neoplasms. Thirty eight causes of death were examined separately. Significant differences in mortality were found for leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and other injury and poisoning, with higher rates in the participants, and for cancers of the prostate and kidney and chronic bronchitis, with higher rates in the controls. The mortality from leukaemia and multiple myeloma in the participants was slightly greater than would have been expected from national values (standardised mortality ratios of 113 and 111, respectively), but in the controls it was substantially lower (standardised mortality ratios of 32 and 0, respectively). Examination of the rates of leukaemia and multiple myeloma in groups of participants showed very little difference between groups characterised by recorded doses of external radiation or type of test participation and failed to indicate any specific hazard. Evidence obtained from participants who reported themselves voluntarily (or were reported by relatives or friends) suggested that 17% of participants may have been omitted from the main study group but that any resulting bias was small. Most of the differences observed between the participants and controls were interpreted as due to chance, but some may be due to differences in smoking habits. Participation in the test programme did not seem, in itself, to have caused any detectable effect on the participants' expectation of life, apart from possibly causing small risks of developing leukaemia and multiple myeloma.\r"

Thirty five (5%) of a total of 671 patients aged 75 and over were entered as new patients on to the age-sex register of an urban group practice during one year. Twenty nine had moved into the area and six had changed their general practitioner for personal and other reasons. An average of 141 (range 71-296) days elapsed before dispatch of their medical records to the new practice. During this period an average of 3.5 (range 0-15) consultations with a general practitioner were recorded, indicating the need of such patients for medical care. The long delays were caused by the processing of medical records at the central register and the transfer of records between family practitioner committees and general practitioners. Delays were most apparent in the time taken for general practitioners to dispatch the necessary documents to the family practitioner committees, and these should be minimised. The use of a summary card written and updated by the general practitioner and retained by the patient would facilitate continuing care should patients change to a new practice. Meanwhile, assessment of elderly patients after registration with a new practice by a member of the primary health care team may identify problems before the records have been transferred and may help the resettlement of these high risk elderly patients.\r"

  ".U": "88150435\r", 
  ".W": "Biopsy samples from 27 patients referred to a colposcopy clinic in Glasgow for cervical abnormalities were assessed for the relations among colposcopic appearances, cytological and histological diagnosis, expression of papillomavirus antigen, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences. Specimens were from colposcopically abnormal areas of the transformation zone and from colposcopically apparently normal areas of the zone in the same patients (paired matched internal control tissue). All 27 women referred for abnormal smears had colposcopic abnormalities. HPV-16 or 18 DNA sequences were detected in 20 of the 27 colposcopically abnormal biopsy samples and 13 of the 27 paired normal samples. Twelve samples of colposcopically normal tissue contained histological evidence of viral infection but only four of these contained HPV DNA sequences. The other nine samples of colposcopically normal tissue which contained HPV DNA sequences were, however, histologically apparently normal. HPV-6 and 11 were not detected. Integration of the HPV-16 genome into the host chromosome was indicated in both cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and control tissues. In two thirds of the HPV DNA positive samples the histological grade was classed as normal, viral atypia, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1. Papillomavirus antigen was detected in only six of the abnormal and three of the normal biopsy samples, and HPV DNA was detected in all of these. The detection of HPV DNA correlates well with a combination of histological and cytological evidence of viral infection (20 of 22 cases in this series). A poor correlation between the site on the cervix of histologically confirmed colposcopic abnormality and the presence of HPV DNA sequences implies that a cofactor other than HPV is required for preneoplastic disease to develop. A separate study in two further sets of biopsy samples examined the state of HPV DNA alone. The sets were (a) 43 samples from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and nine external controls and (b) 155 samples from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, vulval intraepithelial neoplasia, and vulval cancer and external controls. HPV-11 was found in only two (4.7%) of the 43 specimens from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, whereas HPV-16 was found in 90 (58%) of the other 155 specimens. These results also suggest that HPV subtype is subject to geographical location rather than being an indicator of severity of the lesion or of prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of young age on survival in cervical cancer is not fully known, although evidence has suggested that it is a poor prognostic factor and that young patients should therefore be treated differently from older patients. All 10,022 cases of invasive cervical cancer in the west Midlands during 1957-81, which comprised 10% of the cases in England and Wales, were analysed to determine the prognostic effect of age. Univariate analysis showed a median survival time of 54 months for all cases, with survival rates at five years of 69% for patients aged under 40 and 45% for those aged 40 or older (chi 1(2) (log rank) = 331.4; p less than 0.0001). This difference remained significant after stratification for stage (chi 1(2) (log rank) = 7.1; p = 0.008). Cox regression analysis with nine covariables, including age and year of registration, reaffirmed the importance of conventional prognostic factors such as stage of disease, size of tumour, state of lymph nodes, and differentiation of the tumour. After allowance was made for the effects of other prognostic factors young age was found to be a small but significant favourable factor that did not change during the period of the study. Estimated survival distributions obtained from the Cox model showed that for women presenting with the common characteristics associated with stage Ib disease who were treated with radical radiotherapy the survival rate at five years fell non-linearly from 71% in the group aged 25-29 to 65% in the group aged 65-69. Young age alone is not a reason to alter existing policies for treatment for patients with invasive cervical cancer.\r"

In such a plot if the relative risks from various studies are plotted according to sample size they should scatter round some underlying true value, the scatter being greatest where the studies have the lowest statistical power--thus showing a \"funnel\" pattern. If there is publication bias and studies with non-significant results are not being published there should be a \"gap\" in the plot. The logarithm of the relative risks was plotted against the standard error of the logarithm of the relative risk (which was used instead of sample size as a measure of statistical uncertainty). The resulting plot was compatible with a publication bias but only in studies on men. Further studies of passive smoking and lung cancer in men seem to be warranted.\r"

This consisted of high-dose doxorubicin (70 mg/m2) and cisplatin (100 mg/m2) alternated with CHF (cyclophosphamide, hexamethylmelamine, and 5-fluorouracil). Toxicity (myelosuppression, nephropathy, and neuropathy) was infrequent and mild. Clinical response rates were high (94% response, 62% complete clinical response), but the majority of patients had residual intraabdominal disease at second-look surgery (75%). Thirteen patients (26%) are alive after 4 years of observation (minimum follow-up). Survival was adversely influenced in patients who were older than 70, had Stage IV disease, residual tumor bulk greater than 2 cm, and who failed to achieve complete clinical remission. The median duration of survival (28 months) and percentage of long-term survivors appear similar to that in other platinum-based chemotherapy studies. Although the role of alternating combination chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian cancer remains undefined, it is likely that an alternate approach will be necessary to markedly improve survival rates for patients with this disease.\r"

The remaining 10 patients were anesthetized with a totally intravenous anesthetic technique with midazolam and alfentanil. The effect was assessed by means of a rating scale divided into degree of sedation and amnesia. A good correlation was found between plasma level of midazolam and pharmacodynamic response. The relation between the quantal response data and the plasma concentration was represented by an s-shaped concentration-effect curve. Despite similar kinetics of midazolam in the two groups, the postoperative drowsiness was more pronounced in the group receiving total intravenous anesthesia. The concomitant administration of alfentanil shifted the concentration-effect curve regarding sedation to the left.\r"

After induced bronchoconstriction, single slow and rapid inspirations to total lung capacity transiently abolished or attenuated the bronchoconstriction in normal controls.

  ".W": "1. We have previously shown that the hypertrophy of the kidney induced by a high protein diet consists of a preferential hypertrophy of the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle's loop. This might be related to an increase in the active salt transport by this segment. Sodium, potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+-ATPase) activity was measured in TAL from kidneys of rats fed either a low (LP) or a high (HP) protein diet for several weeks. 2. Enzymatic activity was measured by microdensitometry, after appropriate cytochemical reaction, for an adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) concentration of 0-66 mmol/l. Both activity per unit tubular length and mean activity per unit tissue volume were recorded. A calibration was designed to convert usual microdensitometry units (extinction) into conventional biochemical units (mol of product formed). 3. For non-limiting substrate concentrations, the Na+,K+-ATPase activity, expressed per unit length of tubule on the sections, was 50% higher in HP than in LP rats, an increase proportional to that of the simultaneously measured tubule diameter. When expressed per unit tubular volume, Na+,K+-ATPase activity was similar in both groups of rats. The dissociation constant for ATP was also similar in both groups. 4. Results show that a high protein diet induces an increase in Na+,K+-ATPase activity in TAL, thus enabling an enhanced NaCl transport in this segment. This increase in transport capacity is not due to an increase in the density of enzymatic units but to an increase in their number, in relation to the hypertrophy of the TAL.\r"

Its most dramatic biological property is its ability to induce arachidonate metabolites in a variety of cells including PGE in the brain, fibroblasts, synovial cells, and chondrocytes; in addition, IL-1 induces lipoxygenase products in lymphocytes and other cells. IL-1 has been cloned. There are two forms. The predominant form of IL-1 from human monocytes has a pI of 7 (also called beta) and is initially synthesized as a precursor molecule (31 kD). A minor form (less than 100-fold) also exists (pI 5, also called alpha). IL-1 seems unique among the lymphokines and monokines in that there is no signal peptide sequence for cleavage. Depending on the stimulus, intracellular levels of precursor IL-1 can be high, whereas some cell activators result in large amounts of processed IL-1. Precursor IL-1 is cleaved into a 17.5-kD peptide, which is the predominant extracellular form. IL-1 induces prostaglandins and lymphocyte activation as well as many different biological activities. These include fever, PGE production, protease release from synovial cells and chondrocytes, bone resorption, acute-phase protein synthesis, and other effects. Although there are few studies showing an IL-1 effect on the gastrointestinal tract, the multiple biological properties of IL-1 suggest that IL-1 plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease as well as in mediating some of the gastrointestinal changes observed in systemic acute-phase responses.\r"

Inhibition of eicosanoid production is the basic mechanism of action of corticosteroids and of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Eicosanoid synthesis is also increased in human and experimental inflammatory bowel disease. Leukotriene B4 is the most potent proinflammatory eicosanoid, and in vivo production of this compound is the predominant eicosanoid in colitis. Recent experimental data demonstrate that selective inhibition of leukotrienes may be a therapeutic strategy to reduce inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Clinical findings include abdominal distention and diarrhea, and systemic symptoms such as apnea, acidosis, and lethargy. Pneumatosis intestinalis can be demonstrated radiographically. Mucosal ulcerations, hemorrhage, and thrombosis occur early, followed by inflammatory changes. Later still necrosis develops. Ischemia, infection, and enteral feedings are suspected to be involved in the pathophysiology.

The normal dogs did not have a diurnal plasma POMC peptide rhythm; the dog with Cushing's disease appeared to have a similar number of secretory episodes of increased amplitude. Plasma POMC peptides and cortisol in animals with Cushing's disease did not suppress normally with low dose dexamethasone. Five animals with Cushing's disease did suppress with high dose dexamethasone, the dog with dual adenomas suppressed only partially, and 1 dog with a pars intermedia adenoma did not suppress at all. The response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was similar in normal dogs and 4 dogs with Cushing's disease, but 3 animals with adrenal tumors did not respond. The response to metyrapone was normal in 6 dogs with Cushing's disease and, surprisingly, in 1 with adrenal tumor. Arginine vasopressin stimulated POMC peptide secretion in normal and 6 Cushing's dogs, as well as alpha MSH, a pars intermedia-type POMC peptide, in a dog presumed to have a pars intermedia tumor. Ovine CRF stimulated pars distalis-type POMC peptide secretion in normal dogs and 17 dogs with Cushing's disease, but not in 15 dogs with adrenal tumor; IR-alpha MSH was unaffected. TRH appeared to stimulate IR-ACTH in normal animals, but not in those with Cushing's disease. Dopamine had no apparent effect in 2 normal and 1 Cushing's dogs. Initial plasma disappearance t1/2 values of IR-ACTH and lipotropin were 22-27 min. In summary, responses in normal and Cushing's dogs were generally what would be predicted from previous human and animal studies, but some of those in animals with pars intermedia tumors and even in normal dogs were different from what had been anticipated. Canine Cushing's syndrome provides an interesting model for an uncommon human disorder.\r"

GRF-44 (1 microgram, icv) elicited significant (P less than 0.005) increases in the concentration of HA in the anterior hypothalamus, posterior hypothalamus, median eminence, adenohypophysis, neurohypophysis, frontal cortex, and, to a lesser extent, in the hippocampus, after a clear time-dependent pattern with maxima 15 min after injection. In contrast, SS-14 (1 microgram, icv) significantly (P less than 0.005) decreased the levels of HA in all areas studied, except in the neurohypophysis. The SS-induced HA levels reached minima 30 min after injection. The antagonistic effects of GRF-44 and SS-14 on the release of brain HA were dose dependent, showing an inverse linear correlation within the range 0.1-10 micrograms in the anterior hypothalamus (r = -0.59) and posterior hypothalamus (r = -0.75). Responses of HA to GRF-44 and SS-14 (range: 0.1-10 micrograms) also exhibited an inverse linear correlation in the median eminence (r = -0.90) and adenohypophysis (r = -0.58), while in the hippocampus and frontal cortex the antagonistic effects of GRF and SS displayed an inverse curvilinear correlation. SS-14 ED50 values ranged from 0.6 to 1.75 nmol with Emax of 0.65-6.10 nmol. GRF-44 ED50 values ranged from 0.02-0.3 nmol and the Emax values oscillated between 0.2 and 1.90 nmol in the regions studied. The greatest responses of HA to GRF-44 and SS-14 were obtained in the hypothalamo-hypophyseal system. Although brain HA is present in both the neuronal and the mast cell compartments, changes induced in the concentration of HA by centrally administered GRF-44 and SS-14 appear to occur mostly in the neuronal compartment. Therefore, it is likely that the somatotropinergic and histaminergic systems reciprocally interact at the central level to regulate still unknown neuroendocrine functions.\r"

Phosphoinositide metabolism results in the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor of both the cyclooxygenase (CO) and lipoxygenase (LO) pathway. The effects of both LO and CO inhibitors on AII action were studied using both static incubations and perifusions of rat renal cortical slices. 12-Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and its stable metabolite 12-hydroxyacid mimicked the inhibitory actions of AII on renin. A specific CO blocker did not alter AII inhibition of renin and a 5-LO blocker U60,257 was also ineffective, whereas the LO blockers BW755c, phenidone, and baicalein all eliminated or interfered with the action of AII on renin. All inhibition in the presence of a LO blocker was restored by adding nanomolar concentrations of 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. LO inhibitors were specific for blocking AII, as they did not interfere with potassium (K+)-induced renin inhibition. These results imply that 12 and/or 15 products of the LO pathway are involved in AII action.\r"

  ".W": "Two subtypes of pituitary gonadotropes are known to exist: monohormonal and multihormonal. When separated by centrifugal elutriation monohormonal cells are found in the small fractions whereas multihormonal cells predominate in the large gonadotrope-enriched fractions. Since GnRH is known to shift the proportion of subtypes to cells that are mainly multihormonal, we tested its effect on the small monohormonal gonadotropes. Dispersed cells from cycling female rats were plated on glass coverslips overnight. Storage was evaluated by application of dual immunocytochemical stains with anti-LH beta and anti-FSH beta to cells stimulated with 0.5 nM [D-Lys6]GnRH. Secretion was detected by the reverse hemolytic plaque assay for LH and a newly developed RHPA for FSH. After 4 h of GnRH stimulation, the percentage of total gonadotropes was increased only in fraction (Fr.) 3 [13.9 +/- 0.4% (+/- SE) to 25.2 +/- 2%]. However, cells in Fr. 2 responded with an increase in multihormonal cells from 18.2 +/- 7% to 46.2 +/- 5%, a proportion not different from that in gonadotrope-enriched fractions. GnRH had less striking effects on changing the size or number of LH and FSH plaques. It seems, therefore, that these small gonadotropes are multipotential and respond initially to stimulation by synthesizing and storing the other gonadotropin. In contrast, the large gonadotropes (Frs. 6 and 7) showed no significant changes in storage patterns. Gonadotropes in both fractions were predominantly multihormonal. The LH and FSH reverse hemolytic plaque assays run with cells from Fr. 7 showed striking increases in both the number of plaque-forming cells and the area of the plaques in response to GnRH. However, in the multihormonal cells in Fr. 6, which were 53.5 +/- 9% of the total cell population, a heterogeneous secretory pattern was observed. In the basal state, there were 36.6 +/- 9% LH and only 2.7 +/- 2% FSH plaques, whereas after GnRH stimulation there were 43.1 +/- 10% LH and 10.5 +/- 4% FSH plaques. This finding is the first direct evidence for nonparallel release of gonadotropins from cells known to store both hormones. These studies show that gonadotrope subpopulations exhibit differences in their storage and secretory responses to GnRH. It is suggested that other factors may be required for the release of FSH from unresponsive gonadotropes in Fr. 6.\r"

  ".W": "An antibody (IgG-RB) against the chick oviduct progesterone receptor (PR) was used to study the regulation of PR by estrogen in chicken pituitary and hypothalamus. PR was revealed exclusively in cell nuclei, whatever the hormonal state, including the absence of progesterone. In immature untreated chickens, PR was not detected in the pars distalis, while the pars tuberalis, preoptic area, and infundibular region of hypothalamus showed IgG-RB-immunoreactive cells or neurons. Estrogenic stimulation induced the appearance of PR in cells of the pars distalis and increased the immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus of young chickens of both sexes. After hormonal withdrawal, PR immunostaining returned to the level in untreated immature animals. In young hens, before they laid the first egg, PR appears progressively in pars distalis cells during the pubertal period. Antibodies to pituitary hormones (LH, FSH, GH, PRL, and ACTH) were used to characterize the secretory properties of PR-containing cells. LH- and FSH-immunoreactive cells were localized throughout the pars distalis in untreated animals. After estradiol treatment of young sexually immature chickens, immunostaining of LH and FSH was strongly reduced, up to extinction, in many gonadotropic cells, and only few PR-containing cells demonstrated some immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm. In contrast, in juvenile hens, a majority of PR-containing cells were identified as LH immunoreactive, that is gonadotrophs. There are probably two reasons for the paucity of doubly reactive cells in estradiol-treated chickens. One is technical, the optimal fixation time for both LH (greater than 20 h) and PR (less than 7 h) makes it practically impossible to reveal the hormone and the receptor at the same time. The other is related to the physiology of the system, which involves the simultaneous decrease in LH immunoreactivity and the PR induction in gonadotrophs by estradiol. The presence of PR in gonadotrophs suggests a direct feedback mechanism of sex steroids on pituitary cells in addition to the indirect effect through GnRH modulation. The hormonal content of PRL-, GH-, and ACTH-producing cells was not modified by estradiol treatment, as judged by the appropriate immunoreactivity, and their nuclei did not display PR. However, PRL cells and PR-containing cells were frequently present near each other within the same cell cords.\r"

In vivo treatment of immature hypophysectomized diethylstilbestrol-treated rats with increasing doses (0.3-30 microgram/rat, twice daily) of FSH for 72 h resulted in dose-dependent increments in specific granulosa cell somatomedin-C (Sm-C)/IGF-I binding, peaking (5150 +/- 350 cpm/3 x 10(5) cells) at the 10 micrograms/rat (twice daily) dose level to yield a 2.6-fold increase relative to that in untreated controls. This FSH (10 micrograms/rat, twice daily) effect proved time dependent; the first significant (P less than 0.05) increase in binding (3670 +/- 150 cpm/3 x 10(5) cells) was noted after 48 h of treatment (1.6-fold increase). Significantly, little or no variation was observed for basal Sm-C/IGF-I binding over the course of the experiment, suggesting that this component of Sm-C/IGF-I receptor complement may be independent of the trophic influence(s) of the pituitary gland. Equilibrium competition studies carried out with granulosa cells derived from both control and FSH-treated rats revealed linear Scatchard plots consistent with a single class of noninteracting binding sites, a 2.8-fold increase in FSH-associated Sm-C/IGF-I-binding capacity, but not affinity (Kd control, 1.9 +/- 0.3 nM; kd FSH, 2.6 +/- 0.9 nM). Limited specificity studies of the FSH-induced receptor revealed related peptides to compete for Sm-C/IGF-I binding with a relative rank order of potency of Sm-C/IGF-I much greater than multiplication-stimulating activity greater than insulin, a pattern compatible with a type I IGF receptor. A series of other polypeptides, including porcine relaxin, porcine proinsulin, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor as well as transforming growth factor-alpha and -beta (TGF beta) were nonreactive. Significantly, the induced type I IGF receptor proved functionally coupled to granulosa cell proteoglycan biosynthesis. The ability of FSH (10 micrograms/rat, twice daily) to enhance granulosa cell Sm-C/IGF-I binding was significantly (P less than 0.05) up-regulated (1.53-fold amplification) by ovine GH (100 micrograms/rat, twice daily); a down-regulatory effect (64% inhibition) was observed for a potent GnRH agonist [( D-Ala6,Des-Gly10]GnRH ethyl amide; 25 micrograms/rat, twice daily). Once induced, the Sm-C/IGF-I receptor of the granulosa cell required the continued presence of either FSH or LH for its maintenance; the lactogenic receptor agonist PRL had no effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

It is possible that the action of these hormones on Sertoli cells results in an increased capacity for the cells to carry out their prescribed functions, among which are the synthesis and secretion of specific glycoproteins. Changes in the testicular levels of two specific mRNAs in hypophysectomized hormone-treated rats were determined by solution hybridization to cRNA probes. The mRNAs coding for transferrin and sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2), both of which are secretion products of Sertoli cells, decreased dramatically in the testis of hypophysectomized rats that were maintained for 20 days untreated with hormones. If hypophysectomy was done to rats at 20 days of age, daily injections for a subsequent 20 days with FSH or FSH in combination with testosterone partially maintained both transferrin and SGP-2 mRNA levels. Testosterone alone was ineffective in 20-day-old rats. In contrast, if hypophysectomy was performed on 40-day-old rats, daily injections of testosterone alone or in combination with FSH were most effective in maintaining higher levels of the specific mRNAs. When the Sertoli cells from rats hypophysectomized at 20 days of age were placed in cell culture, FSH again was most effective in the stimulation of transferrin mRNA above control levels. However, when the Sertoli cells from the rats hypophysectomized at 40 days of age were placed in culture, FSH was slightly stimulatory, but testosterone had no effect on the transferrin mRNA levels. Neither FSH nor testosterone affected the levels of SGP-2 mRNA in the cultured cells regardless of the age of the animal at the time of hypophysectomy. Additional in vivo studies were done in which the rats were hypophysectomized at 20 days of age, allowed to regress for 17 days, and then injected daily with hormones for 3 days. The levels of transferrin and SGP-2 mRNA in this experiment were stimulated by FSH alone or by a combination of FSH and testosterone to an extent similar to that in the cultured cells. These studies showed that FSH is most important in the younger rats and testosterone is most important in the older rats in the maintenance of specific mRNA levels. In addition, the level of stimulation observed with either hormone is different depending on whether the hormone is given in culture or in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Estradiol (E2) exerts both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on DNA synthesis in the rat uterine luminal epithelium (LE). This inhibitory effect is due to a shift in the time course of DNA synthesis, i.e. in animals receiving a single injection of E2, a peak of DNA synthesis occurs 24 h after treatment, but in animals receiving multiple injections of E2, DNA synthesis is suppressed until 10-12 h after hormone treatment ceases. In these previous studies LE DNA synthesis was assessed by measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation. In the present study, we sought to determine if the molecular basis for this decrease in DNA synthesis was due to a suppression of DNA polymerase activity in LE nuclei. Animals receiving a single injection of E2 exhibit a peak of nuclear DNA polymerase activity 20-24 h later. Animals receiving multiple injections of E2 (0, 12, 15, and 18 h) show more than a 50% decrease in DNA polymerase activity at 20-24 h, due to a shift in the maximum increase in enzyme activity to 32-36 h after the initial treatment. The observed differences between these groups are not due to different levels of DNase activity or different degrees of leakage of the nuclear enzyme. The observed enzyme activity is due to DNA polymerase-alpha, since it requires ATP as well as deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and is aphidicolin sensitive. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of E2 on LE DNA synthesis is due at least in part to a suppression of nuclear DNA polymerase-alpha activity.\r"

Phenylephrine (PHE) stimulated in vitro GH release; the maximal effect (2.5-fold stimulation) occurred at 1 microM PHE. The effect was completely blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine and partially counteracted by the beta-antagonist propranolol. Experiments with the fluorescent Ca2+ probe fura 2 show that PHE causes [Ca2+]i to rise from 178 +/- 31 nM (mean +/- SE; n = 25) to 370 +/- 55 nM (n = 9). This effect was complete within 20 sec and was maintained for at least 5-10 min. The rise was rapidly interrupted by administration of 1 microM phentolamine. The beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol caused a small [Ca2+]i rise due to action on alpha 1-adrenoreceptors. The PHE-induced [Ca2+]i rise showed two components: an initial peak due to Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and a subsequent rise due to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. Somatostatin (SRIF) lowered both resting [Ca2+]i and Ca2+ influx stimulated by PHE. Pertussis toxin pretreatment did not modify PHE-induced [Ca2+]i changes, while it completely prevented the effect of SRIF on both resting and triggered [Ca2+]i, thus suggesting that a GTP-binding protein sensitive to the toxin is involved in the transduction of SRIF action. The increase in cAMP induced by cholera toxin pretreatment modified neither PHE nor SRIF action on [Ca2+]i. In conclusion, in rat somatotrophs Ca2+ mobilization and influx are stimulated by alpha 1-adrenergic agents, and this triggered [Ca2+]i rise results in a stimulation of GH release. In these cells SRIF is able to reduce both resting [Ca2+]i levels and [Ca2+]i increases induced by alpha 1-adrenergic activation.\r"

  ".W": "The following study was undertaken to compare the content of aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom) mRNA with the content of the enzyme in rat ovarian tissues and to relate these changes with estradiol biosynthesis by follicles and corpora lutea isolated throughout pregnancy. A deoxyoligonucleotide (62 mer) probe derived from an amino acid sequence of purified human placental P450arom was used to screen a rat granulosa cell lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. Seven cDNA clones, ranging in size from 0.6-2.0 kilobases (kb), were identified and plaque purified. In vitro translation using mRNA that had been selected by hybridization to a 1.2-kb rat P450arom cDNA insert yielded an 35S-labeled translation product that bound antihuman aromatase immunoglobulin and comigrated with purified human placental aromatase on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thus verifying that the clones do encode for P450arom. Using the 1.2-kb cDNA insert as a radiolabeled probe, the hormonal regulation, tissue distribution, content, and size of mRNA for P450arom were analyzed. Filter hybridization assays demonstrated that P450arom mRNA was low in small antral (SA) follicles, increased 16-fold in preovulatory (PO) follicles, and reached a peak in granulosa cells within 1 h after an ovulatory dose of hCG. In the corpus luteum of pregnancy, P450arom mRNA content was low on day 4, and increased 3-fold on days 7-11 and 10-fold on days 15-19 of gestation. P450arom mRNA then decreased on days 21 and 23, the day of parturition. Northern analyses of RNA from PO follicles and corpora lutea revealed three bands of P450arom mRNA that were 3.3, 2.6, and 1.9 kb in size. Immunoblots of soluble cell extracts of SA, PO, and luteinizing (PO plus hCG) follicles and corpora lutea of pregnancy demonstrated that aromatase enzyme was low in SA follicles, increased 1.5- to 3-fold in PO follicles, and decreased within 3-5 h after an ovulatory dose of hCG. Changes in the content of P450arom enzyme in luteal cells during pregnancy exhibited a pattern similar to that observed for P450arom mRNA. In contrast, changes in estradiol biosynthesis by follicles and corpora lutea were not directly related to the contents of P450arom mRNA and enzyme. For example, although corpora lutea isolated on days 15-21 of gestation contain the highest amount of P450arom mRNA and enzyme, these tissues did not produce the most estradiol when incubated for 5 h at 37 C in the presence of aromatizable androgen substrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We investigated the effect of synthetic rat ANP with 24 amino acids (atriopeptin III) on renin release in vitro in a dynamic superfusion system of renal cortical slices as well as collagenase-dispersed juxtaglomerular cells. In the superfusion system of kidney slices, isoproterenol (5 x 10(-8) M) clearly stimulated renin release from kidney slices, while angiotensin II (AII; 10(-5) M) suppressed renin release. ANP (10(-10)-10(-6) M) did not inhibit basal renin release or blunt the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol. The suppression of renin secretion by AII was never modified in the presence of ANP. The superfusion system of juxtaglomerular cells demonstrated greater sensitivity of renin release in responses to isoproterenol and AII. In this system, ANP (10(-6) M) did not alter renin release from the cells stimulated by isoproterenol (5 x 10(-8) M) or inhibited by AII (10(-8) M). However, basal renin release was slightly stimulated in the late phase of ANP superfusion and for 20 min after the ANP perfusion was stopped. Similarly, 8 bromo-cGMP (10(-6) M) did not inhibit, but, rather, stimulated basal renin release slightly. These results suggest that ANP does not inhibit renin release by a direct effect on the juxtaglomerular cell in the rat.\r"

ANP did not block the calcium transient induced by beta-[Asp1]angiotensin II (beta-[Asp1]AII), an AII analog, but markedly reduced the stimulated rate of aldosterone secretion. Consistent with these findings, radiolabeled 45Ca efflux stimulated by AII and carbachol was not altered by the concurrent addition of ANP.

  ".W": "The effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and oxytocin (OT) on cAMP and cGMP accumulation was investigated in LLC-PK1 kidney epithelial cells. The addition of ANP, AVP, and OT to intact cells produced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in cGMP accumulation. ANP produced a 1.7-fold increase in cGMP at 10 pM and a maximal 28-fold increase in cGMP at 1 microM. ANP had no effect on basal or AVP-induced stimulation of cAMP accumulation. OT was 10-fold more potent than AVP at increasing cGMP levels, producing a 2.1-fold increase in cGMP at 0.1 nM, whereas AVP was 100-fold more potent at increasing cAMP levels. At a concentration of 1 microM, AVP and OT produced a maximal 12 to 14-fold increase in cGMP, while OT and AVP produced 50- and 90-fold increase in cAMP, respectively. The selective OT agonist [Thr4, Gly7]oxytocin was very effective at increasing cGMP, but not at increasing cAMP levels. The V2-vasopressin agonist [deamino-Pen1,Val4, D-Arg8]vasopressin did not increase cGMP levels, but produced a 20-fold increase in cAMP levels. The addition of ANP together with either AVP or OT produced an additive increase in cGMP content. Simultaneous addition of AVP and OT did not lead to a greater increase in cAMP or cGMP levels. These results suggest that the AVP- and OT-induced increase in cGMP is mediated by OT receptors, whereas the increase in cAMP is probably mediated by vasopressin receptors. ANP increased the activity of particulate guanylate cyclase by 6-fold, while AVP and OT has no effect on particulate guanylate cyclase activity. The relatively selective inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, methylene blue, had no effect on the ANP-induced increase in cGMP content in intact cells, but produced a 50% inhibition of the increase in cGMP by AVP and OT. Methylene blue did not alter the stimulation of cAMP by AVP or OT. These results demonstrate that ANP, AVP, and OT increase cGMP in LLC-PK1 kidney epithelial cells. The increase in cGMP by ANP is mediated by particulate guanylate cyclase, whereas AVP and OT probably increase cGMP by interacting with OT receptors coupled to soluble guanylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "GnRH and its agonists are known to induce ovulation in hypophysectomized rats by acting directly at the ovary. Because tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) has been implicated in the gonadotropin induction of ovulation, we examined the effect of an ovulatory dose of GnRH on ovarian tPA activity, mRNA content, and cellular localization. Hypophysectomized immature rats were injected sc with 20 IU PMSG and a single dose of a GnRH agonist (GnRHa; des-Gly10,DLeu6(N alpha Me)Leu7,Pro9NHEt-GnRH) 58 h later. At different times after treatment, ovaries were prepared for morphological analysis. Using a fibrin overlay method, tPA activities were measured in ovarian homogenates and cumulus-oocyte complexes, whereas granulosa cells were cultured for 24 h to estimate tPA secretion. Total ovarian RNA was prepared for hybridization analysis of tPA message levels, and tPA localization was studied by immunohistochemistry of ovarian sections. GnRHa induced ovulation in PMSG-primed hypophysectomized rats 14-16 h after injection in a dose-dependent manner, and the GnRHa action was blocked by concomitant treatment with a GnRH antagonist. GnRHa stimulated the induction of tPA, but not urokinase-type PA, activity in ovarian homogenates and granulosa cell-conditioned medium in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum before ovulation. tPA activity in cumulus-oocyte complexes was also increased before ovulation, but this increase was sustained. Hybridization analysis of steady state tPA mRNA levels was performed using a rat cRNA probe. Northern blot analysis of total ovarian RNA demonstrated that GnRHa stimulated tPA mRNA levels 12 h after treatment, with a subsequent decrease 24 h after treatment. Immunohistochemistry indicated substantial increases in tPA staining in granulosa cells and oocytes of preovulatory follicles before ovulation. Thus, GnRHa acts through specific receptors to increase ovarian tPA enzyme activity, mRNA content, as well as immunostaining in granulosa cells and oocytes. Like gonadotropins, GnRH may induce ovulation by directly stimulating tPA levels in the ovary.\r"

Using a perifusion system and dispersed pituitary cells, we found that the GH response to a pulse of GRF is unaltered over a wide range of GH concentrations.

Preincubation of Sertoli cells for 4 days with FSH, testosterone, or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone results into a 2- to 3-fold increase in mibolerone binding, as measured 18 h after removal of the agonists. The combination of androgens and FSH has additive effects. The action of FSH can be mimicked by (Bu)2cAMP, and the activity of the androgens can be blocked by the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate. The mibolerone-binding protein has the ligand specificity, affinity, and sedimentation behavior characteristic for an androgen receptor. Using a DEAE-cellulose filter disc assay and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone as a ligand, androgen-binding protein (ABP) was measured in the media of the studied Sertoli cell cultures. Despite some similarity in the hormonal control of ABP and the androgen receptor, there are distinct differences in the ligand specificity of the two androgen binding proteins, which exclude that ABP might interfere with the receptor measurements. The effects of androgens and FSH on the androgen receptor are evident at concentrations equal to or lower than those required to provoke a measurable increase in ABP secretion. It is concluded that FSH and androgens control androgen receptor levels in Sertoli cells.\r"

  ".W": "In ruminants, parturition is stimulated by increased cortisol secretion by the fetal adrenal in the last few days of fetal life. Before this preparturient surge in fetal plasma cortisol, fetal ACTH and renin secretion are suppressed by small physiological increases in the fetal plasma cortisol concentration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility that the sensitivity of ACTH and renin to cortisol inhibition is reduced at term. Fetal sheep, chronically catheterized at least 4 days before the first experiment, were subjected to iv infusion of cortisol at rates of 0 (n = 5), 1 (n = 4), 2 (n = 4), 5 (n = 5), and 10 (n = 5) micrograms/min for 5 h. One hour after the end of the cortisol infusion, fetal ACTH secretion was stimulated by fetal iv infusion of sodium nitroprusside (50 micrograms/min). In all groups, fetal plasma ACTH increased during the cortisol infusions, perhaps reflecting a circadian variation in fetal ACTH secretion which was not suppressed by cortisol. The endogenous increase in fetal ACTH during cortisol infusions produced apparently nonsteady state changes in fetal plasma cortisol concentrations. Cortisol infusion produced dose-related increases in the fetal plasma cortisol concentration. The highest rate of cortisol infusion increased fetal plasma cortisol to between 50 and 60 ng/ml. However, none of the cortisol infusions significantly suppressed fetal PRA or reduced the magnitude of the ACTH response to nitroprusside. The results demonstrate that acutely stimulated fetal ACTH secretion is not regulated by cortisol negative feedback in the last few days of fetal life. Reduction in negative feedback efficacy may allow the preparturient rise in cortisol secretion that is responsible for stimulating parturition in this species.\r"

  ".U": "88151800\r", 
  ".W": "The presence of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) immunoreactivity and receptors for ANF in the median eminence, hypothalamus, and anterior pituitary gland suggests a role for the peptide in the hypothalamic control of anterior pituitary function. In conscious ovariectomized female rats, transient elevation of plasma levels of ANF by volume loading, a stimulus known to release endogenous ANF from the heart, or by bolus iv injection of 0.1, 1.0, or 10 micrograms synthetic ANF failed to result in altered circulating levels of LH or GH. Constant iv infusion of ANF for 30 min, such that 2- to 3-fold elevations in plasma ANF were detected by RIA resulted, however, in significant inhibition of LH release in ovariectomized female rats (0.05 and 0.1 micrograms ANF/kg.min) and orchidectomized male rats (0.1 microgram ANF/kg.min). It was unlikely that this effect was exerted at the level of the anterior pituitary, since ANF failed to alter basal or LHRH-stimulated LH release from cultured anterior pituitary cells in vitro and since iv infusion of 0.1 microgram ANF/kg.min failed to alter pituitary responsiveness in vivo to a 10-ng bolus injection of LHRH. Significant inhibition of LH secretion was also observed after third cerebroventricular injection of 1.0 or 2.0 nmol ANF. As with iv infusion, central administration of ANF failed to significantly alter GH secretion. LHRH release from median eminence explants incubated in vitro in the presence of dopamine (60 or 120 microM) was inhibited by 10(-7) M ANF, suggesting a median eminence site of action of the peptide. Finally, an opiate involvement in the mechanism of ANF's action was suggested, since naloxone (0.5 mg, iv, followed by a 60-min infusion of an additional 1 mg) completely blocked the ability of ANF (0.1 or 0.5 microgram/kg.min, infused over the last 30 min of naloxone administration) to inhibit LH release. These data suggest that ANF can act centrally to alter the hypothalamic control of gonadotropin secretion, possibly by interacting with central dopaminergic and peptidergic systems. They further suggest actions of ANF within the brain unrelated to its previously described effects on fluid and electrolyte homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "The ovarian granulosa cell has recently been shown to be a site of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) production, reception, and action. In large measure, IGF-I action (in the rat) appears contingent upon its ability to synergize with FSH, a major promoter of granulosa cell differentiation. It is the objective of the in vitro studies reported herein to elucidate the cellular mechanism(s) whereby IGF-I amplifies FSH hormonal action, placing special emphasis on the potential role of the putative intracellular second messenger cAMP in this regard. Basal FSH binding (115.7 +/- 2.1 fmol/mg cell protein) to rat granulosa cells cultured under serum-free conditions remained unchanged after 72 h of treatment with IGF-I (50 ng/ml) by itself (107.1 +/- 1.0 fmol/mg cell protein). In contrast, treatment with FSH (20 ng/ml) resulted in a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in FSH binding capacity (but not affinity) relative to controls in either the absence or presence of IGF-I. Whereas treatment with FSH resulted in a substantial increase in forskolin-stimulatable adenylate cyclase activity (10 +/- 1.7% conversion of [3H] ATP to [3H]cAMP), concurrent treatment with IGF-I resulted in 2.2-fold enhancement of FSH action. This IGF-I effect proved dose dependent with an apparent median effective dose of 3.6 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, a concentration in keeping with its granulosa cell receptor binding affinity. Significantly, however, IGF-I proved capable of enhancing Bt2cAMP-stimulated progesterone accumulation suggesting that IGF-I may be also acting at site(s) distal to cAMP generation. Taken together, these and previous studies indicate that nanomolar concentrations of exogenously added IGF-I may be interacting with the FSH transduction signal at multiple cellular site(s) to effect amplification of FSH action.\r"

  ".W": "Utilizing a specific RIA for rat (r) GRF, hypothalamus and cerebral cortex from adult rat and long term dissociated fetal rat hypothalamic and cerebral cortical cell cultures were investigated for the presence of rGRF immunoreactivity (IR-GRF). After homogenization in an acidic medium, tissues and cultures were extracted on octadecylsilyl-silica columns, and IR-GRF and somatostatin (IR-SS) were measured by RIA. In extracts from the hypothalamus from the adult rat the content of IR-GRF was 3.02 +/- 0.16 ng ( +/- SE) per hypothalamus. IR-GRF was identical with synthetic rGRF on gel filtration chromatography and by parallel displacement of dilutions of extract in RIA. In extracts from cerebral cortex isolated from the adult rat, no IR-GRF was detected. In extracts from long term dissociated cell cultures from fetal hypothalami, 7.3 +/- 7 pg/10(6) cells of IR-GRF were present and were identical with synthetic rGRF by chromatographic and immunological criteria. In the extracts from cerebral cortical cell cultures cross-reacting material was present which on gel filtration chromatography revealed two peaks of immunoreactivity of higher mol wt than synthetic rGRF. There was nonparallelism on dilution of the extract. The ratio of IR-SS to IR-GRF by weight (IR-SS/IR-GRF) was calculated to compare the relative abundance of IR-GRF in cultured hypothalamic cells. In the hypothalamus isolated from the adult rat the ratio of IR-SS/IR-GRF by weight was 15.8 +/- 1.4 as compared to 48.9 +/- 10.3 in hypothalamic cultures. We conclude that IR-GRF indistinguishable from synthetic rGRF is present in long term dissociated hypothalamic cell cultures, but is relatively less abundant than in the hypothalamus of the adult rat when compared on the basis of IR-SS. No IR-GRF was detectable in cerebral cortex of the adult rat. At least one cross-reacting molecular species is detected in cerebral cortical cultures by the rGRF RIA, but exhibits nonparallelism and has a higher mol wt than synthetic rGRF. The increase of the ratio of IR-SS/IR-GRF in hypothalamic cell cultures in vitro compared to hypothalamus in vivo suggests that the culture conditions change differentially the expression of IR-SS and IR-GRF.\r"

Approximately 2 months later, the experiment was conducted, and all gilts were given estradiol benzoate (EB; 10 micrograms/kg, im) at 0 h. Controls (n = 6) received im saline 24 and 48 h after EB. Two groups of gilts received 2000 IU hCG im, at 24 h (hCG24; n = 5) or 48 h (hCG48; n = 5) after EB. The fourth group (n = 4) received hCG at 48 h and was then given iv a LHRH agonist (des-Gly10, [D-Ala6]LHRH ethylamide) in 100-ng boluses hourly from 54-96 h after EB. Blood samples for determination of LH and FSH were collected every 6 h from 0-96 h. In controls, EB alone suppressed LH from 3.9 +/- 1.9 ng/ml at 0 h to 1.0 +/- 0.2 during 6-48 h (negative feedback), but LH then increased to 4.5 +/- 0.5 between 54 and 96 h (positive feedback), with the peak of the surge (6.7 +/- 1.6) occurring at 72 h. Treatment with hCG did not alter LH during the negative feedback phase (1.1 +/- 0.1 and 1.0 +/- 0.1 for hCG24 and hCG48, respectively). However, there was no LH surge in gilts given hCG at 24 or 48 h (2.4 +/- 0.2 and 2.2 +/- 0.1 form 54-96 h; P less than 0.05). Hourly injections of the LHRH agonist evoked a surge in LH (8.3 +/- 1.3) and maintained elevated LH (4.5 +/- 0.6) between 54 and 96 h, similar (P greater than 0.05) to values for controls. Generally, FSH in gilts given hCG followed the same pattern as LH secretion during the negative feedback stage; however, due to randomization, means for the period from 0-48 h for gilts treated with hCG 24 or 48 h after EB were lower (P less than 0.05) than for controls or gilts given LHRH agonist (62.2 +/- 2.8 and 63.0 +/- 2.7 vs. 79.3 +/- 3.2 and 93.3 +/- 4.2 ng/ml, respectively). During the positive feedback phase (54-96 h), FSH was lower in gilts given hCG (hCG24, 63.4 +/- 2.3; hCG48, 67.3 +/- 2.0) than in controls (86.0 +/- 4.0), but in gilts given LHRH agonist, FSH was higher (1001.1 +/- 7.7) than in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Using these approaches, the mechanisms that govern Sertoli cell-germ cell membrane recognition were shown to be unaltered by the hypotonic treatment, to vary with the age of the Sertoli cell donors, and to be FSH/(Bu)2cAMP dependent in the younger animals (10-20 days old). Hypotonic treatment had no effect on estradiol levels at all ages studied, but resulted in a marked fall of ABP production by Sertoli cells from 20 days onward. However, the relative stimulation of ABP induced by FSH/(Bu)2cAMP (ABP levels in FSH/(Bu)2cAMP/hypotonically treated Sertoli cell cultures vs. ABP in hypotonically treated cultures) was markedly increased at 20 and 45 days, indicating that germ cells influence Sertoli cell responsiveness to FSH/(Bu)2cAMP. The addition of crude germ cell preparation to the Sertoli cell cultures stimulated ABP and inhibited estradiol levels at all ages studied. Moreover, the addition of germ cells to hypotonically treated cultures induced a decrease in the relative ABP response to FSH and (Bu)2cAMP, thus confirming (see above) that germ cells may be involved in the mechanism of Sertoli cell refractoriness to FSH that occurs with advancing age in the rat. Germ cell-stimulated ABP production was higher in adult Sertoli cells than in immature cells. That Sertoli cell responsiveness to germ cells varies with age is further supported by the data showing that whereas spermatocytes stimulated ABP and inhibited estradiol productions at all ages studied, early spermatids only influenced these parameters from 20 days onward. It is concluded that germ cell control over Sertoli cell function in vitro may be of important physiological significance during Sertoli cell maturation in mammals.\r"

Plasma ANF levels in essential hypertensive patients showed a significant positive correlation with mean arterial pressure (MAP; r = 0.46, p less than 0.05) and an inverse correlation with plasma renin activity (PRA; r = -0.43, p less than 0.05). Plasma ANF levels after medication showed significant correlation with the decrease in MAP (r = 0.565, p less than 0.05). Patients with primary aldosteronism had significantly higher plasma ANF levels (122.4 +/- 30.2 pg/ml, n = 8) than those of controls (p less than 0.05). The levels returned to normal after extirpation of adrenal tumors. The response of plasma ANF levels in patients with primary aldosteronism to volume expansion with infusion of 2 L of physiological saline in 2 hours was greater than in controls. Such exaggerated response disappeared after surgical treatment. Infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II; 20 ng/kg/min) or norepinephrine (200 ng/kg/min) for 30 minutes to normal volunteers (n = 5) resulted in a rise in MAP (24.9 +/- 3.3 and 15.8 +/- 4.4 mm Hg, respectively) and a twofold increase in plasma ANF level. Infusion of the Ang II antagonist [Sar1, Ile8]Ang II (600 ng/kg/min) for 30 minutes, resulted in a rise in MAP (18.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg) and more than a twofold increase in plasma ANF level in patients with essential hypertension (n = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies were conducted to assess the effects of bolus injections and infusions of human atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in control subjects and patients with mild essential hypertension, and to measure plasma immunoreactive ANF (irANF) concentration in a large group of patients with essential hypertension. The results are compared with those obtained by other groups on the measurements of plasma irANF in hypertensive patients. It appears that plasma irANF concentrations are not increased in patients with mild essential hypertension despite the evidence of increased preload and of atrial distention as reported by others. This suggests a hyporesponsiveness of the atria to release ANF.\r"

  ".W": "Because previous data have suggested a dependence of ganglionic atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) content on preganglionic cholinergic input, we investigated the possibility that the increased neural activity observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) may be reflected by ganglionic immunoreactive ANF levels. Four-week-old normotensive SHR had celiac ganglionic immunoreactive ANF values comparable to those of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). When they became hypertensive, however, at 12 weeks of age, the SHR manifested higher immunoreactive ANF levels in celiac ganglia than the WKY group (25.3 +/- 2.6 vs 14.5 +/- 1.7 pg/ganglion; p less than 0.01), but there were no differences in levels in the superior cervical and nodose ganglia. The values in celiac ganglia were quadrupled on the average in hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats under the influence of an 8% salt intake for 5 weeks, but no difference was noted in any of these ganglia between this group and their salt-resistant partners. The celiac and superior cervical ganglionic immunoreactive ANF content in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats was higher with high salt than with normal salt intake. Hypertensive rats treated with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt and sham-treated controls showed immunoreactive ANF concentrations in celiac ganglia similar to those detected in Dahl rats but, again, no differences were found between groups. Thus, hypertensive SHR, compared to WKY, have higher celiac ganglionic immunoreactive ANF levels, unlike Dahl salt-sensitive and DOCA-salt animals relative to their respective controls. This increase is unique to SHR (although all three models have elevated plasma immunoreactive ANF when they are hypertensive) and to the celiac ganglia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the aid of the radioimmunoassays for gamma-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide-(1-25) and for alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide, we detected 290 +/- 35.6 pg/ml of gamma-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide-(1-25)-like immunoreactivity in plasma from healthy humans, while the simultaneously determined plasma alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide-like immunoreactivity level was 20.9 +/- 2.8 pg/ml. Correlation between the two values was significant. High performance gel permeation chromatographic analysis revealed that the plasma gamma-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide-(1-25)-like immunoreactivity was composed of a component (molecular weight, 10,000) without alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide-like immunoreactivity, while the plasma alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide-like immunoreactivity was composed of alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide with a molecular weight of 3000. In patients with heart diseases, the plasma gamma-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide-(1-25)-like immunoreactivity level showed a concomitant and graded increase, with the plasma alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide-like immunoreactivity level in agreement with the severity of the disease.

Administration of angiotensin II in doses of 100 ng and 1 microgram significantly enhanced ANF secretion induced by volume loading with infusion of 3 ml of saline (peak values of the plasma ANF level: control, 220 +/- 57 pg/ml; angiotensin II 100 ng, 1110 +/- 320 pg/ml, p less than 0.01; angiotensin II 1 microgram, 1055 +/- 60 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). Injection of angiotensin II alone had no significant effect on the basal plasma ANF level. Central angiotensin II-induced ANF secretion was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with intravenous administration of the V1-receptor antagonist of vasopressin or intracerebroventricular administration of phentolamine. These results indicate that the brain renin-angiotensin system modulates ANF secretion in response to volume loading through the stimulation of vasopressin secretion or the activation of the central alpha-adrenergic neural pathway.\r"

With high performance liquid chromatography, the elution characteristics of the first immunoreactive peak were the same as those of circulating human ANF. The other two peaks have not been characterized, although one had a position similar to the 126 amino acid rat prohormone (Asn 1-Ile 110-Tyr 126). The time course of release of immunoreactive ANF by perfused human fetal lungs was also studied. It is suggested that ANF may play a role in early pulmonary function.\r"

We reviewed the records of fifty patients who had suspected osteomyelitis or suspected infection about a total joint prosthesis and who underwent scintigraphy with technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate and scintigraphy with indium-111 oxine-labeled white blood cells before an open surgical procedure. Any patient who received preoperative antibiotics was not included in the study. For all of the patients, gram-stain examination of smears, evaluation of a culture of material from the operative site, and histological examination were done. The patients were divided into two groups. Group I was composed of twenty-four patients, each of whom had a prosthesis in place and complained of pain. Group II was composed of twenty-six patients for whom a diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis had to be considered. With the indium scans alone, there was only one false-negative result (in Group II), but there were eighteen false-positive results (eight patients in Group II and ten patients in Group I). Although scintigraphy with indium-labeled white blood cells is quite sensitive, it is not specific in detecting chronic osteomyelitis; a negative scan should be considered highly suggestive that osteomyelitis is not present. Specificity can be increased by interpreting the indium scan in conjunction with the technetium scan.\r"

Joint motion improved by an average of 20 degrees, and it was in an acceptable range in twenty-three patients. There were no complications other than persistence of swelling in six patients.

After 4 weeks, serum gonadotropin levels were less than 10% of pretreatment levels, whereas serum PRL levels did not change. A significant decrease in serum testosterone occurred in 19 of 20 patients; this fall was associated with a 22% fall in serum estradiol levels. Serum androstenedione levels also decreased, but serum estrone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS) levels did not. The lack of fall in serum DHAS levels indicates that the changes in androgen levels were a result of reduced ovarian secretion, and the reduced estradiol levels were a consequence of reduced precursor (i.e. testosterone) availability. The continued dependence of ovarian androgen secretion on gonadotropin stimulation after the menopause may explain the responses of some patients to LHRH agonists and some other therapeutic agents of unknown or uncertain modes of action.\r"

Nine untreated GHD patients, 1 untreated patient with postoperative craniopharyngioma, and 7 normal short children were given synthetic human GHRH-44 (100 micrograms, iv) injection before and 2 days after being given a single dose of 4 IU biosynthetic methionyl human GH (mGH), im. Twelve GHD patients, who had been treated with 0.31-0.48 IU/kg.week pituitary-derived hGH (pdGH), im, for 8-79 months, were given GHRH 2 and 14 days after a final injection of 4 IU pdGH. Three other GHD patients were given GHRH before and after 2 yr of pdGH therapy (0.35-0.39 IU/kg.week). The GHRH-induced GH response (max delta GH) was significantly inhibited after mGH administration in the 9 untreated GHD patients [2.7 +/- 0.3 (+/- SE) vs. 4.7 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L; P less than 0.01]. The patient with secondary GH deficiency also had a marked reduction in her peak plasma GH value after mGH administration (from 32.0 to 11.7 micrograms/L). Similarly, the mean max delta GH response in the 7 normal short children was significantly inhibited by prior mGH injection (max delta GH, 12.7 +/- 2.0 vs. 28.8 +/- 4.8 micrograms/L; P less than 0.01). In the 12 treated GHD patients the GHRH-induced GH response on the 2nd day after discontinuation of pdGH therapy was significantly lower than that on the 14th day (max delta GH, 3.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 6.9 +/- 1.6 micrograms/L; P less than 0.02). In the 3 GHD patients who were studied before and after 2 yrs of pdGH therapy, the plasma GH responses were similar. In each group, plasma somatomedin-C levels on the second day after GH administration were slightly but not significantly higher than those before or 14 days after the administration. The GH responses to GHRH given on 2 occasions at 7- to 14-day intervals in individuals not receiving GH were similar in both 9 normal children and 10 GHD patients. These results indicate that acute GH administration inhibits somatotroph function in GHD patients, but chronic GH therapy does not cause irreversible damage to the somatotrophs. The acute inhibition of GHRH-induced GH release after GH administration is more likely due to direct and indirect pituitary inhibition by somatomedin-C and/or somatostatin than decreased GHRH secretion.\r"

We compared the effects of this therapy with those of gonadal steroid and calcium and of calcium alone in 93 osteoporotic women. Thirty women were treated for 1 yr with ADFR, in the form of K-phosphate (1.5 g/day), for 3 days followed by etidronate, (400 mg/day) for 14 days, followed by 8 weeks of neither drug, plus continuous calcium carbonate therapy (1 g/day). Thirty-six women received conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/day) for 25 days/month plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 mg/day) for 10 days/month and calcium, while 27 women received calcium carbonate (500 mg, twice daily). Sixteen women in the ADFR group, 15 in the calcium group, and 19 in the hormone-calcium group completed 2 yrs of treatment. Spinal bone mineral density was measured by single energy quantitative computerized tomography (QCT) and in the proximal and distal radius by single energy photon absorptiometry. The 3 groups were similar in age, initial bone mass, years since menopause, and dietary calcium intake. After 2 yrs, the mean women in the ADFR therapy group had a mean reduction of 8.0% in spinal QCT (P less than 0.05), and no change in proximal radius mineral content/bone width (BMC), and distal radius BMC. The group treated with calcium only had a decrease of 3.8% in QCT (P less than 0.05), of 5.6% in proximal BMC (P less than 0.05), and of 4.9% in distal BMC (P less than 0.05). The group treated with hormonal replacement and calcium had no change in any of their measurements. The relative bone loss in the spine at the end of the study was greater in the ADFR group than in the hormone-calcium group (P less than 0.05). Bone loss in the calcium group was slightly but not significantly greater than that in the hormone group and lower than that in the ADFR group. In conclusion, these preliminary results indicate that the ADFR regimen using phosphate and etidronate in doses of 1.5 g/day for 3 days and 400 mg/day for 14 days, respectively, is not as effective as hormonal replacement in preventing trabecular bone loss in osteoporosis, nor it is any more effective than calcium supplementation alone.\r"

These were compared to those in 10 women with normal menstrual cycles. Serum inhibin levels were similar in the 5 PCOS women (mean, 199; range, 126-266 U/L) and were not significantly different from those in the normal women during the early follicular phase (227; 100-485 U/L) or midfollicular phase (243; 143-412 U/L) of their cycles. Inhibin levels were higher (P less than 0.001) in the late follicular phase (408; 227-732 U/L), at midcycle (623; 367-1058 U/L), and during the midluteal phase (1245; 898-1727 U/L) in the normal women compared to those in the PCOS group. Serum inhibin levels were also measured in PCOS (n = 8) and infertile (n = 14) women after the rise and subsequent diminished gonadotropin secretion that occurred during LHRH agonist administration. In both groups, serum LH and FSH increased after initiation of LHRH agonist administration; this increase was accompanied by parallel rises in serum estradiol and inhibin before suppression (PCOS women: r = 0.71; P less than 0.001; n = 108; infertile women: r = 0.42; P less than 0.05; n = 163). All hormone levels, including inhibin, decreased during continued LHRH administration. Five PCOS women underwent ovulation induction using combined LHRH agonist and human menopausal gonadotropin administration. Serum estradiol and inhibin rose in parallel in response to exogenous gonadotropins (r = 0.92; P less than 0.001; n = 77). In conclusion, we found no evidence of a primary defect in ovarian inhibin physiology in women with PCOS in terms of either basal or gonadotropin-stimulated (exogenous or endogenous) secretion.\r"

Sleep was monitored by EEG. On postpartum day 10, serum LH concentrations were similar to early follicular phase levels in normal cycling women, while FSH concentrations were lower than early follicular phase levels. Mean LH pulse frequency during each postpartum interval was 3.6 +/- 0.6 (+/- SE), 4.4 +/- 0.6, and 4.1 +/- 0.8 pulses/12 h on postpartum days 10-11, 17-21, and 24-26, respectively. Because mean serum LH levels and LH pulse frequency did not change significantly between postpartum days 10 and 26, the results from the two or three studies in each woman were combined for the purpose of comparing LH pulse characteristics during the waking and sleeping periods. During the waking hours, mean LH pulse frequency (6.1 +/- 0.5 pulses/12 h) was significantly greater than during sleep (4.1 +/- 0.4 pulses/12 h; P less than 0.02). The amplitude of the serum immunoreactive LH pulses (P less than 0.05) and bioactive LH levels (P less than 0.05) were significantly higher during sleep than during the waking period, with five of the eight women having higher sleep-associated immunoreactive LH and bioactive LH levels between postpartum days 17-26. These changes were associated with an increase in the bioactive to immunoactive LH ratio from 3.3 +/- 0.4 (awake) to 4.5 +/- 0.5 (sleep; P less than 0.05). Although serum PRL levels remained elevated during the puerperium, the diurnal pattern of PRL secretion was conserved. With each successive week postpartum, serum PRL concentrations declined. These results suggest that the increment in LH secretion (and, by inference, increased GnRH secretion) during sleep is a feature of postpartum pituitary-ovarian reactivation. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for the increase in GnRH secretion is not known, this hormonal pattern is analogous to that during early puberty and during recovery from anorexia nervosa and hypothalamic amenorrhea. Taken together, these findings provide evidence to support the concept of a centralized preprogrammed scheme for pituitary-gonadal reactivation.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that insulin hypoglycemia-induced GH release is mediated by a decrease in hypothalamic somatostatin (SRIH) secretion was tested by investigating whether insulin administration enhanced the responses of SRIH-sensitive pituitary hormones to hypothalamic hormone stimulation. Eight normal men were given a combined iv injection of GHRH (1 microgram/kg) and TRH (0.3 microgram/kg) on two occasions, on one of which regular insulin (0.1 U/kg, iv) was given 30 min before GHRH-TRH administration. Insulin hypoglycemia augmented the maximal incremental (P less than 0.01) and integrated (P less than 0.025) plasma GH responses to GHRH. In contrast, plasma TSH responses to TRH were diminished by insulin (maximal increment, P less than 0.025; integrated response, P less than 0.05). TRH-stimulated PRL secretion was not altered by prior insulin administration. The enhancement of GH responsiveness to maximal GHRH stimulation indicates mediation by a non-GHRH pathway. However, the discordant decrease in TSH responsiveness to TRH argues against a reduction in hypothalamic SRIH secretion as a mechanism for the action of insulin.\r"

Subjects with symptoms of hives for 3 days per week for at least 6 weeks were initially screened and admitted if no identifiable cause for symptoms could be determined. Patients entered a single-blind placebo period, and if hives of moderate severity were present for at least 3 days during the week, they were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to take terfenadine, 60 mg twice daily, chlorpheniramine, 4 mg three times a day, or placebo for 6 weeks. Data were analyzed for 122 patients. Those patients receiving both active treatments noted significant improvement in symptoms: pruritus, redness, number of hives, and waking hours during which hives were present, at the end of the first day of therapy. Symptom control by terfenadine was statistically superior to placebo during all 6 weeks, as rated by both patients and investigators. However, statistical significance was not achieved for chlorpheniramine at all observation points. Diphenhydramine was permitted as a relief medication for refractory symptoms and was taken by 52% of subjects receiving placebo, 26% taking chlorpheniramine, and only 9% of patients who were receiving terfenadine. In addition to providing superior symptom control, terfenadine caused less drowsiness and fatigue than chlorpheniramine. Terfenadine is a useful therapeutic agent for primary management of chronic idiopathic urticaria.\r"

Use of a single collagenase/hyaluronidase dispersion technique for all tissues has allowed comparisons of reactivity to be made that are free from methodological variations. Mast cells from all tissues examined secreted histamine in response to anti-IgE and calcium ionophore A23187. However, only skin mast cells were responsive to substance P, compound 48/80, poly-L-lysine, and morphine. Activation of human skin mast cells by these nonimmunologic stimuli clearly distinguishes them from the mast cells of human lung, adenoids, tonsils, and colon and is indicative of functional heterogeneity within the human mast cells population. We propose that the presence of functional receptor sites for neuropeptides and basic compounds on skin mast cells that are not present in mast cell populations from mucosal or lymphoid sources reflects a specialized role for these cells in vascular homeostasis.\r"

Articular changes, such as small joint deformities and temporomandibular joint syndrome, alter the ability to self-feed. The inflammatory process may increase metabolic rate. Ingestion, digestion, absorption, and excretion may be compromised by secondary manifestations of the disease. Comprehensive nutrition assessment incorporates evaluation of disease and treatment-specific factors, along with the usual assessment parameters. Abnormal values for certain assessment parameters do not necessarily reflect nutritional status. Treatment methods, including medications, may have an impact on nutritional status, assessment tools, and self-feeding. Nutrition management goals focus on identification and implementation of feeding strategies. Evaluation of the ability to feed oneself includes consideration of functional status, secondary manifestations, and medical treatment. Multiple feeding modalities may be required. Oral supplements, tube feedings, and parenteral nutrition may be employed to meet the nutrition needs of the individual with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Under these conditions the cells produce lymphokines and express high affinity IL-2R but fail to divide, even after the addition of exogenous IL-2. This state results from restimulation of the cells with Ag-Ia molecule complexes approximately 20 h after initiation of culture. It can be prevented by addition of either an anti-Ia or an anti-L3T4 mAb at that time, but not by cyclosporin A, and mimicked in cultures containing low concentrations of antigen by addition at that time of high Ag concentrations or normal stimulatory concentrations of Con A. These observations suggest that restimulation of activated T cell clones 20 h after their initial stimulation prevents them from dividing.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of cell-surface molecules involved in human T cell interaction reveal that differential expression of each of three adhesion molecules (LFA-3, CD2, and LFA-1) subdivides human peripheral blood T cells into major subpopulations. Systematic analysis of the relationship between expression of these and other markers of T cell subsets demonstrates a single major subset of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes distinguished by enhanced expression of LFA-3, CD2, LFA-1, and three other markers (CDw29 [4B4], UCHL1, and Pgp-1). Large differences in relative expression are observed for UCHL1 (29-fold) and LFA-3 (greater than 8-fold), and smaller differences (2- to 4-fold) are seen for CDw29, CD2, LFA-1, and Pgp-1. Bimodal distribution of LFA-3 is found on both CD4+ cells and on CD8+ cells as well as on B lymphocytes (CD19+). Neonatal T cells (CD3+) are comprised almost exclusively of the subset expressing low LFA-3, CD2, LFA-1, CDw29, and UCHL1. Activation of cord peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes with PHA leads to uniform enhanced expression of each of these molecules on CD3+ cells. Functional analyses of these T cell subsets were performed after sorting of adult T cells based on differential LFA-3 expression. Only the LFA-3+ subset proliferated in response to the Ag tetanus toxoid, even though the LFA-3- subset proliferated more strongly to PHA. Furthermore, the LFA-3+ subset made greater than fivefold more IFN-gamma than the LFA-3- subset in response to PHA, despite the fact that both subsets made equivalent amounts of IL-2. This phenotypic and functional analysis of resting and activated newborn and adult T cells indicates that human memory T cells express enhanced levels of LFA-3, CD2, LFA-1, UCHL1, CDw29, and Pgp-1; we speculate that the increase in expression of T cell adhesion molecules LFA-3, CD2, and LFA-1 on memory cells is functionally important in their enhanced responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Control of entry into and progression through the early phases of cell cycle in B lymphocytes is poorly understood at the molecular level. Products of the c-fos proto-oncogene have been implicated in regulation of G0 to G1 cell cycle phase transition and cell proliferation in other systems. In view of these observations, the relationship between signals generated through receptor Ig which alter the B cells position in cell cycle and relative level of c-fos expression was investigated. Not unexpectantly, anti-Ig under conditions which promote G0-G1 and G1-S phase transition was observed to selectively up-regulate expression of c-fos. More interestingly, however, anti-Ig-induced cross-linking of surface Ig on the WEHI-231 B lymphoma also caused rapid and transient up-regulation of c-fos mRNA levels although it was associated with inhibition of proliferation of these cells. These results are important because they show that 1) c-fos expression is inducible in both normal and transformed B lymphocytes as a consequence of signals generated through receptor Ig, and 2) up-regulation of c-fos expression is not positively linked to B cell proliferation but rather appears to be a component of the surface Ig signal transduction mechanism. Finally, studies utilizing phorbol diesters suggest that pathways leading through protein kinase C are involved in both the growth inhibition and c-fos expression WEHI-231 following membrane-associated Ig cross-linking.\r"

  ".W": "Putative early thymocytes, the Ly-2-L3T4-(CD8-CD4-) cells representing 3 to 4% of adult CBA mouse thymic lymphocytes, were isolated in high purity (99.5%). They were then stained by using mAb and analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of six additional surface antigenic markers. Cross-correlation of the data obtained from a complete series of successive two-parameter analyses revealed the existence of about 11 discrete subsets, falling into four-main groups, within the Ly-2-L3T4- population. All subsets consisted of relatively large lymphoid cells. The most numerous group of Ly-2-L3T4- cells was Ly-1 low B2A2-M1/69 high Thy-1 high Pgp-1 low and by these markers resembled Ly-2+L3T4+ cortical blasts. Many of the cells in this group were positive for the IL-2R and/or for MEL-14. A second major group of Ly-2-L3T4- cells was Ly-1 high B2A2-M1/69 low Pgp-1 high, and resembled in some respects activated mature T cells. This group had previously been shown to be absent from the embryonic thymus. The group could be divided into Thy-1 high and Thy-1 low subsets. None of the cells in this group were positive for the IL-2R and very few expressed MEL-14. A third group, 13% of the Ly-2-L3T4- population, was Ly-1 low B2A2-M1/69 low Pgp-1 high, and could also be divided into Thy-1 high and Thy-1 low subsets. A final minor group, 9% of the Ly-2-L3T4- population, was Ly-1 high B2A2-M1/69 high Pgp-1 low Thy-1 high. The particular pattern of markers on these subsets, combined with subsequent information on their properties, makes it unlikely that they all represent sequential steps in one continuous developmental stream, and indicates that complex developmental steps have occurred, even at this supposedly early stage of T cell differentiation.\r"

After 3 wk, a high reverse transcriptase activity was continuously detected in the supernatant of the cell line. Neither cytopathic effects nor changes in cell growth were observed. After infection, accessory cell function on T cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3 mAb of both IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses and Con A was tested. Accessory cell function provided by U937 cells started to decline 3 wk after inoculation with HIV. This correlated with detectable reverse transcriptase activity. The remaining accessory cell capacity varied between 10 and 60% of accessory cell function mediated by noninfected U937 cells. It was excluded that decreased FcR expression on U937/HIV cells contributed to the accessory cell defect in the anti-CD3-driven system. IL-2R expression on T cells, cocultivated with U937/HIV and anti-CD3, was minimal. The accessory cell defect could only be partly overcome by addition of rIL-2 or IL-1. Addition of high titer (10(4) TCID50) HIV or U937/HIV cells did not affect T cell proliferation, which rules out that the observed inhibition is caused by HIV infection of T cells or suppressive effects of U937/HIV cells. These results suggest that infection of APC may contribute to the induction of immunologic abnormalities in early HIV infection. Thus, monocytes/macrophages may not only serve as a reservoir for the dissemination of HIV, but may be an important target cell through which the immune system is affected.\r"

SJL/J mice showed a highly aggressive and 100% lethal form of the disease; C57BL/6J mice were much less susceptible as they had low morbidity rates (20 to 40%), low disease scores, and mostly no mortality. Treatment of these low susceptibility mice with neutralizing mAb against IFN-gamma caused an increase in morbidity rates as well as significant mortality (up to 80%). Similar antibody treatment did not affect the course of the disease in the high susceptibility SJL/J mice. However, treatment of these mice with IFN-gamma resulted in reduced morbidity and mortality. A similar but less pronounced inhibition of the disease in SJL/J mice could be obtained by administration of IFN-alpha/beta or by acute infection with lactate dehydrogenase virus. The results indicate that endogenous as well as exogenous IFN can exert a down-regulating effect on the development of EAE. They also indicate that endogenous IFN-gamma is produced during the development of EAE and plays a disease-limiting role.\r"

The results demonstrate that both TNF were capable of enhancing the cytostatic and cytolytic activity of murine peritoneal macrophages against Eb lymphoma cells. The potentiation of tumor cytotoxicity became apparent when macrophages from DBA/2 mice were suboptimally activated by either a T cell clone-derived macrophage-activating factor or by IFN-gamma plus LPS. Neither TNF-alpha nor TNF-beta could induce tumor cytotoxicity in IFN-gamma-primed macrophages, indicating that TNF cannot replace LPS as a triggering signal of activation. In LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ macrophages, which were unresponsive to IFN-gamma plus LPS, a supplementation with TNF fully restored activation to tumor cytotoxicity. Furthermore, TNF-alpha potentiated a variety of other functions in low-level activated macrophages such as a lactate production and release of cytotoxic factors. At the same time, TNF-alpha produced a further down-regulation of pinocytosis, tumor cell binding and RNA synthesis observed in activated macrophages. These data demonstrate new activities for both TNF-alpha and TNF-beta as helper factors that facilitate macrophage activation. In particular, the macrophage product TNF-alpha may serve as an autocrine signal to potentiate those macrophage functions that were insufficiently activated by lymphokines.\r"

  ".W": "We produced the T cell hybridoma D9C1.12.17 by fusing an IL-4-producing T cell clone D9.1Hi with the AKR thymoma BW5147. The resulting hybridoma produced IL-2 as well as IL-4 even though none of the parental cells produced IL-2 after stimulation with Con A. The production of IL-2 was confirmed at the mRNA level by using an S1 nuclease protection assay. Further analysis indicated that Con A-induced IL-2 production was a common phenomenon among T cell hybridomas derived from this fusion. Although BW5147 does not produce detectable lymphokines after Con A stimulation, this line was able to produce IL-2, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, and small amounts of IL-3 and IFN-gamma when stimulated with calcium ionophore and phorbol ester. The latter agents are thought to mimic the activating signal(s) delivered through the Ag:MHC TCR. This observation indicates that BW5147 has the ability to produce lymphokines but may lack component(s) which couple the extracellular signal to lymphokine production, and suggests that in T cell hybridomas, part of the spectrum of lymphokines produced may be contributed by BW5147.\r"

M111 was expressed constitutively in subsets of cells of multiple lineages at discrete stages of cell maturation, suggesting that M111 is a differentiation Ag of the three germ layers. Ag expression could be induced by IFN-gamma but not by IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, or TNF. Induction of M111 expression was maximal at 48 h of culture in 200 U/ml of IFN-gamma and was independent of induction of class II MHC Ag. Induction was dependent on the cell type used. Nine colon cancer cell lines of undifferentiated phenotype were constitutively M111-; IFN-gamma induced M111 expression in seven of them. In contrast, IFN-gamma failed to induce M111 expression in six of six M111- ovarian cancer cell lines. Eight normal fibroblast cultures tested were M111-; they could not be induced to express M111. Three of five sarcoma cell lines were M111+; culture in IFN-gamma induced an increase in M111 expression in all of them. Constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced expression of M111 was independent of constitutive and induced expression of HLA class I and II molecules. IFN-gamma-mediated induction of M111 expression was not accompanied by coordinate changes in the expression of other differentiation traits. These results suggest that expression of the M111 gene is controlled by two mechanisms, one related to differentiation and the other activated by IFN-gamma.\r"

We have obtained two murine anti-human lambda-chain mAb, 14G1 and 14D1, that recognize antigenic determinants specific for the C lambda isotypes Mcg and Oz, respectively. These antisera have been used to classify as Mcg+/Mcg- or Oz+/Oz- monoclonal lambda-chains (Bence Jones proteins) and intact Ig lambda proteins. There was complete concordance between the chemical and serologic assignment of lambda-chains as Mcg+/Mcg- or as Oz+/Oz-; no single protein expressed both isotypes. There was no evident association between the C region isotype Mcg or Oz and the V region subgroup of the protein tested. However, our finding that four of seven amyloid-associated lambda VI Bence Jones proteins were Oz+ suggests a predominant expression of the C lambda 3 gene product among proteins of this uncommon V lambda subgroup.\r"

PAF was produced after stimulation by calcium ionophore A23187 (IoA), opsonized zymosan (OpsZ), and PMA with a relative order of potency IoA much greater than OpsZ greater than PMA. The portion of PAF subsequently released from the cell was dependent on the specific agonist, the time of incubation, and the presence of albumin. Under optimal conditions, PBM released 67, 49 and 32% of the total PAF produced in response to IoA, OpsZ, and PMA, respectively. Changes in PAF metabolism were observed in PBM that were examined after short term adherence or differentiation into macrophages. Adherent PBM accumulated and released less PAF than suspended monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages produced less PAF than the parent PBM. The ability of monocytes to release significant amounts of newly synthesized PAF from the cell is unusual among human cell types, which in general retain the vast majority of the lipid, and may be of particular pathophysiologic importance.\r"

However, THP-1, a monocytic cell line, could be infected by HCMV with a full cycle of replication after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which produced differentiation of the cell line into cells with characteristics of mature macrophages. Late (structural) Ag were demonstrated, as were infectious virions as detected by electron microscopy and infectious center assay. HL-60, a promyelocytic cell line, was not susceptible to HCMV infection after treatment with TPA despite differentiation into adherent cells with properties of macrophages, suggesting that cellular lineage was important. Treatment with TPA after infection resulted in a greatly reduced frequency of infected cells, suggesting that pretreatment was essential. Furthermore, continued presence of TPA was unnecessary after differentiation was induced. This study establishes the precedent of productive HCMV infection in human monocytic cells. The potential mechanism and relevance of enhanced replication induced by TPA are discussed.\r"

Twenty-two of the cosmid clones were grouped into seven distinct clusters. The VH genes were separated by an average of 8 kb, although some were separated by less than 3 kb. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of two of these VH genes with the sequences of another 11 VH genes showed that they were all generally more than 80% homologous suggesting that rabbit VH genes are members of one highly homologous gene family. Most rabbit Ig molecules have the VH allotypic specificities a1, a2, or a3 and are designated VHa-positive. A small number (less than 30%) of Ig molecules lack these VHa allotypic specificities and are designated VHa-negative. The VH containing cosmid clones were hybridized with synthetic oligomer probes designed to be specific for genes encoding VHa-positive or VHa-negative molecules. At least 50% of the germ-line VH genes hybridized with the VHa-negative oligomer and thus presumably encode VHa-negative molecules; as few as 15% of the genes could be identified as encoding VHa-positive molecules based on hybridization with the VHa-positive oligomer. Approximately 35% of the VH genes did not hybridize with either oligomer and could not be classified as VHa-negative or VHa-positive. We propose that the predominance of serum VHa-positive molecules, in contrast to the predominance of VHa-negative encoding germ-line genes, may reflect preferential usage of a few germline VH genes. The implications of this idea toward explaining the allelic inheritance of VHa allotypes are discussed.\r"

We have investigated the mechanism by which IFN-gamma increases mRNA levels for class II MHC antigens in human cells. For this purpose, we have studied the effect of IFN-gamma on HLA-DR-alpha transcription rate in two different human cell types: VAL melanoma and JDA2 skin fibroblasts. HLA-DR-alpha mRNA is spontaneously produced in VAL cells and its level is enhanced upon IFN-gamma treatment. We demonstrate here that IFN-gamma increases the transcription of HLA-DR-alpha gene in this cell line. However, the discrepancy observed between HLA-DR-alpha mRNA and transcriptional rates led us to postulate that IFN-gamma also regulates the HLA-DR-alpha gene post-transcriptionally. In the course of these experiments, we found also that human skin fibroblasts, which do not contain detectable amounts of HLA-DR-alpha mRNA, spontaneously transcribe the HLA-DR-alpha gene.\r"

IgA+ cells of the I.29 lymphoma were derived from the IgM+ cells by a typical H chain switch recombination event. The IgM+ cells can be induced with LPS to undergo H chain switching in culture. It has been proposed that the somatic hypermutation process is activated during H chain switch, since V genes expressed in IgG+ and IgA+ cells have more frequently undergone mutation than those expressed in IgM+ cells. We have investigated this question by sequencing VH genes expressed before and after H chain switch in the I.29 lymphoma. We have also sequenced the germ-line VH gene corresponding to the gene expressed by I.29 cells to determine whether the VH gene expressed in the IgM+ cells had already undergone somatic mutation. Our results indicate that somatic mutation was not activated in the precursor cell for the I.29 lymphoma, nor during isotype switch in I.29 cells. It is possible that cells of the I.29 lymphoma, or their precursor, have not received the signal which induces somatic mutation, or that I.29 cells belong to a subset of B cells that cannot be induced to undergo any (or much) somatic mutation.\r"

The stimulatory moiety for three of these clones correlates, in part, with expression of Mlsc, as defined by mouse strains C3H/HeJ and A/J. In addition, all three of these clones are stimulated by cells from strain PL/J, which has the poorly defined Mlsx allele. The data strongly suggest that Mlsx may, in fact, be Mlsc or is, at least, highly cross-reactive with Mlsc. Segregation analysis by using (B10.D2 X PL/J)F2 mice demonstrates that the Mlsx gene is genetically independent of the Mlsa linked Ly-9 marker on chromosome 1. Further studies with the use of these Mlsc,x-reactive clones reveal that they also recognize a gene product present in many mouse strains including DBA/2 which were previously phenotyped as Mlsa. However, testing of BxD recombinant inbred lines excludes Mlsa as being the stimulatory moiety. We therefore propose reclassification of the Mls phenotypes of several mouse strains based upon a two-locus model for Mls.\r"

  ".U": "88154480\r", 
  ".W": "Molecule CD28 (Tp44) is expressed on the surface of majority of human T cells and has been implicated to play an active role in the regulation of T cell growth. The present study examines the effect of antibody binding to the CD28 molecule during T cell activation. Anti-CD28 but not isotype-matched anti-CD5 mAb consistently augmented anti-CD3-induced and IL-2-induced T cell proliferation and subsequent release of soluble CD25 molecule. When added together, mAb anti-CD28 and anti-CD5 acted synergistically to cause 2- to 7-fold enhancement of T cell activation induced by anti-CD3 mAb or IL-2 with no effect on the development of non-MHC-restricted IL-2-activated killer T cells. In contrast, alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation, soluble CD25 release, and the subsequent development of CTL were all inhibited by anti-CD28 mAb. Moreover, alloantigen-induced proliferative response of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was inhibited by anti-CD28 without affecting the cytolytic effect of CTL. Because valency of anti-CD28 binding has been implicated as an important factor in signal transduction, this was explored in the allogeneic MLR by using Fab and F(ab')2 fragments of anti-CD28 mAb and anti-mouse kappa mAb. The inhibitory effect of anti-CD28 mAb in the MLR was reversed by cross-linking of anti-CD28 mAb with anti-mouse kappa mAb. In addition, cross-linking of the CD28 molecule on alloactivated T lymphoblasts but not that on resting T cells with anti-CD28 and anti-mouse kappa induced their proliferation in the absence of the priming alloantigen. These results indicate that stimulatory or inhibitory signals delivered through the CD28 molecule are determined by the degree of cross-linking of this molecule. In addition, these results also suggest that Ag-induced CD3-TCR-mediated T cell responses are more dependent on signals delivered through the CD28 molecule than those induced with anti-CD3, and thus these results have implications for potential use of anti-CD28 in sustained propagation of Ag-specific T cells.\r"

  ".U": "88154482\r", 
  ".W": "Models for T cell:B cell collaboration suggest that activated B cells process and present Ag to Th cells which subsequently induce B cell proliferation and differentiation. In contrast to activated B cells, resting B cells have generally been shown to be less efficient APC. If this model of T:B collaboration is physiologically correct, then resting B cells must undergo a phenotypic change that permits effective interaction with T cells. In this report, the requirement for rapid signaling through surface Ig on resting B cells for the induction of T:B interaction was investigated with an in vitro clustering assay. Resting splenic B cells were unable to form specific conjugates with T cell clones, unless the B cells were first treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid. In contrast, LPS-activated B cells were able to form conjugates without prior treatment. The ability of antibody against LFA-1 or L3T4 to inhibit cluster formation depended on the state of B cell activation in that anti-LFA-1 and anti-L3T4 mAb inhibited cluster formation by neuraminidase-treated resting B cells, but not by LPS-activated B cells. In addition, Ag-specific B cells which were isolated by their capacity to bind specific Ag were able to form clusters without any additional treatment. Moreover, treatment of resting splenic B cells with anti-mu-antibody induced clustering potential in B cells in as little as 10 min, suggesting that signaling through surface Ig was sufficient to induce this phenotypic change in B cells. Furthermore, activation of protein kinase C and Ca2+ mobilization were shown to be involved in that PMA and ionomycin treatment were also able to induce clustering potential in resting B cells. The rapid induction of clustering potential in resting B cells after signaling through surface Ig may represent a fundamental change in B cell physiology which occurs after recognition of specific Ag and may be required for effective cognate recognition between resting hapten-specific B cells and carrier-specific T cells. The potential role of desialylation for the induction of T:B interaction is discussed.\r"

The subjects were further classified as bearing or not bearing the HLA-DR4 phenotype, since this specificity is regarded as a genetic determinant commonly associated with RA. The mycobacterial extract induced significantly higher proliferative responses in lymphocytes from all HLA-DR4 positive as compared to HLA-DR4 negative subjects regardless of whether they had RA or not. This response was maximal at day 6 of incubation and could be abrogated by anti-DR/DQ mAb added to the culture. SDS-PAGE of this extract revealed three major protein bands located at Mr 14, 47, and 65 kDa. After fractionation, Western blotting, and resuspension of protein-laden nitrocellulose particles, only the 14- and 47-kDa proteins retained the original proliferative capacity of the mycobacterial extract. The band separating with a Mr of 47 kDa was found to be the most strongly associated with the HLA-DR4 restricted lymphocyte proliferation, and represents a newly identified M. tuberculosis Ag of relevance in T cell responses. These data provide insight into the pathogenic potential of certain bacterial Ag which could trigger or perpetuate inflammatory disorders when presented in the appropriate genetical background.\r"

Consistent with this concept, evaluation of the expression of the IL-2R on fresh lung T cells from individuals with active sarcoidosis demonstrated that 7 +/- 1% of sarcoid lung CD4+ T cells are spontaneously expressing the IL-2R compared with only 1 +/- 1% lung CD8+ T cells (p less than 0.01). However, stimulation of purified sarcoid blood CD8+ T cells with the anti-T3/TCR complex mAb OKT3 was followed by the normal expression of IL-2R (p greater than 0.1) and proliferation (p greater than 0.1). In addition, lung sarcoid CD8+ T cells responded to OKT3 similarly to normal lung CD8+ T cells and to autologous blood CD8+ T cells as regards expression of IL-2R (p greater than 0.1) and proliferation (p greater than 0.1). Finally, using CD4+ cells activated with allogenic Ag to induce, in coculture, fresh autologous CD8+ cells to suppress proliferation of fresh autologous CD4+ cells to the same Ag, sarcoid CD8+ T cells suppressed CD4+ cell proliferation in a normal fashion (p greater than 0.1). These results demonstrate that sarcoid CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cells are competent to respond to a proliferation signal normally and can be induced to normally suppress CD4+ T cell proliferation to Ag, suggesting that the expansion of activated CD4+ T cells in pulmonary sarcoidosis is not due to a generalized abnormality of CD8+ T cells or of their suppressor T cell function.\r"

They were both detected by using radiolabeled ligand-binding methods which are one to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than flow cytometry analysis. No binding sites with low affinity for IL-2 could be detected on untreated or treated cells. However, a change was noted in the number of IL-2 binding sites with intermediate affinity (Kd approximately 1000 pM), which increased from 54,000 to 67,000 sites per cell. This binding affinity is equivalent to that of the p70 IL-2-binding protein detected on YT cells and on large granular lymphocytes by other investigators. This suggests that the increase in the Tac peptide was the limiting factor in the combination of the Tac and p70 components to form the high affinity IL-2R. The corollary is that all new Tac molecules were incorporated into these R. The IL-1 treatment also induced an increase in production of Tac mRNA as detected by Northern blots. Comparison of the relative amounts of Tac mRNA by dot blots verified the quantitative difference between treated and untreated cells. These data demonstrate that the IL-1-induced positive regulation of the Tac protein and high affinity IL-2R on YTN10 cells may operate at the level of gene transcription.\r"

  ".W": "Mucosal mast cells (MMC) were isolated from the intestine of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-infected rats and then activated with Ag or with anti-IgE in order to assess their metabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotriene (LT) C4, LTB4, and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). After challenge of MMC preparations of 19 +/- 1% purity with five worm equivalents of N. brasiliensis Ag, the net formation of immunoreactive equivalents of LTC4, LTB4, and PGD2 was 58 +/- 8.3, 22 +/- 4.5, and 22 +/- 3.4 ng/10(6) mast cells, respectively (mean +/- SE, n = 7). When MMC preparations of 56 +/- 9% purity were activated by Ag, the net generation of immunoreactive equivalents of LTC4, LTB4, and PGD2/10(6) MMC was 107 +/- 15, 17 +/- 5.4, and 35 +/- 18 ng, respectively. These data indicate that the three eicosanoids originated from the MMC rather than from a contaminating cell. Analysis by reverse phase HPLC of the C-6 sulfidopeptide leukotrienes present in the supernatants of the activated MMC preparations of lower purity revealed LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. In a higher purity MMC preparation only LTC4 was present, suggesting that other cell types in the mucosa are able to metabolize LTC4 to LTD4 and LTE4. The release of histamine and the generation of eicosanoids from intestinal MMC and from peritoneal cavity-derived connective tissue-type mast cells (CTMC) isolated from the same N. brasiliensis-infected rats were compared. When challenged with anti-IgE, these MMC released 165 +/- 41 ng of histamine/10(6) mast cells, and generated 29 +/- 3.6, 12 +/- 4.2, and 4.7 +/- 1.0 ng (mean +/- SE, n = 3) of immunoreactive equivalents of LTC4, LTB4, and PGD2/10(6) mast cells, respectively. In contrast, CTMC isolated from the same animals and activated with the same dose of anti-IgE released approximately 35 times more histamine (5700 +/- 650 ng/10(6) CTMC), generated 7.5 +/- 2.3 ng of PGD2/10(6) mast cells, and failed to release LTC4 or LTB4. These studies establish, that upon immunologic activation, rat MMC and CTMC differ in their quantitative release of histamine and in their metabolism of arachidonic acid to LTC4 and LTB4.\r"

  ".U": "88154510\r", 
  ".W": "Although a variety of agonists have the capacity to stimulate the release of endogenous arachidonic acid (AA) from macrophage lipids and its subsequent metabolism to both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase eicosanoids, including leukotrienes (LT), previous work suggests that exogenously supplied arachidonate is metabolized preferentially to cyclooxygenase products and mono-hydroxyeicosatetranenoic acids rather than LT. We have compared the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous AA in cultured rat alveolar macrophages and have further examined the effect of exogenous fatty acids on eicosanoid synthesis stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187 and the particulate agonist zymosan. As reported by others, exogenous AA was metabolized to large amounts of cyclooxygenase products, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, but far lesser amounts of all 5-lipoxygenase products. However, whereas exogenous AA augmented the synthesis of cyclooxygenase metabolites in both A23187- and zymosan-stimulated cells, it dose-dependently inhibited the synthesis of LT. Inasmuch as unsaturated fatty acids, including AA, uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, and because 5-lipoxygenase activity depends on ATP, we examined the possibility that ATP depletion was responsible for the inhibition of LT synthesis by exogenous AA. Arachidonate depleted cellular ATP in a dose-dependent fashion similar to its inhibition of LT synthesis. In addition, the other unsaturated fatty acids, linolenic and eicosatrienoic, but not the saturated fatty acids, palmitic or stearic, both depleted ATP and inhibited A23187-induced LT synthesis. These data suggest that the relative lack of synthesis of LT from exogenous AA is related to the ability of this unsaturated fatty acid to function as an inhibitor, as well as a substrate, of 5-lipoxygenase. Our results further suggest that this inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase may be mediated by ATP depletion.\r"

Because the identity of plasmodial Ag responsible for the activation of these protective immune responses remains unknown, a major step in isolating these potential immunizing agents will be the development of adequate screening procedures designed to identify important T cell Ag. This study focused on the isolation of protective T cell clones that may play a pivotal role in this process. A T cell clone designated CTR2.1 and two subclones derived from it adoptively transferred protection to athymic nude mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi adami, a murine malarial parasite known to be recognized by protective thymus-dependent immune mechanisms. The protective T cell clone displayed a L3T4+, Lyt-2- surface phenotype and secreted both IFN-gamma and IL-2 after stimulation with solubilized parasites in vitro. This is the first report of results demonstrating a cloned T cell line capable of providing adoptive protection against malaria in vivo. More importantly, CTR2.1 and other protective T cell clones may provide for the identification of plasmodial antigenic epitopes recognized by important cell-mediated immune mechanisms during acute malarial infection.\r"

The current studies indicate that T cells which inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro and protect granulocytopenic mice from P. aeruginosa infection can be generated by exposure of BALB/c mice to as few as 10(2) live bacteria without simultaneous administration of vinblastine. The in vitro inhibition of bacterial growth and mouse protection are P. aeruginosa immunotype specific. Exposure to 10(6) live bacteria is required to elicit a detectable antibody response.

The mechanism of this trans-activation is not understood, but is of considerable interest as an example of transcription regulation through a cellular intermediate. We have therefore studied the effect of E1A products on the activity of the kappa L chain gene promoter and enhancer. By using transient and stable transfections into lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells, we found that the E1A proteins have a pleiotropic effect on the regulation of the mouse kappa-chain gene enhancer. In lymphoid cells the E1A products repress kappa-chain enhancer, whereas in fibroblasts, the kappa-chain enhancer is activated by the E1A products whether the E1A gene is in an extrachromosomal location or stably integrated in the genome. Furthermore, a functional kappa-chain promoter, containing the octanucleotide and \"TATA\" sequences is needed in order to be transcribed in E1A-producing cells. This ability of E1A products to negatively and positively regulate kappa-chain transcription may reflect a more general phenomenon in which a given cellular protein could participate in a variety of different cellular controls.\r"

  ".W": "The sensitivity of H-2b-high and H-2b-low variants of BL6 melanoma to the cytotoxic action of NK and lymphokine-activated killer cells was investigated. BL6 mouse melanoma cells lack detectable H-2Kb and had low levels of expression of H-2Db Ag. The BL6T2 variant cells, obtained after treatment of BL6 cells with mutagen N-methyl-N-nitro-N'-nitro-soguanidine, had relatively high levels of expression of class I H-2b Ag. Poly(I:C)-stimulated spleen cells of nude mice were highly cytotoxic for BL6T2, whereas H-2b-low BL6 cells were less sensitive to NK activity in an 18-h 51Cr-release assay. Similar results were obtained after 4-h incubation of radio-labeled tumor cells with IL-2-activated effector cells. In contrast, both lines were equally sensitive to lysis by purified granules derived from rat large granular lymphocytes (LGL) or by macrophages. By using various clones selected from BL6 or BL6T2 cells, it was found that BL6 or BL6T2 clones with low H-2b Ag expression were less sensitive to lysis by NK cells than H-2b-high clones. After IFN treatment of either BL6 or BL6T2, the target cells became more resistant to lysis by either NK cells or by purified LGL granules. IFN-treated BL6 cells had substantially increased expression of H-2b Ag and in this respect became similar to untreated BL6T2. However, IFN-treated BL6 cells were more resistant than BL6T2 cells to lysis by NK cells and LGL granules, suggesting that augmentation of H-2b Ag expression and NK resistance could be two independent IFN-induced effects. With a cold target inhibition assay, it was found that BL6T2 or its H-2 positive clones were highly competitive and inhibited the cytotoxic activity of NK and lymphokine-activated killer cells against radiolabeled YAC-1 and BL6T2, whereas BL6 cells or H-2-negative clones of BL6T2 and BL6 lines showed poor competitive ability. Thus, our data indicate that the NK resistance of H-2-low BL6 cells may be due to a paucity of NK recognizable determinants. N-Methyl-N-nitro-N'-nitroguanidine treatment of BL6 melanoma cells was associated with an increase in class I H-2b Ag expression and NK sensitivity, suggesting the involvement of class I MHC Ag in the sensitivity of tumor cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The specific binding of radioiodinated rIL-2 to fresh marrow blasts from T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients was initially investigated. The estimated number of radioiodinated rIL-2 molecules bound per blast ranged from undetectable to 1948. In colony assays, 72% of 32 cases analyzed showed a significant proliferative response to rIL-2, which depended on PHA-stimulated lymphocyte conditioned medium activation. Colony stimulation indices correlated with the number of radioiodinated rIL-2 molecules bound per blast but not with expression of CD25/Tac Ag on fresh marrow blasts or primary colony blasts. These findings provide evidence that in T-lineage ALL functional IL-2R proteins are expressed on leukemic progenitor blasts which may be distinct from Tac Ag. We used the mAb 35.1, T101, and G3.7 to test for expression of CD2, CD5, and CD7 on fresh marrow blasts from 126 T-lineage ALL patients. CD2, CD5, and CD7 were expressed in 84%, 93%, and 99% of cases, respectively. Furthermore, colony blasts that represent the early progeny of leukemic progenitor blasts were also CD2+CD5+CD7+. Ricin conjugates of 35.1, T101, and G3.7 mAb were used as Ag-specific cytotoxic probes to test for expression of CD2, CD5, and CD7 at the level of T-lineage leukemic progenitor blasts. Each immunotoxin was able to selectively eliminate greater than 99% of leukemic progenitor blasts, providing unique and direct evidence that these cells co-express CD2, CD5, and CD7. Neither mixtures of anti-CD5 and anti-CD7 nor anti-CD2, anti-CD5, and anti-CD7 immunotoxins were more effective against blast progenitor cells than the individual immunotoxins alone, confirming that CD2, CD5, and CD7 are not expressed on non-overlapping progenitor cell subpopulations.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether expression of novel class I TSTA and expression of endogenous class I antigens in UV-1591 are regulated independently or coordinately. Expression of both TSTA and H-2Kk antigens increased simultaneously after treatment of UV-1591 cells with either 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-azaC) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Furthermore, the kinetics and pattern of increased expression by 5-azaC and IFN-gamma were identical for both TSTA and H-2Kk antigens. The increased expression of TSTA and class I antigens induced by 5-azaC treatment was constitutive and did not require the continued presence of the drug. In contrast, the increased expression after IFN-gamma treatment was transient and required the continued presence of IFN-gamma. Neither 5-azaC nor IFN-gamma caused induction of class II antigens in UV-1591 tumor cells. These results indicate that expression of TSTA and class I antigens in UV-1591 tumor is coordinately regulated, whereas expression of class I and class II antigens is independently regulated.\r"

Incubation of large pieces of mouse skin in a 20mM EDTA, 15 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in normal saline for 3-4 h at 37 degrees C resulted in a tissue which easily separated at the epidermal-dermal junction. The resulting tissue contains stratum corneum and epidermis, which are the same layers used in studies with human skin in vitro. The EDTA treatment did not effect diffusion of [2-14C]diazepam across whole mouse skin (SCE and dermis) used as controls. The rate of drug diffusion was greater across SCE than SCE and dermis, however, 0.48-1.12 micrograms/cm2/h versus 0.11-0.52 microgram/cm/h, respectively. The permeability coefficients for mouse SCE ranged from 1.92-4.48 X 10(-2) cm/h. The lag times and diffusion coefficients were 0.36-0.91 h and 0.1-0.6 X 10(-6) cm2/h, respectively. The presence of the dermis decreased the diffusion rate or flux of diazepam. The dermis appears to accumulate drug until it is saturated and then the drug diffuses into the receiving chamber.\r"

We have investigated the release of histamine and eicosanoids from isolated spleen cells obtained from tissue of a mastocytosis patient undergoing therapeutic splenectomy. Dispersed cell preparations contained lymphocytes 65.9%, monocytes/macrophages 22.3%, neutrophils 9.9%, mast cells 1.1%, and eosinophils 0.8%; upon challenge with 0.1-3.0 microM A23187 they released histamine much greater than PGD2 greater than TXB2 greater than LTB4 greater than LTC4 approximately equal to LTD4 greater than LTE4. With immunological activation of passively sensitized cells, histamine and PGD2 release had similar dose-response characteristics, but TXB2, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 release differed in reaching maximum at 50 micrograms/ml and declining at 125 micrograms/ml anti-human IgE. Percoll centrifugation separated most of the histamine-containing cells to the middle of the gradient, but they were refractory to release with 0.3 microM A23187 or 50 micrograms/ml anti-IgE. Spontaneous release of histamine from these cells was not abnormally high (1.3%-4.5%). Electron microscopy of tissue sections revealed large numbers of mast cells with empty granules. It is possible that the refractory cells observed are such mast cells where intracellular histamine is no longer granule-associated. Most net histamine and PGD2 release was confined to cells at the bottom of the gradients (1.078-1.09 g/ml), although some release of PGD2 occurred near the top (1.05-1.058 g/ml). There was a significant correlation between the net release of histamine and PGD2 with both immunological (r = 0.92; n = 16) and A23187 (r = 0.97, n = 14) activation. These studies provide evidence for a link between PGD2 and histamine release in mastocytosis spleen cells.\r"

Therefore, we used this fragment as a probe in Southern hybridization to compare pre- and post-therapy isolates of P. aeruginosa. The susceptible and resistant pairs were recovered from multiple sources (including sputum, blood, and urine) from patients treated with various doses of imipenem (n = 15), norfloxacin (n = 6), and ciprofloxacin (n = 4). Southern blot analysis showed identity between the pre- and post-therapy isolates in 23 of the 25 pairs.

All had malignancies of the tracheobronchial tree and underwent laser surgery to palliate breathlessness or haemoptysis. Partially obstructing and more proximal tumours proved more easily manageable. One quarter of the patients required repeat procedures and there were two deaths in the early post-operative period. The indications for such surgery, the technique and its limitations, and the palliation obtained are discussed.\r"

A comparison with normal subjects showed that lowered resting flow in both hemispheres was a common finding in all patients. Interhemispheric asymmetry was present only in patients with occlusion and the precentral, posterior temporal, and occipital regions were the most seriously affected. The CO2 reactivity was substantially reduced in both hemispheres of all stenotic and occluded patients, but occluded patients showed an increased reduction of CO2 reactivity only in the ipsilateral hemisphere. In addition to an hypothetical age effect, the atherosclerotic involvement of the cerebral vascular system leads to a reduction of flow and loss of CO2 reactivity in both hemispheres. In this context, the collateral supply capacity is not overloaded in case of a unilateral severe stenosis but fails in case of a unilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery. A suitable estimate of the blood flow reduction as a result of occlusion is made by the hemispheric and regional laterality indices applied in resting and hypercapnia conditions. These indices could be used as indicators for endarterectomy or bypass surgery as well as a sensitive means for appreciating cerebral blood flow response to treatment.\r"

Based on experiments in a specially developed dynamic phantom and on studies in primates in vivo, we have analyzed the validity of this method for measurements of both regional and total blood flow in the brain. We have also examined the errors introduced into flow computations as a function of changes in such parameters as: rate of xenon input, size of region of interest, magnitude of regional flow rates, and inter-regional flow differences. Our findings indicate a reasonable degree of accuracy for flow measurements in gray matter regions that are 3 cm in diameter or larger, while white matter blood flow is generally overestimated. The accuracy for regional flow assessments degrades as a function of: diminishing region size, increasing inter-regional flow differences, and flow rates in excess of 100 ml/100 g/min. Measurements for brain regions 2 cm or smaller in diameter can be in error by 25-50% as a result of partial volume averaging. Although the technique is not ideal for accurate flow measurements in small regions of the brain, it nevertheless provides a convenient means of assessing perfusion in major vascular territories of the brain in routine clinical applications.\r"

The in vivo radiotoxicity of [111In] oxine is far greater than the chemotoxicity of oxine. Of these radiolabeled compounds, [111In] oxine is the most effective in reducing the sperm-head population, the mean lethal dose (D37) to the organ being about 0.16 Gy at 37% survival of the sperm heads. The corresponding values of D37 for [111In]citrate, [114mIn]citrate and x-rays are approximately 0.34, 0.57, and 0.67 Gy, respectively. The present results affirm our earlier finding of the inadequacy of conventional dosimetry in estimating the biologic consequences of Auger-electron emitters in vivo. The very different radiotoxicities of [111In]oxine and [111In]citrate draw attention to the role of the chemical nature of the radiolabeled compounds in the expression of biologic effects in vivo, an aspect that is not considered explicitly in the formulation of conventional dosimetry.\r"

The structural study reveals an asymmetric pseudo-octahedral N3O3 metal coordination sphere with meridional stereochemistry. This asymmetry is not detected in solution by proton NMR spectroscopy at room temperature; however, at -90 degrees C spectroscopic changes suggest slowing of a fluxional process. The molecule unexpectedly crystallized with a molecule of ethanol hydrogen-bonded to an oxygen atom of one of the oxine ligands, suggesting that hydrogen-bonding will play a role in the solvation of this complex in protic solvents.\r"

However, only those patients with testicular enlargement had striking elevations of serum prolactin and gonadotropin values. The response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone in our patients was blunted, in contradistinction to that of children with true precocious puberty. In spite of the elevated levels of luteinizing hormone, the serum testosterone levels were in the prepubertal range, explaining the lack of peripheral manifestations of androgenic effect. Improvement of testosterone secretion followed decreasing prolactin levels with bromocriptine administration, suggesting an inhibitory effect of prolactin on luteinizing hormone action at the Leydig cell. We conclude that testicular enlargement is the result of continuous follicle-stimulating hormone stimulation and that the term \"true precocious puberty\" is not appropriate in children with hypothyroidism and macroorchidism unless the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis is shown to be at the pubertal stage.\r"

Thirty-six crying episodes were observed, 20 in healthy infants and 16 in infants with respiratory problems. Throughout all crying episodes cerebral blood volume and oxidized cytochrome aa3 demonstrated oscillatory fluctuations every 10 to 20 seconds, with maximum changes during prolonged exhalations. In 86% of episodes baseline blood volume rose and remained elevated during the cry. The relative content of deoxyhemoglobin in cerebral blood also rose, indicating that venous blood is the major contributor to the increase in blood volume. Changes in baseline cytochrome aa3 oxidation varied with the presence of lung disease and with the chronologic age of the infant. Cytochrome reduction with crying occurred significantly more often in infants with respiratory problems than in healthy infants. Cytochrome aa3 became more oxidized in 82% of crying episodes in healthy infants older than 3 days of age, but no change in cytochrome oxidation was usually noted in those younger than 3 days. Thus crying alters cerebral blood volume in all neonates in a pattern consistent with cyclic obstruction to cerebral venous return; it decreases cerebral oxygenation in infants with respiratory problems.\r"

Chronic (4-6 days) dosing of mice or rats with high doses of U74006F (30-200 mg/kg/day) has indicated that the compound is devoid of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity. Although the compound is not a glucocorticoid antagonist, it markedly stimulated secretion of adrenocorticotropin by the murine pituitary tumor (AtT-20) cell. The enhanced secretion of adrenocorticotropin was not associated with an increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine or [14C]leucine into DNA or protein, respectively. Although not a glucocorticoid, U74006F also blocked the release of [14C]arachidonic acid from AtT-20 cells damaged by either Fe++ or the metabolic poison, iodoacetate.

The relative percentage of dopamine to norepinephrine in noradrenergically innervated tissues (e.g., spleen) is known to be relatively constant within a species, and an increased percentage in any given tissue supports the premise that dopaminergic cells are present. We measured levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) from segments of the gastrointestinal tract of mice after injection of: 1) saline (control); 2) 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA); or 3) 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. In control tissues the ratio of dopamine/norepinephrine was higher (P less than .001) than in the spleen; DOPAC was present and the DOPAC/dopamine ratios were similar to those in the central nervous system (where dopaminergic neurons are present). Dopamine and norepinephrine were decreased by 6-OHDA in most myenteric plexus/smooth muscle tissues compared with controls and DOPAC was unmeasurable in most samples after 6-OHDA. In contrast, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine decreased norepinephrine but not dopamine in the smooth muscle/myenteric plexus. High dopamine/norepinephrine percentages, 6-OHDA depletion of dopamine and presence of DOPAC together suggest the presence of dopamine-containing neurons in the myenteric plexus of the gastrointestinal tract of mice.\r"

  ".W": "Lesch-Nyhan syndrome involves disorders of both purine and dopamine metabolism. Neonatal lesioning of dopaminergic neurons with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) has been proposed as a rodent model of the dopamine deficiency in this childhood disorder. In the present studies, the functional interaction between purines and dopamine was examined in adult rats which received 6-OHDA lesions either as neonates or as adults. Even though dopamine levels were decreased by at least 92%, both neonatal- and adult-6-OHDA-lesioned rats had normal hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase function and purine nucleotide levels (adenosine, ADP, ATP and AMP), indicating that hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase is not localized only to dopaminergic neurons in striatum. However, the 6-OHDA-lesioned animals were supersensitive to the locomotor activating effects of the adenosine antagonist, theophylline, with the response being greater in adult-6-OHDA-lesioned rats. This effect was presynaptic to dopaminergic neurons as indicated by alpha-methyltyrosine blockade of the theophylline response and its reinstatement by L-dopa. The presynaptic nature of this action of theophylline was supported further by a lack of interaction between theophylline and the direct acting D1- and D2-dopamine agonists, SKF-38393 and LY-171555, respectively. After systemic administration of SKF-38393 or L-dopa, central microinjection of the adenosine agonists, 2-chloroadenosine or 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine, were effective in preventing self mutilation induced by these dopamine agonists in neonatally lesioned rats. Relative potencies of the adenosine agonists for A1 and A2-adenosine receptors suggested involvement of an A2-adenosine receptor in this action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A gradient of 50 mM Na+ (out greater than in) and preloading of vesicles with unlabeled PAH were utilized to promote the influx of [3H]PAH into the vesicles. At final concentrations of 1 microM, NE and EP each produced significant elevations in vesicle uptake of [3H]PAH. The enhancement of PAH transport by NE or EP was inhibited by either phentolamine (100 microM) or yohimbine (100 microM). Prazosin (100 microM) or atenolol (100 microM) were unable to inhibit the response to NE. Similarly, prazosin or propranolol (100 microM) were unable to inhibit the response to EP. Clonidine (1 microM) also produced a significant elevation of PAH uptake, an effect inhibited by both phentolamine and yohimbine. Basolateral Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase activity also was increased significantly by either NE or EP (1 microM). Both agonists produced significant elevations of PAH uptake into vesicles preloaded with ATP. However, in the absence of NE or EP, PAH uptake into ATP-loaded vesicles was not significantly greater than into control vesicles. It was concluded that NE and EP enhance Na+-coupled PAH transport and that this effect may be mediated by alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Activation of Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase is a possible mechanism whereby adrenergic agonists may exert effects on Na+-coupled transport across the basolateral membrane.\r"

In electrically paced left atrial muscle, 0.3 mM theophylline reduced both the maximum developed tension observed in the presence of increasing concentrations of strophanthidin and the dose of this steroid that first elicited extrasystoles. Similarly, 0.3 mM theophylline decreased the time to onset of arrhythmias produced by 5 microM digoxin and the fractional occupancy of specific binding sites on Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase by digoxin at the onset of these dysrhythmic events. A higher level of theophylline (6.5 mM) severely diminished or prevented the positive inotropic and arrhythmogenic actions of cardiotonic steroids while promoting the contracture elicited by these digitalis-like compounds. In spite of the severe contracture observed in the presence of 6.5 mM theophylline plus 5 microM digoxin, the digoxin fractional occupancy was significantly less than that observed at the onset of digoxin-induced extrasystoles and contracture in the absence of theophylline. In radiolabeled ligand binding experiments, 6.5 mM theophylline reduced the affinity of specific binding sites for ouabain while having no effect on receptor density. These results, when considered in light of previous reports by other investigators, suggest that moderate concentrations of methylxanthines promote cardiotonic steroid-induced arrhythmias by increasing Ca++ influx and its uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Higher levels seem to antagonize the arrhythmogenic actions by inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticular Ca++ uptake and by antagonism of receptor binding.\r"

We have prepared 1-month release injectable microcapsules of leuprolide acetate using a biodegradable polymer, poly (dl-lactide-co-glycolide), to treat an endocrine-dependent tumor, prostate cancer. In the present study, the possibility using the microcapsules to treat endometriosis was investigated. In rats, the microcapsules exhibited a pseudo-zero order release from the injection site for 1 month after being administered s.c. and i.m., and maintained effective constant serum levels of the analog during the 4-week treatment. A single injection of the microcapsules (100 micrograms/kg/day as leuprolide acetate) suppressed luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol for more than 4 weeks, and caused a dramatic regression of growth of Jones experimental endometriosis model in female rats. These results encourage the belief that a 1-month release parenteral preparation of leuprolide acetate may be potentially useful in the therapy of endometriosis in human beings.\r"

  ".U": "88155405\r", 
  ".W": "When RAW264.7 murine macrophages were incubated with cholera toxin or pertussis toxin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis was enhanced markedly. Cholera toxin and pertussis toxin added together synergistically stimulated PGE2 synthesis. Cholera toxin and pertussis toxin also stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation. However, PGE2 synthesis was independent of increases in cAMP, as neither forskolin nor isoproterenol, which increased cAMP accumulation, nor dibutyryl-cAMP had any effect on PGE2 synthesis. In intact cells, cholera toxin and pertussis toxin stimulated phospholipase A2 to enhance metabolism of phosphatidylinositol to lysophosphatidylinositol and glycerophosphoinositol, with time courses similar to their stimulation of PGE2 synthesis. Cholera toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of proteins of Mr 45,000 and 49,000 in intact cells, whereas an additional substrate of Mr 41,000 was observed in vitro. Preincubation of intact cells with pertussis toxin blocked subsequent in vitro labeling of the Mr 41,000 protein by cholera toxin, suggesting that the same protein was ADP-ribosylated by both toxins. Western blot analysis using specific antisera against Gi, Go and Gs revealed that the Mr 41,000 substrate was bound by the anti-Gi and anti-Go but not anti-Gs. The present data suggest that guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins are involved in the regulation of arachidonic acid metabolism to PGE2 in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the possibility is raised that phospholipase A2 is regulated by both stimulatory and inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of benzodiazepines (BDZs) and beta carbolines (beta CCs) on sustained repetitive firing at high frequency (SRF) of action potentials of mouse spinal cord neurons in cell culture were examined using intracellular recording techniques. In control medium neurons responded to depolarizing current pulses with SRF. Limitation of SRF was produced by the anticonvulsant BDZs (diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam and lorazepam) at low to mid nanomolar concentrations, by a convulsant BDZ which does not bind to high affinity BDZ receptors (Ro 5-4864) at high nanomolar concentrations and by a BDZ receptor weak partial agonist (Ro 15-1788) at micromolar concentrations. The limitation of SRF was accompanied by use- and voltage-dependent reduction of maximal rate of rise (Vmax) of sodium-dependent action potentials. Partial agonist and inverse agonist beta CCs did not limit SRF at concentrations up to 200 nM. The limitation of SRF by diazepam was not prevented by inverse or partial agonists at the BDZ receptor, including Ro 15-1788 and the beta CCs. These findings suggest that limitation of SRF was produced by binding of BDZs, but not beta CCs, to voltage-dependent sodium channels and not to high affinity central BDZ receptors, and that BDZs limit SRF by slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation. We propose that the limitation of SRF may contribute to the efficacy of BDZs against generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus.\r"

When leukemia cells were reisolated from experimental animals, it was found that levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (IL-2R) expression were greater on cells isolated from the lymph node than on cells isolated from the spleen. Cloned sublines of FDC-P1-IL3 were selected by flow microfluorometry for high or low levels of IL-2R expression. Those clones that expressed high levels of IL-2R grew preferentially in the lymph node. Although IL-2 is not mitogenic for FDC-P1 cells and does not increase the rate of growth of FDC-P1-IL3 cells in vitro, the cloning efficiency of FDC-P1-IL3 is increased fourfold in the presence of IL-2. These observations suggest that the IL-2R on FDC-P1-IL3 cells plays an important role in modulating the growth of this leukemia in sites that contain high levels of IL-2.\r"

  ".W": "IL2 secretion in response to the T-cell mitogen Staphylococcal protein A (SPA) is significantly decreased in patients with major burns (n = 10, greater than 20% total body surface area) up to 50 days postburn in comparison with normal control (greater than 2 to 10 U/ml and 16 to 36 U/ml, respectively). Activation of protein kinase C (PK-C) and changes in [Ca++]i are both normally implicated in the production of IL2. Bypassing the requirements for mitogen-induced increases in [Ca++]i, using the cation ionophore A23187, or activating PK-C with the phorbol ester 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), failed to significantly restore SPA-induced IL2 production in cell cultures from burned patients. The combination of A23187 and TPA significantly (p less than 0.005-0.001) enhanced IL2 secretion in patients' cell cultures (range, 20 to greater than 64 U/ml). However, the levels of IL2 from the burned patients' cultures remained significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than those in control cultures exposed to TPA and A23187 (range, 256 to greater than 600 U/ml). Therefore, the burn-related defect in mitogen-induced IL2 secretion is only partially bypassed with cation ionophores and phorbol esters. This suggests that the abnormality in IL2 production may not be solely related to changes in PK-C activation and in [Ca++]i but may reside in other than transmembrane signalling mechanisms required for IL2 production.\r"

Gastrostomy feedings delivered 175 kcal/kg.day. The rates of heat production and heat loss did not differ significantly between any of the burn groups, whether fed ad libitum, or early or late by way of gastrostomy. The burned rats fed ad libitum gained significantly more weight than the rats fed late by gastrostomy. Contrary to previous studies using a guinea pig model, method and timing of feeding had no demonstrable effect on the postburn increment in heat loss and the secondary increment in heat production following thermal injury in rats.\r"

Expected basal energy expenditure (EBEE) calculated by the Harris-Benedict formula, initial and twice weekly measurements of energy expenditure (MEE) by indirect calorimetry, and simultaneous estimation of nutrient intake were obtained. In the whole cohort the EBEE was 1,715 +/- 24 kcal/day and the MEE was 2,218 +/- 59 kcal/day. The degree of hypermetabolism was 29.0 +/- 2.8%. A subgroup of 16 patients had metabolic rates measured in both the fed and unfed states. The degree of hypermetabolism was only 6.5 +/- 4.5% in the unfed, but increased to 34.1 +/- 3.2% when the same patients were fed (p less than 0.001). The factors affecting MEE were then evaluated by stepwise multiple regression analysis which showed that MEE = -4343 + (10.5 X %TBSA) + (0.23 X Caloric intake [CI]) + (0.84 X EBEE) + (114 X Temp [C]) - (4.5 X Postburn days), r = 0.82, p less than .001. We conclude that 25% of the CI is used to increase the MEE, which suggests that these measurements done in the fasting state cannot be used to predict requirements.\r"

  ".W": "Other than review of clinical experience, no assay exists that can reliably predict the long-term potential for aneurysm formation in an arterial prosthesis of biologic origin. Since mural degeneration probably results from proteolytic digestion, an in vitro assay was devised that used graft perfusion with 1% collagenase to induce rapid changes in mechanical properties. The effect of enzyme on graft diameter, compliance, permeability, and burst pressure was measured in ficin-digested, adipoyl chloride and glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine carotid artery and glutaraldehyde-tanned human umbilical vein. Both grafts have recently been reported to have a significant incidence of aneurysm within several years of implantation. Compliance and diameter were also measured noninvasively in patients with bovine carotid artery and human umbilical vein for more than 40 weeks after implantation. In vitro, the response to enzyme could be categorized into three groups. In group III, a diameter increase of more than 14% was associated with a significantly decreased compliance, and this paralleled the results found in aneurysmal grafts in vivo. In both grafts there was a strong correlation between postenzyme compliance change and initial compliance, loss of compliance being significantly greater in grafts with group III responses (p less than 0.01). This response may be a good predictor of a graft's overall susceptibility to aneurysmal degeneration, and initial compliance measurement may effectively identify inadequate fixation. Thus measurement of compliance may prove useful in quality control of a fixation process used in mass production. In conclusion, measurement of mechanical properties of biologic vascular grafts before and after collagenase exposure forms the basis for an effective in vitro assay of aneurysm susceptibility.\r"

No bacteria, fungi, or viruses were isolated from cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid of the four patients. All four had acute allograft rejection treated with OKT3 and developed signs and/or symptoms of meningitis within 72 hours of receiving the drug. To identify potential risk factors, the four patients with aseptic meningitis were compared with 12 patients on the renal transplant service in July 1986 who did not have signs or symptoms of meningitis. The development of aseptic meningitis was strongly associated with administration of OKT3. Because of this association, prospective surveillance of meningitis in patients receiving OKT3 was instituted. From November 1986 to May 1987, three (14%) of 21 patients treated with OKT3 developed aseptic meningitis. The clinical course of aseptic meningitis associated with OKT3 appears to be benign and self-limited. Nonetheless, this observation warrants continued surveillance of OKT3 therapy.\r"

Diagnosis is largely based on the epidemiological findings of faecal contamination of drinking water and serological exclusion of hepatitis A and B virus infection. Histological features of liver biopsy specimens are characteristic and virus-like particles in the stool are aggregated by antibody present in acute and convalescent phase sera of the test subject. NANB is widespread in India and several countries of South-East Asia; it is increasingly recognised in Africa and may occur in Latin America. Control measures include provision of clean water supplies, safe disposal of human excreta, and sound personal and food hygiene practices. Passive immunisation with immunoglobulin derived from healthy donors resident in the countries affected by the disease may protect vulnerable groups.\r"

ANP-like immunoreactivity is also present in the brain, suggesting that the peptide functions as a neuropeptide. We report here identification in porcine brain of a novel peptide of 26 amino-acid residues, eliciting a pharmacological spectrum very similar to that of ANP, such as natriuretic-diuretic, hypotensive and chick rectum relaxant activities. The complete amino-acid sequence determined for the peptide is remarkably similar to but definitely distinct from the known sequence of ANP, indicating that the genes for the two are distinct. Thus, we have designated the peptide 'brain natriuretic peptide' (BNP). The occurrence of BNP with ANP in mammalian brain suggests the possibility that the physiological functions so far thought to be mediated by ANP may be regulated through a dual mechanism involving both ANP and BNP.\r"

  ".W": "The best-characterized DNA-binding protein structure is the evolutionarily-conserved helix-turn-helix motif. Recently a second motif for DNA-binding proteins, the 'zinc finger', emerged from sequence analysis of TFIIIA, a factor involved in the control of transcription of the Xenopus 5S RNA gene. The finger structure is based on pairs of Cys and His residues which are arranged around a tetrahedrally-coordinated zinc ion. This centre allows the folding of tandemly repeated 'finger loops' which are thought to specify the contact with target DNA. Zinc fingers have been observed in the DNA-binding protein domains of transcriptional activators in yeast and man (R. Tijan, personal communication) and in several regulatory proteins of Drosophila including proteins encoded by members of the gap class of segmentation genes. One of these, Kruppel (Kr), acts at the first level of the segmentation gene hierarchy, and its protein product may bind to DNA. In addition, Kr is required for the development of the malpighian tubules, a posterior internal tissue that forms during later stages of embryogenesis. Here we show that a mutation which results in a conservative amino-acid exchange eliminates Kr+ function. The change occurs in a key position within the putative core structure of a finger, and supports the role of Cys in metal binding as proposed by Klug and coworkers.\r"

  ".W": "L1 sequences are a human-specific family of long, interspersed, repetitive elements, present as approximately 10(5) copies dispersed throughout the genome. The full-length L1 sequence is 6.1 kilobases, but the majority of L1 elements are truncated at the 5' end, resulting in a fivefold higher copy number of 3' sequences. The nucleotide sequence of L1 elements includes an A-rich 3' end and two long open reading frames (orf-1 and orf-2), the second of which encodes a potential polypeptide having sequence homology with the reverse transcriptases. This structure suggests that L1 elements represent a class of non-viral retrotransposons. A number of L1 complementary DNAs, including a nearly full-length element, have been isolated from an undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cell line. We now report insertions of L1 elements into exon 14 of the factor VIII gene in two of 240 unrelated patients with haemophilia A. Both of these insertions (3.8 and 2.3 kilobases respectively) contain 3' portions of the L1 sequence, including the poly (A) tract, and create target site duplications of at least 12 and 13 nucleotides of the factor VIII gene. In addition, their 3'-trailer sequences following orf-2 are nearly identical to the consensus sequence of L1 cDNAs (ref. 6). These results indicate that certain L1 sequences in man can be dispersed, presumably by an RNA intermediate, and cause disease by insertional mutation.\r"

The intense selective pressures resulting from the continual exposure of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin have resulted in the emergence of resistant strains that produce altered forms of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) with decreased affinity for the antibiotic. A comparison of the sequences of the PBP-2 genes from penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains, suggests that penicillin-resistant forms of PBP 2 may have arisen both by amino-acid substitutions and insertions, and by the exchange of a region encoding part of the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase domain with the homologous region from a closely related species.\r"

Embedded in the 709-amino-acid polypeptide chain of SWI5 are three tandemly repeated zinc-finger motifs. Because the zinc fingers of TFIIIA are known to bind to DNA, it is probable that in the case of SWI5 these finger motifs also play an important, but not necessarily exclusive, role in the sequence-specific binding of the protein to DNA. To test this prediction we have expressed the 89-amino-acid sequence of the domain containing the three zinc fingers of SWI5 in Escherichia coli as a cleavable fusion protein, purified under denaturing conditions and folded in vitro. This experimental approach allows us to study directly both the metal requirement and DNA-binding properties of the isolated polypeptide. We find that zinc is required for specific DNA recognition and, most significantly, DNaseI protection studies show that the isolated three-fingered domain is sufficient for sequence-specific binding to DNA.\r"

Cases of early (20 to 34 years) and midlife (35 to 49 years) onset had respectively less severe striatal involvement, suggesting a slower degenerative progression. High correlations among the grade of neuropathologic involvement, cell counts of neurons, and a rating of physical disability suggest that each represents a common underlying degenerative process of the disease. The relationship between the age at onset and the extent of neuropathologic involvement suggests that a single mechanism may determine both onset and rate of degenerative disease progression.\r"

Bilaterally nephrectomized rats injected with VPA and an amino acid load also develop hyperammonemia, which overall approximates 75% of that achieved in non-nephrectomized animals. In non-nephrectomized animals injected with an amino acid load, valproic acid produces a marked reduction in baseline and activated hepatic mitochondrial carbamyl phosphate synthetase I activity.

During oral therapy, mobility varied unpredictably in relation to levodopa dosing, suggesting a clinically random pattern. During duodenal delivery, however, a predictable and dramatic pattern of recurrent end-of-dose deterioration was observed; each intraduodenal levodopa dose resulted in 60 to 90 minutes of benefit. Plasma dopa levels correlated closely with mobility ratings for both modes of administration. Our findings indicate that erratic gastric emptying of levodopa is responsible for apparently \"random\" oscillations in mobility in at least one patient with Parkinson's disease and probably in others.\r"

Failure of reinnervation was suggested by slower and incomplete recovery of the plantar foot compound muscle action potential amplitude and by a reduced mean diameter of plantar foot muscle fibers in ablated rats. These findings indicate that deprivation of alpha motor neurons from descending raphe-spinal input interferes with their ability to respond to muscle-derived signals for reinnervation.\r"

Pregnancies were diagnosed by measurement of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 15 days after embryo transfer. Of the 64 women who conceived, 47 delivered term infants, one patient delivered a stillborn at 22 weeks, 14 aborted in the first trimester, and two had pregnancies that implanted in the tube. Abortion rates were similar for women treated with human menopausal gonadotropin (24%; 12 of 54) and those who received clomiphene citrate (12.5%; one of eight). Two patients conceived after treatment with a combination of clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin, neither of whom aborted. In 54 patients treated with human menopausal gonadotropin, there were no significant differences in mean maternal age, number of years of infertility before the pregnancy, history of previous pregnancies, amount of human menopausal gonadotropin used to induce ovulation, serum estradiol levels on the day of hCG administration, mean number of follicles, and the mean number of transferred embryos between the group who delivered and the group who aborted. We conclude that none of these factors are associated with increased tendency for fetal loss in our in vitro fertilization program. Beta-hCG levels on day 15 after embryo transfer were significantly lower in the group who aborted than in the group who delivered, and may be predictive of implantation failure.\r"

Ovine FSH (2-20 micrograms/mL) significantly enhanced the DNA polymerase alpha activity in the follicles perfused for 180-300 minutes, whereas the DNA polymerase beta activity and DNA concentration showed no significant changes. It is concluded that FSH causes the induction of DNA polymerase alpha before DNA synthesis during follicle growth in immature rat ovaries.\r"

All fetuses with sonographic evidence of hydrops had a hematocrit of 15% or less, although three fetuses with hematocrits below 15% showed no signs of hydrops. In patients followed with serial sonography, hydramnios was noted as the earliest sonographic abnormality in six of nine pregnancies. All six fetuses were anemic (hematocrit 14-26%) and required transfusion. However, in three pregnancies where the fetus was anemic (hematocrit 22%), there was no hydramnios or other sonographic abnormality. Increased placental thickness was observed in association with fetal hydrops and a hematocrit below 15% in four cases, as well as in three other cases with fetal hematocrit between 16-29% but no fetal hydrops. Measurements of umbilical vein diameter provided no useful information because no increase was observed in these measurements, even in pregnancies with advanced fetal disease evidenced by hydrops.\r"

  ".W": "Prevalence figures from various settings reveal a confusing picture of the true nature of incontinence, a disorder that causes physical and psychological stress in affected adults and their caregivers. One message that is evident from the literature, however, is that once incontinence begins, it tends to persist. The prevalence data from the studies reviewed are indicative of this persistence. Incontinence is more common in women than in men. It appears to become more severe with advanced age and other infirmities, such as immobility. Incontinence has also been linked with an increased risk of death. The reality of the problem is not difficult to gauge from the existing data. Nurses must use this information with their knowledge of the aging process and of the disruption of incontinence to plan intervention strategies. Targeting of appropriate groups for health education, clinical assessment, and intervention is necessary to alleviate or at least modify incontinence. Health care providers often do not recognize disruptions in urinary function. Some, like social workers, have difficulty in explaining the causes for incontinence and in identifying the appropriate treatment. Often, containment or management practices are the only measures utilized. Reliable and standardized methods for verifying the frequency and severity of incontinence in incontinent community-dwelling elderly persons are being tested. Methods of recording the pattern and amount of incontinence are also being tested. Nurses and ancillary staff within health care institutions are often left to manage incontinence without the aid of input from other disciplines, especially physicians. In the community, older adults may go to elaborate lengths to hide or disguise their incontinence. Knox reported that women are tolerant of incontinence. This statement is supported by the evidence that incontinent adults often do not utilize existing services. The energy expended in such futile attempts to deny or hide incontinence would be better spent in seeking care from knowledgeable and sensitive health professionals.\r"

Previous studies showed that okadaic acid is a skin irritant and induces ornithine decarboxylase (OrnDCase; 3-hydroxyl-L-glutamate 1-carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17) in mouse skin 4 hr after its application to the skin. This induction was strongly inhibited by pretreatment of the skin with 13-cis-retinoic acid. A two-stage carcinogenesis experiment in mouse skin initiated by a single application of 100 micrograms of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and followed by application of 10 micrograms of okadaic acid twice a week revealed that okadaic acid is a potent additional tumor promoter: tumors developed in 93% of the mice treated with DMBA and okadaic acid by week 16. In contrast, tumors were found in only one mouse each in the groups treated with DMBA alone or okadaic acid alone. An average of 2.6 tumors per mouse was found in week 30 in the group treated with DMBA and okadaic acid. Unlike phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate (TPA), teleocidin, and aplysiatoxin, okadaic acid did not inhibit the specific binding of [3H]TPA to a mouse skin particulate fraction when added up to 100 microM or activate calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) in vitro when added up to 1.2 microM. Therefore, the actions of okadaic acid and phorbol ester may be mediated in different ways. These results show that okadaic acid is a non-TPA-type tumor promoter in mouse skin carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Induction of the Escherichia coli SOS system increases the ability of the cell to perform DNA repair and mutagenesis. Products of the recA and umuD,C genes are required for mutagenesis induced by radiation and many chemicals. Transcription of the SOS genes including recA and umuD,C is repressed by a repressor, LexA protein, and is derepressed by the proteolytic cleavage of LexA facilitated by RecA protein that had been activated by inducing signals produced in the cell by agents that damage DNA. An activated form of RecA protein, RecA, seems to have roles in SOS mutagenesis other than its known role as an antirepressor. Derepression of the genes involved in SOS mutagenesis such as recA and umuD,C in defective chromosomal lexA(Def) mutants does not increase the ability of the cell to perform mutagenesis. Activation of RecA protein is essential to this ability. RecA facilitates the proteolytic cleavage of several repressors such as lambda, P22, and 434 phage repressors and LexA, and UmuD protein contains a sequence homologous to the regions surrounding the cleavage sites of these repressors; therefore, we examined the possibility that UmuD protein is cleaved by RecA. We found evidence that the intact UmuD protein was cleaved after mutagenic treatment and that the cleavage was dependent on RecA. The results suggested that UmuD protein may be proteolytically processed by RecA, and that processed UmuD may be the active form of the protein participating in mutagenesis.\r"

  ".U": "88158090\r", 
  ".W": "Interferon gamma induces striking phenotypic alterations in confluent cultures of human vascular endothelial cells (HEC), including cell shape change from polygonal to elongated and cytoskeletal actin rearrangement from dense peripheral bands to longitudinal bundles of stress fibers. Since many transmembrane proteins, including class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, interact with cytoskeletal actin, an interferon-gamma-induced anisotropic arrangement of stress fibers might cause anisotropic lateral diffusion of HEC class I MHC proteins. To test this hypothesis, we adapted the fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique to allow measurement of anisotropic diffusion of fluorescently labeled molecules on two-dimensional surfaces. A highly eccentric elliptical Gaussian laser beam was used to photobleach the sample and to monitor fluorescence recovery. In this technique, named \"line fluorescence photobleaching recovery,\" lateral diffusion is measured along that axis of the sample that is perpendicular to the major axis of the elliptical beam. The lateral diffusion coefficient and fractional mobility are obtained by fitting the experimental data to a theoretical recovery curve, the form of which is determined by the solution to a modified version of the diffusion equation in which a tensor is used to describe diffusion in two orthogonal directions. Fluorescein-conjugated murine monoclonal antibodies were used to label class I MHC proteins on interferon-gamma-treated HEC and human dermal fibroblasts. These two cultured human cell types were found to be similar in their elongated shape and anisotropic stress fiber organization. Class I MHC protein lateral mobility was compared to that of fluorescein-labeled phosphatidyl-ethanolamine, a membrane phospholipid probe. Class I MHC proteins diffused anisotropically on human dermal fibroblasts, whereas fluorescein-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine diffused isotropically on this cell type. In contrast, both class I MHC proteins and fluorescein-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine diffused isotropically on interferon-gamma-treated HEC. These data suggest that neither elongated shape nor anisotropic stress fiber arrangement is sufficient to induce anisotropic diffusion of proteins on the HEC plasma membrane.\r"

  ".U": "88158109\r", 
  ".W": "Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increases the water permeability of the toad urinary bladder. The increase occurs in the apical plasma membrane of granular cells that line the urinary surface of the bladder and is produced by the insertion of water permeability units that have been identified by freeze-fracture electron microscopy as intramembrane particle aggregates. Under water-impermeable conditions, particle aggregates reside in intracellular vesicles called \"aggrephores.\" In response to ADH, the aggrephores fuse with the apical plasma membrane and render it water permeable. When ADH is removed, intramembrane particle aggregates and aggrephores are retrieved from the apical membrane, and it returns to a water-impermeable state. To identify proteins involved in the water permeability response, we used lactoperoxidase/glucose oxidase to 125I-label external apical membrane proteins to compare control and ADH-treated bladders. Several polypeptides were consistently labeled in ADH-treated bladders and not in paired controls. After demonstrating that lactoperoxidase behaves as a fluid-phase marker and is sequestered in aggrephore-like vesicles when ADH is withdrawn, we used the technique of Mellman et al. [Mellman, I.S., Steinman, R. M., Unkeless, J. C. & Cohn, Z. A. (1980) J. Cell Biol. 86, 712-722] to label proteins endocytosed when water permeability declines after ADH is withdrawn to test whether the membrane proteins labeled in ADH-treated bladders behaved like particle aggregates. The internalized membranes contained polypeptides of the same molecular weights (55,000, 17,000-14,000, and 7,000) as those labeled on the apical surface of ADH-treated but not control bladders. These polypeptides are evidently involved in the ADH-stimulated water permeability response and may be components of particle aggregates.\r"

Like humans with the same inherited enzyme defect, animals homozygous for the new null allele are runted and have renal tubular acidosis. However, the prominent osteopetrosis found in humans with CA II deficiency could not be detected even in very old homozygous null mice. A molecular analysis of the deficient mice shows that the mutant gene is not deleted and is transcribed. The CA II protein, which is normally expressed in most tissues, could not be detected by immunodiffusion analysis in any tissues of the CA II-deficient mice, suggesting a nonsense or a missense mutation at the Car-2 locus.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review was done of 34 extremities studied between 1981 and 1985 with technetium-99m pyrophosphate scanning; 22 were subsequently amputated. Results of detailed pathologic examination or immediate postoperative examination of the resected extremity were available in 16 cases. In these cases, scanning had allowed correct prediction of the level of amputation and of the specific areas of muscle infarction in 13 cases. In the one case in which amputation was performed for infection rather than muscle necrosis, the lack of necrosis was correctly predicted with the scan. The limited results of this study indicate that the Tc-99m pyrophosphate scan allows the location of necrotic muscle to be predicted accurately and may therefore be a useful adjunct in determining the best level for ultimate amputation. Special caution is required in those cases in which muscle necrosis is due to acute causes (e.g., traumatic thrombosis) rather than chronic vascular disease.\r"

In addition, we conducted a telephone survey of 42 persons who cared for the PEG tube. The most common indication was neurologic impairment of deglutition. Early and late complications occurred in 12% and 33% of cases, respectively, and were usually minor. Our 30-day survival was 74%. Most patients (77%) maintained their weight with standard tube feedings. Satisfaction with and acceptance of the PEG was almost universal. Patients should be carefully selected, with attention to long-range benefit.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the incidence of tuberculosis in lung cancer patients with known tuberculin status. All patients received chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy, corticosteroid therapy, or both, and none received isoniazid prophylaxis. Positive tuberculin reactivity was found in 89 of the 257 patients; among these 89, tuberculosis developed in one patient before and in one patient after chemotherapy. Among the other 168 patients, one case of tuberculosis developed after chemotherapy. For all lung cancer patients, the incidence of tuberculosis was higher than age-specific and race-specific rates in a control population. The risk of tuberculosis was judged to be significantly higher in patients with positive than with negative tuberculin reactivity; among tuberculin reactors, however, the risk of tuberculosis was estimated to be less than the potential risk of isoniazid hepatotoxicity reported in the literature for patients in a similar age group. The median survival for tuberculin-positive lung cancer patients was 9.6 months. Because of the limited survival in these patients, and because of the high risk of isoniazid hepatotoxicity for patients in this age group, we do not recommend isoniazid prophylaxis for tuberculin-positive patients receiving chemotherapy for lung cancer.\r"
