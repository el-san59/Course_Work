  ".W": "We studied the capacity of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from patients with malignant brain tumors to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) and to respond to IL-2. The role of IL-2 in the generation of T cells cytotoxic against tumor cells was also studied. PBLs from the patients with malignant brain tumors tended to produce a level of IL-2 lower than that in normal controls because of the decreased number of IL-2-producing T cells. Phytohemagglutinin activated PBLs from normal controls and the patients, however, responded equally well to IL-2. This indicates that the expression of IL-2 receptors is abundant in PBLs of these patients, although IL-2 production may be depressed. Furthermore, after incubation with IL-2, PBLs from the patients with malignant glioma exhibited higher natural killer activity and strong cytotoxicity against glioma cells. This increased cytotoxicity was evident by Day 3 of culture in IL-2 and remained effective for at least 2 days. These observations of antitumor cytotoxicity make IL-2 a likely candidate for use in adoptive immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of manipulations in the cerebellopontine (CP) angle on the cochlear nerve was studied in 12 rhesus monkeys to elucidate how surgical procedures in the CP angle may affect the peripheral auditory system. Brain stem auditory evoked potentials and compound action potentials from the cochlear nerve were recorded throughout the experiments and were studied to determine the level of injury to the cochlear nerve. After the manipulations, the animals were perfused with fixatives and their temporal bones were removed and examined histologically. The monkeys showed electrophysiological changes similar to those observed in humans as a result of surgical manipulations in the CP angle. Avulsions of the internal auditory artery and cochlear nerve fibers at the area cribrosa were the most common histological findings. The auditory evoked potentials were suddenly and irreversibly lost during the manipulations in 3 monkeys, and hemorrhagic foci were identified histologically in these animals at the fundus of the internal auditory canal (the area cribrosa). No morphological changes at locations other than the area cribrosa were identified in these 3 monkeys. The results of this study indicate that injury to the internal auditory artery at the area cribrosa may play an important role in the abrupt loss of hearing experienced by some patients while they are undergoing operations in the CP angle. This study also led to speculation regarding the possible existence of collateral circulation to the cochlea as a factor in injury to the internal auditory artery during acoustic neurinoma operations.\r"

The results showed a high degree of similarity in the sensory, affective and evaluative properties of the two types of pain. The main difference between the acute and chronic pains was one of overall intensity, with the acute pain generally being described as more intense. A comparison of the arthritic pain in hemophilia with the pain of other arthritic disorders revealed no major differences. Sources of inter-individual variability were also explored and the results showed that the pain scores in hemophiliac subjects were largely unrelated to demographic and pain history variables. However, significant differences were observed in the way French- and English-speaking subjects described and rated their pain. Irrespective of the origin of their pain, French-speaking subjects characteristically rated their pain as more intense and more affectively laden than the English group. These results demonstrate that ethnocultural factors associated with language affiliation may contribute to inter-individual variation in pain perception.\r"

S1 nuclease analyses using genomic and synthetic probes indicated that the 5' ends of RNA synthesized in vitro are similar to those of RNA made in vivo and contain 5' poly(A) sequences contiguous with the translation initiation codon. Kinetic analysis of RNA synthesized in vitro demonstrated that a correctly initiated and 5' polyadenylylated product appeared within 5 min after transcription reactions were started. A cis-splicing mechanism of poly(A) addition can be ruled out because the DNA template used in vitro had no poly(dT) sequence and could contain as few as 37 base pairs upstream of the start of the RNA. In addition, we found that a point mutation in the first of two consecutively encoded adenylate residues preceding the ATG initiation codon abolished transcription in vitro. These data are consistent with at least three models: (i) RNA polymerase initiates RNA synthesis with a run of adenylate residues; (ii) a poly(A) primer is used for initiation; or (iii) the poly(A) leader is rapidly and efficiently attached to the RNA by ligation.\r"

(1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 925-929]. It is shown here that PK-P is present in solubilized membranes of A-431 carcinoma cells where it changes the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase activity. Polylysine, a weak PK-P activator, inhibited the autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor both in the absence and presence of EGF. Increased PK-P activity induced by histone 1, a potent activator, gave rise to increased autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor as well as phosphorylation at tyrosine residues of numerous other endogenous membrane components. The stimulation by histone was particularly striking in the presence of EGF. A similar stimulation was achieved with polylysine and EGF on addition of yeast PK-P. However, addition of yeast PK-P in the presence of histone 1 markedly inhibited the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous membrane proteins. We conclude from these results that the effect of PK-P on the EGF receptor takes place in three phases: at low levels PK-P inhibits the autophosphorylation, at intermediate levels it stimulates the autophosphorylation as well as the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of numerous other membrane proteins, and at high levels it inhibits the phosphorylation of these proteins.\r"

We report here that IL-3 and IL-6 act synergistically in support of the proliferation of murine multipotential progenitors in culture. The time course of total colony formation by spleen cells isolated from mice 4 days after injection of 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg) was significantly shortened in cultures containing both lymphokines relative to cultures supported by either of the two factors. Serial observations (mapping) of individual blast cell colonies in culture revealed that blast cell colonies emerged after random time intervals in the presence of IL-3. The average time of appearance in IL-6 alone was somewhat delayed, and in cultures containing both factors the appearance of multilineage blast cell colonies was significantly hastened relative to cultures grown in the presence of the individual lymphokines. In cultures of day-2 post-5-fluorouracil bone marrow cells, IL-6 failed to support colony formation; IL-3 alone supported the formation of a few granulocyte/macrophage colonies, but the combination of factors acted synergistically to yield multilineage and a variety of other types of colonies. In this system, IL-1 alpha also acted synergistically with IL-3, but the effect was smaller, and no multilineage colonies were seen. Together these results indicate that IL-3 and IL-6 act synergistically to support the proliferation of hemopoietic progenitors and that at least part of the effect results from a decrease in the G0 period of the individual stem cells.\r"

The mouse CD3-gamma gene, consisting of seven exons, was found to be highly homologous to the CD3-delta gene described earlier. Both the high level of sequence homology and the exon/intron organization indicate that the CD3-gamma and -delta genes arose by gene duplication. Surprisingly, murine and human genomic DNA clones could be isolated that contained elements of both the CD3-gamma and CD3-delta genes. In fact, the putative transcription start site of the mouse CD3-gamma gene is less than 1.4 kilobases from the transcription initiation site of the mouse CD3-delta gene. Common elements that regulate the divergent transcription of the two genes are therefore proposed to be located in the intervening 1.4-kilobase DNA segment. This might contribute to the coordinate expression of the CD3-gamma and -delta genes during intrathymic maturation of T lymphocytes.\r"

To define the mechanisms of interaction of T4 with the surface of antigen-presenting cells as well as with human immunodeficiency virus, we have further analyzed the sequence, structure, and expression of the human and mouse T4 genes. T4 consists of an extracellular segment comprised of a leader sequence followed by four tandem variable-joining (VJ)-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic segment. The structural domains of the T4 protein deduced from amino acid sequence are precisely reflected in the intron-exon organization of the gene. Analysis of the expression of the T4 gene indicates that T4 RNA is expressed not only in T lymphocytes, but in B cells, macrophages, and granulocytes. T4 is also expressed in a developmentally regulated manner in specific regions of the brain. It is, therefore, possible that T4 plays a more general role in mediating cell recognition events that are not restricted to the cellular immune response.\r"

CD1a was originally named HTA1 or T6 and thought to be the human equivalent of mouse Tla. The genes coding for all three have now been identified by transfection into mouse cells. The transfectants express the surface antigens that can then be recognized by the corresponding cluster of monoclonal antibodies used to define the three members of CD1. The full sequence of the genomic DNA is described for all three. The intron-exon structure of CD1a is deduced by comparison with a near-full-length cDNA clone. Similar structures are proposed for the other two, largely based on sequence homology. An unusually long 5'-untranslated exon (280 bases long) is highly conserved between the three genes, suggesting an important but unknown function. CD1c has a duplicated form of this exon that is thought to be spliced out. The major homology between the three antigens is in the beta 2-microglobulin-binding domain. The general relatedness to major histocompatibility complex class I and class II molecules is significant but low, with no section of higher homology to mouse Tla.\r"

  ".U": "88097457\r", 
  ".W": "The CD4 molecule, expressed by T cells restricted by class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, is believed to play a role in T-cell activation. We have previously suggested that CD4 interacts with the T-cell receptor for antigen (TCR) and with class II MHC and that this dual interaction stabilizes the bond between the TCR and antigen in association with MHC. To investigate the contribution of CD4-TCR interaction, we have used the murine monoclonal anti-TCR V beta 8 antibody F23.1 to activate cloned T cells. Weak activation by soluble biotinylated F23.1 was markedly enhanced by crosslinking with either avidin or with anti-immunoglobulin (anti-Ig). The monoclonal anti-L3T4 antibody GK1.5, which normally inhibits the activation induced by F23.1, did not inhibit when GK1.5 and F23.1 were coaggregated on T cells by anti-Ig, and in many experiments activation was enhanced. Coaggregation of anti-Thy-1.2, anti-H-2Kk, or anti-LFA-1 with F23.1 also enhanced T-cell activation, although, unlike GK1.5, these antibodies in soluble form had no effect on the response to F23.1. These results are consistent with a model for T-cell activation that proposes a primary interaction between L3T4 and the TCR to stabilize TCR complexes and so to enhance T-cell activation. A related but less specific accessory role for other T-cell surface molecules is also suggested. We propose that the cellular interaction that leads to physiological T-cell activation not only achieves TCR ligation but also promotes through their ligation or redistribution the interaction of other T-cell surface molecules, all of which contribute to the overall strength of the activation signal.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic value of 73 bronchoalveolar lavages was assessed in 67 immunocompromised children (aged 3 months to 16 years) with pulmonary infiltrates. Thirty one children had primary and 19 secondary immune deficiency, 14 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and three AIDS related complex. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed during fibreoptic bronchoscopy, under local anaesthesia in all but two. One or more infective agents was found in eight of 11 patients with severe acute pneumonia and in 26 of 62 patients with interstitial pneumonitis. In interstitial pneumonitis, the most frequently encountered agents were Pneumocystis carinii (12), cytomegalovirus (8), and Aspergillus fumigatus (3). The yield was related to the severity of interstitial pneumonitis. The mean cellular count and cytological profile in lavage returns from patients with varying infective agents or underlying pathological conditions showed no significant difference, except in those children with AIDS and AIDS related complex who had appreciable lymphocytosis (mean percentage of lymphocytes 28 (SD 17]. In children with AIDS and chronic interstitial pneumonitis lymphocytosis without pneumocystis infection was observed in eight of nine bronchoalveolar lavage returns and was suggestive of pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage produced a specific diagnosis from the microbiological or cytological findings in 44 instances (60%). Transient exacerbation of tachypnoea was observed in the most severely ill children but there was no case of respiratory decompensation attributable to the bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a safe and rapid examination for the investigation of pulmonary infiltrates in immunocompromised children. It should be performed as a first line investigation and should reduce the use of open lung biopsy techniques.\r"

Consequently, we undertook this study to evaluate any impact on mortality of HLA B27 and associated rheumatic disorders.

  ".W": "To evaluate thallium scintigraphy in predicting coronary artery bypass graft patency, exercise thallium scintigraphy and selective graft and native vessel angiograms were performed in 22 asymptomatic and 29 symptomatic consecutive patients three months after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Twelve out of 22 asymptomatic patients (55%) had reversible thallium defects on postoperative images; in 10 patients the postoperative scans were normal. The graft patency was significantly lower in asymptomatic patients with abnormal thallium perfusion compared to those with normal perfusion after CABG (68% vs. 91%, p less than 0.05). The rate of graft patency in symptomatic patients was 66/87 (76%). Thallium scintigraphy was 77% sensitive and 78% specific in detecting one or more stenosed or occluded bypass grafts in patients without angina (accuracy 77%). When data from exercise electrocardiography were combined with scintigraphy, all but one patient with incomplete revascularization could be detected (positive predictive accuracy 92%). In symptomatic patients, thallium scintigraphy accurately predicted the presence or absence of graft occlusion in 24/29 (83%) cases. Thus, abnormal myocardial perfusion due to stenosis or occlusion of bypass grafts is common in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients after CABG. Thallium scintigraphy together with exercise electrocardiography appear to be useful non-invasive methods in detecting painless myocardial ischemia and in predicting bypass graft occlusion after CABG.\r"

Among women, smoking was also more common in the south-western area (24 vs. 16%) and serum cholesterol levels were higher in the eastern area (6.1 vs. 6.0 mmol/l) as well as blood pressure levels (142/84 vs. 138/81 mmHg). Among both genders, prevalence of hypertension and proportion of persons on antihypertensive drug therapy was higher in eastern Finland. The comparison of these findings with the results from previous studies carried out among men in these two areas indicates that the risk factor levels have been decreasing in both areas and that the previously observed differences in risk factor levels between eastern and south-western Finland (the levels used to be higher in the east) have levelled off. The favourable development in eastern Finland may be a result of the North Karelia Project.\r"

Basal adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels (9:00 AM) and responses to ovine CRH were unaffected by variations in E2 and progesterone during each phase of the menstrual cycle. In women undergoing ovariectomy who received E2 replacement therapy, basal concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol (9:00 AM) and the responses to human corticotrophin-releasing hormone were not altered by administration of E2 alone or E2 with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Under these experimental conditions, our findings suggest that physiologic changes in E2 and progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle and replacement doses of estrogen and progestin commonly used clinically do not significantly influence basal adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels or responsiveness to corticotrophin-releasing hormone.\r"

Consistent with previous observations that these two antigens are co-expressed on the vast majority of thymocytes, peripheral blood T cells and tonsillar T cells, all 28 reactive lymphoproliferations showed essentially identical patterns of CD3 and beta F1 expression. In contrast, only 29 of 55 T-lineage lymphomas displayed coexpression of these antigens. Among 33 peripheral T-cell lymphomas, 11 cases showed CD3/beta F1 discordance (7 CD3+/beta F1-; 4 CD3-/beta F1+), and 5 showed absence of both these antigens. Nine of 22 T-lymphoblastic lymphomas showed CD3/beta F1 discordance (all CD3+/beta F1-), and 1 case was CD3-/beta F1-. These patterns of CD3/beta F1 expression, along with the patterns of CD2, CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD8 antigen expression in these neoplasms, indicate that T-cell lymphomas can manifest phenotypes not apparently reflective of normal T populations and suggest the presence of abnormal gene expression in these malignancies. The existence of aberrant phenotypes in T-cell neoplasia suggests caution in interpretation of investigations using T-lineage malignancies as models of normal T-cell biology. Finally, the identification of phenotypic abnormalities in T-lineage populations can be of great diagnostic usefulness in the delineation of benign versus malignant T-cell proliferations.\r"

  ".U": "88103942\r", 
  ".W": "A Shwartzman-like reaction was elicited in rabbits by preparing the skin with intradermal injections of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1 alpha or beta). The animals were challenged intravenously with endotoxin or by intravascular activation of complement with immune complexes or zymosan 18 hours later and were sacrificed after another 2 hours. Animals challenged with saline did not develop Shwartzman-like reactions. The sites prepared with endotoxin or with either form of IL-1 plus TNF alpha developed visible hemorrhage, whereas sites injected with either IL-1 or TNF alpha alone did not. Hemorrhage and microthrombosis were quantitated with 59Fe-labeled erythrocytes and 111In-platelets for 2 hours after the intravenous challenge, and the findings confirmed the observations made on gross inspection. Dermal sites prepared with the cytokines and challenged intravenously with endotoxin, immune complexes, or zymosan exhibited some diffuse hemorrhage and an intense erythrocyte extravasation around distended vessels, along skin appendages, and the panniculus carnosus muscle. The lumens of many large and postcapillary venules contained aggregates of platelets and leukocytes. These changes were superimposed on those seen at prepared sites (leukocyte infiltration). By electron microscopy fibrin was demonstrable in association with the formed elements of the blood. Histologic examination of the 18-hour-old preparative lesions or 20-hour-old lesions of saline-\"challenged\" animals revealed accumulation of leukocytes in the dermis, predominantly neutrophils. This accumulation was sparse at sites treated with only IL-1 or TNF alpha, but very intense at sites treated with both IL-1 and TNF alpha or with endotoxin. These observations were confirmed quantitatively by measuring the accumulation of 51Cr-labeled neutrophils for 2 hours after injection. The potency of IL-1 alpha was comparable to that in our earlier report, and TNF alpha was about three log times less potent. Sites treated with both IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha resulted in 69% greater neutrophil emigration than the additive response elicited by each cytokine. The reported findings implicate a synergism between IL-1 and TNF alpha in the induction of both the inflammatory reaction (preceding the Shwartzman reaction) and the thrombohemorrhagic component of the Shwartzman reaction proper.\r"

In 55 cases of this series, the ER status was also determined by standard biochemical methods. Our study revealed an inverse correlation between GF and ER status. This negative relationship was most significant when both variables were determined immunohistologically in the same tissue block and less significant when GF was analyzed by immunohistology and ER status by biochemical methods. These data suggest that the immunohistologically assessed ER values characterize the receptor status of a given carcinoma better than the biochemical values, which leads to the conclusion that the immunohistologically determined close negative relationship between GF and ER reflects the actual in vivo situation of a given breast carcinoma case. However, the immunohistologic analysis also revealed that there is a proportion of exceptional cases, ie, those with a positive ER status and a large or moderately large GF. Because only half of the ER-positive breast carcinomas respond to endocrine therapy with objective remission., it is hypothesized that it might be preferentially these mentioned exceptional cases that fail to positively respond to endocrine treatment protocols.\r"

  ".W": "Growth factors secreted by platelets and macrophages may play roles in atherogenesis and in wound repair. The multiple biologic effects of these factors are being studied extensively in vitro, but their roles in vivo are relatively unexplored. The cellular responses to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were examined in a wound chamber model in rats. Growth factors were emulsified in bovine dermal collagen suspensions, placed in 1 X 30-mm porous polytetrafluoroethylene tubes, inserted subcutaneously, and removed after 10 days. The presence of PDGF (400 ng), TGF beta (200 ng), or bFGF (100 ng) increased the DNA content of the chambers two- to sixfold, compared with controls. Regardless of dose, EGF (100-800 ng) did not affect the DNA content. The increases in DNA observed for PDGF, TGF beta, or bFGF resulted from accumulations of varying numbers of fibroblasts, capillaries, macrophages, and leukocytes in 10-day chambers. The addition of 250 micrograms/ml heparin to the collagen suspension potentiated the response to PDGF and bFGF, but not to TGF beta or EGF. The clearance of 125I-labeled growth factors from the chambers was biphasic. After an initial rapid phase, the remaining growth factor was slowly cleared. The half-life of the initial phase was rapid for PDGF (12 hours) and bFGF (9 hours) and somewhat slower for TGF beta (22 hours). There was no difference in the rate of clearance between collagen and collagen/heparin matrices for any of the growth factors examined. These studies demonstrate that PDGF, bFGF, and TGF beta can induce granulation tissue development in normal animals. The similarity in cellular responses to three peptides with differing in vitro actions suggests that the responses observed at 10 days reflect a secondary process, possibly mediated by effector cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, or granulocytes that are attracted into the chamber by each growth factor, rather than a direct effect of the factors themselves.\r"

In the 8 ALS patients with upper motor neuron signs, the mean cortical rCMRGlc was significantly lower than in 11 age-matched control subjects (p less than 0.01). The degree of hypometabolism correlated with the duration of the clinical signs and extended throughout the cortex and basal ganglia, but not to the cerebellum. Of the 4 such patients who had repeat PET scans, 3 demonstrated significant subsequent reduction in the rCMRGlc, corresponding to the worsening of the clinical picture. In contrast, 4 ALS patients with disease confined to lower motor neurons and 3 patients with lower motor neuron disease from old paralytic poliomyelitis had normal or near-normal rCMRGlc throughout the brain. Because histological evidence shows no generalized neuronal cell loss in the cortex of ALS patients, including in some cases the primary motor regions, the demonstration of severe generalized hypometabolism in structurally normal cortex indicates that some cortical neurons exist in a state of neuronal nonfunction, rather than cell death, and that anatomoclinical correlations may be more complex. The data also indicate that ALS with upper motor neuron involvement extends beyond the corticospinal tracts and differs in cortical function from the ALS confined to lower motor neurons or the other lower motor neuron disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Somatosensory evoked responses after median nerve stimulation were recorded in 21 patients during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. During hypothermia a significant linear correlation (P less than 0.001) was found between evoked potential latency and temperature. Correlation was best for tympanic membrane temperature during cooling and for perfusate temperature (arterial, venous) during rewarming. The increase in latency was more pronounced for middle latency components (N2, N3) and for the early cortical N1 than for the cervical N0 and central conduction time. In all patients N1 was detectable at 26 degrees C, with slightly reduced amplitude. In the rewarming period the changes occurred in the reverse order and pre-bypass values were achieved at normothermia. The slopes of the regression lines were different during cooling and rewarming, when latencies were related to patient (tympanic, nasopharyngeal, rectal) temperature, but identical when arterial or venous blood temperature was used as the reference. No correlation was found between latency and perfusion pressure. We conclude that sophisticated temperature measurement is required to aid the interpretation of evoked responses used during hypothermia.\r"

The median immunoreactive CGRP (i-CGRP) level from 158 CSF specimens was 8.0 pmol/l, as measured with an antiserum recognizing the whole molecule of CGRP (CC-2/1) and 12.0 pmol/l with an antiserum recognizing the C-terminal region of CGRP (CG-39). CSF samples with high protein concentration (greater than or equal to 0.6 g/l) had a median level of i-CGRP of 18.4 pmol/l when measured with antiserum CC-2/1 and 23.0 pmol/l with CG-39, while samples with 'normal' protein concentrations (less than 0.6 g/l) had much lower values, with median levels of 7.0 and 11.0 pmol/l, with the two antisera, respectively. Gel-permeation chromatography and HPLC studies revealed multiple peaks of i-CGRP, consistent with forms with different molecular weights. However, on HPLC, the major peak of i-CGRP corresponded to the elution position of the synthetic hCGRP(1-37) and was able to bind to a CGRP specific receptor preparation suggesting that it may be biologically active.\r"

  ".W": "Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) technique was applied to the detection of alterations in renal inflammatory cell subsets in seven healthy control persons and 24 patients with membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). Eighteen of the patients had nephrotic syndrome, and the rest had either persistent proteinuria or remission of the disease. Only one patient showed impaired renal function. Compared with the controls, FNAB revealed a significantly (p less than 0.01) increased number of mononuclear inflammatory cells (MIC, the sum in increment percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes) in MGN. This was mainly due to relative lymphocytosis; the number of monocytes was high particularly in patients with daily urine protein excretion in excess of 5 g. The duration of the disease did not clearly correlate with the degree of lympho- or monocytosis. In nine patients the results of the renal needle biopsy and FNAB could be compared. Biopsy revealed signs of MIC infiltration in 5/9 patients and FNAB in 7/9 patients. T-lymphocyte subsets in FNAB and peripheral blood were analyzed using monoclonal antibodies and indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The OKT4/OKT8 ratio in FNAB was 0.96 +/- 0.07 (s.e.m.) in patients and 1.49 +/- 0.12 in controls (p less than 0.01). In peripheral blood these ratios were 0.8 +/- 0.07 and 1.43 +/- 0.13 (p less than 0.001), respectively. The alterations were due to a decreased number of OKT4 positive lymphocytes. These studies suggest an associated interstitial accumulation of MIC and an imbalance between T helper/inducer and T suppressor/cytotoxic cells in MGN.\r"

Sensitization through a single epidermal application of 1% MDI solution in ethyl acetate to the backs of the mice resulted in marked ear swelling. The time course of the swelling was characteristic of delayed-type hypersensitivity and the increment of the ear thickness was compatible with that induced by toluene diisocyanate (TDI). Passive transfer of the MDI-induced contact sensitivity was successfully achieved using lymphocytes from the lymph nodes of MDI-sensitized syngeneic mice, and the effector cells were found to be T cells. Cross reaction between MDI and TDI has shown that MDI is not only a potent contact sensitizer but also can form a contact sensitizer group together with TDI.\r"

We describe a new method, measuring visual flicker discrimination of the blue-sensitive mechanism of vision. This method is noninvasive, quantitative, and capable of distinguishing two types of impairment. Blue-flicker discrimination was measured in 10 adults with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes for less than 5 yr. Although no evidence of diabetic changes was detected by careful ophthalmic examination by an experienced ophthalmologist, 12 of 19 eyes (63%) had flicker discrimination scores considered abnormal in comparison with those of a control group, and 8 of 10 subjects (80%) had at least 1 eye with abnormal performance. In all but 2 abnormal eyes the deficit of blue-flicker discrimination was of the \"absorptive\" type, suggesting increased absorbance or scattering of blue light in the optical media. These data show that a functional impairment of vision can be measured very early in the course of type I diabetes, before visible retinopathy is present, and suggest this test procedure may have both investigative and clinical applications.\r"

A comparison of some aspects of LAK cell precursors and LAK cell function was undertaken in 44 control subjects and 44 preoperative patients suffering from gastrointestinal cancer (20 localised and 24 advanced). Lymphokine activated killer cell precursor (natural killer (NK) cell) activity was significantly diminished in patients with advanced tumours (p less than 0.02) as was fully mature LAK cell activity against an NK resistant target cell (p less than 0.012). T-lymphocyte responses were not significantly different between the three groups. The reduced LAK cell generation was associated with a significantly diminished proliferative response of LAK precursors to stimulation with high dose IL-2 in vitro (p less than 0.012). Impaired LAK cell generation may explain the failure of adoptive cellular immunotherapy with LAK cells in some patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer and prompts the search for means of augmenting this activity in such patients.\r"

The number of CD4 positive (helper/inducer) cells and natural killer cell activity increased after therapy (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01).

It is unknown whether detection of these antibodies adds information to the detection of rheumatoid factor (RF). In a group of 132 patients with RA, 94 were RF positive. Of the 38 patients persistently negative for RF, 14 (37%) were positive for APF. These 14 proved to have a disease course similar to that of RF positive patients. This similarity was shown most impressively by radiological progression of the disease, and to a lesser extent, by the medication needed to control the disease and the number of extraarticular manifestations. No significant correlation was shown between APF and antinuclear antibodies. Among the RF positive patients with their generally poorer prognosis, APF identified the worst affected. Our study suggests that APF in serum of patients with RA is associated with a poor disease outcome, especially in RF negative patients.\r"

Binding of the lectin peanut agglutinin (PA) was significantly reduced in PSS monocytes (p less than 0.001) together with a reduction in the density of nonspecific esterase staining (p less than 0.001) suggesting advanced maturation. Using monoclonal antibodies to identify cell surface markers, we demonstrated a significant reduction in PSS monocytes bearing the Leu M2 antigen (Mac 120, antigen presenting cells) over controls (p less than 0.05), but were unable to show any differences in the monocyte subpopulations using antisera against Leu M3 and HLA-DR surface antigens. The ectoenzymes 5'-nucleotidase (5'N) and alkaline phosphodiesterase 1 (APD1) were lower and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) levels were higher in patients with PSS, compatible with immune activation. Interferon-gamma levels in serum did not appear to account for these changes, whereas the levels of Clq binding complexes correlated inversely with the levels of LAP (p less than 0.05). There was a strong correlation between the number of Leu M3 positive cells and the level of the ectoenzyme LAP (p less than 0.001). With increasing disease duration, higher levels of Clq binding complexes were detected (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that monocytes in PSS differ from those in normals and appear to have undergone advanced differentiation and activation changes.\r"

Transcutaneous muscle stimulation (TMS) may reverse muscle atrophy and lean mass loss in immobile patients by \"artificial exercise.\" Four paraplegic patients with upper motor neuron lesions entered The Ohio State University Clinical Research Center for a 21-day metabolic balance study. After 6 days of baseline monitoring, each underwent isometric tetanic contractions (15 sec on; 45 sec off) of all major lower extremity muscle groups with TMS for 10 hr daily. Cross-sectional areas of muscle plus bone were calculated with CAT scan planimetry at 7 levels in both lower extremities before and after the TMS period. Three patients completed the metabolic balance study. TMS produced significant growth of innervated thigh and calf muscles in all paraplegic patients. Little growth occurred where bone and tendon predominate. No significant changes in nitrogen balance (urine and stool excretion), potassium balance (urine excretion only), or phosphate balance (urine excretion only) could be demonstrated. Two possible explanations are (1) that the patients may have been underfed and (2) that perhaps due to an increase in metabolic rate owing to the stimulation, lean tissue in other locations may have been mobilized to meet leg muscle demands. Future studies will incorporate metabolic monitoring of oxygen consumption and CO2 production during the experiment.\r"

Artificial nutrition was the same for each patient during the 9-day study period. Two periods of 4 days were defined and randomized for each patient, separated by one day. During the muscular stimulation (MS) period, intermittent electrical stimulation of the muscles of the legs (external electrodes), were performed daily during 2 X 30 mn. During the other period, muscular stimulations were not performed. Urinary excretion of nitrogen (micro-Kjeldhal digestion and Nessler procedure), creatinine (Jaffe reaction), and 3-methyl histidine (3-MH) (gas phase chromatography) was measured every day. (table; see text) We conclude that a significant decrease in 3-MH and creatinine excretion is observed during the MS period. In intensive care unit patients, muscle protein breakdown may be influenced by intermittent muscular electrical stimulation.\r"

There were glomerular, periglomerular, crescentic, and interstitial T and T-cell subsets. Few interstitial and no glomerular B and NK cells were observed. TH cells were much more common than TS. Phenotypes were quantitatively evaluated in 221 nephritic and 32 control glomeruli. T and/or TH cells were positively correlated with M phi, r = 0.30 to 0.74, P less than 0.05 to 0.0005. Although differences in phenotypes were observed, these differences were insufficient to distinguish between subtypes. Analysis of R and NR revealed no relationship to percent crescents, entry serum creatinine, oliguria, or need for dialysis. NR was related to presence of anti-GBM disease, P = 0.001, as was ability to stop dialysis, 0 of 7 GBM versus 9 of 10 other, P less than 0.001. Mild infiltrates of lymphocytes and M phi correlated with R, P less than or equal to 0.02. R had fewer numbers of TH and M phi in glomeruli, P = 0.0001, in crescents, P less than 0.02, and total TH and M phi compared to NR, P less than 0.001. Crescentic and total TH/S ratios were lower in NR than R, P less than 0.05. These findings demonstrate that components of the cell-mediated immune (CMI) system are present by MAb analysis, that subtypes cannot be differentiated by CMI constitution, and R to PM is related to intensity and composition of CMI involvement. Independence of the CMI system relative to anti-GBM disease remains to be clarified.\r"

The authors suggest that visual loss after hypotension is of three types. Profound hypotension in patients with neither anemia nor arteriosclerosis generally causes water-shed infarctions in the parietal and occipital lobes. Brief hypotension combined with arteriosclerosis favors juxtalaminar optic nerve infarction indistinguishable from spontaneous anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In anemic patients without arteriosclerotic risk factors, hypotension is likely to cause infarction in the orbital optic nerve, where pial end vessels are subject to compression from hypoxic edema.\r"

Admission rates of corneal perforation were high. Small perforations often could be managed medically without tissue glue.

We began by collecting retrospective clinical findings consisting of descriptions of children in pain. From these descriptions, an item scale was built up comprising overall patterns of behavior specific to pain. Because depression and anxiety-like items occurred very frequently in the descriptions, they were included in the rating scale. The present preliminary report gives the results of the scale, which was tested in 80 children, chosen because they were liable to be in pain. Each child was evaluated by 2 nurses and 2 auxiliaries. Sensitivity and reproducibility were satisfactory. Factorial correspondence analysis showed that both depression and pain items contributed to the first axis, which accounted for 51% of the variance. A second axis was found, which contrasted anxiety and pain items, but it only accounted for 13% of the variance. These results suggest that in young children, pain evoked by severe disease leads to a depression-like reaction that correlates with that pain's intensity. They indicate that in children of pre-school age, pain can be assessed by observing its overall specific patterns.\r"

  ".W": "We have performed single unit analysis of the activity of cells located in the ventral nuclear group of thalamus in a patient with dysesthetic pain below the level of a clinically complete traumatic spinal cord transection at C5. Cells located in the parasagittal plane 14 mm lateral to the midline responded to tactile stimulation in small facial and intraoral receptive fields, which were characteristic of patients without somatosensory abnormality [30]. In this patient the 16 mm lateral parasagittal plane contained cells with receptive fields located on the occiput and neck instead of the upper extremity as would normally be expected. Cells with receptive fields on the neck and occiput had not previously been observed in recordings from single units (n = 531) responding to somatosensory stimulation [30]. Thus, on the basis of their location in a region of thalamus which normally represents parts of the body below the level of the spinal cord transection and their unusual receptive fields adjacent to these same parts of the body, we propose that the cells in the 16 mm lateral plane have lost their normal afferent input. Analysis of the autopower spectra of spike trains indicates that cells in the 16 mm lateral plane exhibited a higher mean firing rate and greater tendency to fire in bursts than cells in the 14 mm lateral plane (P less than 0.005). Finally, electrical stimulation at the recording sites in the 16 mm lateral plane evoked a burning sensation in the occiput, neck and upper extremity. These results suggest that regions of thalamus which have lost their normal somatosensory input contain neurons which exhibit abnormal spontaneous and evoked activity and that electrical stimulation of these regions can produce the sensation of burning dysesthesia.\r"

In viral respiratory or gastrointestinal infections there usually was little or no spontaneous IL-1 production from monocytes, and the values did not differ from those of children with no infections or inflammatory disease. Lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1 production from monocytes was slightly but not significantly greater in bacterial infections than in viral infections and controls. Tuberculin (purified protein derivative)-induced IL-1 production from monocytes of patients with viral infections was significantly less than in bacterial infections and also slightly less than in controls. These results indicate that systemic bacterial infections activate spontaneous release of IL-1 from monocytes whereas uncomplicated viral infections usually do not. Tuberculin-inducible IL-1 activity of monocytes appears decreased in viral infections; this might be associated with suppressed cell-mediated immunity in such infections.\r"

Children from two clinical settings were studied: primarily black lower-class children at an inner-city hospital (n = 188) and primarily white middle-class children at a suburban hospital (n = 45). We found an overall prevalence of bacteremia of 7.3%, which was not statistically different between two hospitals. A response to antipyretic therapy, defined as a decrease in temperature of at least 1 degrees C, was seen in 83.7% of children. Children who did not respond to antipyretics had no more increased prevalence of bacteremia than did responders. We conclude that lack of fever response to antipyretics is not a clinical marker for bacteremia in children.\r"

The initial patient evaluation includes a history, physical examination, lab tests, and a report summary, all of which culminate in an F.E.S. exercise prescription. The interim patient evaluation is performed for continuation-termination purposes as well as to progress the patient through the various F.E.S. exercise modalities. Specific F.E.S. exercise progression criteria are summarized. The medical criteria are presented with respect to both patient participation in the F.E.S. exercise program and patient monitoring during the exercise itself. Specific medical criteria for patient participation in A.P.T. are organized around eight functional categories: a) level of neurological injury, b) muscular system, c) skeletal system, subdivided into bone criteria and joint criteria, d) cardiovascular system, e) respiratory system, f) urogenital system, g) cutaneous system, and h) psychological system. The medical criteria for patient monitoring during F.E.S. exercise are discussed with respect to: a) cardiovascular monitoring, b) objective patient monitoring, and c) F.E.S. exercise system monitoring. The article concludes with a discussion of informed consent when applied to an emerging treatment modality.\r"

  ".W": "Previously the application of stimuli of 600 Hz at adjustable strength applied to a muscle's nerve has been proposed as a means of reducing the muscle's contraction in spastic conditions, or when combined with a second tetanic stimulation, of limiting contraction to smaller, physiologically more relevant motor units in the paralyzed state. The side-effects on muscle spindles of such stimuli as seen in the cat's gastrocnemius are reported. During stimulation axonal impulses followed faithfully for periods running into minutes. After stimulation, a pause in ongoing firing with a duration dependent on stimulus-train length and a two-phased recovery occurred. Responses to dynamic stretch of the muscle were affected as well. The contractions of intrafusal fibers activated in several ways was seen to strongly offset the depression. In a clinical application, nevertheless, short-lived depression of all proprioceptive modalities following stimulation should be expected, with corresponding disturbance on sensory perception and reflex effects.\r"

  ".W": "From over 100 children studied with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose and positron emission tomography we selected 29 children (aged 5 days to 15.1 years) who had suffered transient neurological events not significantly affecting normal neurodevelopment. These 29 children were reasonably representative of normal children and provided an otherwise unobtainable population in which to study developmental changes in local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (lCMRGlc). In infants less than 5 weeks old lCMRGlc was highest in sensorimotor cortex, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellar vermis. By 3 months, lCMRGlc had increased in parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices; basal ganglia; and cerebellar cortex. Frontal and dorsolateral occipital cortical regions displayed a maturational rise in lCMRGlc by approximately 6 to 8 months. Absolute values of lCMRGlc for various grey matter regions were low at birth (13 to 25 mumol/min/100 gm), and rapidly rose to reach adult values (19 to 33 mumol/min/100 gm) by 2 years. lCMRGlc continued to rise until, by 3 to 4 years, it reached values of 49 to 65 mumol/min/100 gm in most regions. These high rates were maintained until approximately 9 years, when they began to decline, and reached adult rates again by the latter part of the second decade. The highest increases of lCMRGlc over adult values occurred in cerebral cortical structures; lesser increases were seen in subcortical structures and in the cerebellum. This time course of lCMRGlc changes matches that describing the process of initial overproduction and subsequent elimination of excessive neurons, synapses, and dendritic spines known to occur in the developing brain. The determination of changing metabolic patterns accompanying normal brain development is a necessary prelude to the study of abnormal brain development with positron emission tomography.\r"

Cerebral blood flow exhibited similar but more variable reductions. By contrast, cortical rCMRGlc in the locked-in patients was 5.08 +/- 0.69, a 25% reduction (p less than 0.02) from normal. The massive reduction in vegetative rCMRGlc involved not only the cerebral cortex but also the basal nuclei and cerebellum. Such metabolic hypoactivity has precedent only in deep anesthesia and supports clinical evidence that cerebral cognitive function is lost in the vegetative state, leaving a body that can no longer think or experience pain.\r"

Results obtained in patients were compared, using Student's t test, to those obtained in 6 neurologically normal, elderly volunteers. Cerebral blood flow and the cerebral blood flow/cerebral blood volume ratio were both significantly decreased (p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.05, respectively) in the anterior borderzone ipsilateral to the carotid stenosis. In the same region there was a tendency toward a rising fractional extraction of oxygen with the oxygen metabolism maintained in the low-normal range. Cerebral blood flow was also significantly decreased (p less than 0.05) in the contralateral anterior borderzone.

One of the mutants, TK-altered (TKA) HSV-2(9637), was ACV resistant but induced the incorporation of [14C]thymidine into the DNA of infected rabbit skin cells. The nucleotide sequence of the tk gene of mutant TKA HSV-2(9637) had a single change (G to A) at nucleotide 668, which would cause an arginine-to-histidine substitution at amino acid residue 223 of the TK polypeptide. The second ACV-resistant mutant, TK- HSV-2(8710), did not induce detectable incorporation of [14C]thymidine into the DNA of infected rabbit skin cells. This mutant exhibited a deletion of a single base at nucleotide 217 of its nucleotide sequence. This deletion would cause a frameshift mutation at amino acid residue 73 and chain termination at amino acid residue 86 of the TK polypeptide. The nucleotide sequence of TK+ HSV-2(8703) was the same as that of the laboratory strain, TK+ HSV-2(333). The nucleotide sequence of a bromodeoxyuridine-resistant TK- HSV-2(333) mutant of TK+ HSV-2(333) also exhibited a single-base deletion, but at nucleotide 439.

The inactivation, which occurred within 1 min of virus exposure to the drug, was independent of temperature but dependent upon the pH and molecular size of the polypeptide. Poly-L-histidine consisting of 24 residues (His-24), with a molecular weight (m.w.) of 3,310, inactivated greater than 99% of the virus present at pH 6.0 and 62% at pH 5.0. Poly-L-histidine consisting of 64 (His-64; average m.w., 8,800) or 75 residues (His-75; average m.w., 10,300) inactivated greater than 99% of virus present at pH 5.0 and 6.0. However, His-24, -64, and -75 were not active against these viruses at pH 7.0 or 8.0. At the concentrations tested, poly-L-histidine of 12 (His-12; m.w., 1,665) or 18 (His-18; m.w., 2,487) residues had no effect on HSV-1 or HSV-2 at any of the pHs tested. When these studies were repeated with other basic homologous polypeptides, poly-L-arginine and poly-L-lysine, various degrees of inactivation were observed that were most pronounced in the neutral-to-alkaline pH range. Once virus was inactivated by poly-L-histidine, the effect could not be reversed in vitro by raising the pH to 7.2 or in vivo by injecting the virus into the neutral environment of an animal. These data suggest that the presence of histidine residues in a peptide of suitable structure may endow that peptide with potent antiviral capabilities.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 31 strains of Mycobacterium avium complex isolated from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome were tested for susceptibility to 30 antimicrobial agents by using microdilution trays containing dried antimicrobial agents. MICs were determined over a period of 7 days of growth in a broth medium (7HSF) that is equivalent to 7H11 agar. MICs obtained by this method showed good agreement with MICs determined by the agar dilution method. Strains could be divided into two groups by their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. All group 1 strains (8 of the 31 strains tested) were at least moderately susceptible to inhibition by a variety of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefmenoxime. Group 2 strains (23 of 31) were susceptible only to amikacin (22 of 23 strains). All 31 strains were resistant to oxacillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, nitrofurantoin, and aztreonam at the highest concentration of antimicrobial agent present in the microdilution trays. The addition of Tween 80 to 7HSF broth increased the susceptibility of M. avium complex to many of the antimicrobial agents tested. Killing of M. avium complex (i.e., less than or equal to 1% survival after 7 days) was found to vary for different strains and antimicrobial agents. Killing of some strains by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, carbenicillin, azlocillin, cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, amikacin, and ampicillin occurred at concentrations of antimicrobial agent that are achievable in serum. Further studies are needed to determine whether any of these antimicrobial agents has activity against M. avium complex cells that have been ingested by macrophages.\r"

Clones were selected from four strains: susceptible (S), resistant (R1), selected by plating on ceftriaxone-containing agar, and highly resistant (R2), selected in ceftriaxone-treated mice infected with S clones. According to 14C-labeled beta-lactam binding assays, ceftriaxone resistance was not associated with altered target proteins. R1 and R2 clones stably produced 50 to 1,500 times more beta-lactamase than S clones; this production increased after cefoxitin induction in all S and some R1 clones. Experiments conducted with strain 218 suggested that ceftriaxone resistance involved beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Half-lives for the beta-lactamase-beta-lactam complexes at 37 degrees C were 0.4 and 2.2 min for ceftriaxone and Sch 34343, a drug not affected by the resistance, respectively; in chromatography experiments, 218 intact R1 cells (2 x 10(9) to 3 x 10(9) CFU) suspended in ceftriaxone-containing buffer (2 micrograms/ml) hydrolyzed 80% of the antibiotic in 30 min. Three observations also suggested decreased permeability in some clones, (i) Most of the R1 and R2 clones showed decreased expression of outer membrane proteins of 37,000 to 38,000 molecular weight (37K to 38K proteins) by electrophoresis, often associated with increased amounts of 42K protein. (ii) [14C]Sch 34343 labeling of intact cells proceeded more slowly in 218 R2 (with altered 37K to 38K proteins) than in 218 R1 (without this alteration), a difference persisting after competition with unlabeled cloxacillin. Delays in binding were not caused by different enzymatic activities, since 218 R1 and 218 R2 produce, in similar amounts, beta-lactamases undistinguishable in isoelectric point and Km of cephaloridine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The responses of 20 ampicillin-susceptible Haemophilus influenzae type b clinical isolates to the bactericidal action of ampicillin were studied by using a modified agar dilution plate count method. A well-defined paradoxical effect was observed in each of the 24-h killing curve patterns for 19 of the 20 isolates, the remaining isolate showing a less-well-defined but suggestive paradoxical effect after 48 h of ampicillin exposure. For each isolate, the lowest 24-h persister percentage representing maximum killing (paradoxical trough percentage) occurred over a narrow range of concentrations immediately above the MIC, with such paradoxical trough percentages for the 20 isolates ranging from greater than 0.1 to less than 0.001%. Three isolates selected to represent slow, intermediate, and rapid responses were investigated by repetition of 24-h studies and by determination of expanded killing curve patterns. Resultant agar dilution plate count killing curve patterns were found to be reproducible and strain dependent and served to characterize each isolate. The paradoxical effect became more distinct with the prolongation of ampicillin action. Maximum killing was again evident for a narrow range of ampicillin concentrations immediately above the MIC, with persister percentages rising rapidly over the next few ampicillin concentrations to peak at 1 to 2 log10 increments higher than trough percentages. Based on the broad range of responses observed for the 20 isolates, the consistent presence of the paradoxical effect, and the time-dependent nature of bactericidal action, we suggest that the MBC and MBC/MIC ratios are inadequate indices of bactericidal action and that the all-or-none concept of \"antimicrobial tolerance\" should be abandoned.\r"

In time-kill assays, a 2 to 3 log10 killing effect was observed with LY against two Bla+ strains of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis and against three strains that were highly resistant to streptomycin and gentamicin. Synergism was demonstrated with LY and streptomycin against a Bla+ strain lacking high-level streptomycin resistance.

Drug treatment of infected cells did not alter the amounts or sizes of the 35S and 22S subgenomic viral RNAs. The translation abilities of poly(A)+ RNA derived from M-IBDET-treated cells was also unaffected, as judged by cell-free translation analysis. Poly(A)+ RNA derived from M-IBDET-treated cells directed translation of equal amounts of viral gag precursors, gPr-80gag and Pr-65gag, as did poly(A)+ RNA prepared from untreated cells. The addition of M-IBDET to a cell-free translation system programmed with either total poly(A)+ RNA extracted from infected cells or hybrid-selected viral RNA inhibited the synthesis of viral protein precursors. An examination of the effect of M-IBDET on polysomes engaged in the translation of viral proteins revealed a fourfold accumulation of polysomal virus-specific RNA in drug-treated cells. These results suggest that the inhibition of Moloney leukemia virus by M-IBDET involves a block in the translation of viral RNA rather than interference with viral RNA transcription.\r"

Values for penetration into tissue cages in rabbits were 139% +/- 45% for ticarcillin and 109% +/- 22% for clavulanic acid. The penetration of clavulanic acid into rabbit cerebrospinal fluid was higher (P less than 0.05) (4.0% +/- 0.61%) than that of ticarcillin (1.3% +/- 0.53%). Overall, the results show that ticarcillin and clavulanic acid distribute readily throughout body tissues and fluids and predict that the penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor would be present together at sites of infection.\r"

The age specific incidence in the most susceptible age group (0-4 years) was 31/100,000/year (440 cases), which is higher than previously reported from Europe. A further 30 cases were seen in children aged 5-14. The risk of developing H influenzae meningitis before the age of 15 was 1 in 669. There were 11 deaths (2%) and five cases of serious neurological sequelae among the children. Only 18 children (4%) had predisposing diseases. All but one of the 294 strains of H influenzae from children that had been serotyped were type b. Infections in adults differed from infections in children. Five of the adults died (17%), 12 had important predisposing diseases, and at least six of the infections were caused by non-typable strains. It is concluded that research into the prevention of invasive H influenzae infections in children should have high priority.\r"

RA SF suppressed the responsiveness of a mouse T cell line (HT-2) to IL-2, indicating that it contained an inhibitor of the IL-2 response. When RA SF was fractionated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, the inhibitory activity was detected mainly in fractions with a molecular weight of approximately 150,000, but was also found in a 15-19-kd fraction. Removal of IgG from the 150-kd fraction, by means of an anti-IgG affinity column, did not reduce the activity of the fraction, nor was activity found in the eluted IgG. The inhibitory fractions reduced mouse thymocyte proliferative responses to IL-1 in the presence of phytohemagglutinin, and reduced the production of IL-2 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but did not inhibit IL-1-induced human foreskin fibroblast proliferation; this suggests that the factor was not an IL-1 inhibitor. The inhibitory activity of the RA SF factor was blocked by an antibody against an inhibitor of IL-2 that was purified from a culture of the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. This finding also supports the conclusion that RA SF contains an IL-2 inhibitory factor. The observed inhibition of both IL-2 synthesis and IL-2 response suggests that the target of the inhibition was the T lymphocyte.\r"

Although this process has been shown to occur following the specific binding of the 110-120 kD externalized envelope molecule of the virus with the CD4 glycoprotein, the region of the HIV envelope that directly mediates cell fusion is unknown. In an attempt to identify this fusion domain, we compared the amino acid sequences from the envelope molecules of several HIV isolates to the fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses. We found that the amino terminal region of the HIV transmembrane protein gp41 had a striking degree of similarity with the fusion domain of the respiratory syncytial virus. Moreover, similar sequences were noted in the fusion proteins of other paramyxoviruses and the transmembrane envelope proteins of a variety of lentiviruses suggesting that a functional relationship exists between these glycoproteins. This finding indicates that the amino terminal region of the HIV gp41 molecule may mediate cell fusion for this virus, and could be an important target in the design of immunologic strategies for the prevention of HIV infection in vivo.\r"

We have confirmed the susceptibility of EBV transformed B lymphocytes to productive HIV infection, and have evaluated the cytotoxic activity of HIV seronegative and seropositive donors after sensitization by their autologous EBV infected (monoinfected) or EBV and HIV infected (coinfected) transformed cell lines in a 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay. When sensitized by the coinfected cell line and assayed against monoinfected and coinfected cell lines, the cytotoxic activity of the seronegative donors was inhibited when compared to the cytotoxic effectors sensitized by the monoinfected B cell line. The inhibition appeared to be unrelated to direct HIV infection of the T4 effector cells and was reversible by addition of recombinant interleukin-2. Although deficient in their EBV cytotoxic activity in comparison to the seronegative donors, the HIV seropositive donors lysed the coinfected cell line better than the monoinfected cell line, whether or not HIV superinfected cells were used during the sensitization phase. In HIV seronegative donors, HIV may inhibit the immune response to EBV transformed B lymphocytes. This inhibition is not observed in HIV seropositive donors. These studies suggest the development of cytolytic effector mechanisms directed at HIV infected cells during HIV infection.\r"

The detailed analysis of T-cell distribution in the burned mouse, and the analysis of activation markers L3T4/Lyt-2 and Ia, reveals characteristic changes including the presence of \"activated\" suppressor cells during post-injury suppression. Studies of humoral markers suggest an increased production of IgG in burned animals upon sheep red blood cells (SRBC) challenge, accompanied by increased clearance or catabolism of serum antibody, which results in depressed serum levels. Finally, in vitro phagocytosis studies using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled killed bacteria reveal that burn patient sera are clearly defective in their ability to promote opsonization of one or more specific organisms by neutrophils. The addition of exogenous IgG to the incubation medium improves this response, suggesting that postburn phagocytic depression is an opsonic defect, rather than an inhibitory effect of burn serum on neutrophils.\r"

These are the release of neutrophil elastase and the generation of oxidants. Both events can lead to severe pulmonary injury as has been demonstrated in experimental animals. To better understand the mechanisms of oxidant damaged cells, H2O2 was added to cultured cells. H2O2 compromises a multitude of cellular functions, the combination of which leads to cell death. DNA is an important target for oxidant-induced injury. The formation of DNA strand breaks leads to activation of pADP-RP which in turn causes depletion of NAD and ATP, followed by Ca++ influx and eventually cell lysis. Inhibition of pADP-RP prevented cell lysis, but not DNA damage. A similar sequence of events has been described for cell injury following DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation and alkylating agents and was proposed to be a suicide mechanism for cells with irreversibly damaged DNA. Sublethal doses of H2O2 will delay cell replication, but not necessarily prevent it.\r"

The findings were: (1) preoperative rcbf in the improved group was lower than that in normal controls but was the same as that in SDAT; however, the ratios of rcbf values in anterior and posterior brain regions were significantly different between improved group and SDAT (p = 0.02); (2) an anterior/posterior ratio of 1.05 correctly classified surgical outcome in 19/22 patients; five of six in the unimproved group were above this cut off while 14/16 in the improved group were below; (3) in the improved group rcbf increased at 2 but not at 6 months after surgery without a corresponding reduction of clinical signs, supporting the notion that increase in cbf probably does not account for clinical improvement in normal pressure hydrocephalus.\r"

Recently, it has been postulated that a suppressor-type cell deficiency may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the synovitis. In addition, an immune component may contribute to the synovial alterations in certain examples of degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis, OA). Using monoclonal antibodies, we evaluated synovial tissue lymphocytes in 12 patients with RA, 2 with juvenile RA, one with adult Still's disease, and 2 patients with OA synovitis in order to delineate the T cell subset patterns. Helper-type cells predominated in 3 patients with RA, while suppressor-type cells were present in equal or greater numbers in 9. The patients with OA showed helper-type cell predominance. Helper-type to suppressor-type cell ratios vary widely in RA synovia which militates against the primacy of the role of a suppressor-type cell deficiency in this disorder. Patients with OA synovitis may display T cell infiltrates comprised mainly of helper-type cells.\r"

The results indicate that, when available in the patient's record, abdominal CT scans provide substantial additional information in the evaluation of degenerative changes of the sacroiliac joints at no extra cost. The authors' results also suggest that after the age of 55, the patient's age does not seem to influence the extent of sacroiliac joint narrowing, which does appear to be affected by the presence of coexisting diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.\r"

Twenty-four patients were studied of whom 21 had histologically proven SCC of the head and neck. The remaining 3 had benign lesions. Planar imaging of patients with primary disease revealed a sensitivity of 83% and a 75% specificity. The results of planar imaging of patients with cervical metastases yielded a 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Seven patients also had single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) which improved the image quality, spatial resolution and sensitivity of the investigation. Tc99m (v) DMSA imaging provides a cheap and rapid means of investigating head and neck SCC. This study suggests further work is indicated to assess its role in diagnosis and subsequent management.\r"

HIV seropositivity was present in at least 5 (50%) of the 10 female partners of hemophiliacs with severe depletion of T-helper cells (less than 100/microliters), including 3 (43%) of the 7 female partners of hemophiliacs with AIDS. All 4 HIV seropositive women with available data had vaginal intercourse without a condom, but risk of seropositivity did not appear to be affected by the frequency of vaginal intercourse or by hysterectomy. Other sexually transmitted diseases, anal intercourse, or vaginal intercourse during menstrual periods were not necessary for HIV infection. These data suggest that heterosexual transmission of HIV can occur during routine vaginal intercourse but that it usually does not occur until the hemophiliac has severe immune deficiency late in the course of HIV infection.\r"

The V alpha gene segments belong to 12 different subfamilies, each containing from one to seven members. Comparisons with the 16 different V alpha and 21 different J alpha sequences previously reported suggest that the germ-line repertoires for these gene segments are greater than previously estimated. Flexibility in the sites of gene segment joining and possibly N-region diversification also contribute to human alpha-chain diversity. Comparisons of human V alpha regions indicate a high degree of variability spread uniformly across the entire V alpha region without obvious hypervariable regions. However, amino acids important for the maintenance of V gene structure are conserved.\r"

Codons ending in uracil or adenine, especially ACU, predominate over ACC and ACG. This bacterium contains two isoacceptor threonine tRNAs having anticodon sequences AGU and UGU, both with unmodified first nucleotides. It would thus appear that ACN codons are translated in an unusual way; tRNA(Thr)(AGU) would translate the most abundantly used codon ACU exclusively, because adenine at the first anticodon position can, according to the wobble rule, pair only with uracil of the third codon position. The tRNA(Thr)(UGU) would mainly be responsible for translation of three other codons, ACA, ACG, and ACC. Anticodon UGU would also be used for reading codon ACU as a redundancy of tRNA(Thr)-(AGU), as deduced from the mitochondrial code where unmodified uracil at the first anticodon position can pair with adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil by four-way wobble. The tRNA(Thr)(AGU) has much higher sequence homology to tRNA(Thr)(UGU) from M. capricolum (88%), Bacillus subtilis (77%) and Escherichia coli (86%) than to tRNA(Thr)(GGU) from B. subtilis (66%) and E. coli (63%), suggesting that tRNA(Thr)-(AGU) has been derived from tRNA(Thr)(UGU), but not from tRNA(Thr)(GGU).\r"

The cumulative-dose technique was used to obtain 95% twitch depression (vecuronium: initial bolus 15 micrograms kg-1, increments 6 micrograms kg-1; atracurium: initial bolus 100 micrograms kg-1, increments 40 micrograms kg-1). Using ED95 values derived from the log-probit dose-response curves, vecuronium was 4.6 times more potent than atracurium. The durations of action of the initial cumulative-doses (from end of injection of the last increment to 25% recovery) were 11.1 +/- 3.3 min for vecuronium and 16.2 +/- 3.9 min for atracurium (P less than 0.05). In terms of duration of action of the maintenance doses (vecuronium one-quarter of the total incremental dose; atracurium one-third) some cumulation was observed with vecuronium (interaction time X treatment; cumulation ratio 1.46 +/- 0.31 v. 0.98 +/- 0.10 for atracurium, P less than 0.001). After 2 h of surgery, the mean recovery times (25% to 75% twitch height) did not differ (18.5 +/- 2.8 min and 16.7 +/- 4.4 min).

Blood-gas measurements were performed with the horse in the lateral position during spontaneous breathing (before selective intubation) and in dorsal recumbency during spontaneous breathing, general mechanical ventilation, and spontaneous breathing + selective mechanical ventilation. Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) was 32.3 kPa in the lateral position during spontaneous breathing with a high inspired oxygen fraction (FlO2 greater than 92%). In dorsal recumbency PaO2 decreased to 10.9 kPa during spontaneous breathing and was not significantly affected by general mechanical ventilation (PaO2 12.6 kPa). The institution of selective mechanical ventilation with a selective positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cm H2O caused a marked increase in PaO2 to an average of 35.3 kPa. It is concluded that selective intubation of dependent regions in the diaphragmatic lobes is a feasible procedure and that selective mechanical ventilation with PEEP markedly improves arterial oxygenation in the anaesthetized horse in dorsal recumbency.\r"

Very high risk of melanoma appears to exist in two rare groups: persons with dysplastic naevi whose families include at least two individuals who have had melanoma, and persons with giant congenital naevi. Risks of melanoma in other individuals with dysplastic naevi and in persons with small congenital naevi have not yet been quantified. Much of the published work on risk of melanoma in relation to naevi has been based on clinical series or assemblage of case reports, with great potential for bias. In such studies, naevi have often been classified into dichotomies or syndromes originally defined for pathological or clinical purposes, frequently using poorly reproducible criteria. Case-control and cohort studies of the relationship of naevi to melanoma are needed, which use reproducible criteria and designs minimizing bias, and which examine risk in relation to graded clinical and histological measures of naevi.\r"

No changes were found in serum apolipoprotein A-1, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), carnitine, lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose or insulin. We therefore found no evidence that the hyperlipidaemia of isotretinoin therapy is due to increased fluxes of NEFA from adipose tissue to the liver, although we cannot exclude the possibility that there are changes in the proportion of NEFA being esterified to triglyceride or undergoing beta-oxidation. We suggest that the hyperlipidaemia induced by isotretinoin may be due to an increase in circulating lipoprotein from increased production or impaired catabolism.\r"

Two groups of children undergoing minor eye surgery under nitrous oxide-oxygen-halothane anaesthesia were examined. The experimental group (n = 17) received 2 mg/kg lignocaine and the controls (n = 18) an equivalent volume of saline. The incidence of local laryngeal and ocular reflexes was much lower in the lignocaine group. Pulse acceleration was significantly lower in the lignocaine group (p less than 0.025), and the maximal mean intraocular pressure was significantly less than in the control group (p less than 0.005). Other ocular reactions were recorded, and all were attenuated after lignocaine administration. The beneficial effects of lignocaine, a suppressant of autonomic reflexes, suggest that intraocular pressure, like the heart rate, rises after intubation as a result of autonomic stimulation. The use of intravenous lignocaine is thus recommended for children at risk, such as those needing an urgent operation because of lacerated eye injury under rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia.\r"

The mean corneal oxygen uptake rate in the centre of the graft was 3.88 (SD 0.55) mmHg/s and in the control eye was 4.29 (SD 0.62) mmHg/s. In the temporal host periphery the results for the grafted and control eyes were 4.52 (SD 0.54) mmHg/s and 4.26 (SD 0.52) mmHg/s respectively. The differences in the oxygen uptake rate between the centre of the graft cornea and the contralateral control eye and between the centre and periphery of the graft eye were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The central corneal touch threshold of the graft eye showed good recovery in four patients, while the remaining 12 had no or minimal recovery. The central and temporal epithelial and corneal thicknesses of the graft and the control eyes were not significantly different. The central endothelial cell density was 1383 cells/mm2 in the graft and 3053 cells/mm2 in the control eye. As corneal oxygen uptake reflects changes in aerobic epithelial metabolism, it is possible that there is a link between loss of neural integrity of graft epithelium and lowered epithelial aerobic metabolism following penetrating keratoplasty.\r"

Thus, HCs can be demonstrated in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen specimens from hairy cell leukemia (HCL) patients even when they constitute less than 1% of the cell suspension. Likewise, admixture experiments with normal mononuclear cells and the MOLT-4 T-acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell line demonstrated that HCs could be detected in amounts as low as 1%. The validity of this assay has been ascertained by the lack of double marker positivity in cell suspensions from B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients that only expressed B1 or SHCL-3, respectively. Furthermore, other malignant blood diseases, including malignant lymphomas, acute leukemias, and chronic leukemias disclosed no double marker positive cells. In a clinical setting, this assay was used for purifying HCs (by flow cytometry) from the peripheral blood from patients with no apparent morphological evidence of circulating HC infiltration and for monitoring the effect of interferon therapy. In conclusion, this assay should be of value for both diagnosis and monitoring patients with HCL.\r"

Direct bone marrow preparations revealed the presence of two leukemic clones 46,XY,del(6)(q23q25) and 45,X,-4,del(6)(q23q25),+8,-15,-21,+i(21q), +mar, the former clearly indicating that male donor cells were involved in the malignant process. Relapse as evidenced by these chromosome anomalies was confined to metaphases from directly prepared marrow cells and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood cells. Cytogenetic analyses of T cell colonies gave predominantly normal donor karyotypes (65 of 69 mitoses) along with three host mitoses and a single donor metaphase carrying the 6q- anomaly. The marrow stroma, as represented by first-passage adherent layer cells from long-term marrow cultures, showed 17 of 19 host metaphases. One of two donor cells found within the stromal elements exhibited a 6q- chromosome. In the subsequent remission mitoses derived from myeloid and lymphoid cells were exclusively of donor origin, and chromosomal abnormalities could no longer be detected. Stromal elements remained host-derived (14 of 16 mitoses).\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody, designated BM-1, which is reactive in B5 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, has been generated against a cytoplasmic and nuclear antigen expressed in human myeloid precursor cells and derived leukemias. Using the avidin-biotin-complex immunoperoxidase procedure, BM-1 was found to stain selectively myeloid precursor cells in normal bone marrow and mature granulocytes in the blood. In a screen of 26 normal adult and fetal human organs fixed in B5 formalin, BM-1 was negative in all nonhematopoietic tissues with the exception of tissue granulocytes and scattered cells in the peripheral cortex of the thymus. Likewise a screen of 30 solid tumor cell lines including a spectrum of carcinomas, sarcomas, and neural-derived tumors was negative. BM-1 was also negative with 21 T and B cell lymphomas and 11 Hodgkin's disease tumors. A preliminary study of tumors of the hematopoietic system revealed that BM-1 was reactive with M2 and M3 acute myelogenous leukemias (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) and myelomonocytic leukemias, and granulocytic sarcomas. M1, M4, M5, and M6 AML clot preparations were negative in this study, indicating that BM-1 may have a role in the histopathologic diagnosis of myelogenous leukemia. Myeloid leukemic cell lines HL-60, ML-2, KG1, and TPH-1-O showed BM-1 nuclear and/or cytoplasmic reactivity in a subpopulation of cells, but erythroid and lymphoid leukemias and all lymphoma cell lines were negative. Immunoperoxidase studies of a panel of fetal tissues showed BM-1 positive cells in the peripheral cortex of the thymus and portal myelopoietic regions of the liver at 18 weeks gestation. Finally, DNA-cellulose and solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques developed in our laboratory demonstrate that the BM-1 antigenic domain is reactive only after binding to eukaryotic but not prokaryotic single- or double-stranded DNA. Immunoblot techniques using a DNA-cellulose purified protein sample revealed that BM-1 recognizes a 183 kD protein. These studies indicate that BM-1 is recognizing a myeloid-specific antigen that, because of its DNA binding characteristics, may have an important role in the differentiation of myeloid cells at the molecular level.\r"

In this study we have established that exposure of murine Dexter cultures to LiCl (4 mEq/L) causes an increase of colony-forming cell megakaryocytes (CFU-meg) over 1 to 6 weeks of culture in both supernatant (188% to 611%) and stromal phases (123% to 246%). Moreover, we have shown that lithium treatment of either irradiated (1,100 rad) or unirradiated stromal cells increased production of activities stimulating formation of megakaryocyte, granulocyte, macrophage, and mixed lineage colonies and proliferation of the factor-dependent cell line, FDC-P1. This FDC-P1 stimulatory activity was completely blocked by an antibody to purified recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rGM-CSF). The baseline or lithium-induced--stromal-derived bone marrow colony stimulating activity was partially blocked by the antibody to rGM-CSF and by an antibody to purified colony stimulating factor I (CSF-1); the two antibodies combined resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of the lithium-induced marrow stimulatory activity. In addition, radioimmunoassay (RIA) showed that although CSF-1 was detectable in supernatants of these cultures, exposure to lithium did not increase CSF-1 levels. These data indicate that Dexter stromal cells produce CSF-1 and GM-CSF and that lithium appears to exert its stimulatory effects on in vitro myelopoiesis by inducing production of GM-CSF.\r"

  ".U": "88001000\r", 
  ".W": "A cell line with immature blast cell morphology was isolated from HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell cultures and designated HL-T. This new cell type is biphenotypic, expressing terminal transferase (TdT) together with myelomonocytoid immunologic features. TdT enzymatic activity, undetectable in HL-60, was determined to be 140 to 180 units/10(8) HL-T cells by the dGTP-assay, approximately 20% of the activity found in lymphoblastoid cell lines. HL-T predominantly synthesize the known 58-kDa TdT-protein plus a minor 54/56-kDa doublet. The 58-kDa steady state form is nonglycosylated and is phosphorylated. Precursor antigens S3.13 and MY-10, absent on HL-60, are expressed by HL-T; however, the cells are negative for HLA-Dr. Southern blot analysis by hybridization with immunoglobulin heavy chain (JH) and T cell-receptor chain gene (T beta) probes shows JH to be in the germ-line configuration in both cell lines and the T beta gene to be in germ-line in HL-60 but to be rearranged in HL-T. Truncation of the gene encoding the granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), as found in HL-60, is not observed in HL-T. HL-T are resistant to differentiation-induction by retinoic acid and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Cytogenetically HL-T share with HL-60 a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 9 at breakpoint p13, an aberration frequently found in patients with T cell leukemia. In addition, HL-T display t(8;9)(p11;p24) and trisomy 20. Tetraploidy is observed in 80% of HL-T metaphases with aberrations identical to those in the diploid karyotype. Like HL-60, the new line shows some surface-antigenic-T cell characteristics. Despite an antigenic pattern most consistent with that of helper-inducer T cells (T4+, D44+/-, 4B4+, 2H4-, TQ1+/-), HL-T cells and their conditioned culture medium suppress antigen, mitogen, and mixed-leukocyte-culture-mediated lymphocyte proliferation.\r"

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) and spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) showed similar in vitro drug sensitivities. Both the speed of hematologic recovery and survival of mice transplanted with untreated or drug-treated bone marrow were directly related to the number of CFU-GM or CFU-S transplanted. Similar hematologic recovery was seen for untreated marrow transplants and treated transplants that had similar CFU-GM or CFU-S content. There is a minimum number of transplanted CFU-GM or CFU-S that allows survival of lethally irradiated mice. This number is present in a marrow transplant containing the equivalent of 5 X 10(3) untreated cells or producing one to two spleen colonies. There also exists a maximum value for the number of hematopoietic progenitors in a marrow graft, above which the rate of hematologic recovery following transplantation is rapid and no detectable increase in the rate is seen with increasing CFU-GM or CFU-S content. The presence of this maximum value for transplanted progenitors and variations in culture techniques are probably the reasons previous studies have not always shown a correlation between CFU-GM content and hematologic recovery after bone marrow transplantation.\r"

The effect of F-2,6-P2 on the rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis, ie, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase, has also been examined. PFK was activated by this metabolite and the half-maximum activation was obtained at a concentration of 10(-7) mol/L. Neither hexokinase nor pyruvate kinase was affected by F-2,6-P2. These results suggest that human erythrocytes may contain this metabolite as one of the positive effectors for PFK.\r"

This multimeric glycoprotein exhibits a dual role, that of mediating platelet adhesion and aggregation onto thrombogenic surfaces, and that of functioning as carrier in plasma for the factor VIII procoagulant protein. New insights into the nature of the several functional domains of vWF have led to the identification of the regions of the molecule that interact with factor VIII, heparin, the glycoprotein lb of platelets, and collagen. Alterations of vWF are the cause of von Willebrand disease (vWD), a congenital bleeding disorder. In the majority of patients, the plasma levels of vWF are decreased, but there is no demonstrable structural or functional alteration of the protein. In other patients, however, the structure of vWF is abnormal. This review summarizes the current knowledge on vWF and vWD.\r"

  ".W": "A rabbit monospecific antibody for mouse beta-spectrin was used to screen a mouse anemic spleen cDNA expression library. A mouse beta-spectrin cDNA clone was isolated and identified by its ability to make mouse beta-spectrin-like antigens in Escherichia coli. This clone was used to probe total RNA from various mouse tissues. Anemic spleen RNA showed two strongly hybridizing RNA species of approximately 6 and 8 kb. Two very faintly hybridizing bands of about 6 kb and 10 kb could also be seen in total mouse brain RNA. All of these bands could be detected after hybridization under both stringent and nonstringent conditions. This suggests that erythroid beta-spectrin may also be expressed in the brain. No bands could be detected in kidney, liver, or spleen RNA. Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA showed a single hybridizing band after digestion with several restriction endonucleases even under nonstringent conditions. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA insert revealed almost complete identity between the N-terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA clone and the C-terminal 15 amino acids of a peptide derived from the beta-8 repeat unit of human erythrocyte beta-spectrin. The deduced amino acid sequence contained most of the conserved amino acids characteristic of the 106 amino acid repeat unit first found in human alpha-spectrin and thus provides the first evidence for a complete 106 amino acid repeat unit structure in beta-spectrin.\r"

The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome was identified in 18 of these cases (4.9%). Features closely associated with the presence of the Ph chromosome were older age (median, 7.9 years), high leukocyte count (median, 47.3 X 10(9)/L), French-American-British L1 blast cell morphology, high incidence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis, and the common ALL immunophenotype. All patients were treated according to modern chemotherapeutic regimens for ALL used at our institution. Complete remissions were successfully induced in only 13 (72%) of the 18 patients with Ph + ALL, and only six remain free of leukemia for periods of 7+, 9+, 10+, 13+, 49+, and 70+ months. Our findings confirm the association of the Ph chromosome with classic high-risk features of ALL in children and suggest that this abnormality confers a very poor prognosis that has not yet been improved by modifications in established therapeutic regimens.\r"

After this first 6 months, however, patients given T cell-depleted bone marrow had blood T cell frequencies comparable to those observed in patients given untreated marrow. Diminished frequencies of reactive T cells in recipients of depleted marrow could leave them more susceptible to infection or to the recurrence of neoplastic cells.\r"

Unfractionated BM cells from 60 patients were cryopreserved in 300-mL aliquots in both dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a combination known to preserve granulocytes successfully. The cells were frozen without rate-controlled freezing by simple immersion into a -80 degrees C freezer where they remained until the time of reinfusion. The 60 patients underwent 72 autologous transplants after three high-dose chemotherapy regimens: 30 received high-dose carmustine in combination, five received high-dose busulfan and cyclophosphamide, and 37 received high-dose aziridinylbenzoquinone. The BM was infused for more than 30 minutes after rapid thawing at 37 degrees C. The mean post-thaw nucleated cell recovery was 96% +/- 11.6%, and Trypan blue dye exclusion was 82.2% +/- 9.2%. The mean postthaw CFU-GM and BFU-E recoveries were 81.9% +/- 39.0% and 90.5% +/- 41.2%. Complete count recovery occurred in 68 of 72 transplants. Median times to a WBC count greater than 1,000/microL, a granulocyte count greater than 1,000/microL and a platelet count greater than 20,000/microL were 15, 21, and 15 days, respectively. Risk factors for delayed recovery were not found. Unfractionated BM cells can be successfully cryopreserved in the DMSO/HES mixture rapidly and inexpensively, without rate-controlled freezing or storage at liquid nitrogen temperatures.\r"

Medial incision of the anterior rectus sheath significantly reduced the time required to perform the incision (P less than 0.02) and tended to reduce wound sepsis rate. However, this was achieved at the cost of a higher incisional hernia rate (0 per cent, 2.9 per cent and 4.6 per cent in groups A, B and C respectively, P less than 0.02). We conclude that lateral incision of both anterior and posterior rectus sheath is necessary to obviate the risk of wound hernia with the lateral paramedian incision.\r"

The early postoperative results in 1491 patients revealed an incidence of wound infection of 8.6 per cent and of wound dehiscence of 2.3 per cent with no statistically significant differences between the four techniques. We reviewed 1156 patients after 1 year. Wound pain was present in 9.7 per cent of the patients, statistically significantly more in the group closed with nylon (16.7 per cent). Suture sinuses developed in 3.5 per cent of the patients, statistically significantly more frequently in the nylon group (7.7 per cent). The total number of incisional hernias detected 1 year postoperatively was high (15.2 per cent) (interrupted polyglactin 16.9 per cent, continuous polyglactin 20.6 per cent, continuous polydioxanone 13.2 per cent and continuous nylon 10.3 per cent). The difference between nylon and continuous polyglactin is statistically significant.

A histologic examination showed that all the tumors were diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) of immunoblastic type with (one case) or without (two cases) plasmacytoid differentiation. Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections revealed restricted expression of immunoglobulin light chains in one case showing plasmacytoid differentiation.

Histologically, all the paragangliomas exhibited similar features, with a \"Zellballen\" pattern of polygonal cells. All 22 cases were strongly immunoreactive to protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) antisera and moderately reactive to antineuron-specific enolase (NSE) sera. Ten cases (five functional) were focally immunoreactive to antichromogranin sera. Seven cases (four functional) were immunoreactive to neuropeptide Y and enkephalin antisera, and six (five functional) to tyrosine hydroxylase antisera. The clinically functional tumors expressed at least two of the antigens, enkephalin, neuropeptide Y, or tyrosine hydroxylase, whereas none of the 17 nonfunctional possessed more than one of these. Electron microscopic study revealed cells from all the nine cases studied to contain secretory granules. Granule sizes ranged from 100 to 280 nm and the morphologic examination of the secretory granules generally showed a dense core with a membrane-bound halo of variable size. Secretory granules were observed in the five functional cases and these were larger (220-280 nm) than those seen in the nonfunctional tumor cells (100-180 nm). Also, tumor cells from the functional cases contained numerous dilated mitochondrial profiles.\r"

Immunohistochemical studies revealed keratin immunostaining of tumor cells in two cases and staining for neuron-specific enolase in the third. The third case also showed a few dense neurosecretory granules at the ultrastructural level. Although no strong conclusions regarding histogenesis can be drawn, this study indicates that small cell carcinoma of the kidney exists and does not necessarily exhibit a neuroendocrine differentiation. Small cell carcinoma of the kidney must be considered in the differential diagnosis of malignant renal tumor, especially in cases in which a large necrotic tumor is present. Based on the few cases presented in this study and on the one previously reported case, small cell carcinoma of the kidney appears to be an aggressive tumor.\r"

In these studies soft tissue sarcoma cases have been identified from either deaths with malignant neoplasms of the connective tissue (ICD-8 171) as the underlying cause of death, from incident cancer cases with the same topography code, or from incident cases of extraskeletal sarcomas, excluding lympho and reticulosarcomas. The current study shows that the choice of source material has a considerable influence on the registered occurrence of soft tissue sarcomas in a well defined population. In 1978 to 1982 an annual number of 33 deaths from ICD-8 171 was registered in Denmark, whereas the annual number of diagnosed extraskeletal sarcomas was 231. The distribution over histologic types differed between tumours coded to the connective tissue and extraskeletal sarcomas coded to specific organs. Furthermore, during the period 1943 to 1982 the mortality from ICD-8 171 increased slightly, whereas the incidence from all extraskeletal sarcomas decreased slightly, except for males since 1970. Time trends based on any of the three source materials should, however, be interpreted with caution.\r"

The present study is a prospective randomized trial to evaluate patient response to flexible as compared with rigid sigmoidoscopy. Patients reported significantly less discomfort (10.1% versus 29.7%), anxiety (9.8% versus 27.6%) and embarrassment (5.2% versus 12.8%) during flexible as compared with rigid sigmoidoscopy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy appears to have better patient acceptance than rigid sigmoidoscopy (P less than 0.01). This could enhance its value as a cancer-control instrument. This article addresses the feasibility of sigmoidoscopy. Its validity also needs to be addressed within the framework of a long-term trial, evaluating mortality for rectosigmoid cancer.\r"

Of cancer deaths, lung (20%), breast (18%), and colorectal (14%) are most common. Uterine cancer is now the sixth cause of cancer death, after ovary and pancreas, due to the application of cancer detection. with an aging US population, cancer will become an even more significant health issue for women. Cancer in women aged 65 years and older occurs twice as frequently as in those aged 45 to 64 years. Melanoma is becoming an increasingly important public health problem because of its rising incidence during the last 20 years. Preventive strategies can be widely promoted to women in order to lower their cancer risk and to find cancer before symptoms appear. Smoking control, safe sun exposure, and simple recommendations for diet and nutrition can assist women in taking control of their lifestyles to reduce cancer risk. Early cancer detection, as outlined in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Related Checkup Guidelines, can be expected to find breast, colorectal, uterine, and other forms of cancer in asymptomatic women.\r"

  ".W": "The historical developments in the recognition of the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in cells and tissues of the female genital tract are briefly summarized. The identification of a specific marker cell, the koilocyte, has led to initial studies of frequency and biologic significance of neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix associated with HPV. By molecular virology techniques, over 40 types of HPV have been identified and their tissue affinity determined. Types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 31 are most commonly associated with anogenital lesions, among them a broad spectrum of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). While current evidence suggests that lesions associated with HPV Types 6 and 11 are potentially less harmful to the patient than lesions associated with HPV Types 16 and 18 (which have been identified also in invasive cervical carcinomas and cell lines derived therefrom), a major long term prospective study may be required to confirm this view. A factor that complicates the issue still further is the recent observation that HPV DNA of all four types has been identified in 11% of women and 5.5% of men free of disease. Infection with multiple viral types (including Types 16 and 18) was common in this apparently healthy population. Although HPV must be considered as a prime candidate for a transforming virus, current evidence suggests that the infection with the virus is per se an insufficient condition for the development of precancerous lesions or cancer of the uterine cervix and that another factor or factors may be necessary for these events to take place. Some of these possible cofactors such as age, repeated infections, and the immune status of the patient are discussed. A great deal of additional work is required before the precise role of HPV virus in the genesis of carcinoma of the uterine cervix, vulva, and vagina is firmly documented.\r"

With the former, the link to estrogen use is well established. The estrogen use patterns associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer are characteristic of a promotional agent. The example serves as a prototype model for the study of an adverse health effect subsequent to a prescribed medication. However, modification in estrogen prescribing patterns have lowered significantly the endometrial cancer risk for patients. A relationship between estrogen replacement therapy and breast cancer is difficult to assess. Despite biologic plausibility, large epidemiologic studies have shown no association between estrogen use and breast cancer occurrence. Those studies suggesting a relationship find it concentrated in the high dose estrogen products and possibly among women who have had a prior bilateral oophorectomy. A convincing resolution to the current uncertainty is likely to require new approaches in laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic research. Larger studies investigating more refined hypotheses within the same conceptual confines are unlikely to be productive.\r"

Use of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for monitoring gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has set the standard to which other assays must be compared. Beta hCG and alphafetoprotein have provided useful markers for ovarian germ cell tumors. Recently, a monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay for CA 125 antigen has been used to monitor the treatment of epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Persistent elevation of CA 125 in serum has generally reflected persistence of disease at second look surveillance procedures. CA 125 levels can, however, return to within normal limits and residual disease can be found at laparoscopy or laparotomy. CA 125 shows promise for distinguishing benign from malignant pelvic masses. Trials are currently underway to evaluate the potential of CA 125 in combination with other markers to facilitate earlier detection of occult ovarian cancer.\r"

The radiologist has also become more involved in invasive procedures such as percutaneous biopsies, aspirations of fluid collections, and transcatheter intraarterial infusion and occlusions. Although the newer imaging modalities will be emphasized, an attempt will be made to point out both their strengths and weaknesses relative to the older modalities. The discussion will concentrate on ovarian and cervical cancers while the other cancers of the female genital tract will be superficially discussed.

We recently reviewed our experience with patients who were found to have positive periaortic nodes after surgical exploration for clinical Stage IB and Stage IIA cervical cancer. Postoperative extended field radiotherapy was employed with minimum complications and the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 50% with a median survival time of 29 months. In order to justify the utilization of surgical staging for gynecologic neoplasms, it is necessary to demonstrate a survival advantage in patients where the precise extent of disease has been established and subsequent therapy tailored accordingly. In addition, it must be shown that surgical staging does not increase complications or decrease the efficacy of subsequent therapeutic interventions.\r"

The hypothesis is put forth that metastases to regional lymph nodes occurs from the primary lesion as an embolic event leaving the intervening normal tissue bridge at low risk for disease. Indeed, these viable cells, which have the potential for becoming a metastatic focus, may fall victim to the patient's host defense mechanisms. In light of this, recent clinical experience with cancer of the cervix, vulva, and breast, is outlined with particular emphasis on more conservative surgical techniques and their success. A plea is made for individualization of surgical therapy, especially with early lesions affording ample opportunities for preservation of function, body image, and improved quality of life.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 33% of women with invasive ovarian tumors present with what appears to be early epithelial ovarian cancer (FIGO Stages I and II) accounting for approximately 6000 new ovarian cancer cases each year in the United States. A better understanding of the natural history and patterns of spread of this disease has led to an increased awareness of the importance of thorough operative staging, cytoreductive surgery, and accurate determination of the extent of residual disease. These staging studies have documented frequent understaging of such patients. Results from such surgical staging studies indicate that only about 25% of women operated on in the United States have an initial surgical incision adequate to allow evaluation of the entire pelvis and abdominal cavity. As a result about 33% of patients thought to be free of disease at initial surgery have residual disease and in 75% the disease has spread intraabdominally. These studies have important implications for the design of future adjuvant trials. Fortunately, these accurate staging studies have defined groups of patients who require adjuvant treatment as well as those who do not. It is now apparent that certain groups of patients with Stage II and high-risk Stage I disease are at risk for failure throughout the abdominal cavity. Any form of adjuvant therapy, if it is to succeed, must obviously encompass this entire area. With this in mind, several prospective clinical trials have tested a variety of adjuvant approaches. Present evidence would suggest that systemic chemotherapy, intraperitoneal radioisotopes (32P) or whole abdominal irradiation have the potential to eradicate micrometastases throughout the area at risk. The need for adjuvant therapy is dependent upon the accuracy of initial surgical staging. If initial surgical evaluation was incomplete, the five year survival rates for Stage I (70%) and Stage II (40% to 50%) disease are poor enough that most investigators would advocate some sort of adjuvant therapy. However, comprehensive and accurate surgical staging will define subsets of ovarian cancer patients with such good prognoses (five year survival of 90% to 95%) that no adjuvant treatment is required. With the known risk of late second malignancies in ovarian cancer patients treated with long-term adjuvant chemotherapy, the identification of patients who do not require further treatment represents an advance. Accurate surgical staging coupled with proper adjuvant therapy designed to treat areas of high risk have improved the survival rate of patients with early ovarian cancer.\r"

A great many published clinical experiences, some of considerable size, have tended on the one hand to provide apparently contradictory information, and on the other hand to polarize views. A detailed consideration of the many clinical, pathologic, biochemical and kinetic prognostic variables which may bias such clinical experiences will be discussed. These may contribute to differing results from institutions apparently employing a single treatment plan. The prospectively randomized trials which have helped to establish the limits of acceptable therapy for localized breast cancer will also be reviewed together with comments on their limitations. Particular attention will be paid to National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) trial B-06; the Milan Cancer Institute trial; and current National Cancer Institute (NCI) investigations. A thorough consideration of these issues should permit a more rational choice of primary treatment for patients with Stage I and Stage II breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "There are a number of strategies to the treatment of gynecologic tumors that involve the use of biologic agents. Biologic agents may be immunologic in nature and act directly on the tumor or to boost an immune response to the tumor, or they may be nonimmune in nature and directly affect the tumor or a physiologic process on which the tumor depends. Although the potential for these agents in the treatment of all gynecologic tumors is great, most of the data to date have been generated in ovarian cancer. Clinical trials of alpha interferon administered intraperitoneally in patients with small volume ovarian cancer have revealed high response rates with acceptable toxicity. The mechanism of the antitumor effect (i.e., direct tumor killing vs. indirect boosting host immune response) has not yet been determined. Clinical trials of intraperitoneal lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells plus recombinant interleukin-2 have also been started based upon significant antitumor effects noted in xenogeneic systems. The finding that the peritoneal fluid of interferon-treated patients is rich with monocytes and macrophages has led to the development of a clinical trial using intraperitoneal human monocytes activated with recombinant gamma interferon along with gamma interferon. Monoclonal antibodies have already made a significant impact on the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and are being brought to clinical trial as therapeutic agents. The OC-125 antigen is shed by ovarian tumor cells and its elevation in the serum of patients with undiagnosed pelvic masses is highly predictive for ovarian neoplasia. Furthermore, its persistence in the serum of patients with ovarian cancer during chemotherapy is nearly always associated with persistent disease. A number of monoclonal antibodies specific for ovarian cancer have been developed. Radiolabeled antibodies administered intralymphatically and intraperitoneally may be able to demonstrate the presence of tumor reliably enough to save some patients from second-look laparotomy. In addition, clinical trials are underway using immunotoxins, antitumor antibodies conjugated to potent plant or bacterial toxins that are effective at killing cells with amazing efficiency. Antibodies conjugated to alpha-emitting radioisotopes like astatine-211 or to radioisotopes emitting gamma or beta waves or Auger electrons are candidates for clinical trial. There is also some interest in attempting to improve the therapeutic index by using antibodies conjugated to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The goals are to produce effective and specific reagents for both immunodiagnosis and therapy. However, despite an extensive research effort, a clear demonstration of specific cancer-associated antigens in gynecologic malignancies, or of specific immune responses to such antigens has been elusive. Currently, most antibodies found are cross reactive with either oncofetal antigens or some normal adult tissues. Clinical usefulness of these MoAbs as a screening test in radioimaging or in immunotherapy remains to be proven. However, the use of MoAb technology in defined antigens/tumor markers such as beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, and alpha fetal proteins has provided convenient, reproducible and highly specific reagents. More recently, promising antibodies have been shown to detect tumor antigens in serum of patients with ovarian cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The development of acquired resistance has limited the effectiveness of chemotherapy in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Experimental model systems were developed to study the mechanisms associated with primary resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and broad cross-resistance (multidrug resistance) which is characteristic of human ovarian cancer. Doxorubicin-resistant cell lines developed in vitro by exposure of a sensitive cell line to increasing concentrations of doxorubicin develop resistance on the basis of a decrease in drug accumulation and have increased expression of the mdr-1 gene. This gene encodes for a membrane glycoprotein and leads to a decreased drug accumulation in drug resistant cell lines. Cell lines established from patients refractory to doxorubicin-containing combinations, however, do not demonstrate a decrease in drug accumulation. Studies are in progress on the measurement of mdr-1 levels in tumors of patients undergoing treatment to determine whether agents, such as verapamil may be useful in the treatment of drug resistant gynecologic cancers. Human ovarian cancer cell lines from drug resistant patients also has been demonstrated to increase levels of glutathione. Lowering of glutathione levels with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which irreversibly inhibits the enzyme gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase, leads to a marked potentiation of the cytotoxicity of melphalan both in vitro and in vivo in a nude mouse model of human ovarian cancer. Based on those studies, BSO is undergoing toxicologic evaluation before initiation of clinical trials in drug resistant patients. Our studies demonstrate that drug resistance in human ovarian cancer is likely due to interaction of multiple factors. However, biochemical intervention in some of the key steps leading to drug resistance has been demonstrated experimentally feasible and indicates that pharmacologic reversal of drug resistance is a clinical possibility.\r"

In dealing with the wide variety of gynecologic cancers, extreme care must be used in choosing the appropriate treatment program for each problem. Therefore, the full extent of the disease at the time of initial presentation and recurrence must be determined. It is only with these data that appropriate treatment programs can be designed with the maximum potential for long-term control or cure and with the minimum in treatment complication. There are no groups of disease processes like those seen in advanced or recurrent gynecologic cancer that offer such a challenge to the clinical practitioner.\r"

The second group consists of patients who have received unsuccessful primary treatment. Over the past decade the role of surgery in the management of patients with advanced disease has been studied with a view toward a more precise extent of disease evaluation prior to definitive therapy. The potential benefit of pretreatment surgical staging of cervical cancer is considered in this article. The role of pelvic exenteration in the treatment of recurrent cervical cancer has been established for more than 30 years. In this article recent advances in the application of these procedures including better criteria for patient selection, improvement in surgical techniques, and patient rehabilitation are discussed.\r"

For celomic epithelial carcinomas of the ovary, a large number of cytotoxic agents have been shown to be active. Dramatic improvement in frequency of response with lesser improvement in survival has been noted with the use of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy as compared to single alkylating agents. More recent studies have evaluated alternative ways to employ cisplatin: higher dose schedules, intraperitoneal administration, and platinum compounds with a potentially better therapeutic index. None has yet been shown superior to a combination of relatively low-dose cisplatin plus an alkylating agent with or without doxorubicin. Cisplatin remains the best studied and most active single agent in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. While a number of other agents have demonstrated moderate activity, no combination of drugs has as yet proved superior to single-agent cisplatin. In endometrial carcinoma, progestins and doxorubicin are the most active agents. Tamoxifen, cisplatin, and hexamethylmelamine appear to have moderate activity. No combination has yet been shown to be superior to single agents. Information on chemotherapy for less common gynecologic malignancies is largely anecdotal. Two observations are of note. Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is highly active against germ-cell neoplasms of the ovary. Cisplatin also has definite activity against mixed mesodermal sarcoma of the uterus.\r"

Several recent studies which have quantified the risk of treatment-induced cancers following gynecologic malignancies are reviewed. After cervical cancer, there is a 9% excess risk of second cancers, of which only 5% could be attributed to radiation therapy. Most of the treatment-related malignancies after cervical or endometrial cancer are solid tumors occurring within the radiation field. Following both cervical and endometrial cancer, there is a small increased risk of leukemia associated with radiation therapy. In contrast, after ovarian cancer, there is significantly increased risk of leukemia related to treatment with alkylating agents, which varies by drug type and total dose. The cumulative risk of leukemia and preleukemia following single agent melphalan is 11.2% +/- 2.6% at ten years; the risk after cyclophosphamide is 5.4% +/- 3.2%. Overall, the risk of second malignancies following treatment of gynecologic cancers is small.\r"

Reliable QL measures are useful for rating the QL costs of cancer itself, for rating existing cancer treatments and therapies under clinical investigation, and for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to improve or prevent deterioration in QL status. Collaborative decision making by patients with their oncologists about anticipated therapy is enhanced by consideration of QL risks. Measures have broadened from assessing only performance status to include the domains of physical status (activity level, cognition, sexuality, fertility, and symptoms of pain, nausea, vomiting), psychological status (sense of well-being, depression, anxiety), social interaction (with sexual partner, family, friends, and co-workers), and economic status. Studies applying these concepts to patients who are survivors, in curative treatment, in palliative treatment, and terminally ill will be discussed.\r"

Dihydropyridine-Sepharose affinity matrix was synthesized by reaction of aminohexyl-Sepharose with an affinity analogue of nifedipine, dimethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(2-isothiocyanatophenyl)-3,5-pyridine-dicarbo xylate. Residual amine groups were then blocked by carbodiimide-catalyzed acetylation. [3H]Nitrendipine-binding activity in serum was specifically absorbed by the dihydropyridine-Sepharose affinity column. The bound antibody was eluted with diethylamine (pH 11.5) in 10% dioxane or with a low-affinity dihydropyridine ligand (diethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate), pH 7.4. Thirty-six milligrams of highly pure IgG antibody, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, was isolated from 50 ml hyperimmune sheep serum. The affinity-purified anti-dihydropyridine antibodies have been shown to have high affinity (Kd approximately 0.1 nM) and specificity for the 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers and, therefore, exhibit dihydropyridine-binding properties similar to the membrane receptor for the 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers. Immunoblot staining of an azidopine-bovine serum albumin conjugate with affinity-purified antidihydropyridine antibodies demonstrated that the anti-dihydropyridine antibodies recognize the 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers when covalently coupled to protein and, therefore, should be useful in the identification and purification of receptors covalently labelled with 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers.\r"

The women were allocated to four treatment groups: (1) oral cyclical combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and cyproterone acetate, (2) oral placebo, (3) percutaneous 17 beta-estradiol, supplemented by 200 mg oral progesterone during the second year, or (4) percutaneous placebo cream. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged in both hormone treatment groups, whereas the diastolic blood pressure tended to increase in both placebo groups. Plasma renin substrate increased during oral treatment with estradiol, but remained unchanged with percutaneous estradiol. No correlation was found between blood pressure and plasma renin substrate. During percutaneous administration of estradiol, the serum concentrations of estrone and estradiol continued to rise after 3 months and reached a plateau at 6 months of therapy. Serum estrone but not estradiol showed the same pattern during oral estradiol therapy. No further changes in any of the measured variables were observed in the women treated with percutaneous estradiol after addition of cyclical oral progesterone. We conclude that both oral and percutaneous treatment with estradiol may provide protection against the age-related increase in diastolic blood pressure observed in early postmenopausal women, and that the metabolic steady state is not attained until after 3 months of estradiol therapy.\r"

Elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) to greater than 480 dynes.sec.cm-5 (6 Wood units) is currently the principle hemodynamic contraindication to orthotopic cardiac transplantation. We performed serial two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic examinations and right heart catheterizations in 24 recipients (21 men, 14-58 years old) of orthotopic cardiac transplants to determine the time course of resolution of PHT and the concomitant remodeling of the donor right ventricle. Right and left heart filling pressures declined in parallel and reached the upper normal range at 2 weeks after the transplant procedure and remained unchanged at 1 year follow-up. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mm Hg) decreased from 38 +/- 9 preoperatively to 22 +/- 5 at 2 weeks and was 19 +/- 5 at 1 year after the transplantation procedure. At 1 year after surgery, PVR had decreased from 202 +/- 89 dynes.sec.cm-5 preoperatively to 99 +/- 36 dynes.sec.cm-5 (p less than .001), while cardiac output increased from 3.7 +/- 1.2 to 6.3 +/- 1.5 liters/min (p less than .001). Echocardiographic analysis showed that transplant recipients had an enlarged right ventricle on day 1 after surgery, and a volume overload contraction pattern and tricuspid regurgitation was present in the majority. This increase in right ventricular size was maintained at 1 year follow-up while the incidence of tricuspid regurgitation decreased. We conclude that there is rapid resolution of moderately elevated pulmonary arterial pressures after cardiac transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The occurrence of two or more major rejection episodes was associated (p less than .005) with the development of CAD. In two patients who died of CAD, coronary artery histology revealed subintimal inflammatory cellular infiltration in some lesions.

  ".W": "The renal excretion of an intravenous sodium load by ten heart-transplant recipients with (five patients) or without (five patients) moderate renal failure was compared with the results obtained in two matched control groups of ten kidney-transplant recipients with similar renal function. All patients were treated with prednisone and cyclosporine except, for the latter treatment, the kidney-transplant recipients without renal failure. A supplementary control group of five healthy subjects who did not receive any treatment was also included in the study. Fractional sodium and osmolal clearances were greater in heart-transplant than in kidney-transplant recipients for both the patients with and the patients without renal failure. These two parameters were also greater in heart-transplant recipients without renal failure than in healthy subjects. Free water clearance was smaller in the heart-transplant recipients than in the corresponding control patients. Fractional potassium clearance was not different from group to group. These results demonstrate that heart-transplant recipients excrete a greater fraction of the filtered sodium load than their controls. This increased fractional excretion of sodium cannot be attributed to the cyclosporine treatment or the moderate chronic renal failure which both have been taken into account in the comparisons. The unchanged blood pressure during the saline load and the high or normal plasma renin activity levels in the heart-transplant recipients make it also unlikely that the exaggerated natriuresis was the consequence of the higher blood pressure observed in these patients. The chronic cardiac denervation which is the consequence of surgery in these patients could play a role in the mechanism of the saline diuresis.\r"

Their limitation to patients presenting with either a macroscopic or a familial hematuria [Trachtman et al. 1984] bears the potential risk of missing the diagnosis of IgA-associated nephropathies (Berger disease and Henoch-Schonlein nephritis) which may manifest themselves by microscopic hematuria only. In order to reevaluate the association between biological IgA abnormalities and mesangial IgA deposits, iterative and concomitant determinations of IgA plasma levels, of IgA immune complexes and of IgA production by lymphocytes in vitro have been performed over a one-year period in two groups of hematuric children presenting with mesangial IgA deposits (14 cases) or not (13 cases). The incidence of positivity of each test was significantly higher in the former group of patients than in the latter. However, the best discrimination between both groups was observed when the three tests were repeated and/or considered together (97% vs 15% of positivity). In Berger disease and Henoch-Schonlein nephritis, IgA immune complexes were the only IgA abnormality more frequently detected in patients presenting with hematuria than in patients presenting with no hematuria at the time of testing. It is proposed to add IgA abnormalities to macroscopic or familial hematuria as indications for renal biopsies in isolated hematuria in childhood.\r"

  ".W": "Asymptomatic low molecular weight proteinuria, a disease recently reported by Suzuki et al. [1985], was found in five boys, two pairs of brothers and a sporadic patient aged 3 to 11 years. Their urinary proteins contained 56% to 67% of proteins of less than 40,000 mol wt, defined as low molecular weight proteins by Suzuki et al. [1985], an indication that proximal tubular reabsorption of these proteins is impaired in these patients. Their glomerular function tests and intravenous urography were normal. An attempt was made to identify urinary low molecular weight proteins in these patients, using Western blotting analysis of the protein bands separated by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All five proteins tested were detected: alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (mol wt 44,000), alpha 1-microglobulin (mol wt 33,000), retinol-binding protein (mol wt 21,000), lysozyme (mol wt 14,000), and beta 2-microglobulin (mol wt 11,800). The latter two proteins had been identified in the disease by other means by Suzuki et al. [1985], while the other three were newly identified. Light microscopic studies of renal biopsy specimens from these patients revealed in three of four patients tested focal global or segmental glomerular sclerosis with scattered intratubular casts and focal tubular atrophy. Immunofluorescence staining of the renal biopsy specimens for the five proteins revealed some in the lumens of the proximal tubules and in the casts in the distal or collecting tubules, while only retinol-binding protein was found in the epithelial cytoplasm of the proximal tubules.\r"

Both male and female sexual differentiation follow a timetable of events with predictable development of the gonads, internal genital ducts, and the external genitalia. Completed sexual maturation occurs during the pubertal years. Abnormalities of sexual differentiation may occur at any step along the way. The abnormalities may result in abnormal differentiation of the gonads, the internal genital ducts, or the external genitalia. The end result of these abnormalities produces predictable clinical syndromes. While many of these defects of sexual differentiation are evident at birth, others will not be identified until puberty at which time the patient may manifest aberrant external maturation or may remain sexually infantile. Genital ambiguity in a newborn represents a true medical emergency. Early and expedient diagnosis is essential to avoid life-threatening crises, to determine sex-of-rearing, to provide for appropriate immediate and long-term treatment, and to assure that the family is provided adequate genetic counseling. Medical and surgical treatment should begin during the birth hospitalization and the child should leave the hospital with his or her external genitalia concordant with sex-of-rearing. Finally, the emotional well-being of the family unit requires appropriate education and ongoing counseling.\r"

After 13 months, the animals were killed and each knee was examined for healing and arthritis. All of the fragments revascularized and healed. Poor reduction and PMMA extending to the articular surface universally led to arthritis.

Many physical examination maneuvers are available to further define the problem. Routine roentgenographic examination has been extended to include views specifically designed to demonstrate subtle bony changes. Complex radiographic contrast studies, especially computed arthrotomography, can confirm most anatomic lesions. When surgical treatment is under consideration, reexamination under anesthesia is increasingly being recognized as an important, essential procedure. Arthroscopy will effectively identify pathologic lesions within the joint and confirm uncertain diagnoses. An organized sequence of examinations is necessary for a thorough clinical investigation. After the investigation is complete, a classification of the shoulder instability can be made that relates to the results of treatment. The classification includes the elements of etiology, volition, direction of instability, and degree of instability.\r"

Selection of the optimum device for fixation is dependent on anatomic considerations, fracture characteristics, surgical exposure, and biomechanical features of fixation devices. Fixation objectives are evaluated in light of Neer's four segment classification. An extended deltopectoral approach with release of anterior deltoid distal insertion as well as the proximal pectoralis major raphe provides a wide exposure. The approach heals rapidly and allows rapid rehabilitation. The shoulder fracture fragments are adaptable to tension band wiring. With loss of bone stock, tension band wiring becomes increasingly important because compression or shearing forces can be expended in the tendinous insertion of the fragments. Fixation principles are applied according to specific fracture patterns. Whatever the choice of fixation method, a protracted and vigorous rehabilitation program is essential to achieve maximal functional recovery.\r"

Evaluation of a shoulder tumor has several areas in common with other musculoskeletal neoplasms, but the function of the rotator cuff is a key consideration in treatment goals. Thorough evaluation of patients with persistent pain requires not only routine radiography, but also radionuclide imaging, computed tomographic (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. As with all tumors, the importance of the biopsy cannot be overemphasized. A poorly executed biopsy can make limb salvage impossible. Surgical treatment of shoulder tumors will depend on age, type of tumor, extent of tumor, and neoplasm aggressiveness. Though in some instances limb sparing is not possible, a variety of reconstructive options exists that will salvage the distal limb and obtain satisfactory surgical margins.\r"

The prototype of the peroxisomal disorders is Zellweger syndrome. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, hyperpipecolic acidemia and Refsum disease are some of the other disease entities presently classified as peroxisomal disorders. Accurate methods of pre- and postnatal diagnosis are available.

Eleven healthy, unanaesthetized sheep were given either a single intravenous bolus infusion of U63,577A (Upjohn), a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, at a dose of 30 mg/kg (group 1, n = 6), or vehicle alone (group 2, n = 5). Animals were maintained in metabolic cages during the study, and received 150 ml of water/h and 7.5 mmol of sodium/h as Ringers lactate by intravenous infusion for 24 h before and during the study. During two 1 h control urine collections via bladder catheter, urine volume and sodium excretion closely paralleled these infusion rates. 2. In the first hour after injection of U63,577A, there were significant two- to three-fold increases in urine volume, urinary sodium excretion and fractional sodium excretion, compared with the control collections. During the subsequent 4 h, urine volume, urinary sodium excretion, and fractional sodium excretion fell to values significantly lower than in the control period. Creatinine clearance was reduced 1, 2 and 4 h post injection and returned to control values at 5 h. Urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 was significantly reduced compared with control values during the 5 h after injection of U63,577A. Excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha did not change. Plasma renin activity was significantly increased 1, 3 and 5 h after injection of U63,577A. Vehicle controls showed no change in any of the above parameters. 3. The results indicate that in healthy conscious sheep, sodium and water replete, U63,577A has a transient but significant diuretic and natriuretic effect, followed by sodium and water retention and increased plasma renin activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ouabain-resistant, frusemide-resistant rubidium influx (an index of passive potassium diffusion) was significantly lower in the luteal than the follicular phase. 3. In further studies in four of the eight subjects, the mean rate constant of the rubidium influx measurement was also lower in the luteal than in the follicular phase. 4. There were no changes in Na+-K+ co-transport, sodium pump activity or intracellular cation concentrations throughout the cycle. 5. There was a tenfold fall in the mean plasma 17 beta-oestradiol/progesterone ratio, as well as increases in plasma aldosterone concentration and renin activity between the mid-follicular and mid-luteal phases. 6. We conclude that changes in plasma oestrogen/progesterone ratio during the menstrual cycle may be associated with alterations in passive potassium diffusion.\r"

Normotensive animals showed a stable level of arterial pressure throughout each 24 h period with troughs occurring when they slept during the daytime. 4. Hypertensive animals given glucose had an enhanced diurnal rhythm of blood pressure compared with normotensive rats, with peaks occurring during periods of activity at night as well as troughs when they slept during the day. 5. Hypertensive rats given captopril retained this enhanced pressure variability, in spite of the fact that blood pressure was significantly lower and angiotensin II was suppressed. 6. These results suggest that angiotensin II is not involved in the increased blood pressure variability of renal hypertension and that some other irreversible mechanism is responsible.\r"

In contrast, 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 (the major urinary metabolite of thromboxane A2) and thromboxane B2 (the stable hydrolysis product of thromboxane A2) were not significantly different between the groups. 3. These data suggest that the ratio of the vasodilator prostanoids prostaglandin E and prostacyclin and the vasoconstrictor prostanoid thromboxane A2 is lower than in normal subjects, in alcoholics during withdrawal. This may be one causal factor for the higher incidence of hypertension observed in withdrawing alcoholics compared with control subjects.\r"

In many patients, careful monitoring of serum concentrations is required. Because of their chemical characteristics, aminoglycosides are given parenterally except in certain well-defined clinical situations such as bowel preparation prior to surgery. The drugs act by interfering with microbial protein synthesis and are uniformly bactericidal. Plasmid-mediated resistance remains a problem, particularly in the hospital environment. Aminoglycosides find their most frequent use in infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. The pharmacokinetics have been well characterized, and an appropriate dosage regimen can be selected to achieve peak bactericidal levels while maintaining trough concentrations low enough to minimize toxicity. Monitoring of serum aminoglycoside concentrations is essential in many types of patients, such as those having compromised renal function, those receiving a maximum dose of the drug, the obese, the elderly, and patients with cystic fibrosis. Close cooperation between the clinical laboratory and all groups involved in the patient's care is necessary to make maximum clinical use of drug monitoring information.\r"

Methods of analysis for these newer agents are primarily chromatographic types, such as gas-liquid or high-pressure liquid chromatography. Conspicuously absent from methods of analysis for these agents are the newer immunologic methods such as RIA or enzyme-linked assays. This deficiency in methodology is due to several factors. Cross-reactivity between metabolites and parent compounds is often a problem with antibody-based assays, and several of these agents have metabolites that reach concentrations equivalent to that of the parent drug. Several of the newer antiarrhythmics are structurally related not only to each other but also to older agents such as lidocaine. Overcoming this cross-reactivity would be necessary before these assays could be used in patients being converted from intravenous lidocaine to the newer oral preparations. With the development of monoclonal antibody techniques, the need for close therapeutic monitoring of several of the drugs, and the increased emphasis on restraining costs in the clinical laboratory, the newer immunologic methods may soon be introduced in the United States.\r"

Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring of NSAIDs other than salicylate is of little value to clinicians in their management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. On occasion, however, it may be helpful to monitor specific patients suspected of noncompliance by measuring plasma drug levels. Routine therapeutic drug monitoring of these NSAIDs must await further work on the refinement of quantitating clinical response and the possible relationship between free drug level and drug effects.\r"

In the present study of the irritant reaction caused by 1% SLS in 9 test animals, the 5 assessment parameters all showed values which, compared to control untested skin, increased progressively over the 3 days of application. In the assessment of skin irritancy, both evaporimetry and laser Doppler flowmetry have been shown to be useful non-invasive tools which can be quickly and reproducibly performed.\r"

A pulmonary simulator was tested to generate a wide range of inspiratory peak flow rates. Pressures and flow rates were examined in different sections of the system, using PEEP levels up to 15 mm Hg and different fresh gas flow rates. The circuit offers many advantages, particularly considering the low inspiratory pressure drop and the low fresh gas flow rates needed for optimal function.\r"

The patient probably developed a humoral antibody response to a lung-amiodarone complex with the amiodarone acting as a hapten which bound in vivo to the lung tissue. The subsequent antibody-antigen reaction stimulated a proliferation of pulmonary fibroblasts and probably enhanced the fibro-collagen deposition in the lung.\r"

The addition of amrinone further decreased significantly mean right atrial, pulmonary arterial, and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures and systemic vascular resistance, while heart rate rose. The response of the cardiac index was variable, increasing in seven and decreasing in three patients. Plasma renin activity rose significantly with dobutamine and further increased with amrinone. We conclude that in most patients with severe heart failure, amrinone, when combined with dobutamine, improves hemodynamics. The further increase in heart rate, variable effects on the cardiac index, and marked activation of the renin-angiotensin system suggest caution and potential limitations in the use of this combination.\r"

Eight of the sleep apnea subjects were judged to have disordered speech compared to three of the COPD group and one of the non-sleep apnea, non-COPD (normal) group. These results were statistically significant. This supports a clinical impression that speech disorder is more common in sleep apnea than expected. There may be common anatomic and physiologic disturbances present between the two conditions, and perhaps disordered speech is a sign of sleep apnea.\r"

It is clear from epidemiologic observations that diet is the principal factor in the cause of colorectal cancer in most people. Therefore, a significant reduction in incidence is possible in countries where the disease is common. The ingestion of excessive amounts of fat appears to be the major factor that promotes cancer development. Animal studies confirm this and have recently shown that the sources of fat vary in the degree of their promotional effect. Fiber is generally considered to inhibit cancer but it is now clear that only some types of fiber are effective. These include whole grain cereals, and fruit and vegetables containing large amounts of uronic acid. In addition to fiber, a number of micronutrients, chemicals, and drugs have been found to be effective inhibitors. It is clear that the basic information concerning dietary changes that can reduce colorectal cancer incidence in this country has been uncovered. Additional information is needed about specific details of dietary guidelines. These include identification of the best mixture of sources of fat and how to incorporate such a mixture in the diet. Substances in foods need to be identified that, when included in the diet, help to lower cancer risk. People at high risk may require an additional supplement of inhibitors. New epidemiologic studies and human intervention trials should provide the necessary information to design dietary guidelines that are more specific than current ones.\r"

Maximum resting pressure decreased significantly in both groups after surgery, although a small increase in maximum resting pressure was noticed after six months. A significant decrease in anal pressure was measured in both groups after one year. After one year, three patients in the dilatation group had minor degrees of incontinence compared to none in the nondilated group. In both groups three patients complained of recurrent symptoms of hemorrhoids. It is concluded that the combination of hemorrhoidectomy and anal dilatation does not improve cure rate compared to hemorrhoidectomy alone, but may increase the risk of continence disturbances.\r"

Patients receiving wheat fiber had a shorter postoperative hospital stay four days (three to five) vs. five days (three to six), median (range), P less than .01, and suffered less pain after defecation on the day of discharge from the hospital (P less than .05). Fecal leakage or soiling was seen less frequently with wheat fiber than in patients receiving the laxative regime (5/17 vs. 10/13, P less than .05).

The majority of diverticula are solitary and probably false and may be the result of the same degenerative process seen in the more common left-sided diverticulosis. A minority are true diverticula and may be of congenital origin. Cecal diverticulitis is clinically indistinguishable from acute appendicitis although patients with cecal diverticulitis tend to be older (average age, 40 years), have a longer duration of symptoms, and present less often with nausea and vomiting. In patients with previous appendectomy and in those with more indolent symptoms, barium enema may be helpful in making the diagnosis. If nonoperative treatment is chosen, careful follow-up with air contrast barium enema and colonoscopy should be carried out. The majority of patients require surgery and two types of cecal diverticulitis are encountered at laparotomy. The usual type, accounting for two thirds of cases, is easy to recognize, has an inflamed projection from the cecal wall, and is dealt with by a limited local diverticulectomy. Some authors advocate nonsurgical treatment for this first group of patients. Incidental appendectomy is advocated to avoid confusion should symptoms occur postoperatively. The hidden variant presents as a large, indurated phlegmon and is difficult to distinguish from a perforated cecal carcinoma.

  ".W": "The pancreatic duct or at least parts of this structure can be demonstrated today by sonography in 75-85% of all persons examined. In 84 persons we have now measured the caliber of the sonographically visualized pancreatic duct in the region of the proximal body of the pancreas with special attention to dependence on age. The diameter of Wirsung's duct ranged from 1 to 3 mm (mean 1.9 mm) and increased significantly from the fifth decade of life onwards. After intravenous injection of the hormone secretin, healthy persons usually show a distinct duct enlargement, which also depends on age. Nine persons aged 19 through 35 (median 28) years showed a dilatation of the main pancreatic duct by about 110% following secretion injection. Nine further probands, 50-74 (median 58) years old, had a dilatation of about 70%. Eighteen patients with confirmed chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic duct diameter not exceeding 4 mm generally showed no duct enlargement after secretin stimulation. We believe that periductal fibrosis, which is common in chronic pancreatitis, is the most important reason for these results. The use of the sonographic secretin test in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "Local septic complications in acute pancreatitis need to be exactly characterized and defined in order to develop improved concepts for their prevention, early diagnosis, and therapy. While up to now all local septic complications have been termed abscesses, the present study for the first time delineates the morphologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria needed to distinguish between two separate clinical entities: the infected necrosis (IN) and the pancreatic abscess (PA). IN is defined as a diffuse bacterial inflammation of necrotic pancreatic and peripancreatic tissue, but without any significant pus collections. On the other hand, the morphologic substrate of PA is a localized collection of pus surrounded by a more or less distinct capsula. IN becomes clinically evident during the early phase of acute pancreatitis (AP). The patients with IN present both the signs of sepsis and the laboratory findings of AP. Thus in these patients the most fulminant course of AP is observed; 51.8% and 35.7% of them have pulmonary or renal insufficiency, respectively. The mortality of the patients with IN is high and amounts to 32.1%. Pancreatic abscess, on the other hand, does not develop before the fifth week after onset of symptoms and after subsidence of the acute phase of pancreatitis. In these patients laboratory signs of AP-like amylasemia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, and rise of LDH are rarely observed. Corresponding to the lack of pathophysiologic effects of AP per se, pulmonary and renal insufficiencies occur in only 33.3% and 16.7%, respectively, and mortality in these patients is 22.2%. While an abscess may readily be identified by computed tomography, the differentiation between IN and non-IN can be very difficult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective study was conducted to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of scintigraphy, ultrasound, and CT scanning in conjunction with biochemical tests in the detection of liver neoplasia. Sixty-three patients with metastatic liver disease and 45 patients with nonmalignant liver disease received a total of 46 liver/spleen scans, 61 ultrasounds, and 49 CT scans. The sensitivities of liver/spleen scan, ultrasound, and CT scan were 72, 73, and 81%, respectively; the specificities were 86, 94, and 83%, respectively; and, the accuracies were 78, 84, and 82%, respectively. No statistically significant difference in specificity, sensitivity, or accuracy was seen between the three imaging studies. The serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly more accurate than total bilirubin and SGOT in detecting liver metastasis. However, 19 and 13% of the malignant and nonmalignant groups, respectively, had normal biochemical tests. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the imaging studies in the presence of an abnormal alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, or total bilirubin were not significantly different than in the presence of normal biochemical tests. These results suggest that other factors such as cost, reproducibility, and availability of skilled interpreters should be considered in the selection of imaging studies for the detection of neoplastic liver disease.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the pathogenesis of impaired glucose tolerance in patients with cirrhosis, several factors possibly affecting carbohydrate metabolism were studied in 12 cirrhotic patients with different blood glucose responses to an oral glucose tolerance test. Glucose levels, 120 min after the load, were inversely and significantly related to insulin sensitivity, measured by means of the euglycemic \"glucose clamp\" technique (r = -0.746). Basal and glucose-induced insulin secretion (insulin and C-peptide levels) only slightly correlated with glucose tolerance, which was not related to functional liver cell mass (galactose elimination), portal-systemic shunting (degree of varices at endoscopy), or maximal glucose-independent insulin secretion (peak C-peptide levels after a glucagon test). Multiple regression analysis identified insulin sensitivity and liver cell mass as the independent variables able to explain most of the variance of 120-min blood glucose (about 84%), and both of them contributed considerably to the regression. While reduced insulin sensitivity is probably the main cause of impaired glucose tolerance, the reduced hepatocellular mass only appears to modulate the degree, and therefore the clinical relevance, of this defect.\r"

In the isolated acini, pirenzepine did not have any significant effect on cholecystokinin-induced amylase release but caused an inhibition of amylase secretion initiated by secretin and shifted the dose-response curve for amylase secretion to the right. In the isolated perfused pancreas stimulated with 100 pM cholecystokinin octapeptide, addition of 10 microM pirenzepine before as well as after 20 min of perfusion significantly inhibited pancreatic juice flow but not enzyme output. In contrast, pirenzepine caused an inhibition of secretin-stimulated enzyme secretion, but not pancreatic juice flow. The stimulatory effect of both cholecystokinin octapeptide and secretin on insulin secretion was also inhibited by pirenzepine. The present data indicate that pirenzepine may have an influence on pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function by inhibiting endogenous cholinergic activity of the pancreas when a large dose is given.\r"

Not only is it one of the two most common congenital heart diseases and the most common valve disorder diagnosed in the United States, but it is also prevalent throughout the world. Mitral valve prolapse may be associated with a variety of other conditions or diseases. Diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse should be made on clinical grounds and, if necessary, supported by echocardiography. The majority of patients with mitral valve prolapse suffer no serious sequelae. However, major complications such as disabling angina-like chest pains, progressive mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, thromboembolism, serious arrhythmias, and sudden death may occur. Unless these serious complications occur, most of the patients with mitral valve prolapse need no treatment other than reassurance, including those with atypical chest pain or palpitation unconfirmed by objective data. Therapy with a beta-blocker for disabling chest pain and/or arrhythmias and antiplatelet therapy for cerebral embolic events may be indicated. In occasional patients with significant mitral regurgitation surgery may be necessary.\r"

BSS 4.2 g given over 3 1/2 hours was shown to reduce the number of stools passed and favorably alter subjective symptoms in patients with traveler's diarrhea. BSS has also been shown to have beneficial effects on chronic infantile diarrhea. A small but discernible effect has been shown on selected symptoms associated with Norwalk virus-induced gastroenteritis. A liquid preparation, in a dose of 60 ml qid (4.2 g/d), was 62 percent effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea during a three-week period of risk and a tablet formulation (BSS 600 mg qid) was 76 percent effective in preventing experimentally induced enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhea in volunteers. A tablet formulation (2.1 g/d) was recently shown to be 65 percent effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea during a three-week clinical trial in Mexico. Preliminary evidence suggests that the salicylate moiety exerts antisecretory effects in patients with diarrhea and the bismuth and intestinal hydrolysis products of BSS have direct antimicrobial effects.\r"

Therapy of the disease is principally aimed at controlling convulsions with magnesium sulfate and controlling hypertension with the antihypertensive agent hydralazine. Because development of the disease depends on the presence of trophoblastic tissue, the only true cure for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is removal of the trophoblast through delivery of the infant. The timing and type of delivery is dependent on the severity of the disease and gestational age of the infant.\r"

The maternal platelet count should be monitored carefully during pregnancy and treated according to the prior information. In addition, platelet antibodies may assist in predicting more effectively the potentially affected fetuses. In these cases, deliveries by cesarean section should be considered. If a fetal scalp platelet count is possible at the onset of labor, this should be performed, and if the count is less than 50,000 per mm3, the fetus should be delivered by immediate cesarean section. Clearly, it is necessary to have facilities available for immediate cesarean section prior to performing the platelet count. The use of steroid therapy near term appears to have a beneficial effect on the neonatal platelet count and should be strongly considered. Further information relating to the neonatal effects of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may indicate this as a preferential prophylactic form of fetal therapy that may be available prior to delivery.\r"
