The eventual incidence of squint was the same in both groups (approximately 24%). The last known visual acuity of the two groups was not significantly different either. Therefore there is no indication to screen infants with a view to preventing squint/amblyopia by optical correction of hypermetropia. If, however, the children allocated treatment are divided into two subgroups--those who wore glasses consistently and those who probably or certainly did not do so--the incidence of squint was the same, but the last known acuities of those who consistently wore glasses may be better than those who did not do so. This suggests that it may yet prove possible to prevent severe amblyopia.\r"

Five SLE patients had recurrent episcleritis, two CCLE patients had lower tarsal plaques, and two further CCLE patients had erosion of the lower lid margins associated with conjunctival scarring and symblepharon. This association has not previously been reported. There was an unexpectedly high incidence of deposition of immunoreactants in a linear pattern at the basement membrane zone in normal bulbar conjunctiva, which occurred in both SLE (42%) and CCLE (50%). The significance of these findings is discussed. We believe surface ocular problems in lupus erythematosus to be under-reported and that direct immunofluorescence of bulbar conjunctival biopsy might be helpful in diagnosis.\r"

DESIGN--Observational study of the feasibility and safety of coronary arteriography in a district general hospital and analysis of its diagnostic accuracy by prospective within patient comparison of the video recordings with cinearteriograms obtained in a catheter laboratory. SETTING--Radiology department of a district general hospital and the catheter laboratory of a cardiological referral centre. SUBJECTS--50 Patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with streptokinase who underwent coronary arteriography in a district general hospital three (two to five) days after admission. 45 Of these patients had repeat coronary arteriography after four (three to seven) days in the catheter laboratory of a cardiological referral centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Incidence of complications associated with catheterisation and the sensitivity and specificity of video recordings in the district general hospital (judged by two experienced observers) for identifying the location and severity of coronary stenoses. RESULTS--Coronary arteriograms recorded on videotape in the district general hospital were obtained in 47 cases and apart from one episode of ventricular fibrilation (treated successfully by cardioversion) there were no complications of the procedure. 45 Patients were transferred for investigation in the catheter laboratory, providing 45 paired coronary arteriograms recorded on videotape and cine film. The specificity of the video recordings for identifying the location and severity of coronary stenoses was over 90%. Sensitivity, however, was lower and for one observer fell below 40% for lesions in the circumflex artery. A cardiothoracic surgeon judged that only nine of the 47 video recordings were adequate for assessing revascularisation requirements. CONCLUSIONS--Coronary arteriography in the radiology department of a district general hospital is safe and feasible. Nevertheless, the quality of image with conventional fluoroscopy and video film is inadequate and will need to be improved before coronary arteriography in this setting can be recommended.\r"

The anaemia was normochromic normocytic in 60% and hypochromic normocytic in 30% of those with anaemia of chronic disease (ACD). Iron deficiency was present in 55% and the anaemia was hypochromic microcytic in 54% and hypochromic normocytic or normochromic normocytic in 21%. Iron absorption was found to be higher in iron deficient patients. In ACD patients, iron absorption correlated inversely with ESR and CRP. For the detection of iron deficiency among RA patients with ACD, the MCV showed the highest specificity (90%) and predictive value (87%). Serum ferritin was the most sensitive (82%) and valid (86%) test. Combination of MCV, ferritin and transferrin resulted in 100% validity. It was concluded that iron deficiency can be detected accurately without bone marrow aspiration using combinations of blood parameters.\r"

This algorithm has been created as an easy to use flow diagram based on two objective laboratory measures (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), one subjective and two semi-objective clinical measures (morning stiffness, synovitis score and Ritchie articular index). Results of six clinical markers and seven laboratory markers of disease activity on a cohort of 371 rheumatoid patients have been used to evaluate the algorithm and compare it with a previously described index of disease activity (Mallya-Mace index). Principal component analysis validates its ability to measure disease activity. Sensitivity is described by the distribution of patients between the two index scores. Change in index score by patients over a 6-month period indicates reversibility. The Stoke index demonstrates greater sensitivity and reversibility than the Mallya-Mace index. These findings indicate that the algorithm described provides a useful index of global disease activity for use in the assessment of rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Laboratory variables of disease activity showed a significant improvement in haemoglobin and ESR in the methotrexate group. Subsequently, the patients were followed for up to 3 years. After one year, more than half of the patients in both groups had discontinued therapy due to inefficacy or adverse events. Adverse effects were more frequent in the patients treated with methotrexate, but withdrawal rates were similar in both groups.

We have previously shown that pressure-induced venous distension leads to cutaneous hypoxia which is caused by arteriolar vasoconstriction in response to a spinal reflex. The prolonged cutaneous hypoxia which is thus a consequence of sustained elevation of venous pressure is an important factor in the development of gravitational ulcers. It is postulated that the increased incidence of leg ulcers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is the result of impairment of the efficiency of the venous muscle pump by reduced ankle mobility. Conversely, the elevation of venous blood pressure in patients with venous insufficiency may lead to arthropathy in the ankle. The hypothesis is presented that prolonged elevation of venous blood pressure causes injury to both the ankle joint and veins leading to chronic reciprocal damage to both. This explains the frequent association between arthropathy of the ankle and venous leg ulcers.\r"

  ".W": "The acute effects of smoking a single cigarette on peripheral blood flow were investigated by laser-Doppler flowmetry in nine patients with Raynaud's phenomenon and 12 normal controls. In regular smokers, a marked fall in finger blood flow was demonstrated, but this was not present in non- or irregular smokers. In addition, no effect on capillary blood flow was found. There was no difference between subjects with and without Raynaud's phenomenon. In five normal, non-smoking volunteers, 2.4 g of aspirin for 3 days resulted in a similar fall in blood flow due to a single cigarette. These results suggest that regular smoking sensitizes the peripheral vasculature to the vasoconstricting effects of the next cigarette, and that at least part of this sensitization is mediated by the inhibition of endothelial prostacyclin synthesis. Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, either primary or secondary, are no more sensitive than normal subjects, but should nevertheless avoid cigarette smoking.\r"

It is only relatively recently that the mechanical properties of the wall of the colon have been examined. The tensile strength and elasticity of the colon decline with age and this is the most marked in the left colon which is the narrowest and thickest part. This review discusses the case that the mechanical properties of the bowel wall are key factors in the development of diverticular disease. The potential role of high fibre diets in reducing the pressure changes which may stress the colon wall in this disease is also considered.\r"

Evidence for this is accumulating from both clinical studies and from studies in laboratory animals. Necrotizing fasciitis (rapid spread over 24 h) can be caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci, sometimes with Staphylococcus aureus, or by mixed infections of aerobes and anaerobes, often of gut origin. Animal studies provide good evidence that S. aureus can potentiate the beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection in necrotizing fasciitis. There is also evidence that mixtures of aerobes and anaerobes can act synergistically, but animal models for necrotizing fasciitis have not been developed. Anaerobic cellulitis (variable rate of spread from hours to days) can be caused by mixed aerobes and anaerobes or by mixed clostridia. Animal studies provide good evidence for synergy in the former. Meleney's synergistic postoperative gangrene (slow spread over weeks) may be cutaneous amoebiasis: the animal model of Brewer and Meleney relates to the more rapid infections of anaerobic cellulitis.\r"

Currently, thallium subtraction scintigraphy and ultrasonography are the techniques used most frequently. This paper examines prospectively the accuracy and value of these techniques in a group of 71 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. When considering all glands, thallium scanning produced a sensitivity of 46.6 per cent with a specificity of 91.5 per cent, compared with a sensitivity of only 21.4 per cent and specificity of 94.5 per cent for ultrasonography. Accuracy rates, for all glands, were 80 per cent and 75.7 per cent respectively. Both localization procedures were consistently ineffective in localizing adenomas weighing less than 500 mg, over 80 per cent of which went undetected by both scanning modalities. While both scans produced satisfactory results in localizing adenomas weighing more than 1 g, these adenomas should not represent a challenge to an experienced endocrine surgeon and, therefore, neither localization is recommended before first neck exploration.\r"

In 30 premedicated patients, divided at random into three groups, anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg.kg-1 immediately followed by an alfentanil infusion 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 as a loading dose which was decreased after ten minutes to a maintenance dose of 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1. Vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg.kg-1 was used as the muscle relaxant. After induction of anaesthesia a propofol infusion 2 mg.kg-1.hr-1 was started in group A, 3 mg.kg-1.hr-1 in group B and 4 mg.kg-1 hr-1 in group C. At signs of light anaesthesia supplementary bolus doses of 20 mg propofol and 1 mg alfentanil were given. The patients' lungs were ventilated with air-oxygen (FIO2 0.35). The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures showed no statistical significant differences between the three groups. A significant (P less than 0.01) decrease of the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures was present after induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation. Recovery was uneventful in all but one patient, who had ventilatory depression that responded to naloxone (0.2 mg IV). Awareness did not occur in any patient. The only difference between the three groups was the higher number of supplementary bolus doses of propofol and alfentanil needed in group A (P less than 0.01). In total intravenous anaesthesia propofol 3 and 4 mg.kg-1.hr-1 as a maintenance dose combined with a two-step fixed-rate alfentanil infusion provided smooth anaesthesia and uneventful rapid recovery.\r"

Patients received either succinylcholine 1.5 mg.kg-1 (Groups I and II) after d-tubocurarine 0.05 mg.kg-1 four minutes earlier, or vecuronium (Groups III and IV) in an initial dose of 0.01 mg.kg-1 followed four minutes later by 0.1 mg.kg-1. In Groups I and III an apnoeic delay of one minute was allowed before intubation whereas in Groups II and IV the delay was 90 sec. There was no significant difference in intubating conditions between Groups I and IV. Intubating conditions in Group III (vecuronium-delay of one minute) were statistically worse than in any of the three other groups. A delay of 90 sec after succinylcholine improved intubating conditions in male patients. Considering that intubating conditions obtained after 90 sec in patients given a priming sequence with vecuronium (Group IV) were not different from those obtained 60 sec after succinylcholine (Group I), the authors conclude that vecuronium is an acceptable alternative for rapid tracheal intubation. In the doses used in this study, intubating conditions 60 sec after vecuronium were unacceptable for rapid induction of anaesthesia.\r"

Patients were included in the study if they had undergone CABG only, and had not received treatment for ventricular arrhythmias before coming off cardiopulmonary bypass. A total of 83 patients were studied and were randomly allocated to 43 in the placebo control group and 40 in the lidocaine-treated group. The results showed that 67 per cent of patients in the placebo group and 33 per cent of patients in the lidocaine treated group had ventricular arrhythmias (P less than 0.005). There was also a significant reduction in ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in the lidocaine treated group (P less than 0.01).

In no case was a total absence of M2 noted. The fluorescence pattern was fine but homogeneously linear along the GBM in 12 cases, intensity varying from +-++, as compared with for the control specimen GBM. A faint, broken line of stain, intensity+, was observed in biopsy specimens of two patients, one of whom had family members with progressive hereditary nephritis, type Alport's syndrome. Clinical presentation was dominated by hematuria (10/14 patients) but also included three patients with isolated proteinuria. Two patients had nephrotic range proteinuria. Other than the GBM changes, histological findings were sparse, with either no abnormalities or only slight mesangial increase in most. One case of focal segmental sclerosis and hyalinosis was also found. The findings from this study suggest that the abnormally thin GBM does not lack the GP epitope, but it may be reduced.\r"

The measurements of glomerular basement membrane taken from electron micrographs (magnification x 12,500) were analyzed using an interactive image analysis system assembled around an INTEL 10 microcomputer, with a high resolution touch sensitive screen as the interactive peripheral. Calculation was done by printing on an electron micrograph a grating replica (21,600 lines/cm), with the same magnification as the electron micrographs of the glomeruli and calibrating the arithmetic (AM) and harmonic (HM) mean for each case. Comparing the results of TBMD cases (AM 129-202 nm; HM 128-213 nm) with those of the control group consisting of 5 cases of \"minimal change nephrotic syndrome\" (AM 287-317 nm; HM 300-333 nm) it was found that GBM in TBMD is remarkably thin. The thinning was caused mainly by the decreased width of the lamina densa (TBMD group: 71.4-147.0 nm; HM 72.4-154.4 nm in comparison with the control group: AM 174.4-235.5 nm; HM 184.2-249.6 nm). This finding allows us to differentiate thin basement membrane disease from other glomerulopathies presenting primarily with isolated or recurrent hematuria.\r"

In 42 patients who were followed at an outpatient clinic, albumin/creatinine ratio (Ualb/Ucreat: mg/mmol) of untimed urine obtained from the same subjects repetitively was employed as an index of UAE. In 6 hospitalized patients, albumin excretion rate (AER) (micrograms/min) of 24-h-collected urine was determined. When followed without dipyridamole for 10.8 (the mean) months (N = 27, outpatients), the mean Ualb/Ucreat increased from 8.1 to 20.5. Of these, 11 patients with Ualb/Ucreat greater than 1.0 at the end of the observation period subsequently received dipyridamole for 4.2 months, and the ratio decreased from 49.0 to 7.3. When treated with dipyridamole for 9.0 months without a pre-treatment observation period (N = 15, outpatients), the ratio decreased from 9.8 to 5.6. AER of hospitalized patients who received dipyridamole for 10.0 days reduced from 68.0 to 21.9. All of these changes were statistically significant. Urinary beta 2 MG, blood pressure, serum creatinine and glycemic control were unaffected by the dipyridamole treatment. We conclude that dipyridamole reduces UAE in diabetic patients with subclinical level of albuminuria.\r"

His serum erythropoietin maintained at a constant level during polycythemia was higher than it was before the appearance of renal ischemia, so he was kept in a polycythemic state. Whether decreasing proteinuria can improve renal ischemia requires future study. We must observe the patient for the occurrence of thromboembolism. Renal ischemia possibly induced by nephrotic syndrome is likely to cause secondary polycythemia.\r"

This case merits reporting because of the youth of the patient (age 19), the uniqueness of the prosthetic component, and the long-term follow-up observation. The patient had posttraumatic bony ankylosis of the elbow with a painful supracondylar pseudoarthrosis and loss of bone from the proximal metaphysis. A custom humeral endoprosthesis was inserted, and anatomic reconstitution of the sigmoid notch of the ulna was provided. Reasonably good, painless, stable motion was achieved, which has not deteriorated in the subsequent 21 years of observation. The clinical significance of this case is that in a nonweight-bearing hinged joint, endoprosthesis arthroplasty can be an excellent option when given the proper indications and carried out with meticulous planning.\r"

The management of these problems must be understood in light of current social trends that influence patient management. Workers' compensation is one of these continually developing trends. This article describes the historical aspects of compensation and bodily injury or loss occurring in the work place. Changes in workers' attitudes during the development of workers' compensation have been observed since the turn of the century. The influence of the legal system in this regard is also noteworthy. The modern surgeon is faced with these confounding influences when treating a patient with a work-related injury or cumulative trauma disorder.\r"

General considerations are discussed that will help the reader analyze clinical series focused on this problem. Theoretical advantages and disadvantages of both cemented and cementless fixation are also discussed along with supporting data. The major reports of large series of cases pertinent to this issue suggest that results of cemented primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) are excellent in the short run but deteriorate with time. This is in contrast to the results of uncemented primary THAs, which are not only satisfactory in the short run but tend to improve with the passage of time. Uncemented primary THAs are a rational treatment in the young, active male. In revision surgery, cemented techniques are unsatisfactory. Uncemented techniques show promise but as yet remain unproven.\r"

Ion movement from the capillary to the matrix is by diffusion, and efflux appears to be controlled by a concentration-dependent binding mechanism in the extravascular space of bone. The resistance vessels of bone are regulated by local, neural, and humoral factors. Fractures of long bone provoke a decrease in blood flow followed by a large increase in blood flow driven by metabolic demand. Fractures heal by coordinated formation of new bone, which is a combination of interstitial and surface remodeling. Age affects bone remodeling. Fixation of an experimental fracture may modify blood flow as well as bone remodeling. Fluid fluxes in bone may produce streaming potentials that in turn stimulate the osteoblasts to form new bone.\r"

These partial lesions are infrequently demonstrated with arthrography or bursography. Although structural variations in cuff integrity can be demonstrated with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, precise definition of partial tears is difficult. The exact location and extent of incomplete tears can be documented with shoulder arthroscopy. Anterior acromioplasty, either open or arthroscopic, is indicated for the treatment of chronic mechanical impingement refractory to conservative management. When a sizable partial defect is identified at open surgery, the degenerated tissue is excised and the tendon is reattached to bone or repaired with side-to-side suture. Arthroscopic treatment consists of debridement of the torn cuff margins, followed by arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD). When the incomplete tear in an active individual involves more than one-half the cuff thickness, arthroscopic and open techniques can be combined. Twenty partial-thickness tears were encountered among 130 patients who had ASD for chronic impingement. Fifteen had a satisfactory result, but five required additional surgery. A system of grading partial-thickness tears based on location, depth, and area is presented in an effort to standardize the observations of various investigators and to permit comparison of the results of arthroscopic treatment.\r"

If the tear is large or if active lateral rotation is absent, tomoarthrography using air should be performed in the frontal and sagittal planes. If an anteromedial dislocation of the long head of the biceps or a tear of the subcapularis is suspected, computed tomoarthrography (CTA) is indicated. CTA shows the major part of the anterior cuff tendons.

Nevertheless, if a complication arises, it must be correctly managed in order to salvage shoulder function.\r"

The main industrial processes are fabrication of semiconductor wafers, printed circuit boards, the assembly of semiconductor devices, printed circuit boards and the final electronic products. The process carry the risk of various work hazards, among them dermatological hazards. These include exposure to irritants and allergens during common operations such as soldering, cleaning operations, materials handling, procedures for control of static electricity and low humidity in the work environment. Even the use of protective clothing may be associated with the risk of dermatitis. In spite of the numerous dermatological hazards, the risk for work-related skin disorders among electronics workers appears to be low when compared to other industries. However, the vast size of the electronics workforce will contribute to large numbers of workers with occupational dermatoses. Occupational health personnel responsible for factories in the electronics industry should therefore be aware of the cutaneous hazards present, and how these may lead to work-related dermatoses.\r"

Patients showed a mild basal pulmonary artery hypertension. During INPV, no changes in the mean values of HR (from 79 +/- 20 to 80 +/- 18 beats per minute), systolic BP (141 +/- 19 to 139 +/- 16 mm Hg), CO (5.2 +/- 0.8 to 5.1 +/- 1.3 L/min), mean PAP (23.8 +/- 3.8 to 23.9 +/- 4.4 mm Hg), RAP (4.3 +/- 2.6 to 5.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg), PWP (10.3 +/- 4.5 to 9.4 +/- 2.9 mm Hg), TPR (369 +/- 76 to 392 +/- 124 dynes.s.cm-5), and PVR (199 +/- 51 to 233 +/- 94 dynes.s.cm-5) were observed. Direct systemic BP monitoring could be performed in six patients. During INPV, three patients showed \"pulsus paradoxus,\" as assessed by an inspiratory fall in systolic BP of 11, 13, and 20 mm Hg, respectively.

Based on CT criteria for subcarinal lymphadenopathy, 37 true-positive and 124 true-negative cases of subcarinal adenopathy were found in 161 patients. Evaluation of density in the subcarinal area on the routine posteroanterior (PA) chest roentgenograms in these patients demonstrated a sensitivity of 72 percent and specificity of 96 percent for the detection of adenopathy when compared with established CT criteria. False-positive and false-negative appraisals of central mediastinal density on routine roentgenograms appear to be due to the super-imposition of other masses, bullae, or lack of appropriate roentgenographic contrast. The accuracy of predicting the presence or absence of subcarinal adenopathy from routine chest roentgenograms suggests that this observation is clinically useful and should be routinely evaluated.\r"

One patient used all three modes before requiring full-time T-IPPV. Mean (+/- SD) FVC and rebreathe PCO2 at the outset of assisted ventilation were 0.62 +/- 0.20 L and 47.4 +/- 7.5 mm Hg, respectively. Clinical features were divided between symptoms suggesting respiratory muscle fatigue and sleep-related disordered breathing. We found that, while useful in early respiratory insufficiency, BV is associated with recurrent aspiration. In our experience, N-IPPV offers the safest and most convenient form of noninvasive ventilation. When the VC has decreased to about 300 ml, most patients will require full-time ventilation; T-IPPV is advised to provide airway access to suction secretions.\r"

These results confirm that ketanserin acts as a mild bronchodilator in patients with COPD and demonstrate that the inhaled route has no advantage over the intravenous route in terms of effectiveness.

Clinical outcome was as follows: mean duration of treatment, 4.5 +/- 2.3 days for the group with CPAP and 7.3 +/- 3.7 days for the intubated group (p = 0.0003); mean number of days spent in intensive care, 5.3 +/- 2.9 days and 9.5 +/- 4.4 days, respectively (p = less than 0.0001); mean period of hospitalization, 8.4 +/- 7.1 days and 14.6 +/- 8.6 days, respectively (p = 0.0019); and patients developing complications: 28 percent (10/36) and 73 percent (24/33), respectively. Infections caused the difference in complications, primarily pneumonias, which occurred in 14 percent (5/36) of the group with CPAP but in 48 percent (16/33) of the intubated group. We conclude that treatment with a CPAP mask combined with regional analgesia can shorten and simplify treatment in these patients, mainly through a decreased infection rate, when compared with intubation and mechanical ventilation, and we recommend this treatment in patients similar to our sample.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term CVC allows patients with a variety of diseases to lead a more normal and pain-free life. The use of these catheters has become commonplace in most hospitals, and the physician caring for patients in the ICU will be caring for increasing numbers of patients with an indwelling long-term CVC. Infections of these catheters can be manifested in many different ways: tunnel infections, exit site infections, catheter-related bacteremia, and septic thrombophlebitis. The overwhelming majority of these infections are caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, but physicians should be aware of the wide variety of organisms that can infect the long-term CVC. The diagnosis of long-term CVC sepsis can be difficult, but the use of quantitative blood cultures for catheters left in place and the Maki method for culturing those catheters that are removed will aid physicians in their quest for diagnostic certainty. The great majority of catheter infections will resolve with antibiotic therapy alone without the need for catheter removal, but there are important exceptions to this general rule. Tunnel infections and fungal long-term CVC infections often require catheter removal for their resolution; septic thrombophlebitis and CR-SCVT require the addition of anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to antibiotic regimens for resolution of the infection, and surgical debridement may be warranted if these modalities fail to resolve the infection.\r"

Since publication in The Lancet, the original report has become a reference work for every paper which deals with thrombolysis. In addition to GISSI's scientific value, these studies applied formal research to routine clinical practice outside of referral centers. Nearly all Italian CCUs took part in the GISSI projects, so that the results provide a profile of the patient who seeks care for acute MI in Italy. This wide data base allowed GISSI investigators to look into some relevant clinical events, eg, primary ventricular fibrillation, stroke, and in-hospital reinfarction. The GISSI-2 trial followed the GISSI-1 philosophy. The package of treatments recommended after extensive discussion with all the investigators (beta-blocker, aspirin, nitrates) was widely adopted. Now, only five years after the start of the GISSI-1, the overall mortality of Italian patients with acute MI has decreased from 13.0 percent to about 9 percent, and the number of patients with acute MI arriving in hospital within 1 h of the onset of symptoms has increased 50 percent. It is the wish of the GISSI investigators that this approach to treating acute MI will be regarded and acknowledged as their major contribution to the problem.\r"

In the subset of patients with recent rest angina, both angiographic and angioscopic studies have suggested that coronary artery thrombus is often present and serves as a predictor of subsequent adverse clinical events, including recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, the need for urgent coronary revascularization, and death. Studies of thrombolytic therapy in small populations of patients with unstable angina suggest it may lyse coronary thrombus, raise the ischemic threshold, and possibly have a favorable influence on clinical outcome. Large multicenter trials of patients with unstable angina and non-Q-wave infarction have been designed to answer several questions: Will rt-PA produce improvement in angiographically determined coronary arterial stenoses? Is rt-PA superior to conventional therapy? Is there a need for routine angiography, followed by revascularization, in suitable patients? Until these questions are answered, the role of thrombolytic therapy in patients with unstable angina remains speculative.\r"

A case of bleeding ileostomy varices is presented. The English-language medical literature since 1962 is reviewed and an additional 71 cases of stomal variceal bleeding are identified. Treatment options evaluated include stomal manipulation, variceal ligation, sclerotherapy, beta blockade, and surgical shunting. The incidence of rebleeding, requirement for additional procedures, and survival with the various options are compared. Although stomal manipulation was the most commonly performed procedure, portosystemic shunting had the lowest incidence of both rebleeding and need for additional procedures (4 percent each) and provided the longest mean postoperative survival (50 months). The authors conclude that portosystemic shunting is the treatment of choice in patients with bleeding from stomal varices who are good surgical candidates.\r"

The traditional management of this disease has been surgery alone, but advances in adjuvant therapy offer potential for improvement of local control, disease-free survival, and survival. In the last two decades, many multicenter randomized trials of adjuvant preoperative and postoperative radiation therapy for rectal carcinoma have been reported. The design and results of these trials are critically reviewed. Results from preoperative trials have been conflicting, reflecting the heterogeneity of the trial designs. Large postoperative adjuvant trials have been reported recently. The combined analysis of local recurrence data from the mature, published trials indicates that radiation therapy results in improved local control (P = 0.02), an important concern in rectal carcinoma as local recurrences present vexing and painful clinical problems often refractory to conventional management. These trials also have shown that radiation therapy can contribute to improved survival in the combined modality setting. Improvements in the clinical outcome of rectal cancer should be possible with appropriate adjuvant therapy. The success of combined modality adjuvant therapy for rectal carcinoma may serve as a model to aid in the design of therapeutic regimens for other solid tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable confusion over terminology for classifying basic types of research design in family medicine stems from the rich variety of substantive topics studied by family medicine researchers, differences in research terminology among the disciplines that family medicine research draws from, and lack of uniform research design terminology within these disciplines themselves. Many research design textbooks themselves fail to specify the dimensions on which research designs are classified or the logic underlying the classification systems proposed. This paper describes a typology based on three dimensions that may be used to characterize the basic design qualities of any study. These dimensions are: 1) the nature of the research objective (exploratory, descriptive, or analytic); 2) the time frame under investigation (retrospective, cross-sectional, or prospective); and 3) whether the investigator intervenes in the events under study (observational or interventional). This three-dimensional typology may be helpful for teaching basic research design concepts, for contemplating research design decisions in planning a study, and as a basis for further consideration of a more detailed, uniform research design classification system.\r"

An open-ended question about reasons for continuing or discontinuing treatment obtained data from 48 trial participants on completion of the trial and six months later. Physical factors were the most commonly cited reasons for continuing treatment; stabilization of the condition was mentioned as well as improvement. Lack of effectiveness was more commonly given as a reason to stop therapy six months after the trial. Social and practical reasons were also cited as reasons for discontinuing therapy and there was implicit evidence of a high level of social support enabling patients to continue therapy. Most problems appeared to have surfaced by the end of the trial. Epistemological reasons provided rationales for the decisions taken and referred particularly to the time required to make an informed judgement about the effectiveness of treatment. Personal experience and knowledge of the effects of hyperbaric oxygen on others were more significant to the decision than anticipation of the trial's formal results. The participants in the trial were sophisticated and responsible decision-makers even though their judgements would not always have coincided with medical opinion.\r"

Evidence is presented of causal relationships between adverse life events and illness onset and we discuss ways in which these events may be detected and measured. The notion that 'moderating variables' may affect both an individual's vulnerability to the effects of adversity and the coping strategies adopted to deal with life stress is emphasized. Typically, research has focused on the effect of a single psychosocial variable on the correlation between life events and illness. We conclude that research aimed at eliciting factors associated with successful coping is of more importance if primary care physicians are to identify vulnerable patients and make therapeutic interventions to minimize the damaging effect of stress and adversity.\r"

Twelve hours after the addition of anti-CD3 or pokeweed mitogen, most lamina propria T cells expressed CD25. By 18 and 24 h after the addition of anti-CD3, there were significantly more crypt cells in the cell cycle than in controls, although villus height and crypt depth are the same in both groups. After 3 days, by dissecting microscopy, the villi appeared shorter in cultures in which the T cells were stimulated than in control cultures, and the mucosal surface was obscured by a layer of extruded enterocytes. Villus atrophy was confirmed by direct measurement of Feulgen-stained, microdissected villi. Crypts were longer in T-cell-stimulated cultures, and the rate of crypt epithelial cell proliferation measured by metaphase arrest was increased 10-fold. By electron microscopy, the microvilli and cellular morphology of the surface enterocytes were normal in T-cell-stimulated cultures. These experiments clearly show that a profound immune-mediated crypt epithelial cell hyperplasia can occur in the absence of damage to surface enterocytes.\r"

It occurred with nearly equal frequency in \"normal\" livers and variously diseased livers. Histologically, heterotopic pancreas was situated exclusively in the large- and medium-sized portal tracts, and its size ranged from 250-900 microns in diameter. It was intermingled with intrahepatic peribiliary glands and appeared to communicate with bile duct lumina. Heterotopic pancreas consisted of three cell types: acinar cells with eosinophilic zymogenlike granules, clear cells resembling centriacinar cells, and ductular elements. Langerhans' islets were not found in any cases. Immunohistochemically, constituent cells of heterotopic pancreas contained pancreatic alpha-amylase and trypsin but lacked argentaffin and argyrophilic cells as well as insulin-, glucagon-, and somatostatin-immunoreactive endocrine cells. Ultrastructurally, acinar cells contained many dense granules regarded as zymogen granules. It is indicated that intrahepatic heterotopic pancreas occurs in large portal tracts. It may modify hepatic bile by secreting pancreatic enzymes into intrahepatic bile duct lumina.\r"

  ".W": "Phospholipases are enzymes that hydrolyze specific portions of phospholipid molecules. Their role in the digestion of exogenous phospholipids and as the active principle in snake and bee venoms has long been appreciated. Interest has increased in phospholipases recently because of new data implicating them in the inflammatory response. The ability of phospholipases to hydrolyze bacterial phospholipids has also received considerable attention. These new data have brought pertinence to studies of the physicochemical nature of potential substrates that greatly influence enzyme activity. Interest in the regulation of enzyme activity, both by physiological and pharmacological means, has increased as the importance of the phospholipases in response to various stimuli has become better appreciated. Finally, considerable interest has focused on the role of the phospholipases in response to hormones in a variety of cell systems. Data pertinent to all of these areas of interest will be discussed in this review with a view toward stimulating those with an interest in gastrointestinal physiology to apply them to their own areas of research in the gastrointestinal tract or liver.\r"

The patients' swallowing ability was assessed before and during the remainder of their life on a 0-4 scale with 0 being normal swallowing and 4 total dysphagia. The patient's quality of life was measured at the same times, using a physician's assessment (QL index) and the patient's own assessment using a linear analogue self assessment (LASA). There was a significant correlation between all the QL index and the LASA scores collected (n = 126; rs = 0.594, p less than 0.001). The mean monthly dysphagia grade correlated with the QL index (rs = 0.433, p less than 0.001) and the LASA (rs = 0.272, p less than 0.002). There was no significant difference in the dysphagia grade before or after treatment in either group. Dysphagia fluctuated more in those treated with the laser only, however, than in those with a tube inserted. There was also no significant difference in the quality of life measured between the two groups of patients. The complication rate (laser only 10%, laser/intubation 40%, p less than 0.05) was significantly higher in intubated patients. The recurrent dysphagia rate (laser only 25%, laser/intubation 45%, NS) was higher in patients treated with intubation, but they required fewer endoscopic procedures. Overall both procedures were effective in relieving dysphagia and in maintaining quality of life. There was no procedure related mortality in either group.\r"

No differences were observed between the cases and controls in duration of diabetes, glycated haemoglobin A1, alcohol intake, smoking, use of cardiovascular drugs or a history of myocardial infarction. Diabetics with gall stone disease had higher fasting insulin concentrations (p less than 0.5), lower total (p less than 0.01) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (p less than 0.01) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (not statistically significant) concentrations than diabetics without gall stone disease. These changes in insulin, lipids and lipoproteins are similar to reported changes in non-diabetic subjects with gall stone disease. Therefore, they are characteristic for gall stone disease and not as such explanatory to an increased risk of gall stones in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes.\r"

At six weeks, 49% of the Pyrogastrone treated subjects and 37% of the cimetidine treated subjects were healed. After 12 weeks the cumulative healing rates were 64% for Pyrogastrone and 66% for cimetidine. Compared with baseline both drugs achieved similarly significant improvements in symptom score, endoscopic and histological grading even in those who did not heal completely. Response was not related to length of symptoms or initial severity of oesophagitis. Eleven of 25 (44%) patients healed with Pyrogastrone relapsed within one year compared with 15 of 27 (56%) healed with cimetidine. Although this trend in favour of Pyrogastrone was not significant at one year the early relapse rate was significantly greater in cimetidine treated subjects. At six weeks, five cimetidine treated subjects had relapsed compared with none in the Pyrogastrone group (p = 0.05). This study shows that Pyrogastrone and cimetidine are equally effective in the healing of oesophagitis and raises the possibility that Pyrogastrone has marginal benefits in terms of time to relapse.\r"

Seventy consecutive outpatients were given cimetropium (50 mg tid) or placebo according to a double blind, randomised, parallel groups design. Symptoms were evaluated initially and at monthly intervals up to the end of the study period. One patient receiving placebo withdrew because of treatment failure. Pain score decreased by 40, 66, 85% in the cimetropium group, at the end of the first, second and third months respectively, compared with 26, 32 and 52% reductions among controls (p = 0.0005). At the end of treatment there was a 86% reduction in the number of abdominal pain episodes per day in the cimetropium group compared with 50% in the placebo group (p = 0.001). Constipation and diarrhoea scores decreased by 59 and 49% in the cimetropium treated patients, compared with 37 and 39% in controls, the differences between being not significant. At the end of the study 89% of the patients treated with cimetropium considered themselves as globally improved as opposed to 69% in the placebo group (p = 0.039). The corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the differences between the proportion of improved patients in the two groups were from 11% to 29%. Six patients taking cimetropium complained of slight dry mouth. The results of this study showed that cimetropium bromide is effective in relieving pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The major finding of this analysis is that acute anti-migraine agents (e.g., ergots, sumatriptan) share high affinity for 5-HT1D receptors. This receptor appears to be present in certain intracranial blood vessels. It is also found on nerve terminals where it inhibits the release of 5-HT and other neurotransmitters. Theoretically, 5-HT1D receptor agonists may acutely inhibit the release of vasoactive and/or pain-inducing substances in the perivascular space. Conceivably, drugs acting at this receptor would stop the progression of this perivascular process. In contrast, a number of prophylactic anti-migraine drugs share a relatively high affinity for 5-HT2 receptors in human brain. Although this receptor is also found in certain blood vessels, it is present throughout the nervous system. The receptor appears to mediate neuronal depolarizations at the cellular level. No hypothesis, at present, readily explains the effectiveness of prophylactic anti-migraine drugs based on this receptor. These data offer a novel approach to the analysis of anti-migraine agents. Drugs could be selected for use in clinical migraine studies based on their selectivity for a specific 5-HT receptor subtype. \"Pure\" drugs could be chosen which would essentially limit the number of possible sites of action for the drugs. For example, an agent which displays both high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT1D receptors could be clinically evaluated. Its effectiveness, or lack thereof, would indicate the importance of the specific 5-HT receptor site in the pathogenesis of migraine. Further attempts to determine a common mechanism of action for effective anti-migraine agents should facilitate the elucidation of the pathogenesis of this neurological syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A dull or throbbing occipital ache characteristically worsened by sitting or standing and eased by lying down is peculiar to both. Additional symptoms and signs may accompany the headache. In PLPHA the pain is triggered by leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the dural rent, but the cause of the pain is probably due to intracranial arterial and venous dilatation. The same mechanism probably applies to spontaneous hypoliquorrheic headache in which the site of leakage is rarely found. The majority of cases subside without treatment over several days. Those that persist may be treated with epidural blood patch or saline infusion with good results. A simple, innocuous, yet underutilized form of treatment is caffeine sodium benzoate. This review will discuss the incidence, pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of these headaches.\r"

The thrombosis was in the popliteal or a more proximal vein in six of the eight patients, whereas in two it was distal to the popliteal vein. In four patients, evidence of thrombosis developed after one or more normal duplex-ultrasound studies. In one patient, symptoms that were suggestive of deep-vein thrombosis developed fifty-two days after the injury (four days after the fourth normal duplex-ultrasound examination), and ascending venography was entirely normal. Another patient had a pulmonary embolus fifteen days after the injury, and on the same day a duplex-ultrasound study was positive for thrombosis. During six weeks of follow-up after discharge from the hospital, symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism did not develop in any patient in whom serial duplex-ultrasound studies had been negative.\r"

The left ventricle was opened through the aneurysm or the anterior wall when only anterior septal fibrosis was present. In patients with large aneurysms, two purse-string sutures were placed on the inside surface of the intact ventricle, around its limits, for approximation. The fibrosed septum was thus excluded from the new ventricular cavity. A patch was placed between the fibrosed and the healthy septum, reaching to the ventricular wall, all around the transitional edge. Both, ventricular geometry and function were improved. All patients were asymptomatic after one year follow-up.\r"

Whilst intrinsic structural failure is increasingly uncommon constant clinical awareness of its occurrence in a patient with a mechanical valve presenting with unexplained acute heart failure and pulmonary oedema, and prompt surgical intervention offers the best chance of survival. The aetiology of the primary fracture in this case remains unclear.\r"

For primarily closed vessels these numbers were respectively 14.5% for male and 24.4% for female arteries. More than 1 year after surgery, no significant difference between the 4 groups was demonstrated and the mean annual rate of recurrent stenosis amounted to 1.7%.

Rather, respiratory viruses influence bronchial smooth muscle function through a variety of other mechanisms: production of virus-specific IgE antibodies, epithelial injury, polymorphonuclear-dependent inflammation, and enhanced mediator release. Thus, a common pathway to airway hyper-reactivity during respiratory viral illnesses is an overall enhancement of factors that cause or lead to inflammation. When the airways become the target of enhanced inflammation, bronchial reactivity and obstruction are accentuated. Although many questions remain to be answered, future studies to evaluate the biology of respiratory virus effects on mechanisms of allergic sensitization and airway responsiveness promise to provide a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma.\r"

Prevention, rather than therapy, is the primary goal in managing many of these conditions. With all such diseases, it is most important to take into account the patient's environment and to record a thorough occupational and environmental history. The concept of environmental agents as causative factors of disease in man dates to antiquity but has assumed considerably greater significance in recent years. In this context, it should be remembered that Hippocrates and Socrates both emphasized that a good physician should strongly consider the patient's environment as an aid in diagnosis. Of equal importance was the recommendation by Bernardo Ramazzini in 1713, that, \"in addition to the questions and recommendations of Hippocrates,\" a careful inquiry into the patient's occupation should be made.\r"

We prospectively examined the incidence of immediate adverse reaction after protamine in 243 patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Twenty-six patients (10.7%) had reactions, and 1.6% had a precipitous drop in blood pressure immediately after protamine administration. Risk factors were previous exposure to protamine, diabetes, history of receiving protamine-containing insulin, and possibly vasectomy. However, neither a positive skin test nor a positive IgE ELISA for antiprotamine antibody predicted that a patient would have a reaction. C4a levels were increased in patients who had reactions as compared with age-, sex-, and cardiac disease-matched patients who did not have reactions, suggesting a role for complement in some reactions. Immediate adverse reactions to protamine are very common, and alternative therapies are urgently needed to eliminate the use of protamine.\r"

Forty-five adult patients with reversible obstructive airway disease were studied during administration of three different dosages of procaterol, 25 micrograms escalating to 100 micrograms, and 100 micrograms twice daily. Tremor was quantitatively evaluated with a Grass model accelerometer. The patients were evaluated during 8 hours approximately every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Daily diaries of symptoms and side effects were also maintained. The study demonstrated no direct relationship between tremor and pulmonary function as far as time of onset, peak effect, or duration. Although tachyphylaxis was demonstrated, much of the tolerance developed to the tremor was explained by an increase in baseline tremor. Procaterol was demonstrated to be an effective bronchodilator, and tolerance to tremor was demonstrated to develop with time but is highly variable. There was not a direct relationship between tremor and pulmonary function, indicating possible differences between lung and peripheral muscle beta 2-receptors. It appeared that the best way to minimize the problem of tremor is to begin with a lower dose and increase the dose gradually during a period of weeks.\r"

This study investigated whether or not theophylline at different serum concentrations had any effect on bronchial hyperreactivity, as measured by methacholine challenges. Twelve adult subjects with mild asthma participated. All subjects were atopic and were nonsmokers. Subjects were studied on three separate occasions according to a double-blind, randomized, crossover study design with one of the following medications: two placebo capsules in the morning and evening, a placebo and 250 mg of sustained-release theophylline in the morning and evening, or two 250 mg sustained-release theophylline capsules each morning and evening. Subjects were administered their medication between 5 and 15 days before performing methacholine challenges in the morning at the presumed trough level, and in the afternoon at the presumed peak serum theophylline level. Despite statistically significant differences in the pulmonary function and theophylline levels between the two active dosages (p less than 0.05 for both), there was no difference in methacholine sensitivity at the time of ingestion of the two dosage forms. There was also no correlation between a particular theophylline level and degree of methacholine sensitivity. It was concluded that, although theophylline has significant bronchodilator capability, it has little, if any, effect on bronchial hyperreactivity, as measured by methacholine challenges. Thus, other forms of long-term therapy should be used in reducing bronchial hyperreactivity.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the ability of salbutamol to protect against bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine, histamine, and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) in nine subjects with asthma. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, salbutamol, 2.5 mg administered by nebulization, increased the geometric mean provocation concentrations of methacholine, histamine, and AMP required to produce a 20% decrease in FEV1 from 0.3 to 2.2, 0.4 to 3.8, and 4.0 to 106.7 mg/ml after placebo and active treatment, respectively (p less than 0.01). Thus, this dose of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist displaced the concentration-response curves for methacholine, histamine, and AMP to the right in a parallel fashion by 8.8 (0.6 to 29.3)-, 10.3 (1.4 to 33)-, and 26.6 (1.5 to 76.6)-fold, respectively, the difference between the results for AMP and those for histamine and methacholine being statistically significant (p less than 0.01). For six of the nine subjects studied, salbutamol displaced the concentration-response curve for AMP to the right by greater than 50-fold. There was no correlation between bronchodilatation and protection against bronchoconstriction induced by any of the agonists. We conclude that salbutamol protects against bronchoconstriction provoked by methacholine and histamine by functional antagonism, whereas with AMP, an additional activity is demonstrable, possibly involving inhibition of mast cell-mediator release.\r"

The two groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of atopic disease. The IgE level was significantly higher in the patients, however, than in the control subjects, whether there was atopy (296.1 versus 96.3 IU/ml) or not atopy (72.9 versus 18.9 IU/ml). Neither RAST nor immunoblotting technique detected significant levels of IgE antibodies to M. leprae. Our data indicate that leprosy was associated with increased total IgE level, but clinical atopy in patients with leprosy was similar to that in control subjects. The observed IgE increase in patients with leprosy appears to be generally nonspecific.\r"

As to causation, dietetically, it was contended that the increase was promoted primarily by an associated fall in dietary fiber intake. The recently advanced hygiene hypothesis considers the increase to have stemmed from improvements in hygiene, generally; these limited exposure to enteric infections and modified response to virus infections, thereby triggering appendicitis. Major uncertainties still prevail over the promotive and precipitating factors of the disease. It is doubtful whether individuals can take any action to avoid appendicitis.\r"

Since 1950, 21 cases of isolated tuberculoma or tuberculous abscess of the liver have been reported in the world literature. We report an additional two cases, one tuberculoma and one with multiple tuberculous abscesses. The case reports illustrate the difficulty in reaching the correct diagnosis, unsuspected in nearly all cases and most often confused with carcinoma of the liver. The correct diagnosis was made by histology, identification of acid-fast organisms by smear, and by cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but required laparotomy in 19 of the 23 cases. A greater awareness of this rare clinical entity may prevent needless surgical intervention since the vast majority of patients respond well to antituberculous chemotherapy.\r"

The study was a crossover, randomized, double-blind trial where placebo and drug were given daily in identical capsules (300 mg) for 2 weeks each, with a 1 week washout before and after each cycle. Mean duration of pruritus was 1.6 years (range of 4 months-5 years). Blood tests were done weekly and patients used a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 100 to mark their level of itchiness daily. Only transaminases were significantly lower while the patients were on rifampin. VAS scores were minimally affected by either rifampin or placebo. At the end of the trial, four patients said they were less itchy on rifampin and three preferred placebo. Of these seven patients, small falls in VAS scores occurred in two patients on rifampin and two on placebo; there was no change in the remaining three. There was little change in serum bile salt levels during the trial. No patient became jaundiced and deepening of jaundice did not occur in the four patients with initially elevated bilirubin. We conclude that a daily 300 mg dose of rifampin was not effective in relieving pruritus in a variety of chronic liver diseases.\r"

In all these lines, the transgenes are expressed at the RNA and protein level with correct tissue and cell type specificity. Crosses between certain of them yield progeny displaying very high surface levels of class II protein--roughly five times the normal amount--allowing us to evaluate the consequences of quantitative variation in Ia molecule density on the organization and function of the immune system. The effects appear rather limited: we detect subtle changes in thymic lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as an enhanced Ag presentation capacity in vitro. Yet, in vivo responses are largely unaffected, and Ia overexpression to such levels does not provoke lymphoproliferation, immunodeficiency, or autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "We previously characterized a dimeric, Mr = 115,000, developmentally regulated mouse T cell-activating molecule (THAM). We show in this report that the THAM-specific mAb H194-112 exhibits strong reactivity with several nonlymphoid tissues including polarized enterocytes from small intestine, kidney cortical tubuli, and liver bile ductuli, as well as kidney glomeruli and lung alveoloar pneumocytes. Both the tissue distribution and the structural features of THAM made it likely that this molecule belongs to the ectoenzyme family. This was confirmed by the following experimental evidence: 1) the H194-112+ molecules from enterocyte brush borders (BB) or M14.T thymoma cells were recognized by several antisera specific for intestinal aminopeptidase N (AP-N); 2) mAb H194-112 was found to immunodeplete the AP-N activity from both thymic or enterocyte BB detergent extracts; 3) the hydrophilic, Mr = 115,000 form obtained by papain treatment of thymoma or enterocyte BB could be immunopurified on H194-112 column and exhibited, after hypotonic elution, strong enzymatic activity on the AP-N substrates (i.e., leucyl or alanyl beta-derivatives); 4) mAb H194-112 was found to inhibit the AP-N activity when assayed on alanyl but not leucyl beta-naphthylamide substrate; and 5) preincubation of AP-N with mAb H194-112 prevented the inhibiting effects of bestatin and D,L-methionyl hydroxamate on AP-N activity. These data add a new member to the list of functional ectoenzymatic markers of lymphoid cells (i.e., CD10, CD13, CD26, CD55, and CD73). In view of the known immunomodulating properties of bestatin, one may speculate that the T cell-activating effects of mAb H194-112 is related to an impairment of a surface enzymatic function regulating lymphoid cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Tp103 is a 103-kDa T cell activation molecule that defines an alternative activation signal for human T lymphocytes. It is absent from or present in only low amounts on resting T cells but is expressed strongly after activation. Cross-linking of Tp103 via a mAb CB.1 leads to triggering of functional activities in preactivated CD3+ T lymphocytes. By using mAb CB.1 in immunohistology we found that Tp103 is expressed in epithelial cells of various tissues, such as kidney, prostate, epidermis and on endothelia of liver, spleen, lungs, and most vessels, and in bile duct canaliculi in the liver. We found a carcinoma cell line expressing Tp103 and could precipitate a 110-kDa molecule from the surface of these cells. We considered several known molecules of similar distribution and molecular mass for identity with Tp103 and show here that Tp103 is probably identical to the proteolytic enzyme dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV. When we purified Tp103 by affinity chromatography, typical dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV activity copurified with Tp103. On activated T cells the enzymatic activity associated with Tp103 is expressed on the outside of the cell. We show that mAb CB.1 recognizes the same molecule as the anti-CD26 mAb anti-Ta1. The anti-Ta1 mAb was found to have T cell-activating activity too, but to differ in its requirements for triggering of T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "In a Th cell-dependent antibody response, the Th act on B cells partly via a helper activity that is cell contact-dependent and cyclosporine A (CsA)-resistant. This activity seems to be required to induce responsiveness of the B cells toward T cell-derived soluble factors (cytokines) generally believed to be essential for B cell proliferation as well as for Ig secretion. In our study, we have investigated a system in which human B cells are stimulated by mutant EL-4 thymoma cells of mouse origin. It was found that human B cells proliferate and secrete Ig (either 1) in the presence of EL-4 cells plus human T cell supernatant (T-SUP), or 2) in the presence of EL-4 cells alone which have been induced with PMA or IL-1. The first situation conformed to the known synergy between CsA-resistant Th signal and cytokines. However, the B response due to PMA-induced EL-4 cells was special. The PMA-inducible helper activity was CsA-sensitive at the same CsA concentration that inhibited IL-2 secretion of EL-4 cells, but the murine factors in EL-4 supernatant had no effect on human B cells; the helper effect did not occur across a semipermeable membrane. Any contribution of soluble factors from contaminating human T cells was ruled out by adding single human B cells by flow microfluorimetry to cultures with EL-4 cells and PMA. Such B cells generated clonal IgM, IgG, and/or IgA responses. CsA, thus, interfered with some cell contact-mediated signal. However, CsA did not reduce the amount of LFA-1 molecules on EL-4 cells. In conclusion, EL-4 cells can induce proliferation and differentiation of human B cells in a soluble factor-independent manner, via CsA-resistant and CsA-sensitive helper activities. This may represent an alternative pathway of B cell activation.\r"

In this study, 11 of 14 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected homosexuals and hemophiliacs, but none of 17 uninfected homosexuals or heterosexuals, were found to have cytotoxic lymphocytes in blood that can lyse uninfected CD4+ T cells from humans and chimpanzees but not human B lymphoblastoid cells or mouse T cells. The cytotoxic PBL were concluded to be CTL rather than NK cells, with the phenotype being CD3+, TCR-1 alpha beta+, CD8+, CD4-, CD16- based on findings that PBL-mediated lysis of uninfected CD4+ cells was 1) blocked by a mAb to CD3, which inhibits CTL but not NK activity; 2) diminished by treatment of PBL with a mAb to CD8 and C, but not by treatment with mAb to CD4 or CD16 and C; and 3) blocked by mAb WT31 directed against the TCR-1 alpha beta. In contrast, PBL from HIV-1-infected chimpanzees, which to date have not developed AIDS, lacked detectable CTL lytic for uninfected CD4+ cells.\r"

Previous studies have suggested that the decidual suppressor factor (DSF) is smaller than TGF-beta 1, and in this paper, we show that DSF on HPLC-sieving columns also elutes later than TGF-beta 2. Nevertheless, DSF has the ability to promote anchorage-independent growth of NRK fibroblasts similar to TGF-beta s. Using turkey antibodies specific for TGF-beta 1 or beta 2, we show that DSF is related to TGF-beta 2 rather than TGF-beta 1, and this relationship was confirmed by using a panel of murine mAb to TGF-subtypes. PAGE and Western blotting showed that the TGF-beta 2-reactive molecules in HPLC-purified DSF was slightly smaller than TGF-beta 2 and approximately 20 to 23 kDa. The DSF molecule is therefore closely related to TGF-beta 2 but as released from decidua, differs in size. The TGF-beta 2-related decidual suppressor factor was also obtained from the decidua of synpregnant C.B.-17 severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) and pregnant SCID-BG (C57BL/6 background) mice, confirming the lack of T or B cell dependence of DSF production and the generality of production of a TGF-beta-related suppressor factor by decidua associated with successful pregnancy in mice.\r"

Our study was designed to define the capacity of human endothelial cells (HEC) to produce a novel, recently purified, and molecularly cloned monocyte chemotactic and activating factor. This factor has been identified in the culture supernatants of tumor cell lines (tumor-derived chemotactic factor (TDCF)) as well as activated monocytes and fibroblasts (monocyte chemotactic and activating protein, MCAF, or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, MCP-1). IL-1 induced high levels of production of chemotactic activity for monocytes in culture supernatants of HEC. IL-1-treated HEC expressed high levels of MCAF/MCP-1/TDCF mRNA transcripts, as assessed by Northern blot analysis. TNF and LPS, unlike IL-6, also induced MCAF/MCP-1/TDCF gene expression. Nuclear run off experiments revealed that IL-1-activated transcription of the MCAF/MCP-1/TDCF gene. The production of MCAF/MCP-1/TDCF may represent one of the mechanisms whereby endothelial cells, exposed to inflammatory signals, participate in the regulation of leukocyte extravasation. Production of this cytokine by vascular cells may in particular be relevant under conditions of selective extravasation and activation of mononuclear phagocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90217513\r", 
  ".W": "The adhesion of leukocytes to vascular endothelium is the first step in their passage from the blood into inflammatory tissues. By modulating endothelial cell (EC) adhesiveness for leukocytes, cytokines may regulate leukocyte accumulation and hence the nature and progression of inflammatory responses. We have found that the T cell cytokine IL-4 increases the adhesion of T cells, but not neutrophils, to human umbilical vein EC monolayers. The increase in T cell adhesion induced by IL-4 was dose dependent (ED50 = 5 U/ml) and peaked around 33 U/ml. No increase in adhesion of neutrophils was observed at concentrations of IL-4 up to 1000 U/ml. The kinetic of the increase in T cell adhesion exhibited a steady rise peaking between 18 and 24 h before returning to basal levels by 72 h. The IL-4 specificity of the effect was confirmed by the ability of neutralizing anti-IL-4, but not anti-TNF, antibodies to abolish the effect. The increase in T cell-EC adhesion was due to an effect of IL-4 on EC inasmuch as preincubation of the T cells with IL-4 did not increase T cell binding. Furthermore, preincubation of A549 epithelial cell line monolayers with IL-4 caused no increase in T cell binding whereas A549 cells and EC showed a similarly enhanced adhesiveness for T cells after preincubation with IL-1, TNF, or IFN-gamma. EC treated with IL-4 retained their increased adhesiveness for T cells after light fixation, suggesting that IL-4 up-regulates binding by increasing the expression or accessibility of EC surface receptors for lymphocytes. Although antibodies to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) and the beta-chain (CD18) of lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 (CD11a/CD18) partially inhibited T cell adhesion to unstimulated EC, they did not affect the increase in adhesion due to IL-4 stimulation, indicating that the increased binding resulted from the generation of an alternative binding receptor(s) on the EC membrane. These findings suggest that IL-4 may play a role in the selective recruitment of T cells into sites of immune-mediated chronic inflammation.\r"

By immunostaining, extensive reactivity was observed on the placental trophoblast epithelium and this was confined exclusively to sites of direct contact with maternal blood and tissues at the fetomaternal interface. Within the fetus, by contrast, very little staining was observed especially on hemopoietic cell populations in the developing liver. The antibodies identified a component of 70,000 m.w., comigrating on SDS-PAGE with red cell DAF, on isolated trophoblast membranes and an apparently quantitative increase in the expression of DAF was observed during placental development. Northern analysis using a DAF cDNA clone revealed 1.5-, 1.6-, and 2.2-kb mRNA transcripts typical of DAF in mRNA prepared from whole term placentae and from purified trophoblast cells. DAF appears to be preferentially expressed at the fetomaternal interface during development and may function specifically to inhibit amplification convertases formed at this site either directly or indirectly as a result of maternal complement activation. This molecule may play an important role in protecting the semiallogeneic human conceptus from maternal C-mediated attack.\r"

It was suggested that the O-specific polysaccharide moiety enhanced the C activation by the lipid A portion. This was also supported by the finding that modification of the O-specific polysaccharide moiety with Con A or tyramine decreased anticomplementary activity of KO3 LPS, and that the other LPS preparations possessing the mannose homopolysaccharides as the O-specific polysaccharide portions such as KO3 LPS, such as LPS from Klebsiella O5, Escherichia coli O8 and O9, exhibited a high anticomplementary activity. KO3 LPS could activate the C system in either the classical or the alternative pathway, whereas the lipid A or R form LPS activated the classical pathway alone. The intensity of anticomplementary activity of LPS was parallel to that of their adjuvant action on antibody response to deaggregated BSA.

  ".U": "90217524\r", 
  ".W": "Lymphocyte entry into lymph nodes and Peyer's patches is initiated by the adhesion of the lymphocytes to specialized postcapillary high endothelial venules (HEV). The binding of lymphocytes to lymph node HEV is mediated by the cell surface receptor gp90MEL-14 (gp90). Previous work has shown that gp90 is down-regulated over a period of days after mitogenic or mixed lymphocyte reaction stimulation of T lymphocytes. In our study, it is shown that stimulation of lymphocytes with activators of protein kinase C (PKC), such as PMA or 1-oleoyl 2-acetyl-glycerol, results in the nearly complete loss of surface expression of gp90 within 1 h. Pretreatment of the cells with H-7 or staurosporine, PKC inhibitors, but not HA1004, a general protein kinase inhibitor, prevents the loss of gp90MEL-14. Within 15 min of stimulation of PKC, a novel form of gp90 can be immunoprecipitated from the supernatant of stimulated cells. Upon deglycosylation, this soluble gp90 polypeptide is shown to be 12 kDa smaller than the cell surface protein. Peptide mapping showed identical patterns for surface and soluble receptor, confirming that the soluble Ag is related to the cell membrane protein. Together, these experiments suggest that activation of PKC results in the proteolytic cleavage of gp90MEL-14, resulting in receptor shedding and the inability of the lymphocytes to adhere to HEV endothelium. Furthermore, because supernatant from unstimulated, normal lymphocytes also contains a small amount of the low Mr form of gp90, cell surface proteolysis may be part of the normal turnover of this receptor glycoprotein. These experiments suggest that PKC may play a role in the regulation of lymphocyte traffic to lymphoid tissues.\r"

  ".W": "The Ity locus affects the net increase in numbers of Salmonella typhimurium in the liver and spleen of infected mice. There has been controversy, however, about whether the effects of this locus are due to differential killing of S. typhimurium or differential growth rates of S. typhimurium in mice. Our studies using S. typhimurium aroA mutants, which do not grow in vivo, demonstrate that growth of the infecting salmonella is necessary for the observation of the Ity phenotype. To examine the effects of the Ity locus on the growth and killing of fully virulent salmonella, we infected Ity-congenic mice i.v. with stationary phase S. typhimurium containing a single copy of the plasmid pHSG422. This plasmid exhibits defective replication at body temperature and is diluted out during salmonella growth in vivo. Thus, the frequency of plasmid-containing salmonella recovered from mice provides a measure of salmonella cell divisions in vivo. Inasmuch as the numbers of plasmid-containing salmonella are only slightly affected by bacterial division, any decline in the numbers of plasmid-containing salmonella is an unbiased measure of killing. By infecting mice with these plasmid-containing salmonella we observed that: 1) during the first four h post infection (during blood clearance of injected salmonella) there is about 3-fold more killing of salmonella in Ityr mice than in Itys mice; 2) from 4 to 44 h postinfection (after blood clearance is completed) there is little if any additional killing in either Itys or Ityr mice; and 3) during the first 48 h postinfection there is about 18-fold more growth of salmonella in Itys mice than in Ityr mice. Thus, the major effect of the Ity locus on resistance to salmonella, is the regulation of growth within a \"safe\" (relatively nonbactericidal) site in the liver and spleen.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that the steady state levels of transcripts encoded by an endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) increase during LPS-induced differentiation of both normal B lymphocytes and an inducible B cell lymphoma, CH12. A large body of evidence suggests that MMTV expression is primarily limited to mammary tissues and that expression in cell lines from nonmammary tissues is accompanied by viral amplification and alterations in the transcriptional control regions of the viral long terminal repeat. We have, therefore, carefully characterized MMTV expression in CH12 cells and in other cells of the B lineage in order to determine if the expression of MMTV transcripts in differentiating B cells results from the \"abnormal\" transcriptional regulation seen in other nonmammary tissue. In this manuscript, we present evidence that MMTV transcripts are expressed in a variety of cells of the B lineage and that the levels of constitutive expression vary among the different cells. On the other hand, T cell lymphomas lacking amplified MMTV do not contain proviral transcripts, suggesting that MMTV transcription may be preferentially expressed in B lymphocytes. We demonstrate that MMTV transcripts are up-regulated during cytokine-mediated as well as LPS-mediated differentiation, and that most, if not all, expression is due to the activity of a single proviral gene, Mtv-9, in CH12 cells. Furthermore, the expression of MMTV transcripts in CH12 cells neither requires nor is accompanied by amplification of the provirus. Sequence analysis demonstrates that the U3 region of the expressed Mtv-9 long terminal repeat contains neither deletions nor insertions, and the well-characterized enhancer and promoter sites in the glucocorticoid response element which are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation of MMTV in mammary tissues have not been disrupted. These data suggest that the Mtv-9 locus behaves as a normal somatic gene which is differentially regulated during B cell development and differentiation. Unlike the events which lead to MMTV expression in other nonmammary tissues, B cells may express transcription factor(s) which are capable of inducing expression of endogenous MMTV proviral genes during the natural course of differentiation. Analysis of the mechanisms which control the expression of this gene should be useful in characterizing the molecular events which govern B cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The bullous pemphigoid antigen was originally described as a 240-kD protein extracted from human epidermis, but a subsequent report has described patients' sera which react with epidermal proteins of molecular masses 240, 200, 180, 97, and 77 kD. We have evaluated the heterogeneity of the pemphigoid antigens identified by the sera of 10 patients with clinically typical bullous pemphigoid. We used indirect immunofluorescence and Western immunoblots of epidermal extracts prepared from epidermis separated by either 1 M salt or 20 mM EDTA to characterize the reactivity of both crude sera and affinity-purified antibodies. Affinity purification of antibodies was performed with either normal human epidermis or protein bands blotted onto nitrocellulose as immunoabsorbents. The anti-basement membrane antibody titers determined by indirect immunofluorescence on the saline- and EDTA-separated epidermis were identical. Despite this, Western blots of extracts prepared from EDTA-separated epidermis demonstrated greater amounts of the 240-kD antigen than saline split skin. Multiple antigens were recognized in epidermal extracts on Western blots by most crude BP sera, including bands at 240, 200, 160, and 100 kD. Different sera reacted with these antigens with a markedly different intensity, falling into two major groups, those bearing antibodies to the 240-200-kD antigens and those with antibodies to the 160-100-kD components. When epidermis was used as a substrate for affinity purification of bullous pemphigoid antibodies, the eluted antibodies reacted with multiple bands on Western blots, demonstrating the reactivity of anti-basement membrane zone antibodies with multiple proteins. Antibodies eluted from several individual bands of immunoblots were found to react with the basement membrane on indirect immunofluorescence. When these nitrocellulose-purified antibodies were reapplied to Western blots, they cross-reacted within two groups, the 240-200 kD antigens and the 160-100 kD antigens. We conclude that pemphigoid antigens are best demonstrated when EDTA-split skin is used for extraction and that different pemphigoid sera may contain antibodies to two separate groups of basement membrane zone antigens.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 11 consecutive patients with classical cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) using direct immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) and Western immunoblotting analysis. Direct IEM performed in the skin or gingival mucosa revealed in all 11 CP patients that immunoglobulins and complement deposits were usually thick and discontinuous along the dermoepidermal junction, mostly localized on the lamina densa and occasionally in the lamina lucida. By direct IEM, the ultrastructural aspect in CP differs from the pattern observed in bullous pemphigoid (BP) and from that of chronic epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA). Nine CP patients were studied by Western immunoblotting and, of these nine, only two had detectable anti-basement membrane zone (BMZ) antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence on salt-split skin. By immunoblotting performed on protein extracts of heat-separated epidermis, eight out of the nine CP sera specifically reacted with two protein bands of approximately 230-240 kD and 180 kD, similar to those recognized by BP sera in co-migration experiments. By immunoblotting on skin BMZ extracts, none of these nine CP sera recognized the 290-kD major polypeptide of EBA antigen. Taken together, these results suggest that, in CP, the target-antigen, as identified on immunoblots, is similar to BP antigen, but with an abnormal expression within the dermoepidermal junction of patients, which may in part explain the scarring course of the disease.\r"

  ".U": "90217587\r", 
  ".W": "Linear IgA bullous dermatosis and dermatitis herpetiformis are inflammatory subepidermal blistering diseases characterized by IgA deposits at the cutaneous epithelial basement membrane and in dermal papillae, respectively. Inflammation in both disorders localizes to sites of IgA deposition and is characterized by a predominance of neutrophils. From these observations we postulate that IgA deposits in both diseases may contribute to the recruitment and/or localization of neutrophils. In this study we examined the ability of in vitro and in vivo bound IgA anti-basement membrane autoantibodies from patients with linear IgA bullous dermatosis and in vivo bound IgA deposits in dermal papillae from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis to mediate adherence of neutrophils stimulated by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The study showed that stimulated neutrophils adhered to basement membranes and dermal papillae containing IgA deposits. Adherence was IgA anti-basement membrane antibody concentration dependent and correlated with the immunofluorescence staining intensity of IgA deposits in dermal papillae. Adherence to IgA deposits but not IgG deposits could be inhibited by purified exogenous secretory IgA but not IgG and adherence to IgG deposits could be inhibited by purified exogenous IgG but not secretory IgA. These results provide direct experimental evidence that cutaneous IgA deposits in linear IgA bullous dermatosis and dermatitis herpetiformis can function as ligands for neutrophil adherence and have a role in the localization of inflammation in these disorders.\r"

An indirect immunoperoxidase technique was used. Eight of the MoAb detected epidermal antigens similar to patterns well known for human sera. Five of these MoAb detected determinants in the dermis, too. These observations may indicate a certain degree of similarity between the antigenic determinants occurring in M. leprae and in the human host. We propose that such a similarity on the one hand may facilitate the survival of M. leprae in the human host when the antigens are not recognized as \"non-self,\" a situation which seems to occur in lepromatous leprosy, when the patients' tissues are loaded with bacteria virtually without any immune response. On the other hand, M. leprae antigens which mimic host antigens may induce an auto-immune reaction against the host's own antigens, which could explain the immune reaction in tuberculoid leprosy and during a \"reversal reaction\" when M. leprae is not observed in the host tissues, but extensive granuloma formation occurs.\r"

  ".W": "Distribution of fodrin in the keratinocyte, both in vivo and in vitro, was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In the rat epidermis in vivo, fodrin was localized in the cell periphery of the spinous layer of all the skins studied. In only the basal layer of the thick skin, however, fodrin was seen intensely in the cytoplasm. As in vitro keratinocytes, a mouse cell line (Pam 212) cultured in low (0.06 mM) as well as standard (1.87 mM) Ca2+ was examined. In low Ca2+, fodrin was observed throughout the cytoplasm without marked accumulation irrespective of the cell density. The cytoplasmic labeling in low Ca2+ looked filamentous and became aggregated when cells were treated with cytochalasin B; at least some of the aggregates coexisted with those of F-actin. In contrast, fodrin distribution was not affected with colchicine. On the other hand, in standard Ca2+, the protein became concentrated along the cell periphery and less conspicuous in the cytoplasm as the cells reached confluency. When cells were transferred from low to standard Ca2+, the distribution of fodrin changed accordingly within 180 min. The present results indicate that fodrin in the keratinocyte is likely to be associated with actin filaments and that it takes two different ways of distribution both in vivo and in vitro. The peripheral and the cytoplasmic labeling of in vivo and in vitro cells are likely to correspond. It may be that fodrin changes its localization according to the cell's proliferative activity.\r"

This is done by an earlobe intravenous injection (10 micrograms) of endotoxin followed by an intradermal injection (100 micrograms) of epinephrine in the shaved abdomen; 18-24 h later, a hemorrhagic-necrotic lesion can be observed at the site of the epinephrine injection. The reaction was completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ibuprofen, while allopurinol afforded only partial protection. Thus, oxyradicals seem to participate in the pathogenesis of this reaction.\r"

A striking decrease of CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes, normalizing after chemotherapy, was seen in both patient groups, and was more pronounced in nonimmune patients. A slight increase in interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R)-bearing cells was found in nonimmune patients. In addition, soluble plasma IL-2R was significantly elevated in them (P less than .001) and to a lesser extent in semiimmune patients.

Diverse inducing stimuli, by which the environment interacts with the host cell, trigger the latent viral genome into replication. Experiments are described that led to the identification of a crucial Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene, called ZEBRA, which acts as a switch between latency and replication of this herpes virus. During latency of EBV, ZEBRA expression is repressed. Inducing stimuli cause synthesis of ZEBRA which, in turn, activates expression of several individual EBV early genes. The ZEBRA polypeptide is a site-specific DNA binding protein that is likely to function as a transcriptional transactivator. The recognition that a single viral product may control the latency-to-replication switch offers promise of a detailed understanding of a central process in virology.\r"

These include an improved understanding of the relationship between immunologic parameters and infection, allowing the occurrence of infectious complications to be more predictable; development of prophylactic regimens and chronic suppressive regimens that are effective, well tolerated, and convenient; and emphasis on earlier diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of those infectious processes that are not prevented. These advances have allowed the quality and duration of patient survival to improve during this decade, but they can also be anticipated to alter the spectrum of clinical manifestations that health care providers are going to see during this epidemic's second decade.\r"

Well-characterized serum samples (360) from healthy individuals and patients with EBV or cytomegalovirus infections were examined. The p107 IgG and IgM assays were also tested with serum from 1000 patients with suspected EBV-related disorders. The p107 and polyproline IgG assays were 100% specific for EBV seropositivity. Low p107 IgG titers (less than 1000) were found in 98% of patients with EBV infectious mononucleosis but also in 18% of patients with other diseases. A p107-to-polyproline IgG ratio of less than 1 was 98% specific for EBV infectious mononucleosis; sensitivity was 86%. In EBV capsid antigen-IgG seropositive patients, a p107 IgG titer of less than 1000 together with a p107 IgG-to-IgM ratio of less than 1 was 98% sensitive and specific for EBV infectious mononucleosis. Thus, this ratio appears adequate to measure EBNA antibodies for diagnosis of EBV mononucleosis.\r"

Short-term efficacy was 82% for single-dose and 94% for 7-day treatment (P less than .001). Accumulated efficacy was 71% for single-dose and 87% for 7-day therapy (P less than .001). Fewer adverse reactions were noted with single-dose therapy (not significant). The cure rate for UTI caused by P-fimbriated Escherichia coli was not different from that of other E. coli infections. Infections with Staphylococcus saprophyticus showed a lower cure rate than E. coli infections with the single-dose regimen (P less than .05 for short-term efficacy).\r"

  ".W": "The ability of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) to augment the fungicidal activity of human monocytes for Candida albicans was evaluated. Purified human monocytes cultured with [3H]leucine-labeled C. albicans caused a dose-dependent release of the [3H]leucine. The amount of [3H]leucine released correlated with a decrease in the number of viable yeast colonies. Monocyte cytotoxicity for C. albicans was reduced by superoxide dismutase and catalase and by inhibitors of myeloperoxidase and scavengers of hydroxyl radical and single oxygen, consistent with monocyte candidacidal activity being partly dependent upon products of oxidative metabolism. Monocytes incubated with rhGM-CSF produced more superoxide anion (O2-) spontaneously and after stimulation than control monocytes (P less than .05). Enhanced O2- production was dose-dependent and specific for rhGM-CSF and could be inhibited by antibody to rhGM-CSF. In association with rhGM-CSF-induced production of O2-, the cytokine enhanced cytotoxic activity for C. albicans. These findings indicate that rhGM-CSF stimulates human monocyte fungicidal activity for C. albicans.\r"

Data were additionally analyzed for the incidence of ectopic pregnancy with and without assisted reproductive technology (ART). The incidence of ectopic pregnancy was similar between CC (3.4%) and non-CC (3.4%) treatment groups receiving non-ART treatment. For non-ART treatments, tubal disease and severe endometriosis resulted in an increase in ectopic pregnancies independent of CC use. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy in patients receiving CC + human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) for in vitro fertilization (5.4%) and gamete intrafallopian transfer (3.1%) was similar compared to ART treatments with hMG alone. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy was more closely associated with infertility diagnosis rather than CC use.\r"

The eluate is desalted with Sephadex G25-40, dried, and dissolved in water. A 1 microliters sample is applied to an agarose gel slide. After electrophoresis, the slide is fixed and stained with toluidine blue. The sulfated polysaccharide band(s) is identified by relative electrophoretic migration. The total amount of drug is estimated by matching its optical density with that of a band on one of a set of slides with graded amounts of heparin or dextran sulfate. The reaction with toluidine blue measures the total polyelectrolyte, not just the small proportion of the drug with anticoagulant activity. Pooled normal plasma showed a trace of chondroitin and no heparin. Recovery of heparin and hydrogenated dextran sulfate that was added to pooled normal plasma was complete (lowest concentration tested was 10 micrograms/ml); however, recovery for unhydrogenated dextran sulfate declined consistently by 9 micrograms/ml for concentrations below 50 micrograms/ml, setting a limit for its recovery. Plasma samples taken from patients for coagulation tests were examined by this procedure, and in so doing, steps were ascertained to improve the procedure for routine use. Results were compared with values for prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin times obtained on the same samples by the clinical laboratory. Because the procedure provides an independent parameter for measurement in patients who have received heparin therapy, insight into different patient responses to the drug is therefore possible. With minor modifications, the procedure can be used for heparans, dermatans, and chondroitins, because it allows identification and microscale quantitation on the basis of charge, molecular weight, and carbohydrate structure.\r"

  ".U": "90217817\r", 
  ".W": "Diabetes is thought to be associated with alterations in biliary function involved in a higher prevalence of gallstones in diabetic patients. However, the presence of supersaturated bile in diabetes is still controversial. To gain information on this point, we studied the effect of insulin deficiency on biliary secretion of bile acid, phospholipid, and cholesterol in anesthetized rats. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection (6 mg/100 gm body weight, intraperitoneally). Experiments were carried out at different times (from 1 to 28 days) after diabetes induction. Some rats received insulin (10.5 U/100 gm body weight; divided into five doses) from the third to the sixth day after administration of streptozotocin. Shortly after streptozotocin injection (1 day), bile acid output was decreased but later markedly increased (from 6 days). However, cholestasis was apparent in all insulin-deficient groups. Biliary lecithin concentrations and secretion rate were enhanced from the first day of diabetes. Moreover, an increase in the biliary percentage of lecithin (from 53% to 71% of total biliary phospholipid), which was counterbalanced mainly by a decrease in the biliary concentration of phosphatidylethanolamine, was observed in rats with diabetes for 6 days. Cholesterol concentrations in bile were also higher in diabetic rats. However, the lithogenic index (i.e., percent of cholesterol saturation) was never higher than in healthy rats (55.7%). Cholesterol output induced by taurocholate infusion was not significantly different in control and in 6-days diabetic rats. Nevertheless, biliary lecithin secretion stimulated by taurocholate infusion was markedly increased (the number of lecithin molecules accompanying every 100 molecules of bile acid into bile was 7 and 18 in control and diabetic rats, respectively, at bile acid rates lower than 150 nmol/min per gram liver). Administration of insulin to diabetic rats reversed the above-reported changes. These results indicate that streptozotocin induces profound changes in the mechanisms responsible for bile acid-induced biliary lipid secretion, which are due to the insulin deficiency rather than to a direct hepatotoxic effect of the diabetogenic drug.\r"

  ".W": "Sweat Na+, K+, H+, Cl-, Ca2+, and protein concentrations were reexamined with the use of three methods; namely, in vitro sweat induction from isolated single sweat glands, intradermal methacholine-induced sweating, and thermally induced sweating. [Na+] and [K+] in the primary sweat induced in vitro were nearly isotonic to the bath in both cystic fibrosis (CF) and control. In CF the [Na+] in both proximal ductal and skin surface sweat was always higher than 100 mmol/L. However, [Na+] never reached the isotonic level of 151 mmol/L, even at the highest sweat rate. Thus Na+ absorption never saturates, suggesting that the net NaCl absorption may increase with increasing sweat rate. pH of the primary sweat was 7.13 for CF and 7.29 for control, which corresponds to a [HCO3-] of 7.3 and 10.5 mmol/L, respectively. [Cl-] in the primary sweat was hypertonic (134 mmol/L for CF and 129 mmol/L for control) to the bath (118.4 mmol/L). In CF, ductal acidification of sweat occurred normally during intradermal methacholine-induced sweating, whereas ductal acidification of sweat was much higher in control than in CF in thermally induced sweating. [K+] in CF was higher in the skin surface sweat but not in the proximal duct sweat, suggesting that the predominant site of K+ secretion in CF may be in the distal duct. [K+] in the intradermal methacholine-induced sweat was much higher than that of thermally induced sweat in both CF and control samples. Free but not total [Ca2+] was also increased in CF skin surface sweat. The sweat protein concentration was the same in both CF and control samples. The mechanisms of the different electrolyte concentrations in CF sweat remain to be studied. However, the present observations will provide the basis for future studies on normal and abnormal regulation of membrane transport in CF sweat glands.\r"

The left ventricular (LV) changes at the 1-month study included increases in mass index (85.1 +/- 4.0 g m-2 vs: 76.1 +/- 3.3 g m-2, mean +/- SE; P less than 0.001) and in the pre-ejection period/ejection time ratio (0.46 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.01, P less than 0.001), and decreases in fractional shortening (24.9 +/- 1.0% vs. 27.9 +/- 0.8%, P less than 0.01) and in the peak normalized diameter lengthening rate (2.2 +/- 0.1 s-1 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.1 s-1, P less than 0.01). Four patients developed congestive heart failure. Twenty-four patients were alive and relapse-free 1 year after BMT. The LV measurements were then no longer different from the pre-transplant readings. Thus BMT that is preceded by conditioning with CY and total body irradiation results in increased LV mass and impaired systolic and diastolic LV function. These changes are mostly subclinical, and are also reversible if the recipient survives the initial months after transplantation.\r"

Twenty-two non-obese, middle-aged men with normal blood pressure (n = 11) and untreated mild hypertension (n = 11), respectively, participated in the study. Cholesterol, triglyceride and insulin levels were higher in hypertensive men than in the control group. Glucose disposal was studied as an indicator of insulin sensitivity using the euglycaemic clamp technique. The insulin effect tended to be less marked in men with hypertension. PAI-1 was higher in hypertensive men compared to the controls. A strong positive correlation was observed between PAI-1 and insulin levels as well as blood pressure. PAI-1 and fibrinogen levels correlated negatively with the rate of glucose disposal. Thus, even in these non-obese and mildly hypertensive individuals, an enhanced metabolic risk factor profile for cardiovascular disease was found. The metabolic aberrations were related to elevated fibrinogen and PAI-1 levels which, in turn, increase the risk of thrombus formation.\r"

The purpose of this review is to examine the effect of social support on the development of depression in the caregiver, with a consideration of the components and measurement of social support. The practical as well as the research implications are discussed. Although the anticipated difficulty of caregiving depends on assessment of the elder's mental and functional disability as well, the clinician must not neglect to consider the caregiver's appraisal of the social support available. This assessment need not be elaborate and might include inquiring (1) whether the caregiver has someone in whom to confide; (2) who visits the caregiver, how often, and whether the caregiver is happy with these relationships; (3) what aspects of caregiving are most disturbing; and (4) whether there are symptoms of depression.\r"

  ".W": "In this multicentre study a controlled-release formulation of levodopa and the decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide (Madopar CR) was evaluated in patients with Parkinson's disease exhibiting dose-related fluctuations in motor performance in response to conventional levodopa preparations. The effect of Madopar CR, with or without conventional levodopa/benserazide, on the proportion of time spent \"on\", \"off\" or \"intermediate\" was compared with that of previous conventional levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor therapy. Evaluation of the two periods of optimum therapy was based on both patient diary data and investigator opinion. Forty seven patients completed the study but full patient diaries were available for only 37. The mean optimum total daily dosage of conventional Madopar was 820 mg taken in a mean of 6.4 doses, compared with a mean optimum daily dosage of combined Madopar CR and conventional Madopar of 1088 mg, taken in a mean of 5.2 doses. Conventional Madopar was taken in addition to Madopar CR in all but eight patients. Madopar CR was felt to be advantageous in 83% and disadvantageous in 11% of patients completing the study. Considering the 37 patients for whom diary data were available, Madopar CR therapy resulted in an increase in the mean time spent \"on\" (p = 0.016) and a decrease in the mean time spent \"off\" (p = 0.029) compared with conventional Madopar alone. Individually 25 out of 37 had an increase in \"on\" time and 19 out of 37 experienced a decrease in \"off\" time. Thus Madopar CR was found to be beneficial in a significant proportion of patients experiencing fluctuations in response to conventional levodopa.\r"

Using the degree of carotid stenosis in 500 patients with asymptomatic carotid bruits as a continuous variable, we plotted the frequency distribution and related this to the risk of ischaemic cerebral events and the progression of the arterial lesion. There was a bi-modal distribution, with the junction of the two populations at 85% stenosis. The frequency of ischaemic cerebral events was maximal at 75-90% stenosis. Our data suggest that there is a critical degree of carotid stenosis at which stroke risk becomes maximal. This may represent a window of therapeutic opportunity.\r"

The presence of mammographic abnormalities either benign or suspicious proved to be the only reliable referral criterion (recall rate = 7.9%, recall PV = 3.8%, biopsy call PV = 39%). When mammography was normal the presence of breast complaints other than pain or of a radiologically dense breast were aspecific referral criteria, and since the latter was abandoned, (a) referral rates dropped especially in younger women, (b) referral or biopsy PV improved, whereas (c) cancer detection rate was almost unaffected. Younger age was associated with higher referral rates and with lower PV of both referral or biopsy. Whenever comparison with previous examination was possible, mammography accuracy was higher; this explains the decrease in referral rates and the increased predictivity observed at further rounds with respect to first screening round.\r"

Four hundred and forty-five Cree Indians were examined by one of five neurologists in a complete neurologic examination and by a trained paramedical observer in a short screening examination which included a selection of tests from the complete examination. The screening examinations were recorded on videotape and those for 176 men were reviewed by the five neurologists and the paramedical observer 1 year after the field studies. The prevalence of abnormality assessed in the field screening examination was greater than that assessed during the complete neurologic examination, for neurologic features included in both examinations. However, agreement between examinations in identifying individuals with abnormality was poor with the sensitivity of the screening examination falling under 50% for half of the neurologic features examined. In contrast, specificity was over 80% for 14 of 18 features. Review of the videotapes revealed marked interobserver variation in the assessment of the prevalence of neurologic abnormality and poor agreement with the neurologic examinations in the identification of abnormality in individuals, with kappa less than 0.2 for most neurologic features. The levels of agreement between the neurologic examinations and the screening examinations conducted in the field and by videotape review suggest that neither screening examination provides equivalent information in the identification of the presence of abnormality to that obtained in the neurologic examination.\r"

  ".W": "Angiographically occult vascular malformations can be identified on computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical excision, when possible, is the treatment of choice in symptomatic lesions. Because these malformations are usually small and can be located in surgically treacherous areas of the brain, stereotactic resection should be considered. Stereotactic resection of a pathologically verified occult vascular malformation was performed in 26 patients in this series (13 females and 13 males, mean age 30 years). Seventeen patients presented with a seizure disorder, four with an intracerebral hemorrhage, and four with a progressive neurological deficit; one patient was asymptomatic. Sixteen patients had normal neurological examinations, nine had neurological signs referable to their lesion, and one had a visual field deficit related to a previous temporal lobectomy. In six patients evidence of acute hemorrhage was found on imaging studies or at surgery, and 11 patients had evidence of previous hemorrhage on imaging studies, determined at surgery or by histological examination. Three patients had evidence of both acute and previous hemorrhage and six patients had no evidence of hemorrhage. Lesions were located in cortical or subcortical areas in 21 patients, in the thalamus or basal ganglia in three, and in the posterior fossa in two. Following stereotactic resection, 24 patients were improved, one patient was unchanged, and one patient was worse. Without stereotaxis or intraoperative ultrasound studies, localization of these lesions at conventional craniotomy can be difficult. A stereotactic craniotomy is ideally suited to the treatment of these benign circumscribed, but potentially devastating lesions.\r"

Cell-free subarachnoid clots of autologous plasma in the basal cistern were found to produce no significant reaction of the basilar artery, while whole-blood clots induced a small (15%) chronic constriction after 24 hours. Because the plasma clots were not well retained in the basal cistern, however, small beads (dextran or latex) were added to stabilize them. Injection of beads and plasma led to moderate-to-severe chronic vasoconstriction (35% to 40%) with rapid onset. Control experiments demonstrated that these foreign bodies (beads) alone induced this vascular reaction. Histological examination showed that severe inflammation followed the introduction of subarachnoid beads. The experiments demonstrate that inflammation alone, in the absence of other processes associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage, may induce persistent and severe cerebroarterial constriction and raises the possibility that inflammation in response to subarachnoid blood may play a role in clinical vasospasm.\r"

Compared to nontumor brain tissue, there was greater than a fivefold expression of the sis oncogene in six (40%) of 15 tumors studied and of the c-myc oncogene in 12 (63%) of the total 19 tumors. Expression of the sis gene was lower in the recurrent tumors than in the primary cases, and there was no detectable expression in anaplastic meningioma cells. Rearrangement of the sis gene was found in one meningioma. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22 was detected in two of the five informative heterozygous cases. Expression of the c-myc gene was higher in cases with a loss of heterozygosity than in those without. These results suggest that the sis and c-myc oncogenes are associated with tumorigenicity and that c-myc may induce meningiomas through loss of the putative tumor suppressor gene.\r"

An innovative practical technique and special suture-tying instruments and needle designed by the principal author for this purpose have greatly facilitated this procedure. This technique has been applied to both direct dural closure and dural patching with watertight dural closure. The technique is also widely applicable for closing (or suturing) the dura following any procedure through a small opening, such as the dural tears occasionally encountered during lumbar or cervical discectomy, or tacking the tentorium during a craniotomy. The technique and suture-tying instruments are described in detail.\r"

Discrepancies between 99mTc and 123I images were found in 5%-8% of cases, twice as often in multinodular goiters as in single nodules. Cytologic/histologic examination was performed on all nodules but no correlation was found between the pathology and the type of discrepancy. Twelve carcinomas were found (4%) but none in nodules showing a discrepancy. There was great variation among the observers about the preference for radionuclides and about the existence or type of discrepancies. The slightly better overall quality of 123I scans is probably not of diagnostic significance and does not justify the routine use of 123I instead of 99mTc. Routine reimaging of 99mTc hot nodules with radioiodine for cancer detection does not appear to be necessary.\r"

Within 24 hr, GFR was also determined by two other methods: technetium-99m- (99mTc) DTPA scintigraphic analysis (SA) utilizing a modification of the Gates computer program, and by measuring disappearance of 99mTc-DTPA from whole plasma (WPC) and from protein-free ultrafiltered plasma (PFPC). Determinations of GFR by IC and by PFPC methods were virtually identical (mean absolute error 5.36 ml/min, r = 0.99, p greater than 0.05). GFRs measured in protein-free, ultrafiltered plasma differed significantly from those obtained from whole plasma only in sicker patients and in those taking multiple medications (in whom alterations in protein-binding of DTPA may be seen). The SA method correlated less well with the iodine-125-(125I) IC method than did either the protein-free or whole-plasma clearance methods (mean absolute error 32.36 ml/min, r = 0.74, p less than 0.05).

This is due to the low extraction rate of DTPA, giving an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio, and to the fact that no background area can accurately represent both interstitial and vascular components of the renal curve. Several algorithms have been proposed in the literature for solving the problem of background but their effect on the calculated clearance value has not been sufficiently assessed. In this paper, it has been possible, using a theoretical approach, to predict the respective influence of the different algorithms on the renal clearance. These results were confirmed on the basis of clinical data obtained from 53 renal studies. It was shown that a double background correction, using successively the area ratio method followed by a linear fit method, is probably the most precise method and is less dependent on the choice of the background area.\r"

This is confirmed by factor analysis of dynamic inhalation studies. Assessment of epithelial absorption by urinary excretion of inhaled 99mTc-DTPA is largely independent of aerosol lung deposition. Twenty-four-hour excretion reflects the amount of aerosol cleared by absorption, while two-hour excretion is a quantitative measure of the aerosol absorption rate from the epithelium into blood. Urinary 99mTc-DTPA excretion of two aerosols with different particle size correlated significantly (p less than 0.001) with analysis of lung clearance curves. A very similar regression in the form of a cumulative exponential function was found with both aerosols. Two-hour urine values of nonsmokers differed significantly from those of smokers or patients with active interstitial or infectious lung disease. This alternative procedure is suited as a bedside test and holds promise for patient monitoring and follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of rapid converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) with intravenous enalaprilat on technetium-99m-(99mTc) diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renograms was evaluated in rats with two-kidney, one-clip renovascular hypertension. Rapid sequential DTPA renograms, performed immediately before and five minutes after enalaprilat injection (30 micrograms/kg), demonstrated a selective decrease in clipped kidney DTPA plasma clearance following CEI and no significant effect on unclipped kidney function. Pre- and post-CEI data were obtained with a single injection of DMSA by administering enalaprilat five minutes after the radiopharmaceutical. Enalaprilat slowed the rate of DMSA accumulation in clipped relative to unclipped kidneys, and reduced the clipped/unclipped kidney ratio of absolute DMSA uptake at 10 and 30 min. DTPA and DMSA were equally effective in demonstrating the CEI effect. Enalaprilat was also compared with captopril (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), using sequential DTPA renograms. Clipped kidney DTPA plasma clearance was reduced to an identical degree (40%) by both converting enzyme inhibitors. Clinical renographic protocols can probably be devised to take advantage of the rapid, reliable CEI of enalaprilat, thereby shortening total procedure time.\r"

Nonetheless, disease-model adherents retain a stranglehold on American alcoholism treatment and attack all \"nontraditionalists\" who question their approaches. One such attack by Wallace (1989) is discussed. In addition, Wallace's claim that his treatment program at Edgehill Newport as well as other private treatment centers have remission rates ten times as high as those found for typical hospital treatments is examined critically. Finally, the group of researchers who question at least some elements of the standard wisdom about alcoholism and addiction is found to include nearly every major research figure in the field.\r"

In spite of these studies and reviews of the literature, confusion remains regarding the risk and benefits of the use of benzodiazepines in medical practice. The source of the confusion arises in part from the lack of clarity in the definitions of tolerance, dependence, and addiction. The distinctions among these important terms are frequently obscured in research studies and, especially, in clinical practice. In addition, the practice of separating medical from nonmedical populations in reports of benzodiazepine dependence is misleading. The overlap between medical and nonmedical benzodiazepine users is large, so that many of these individuals fall into both categories. These and other points should be considered as serious questions to the safety and freedom from dependence and addiction in any drug-using population.\r"

They may wake up several times during the night and cannot return to sleep and/or they wake up early in the morning. As a result, they feel sleepy during the day and are less alert. Various forms of insomnia are described that require--as much as possible--an individualized treatment approach. Besides sleeping hygiene, benzodiazepines certainly occupy a place in the treatment of insomnia. Triazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, closely approaches the characteristics of an ideal hypnotic: pharmacological activity at the level of the receptors, moderate absorption, short-acting, and rapid elimination. It is effective and safe if prescribed correctly and at the appropriate dosage.\r"

The primary focus is on how the development of these laws influenced a marked shift in the perception of opiates. Historically, opium and its derivatives have been perceived as efficacious medicines. However, during the past two centuries this perception has shifted to the point that contemporarily the opiates are commonly thought of as a social menace. This perception now outweighs the efficacious medicine perception to a substantial degree. A historical analysis indicates that this shift occurred not so much because the hazardous potential for addiction and overdose was discovered, nor because recreational use became widespread; rather, this shift was greatly influenced by underlying national economic conditions and concerns.\r"

Using a double fluorescence cell-staining technique and analysis of the cells by the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), we have demonstrated that giant cell formation between persistently HIV-1-infected HUT-78 cells and uninfected MOLT-4 cells results in a selective destruction of the uninfected CD4+ MOLT-4 cells. Apparently, bystander CD4+ cells may serve as targets for the killing effect of the HIV-1-infected cells, and this killing effect is preceded by fusion between the target (uninfected) and aggressor (infected) cells. Pentosan polysulfate, dextran sulfate, and various other sulfated polysaccharides, but not heparin, have proved to inhibit this cell fusion process and hence protect the target CD4+ cells against destruction by the killer HIV-1-infected cells. Azidothymidine does not interfere with this process. Assuming that fusion between HIV-infected and uninfected CD4+ cells is a crucial event in the pathogenesis of AIDs, any compounds that specifically interfere with this process may be therapeutically advantageous in the treatment of this disease.\r"

Significant correlations were observed for the HIV group in pairwise comparisons of soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M), neopterin (NEOP), and soluble CD8 (sCD8). CD4 cell levels (number/microliter) in the HIV group showed significant negative correlation with all four serologic markers; CD8 cell levels, in contrast, showed no significant correlation with any serologic activation marker measured. Significant correlations were observed, however, among various cell surface activation markers and serologic activation markers. Specifically, the proportion of CD8 cells expressing CD45RA showed significant negative correlations with NEOP and B2M levels, whereas the proportion of CD8 cells expressing HLA-DR showed significant positive correlations with B2M and sIL-2R levels. Further, the proportion of CD8 cells expressing CD38 showed significant positive correlations with all four serologic activation markers. These findings indicate that sIL-2R, B2M, NEOP, and sCD8 show similar quantitative changes and correlational relationships to CD4 cell destruction in HIV infection; they differ, however, in their relationships to proportional changes in activated CD8 cell subsets.\r"

The assay is simple to perform, and the components are inexpensive. In preliminary testing of a panel of 490 confirmed HIV-1 seropositive specimens, all tested positive by the HIV-1 PHA assay. By testing seroconversion specimens and dilution panels, the assay demonstrated a sensitivity equivalent to a recombinant protein-based HIV-1 enzyme immunoassay (EIA). In-house evaluation of 2,557 HIV-1 prescreened specimens from South African blood bank donors revealed initial and repeat reactive rates of 0.2 and 0.04%, respectively. Field testing of the HIV-1 antibody PHA at two sites gave performance of 100% sensitivity (400 seroconfirmed samples) and 0.55% initial/0.28% repeat reactive rates in the testing of 3,983 negative samples. The performance, low cost, and ease of use make the HIV-1 antibody PHA test a prime candidate for HIV-1 antibody screening in regions of the world where more sophisticated technology is inappropriate.\r"

  ".W": "Diffuse intermediately differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (IDL) is a rare (approximately 2.5%) histologic subtype of malignant lymphoma. We have reviewed the morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features of this disease in 23 patients treated at the National Cancer Institute in the 25-year period between 1963 and 1988. These tumors are uniformly of B-cell origin, but most of them express the T-cell antigen CD5; lambda light chain was expressed nearly twice as frequently as kappa. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years; all patients presented with stage III or IV disease, and the natural history of disease in these patients was heterogeneous. Median survival of patients was more than 5 years, but those with liver involvement documented by biopsy had a significantly shorter survival. No other prognostic factor or combination of prognostic factors significantly affected survival in this small series; however, patients with high expression of the proliferation-associated nuclear antigen Ki-67, absence of cell-surface antigens CD9 and CD10, and blastic morphology appeared to have poorer survival. Treatment was heterogeneous, but patients who achieved a complete response to combination chemotherapy survived longer than patients who failed to achieve a complete response. Only two patients had complete responses lasting longer than 2 years. Unlike patients with follicular lymphoma, those with relapsed IDL did not undergo histologic progression of the disease to an aggressive lymphoma. However, as with patients with follicular lymphoma, it was possible to observe patients with IDL without therapy for periods up to 5 years. Although a significant minority of patients may have very aggressive disease, it appears that, in most patients, IDL behaves similarly to other lymphomas with indolent histology, and thus, an optimal therapeutic approach has not yet been defined.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibody (MAb) B72.3 IgG was radiolabeled with 131I and administered to female athymic NCr-nu mice bearing the LS-174T human colon adenocarcinoma xenograft to determine if fractionation of MAb dose had any advantage in tumor therapy. In the LS-174T xenograft, only approximately 30%-60% of tumor cells express the B72.3-reactive TAG-72 antigen. The LS-174T xenograft was used to reflect the heterogeneity of the TAG-72 antigen often seen in biopsy specimens from patients. In contrast to a single 600-muCi dose of 131I-B72.3 IgG where 60% of the animals died from toxic effects, two 300-muCi doses of 131I-B72.3 IgG (total of 600 muCi) reduced or eliminated tumor growth in 90% of mice, with only 10% of the animals dying from toxic effects. Dose fractionation even permitted escalation of the dose to three doses (each 1 wk apart) of 300 muCi of 131I-B72.3 IgG (for a total of 900 muCi), resulting in even more extensive tumor reduction or elimination and minimal toxic effects. The use of an isotype-matched control MAb revealed a nonspecific component to tumor growth retardation, but the use of the specific B72.3 IgG demonstrated a much greater therapeutic effect. Tumors that had escaped MAb therapy were analyzed for expression of the B72.3-reactive TAG-72 antigen with the use of the immunoperoxidase method; they were shown to have the same antigenic phenotype as the untreated tumors. We verified tumor elimination by killing the test animals after a 7-week observation period and performing histologic examination of tumor sites. We also monitored toxic effects by histologic examination of numerous organs, including bone marrow. These studies thus demonstrate the advantage of dose fractionation of a radiolabeled MAb for tumor therapy. We anticipate that the concept of dose fractionation can be practically applied in radioimmunotherapeutic clinical trials with the development and use of recombinant-chimeric MAbs and modified constructs.\r"

  ".U": "90219133\r", 
  ".W": "As delay in diagnosing unstable cervical spine injuries unnecessarily exposes patients to risk of neurologic injury, it is often recommended that complex radiologic investigations be performed on alert patients with neck pain, tenderness, or neurologic deficit despite normal plain radiographs. The optimal investigation of patients unable to reliably provide such information is less clear. How many X-rays are enough to clear the cervical spine? In order to answer this question, a retrospective review of 775 motor vehicle crash (MVC) victims was conducted. Ninety-two (12%) sustained cervical spine injury. Sixteen of these injuries were missed initially and, in a further 18 cases, the lateral cervical spine X-ray was wrongly interpreted as positive. Fifty-five per cent of patients with cervical injury had a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of less than 15 on admission. Lateral radiographic visualization of the complete cervical spine (including a swimmer's view as required) had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 97%. The addition of open mouth (OM) and anteroposterior (AP) views detected all patients with unstable fractures except one man with a head injury who was unable to provide clinical clues to the diagnosis, but who suffered no additional harm as a result. A single lateral X-ray of the cervical spine is inadequate to exclude cervical spine injury in severely traumatized patients and the addition of OM and AP views still failed to identify unstable fractures in one of 385 patients in this series of MVC victims with GCS less than 15.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed our initial 2-year experience utilizing CT of the abdomen (CTA) in the management of blunt abdominal trauma. Thirty-four of 176 patients (19%) admitted with this diagnosis during 1987-88 underwent CTA as part of their initial evaluation. All patients were hemodynamically stable. Of the 34 CTA's, 15 were negative and the remaining 19 showed positive findings. When the CTA was negative, it was correct in 14 of 15 cases (93%). One case of a perforated jejunum was missed. Of the 19 positive CTA's, 12 cases were treated by observation. The CTA diagnosed a variety of intra- and extraperitoneal injuries which were successfully managed nonoperatively. It, however, missed findings in two cases. Seven of 19 positive CTA cases underwent laparotomy. CTA missed findings in four of these cases. These errors may have been related to the quality of the CTA technique which was subsequently assessed to be suboptimal. When positive, CTA was correct in 13 of 19 cases (68%). The overall accuracy rate was 79% (27 of 34). Subsequent review of the CT scans, however, improved the accuracy rate to 88% (30 of 34). CTA was found to be a valuable adjunct to clinical monitoring in the management of blunt abdominal trauma. However, if the utilization of CTA does not include appropriate patient selection, standardized CTA technique, and accurate radiologic interpretation, there is a significant potential for serious error.\r"

Mice were fed for 2 to 3 weeks with diets containing different types and amounts of fat. They were then subjected to a 20% flame burn and infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Survival in the group fed 40% of total calories as fish oil had significantly higher mortality than those fed safflower oil. This difference was not noted at lower fat levels. Similar groups of animals were sacrificed the day after injection. Splenic macrophage production of PGE2 was significantly lower in the fish-oil group, but production of LTB4 and TXB2 were not affected. In vitro tests of T- and B-cell function were not different amongst groups. We conclude that manipulation of dietary fats can alter outcome in this murine model of infection after thermal injury.\r"

Treatment with the oxygen radical scavengers ascorbic acid, and a combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase had no effect on mortality. We conclude that ascorbic acid, superoxide dismutase, and catalase do not appear to benefit survival after thermal injury and infection in this murine model.

  ".W": "Arteriography and carotid duplex imaging accurately quantify the degree of stenosis caused by carotid atheroma. Since arteriography is inconsistent in identifying carotid ulceration, and controversy exists regarding the diagnostic accuracy of carotid B-mode imaging, a prospective study was performed comparing the two techniques to 126 carotid endarterectomy specimens. Sixty percent (76/126) of specimens contained ulcers. The diagnostic sensitivity for B-mode imaging and arteriography was 47% (36/76) and 53% (40/76), respectively (p = NS). Importantly, the degree of stenosis caused by the plaque significantly affected diagnostic sensitivities. B-mode sensitivity was 77% (10/13) in plaques less than or equal to 50% and 41% (26/63) for plaques greater than 50% (p = 0.03). Arteriography likewise detected 77% (10/13) of ulcers in plaques less than or equal to 50% stenosis and 48% (30/63) in plaques with greater than 50% stenosis (p = 0.07). In patients with focal symptoms, 100% (10/10) of plaques with less than or equal to 50% stenosis contained ulcers, whereas in plaques with greater than 50% stenosis 63% (36/57) contained ulcers (p = 0.02). These data indicate that the diagnostic sensitivity for carotid ulceration is not significantly different between B-mode carotid imaging and arteriography. Since most B-mode errors occur with high-grade stenoses this short-coming is unlikely to adversely affect patient care. Previous studies investigating the ability of carotid B-mode imaging to detect ulceration failed to address quantitative aspects of the carotid plaque. These data appear to resolve the previously existing controversy.\r"

  ".W": "To further characterize the incidence and morbidity of recurrent carotid stenosis, we reviewed 184 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed in a university hospital between August 1983 and January 1988, in patients followed after operation with serial duplex ultrasonography. Recurrent stenosis of greater than 50% diameter reduction developed in eleven arteries (6.0%) at a mean interval of 10.2 +/- 7.8 months. Three of the eleven (1.6% of the total) had associated transient ischemic attack, and none had strokes. Restenosis was significantly more frequent in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients (13.3% vs 4.5%; p less than 0.05); and among patients whose primary stenoses had been symptomatic compared to asymptomatic (11.0% vs 1.5%; p less than 0.02). No statistically significant association with restenosis could be established for gender, hypertension, or smoking. Completion angiography and/or Doppler spectral analysis had been performed, and results were normal at the primary operation in 10 of the 11 patients. Only six of 184 arteries (3.3%) had vein patch closure, but none of these restenosed. Uneventful reoperation with patch closure was performed in three patients with transient ischemic attacks and two with preocclusive restenoses. Lesions were myointimal hyperplasia in four and atheroma in one. Three of the unoperated restenoses have shown regression on duplex scanning, but a fourth progressed to asymptomatic occlusion. Carotid restenosis is uncommon, even without routine use of vein patch angioplasty. Reoperation should be reserved for patients with associated symptoms or greater than 80% restenosis.\r"

The nature of the surgical technique in a field close to the iliac and femoral vessels makes the occurrence of vascular injury an occasional but serious complications. We have reviewed retrospectively our experience of five cases of vascular injuries with total hip replacement and an additional 63 cases in the literature to identify those patients at risk and to define the management of these injuries. For the entire group of 68 patients, most injuries were sustained on the left side (66%), and 39% were seen in revisions. Complications were related to cement incorporation of the iliac vessels (44%), aggressive medial retraction (17%), excessive traction on atherosclerotic vessels (10%), and improper technique in preparation of the acetabulum. The most commonly injured vessels were the external iliac artery (36), common femoral artery (17), and external iliac vein (6). Twenty-seven of these injuries required emergent surgery, most for hemorrhage (66%). Injuries consisted of thromboembolic complications leading to distal ischemia (46%), vessel lacerations (26%), pseudoaneurysms (25%), and arteriovenous fistulas (3%). Vascular repair was individualized and included suture repair, thrombectomy and patch angioplasty, embolectomy, and arterial and venous bypass procedures. There was an overall 7% mortality and a 15% incidence of limb loss. Risk factors include (1) revision procedures, (2) left-sided procedures, and (3) intrapelvic migration of the acetabular component of the hip prosthesis. Elective vascular workup and preliminary retroperitoneal exposure of the iliac vessels at time of hip arthroplasty is recommended for patients at risk.\r"

Untapered 6 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (n = 10) were paired with 4 to 7 mm taper (n = 5) or 7 to 4 mm taper (n = 5) grafts for a 12-week period. Several hemodynamic variables were assessed at multiple locations, and venous intimal-medial thickness was measured at locations corresponding to the hemodynamic measurements. Color Doppler imaging demonstrated energy transfer out of the vessel in the form of perivascular tissue vibration. This was quantitated by the distance required for Doppler signal attenuation or volume of the detected vibration signal. Differences among graft types were noted for pressure, flow velocity, tissue vibration, and venous intimal-medial thickness. Hyperplasia was significantly decreased in 4 to 7 mm taper grafts. Stepwise deletion regression indicated volume of the vibration signal had a better correlation with venous intimal-medial thickness than any other variable (r 0.9, p less than 0.001). We conclude that graft geometry can have a significant impact on hemodynamic factors and venous intimal-medial hyperplasia in arteriovenous loop grafts. Flow disturbances appear to cause energy transfer through the vessel wall and into perivascular tissue. Kinetic energy transfer in the form of perivascular tissue vibration was quantitated in vivo and correlates strongly with venous intimal-medial thickness.\r"

Deep vein thrombosis by venography was present in 77 (49%) of 158 control patients compared with 36 (24%) of 152 patients given intermittent compression. Proximal vein thrombosis was present in 42 controls (27%) compared with 22 patients (14%) given intermittent compression. Combined impedance plethysmography and leg scanning was insensitive in this patient group (sensitivity, 46%); venography was required to detect more than half the patients with venous thrombosis. Sequential intermittent leg compression clinically and statistically significantly reduced the frequency of both proximal vein and calf vein thrombosis. Case finding resulted in early detection and treatment of patients with venous thrombosis.\r"

Although most often caused by parenchymal lung disease, derangements of the ventilatory drive, the respiratory pumping mechanism, or the pulmonary vascular bed may also result in right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation. Arterial hypoxemia (and resultant polycythemia), hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis all contribute to the increased afterload on the right ventricle. Diagnosis is often difficult, since pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale have few specific manifestations, especially early in their evolution. Treatment is primarily directed at the underlying pulmonary or ventilatory disorder, rather than at the right ventricular failure per se. Supplemental oxygen is essential to avoid hypoxia; corticosteroids, anticoagulants, vasodilators, and other specific therapies are used as indicated to treat the underlying pulmonary disorders. When medical therapies fail, lung or heart-lung transplantation has become a possibility for selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "Diuretic drugs have marked effects on lithium clearance. The magnitude and mechanism of the effect depend not only on the site of action of the diuretic but also on the sodium intake of the subject as well. In sodium restricted rats all diuretics except the thiazides increase FeLi and abolish distal lithium uptake. The increase in FeLi produced by proximal and loop diuretics are associated with changes in proximal delivery. Amiloride, on the other hand, increases FeLi solely through inhibition of distal lithium uptake. Therefore, this agent is useful to detect lithium reabsorption beyond the proximal tubule. Additionally the values for FeLi obtained after amiloride administration may provide the best quantitative estimate for proximal delivery in conditions where distal lithium uptake is a consideration. Antidiuretic agents, especially those which potentiate ADH activity, may also have marked effects on lithium clearance. NSAID's and dDAVP are able to significantly reduce FeLi even in sodium loaded animals. As this occurs without a change in proximal delivery, these agents increase lithium reabsorption in distal nephron segments preferentially. Thus, estimates of proximal delivery determined by lithium clearance are not valid in the presence of these agents. Experimental conditions which produce high levels of endogenous ADH or potentiate the action of endogenous ADH may also adversely effect FeLi as a quantitative marker for proximal delivery. Whether there are other drugs which disrupt the ability of lithium clearance to function as a marker for proximal delivery requires further study.\r"

Due to the low affinity of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase for Li+, the transport is most likely energized by exchange and/or cotransport processes. The detailed mechanism by which Li+ is reabsorbed across the proximal tubule is not known, although it seems reasonable to assume that at least a part is by secondary active transcellular transport. The evidence further suggest that aldosterone and maybe vasopressin, through their effects on the Na+ channels in the late distal tubule and the collecting duct may be of significance in inducing distal Li+ reabsorption, as seen during severe sodium restriction in rats and dogs. Clearly more studies are needed to finally resolve these issues.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was carried out in 14 patients with rectal cancer. Tumors were staged preoperatively by endoluminal ultrasonography (EU) and computed tomography (CT). Patients were followed postoperatively for 2 years by the same modalities. Extramural spread was 100% (9/9), accurately assessed by EU and 77.8% (7/9) with CT. Lymph node sensitivity was 87.5% for EU and 37.5 for CT (P less than 0.05). Overall accuracy of lymph node metastases was 85.7% for EU and 57.1% for CT (P less than 0.1). In conclusion, the study shows EU to be statistically more accurate for nodal metastases than CT; therefore, its routine use can be recommended in the preoperative staging of rectal carcinoma in those patients for whom a sphincter-saving procedure is considered.\r"

The presenting symptomatology and the radiological signs were found to be similar to those of gastric carcinoma. Gastroscopy and computed tomography (CT) proved to be effective diagnostic and staging tools. There were two patients of stage I, seven patients of stage II, and three patients of stage IV. Multimodal therapy involving judiciously combined surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy produced early complete remission in all the nine patients with localized disease, and all of them are disease-free at a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. These results are irrespective of whether surgery formed part of the treatment regimen. The relevant literature is reviewed, and the present status of the efficacy of nonsurgical therapy is evaluated.\r"

Among men of predominantly European ethnic origin, 49 with very rapid 2-year declines in CD4+ lymphocyte counts showed significant differences in antigen frequencies from 59 men matched for ethnic background, study centre, and initial CD4+ cell count but with little or no decline in CD4+ cells. Relations of varying strength (odds ratios 6.1-10.3) were seen with several HLA antigens often linked in the A1-Cw7-B8-DR3 haplotype. The strongest relation was with the A1, Cw7, B8 combination (odds ratio 10.3). Associations between these antigen combinations and development of AIDS were weaker. The frequency of HLA A24 was also significantly higher in rapid than in slow decliners (odds ratio 4.3). These findings strengthen the suggested link between the product of a gene in the A1-Cw7-B8-DR3 haplotype and HIV-1-related disease.\r"

The patients were assessed pre-operatively and during the first 5 postoperative days by physical examination, spirometry, blood-gas analysis, and chest radiography. Postoperative pulmonary complications were defined as temperature over 38 degrees C for 2 days, abnormal auscultation, pathological radiography, and/or productive cough. Data from 16 patients per group were analysed. Significantly more patients in the placebo group had three criteria of postoperative pulmonary complication compared with the doxapram group (63% vs 19%).

On admission most patients had nutritional deficiencies. Despite being offered adequate quantities, nutritional requirements were not met during the hospital stay. Clinical outcome was significantly better in the supplemented group (56% favourable course vs 13% in controls) during the stay in the convalescent hospital. The rates of complications and deaths were also significantly lower in supplemented patients (44% vs 87%). 6 months after the fracture the rates of complications and mortality were significantly lower in supplemented patients (40% vs 74%). The median duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the supplemented group (24 vs 40 days). Thus the clinical outcome of elderly patients with femoral neck fracture can be improved by once daily dietary oral supplementation.\r"

  ".W": "With the aim of achieving earlier diagnosis of human, immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in infants, IgA and IgM HIV antibodies in serum samples from babies born to seropositive mothers were assayed by immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after removal of IgG with recombinant protein G. 64 samples were from 38 HIV-infected babies with Centers for Disease Control classifications of P1 or P2. Among these infected children IgA HIV antibodies were present in all 23 samples from those older than 12 months, in 12 of 18 samples from babies aged 6-12 months, in 5 of 10 samples from babies aged 3-5 months, and in 2 of 13 from babies under 3 months old. The 6 IgA-negative samples from infants over 6 months were all from infants with severe AIDS and/or hypogammaglobulinaemia. IgA HIV antibodies were present in twice as many samples as IgM HIV antibodies (66% vs 33%). No IgM or IgA HIV antibodies were detected in infants who subsequently seroreverted or in infants born to seronegative mothers. The correlation of the serological results with clinical information on each child suggests that detection of IgA HIV antibodies is an effective method for early diagnosis of HIV-infected infants without signs of infection.\r"

The median follow-up was 15 months. Survival time for the autolymphocyte group was approximately 2.5 times that for the cimetidine group (p = 0.008). Patients who had greater than 500 pg interleukin-1 (IL-1) per ml autologous lymphokine mixture had a six-fold survival advantage over those with less than 500 pg/ml (p less than 0.00005). Men treated with ALT had a four-fold survival advantage (p = 0.001) over men who received cimetidine only. Infusion of the cultured autolymphocytes was accompanied by mild, self-limited fever in 11 of the 45 ALT patients, and by only one instance in which fever was accompanied by tachypnoea and hypotension.\r"

Recent studies have shown that dystrophin is located at the surface membrane and at the triadic junction, where it is associated with the transverse tubular membrane. Since the triadic junction is the site of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, we have investigated whether intramembrane charge movement, a step in EC coupling, is modified by the absence of dystrophin. Charge movements are thought to arise from the transverse tubular membrane and to underlie the dependence of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release on transverse tubular membrane potential. We find no differences between intramembrane charge movements or passive membrane electrical properties measured in muscles from mdx mice compared with normal mice. If dystrophin does play a role in EC coupling, that role is likely to be subsequent to the charge movement step.\r"

In two instances ultrasound identified fasciculations not apparent on EMG. Analysis of the video images generated quantitative data on fasciculation duration (averaging 500 msec), size, and location and provided unique insight into the process of normal muscle contraction and motor unit physiology.\r"

With electrodiagnostic evaluation, he focused on \"electrocontractility,\" the intensity of muscle contraction elicited by electrical stimulation. Based on his electrophysiologic findings, Duchenne suggested that the responsible lesion resided within the spinal cord. He used electrical stimulation for treatment and recognized prognostic features.\r"

Immunostaining and gold staining of electrophoresis gels were carried out in the investigation. At 5, 25, and 219 days of age, control muscles exhibited dystrophin bands in both the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and the slow-twitch soleus (SOL) muscles. Muscles from the mdx mice at comparable ages (8, 28, and 217 days) never exhibited bands for dystrophin, although titin, nebulin, myosin, and other protein bands were present at intensities comparable to those in control muscles. The dystrophin band was present in both the EDL and SOL from dy2J/dy2J dystrophic mice. As indicated by the present study, the dystrophin deficiency from mdx tissue is not transient. This suggests that dystrophin is not necessary for the success of mdx muscle regeneration.\r"

In an effort to limit the adverse acute and late effects of treatment, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether irradiation of primary sites of involvement could safely be omitted from the treatment of children with localized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Stages I and II) who have a favorable prognosis. In addition, the chemotherapy regimen was less intense and shorter (eight months) than usual. A total of 129 patients were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate) with irradiation (27 Gy) of the involved field (combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy) or chemotherapy alone. Half the patients have been followed for more than 38 months (range, 13 to 68), and the projected disease-free survival (+/- SE) at four years among patients assigned to chemotherapy alone is 87.9 +/- 8.8 percent, as compared with 87.3 +/- 9.4 percent among patients assigned to combined therapy (P = 0.44). The majority of patients tolerated therapy very well, although the toxic effects of treatment (myelosuppression, mucositis, and infection) were significantly worse among patients who received the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We conclude that most children with localized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can be cured by a chemotherapy regimen of reduced intensity and duration. Radiotherapy can be safely omitted from the therapy of such children without substantially jeopardizing their excellent chance of cure.\r"

  ".U": "90220764\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-2 is a major growth factor for activated T lymphocytes, and antibodies reacting with the Tac-chain component of the interleukin-2 receptor can prevent allograft rejection in animals. Because Tac chains are expressed only on a small fraction of activated lymphocytes, monoclonal antibodies against the interleukin-2 receptor may offer a more specific means of immunosuppression than polyclonal antilymphocyte globulin in prophylaxis against graft rejection. Therefore, we compared the immunosuppressive effect of 33B3.1, a rat monoclonal antibody against the human Tac chain, with the effect of a rabbit polyclonal antithymocyte globulin in a randomized study of 100 recipients of first renal transplants. Injections of 33B3.1 (10 mg per day) were tolerated well, whereas major side effects in 15 of 47 patients (32 percent) receiving antithymocyte globulin required discontinuation of treatment before day 14. The incidence of rejection episodes was not statistically different in the two groups at days 14, 30, 60, and 90 after transplantation. Patient and graft survival was also equal in the two groups at one year (96 and 85 percent, respectively, in both groups), and graft function was similar. The total number of infectious episodes within the first three months was lower in the 33B3.1 group than in the antithymocyte group (47 vs. 72). The drop in peripheral-blood lymphocyte concentrations was significantly larger in the patients treated with antithymocyte globulin. The level of circulating Tac-chain-bearing lymphocytes remained below 1 percent during 33B3.1 treatment, as compared with 4 to 5 percent during antithymocyte-globulin treatment (P not significant). We conclude that 33B3.1 is as effective as antithymocyte globulin in the prevention of renal-transplant rejection, and its use results in fewer infections and side effects.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive active absorption of sodium is a unique abnormality of the airway epithelium in patients with cystic fibrosis. This defect is associated with thickened mucus and poor clearance of airway secretions and may contribute to the pulmonary disease in these patients. To study whether the inhibition of excessive absorption of sodium might affect the course of lung disease in cystic fibrosis, we performed a double-blind, crossover trial comparing aerosolized amiloride (5 mmol per liter; 3.5 ml four times daily), a sodium-channel blocker, with vehicle alone. Fourteen of the 18 adult patients initially enrolled in the study completed the one-year trial (25 weeks for each treatment). The mean (+/- SEM) loss of forced vital capacity (FVC) was reduced from 3.39 +/- 1.13 ml per day during treatment with vehicle alone to 1.44 +/- 0.67 ml per day during treatment with amiloride (P less than 0.04). A measured index of sputum viscosity and elasticity was abnormal during treatment with vehicle alone and improved during treatment with amiloride. Calculated indexes of mucociliary and cough clearance also improved during amiloride treatment. No systemic, respiratory, or subjective toxic effects of amiloride were noted. We conclude from this preliminary study that aerosolized amiloride can be safely administered to adults with cystic fibrosis. The slowing of the loss of FVC and the improvement in sputum viscosity and elasticity suggest a beneficial clinical effect. Aerosolized amiloride deserves further evaluation in the treatment of lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

Clinicians should view assessment instruments as they would any other clinical test. They should be familiar with the strengths, weaknesses, and precision of any test used and understand how best to use the test as an adjunct to clinical practice. In addition, clinicians must learn to focus on functional status, in terms of both assessment and outcome, in their care of older patients.\r"

We performed a randomized, double-blind trial comparing a shorter course of continuous intravenous heparin (5 days, with warfarin sodium begun on the first day) with the conventional 10-day course of heparin (with warfarin sodium begun on the fifth day) in the initial treatment of 199 patients with acute proximal venous thrombosis documented by venography. The frequency of objectively documented recurrent venous thromboembolism was low and essentially the same in the two groups (7.1 percent in the short-course group vs. 7.0 percent in the long-course group). Because the observed difference between the groups was 0.1 percent in favor of the long-course group, it is unlikely (P less than 0.05) that a true difference in favor of this group would be greater than 7.5 percent; the difference could be as much as 7.3 percent in favor of the short-course group. Major bleeding episodes were infrequent, and the rate was similar in both groups. We conclude that a five-day course of heparin is as effective as a 10-day course in treating deep venous thrombosis. Furthermore, using the shorter course would permit earlier discharge from the hospital and thus offer substantial cost savings.\r"

The maximal tolerated dose of THA (up to 100 mg per day) was determined during an eight-week titration period, after which the tolerated dose of THA or placebo was given during two sequential randomized periods of treatment lasting eight weeks each. Highly purified lecithin (4.7 g per day) was administered during all phases of the study. Efficacy was expressed in terms of scores on the Mini-Mental State (MMS) test, the modified MMS test, the Hierarchic Dementia Scale, the Rapid Disability Rating Scale-II, and the behavioral scale of Reisberg et al. Safety was assessed by careful clinical monitoring as well as serial measurements of liver aminotransferases. Forty-six patients completed the titration period, and 39 completed the double-blind period, during which only the MMS score showed a small but significant increase (P less than 0.05) after four weeks of treatment with THA. Autonomic side effects of THA were common but mild. Reversible elevations of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels to three or more times the upper limit of normal occurred in 17 percent of patients; most of the patients affected were women. A liver biopsy performed in one patient showed resolving focal liver-cell necrosis. These studies fail to demonstrate a significant clinical benefit of THA given orally in a maximal dose of 100 mg per day over a period of eight weeks in combination with lecithin.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular mass sometimes decreases during treatment of hypertension, but this response is inconsistent and its effects on left ventricular function are unknown. In a six-month randomized trial, we studied the ability of verapamil and atenolol to reduce left ventricular mass in 42 elderly patients with hypertension and the effects of this reduction in mass on cardiac function. The mean blood pressure (+/- SE) decreased in both the group that received verapamil (from 171.4 +/- 3.2/93.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg to 142.9 +/- 2.8/79.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg) and the group that received atenolol (from 179.6 +/- 4.6/98.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg to 148.1 +/- 3.3/83.4 +/- 1.2 mm Hg), but the atenolol-treated patients more frequently required the addition of chlorthalidone to achieve blood-pressure reduction (P less than 0.01). Verapamil resulted in a reduction in the left-ventricular-mass index from 104 +/- 5 g per square meter of body-surface area to 85 +/- 5 g per square meter (P less than 0.01). Atenolol did not produce a reduction in the left-ventricular-mass index (109 +/- 9 g per square meter before treatment vs. 112 +/- 10 g per square meter after treatment). Two weeks after the withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, blood pressure returned to pretreatment values. Nevertheless, in patients whose left ventricular mass had decreased, two measures of diastolic filling, the peak diastolic filling rate to the peak ejection rate, were significantly higher than before treatment (2.42 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.31 +/- 0.4 [P less than 0.05] and 0.61 +/- 0.03 to 0.85 +/- 0.05 [P less than 0.05], respectively). Diastolic filling was unchanged in the group that had no reduction in left ventricular mass. Cardiac output and the ejection fraction at rest and during mild exercise were unchanged in both groups as compared with baseline values. We conclude that left ventricular mass can be reduced in elderly patients with hypertension and mild ventricular hypertrophy who receive antihypertensive therapy. Reduction occurs more frequently with verapamil than with atenolol therapy, increases diastolic filling, and does not impair systolic function.\r"
