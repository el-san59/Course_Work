  ".W": "Hemoglobin distribution width (HDW) is a measurement of the heterogeneity of the red cell hemoglobin concentration as determined by the Technicon H1 automatic counter. The utility of this measurement for patients with sickle cell disease was assessed in 275 samples from 61 patients. We found that patients with sickle cell disease in steady state had an elevated HDW (3.89 +/- 0.82 gm/dl) compared with the normal range of 2.2 to 3.2 gm/dl, and that this value correlated strongly with the number of dense red cells (r = 0.72, p less than 1 x 10(-10]. When HDW was determined daily for patients with SS in painful crisis, the decline in dense cells observed during this event was paralleled by a decrease in HDW. The percent of dense cells fell from steady state levels of 10.0% +/- 9.5% to 5.7% +/- 4.9% at the beginning (days 1 through 3) to 3.1% +/- 2.0% at the end of painful crisis (days 6 through 9). HDW decreased from the steady state value of 3.89 +/- 0.82 gm/dl to 3.44 +/- 0.73 gm/dl at the beginning of crisis and fell further to 3.14 +/- 0.40 gm/dl at the end. We conclude that HDW is a rapid and reliable assessment of the percent of dense cells in sickle cell disease and is a useful objective parameter to follow in sickle cell crisis.\r"

We also perturbed rat lung glutathione concentrations by administering the compound diisopropylidene acetone (phorone) to a separate group of animals and correlated changes in BALF glutathione with changes in lung tissue glutathione. We found that reduced glutathione is present in normal rat BALF but glutathione disulfide is extremely low. Increases in lung tissue glutathione concentration and in BALF glutathione concentration occurred after 5 days of exposure to hyperoxia. Animals treated with phorone exhibited decreases in lung glutathione concentration two hours after dosing and increases in lung glutathione concentration 24 hours after dosing. Rat BALF obtained from phorone-treated animals at 2 or 24 hours after administration revealed that changes in BALF glutathione concentrations reflected changes in lung tissue glutathione concentration. The presence of glutathione in lung lavage fluid suggests that the compound could be playing an extracellular role in the lung, either as an antioxidant or as a coenzyme for other glutathione-related enzymatic reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperoxaluria occurs with many gastrointestinal disorders complicated by malabsorption. This hyperoxaluria is known to be the result of increased colonic absorption of dietary oxalate. Proposed mechanisms for this effect include alterations in fecal fatty acids, alterations in fecal bile acids, and acidification of colonic pH. Using an animal model of lactulose-induced chronic colonic acidification, we examined the effect of pH on oxalate absorption in vivo. Rats were fed a diet containing 6.77 mg oxalate per day with and without lactulose. Cecal pH of the animals receiving lactulose was significantly lower than controls (4.90 +/- 0.42 vs 7.17 +/- 0.38; p less than 0.001). Urinary excretion of oxalate was significantly greater in animals receiving the lactulose diet than in controls (0.975 +/- 0.144 vs 0.844 +/- 0.172 mg oxalate per day; p less than 0.001). These results demonstrate that acidification of the colon results in a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion. Thus, acidification of the colon may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of enteric hyperoxaluria.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is an effective long-term treatment for renal failure. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is a rare but devastating complication of CAPD and may be caused by long-term peritoneal antiseptic exposure. We examined the peritoneal injury resulting from daily inoculations of moderately high concentrations of the following antiseptics: povidone-iodine, Dakin's solution, Amuchina, and Ampercide. After 4, 8, and 12 weeks of daily intraperitoneal injections in rats, a 10% solution of povidone-iodine in dialysis fluid caused a condition that mirrors human SEP. Animals had poor early weight gain, and gross necropsy examination revealed intestinal adhesions and a mesothelium that was sclerotically thickened. From 4 to 8 weeks the 10% povidone-iodine-injected animals showed progressive conditions and the prevalence of multiple encapsulating adhesions increased from 0/6 to 4/4, p = 0.005. Marked visceral mesothelial thickening in the 10% povidone-iodine-injected animals was quantitated after 4, 8, and 12 weeks at 92.0 +/- 11.6, 151.5 +/- 28.8, and 206.0 +/- 36.2 micron, respectively. Rats injected with dialysis fluid (controls) had normal-appearing mesothelial surfaces measured at 1.8 +/- 0.2, 2.4 +/- 0.2, and 2.2 +/- 0.2 micron after 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively. The marked thickening of the mesothelium in the 10% povidone-iodine group compared with the controls was highly significant, p less than 10(-8). We conclude that povidone-iodine, the most commonly used antiseptic in CAPD, caused severe tissue injury, whereas other antiseptic solutions, Dakin's, Amuchina, and Ampercide, at the similar dilution did not appear to cause mesothelial injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88316030\r", 
  ".W": "It is widely believed that skeletal resistance is the mechanism of impaired calcemic response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) in renal failure. The action of PTH not only involves skeletal mobilization of Ca, it may also stimulate intestinal absorption of Ca and renal conservation of Ca. We have examined each of these factors and studied the calcemic response to PTH in renal failure. PTH, 3 U/hr/100 gm, was infused for 5 hours in rats with renal failure 3 weeks after a five-sixths nephrectomy. In nonfasted animals, the post-PTH increments of total plasma Ca (0.71 +/- 0.06 mg/dl) and ionized Ca (0.37 +/- 0.06 mg/dl) of control sham-operated rats were significantly greater than those of rats with renal failure (plasma Ca 0.37 +/- 0.02 mg/dl and plasma ionized Ca 0.17 +/- 0.01 mg/dl both p less than 0.001). Urinary Ca excretion rate remained unchanged during PTH infusion despite the increase in plasma Ca. Plasma levels of calcitriol after PTH injection were higher in control rats (257 +/- 18 pg/ml) than in rats with renal failure (162 +/- 5 pg/ml, p less than 0.001). Pretreatment of rats with renal failure with 50 ng calcitriol intravenously corrected the abnormal calcemic response to PTH. To exclude the PTH effect on intestinal Ca absorption, PTH infusion was carried out in animals fasted for 18 hours. The post-PTH increments of Ca were no longer different between rats with renal failure (plasma Ca 0.37 +/- 0.04 mg/dl, plasma ionized Ca 0.20 +/- 0.01 mg/dl) and control rats (plasma Ca 0.37 +/- 0.03 mg/dl, plasma ionized Ca 0.19 +/- 0.01), suggesting that skeletal mobilization of Ca was similar between the two groups of animals. We conclude that lack of intestinal response to PTH rather than skeletal resistance was the mechanism of impaired calcemic response to PTH in this model of renal failure.\r"

Metastatic deposits from various distant organs such as the lung, breast and kidney can occur in the mastoid bone (Schucknecht, 1968). Invasive tumours can spread to the mastoid bone from adjacent areas such as neoplasms of the parotid and cranium.\r"

  ".W": "The cholesterol granuloma is a particular form of granulation tissue developing as part of a variety of tissue reactions, Cholesterol granuloma is not related to cholesteatoma which may be regarded as an epidermoid cyst of the middle ear or temporal bone. Cholesterol granulomas are rarely associated with such cases (Friedmann, 1976; Gherini et al., 1985). Microscopically, the cholesterol granuloma consists of dense masses of cholesterol crystals which appear as clefts. They are surrounded by foreign body giant cells, foam cells, plasma cells and lymphocytes. There is frequently some fresh blood and some blood pigment (Wilhelm, 1977; Beales, 1979; Gibb, 1979). It seems probable that inflammation and prolonged obstruction of a bony cavity that is normally aerated, are the main ways in which cholesterol is concentrated in the paranasal sinuses. It could be expected to be relatively frequent in the maxillary and frontal sinus, but only a few cases have been reported in the literature and only nine cases affecting the maxillary sinus have been published over the last 22 years (Milton and Bickerton, 1986). We have recently found a cholesterol granuloma arising in the maxillary antrum.\r"

  ".W": "The impact of the counselor in substance abuse rehabilitation has been questioned. The unexpected resignations of two counselors provided a natural opportunity to examine the effects of counselor assignment in a methadone maintenance treatment program with the effects of the medication philosophy, program rules, and supplementary services held constant. Sixty-one patients who had been assigned to these two counselors were assigned to four other counselors in a virtually random manner. It was reasoned that if the new counselor had relatively little impact, then there would be little difference in performance from pre to posttransfer or among the four caseloads during the 6-month period following the transfer. Performance measures included urinalysis results, methadone dosage, prescriptions for psychotropic medications, employment, and arrest rates. Results indicated statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences in the posttransfer performance of the four caseloads. One counselor significantly reduced the average methadone dose of his/her caseload as well as the number of patients prescribed ancillary medications, while concurrently reducing positive urine tests, unemployment and arrests. In contrast, another counselor significantly increased the average methadone dose in his/her caseload but still showed increases in positive urine tests and unemployment. As has been found in prior studies, background and formal education differences among the counselors were not related to the observed performance differences. However, differences in the content and process of counseling among the counselors were associated with the differences in patient outcome. These process differences are discussed in relation to earlier studies of professional psychotherapy.\r"

Its prevalence and descriptive validity among psychiatric patients have not been investigated. These two aspects of SD are examined by comparing it with depressive and anxiety disorders, both of which include somatic symptoms and often are confounded with it. A semistructured evaluation procedure applied in a naturalistic clinical setting yielded a diagnosis and ratings of a large array of symptoms. The relative rarity of SD stands out, as well as the unique way in which it tends to be used in diagnostic formulations of psychiatric patients seeking evaluation and care. These results may reflect these patients' reluctance to seek psychiatric care and to define their problems as mental, as well as the bias of clinicians working in psychiatric settings geared to looking for traditional psychopathology. The distinguishing symptoms of SD vis-a-vis depressive and anxiety syndromes are outlined. These symptoms suggest that SD patients resemble depressives, but harbor traits that reflect personality and interpersonal difficulties. However, rater bias may have influenced these results as well.\r"

Prevalence rates of 2.8%, 1.2%, and 0.2% were found for phobias related to writing, eating, and use of public restrooms, respectively. Social phobias were more common among women than men.

Further analyses of a representative subsample of 10 patients who continued to receive placebo revealed that the placebo response was maintained and even increased at the end of 10 weeks when 20% to 30% of the patients could be classified as marked responders on key panic and phobic measures. Results also revealed an interesting observation that most of the improvement in panic, anxiety, and depression occurred early whereas improvement in phobic measures was more gradual and increased significantly over time.

At 12 years, the estimated probability of survival is 65.0%, and the estimated probability of relapse-free survival for complete responders is 83.5%. Long-term complications, such as clinically significant organ toxicity or therapy-related second malignancies, have not been observed. The functional status of survivors is maintained, with 95% returning to their pretherapy status, of which 88% are fully employed. Of patients receiving chemotherapy without abdominal surgery, 35% have fathered healthy children posttherapy. Achievement of complete remission (CR) in disseminated germ cell tumors with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy translates to long-term disease-free survival and cure for the majority of patients, with preservation of functional status.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study is to draw attention to important points concerning the clinical management of late relapses in testicular cancer. From 1972 to 1982 The Norwegian Radium Hospital (NRH) has treated 1,008 patients with testicular cancer. Fifteen (1.5%) of these patients relapsed 36 months or more after their primary treatment. The patients' medical records were reviewed in this retrospective study, and all available histological sections were reevaluated. Six patients had pure seminoma initially and relapsed after an average of 54.5 months. Five of them had subjective symptoms due to recurrent tumor. Four patients relapsing in the supradiaphragmatic lymph nodes only are alive with no evidence of disease after an observation time of 17 to 30 months after treatment. Nine nonseminoma patients relapsed after an average of 85 months (36 to 194 months). Eight of these were aware of subjective signs or symptoms due to recurrent tumor leading to the diagnosis of the relapse. Four of these patients are alive with no evidence of disease after an observation time of 4 to 46 months after treatment. Two of these patients relapsed with pure mature teratoma. Late relapses do occur although they are rare events. Seminoma patients relapsing in the lymph nodes only have a good prognosis, and nonseminoma patients have a slightly poorer prognosis. Active follow-up for relapse detection is not justified. All testicular cancer patients should instead be informed of typical signs and symptoms that can be related to a relapse and encouraged to seek medical help for further investigation.\r"

Twelve elderly patients were administered VM26 as first-line chemotherapy. Toxicity was manageable, myelosuppression being the major side effect. The response rate for 44 evaluable patients was 34% (36% for untreated patients); the median durations of response and survival were 230 and 208 days, respectively. Effectiveness of prior chemotherapy and time from last administration was found to influence patient response to VM26: 42% of responders to prior chemotherapy responded to VM26, while 0% of the nonresponders to prior chemotherapy responded to the new agent. Moreover, among patients pretreated with chemotherapy, 12% of those recently treated (earlier chemotherapy ending less than or equal to 2.6 months before administration of VM26) responded to VM26, while 53% of patients treated greater than 2.6 months earlier responded to VM26. Survival was influenced by common prognostic factors (performance status, weight loss, prior chemotherapy exposure). Selection of pretreated patients by type of exposure to prior chemotherapy may help in the testing of new drugs in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "We identified eight patients with skeletal complications associated with hairy cell leukemia (HCL). The median time from diagnosis of HCL to the diagnosis of skeletal complications was 20 months (range, 0 to 93). All patients complained of pain and all but one lesion were located in the axial skeleton, primarily the proximal femur. Lytic lesions were seen on radiographic examination in all but one patient, and one patient additionally had multiple osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Radionuclide technetium bone scan was abnormal in all patients examined. Although the peripheral blood counts were variable (only two patients had a leukemic phase of the disease), all patients examined had a hypercellular bone marrow biopsy with hairy cells comprising at least 90% of the hematopoietic elements. The skeletal abnormalities responded well to local radiation therapy. Seven patients were begun on systemic therapy with interferon alpha-2b after the diagnosis of the skeletal lesion. Four of five evaluable patients had a partial hematological response and a substantial improvement in the degree of hairy cell infiltration of the bone marrow. None of these patients has had a recurrence of skeletal complications at a median follow-up time of 29 months. One patient failed to respond hematologically and developed additional bone lesions after 1 year of treatment. Another patient developed a new skeletal lesion 3 months after the cessation of interferon therapy at which time the bone marrow was essentially packed with hairy cells. This retrospective study indicates that bone involvement is a rare complication of HCL and is associated with a high tumor burden in the bone marrow. In addition to local radiation therapy, systemic treatment with interferon should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "The reported experience with Hodgkin's disease (HD) in the United States has come primarily from large referral centers that attract a predominantly white population of high socioeconomic status (SES). The majority of these patients had the nodular sclerosis (NS) histologic subtype and asymptomatic stage I/II disease. We have reviewed the records of 178 patients with HD seen within the past 17 years at Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center (LAC/USC), which is a nonreferral, government-operated facility. Our patient population was found to be heterogeneous, with 38% white, 22% black, and 36% Hispanic. Systemic \"B\" symptoms were noted in 62% of patients at diagnosis, and 63% had advanced disease (stage III or IV). NS pathologic subtype was present in only 52% of the group. Comparison between the races revealed: (1) Hispanics had a higher incidence of lymphocyte depleted subtype and less NS than whites (P less than .06); (2) whites had equal distribution between stages I/II and III/IV; (3) blacks and Hispanics presented more frequently with stage III/IV (P = .10); and (4) extranodal involvement occurred most often in bone in whites, and was equally distributed between liver, lung, and bone in blacks and Hispanics. We conclude that the lower SES, mixed racial population seen at our institution more closely resembles the reports of HD in Third-World countries and is characterized by advanced symptomatic disease. Further, the clinical pathologic characteristics of HD in the United States may vary significantly, depending upon the precise ethnic and socioeconomic status of the patients being served.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred two adult patients with stage III1A (76 patients) and stage III1B (26 patients) Hodgkin's disease were treated with two cycles of mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) and radiotherapy (XRT) between 1970 and 1984. Sixty-four of the patients were treated between 1970 and 1978 with two cycles of MOPP and XRT to the mantle, upper abdomen, and pelvis. The remaining 38 patients were treated from 1978 to 1984 with a modification of the protocol in which pelvic XRT was omitted and low-dose whole-lung XRT was administered to patients with unfavorable mediastinal disease. The 10-year actuarial freedom-from-progression (FFP) and determinate survival rates at a mean follow-up of 93 months were 84% and 86% for stage III1 disease, 86% and 84% for stage III1A disease, and 78% and 91% for stage III1B disease. Three patients died of treatment-related toxicities without evidence of Hodgkin's disease, two died of complications of myelosuppression and one of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Neither FFP nor determinate survival rates were significantly influenced by B symptoms, unfavorable mediastinal disease, histologic subtype, extent of abdominal disease, the omission of pelvic XRT, the use of whole-lung XRT, or the number of splenic nodules. Patients 40 years of age or older had a 73% determinate survival rate at 10 years compared with 88% for patients younger than 40 years (P = .01). This survival difference was due to treatment-related toxicity in the older group. This study indicates that two cycles of MOPP and XRT to the mantle and upper abdomen is as effective as more intensive treatment for all patients with stage III1 Hodgkin's disease. This treatment program can preserve fertility and has had only a 1% actuarial incidence of ANLL at 15 years.\r"

Body weight was found to be significantly related to doxorubicin clearance (r = -.75; P less than .001) and elimination half-life (r = .62; P = .003). Thus, the contribution of obesity on pharmacokinetics of antineoplastic agents should be taken into consideration in the analysis of clinical data with respect to toxicity and tumor response. Twenty-one patients were studied with their first course of doxorubicin (50 to 70 mg/m2) administered as a 60-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of percentage of ideal body weight (IBW): normal (less than 115% IBW), mildly obese (115% to 130% IBW), and obese (greater than 130% IBW). Blood samples were collected up to 48 hours after the infusion and analyzed for doxorubicin and its metabolite, doxorubicinol, by high performance liquid chromatography. Doxorubicin area under the curve (AUC) was greater in obese than in normal patients (2,209 v 1,190 ng h/mL; P less than .05), yielding correspondingly reduced systemic clearance of the agent in obese patients (891 v 1,569 mL/min; P less than .001). The mean elimination half-life (T1/2) was 20.4 hours in the obese patients and 13.0 hours in the normal patients. The apparent volume of distribution (Vss) was not significantly different among the three groups of patients, indicating that the prolonged T1/2 in the obese patients is due to the reduction in clearance. The AUC and T1/2 of doxorubicinol were similar among all patient groups.\r"

  ".W": "We report a phase I clinical investigation of 30-minute and four-hour intravenous (IV) infusions of recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF)-alpha. Thirty-nine patients with disseminated cancer received escalating doses of rTNF-alpha for five consecutive days every 2 weeks for a total duration of 8 weeks. Dose escalations followed a modified Fibonacci scale with a minimum of four patients entered at each dose level: 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 250 micrograms/m2/d. Toxicities consisted mainly of constitutional symptoms including fever, chills, headache, and fatigue, increasing in severity with dose escalation. No significant differences in dose-limiting toxicities were seen between the two rates of IV infusion. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 200 micrograms/m2 with dose limiting toxicity being constitutional symptoms and hypotension. Hematologic changes included median decrease in both granulocyte and platelet counts of 38% and 41%, respectively (range, 16% to 85%), although clinically significant granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were not observed. Hematological parameters returned to baseline within 72 hours after rTNF-alpha was stopped. rTNF-alpha induced changes in lipid metabolism were manifested by median fasting triglyceride elevations above baseline (median, 103 micrograms/dL) of 157% (range, 16% to 389%) after five days of therapy with doses greater than 75 micrograms/m2, associated with a median increase in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) of 80%. Serum rTNF peak levels exceeding 10 ng/mL were observed 30 minutes following rTNF-alpha infusions at MTD dose. Twelve of 34 patients had no change in their evaluable disease for a median duration of 18 weeks (range, 8 to 30 weeks), and 22 patients showed progressive disease. This study forms the framework for phase II trials of IV administered rTNF-alpha.\r"

IPG was performed at Day 0 and, if abnormal, contrast venography was also performed to rule out a falsely positive result. Patients with an initially normal IPG had the test repeated at Days 1, 3, 5 to 7, and 10 to 14. Contrast venography was not performed and anticoagulant treatment was withheld in all patients who remained normal during repeated IPG testing. Technetium-99m RBC venography was performed at Day 0 in patients with an initially abnormal IPG and during the period of serial IPG testing in those with an initially normal IPG. The sensitivity of [99mTc]RBC venography for proximal DVT was 0.68, with 95% confidence limits (CL) from 0.48 to 0.89. Specificity was 0.88 (95% CL from 0.81 to 0.95). When the findings of [99mTc]RBC venography for the entire lower extremity were compared to the reference method, the sensitivity increased to 0.90 (95% CL from 0.82 to 0.97) but the specificity decreased to 0.56 (95% CL from 0.51 to 0.62). Technetium-99m RBC venography is a sensitive but less specific method for detecting DVT of the entire lower extremity. An abnormal [99mTc]RBC venogram, particularly in the calf region, should always be confirmed by another diagnostic method.\r"

The mean number of children in the DCCs was 223; the diarrhea rate during the first 12 months was 2.62 episodes per child-year. Rotavirus accounted for approximately 10% of the total episodes of diarrhea in the pediatric clinic and DCC populations, but 50% during the winter months. The occurrence of RV in the DCCs paralleled that seen in the pediatric clinic. The annual rate of RV infection in DCCs was 0.55 episodes per child-year, with diarrhea occurring in only 40% of the episodes (0.22 episodes per child-year). There were 45 diarrhea outbreaks in DCCs, for a mean of 3.8 per center per year; nine of these outbreaks were associated with RV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA genome patterns of RV strains from eight of these outbreaks showed that in seven outbreaks a single strain was identified in children in that DCC, whereas multiple strains were identified simultaneously in the community. The age distributions of symptomatic and asymptomatic RV infections in DCC study children were not significantly different. In symptomatic RV-infected children in DCCs, 42% had RV identified in stool specimens within 2 days before diarrhea occurred. Thirty-eight DCC children had more than one episode of RV infection, but only five had two symptomatic RV infections. Diarrhea caused by RV is common in children in DCCs, often occurs in outbreaks due to the same strain, and parallels disease in the community; asymptomatic RV infection is also common in children in DCCs.\r"

Intraurethral and circumferential glans cultures were obtained from 25 circumcised and 25 uncircumcised infants at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 months of age. Different children were used at each age (300 total). The types of bacteria and the total and specific colony counts were compared. The results of the glans cultures were similar to those from the urethra. Uncircumcised boys had significantly higher total colony counts (p less than 0.003) at all ages except 12 months. Escherichia coli was present significantly more often (p less than 0.01) in the urethras of uncircumcised boys at 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. Gram-negative uropathogenic organisms (Klebsiella-enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were cultured more frequently (p less than 0.0005) from the urethras of uncircumcised boys at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. The specific colony counts for E. coli and the other uropathogenic organisms were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) at all ages except 12 months. We conclude that during the first 6 months of life, the presence of a foreskin is associated with a greater quantity of periurethral bacteria and a greater likelihood for the presence of, as well as higher concentrations of, potentially uropathogenic organisms.\r"

Egg, milk, and peanut accounted for 78% of the positive reactions. As in previous studies, patients developed skin (96%), respiratory (52%), or gastrointestinal (30%) symptoms during the challenge. These studies indicate that children who have atopic dermatitis unresponsive to routine therapy or who continue to need daily treatment after several months would benefit from evaluation for food hypersensitivity.\r"

Metabolic balance studies were conducted in the study group during an initial 48 hours (period 1) and on days 6 and 7 after admission (period 2). The control group was studied after recovery from respiratory disease. Copper and zinc content of feces, urine, and food samples was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Mean (+/- SD) fecal losses were higher for period 1 in the diarrhea group than in control subjects: Cu 55.7 +/- 21.2 versus 28.8 +/- 6.7 micrograms/kg/body weight/day (p less than 0.01); Zn 159.4 +/- 59.9 versus 47.4 +/- 6.4 micrograms/kg/day (p less than 0.0001). For period 2, Zn losses were similar in both groups, but Cu balance remained negative only in the study group. Retention of Zn for the study group went from -21.2 +/- 46.7 in period 1 to 204.5 +/- 103.0 micrograms/kg/day in period 2 (p less than 0.0001), and fecal weight decreased from 70.5 +/- 20.6 in period 1 to 36.8 +/- 20.0 gm/kg/day in period 2. Fecal weight and fecal losses were correlated: r = 0.71 (p less than 0.01) for Cu and r = 0.81 (p less than 0.001) for Zn. Plasma mean Cu and Zn levels were low in period 1 but rose in period 2, especially for Zn. A negative correlation was found between fecal Zn losses and plasma Zn: r = 0.74 (p less than 0.001). We conclude that acute diarrhea leads to Cu and Zn depletion and that plasma levels and Cu balance remain abnormal a week after admission.\r"

The success rate was significantly lower in younger patients. Hemodynamic status, respiratory status, and level of expertise of the individual performing catheterization did not affect success rate. Most of the failures (six of eight) were related to presumed thrombosis from prior cannulation of the superior vena cava. Mean duration of catheterization was 7.5 +/- 5.8 days (+/- SD). Minor complications (n = 24) included hematomas, minor bleeding from subclavian artery puncture, and transient premature ventricular ectopic beats. Major complications (n = 6) were pneumothoraces (n = 4) and catheter-related infection (n = 2). The number of attempts made to catheterize the vessel and the level of expertise of the operator had the greatest effect on complication rates. No mortality was associated with this procedure. We have found percutaneous infraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization to be a rapid alternative to surgical cutdown for venous access during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Pediatric residents can be trained, under direct supervision, to perform this procedure with a high success rate and a low complication rate.\r"

The mean birth weight, height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height indicators were found to decline significantly with increasing altitude, starting at an elevation greater than 1500 m (p less than 0.001, ANOVA). The reduction in growth was observed for all age groups and all birth weight groups studied. Part of the observed reduction in growth could be attributed to the lower birth weight of children born at higher altitude. However, the reduced growth status persisted after controlling for birth weight, suggesting the presence of an extrauterine growth retardation effect related to altitude.\r"

Hypercalciuria (urinary calcium greater than or equal to 0.15 mmol/kg/day) was observed in all but the control group. Covariate analysis demonstrated a significant effect of sodium, calcium, and vitamin D intakes (p less than 0.01) and sodium excretion (p less than 0.05) on urinary calcium excretion. Treatment with any of these diuretics in neonates may be associated with abnormal renal losses of calcium, sodium, chloride, and potassium. From a nutritional perspective, neonates requiring long-term diuretic therapy thereby require special consideration, including monitoring of mineral excretion and renal ultrasonography.\r"

Thus, among infants with neonatal seizures the risk for cerebral palsy was 420 times greater if there had been a low 5-minute Apgar score and other neonatal signs. Low Apgar score-abnormal signs-seizures constituted a cluster of events that served to identify, within the first days of life, a tiny subgroup of term newborn infants in whom risk for chronic motor disability was 55%, and for death or disability was 70%.\r"

The dose during the first day was 0.5 mg/kg, followed by a daily dose of 1 mg/kg for the rest of the treatment period in most patients. The drug was infused over 4 to 6 hours. During the first day, serum concentrations were above the target therapeutic level of 0.3 microgram/ml in all patients at 2 and 6 hours from the start of the infusion, in 12 of 13 patients at 12 hours, but in only 6 of 13 patients at 24 hours. On the third day, all concentrations were greater than 0.3 microgram/ml throughout the 24-hour period, and in 12 of 13 patients were greater than 0.5 microgram/ml. The same kinetic profile prevailed on days 7 to 10 of therapy, with a tendency for increasing concentrations. Elimination half-life was 9.93 +/- 1.5 hours (mean +/- SEM), clearance rate 26 +/- 5 ml/kg.hr, and distribution volume 378 +/- 25 ml/kg. The half-life inversely correlated with patient's age. Pharmacokinetic values calculated during the first day were not different from those calculated on day 3. Significant decreases in hemoglobin, platelets, and serum potassium concentration were recorded along with significant increases in serum creatinine, urea, and aspartate transaminase values. Because of the large pharmacokinetic variability and the high rate of serious adverse effects, individualized dosing of amphotericin B based on therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered.\r"

Thirty percent of the children with recurrent otitis media had a mild or moderate hearing loss. However, after multiple speech and language tests, we could not identify a delay in language acquisition in the otitis-prone children. At 3 to 4 years old, 36 children, including nine with a hearing loss at 2 years of age, were retested; all nine had normal hearing. Recurrent otitis media induced a temporary decrease in hearing sensitivity demonstrable at 2 years of age, which appeared to resolve as the children matured and which was not associated with delay in language acquisition.\r"

Recent studies have confirmed the clinical impression that a relationship exists between functional somatic complaints and negative life events in adolescents. Our goal was to investigate additional psychosocial characteristics that may be associated with functional complaints. One hundred fifteen adolescents coming for the first time to an adolescent medicine clinic completed standard measures of negative life events, psychophysiologic symptoms, self-esteem, peer social comparison, and family functioning before an independent evaluation by a physician. Patients with functional somatic complaints (chest pain, recurrent abdominal pain, limb pain, and hyperventilation syndrome) reported significantly more negative life events, lower self-esteem, more psychophysiologic symptoms and a lower self-evaluation than did patients coming for physical examination or routine health maintenance. Functional somatic complaints in adolescents may be associated with poor psychosocial adjustment and reaction to negative life events. In addition to ruling out organic disease, physicians dealing with these patients should evaluate other areas, including stressful life events, peer relations, and self-esteem.\r"

A relationship between residual clearance and growth velocity was inferred. However, the growth of children with a less severe reduction in function was affected intermittently by intercurrent infections and inadequately treated acidosis and salt wasting. Children with a more severe reduction in function, despite maintenance on the low-phosphorus formula, had elevated serum parathormone levels. We conclude that following growth (as serial growth velocity standard deviation scores) in relation to other variables gives more insight into factors affecting growth in these children; the level of residual function affects growth potential but other complicating factors also have an effect.\r"

Tumor types included medulloblastoma (19), brain-stem glioma (16), astrocytoma (13), and a miscellaneous glioma (12). Responses and sustained survivals were achieved. Responses were highly dependent on tumor type. Disease progression was halted in 73% of the children with medulloblastoma, and three have survived in complete remission for more than 10 years from the start of therapy with vincristine, nitrogen mustard, procarbazine, and prednisone. Two of four patients with anaplastic glioma, are long-term survivors. In contrast, less than one third of children with brain-stem gliomas responded. Toxicity consisted mainly of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infections, and rarely a procarbazine rash.\r"

One hundred seventy-seven ERGs were performed in 59 preterm and 52 term infants. An ERG was recorded as soon as 7 hours after birth and as early as 30 weeks after conception. In preterm infants the a-wave latency was longer and the amplitude less than in term infants of the same age. The amplitude of the ERG in preterm infants increased with the duration of light exposure. Longitudinal data on 15 preterm infants showed a reduction in a-wave latency. None of the ERG findings correlated with postconceptional age, which suggests that the duration of light exposure is a major determinant of the ERG pattern in preterm infants. Despite low circulating levels of retinol, no correlations with any of the ERG values were found.\r"

Systemic toxicity, including fever, chills, fatigue, and hypotension, increased with the dose of rH-TNF administered. Doses greater than 454 micrograms/m2 frequently caused severe lethargy and fatigue, which precluded hospital discharge of the patient at the completion of therapy. The dose-limiting toxicity was hypotension, and five patients treated at the two highest dose levels required dopamine treatment. Other organ-specific toxicity was modest and spontaneously resolved after 48 hours. The 24-hour infusions of rH-TNF were associated with significant decreases in serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein levels. Pharmacokinetic studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated peak plasma rH-TNF levels of 90-900 pg/mL. Despite continuous infusion of rH-TNF, no steady-state level was achieved. The recommended phase II dose for rH-TNF as a 24-hour continuous infusion is 545 micrograms/m2.\r"

The dysplastic lesion may be preneoplastic since long-term administration of these steroids to Nb rats is known to induce a high incidence of adenocarcinoma in the DLP. Treatment of rats with nonaromatizable 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 16 weeks caused enlargement but not dysplasia, implicating estrogen as a key factor in the genesis of the proliferative lesion. Compared with controls, the testosterone plus E2 treatment caused a 2.5-fold increase in nuclear type II estrogen binding sites which were confined to the DLP. Neither treatment significantly altered androgen content or levels of androgen receptor in the ventral prostate or DLP. Organ cultures of enlarged DLP containing foci of dysplasia metabolized more [3H]DHT than control tissue, which resulted in increased formation of the 5 alpha-androstane-3 beta, 17 beta-diol (3 beta-androstanediol) metabolite by these explants. Because 3 beta-androstanediol has previously been shown to displace [3H]E2 from cytosolic type I estrogen binding sites, the dysplasia may be caused by hyperstimulation of the DLP by the hormones and their normal metabolites produced in abnormal amounts.\r"

With the exception of treatment-induced nausea and vomiting, nonhematologic toxic effects were mild and no (or very little) local toxicity occurred. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the areas under the peritoneal concentration versus time curve averaged 16-fold and 17-fold more than the area under the plasma curve for cisplatin and melphalan, respectively.

The extent of disease at diagnosis among breast cancers detected by screening and the effect of screening on breast cancer mortality have been evaluated in the cohort of all HIP women diagnosed with breast cancer within 6 years of entry into the trial and followed at least 18 years after trial entry. Six years was the earliest time at which the number of cases diagnosed in the control group was equal to the number of cases diagnosed in the study group. In the cohorts of women 40-49 and 50-64 years of age at entry, shifts were significant to lower stages for screen-detected cases. As a result, the study group women in each age cohort had significantly lower breast cancer mortality than control group women when statistical analyses were restricted to data from cases only. In the 40-49 age-at-entry cohort, the reduced breast cancer mortality in the study group appears to result from lower mortality in stage I cases as well as from earlier case detection, and this may explain differences between the two age-at-entry cohorts in the length of follow-up time required to demonstrate a mortality reduction due to screening.\r"

The radiation dose to the thyroid gland was, on the average, approximately 0.5 Gy. The mean age at the time of examination was 44 years; 5% were under age 20. Patients were followed for an average of 20 years. Record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register identified 50 thyroid cancers occurring 5 years or more after the initial 131I examination, in contrast to 39.4 expected based on general population rates [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.27, 95% confidence interval = 0.94-1.67]. Risk was highest among males (SIR = 2.70, n = 10), patients followed 5-9 years (SIR = 2.22, n = 23), and patients receiving more than 74 microCi or 2.74 MBq of 131I (SIR = 2.04, n = 17). However, these observations were confounded by the fact that patients examined for a suspected thyroid tumor received the highest 131I exposures and were at highest overall risk (SIR = 2.77, n = 34). Patients given 131I for reasons other than a suspected tumor were not at increased risk (SIR = 0.62, n = 16). Patients anticipated to be at highest risk, i.e., women (SIR = 1.12, n = 40) and those observed for 10 years or more (SIR = 0.93, n = 27), showed no evidence of a dose response. Overall, these data provide little proof that 131I is carcinogenic in humans and support the notion that the carcinogenic potential of internal 131I beta particles might be as low as four times less than external x rays or gamma rays.\r"

In the absence of added androgen, there was a rapid increase in spontaneous cell growth, the increase being delayed by 2, 4, and 6 months when the cells were incubated with 0.01, 0.3, and 100 nM DHT, respectively. Conversely, the mitogenic effect of DHT decreased rapidly when originally androgen-sensitive cells were incubated with less than maximal concentrations of DHT. The most significant finding was the marked heterogeneity in the androgen sensitivity of the clones obtained after incubation for 2 months in the presence of less than maximal concentrations of DHT. In cells exposed to a maximal concentration of DHT (100 nM), only 2 of 22 clones were more sensitive to DHT (lower Km value) than the original clone, while 8 subclones were hyposensitive to DHT. On the other hand, when the cells were incubated for 2 months with a low (0.3 nM) concentration of DHT, 29% (7 of 24) of the clones were hypersensitive to DHT. Clones derived from cells treated with 0 or 0.1 nM DHT lost most of their responsiveness to DHT during the same time interval, with a simultaneous increase in spontaneous growth rate. The present data show that incubation of a clone of androgen-sensitive Shionogi carcinoma cells in the presence of a low DHT concentration, comparable to the circulating levels of DHT in castrated men, induces the development of androgen-hypersensitive cell clones that are able to grow on minute amounts of androgens. Such androgen-hypersensitive cells are likely to be unresponsive or resistant to antihormonal therapy. The present data emphasize the major importance of the hormonal environment on the maintenance, loss, and increase of tumor cell responsiveness to androgens.\r"

The total dose of HM was 168 +/- 197 and 181 +/- 234 mg on PCI and CSCI, respectively (P = NS). No significant difference was found in nausea, drowsiness, or number of hours of sleep. The total number of extra doses of HM was 6 +/- 7 on CSCI versus 2 +/- 3 on PCI (P = .007). At the end of the study, patients chose PCI and CSCI in seven and 10 cases, respectively (P = NS; 5 patients expressed no preference). We conclude that both methods were similar in regard to effectiveness and toxic effects in short-term hospital use.\r"

  ".W": "By using monoclonal antibodies to different Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) polypeptides in combination with immunoblotting, we detected antigens associated with EBV replication in extracts from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsy specimens. Major polypeptides associated with both the diffuse and the restricted components of the early antigen (EA) complex were found in extracts from nine of nine NPC biopsy specimens. Cells from an additional NPC biopsy specimen, passaged repeatedly in nude mice, were found to be positive for the major EA (restricted) polypeptide. This approach revealed that extracts from three of 14 biopsy specimens form other benign and malignant diseases also expressed these viral polypeptides. Therefore, for the first time, these results conclusively demonstrate the presence of EA polypeptides in extracts from NPC biopsy specimens. This finding provides at least a partial explanation for the reported prognostic value of antibodies to this antigen in patients with this disease.\r"

A review of 606 of these patients with blunt trauma was performed for the period from 1983 through 1986. When the group was evaluated there were 451 patients in the ISS cohort of 20-29 and 155 in the 30-39 group. The mean age was 30.5 years and 76% were males. A total of 259 patients were transported by ambulance and 347 by helicopter. Characteristics of the two groups were similar. The mean TS was 12.7 for ambulance and 12.1 for helicopter patients. Mean GCS was 10.4 in the ambulance group and 9.6 for helicopter patients. Overall the mortality for ambulance transported patients was 13% compared to 18% for the helicopter group. We conclude that there is no survival advantage in the helicopter transported group in an urban area with a sophisticated prehospital care system. Patients of rural origin deserve further study.\r"

The left hemidiaphragm was involved in 15 of 16 patients, and the delay in diagnosis from the time of arrival in the emergency center immediately after injury ranged from 16 hours to 14 years. In the patients in the Acute Group (delay of hours to days), three patients had diaphragmatic defects missed at the time of laparotomy, three patients had chest X-rays not immediately suggestive of diaphragmatic defects, two patients had false-negative lavages, and one patient treated elsewhere did not have a chest X-ray in the emergency room. In the patients in the Chronic Group (hernias presenting months to years after injury), four of seven patients had misreading of a recent chest X-ray or failure to have a chest X-ray performed during numerous return visits to the emergency center. Despite a variety of diagnostic maneuvers, these defects and hernias continue to be diagnosed after a delay. Careful review of early and late followup chest X-rays appears to be the easiest mechanism to avoid significant delays in diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "The simultaneous admission of nine youths to our institution following their ingestion of concentrated sodium hydroxide (which had been mistaken for wine) provided us with a unique opportunity to manage corrosive esophageal injuries ranging in severity from second-degree oral mucosal injury alone to full-thickness hypopharyngeal, esophageal, and gastric injury. The severity of injury was graded first on the basis of symptoms and physical examination of the mouth, and then in the operating room by rigid esophagoscopy. This procedure provided a logical approach to management. Three patients with second-degree oral burns required no surgery. Six patients required laparotomy with gastrostomy and/or chimney feeding jejunostomy, one required immediate esophagogastrectomy, and three required immediate total or subtotal gastrectomy. There were no deaths. Three patients have subsequently required esophageal replacement and three others have required repeated dilatations. At 2-year followup, all nine maintain their nutritional status orally, and all except for the previously mute patient can phonate. Ingestion of liquid lye requires a much more aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach than is currently recommended for ingestion of caustics in general. On the basis of our experience with these nine patients, we suggest the following for esophageal liquid lye injury: 1) early evaluation of the esophagus by esophagoscopy; 2) with esophageal burns, urgent laparotomy to assess gastric damage and gastrostomy to pass a string for subsequent retrograde dilatations; 3) adequate resection of stomach for gastric burns; 4) with deep esophageal burns, early esophagectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of thoracolumbar spine burst fracture with a neurologically intact patient is controversial, with advocates of operative and nonoperative approaches. Of 404 patients in a prospective spinal trauma study, 21 had burst fractures, were neurologically intact, and had greater than 1-year followup. This group was analyzed to evaluate treatment with early mobilization using a thoracolumbar total contact orthosis. The average time in a brace was 6 months. Two patients had pulmonary embolus treated successfully with anticoagulants. No patient required subsequent surgery for increasing kyphosis or neurologic deficit. Change in K angle at followup was 4.6 degrees (+/- 5.7) and change in anterior vertebral height was 6.1 degrees (+/- 10). All patients had a satisfactory pain score and most individuals returned to full employment. It is concluded that it is not necessary to routinely treat patients operatively with burst fractures if they fulfill the following criteria: 1) neurologically intact; 2) kyphosis angle less than 35 degrees; 3) other injuries do not preclude the use of a total contact orthosis; and 4) the patient is capable of understanding and cooperating with the treatment regime. These criteria are irrespective of the CT findings of posterior vertebral retropulsion and spinal canal narrowing.\r"

In order to determine the effect of verapamil on CNS blood flow during PDTAC, we calculated cerebral cortical (CC), proximal spinal cord (PSC), and distal spinal cord (DSC) blood flow using the microsphere method in Grade I beagles. Flow calculations were obtained at baseline (pre-PDTAC), following mobilization of the proximal descending aorta for 5-8 cm by ligating 3-5 pairs of intercostal arteries (ICA), during PDTAC (45 min), and during maximal reperfusion. Two groups were studied: 1) control (Cont) untreated (n = 5); 2) verapamil (Ver) treated (0.4 mg/kg IV just before PDTAC and just before reperfusion) (n = 5). Conclusions: I) Proximal ICA ligation produces no compromise to SC blood flow. II) Verapamil may protect the CNS by: 1) maintaining cerebral autoregulation during reperfusion; and 2) dampening hyperperfusion of the distal SC during reperfusion.\r"

Severely injured patients were those with at least one injury with an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) of greater than or equal to 4. Those with one fatal injury (AIS greater than or equal to 6), a critical head injury (AIS greater than or equal to 5) apart from acute epidural hematoma, or massive multiple injuries (Injury Severity Score greater than 59) were considered nonsalvageable; the remainder were considered salvageable. In the first year, six of 74 salvageable patients died, in the second year five of 76, and in the third year one of 69. The PDR rates were 0.32 (6/19), 0.23 (5/22), and 0.06 (1/17), respectively. There was no significant difference in the E of our trauma program over the 3 years. The apparent improvement in PDR in the second and third years resulted from an increased number of deaths among nonsalvageable patients and fewer deaths among salvageable patients. This finding demonstrates that PDR is sensitive to case mix and not just quality of care, and confirms the superiority of E over PDR for assessing a trauma program.\r"

There were 237 males and 73 females. Most patients were less than 30 years of age (73%). Drivers represented 57% of the injured. Falling off the machine and collisions were responsible for 60% of the injuries; 3.0% were due to mechanical failure of the snowmobile. The lower limbs and head and neck regions were most commonly affected (42.6 and 27.6%, respectively); less than 10% of the patients were wearing helmets at the time of the accident. We conclude that the human factor was responsible for the majority of the injuries. We recommend enforcement of legislation, intensification of public education about the hazards of driving snowmobiles, and modifications in the design of the engine, especially to provide increased protection for the lower limbs.\r"

Of a total of 872 laparotomies (1980-1986), 29 patients (0.7% of stab wounds and 6% of gunshot wounds) developed abscesses. Pancreatic and duodenal injuries, in the presence of concomitant colon perforation, were most frequently associated with abscess formation. Fourteen of the 29 patients had multiorgan failure (MOF), Group I, and 15 patients did not have MOF, Group II. Group I had a significantly higher Abdominal Trauma Index (ATI) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II), received greater number of perioperative transfusions and underwent a higher number of reoperations for sepsis than Group II patients. Radiologic imaging techniques were frequently inconclusive for the diagnosis and localization of intra-abdominal abscess in Group I. They were highly accurate in Group II. Fifty per cent of Group I patients died from sepsis and MOF. We conclude that the anatomic (ATI) and the physiologic (APACHE) scores are useful predictors of the potential for uncontrolled sepsis. In the presence of ongoing multiorgan failure, reoperation for sepsis is warranted on clinical grounds alone.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of all American Veterinary Medical Association members in Minnesota and Wisconsin was conducted by questionnaire to document injuries resulting from animal treatment. Of 995 respondents, 64.6% had sustained a major animal-related injury. Seventeen per cent were hospitalized within the last year. Of those hospitalized, 25.3% required a surgical procedure. Hand injuries were most common in a veterinarian's career (52.6% of respondents), followed by trauma to the arms (27.6%), and the head (20.8%). The thorax (8.3%), genitalia (3.9%), and intra-abdominal viscera (2.8%) were injured less often. Operative procedures were frequently required to treat veterinarian injury from animal patients. Thirty-five per cent of veterinarians required treatment for suture of lacerations, 10% for reduction of fracture/dislocation, and 5% for dental work in their career. One craniotomy and one carotid artery repair were necessary. Mechanism of injury was animal kick (35.5%), bite (34%), crush (11.7%), scratch (3.8%), and other interesting causes (14.9%). These included the patient pushing, goring, head butting, running over, and falling on the veterinarian. Additional work-related hazards included zoonotic disease, autoinoculation of live brucella vaccine, and self-inflicted scalpel injuries from sudden patient movement. The most common animals involved were bovine (46.5%), canine (24.2%), and equine (15.2%). Lost days from work secondary to animal injury averaged 1.3 days (range, 0-180 days) in 1986 and 8.5 days (range, 0-365 days) during the veterinarian's career. Job related automobile accidents also occurred. Veterinarians averaged more than 300 miles driven per week, and only 56% reported following the speed limit. Fifteen per cent did not wear seat belts. Self-treatment of injuries was common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They must be fresh, noninfected, and free of eschar and debris with a moist, sensate surface that demonstrates capillary blanching and refill. Wounds must be inspected regularly for nonadherence and signs of infection. Early fluid accumulation requires prompt aspiration. Biobrane should be removed if fluid reaccumulates or the Biobrane becomes nonadherent at any time after 48 hours. When used appropriately, Biobrane offers significant advantages over conventional therapy of acute partial-thickness burns.\r"

Osmotic fragility, and supernatant hemoglobin and potassium levels of the warmed RBC's were not significantly different from baseline values. Aliquots of the warmed RBC's were labeled with 51Chromium and transfused into autologous donors. Mean radiolabeled RBC survival at 24 hours was 90.2% (S.D. 6.2%), and mean radiolabeled RBC survival time was 25.3 days (S.D. 2.7 days). These results are within the normal range for RBC's stored for 14 days. This study suggests that RBC survival after transfusion is not impaired by admixture blood warming using saline at 70 degrees C.\r"

Sixty-three such patients were identified and further descriptive analyses performed. The majority of spinal fractures occurred not in the cervical spine, but in the thoracic and lumbosacral spine areas. Since a number of these spinal fractures have associated neurologic complications, only by prompt evaluation of the entire spinal column can further injuries be prevented. Based on our data, we feel that patients with multiple injuries and an altered sensorium should have the entire spine protected and evaluated radiologically before being cleared.\r"

There were 7 failures, 4 in patients who in retrospect were not suitable candidates for the percutaneous operation (long stenotic segment and redundant renal pelvis) and 3 for which there was no obvious cause. All failures were apparent soon after removal of the stent that was inserted at the end of the procedure.\r"

The percutaneous procedure required less time (average 89.4 minutes versus 106.4 minutes for an open operation) and entailed less postoperative pain (60 per cent of the patients required an average of 4.7 unit doses of narcotics, whereas 88 per cent of the pyeloplasty patients required an average of 10.3 unit doses). The average hospital stay was less after endopyelotomy (average 6.2 versus 10.0 days) and return to normal activity occurred more quickly (average 19.8 versus 41.5 days). Endopyelotomy was successful in 87.5 per cent of the patients, with all failures being apparent within 6 weeks and they were easily correctable by traditional methods. Reported success rates of pyeloplasty ranged from 95 to 98 per cent.\r"

Rehospitalization was necessary in 57 patients. Over-all, the rate free of stones after followup was 72.2 per cent and it was not different for primary and recurrent stone patients. Rates free of stones were influenced mainly by the primary stone location and the number of stones in a renal unit. Patients with lower caliceal stones had a rate without calculi of only 57.8 per cent. Almost identical results were obtained for stones other than in the lower calix, when fragments were found in the lower calix at the time the patient was discharged from the hospital. The pre-treatment stone volume, as determined by measuring the stone area in square millimeters, did not influence the final rates free of stones for calculi up to 400 mm.2, that is 2.4 cm. of a sphere. Only calculi larger than 400 mm.2 showed an inverse relationship to the final rate free of stones. Multiple stones yielded a success rate of 64 per cent, with 90 per cent of the patients having regrowth of residual fragments. Serious complications during followup were not encountered.\r"

Of the patients 11 underwent emergency dialysis for hyperkalemia, fluid overload or metabolic acidosis. Mean serum creatinine at presentation was 6.5 mg. per cent. Preliminary decompression of the obstructed kidney was done in 14 patients (20 renal units) with a serum creatinine of more than 3 mg. per cent at presentation. Reconstruction was done in all patients (31 of 36 renal units) after decompression and control of infection. Pyeloplasty was done in 24 renal units, vesicopyelostomy in 3 pelvic kidneys and calicoureteroplasty in 2 renal units with an intrarenal pelvis. Two renal units were removed. All patients showed improvement in renal function and the mean postoperative serum creatinine value was 2.05 mg. per cent. The postoperative serum creatinine value showed a significant positive correlation with the initial value as well as with the initial blood urea levels. However, the postoperative serum creatinine value showed no correlation with patient age, duration of symptoms, serum creatinine level after preliminary nephrostomy and presence or absence of urinary infection. Postoperative recovery (on the basis of postoperative serum creatinine levels) in patients who had bilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction was not different from those with a solitary functioning kidney and ureteropelvic junction obstruction.\r"

These so-called incidentally detected renal cell carcinomas are increasing in incidence, generally of low stage and associated with significantly improved survival, and they constitute the majority of the patients with improved prognosis during the recent 2 decades. The clinical course and disease stage in patients who continue to present with symptoms of the disease have not changed in the last 40 years. These data suggest that with currently available treatments for renal cell carcinoma a principal method to improve the prognosis of this disease would be through earlier detection. Low disease incidence would mitigate against morphological screening but case finding techniques may prove useful.\r"

Concomitant urothelial atypia can be demonstrated by pre-selected site mucosal biopsies. However, a number of patients have new tumors despite normal pre-selected site biopsies. To investigate whether urinary cytology is a better indicator for concomitant urothelial atypia than pre-selected site biopsies, we studied in bladder tumor patients the correlation between the findings of pre-selected site biopsies (8 per patient) at tumor resection and urinary cytology (2 per patient) after successful resection. Concomitant urothelial atypia was demonstrated by biopsies in 52 per cent of the patients, of whom 60 per cent had grade II atypia and 40 per cent had carcinoma in situ. All patients with concomitant carcinoma in situ in biopsies had positive cytology findings. Of the patients with concomitant grade II atypia in biopsies 15 per cent had negative cytology studies. In 48 per cent of the patients no urothelial atypia in pre-selected site biopsies was demonstrable. However, cytology was positive, that is neoplastic cells were present, in 64 per cent of these specimens (19 patients). Of the 19 patients 16 currently have had demonstrable urothelial atypia in pre-selected site mucosal biopsies at a later occasion. We conclude that urinary cytology seems to be a better indicator for the presence of concomitant urothelial atypia than pre-selected site mucosal biopsies and, therefore, it can be used as a screening procedure for patients without demonstrable concomitant carcinoma in situ at tumor resection.\r"

The prompt recognition and appropriate management of these injuries may significantly impact subsequent morbidity, yet few studies have addressed the identification of the risk factors for urethral injury in men with pelvic fractures. We reviewed retrospectively the records of 405 men with pelvic fractures seen at our medical center, including 21 (5 per cent) with urethral injuries. Of the 21 men 14 (67 per cent) had fractures involving a pubic ramus and a sacroiliac joint, and 12 (57 per cent) had no physical signs (blood at the urethral meatus, perineal hematoma or a high-riding prostate) that would suggest a urethral injury. The likelihood for the presence of physical signs is directly related to the interval since injury. We believe that men with the combination of rami fractures and sacroiliac disruption should undergo retrograde urethrograms before urethral instrumentation, and that physical signs are unreliable indications for urethral injuries, especially soon after the injury.\r"

This finding suggests that total obliteration of the posterior urethra can be managed effectively by endoscopic techniques. Comparison of endoscopic treatment with transpubic urethroplasty revealed a decrease in operative time, blood loss and hospital stay with endoscopic management. We recommend that transpubic urethroplasty be reserved for patients in whom urethral continuity cannot be re-established with relatively safe and simple endourological techniques.\r"

The procedure is done through the vestibule of the vagina with clear exposure of the vesical neck and urethra anteriorly, and easier accessibility for dissection of the vagina from the posterior wall of the vesical neck and upper urethra. This approach reduces the incidence of occlusive cuff erosion and eliminates the chance of shifting of the device. The model AS 800 artificial sphincter was implanted for the first time in 4 patients with total urinary incontinence. Primary deactivation was used and the patients practiced nocturnal deactivation. Complete post-activation continence was achieved in all 4 patients. Mean followup has been 14 months. This approach is easier and less traumatic to the patient. Hospitalization and postoperative recovery times are markedly reduced. Technically, the method is much simpler to perform, particularly dissection between the vagina and the posterior aspect of the urethra, thereby reducing the operative time and complication rate.\r"

In this study 37 impotent patients underwent a diagnostic nocturnal penile tumescence evaluation (including measurements of rigidity, pulsations and bulboischiocavernosus muscle activity) and the results were correlated with subsequent response to intracorporeal pharmacological testing. Most but not all patients with psychogenic impotence and all with neurogenic impotence responded with good erections. For vasculogenic impotence response rate depended upon impairment severity determined from nocturnal penile tumescence measurements; none of the severe cases versus 90 per cent of the milder cases responded. The results indicate that response to intracorporeal pharmacological testing does not accurately distinguish psychogenic from organic impotence, is best for neurogenic impotence and worst for severe vasculogenic impotence, and can be predicted accurately by nocturnal penile tumescence measurements.\r"

All patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and 9 had pathological stage C disease (6 with capsular penetration only and 3 with seminal vesicle invasion). A total of 12 patients had pathological stage D1 disease by virtue of positive nodes on permanent sections after frozen sections were read as negative. Among the patients with pathological stage C disease 67 per cent were free of recurrence 6 years after radical prostatectomy. Of the patients with seminal vesicle invasion 33 per cent had recurrence compared to 17 per cent of those with capsular penetration only. Among the 12 stage D1 cancer patients 75 per cent were free of recurrence at 6 years. In both groups patients who were followed beyond 7 years had a diminished survival free of tumor owing to late tumor recurrences. The results indicate that the intermediate survival rates free of tumor in patients with clinically understaged A or B prostatic cancer are remarkably good without adjuvant therapy. However, survival without recurrence appears to decrease after 7 years. All patients who failed treatment did so distantly; no patient failed with local recurrence alone. These results may be important in the evaluation of adjuvant therapy protocols currently under investigation for patients with clinically understaged prostate cancer.\r"

Although the followup is too short for analysis of tumor recurrence or patient survival rates, the results indicate that salvage radical prostatectomy, although technically demanding, is feasible and that in the majority of properly selected patients the tumor can be removed completely.\r"

Selective membranous urethral surgery can be performed with ease, preserving external sphincter integrity. This maneuver represents an advance over any other technique by almost eliminating the risk of stenosis, urinary fistula and incontinence owing to failure of precise reapproximation of the membranous urethra.\r"

In 16 patients who underwent this procedure immediately after bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy the traditional low morbidity of radical perineal prostatectomy was retained, and potency was preserved in 5 of 9 patients (56 per cent), including all whose tumor was confined within the specimen margins. Review of the anatomy of the pelvic fascia also demonstrates that additional fascia around the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the prostate can be removed during radical perineal prostatectomy when one is willing to sacrifice the cavernous nerves to achieve a more radical excision of the prostate.\r"

During acupuncture at the Sp. 6 point there were periodic increases in intraurethral pressure at the distal urethra, which were measured with a microtip transducer. Acupuncture-induced detrusor inhibition and external sphincteric contractions were demonstrated. Clinically symptomatic improvement was noted in 22 of the 26 patients who were treated by acupuncture at the Sp. 6 point. Our studies indicated that acupuncture could be used as a simple and effective method to treat female patients with frequency, urgency and dysuria.\r"

Household respondents identified initially from a random probability sample were invited to undergo a free clinic evaluation followed by an invitation to free urodynamic testing. Of the 1,955 household respondents 456 women and 298 men attended the clinic. From this group 169 women and 94 men accepted the urodynamic invitation. Cystometric studies reveal a significant difference between the over-all prevalence of uninhibited detrusor contraction between genders, 7.9 per cent for women and 35 per cent for men. The occurrence of uninhibited detrusor contractions is more prevalent among incontinent than continent subjects and this difference is marginally significant. There is no significant association between uninhibited detrusor contractions and symptoms of difficult bladder emptying, irritative symptoms, voiding frequency, nocturia and urodynamic diagnosis of outlet obstruction (normal or high pressure and poor flow) but there were significant associations with responses to questions about the delay in getting to a toilet. The mean bladder capacities of men and women do not differ significantly between the different age groups but the capacity is significantly smaller for those with uninhibited detrusor contractions. The post-void residual urine volume shows no association with the continence status. These findings raise questions regarding our conventional thinking as to the etiology of uninhibited detrusor contractions, especially in men, and of urinary incontinence in general.\r"

We summarize a 37-year clinical experience with a form of urinary diversion that provides sphincteric urinary continence, and unexcelled long-term preservation of renal function and upper urinary anatomy. From our review it appears that the infant with exstrophy is served best by neonatal closure of the exstrophic bladder with attempts to establish urinary continence later in childhood. When other methods to establish urinary continence are unsuccessful and satisfactory anal continence has been demonstrated, a diverting colostomy combined with anastomosis of the isolated bladder to the isolated rectal stump offers an acceptable long-term alternate form of urinary diversion to produce sphincteric urinary continence with relative freedom from upper urinary deterioration.\r"

Antisperm antibodies were assessed with an ELISA. Testicular alterations, which were observed in a minority of animals after vasovasostomy, consisted mainly of depletion of germ cells. Mean serum antisperm antibody levels were greater for animals with altered testes than for rats with normal testicular histology. In addition, the proportion of rats that showed a positive antisperm antibody response was greater among animals with testicular changes than among those with unaltered testes. When the present results on Sprague-Dawley rats were compared with previous findings on the highly responsive Lewis strain, it was evident that the incidence of testicular changes and the proportion of positive antibody responders were greater in the Lewis strain. However, elevated antisperm antibodies and testicular alterations appeared to be more tightly linked in the less responsive Sprague-Dawley rats.\r"

The study was conducted on 28 pigs, 15 castrated males, four uncastrated males and nine females, divided into four groups: control unoperated, and three operated groups. Group I contained young piglets (castrated males, uncastrated males and females), group II contained adult animals and group III contained sham operated animals. An AS 800 belt occlusion cuff was implanted in the deflated state distal to the bladder neck around the urethra in the young and adult groups, while no sphincter was implanted in the sham group. Neither primary nor secondary activation was done. The pigs were followed for a period of six to eight weeks and then sacrificed. The morphological and histological observations on the effects of the artificial sphincter cuff on the underlying urethral tissue showed significant transmural atrophy of the urethral and prostatic segment underlying the cuff in the young growing castrated and uncastrated male group with mild changes in the young female group. Bladder rupture occurred in three uncastrated males. There were no changes encountered in the adult or sham operated groups. Variable degrees of upper tract changes and renal deterioration were seen in the young group. These changes occurred mainly in the male piglets while a lesser degree occurred in the female piglets. No changes were demonstrated in the adult and sham groups. This study suggests the possibility of similar changes occurring in young male children who have undergone artificial sphincter implantation.\r"

Changes in these dynamic parameters were seen which indicate that these stents caused renal outflow obstruction. The severity of this obstruction appears dependent upon the size of the catheter and the temporal length of intubation. This study indicates that double J stents provide sub-optimal drainage of the renal pelvis and damaged ureter.\r"

In a previous study it was shown that outflow obstruction induced both hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the smooth muscle cells. This was determined by means of morphometry and analyses of DNA and RNA. The results of the present investigation confirm the findings of previous studies that these changes to a considerable extent are reversible after removal of the outflow obstruction. This seems to be true both in animals obstructed for a short period of time (10 days) and in animals where the hypertrophy and hyperplasia processes have diminished (six weeks).\r"

Investigation of two potential tumor-specific immunotherapeutic agents using a murine transitional-cell carcinoma model (MBT-2) is reported. The survival of mice immunized with tumor proteins obtained by treating tumor cells with either 1-butanol or ethylchlorformate was compared to the survival of animals immunized with BCG. Long-term immunity conferred by each of these agents was also assessed. Significant protection by both agents was noted in all treatment groups compared to controls. Long-term immunity was also found to result from treatment with both investigational agents as well as with BCG. Butanol-extracted antigens and ethylchlorformate polymerized tumor protein may be useful as immunotherapeutic alternatives to BCG.\r"

C3H/He mice were transplanted subcutaneously in the hind limb with 5 x 10(5) tumor cells. Ten to 14 days later when the tumor reached a diameter of five to seven mm., it was surgically removed. Mice were then randomized into four groups to receive a total of three treatments on days 1, 3 and 5 after surgery: 1) saline (control group); 2) CP, 250 micrograms. into the surgical site; 3) CDDP, 5 micrograms./gm. body weight intraperitoneally; and 4) combined CP and CDDP. Recurrence of tumor occurred in 70%, 52%, 55% and 28% of mice receiving surgery only, CP, CDDP, and combined CP and CDDP respectively. In the second part of the experiment, phagocytic activity using chemiluminescence assay and natural killer (NK) activity using chromium-51 release assay were determined with cells from the peritoneum, spleen and inguinal lymph nodes. CP or CDDP alone enhanced the phagocytic and NK activity. The most significant enhancement was obtained with cells from the inguinal lymph nodes of mice receiving combined CP and CDDP, the group with the lowest tumor recurrence. These results suggest that combination of CP and CDDP may be useful in control of postsurgical recurrence of bladder cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of terazosin for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Terazosin is a potent and selective alpha 1 adrenergic blocking agent structurally similar to prazosin. The alpha adrenergic binding properties of terazosin were studied in human prostate adenomas and canine brains using radioligand receptor binding methods. Saturation analyses were performed at varying concentrations of [125I]-Heat and [3H]rauwolscine [( 3H]Ra) in human prostate adenomas and canine brains. The binding of [125I]-Heat and [3H]Ra in the human prostates and canine brains was consistently saturable and of high affinity. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for [125I]-Heat binding in the canine brains and human prostate adenomas was 84.4 +/- 4.3 pM and 65.4 +/- 19.2 pM, respectively (p greater than 0.05). The (Kd) for [3H]Ra binding in the human prostate adenomas and canine brains was 1.21 +/- 0.23 nM and 1.52 +/- 0.28 nM, respectively (p greater than 0.05). The density of alpha 1 (0.37 +/- 0.15 fmol/mg. wet wt.) and alpha 2 (0.29 +/- 0.09 fmol/mg. wet wt. adrenergic binding sites in the human adenomas were similar (p greater than 0.05). The IC50 corrected (IC50 corr) of terazosin for [125I]-Heat and [3H]Ra binding sites in the human prostate was 2.5 nM and 1.0 micron., respectively. The IC50 corr of terazosin for [125I]-Heat and [3H]Ra binding sites in the canine brain was 2.0 nM and 0.8 microM, respectively. The competitive binding assays indicate that terazosin binds selectively to alpha 1 adrenergic binding sites in the human prostate and canine brain.\r"

To describe internists' current practices of prescribing nicotine gum and other drugs for smoking cessation, we surveyed randomly selected internists. Most internists prescribe nicotine gum to fewer than 25% of patients who try to quit smoking. Contrary to current recommendations, nearly half of internists would suggest gum to help patients cut down on smoking, and a majority would limit its use to less than three months. There is no evidence that sedatives are useful for smoking cessation, but one fourth of internists had recently prescribed them for that purpose. There is a widespread need for physician education about how to use nicotine gum more effectively.\r"

This intervention involved advice to stop smoking, the setting of a quit date, the offer of nicotine gum, and four follow-up visits. Smoking cessation was measured by self-report after one year and validated using saliva cotinine measures. Using a criterion of at least three months of abstinence, 8.8% of the patients of the trained physicians had stopped smoking at the one-year follow-up compared with 4.4% and 6.1% of the patients in the usual care and gum only groups, respectively.\r"

The results indicate that heavy smokers are more dependent on cigarettes. Compared with smokers consuming 15 or fewer cigarettes per day, heavy smokers reported greater difficulty quitting, were more troubled by withdrawal symptoms, experienced stronger urges and cravings, and had higher scores on a modified version of the Fagerstrom tolerance questionnaire. Heavy smokers weighed more and were more obese as measured by body mass index. Eighty percent of heavy smokers were classified correctly using discriminant function analysis with two dependence-related measures entering as the most important discriminator variables. Logistic regression analyses yielded similar results. The findings underscore the importance of addressing potential physical dependence factors when developing smoking-cessation treatments for heavy smokers.\r"

Long-term gum users were similar to treatment failures in cigarette consumption and tobacco dependence, while \"gum-free\" successes were significantly lighter and less-dependent smokers. Long-term gum users used more gum during the four weeks of treatment than treatment failures, who in turn used more than the gum-free successes.

Each resident kept a sleep diary, gave a self-assessment of motivation and fatigue, and underwent a battery of psychometric tests each morning for 18 or 19 days. The psychometric tests measured cognition, discernment, visual and auditory vigilance, and rapid eye-hand coordination. Sleep deprivation was defined as the lack of four hours of continuous sleep during the preceding 24 hours, and it occurred during 89% of the on-call nights. Daily testing in a repeated-measures design allowed each participant to serve as his or her own control. Sleep deprivation did not affect overall cognitive or motor performance. Further analysis of the correlation between sleep parameters (total sleep and longest uninterrupted sleep interval) and performance on each component of the psychometric test battery identified changes in performance on some tests but only trivial effects due to sleep. The assumption that sleep deprivation associated with usual on-call schedules impairs cognitive and motor performance of residents such that clinical care of patients may be compromised is not supported by our observations.\r"

  ".W": "All tenth graders in four senior high schools (N = 1447) from two school districts participated in a cardiovascular disease risk-reduction trial. Within each district, one school was assigned at random to receive a special 20-session risk-reduction intervention and one school served as a control. At a two-month follow-up, risk factor knowledge scores were significantly greater for students in the treatment group. Compared with controls, a higher proportion of those in the treatment group who were not exercising regularly at baseline reported regular exercise at follow-up. Almost twice as many baseline experimental smokers in the treatment group reported quitting at follow-up, while only 5.6% of baseline experimental smokers in the treatment group graduated to regular smoking compared with 10.3% in the control group. Students in the treatment group were more likely to report that they would choose \"heart-healthy\" snack items. Beneficial treatment effects were observed for resting heart rate, body mass index, triceps skin fold thickness, and subscapular skin fold thickness. The results suggest that it is feasible to provide cardiovascular disease risk-reduction training to a large segment of the population through school-based primary prevention approaches.\r"

Abdominal lymphangiogram had a false-negative rate of 0 but a false positive rate of 70%. Clinical stage III disease was significantly downstaged at laparotomy (65% of cases). Postoperative complication rate was 4% and there were no operative deaths. A subset of patients not requiring laparotomy have been identified. Because the quality of staging laparotomy and lymphangiography was variable, we encourage all centres treating patients with Hodgkin's disease to review their own experience with these techniques before making individual patient treatment decisions.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1978 to April 1983, 53 patients were treated with cisplatin-vinblastine-bleomycin chemotherapy because of advanced nonseminomatous testicular tumor (NSTT). After the chemotherapy, the serum tumor markers were back to normal in 41 patients, of whom 35 were eligible for surgical removal of the residual tumor. In four patients, vital tumor tissue was found in the residual tumor. Salvage chemotherapy resulted in complete remission. Residual mature teratoma was encountered after the chemotherapy in 15 of the 25 patients with a teratomatous component and in one of the ten patients without a teratomatous component in the primary tumor. On completion of the study, 38 of the 53 patients (72%) are still alive, with a median follow-up of 65 months. Subdivided by tumor volume, survival is found to amount to 92% for small-volume disease, 67% for large-volume disease, and 64% for very-large-volume disease. Six patients (11%) developed a recurrence in the course of the follow-up. Exploratory laparotomy after remission induction chemotherapy is necessary in all patients with a teratomatous component in the primary testicular tumor who have become tumor marker negative, irrespective of the roentgenographic findings of the retroperitoneum. Patients without a teratomatous component in the primary tumor should have exploratory laparotomy only in case of roentgenographic evidence of retroperitoneal residual tumor. A thoracotomy is needed only in the presence of roentgenographic evidence of pulmonary residual lesions.\r"

Twelve patients were found to have liver involvement with Hodgkin's disease; 2 had had wedge biopsies only and ten had had both wedge and needle biopsies. In all ten with both wedge and needle biopsies, the wedge biopsies were positive for liver involvement, but in only five were the needle biopsies positive.

All had preoperative catheterization. Ninety-six percent of the patients underwent balloon atrial septostomy and 90% received prostaglandin E1 infusion until the time of the operation. The anatomy of the coronary arteries according to the Yacoub classification was as follows: type A, 82 patients; type B, 5 patients; type C, 4 patients; type D, 23 patients; and type E, 6 patients. Continuous hypothermic bypass with no circulatory arrest was used for all patients except two. Myocardial protection was ensured by crystalloid cardioplegia. Coronary artery relocation was performed according to the Yacoub technique with some modifications, and pulmonary artery reconstruction was done according to the Lecompte maneuver in all patients, even when the great vessels had a side-by-side relationship. The proximal pulmonary artery was reconstructed with two circular patches for the first 10 patients and with a single large posterior patch for the last 110 patients. Tanned heterologous pericardium was used for the first 25 patients and autologous native pericardium for the last 95 patients. The perioperative mortality rates were 8.3% for the entire series and 5.4% for the last 110 patients, with no deaths in the group having transposition plus ventricular septal defect. Late death from acute myocardial infarction occurred in two patients in the second month after operation. No patient was lost to follow-up, which ranged from 2 to 46 months (mean 16 +/- 11.2, standard deviation). The follow-up included sequential noninvasive evaluations and 32 catheterizations performed 10 to 18 months postoperatively. Two patients were reoperated on for pulmonary stenosis caused by retraction of the two heterologous pericardial patches, but neither died. Six others have mild to moderate pulmonary stenosis. Two patients have trivial aortic regurgitation. None have aortic dilatation or supravalvular aortic stenosis. The 108 survivors have no cardiovascular symptoms. They all are in sinus rhythm, have normal left ventricular function, have no ischemic problems, and receive no medication.\r"

We evaluated the results in all 15 patients (median age 13 years) who had this procedure at the Mayo Clinic between 1973 and 1979. There were two (13%) operative deaths. One patient was lost to long-term follow-up. Of the 12 operative survivors for whom follow-up data were available, 11 reported subjective improvement in exercise tolerance and activity level. There were seven late deaths: six from cardiovascular problems and one from an accident. There are five survivors currently alive (average 10.8 years after operation). Patients who survived the operation for more than 5 years had a significantly (p less than 0.05) lower pulmonary resistance preoperatively than those who survived less than 5 years. The hemoglobin level decreased from 21.1 gm/dl before operation to 18.4 gm/dl, and arterial saturation was increased from 64% to 85% at an average of 9 years after operation. We conclude that this operation produces subjective improvement and lessens hypoxemia and polycythemia. In some patients, palliation may be achieved for 10 years or longer.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in blood flow through the inferior and superior venae cavae during cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta just above the diaphragm were studied in 28 miniature pigs anesthetized with enflurane titrated to maintain systemic arterial blood pressure close to normal values. Surgical preparation included sternotomy with subsequent placement of a noncannulating electromagnetic probe around the ascending aorta and a cannulating electromagnetic probe in the transected inferior vena cava. Superior vena caval flow was calculated as the difference between aortic flow and inferior vena caval flow. Clamping of the thoracic aorta alone (n = 10) was accompanied by severe arterial hypertension, a dramatic decrease in inferior vena caval flow, and an increase in superior vena caval flow, which resulted in a moderate increase in aortic flow. Simultaneous clamping of the thoracic aorta and inferior vena cava (n = 13) was accompanied by no significant change in arterial pressure or superior vena caval flow. The oxygen content in mixed venous blood significantly (p less than 0.05) increased from 9.5 +/- 1.1 to 13.4 +/- 1.8 ml.dl-1 in animals undergoing clamping of the thoracic aorta only, but did not change significantly in animals subjected to simultaneous clamping of the aorta and inferior vena cava. The study demonstrates a substantial increase in superior vena caval flow during cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta. Further studies elucidating the mechanism of the observed changes are required.\r"

  ".U": "88317659\r", 
  ".W": "The results of internal mammary artery grafting in 50 patients with a body surface area less than 1.6 m2 were compared with those in 54 patients with a larger body surface area. Age (58.8 +/- 8.2 versus 54.9 +/- 10.3 years old) and prevalence of female gender (28% versus 4%) were significantly different between the group of patients with a small body surface area and the group with a large body surface area, respectively. However, the prevalence of unstable angina, previous myocardial infarction, extent of coronary artery disease, and preoperative ejection fraction was not significantly different between the two groups. The mean number of distal anastomoses was 3.0 and 2.8, and the mean duration of aortic occlusion was 65.6 +/- 23.0 minutes and 59.5 +/- 21.7 minutes in the small and large body surface area groups, respectively (not significant). The mean free flow rate of the internal mammary artery was 65.6 +/- 16.8 ml/min in the small body surface area group and 78.0 +/- 21.6 ml/min in the large body surface area group (p less than 0.05). The diameters of the anterior descending and the circumflex arteries were significantly smaller in the small body surface area group. Two patients (4%) died within 30 days of operation and one patient died later in the small body surface area group, whereas no death was noted in the large body surface area group (not significant). No significant differences were found in the incidence of aortic balloon pumping, perioperative myocardial infarction, and serious postoperative complications between the two groups. Symptomatic relief was equally good in both groups (92% and 96%). The patency rate of the internal mammary artery was 95% (42/44) in the small body surface area group and 100% (48/48) in the large body surface area group within 1 year, mean 2.3 +/- 2.4 months. In conclusion, internal mammary artery grafting can be performed safely and effectively even in patients with small body structure. Though the blood flow of the internal mammary artery and the size of the coronary arteries were smaller in patients with small body structure, excellent patency of the internal mammary artery graft and satisfactory symptomatic relief can be expected.\r"

  ".W": "Low cardiac output in infants after cardiac operations continues to be a problem, yet little experimental work has been done to evaluate the various methods of protecting the immature myocardium. In this study, we have used an isolated working heart model to test three methods of myocardial protection in 3- to 4-week-old rabbit hearts: (1) topical cooling, (2) single-dose cardioplegia plus topical cooling, and (3) multiple-dose cardioplegia plus topical cooling. Myocardial temperature was maintained at 10 degrees C during ischemia, and St. Thomas' Hospital solution was used for cardioplegia. Sets of 18 hearts were subjected to 60, 90, or 120 minutes of ischemia, and within each set six hearts were protected by all three methods. After 90 and 120 minutes of ischemia, the percent recovery of aortic flow (expressed as mean +/- standard error of the mean) was lower in hearts protected with multiple-dose cardioplegia plus topical cooling (61.5% +/- 4.8%, 50.7% +/- 14.2%) than in those protected with topical cooling (92.4% +/- 5.7%, 94.3% +/- 12.8%) or single-dose cardioplegia plus topical cooling (86.4% +/- 5.3%, 90.2 +/- 3.6%). However, adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, and glycogen levels were adequately preserved in all groups. Both topical cooling and single-dose cardioplegia provide effective protection for the immature rabbit heart during ischemia, but multiple-dose cardioplegia plus topical cooling results in inadequate preservation of hemodynamic function, despite adequate preservation of myocardial high-energy phosphate stores.\r"

The biventricular endocardial surface area/ventricular mass ratios were calculated in 10 neonatal (2.5 +/- 0.2:1) and 10 adult (0.6 +/- 0.1:1) pigs (p less than 0.001). Three groups of neonatal pigs underwent 1 hour of global myocardial ischemia while being supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. Myocardial protection was by deep systemic hypothermia (group 1), moderate systemic hypothermia and cardioplegia (group 2), or by deep systemic hypothermia and cardioplegia (group 3). Left ventricular end-systolic pressure-dimension and end-diastolic pressure-dimension relationships were measured before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Septal temperatures remained below 20 degrees C in groups 1 and 3 but rose above 20 degrees C in group 2. Groups 1 and 2 had moderate and mild ventricular stiffening, respectively, whereas group 3 showed no diastolic dysfunction. Ventricular contractility was increased (p less than 0.05) in group 3. Techniques for myocardial preservation used during operations for congenital heart disease must consider the large endocardial surface area/mass ratio and the rewarming effects of systemic blood. The combination of deep systemic hypothermia and cardioplegia provided superior myocardial protection compared with the other techniques tested.\r"

  ".W": "The fate of the residual peak systolic left ventricular-aortic gradient was studied perioperatively in 14 patients with membranous discrete subaortic stenosis. In nine (group A) the initial postrepair left ventricular-aortic gradient was greater than 35 mm Hg (mean 56.8 +/- 13.4), and in five (group B) there was no significant postoperative gradient (mean 15.3 +/- 3.2 mm Hg). The operation included membranectomy and myectomy. Peak left ventricular-aortic pressure gradient, endogenous levels of norepinephrine, peak rate of rise of left ventricular pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, and central venous pressure were recorded at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass and in 3-hour intervals for the next 9 hours. In group A during that period there was a 67% reduction in peak systolic left ventricular-aortic gradient (from 56.8 +/- 13.4 to 18 +/- 14 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Concomitant reduction in the initial endogenous norepinephrine level was observed (from 982.1 +/- 181 to 422.6 +/- 109 pg/ml, p less than 0.001). A consistent linear relationship between norepinephrine levels and peak systolic left ventricular-aortic gradient was found (r = 0.78). Systolic left ventricular pressure decreased from 174.2 +/- 24.8 to 113.8 +/- 14.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Marked reduction in peak rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (from 3455 +/- 636 to 2161 +/- 680 mm Hg/sec, p less than 0.001) was observed. Cardiac index increased and systemic vascular resistance decreased during the study period (from 2.11 +/- 0.2 to 3.07 +/- 0.26 L/min, p less than 0.001, and from 2172 +/- 331 to 1233 +/- 202 dynes/sec/cm-5, p less than 0.001, respectively). There were no significant changes in heart rate (p = not significant) and central venous pressure p = not significant). Conclusion: Some of the residual perioperative left ventricular-aortic gradients in patients with discrete subaortic stenosis undergoing repairs are dynamic and transient, and are probably related to increased postoperative sympathetic activity.\r"

  ".W": "Pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum usually exist as isolated abnormalities. Only 19 cases of associated congenital heart defects have been reported. Significant complications related to uncorrected pectus excavatum have been described either during or after cardiac operations. Therefore we reviewed our experience with these coexisting lesions to assess the risk of surgical repair of chest wall deformities before and after correction of congenital cardiac anomalies. Among 20,860 infants and children with congenital heart disease seen at our institution, 36 (0.17%) had associated anterior thoracic deformities, 22 of whom underwent surgical correction of pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum. Ten of these 22 patients had pectus repair after a cardiac operation. Pleural or pericardial entry was avoided in all and none required a blood transfusion. Ten other patients had pectus repair either before cardiac repair (five patients) or without a subsequent cardiac operation. Another patient had a cardiac operation performed through a median sternotomy both before and after pectus repair, and the remaining patient, early in the series, had simultaneous banding of the main pulmonary artery and repair of pectus excavatum complicated by chest wall instability and a lethal intrathoracic hemorrhage. The experience indicates that congenital chest wall deformities can be safely and effectively repaired after early correction of congenital heart defects through a median sternotomy, although repair of the chest wall deformity after cardiac surgery also gives good results. However, in children who require an extracardiac conduit for repair of their congenital heart defect, we recommend initial repair of the pectus excavatum followed at 6 weeks or later by repair of the cardiac lesion to eliminate possible extrinsic compression of the conduit by the depressed sternum. We avoid simultaneous cardiac and pectus excavatum repair because of potential associated major complications.\r"

Patients with this category of empyema were treated with chest tubes, with two deaths. Class III (n = 40) is complicated empyema, with multiple loculations. Tube thoracostomy failed more often than not; decortication was required in 10 of 18 patients treated with prolonged tube drainage. Limited thoracotomy for drainage and placement of tubes was done in 22 patients. Five required extension of the thoracotomy and decortication. All 22 had resolution of the empyema with no additional procedures. Limited thoracotomy immediately or during the first week of treatment is recommended for all multiloculated or complex empyemas.\r"

Scanning electron microscopy of the fractured surface revealed evidence of a fatigue failure mechanism in the metal wire. The case is unique in that strut fractures affecting this prosthesis had only been observed previously in the range of 141 to 342 days after implantation. Morphological changes in this valve prompted reexamination of three other model 105 prostheses that had been recovered from the mitral area at necropsy or surgery 9 to 10 years after insertion in 1972 or 1973. All had been kept in dry storage. The three prostheses and the valve described above showed previously unrecognized cracks in the pyrolytic carbon coating of the struts, which form the cage that limits occluder movement. The defects were located at or near the base of struts, where they entered the sewing ring and were bent to pass into the strut supporting ring. We believe that the cracks in the carbon coating precede total strut fracture and postulate that they are needed for the metal wire to be subject to a fatigue failure mechanism.\r"

Contiguous sequences of electrocardiogram-triggered spin-echo images have been reconstructed in three-dimensional form to define the size and anatomic relationships to the great vessels and internal cardiac structures. Findings of magnetic resonance imaging were corroborated by angiographic and sector-scan echocardiographic studies and at operation. Individual scan slices were manually edited to separate the heart and great vessels from the blood within them and from extracardiac structures. Surface reconstruction software originally developed for craniofacial and orthopedic surgical planning was adapted for processing of cardiac magnetic resonance image sequences. Preoperative three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging reconstructions were obtained in patients with aortic coarctation with ventricular septal defect, hypoplastic left ventricle, pulmonary artery atresia with ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, partial atrioventricular canal defect with anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, and tetralogy of Fallot with peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. The reconstructions showed anatomic findings consistent with two-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, cineangiography, and intraoperative findings. The three-dimensional images have a format that is familiar and consistent with the gross intraoperative appearance of the heart and great vessels. These three-dimensional images can facilitate the interpretation of magnetic resonance scan findings for cardiac surgeons without the sacrifice of significant clinical information.\r"

This study tests the flow dynamics of venous catheters connected without a reservoir directly to a centrifugal pump.

In five sheep, flow was measured between catheters placed in the right atrium and inferior vena cava from peripheral sites. Catheter tip design (four types) does not affect flow within a simulated vein in vitro. Maximum pump flow is independent of filling pressures (6 to 21 mm Hg) in vitro and in vivo when the catheter tip is in a tank reservoir or the right atrium. However, when the catheter tip is within a collapsible segment or in the inferior vena cava, maximal flow is significantly influenced by filling pressure (6 to 18 mm Hg) and by the ratio of catheter outer diameter to venous diameter. At all filling pressures, maximal flow in vivo is significantly reduced when this ratio is greater than 0.5. During extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, central venous pressure and catheter/vein ratio, not catheter size alone, control flow through peripheral venous catheters.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-three consecutive patients with previous balloon atrial septostomy have undergone a Senning type repair of transposition of the great arteries without patch augmentation of the atrial septum. A technique was used that allows expansion of the atrial septum without the use of additional foreign or autogenous materials. The operative (30-day) mortality rate was 4.6% (2/43) with no late deaths. A mean follow-up of 20 months shows that 83% of the patients are in sinus rhythm and none of these patients have clinically detectable caval or pulmonary venous obstruction or baffle leaks. In patients selected for atrial switch, the Senning operation may be performed without patch augmentation of the septum. Performed by the method described herein, the operation provides predictable early and late results with a low prevalence of arrhythmias. Significant venous obstruction has not occurred.\r"

Eighteen of the procedures were unilateral and were performed to alleviate severe ischemia; the three bilateral procedures were done to relieve intermittent claudication. Regional perfusion index (RPI) was calculated for each foot (RPI = tcPO2 foot/tcPO2 chest) with the legs horizontal and with the legs elevated for 3 minutes (RPI3). The ankle/brachial index was calculated from ankle and arm systolic blood pressures. Limbs with severe ischemia had considerably decreased RPI and RPI3 before revascularization, whereas limbs affected by claudication had only a modest decrease in RPI but a pronounced decrease in RPI3. The tcPO2, RPI, and RPI3 increased substantially after revascularization.\r"

A comprehensive pathological examination is crucial and, with undifferentiated tumors, this will include immunohistology and/or electron microscopy. Ample properly processed tissue therefore must be provided. Time-consuming and costly radiographic and imaging studies should be avoided. No matter how extensive the evaluation, in a majority of cases, the primary site will never be found, so a selective search for treatable tumors is most appropriate and cost-effective. With adenocarcinomas, this will include prostate, breast, and ovary; for undifferentiated tumors, small cell bronchogenic carcinoma, lymphomas, and germ cell tumors. Table 4 summarizes recommended studies for diagnosing unknown primary undifferentiated or adenocarcinomas. Women with adenocarcinoma in axillary nodes without a primary site should be treated as having breast cancer. Estrogen and progesterone receptor assays are to be obtained on the axillary biopsy. High and midcervical nodes with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma can be treated effectively and, not infrequently, cured with surgery and radiation therapy, even if the primary site never is detected. If doubt remains, treatment should be selected that offers the best chance of significant palliation or cure--for example, cisplatin-based chemotherapy in possible extragonadal germ cell tumors.\r"

Successful revascularisation (by angioplasty in 8, and surgery in 3) improved blood pressure and renal function, and virtually eliminated pulmonary oedema. In a second series of 55 consecutive patients with azotaemia and renovascular hypertension, pulmonary oedema occurred in 13 (23%). Blood pressure and renal function were not significant predictors of pulmonary oedema, but coronary heart disease and bilateral (vs unilateral) renal artery stenosis were. Bilateral renal artery stenosis may be a specific and treatable predisposing factor to pulmonary oedema in azotaemic hypertensive patients.\r"

The excess included not only most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin, but also extended to paracetamol. New users of cimetidine who had not received analgesics in the preceding 2 years were preferentially given recently introduced NSAIDs if an NSAID was subsequently prescribed. Review of prior studies of analgesic use and ulcer diseases reveals a regular association between ulcer and preceding use of paracetamol, a drug for which no causal association to ulcer is thought to exist. General increases in use of analgesics by elderly dyspeptic patients may have given rise to artefact in reported associations between manifestations of ulcer disease and NSAIDs.\r"

The antigen or antigens are distinct from the Goodpasture antigen and have at least three components that bind IgG. The components are of molecular weight 185, 160, and 30-40 kD by high performance liquid chromatography, and, deaggregated, 69 to 30 kD by immunoblotting, with variation in affinity between patients. The autoantibody was detected more frequently in patients with IgG glomerular deposits, was present in sera intermittently, and was associated with clinical evidence of nephritis. IgG autoantibody secretion may be a component of the polyclonal B cell activation that accompanies infection-induced nephritis in IgA nephropathy.\r"

Spasm of the oesophageal muscle itself is probably not the cause, because pain and spasm are frequently not coincident. It is suggested instead that oesophageal ischaemia may be the cause of the pain, since the rewarming rate of the oesophagus after a standardised cold challenge was significantly longer in 9 patients with these motility disorders than in 21 normal controls. As rewarming time in other sites correlates with blood flow, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the oesophagus is ischaemic in these patients.\r"

HIV RNA was detected from seropositive subjects who had no symptoms, lymphadenopathy syndrome, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. DNA PCR of the samples used for RNA extraction showed that seventeen of eighteen (94%) contained HIV proviral DNA. Eleven (65%) of the seventeen DNA-positive samples were also positive for HIV RNA, including samples from four patients undergoing antiviral drug treatment. Serum HIV antigen assays detected only six (32%) of the nineteen PCR-positive samples. Owing to the speed and high sensitivity of PCR for HIV detection, this technique will be suitable for monitoring antiviral therapy and the virus load of people with HIV infections.\r"

Throat cultures for Chlamydia psittaci and serological tests for Chlamydia species, including strain TWAR, were obtained from 37 people. Cloacal smears and cultures of internal organs for C psittaci were taken from 9 dead birds. 62% of the people studied had symptoms, and 67% of the birds that died had previously been sick. Evidence for acute C psittaci infection was found in 81% of patients (30/37). Diagnosis was established in 22 by isolation of the causal organism from throat cultures and in 8 by positive IgM serology (reciprocal titre greater than or equal to 8) with evidence of acute seroconversion or clinical findings compatible with the disease, or both. No serological evidence for acute TWAR infection was found. All birds studied had microbiological evidence of C psittaci infection, and most had abnormal findings on necropsy.\r"
