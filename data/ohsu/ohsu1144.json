  ".W": "Severe upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious adverse effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the elderly are at increased risk of developing this complication. Bleeding episodes can be prevented. Replacing NSAIDs with acetaminophen may be appropriate when a simple analgesic is needed that eliminates the risk of GI bleeding. Using the lowest effective NSAID dose may decrease the incidence and severity of NSAID gastropathy. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists, sucralfate, and misoprostol have been studied for the prevention of NSAID gastropathy, but only misoprostol prevents mucosal injury in both the stomach and duodenum. Patients who have a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastric bleeding from NSAIDs are candidates for prophylactic measures. Although other patients are at risk, no one knows who should receive prophylactic therapy for NSAID gastropathy. Future studies should attempt to define patient populations that warrant prophylactic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "This study assesses whether administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) up to 8 hours after onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may result in a significant improvement in left ventricular function. Sixty patients were classified into 3 groups: group A (n = 21) received rt-PA within 4 hours from symptom onset; the remaining 39 patients, admitted between 4 and 8 hours, were randomized into 2 groups--group B (n = 19) received rt-PA, and group C (n = 21) was treated with conventional therapy. Coronary and left ventricular angiograms were recorded 8 to 10 days after rt-PA administration. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery was 76% in group A, and 63 and 35% in group B and C, respectively. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial perfusion grade was higher in group A and B than in group C (A vs C: p less than 0.005; B vs C: p less than 0.01). Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in group A (60.2 +/- 10%) and B (54.7 +/- 12%) compared with group C (44.2 +/- 12%) (A vs C: p less than 0.01; B vs C: p less than 0.05). Regional wall motion of the entire ischemic zone was better in group A and B than in group C (A vs C: p less than 0.001; B vs C: p less than 0.01). In contrast, the kinesis of the central ischemic zone was significantly better in group A than in both group B and C (A vs B: p less than 0.05; A vs C: p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During 1 year, 1,028 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were evaluated for eligibility for thrombolytic therapy. Of these, 221 patients (22%) were eligible for thrombolytic therapy under currently accepted criteria, 175 (79%) of them were correctly identified by emergency department physicians for thrombolytic therapy, and 160 were enrolled in the trial. Only 3 patients (2%) enrolled by emergency department physicians did not subsequently evolve documented AMI. In all, 807 patients (78%) were ineligible for thrombolytic therapy: 335 (33%) because of greater than or equal to 1 contraindications, 364 (36%) because of nondiagnostic electrocardiograms on presentation, and 105 (10%) because of age greater than 75 years, or greater than 6 hours of chest pain at presentation, or both. Mortality in treated patients at 14 days was 5.6%, and survival at 1 year was 92%. The mean time from hospital arrival to thrombolytic treatment was 55 +/- 27 minutes. Initial management of AMI with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the emergency department provided rapid and safe treatment comparable to that reported in trials that started treatment in the coronary care unit. The proportions of eligible patients could be increased from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3, if patients currently excluded only because of age greater than 75 years or because of greater than 6 hours of chest pain were offered treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Respiratory gas exchange data were collected from 77 men greater than 6 months after acute myocardial infarction. Maximal exercise was performed on an ergometer cycle programmed for a ramp protocol of 15 W/min. The gas exchange anaerobic threshold (ATge) was determined by analysis of the carbon dioxide elimination (VCO2) vs oxygen consumption (VO2) curve below a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.00 using a computerized algorithm. This value was estimated at the inflection of VCO2 from a line with a slope of 1 which intersects the VCO2 vs VO2 curve. The relation of the ATge to the lactate acidosis threshold was studied in 29 patients. The reproducibility of the ATge method was studied in 77 patients. Mean (+/- standard deviation) VO2 for the ATge was 905 +/- 220 vs 866 +/- 299 ml/min for the lactate acidosis threshold (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001). Mean VO2 at the ATge for test 1 was 968 +/- 225 vs 952 +/- 217 ml/min for test 2 (r = 0.71, p less than 0.001). Mean peak VO2 was 1,392 +/- 379 vs 912 +/- 202 ml/min at the ATge (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001). Results demonstrate that this ATge method correlates well with the lactate acidosis threshold, is reproducible, and should be useful as an objective measure of submaximal exercise performance.\r"

Five cases of benign lymphoid hyperplasia, one case of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, and one case of small noncleaved follicular center cell lymphoma had germline hybridization patterns when digested with Bam HI, Eco RI, and Hind III restriction endonucleases. Four cases of B-cell lymphoma and three cases of T-cell lymphoma had clearly detectable rearrangements of the genes for immunoglobulin or the T-cell receptor or both. One case of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy had a faint, clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor after digestion with Eco RI and Bam III. The authors conclude that biotinylated DNA probes can be useful for analyzing gene rearrangements in clinical specimens.\r"

The clonality of the bone marrow plasma cells was compared with results of serum and urine electrophoreses. Discordance was observed most frequently in cases in which a paraprotein was demonstrated, but no monoclonality was detected by immunoperoxidase (16 cases). Of these 16 cases, 9 had 5% or less bone marrow plasma cells. In only one case was the light chain class of the bone marrow plasma cells different from that of the paraprotein. If discordant cases with 5% or less plasma cells are eliminated, the overall concordance was 97%. The authors' findings indicate that immunohistologic studies for immunoglobulin light chains in Zenker-fixed decalcified bone marrow biopsy sections are reliable in the evaluation of patients with plasma cell proliferations when the marrow contains more than 5% plasma cells.\r"

To determine whether PTs and PTTs 1.1-1.5 times midrange normal levels and platelet counts 50-99 x 10(9)/L are associated with increased bleeding complications, hospital records of all patients who underwent percutaneous liver biopsy during 56 consecutive months (n = 291) were reviewed. Complete information was available for 177 inpatient procedures (155 standard, 22 fine needle). Overall, the frequency of bleeding complications in patients with platelet counts greater than or equal to 50 X 10(9)/L was 3.4% (6 of 175), with no significant difference between patients with mild hemostatic abnormalities and patients with normal parameters. These data suggest that prophylactic transfusions may not be necessary. One factor was highly associated with bleeding complications: a patient diagnosis of malignancy, 14% (7 of 50) compared with 0.8% (1 of 127) among other patients (P less than 0.001). These patients should be monitored closely after biopsy.\r"

The tumor replaced bone marrow and involved lymph nodes. Despite aggressive therapy, he died quickly of his leukemia/lymphoma.

  ".W": "During 1979-1989, the long-stay population in Massachusetts state psychiatric hospitals declined and then moderately increased, although to far below its initial 1979 level. The increase toward the end of the period was due to a growing number of patients admitted, an increase in the proportion of these new patients who were retained for 1 year or longer, and a decrease in discharges of long-stay patients, especially those hospitalized for 20 or more years. The last factor was particularly important and was due to the fact that the number of these very-long-stay patients had become so small by 1983 that the effect of their continued discharge on the total long-stay population was minimal. The authors point out that more community services, not more hospital beds, may be needed. They recommend that states assess the clinical needs of the long-stay population before determining how to allocate their resources to address this phenomenon.\r"

The activity of cochlear sodium-potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase in iron-deficient rats was slightly increased, compared to that in normal controls. These results suggest that iron deficiency would produce significant abnormalities of succinic dehydrogenase and peroxidase activity, which in turn would disturb cell respiration and initiate peroxidative damage to the inner ear cells, result in sensorineural hearing loss, or provide a pathologic basis for cochlear deafness.\r"

Molecular weight variants of synapsin II were present in 73% of samples from alcoholic individuals but in only 31% of samples from non-diseased individuals, thus confirming our two previous reports of an association between synapsin II variants and alcoholism. The presence of synapsin II variants was not correlated with age or nutritional state. Synapsin II variants were also present in 56% of samples from individuals with schizophrenia and 41% of samples from individuals with Huntington's disease. Synapsin II variants were present in samples from children and young adults, consistent with the possibility that synapsin II variants may reflect a genetically inherited trait. Synapsin II variants were not found in any of 18 rodent models of alcoholism, aging, or vitamin B deficiency, suggesting that synapsin II variants may be a uniquely human trait.\r"

  ".W": "To establish whether a transition from surgical to percutaneous placement of Greenfield filters was justified, a review of the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the two approaches was conducted. Between 1984 and 1989, 168 filters were placed in 169 patients, 48 surgically and 120 percutaneously. Placement was successful in 45 (94%) of the 48 surgical patients and 120 (99%) of the 121 percutaneous patients. Filter misplacement occurred in three (6%) surgical patients and no percutaneous patients. Clinically evident femoral vein thrombosis occurred in only four (5%) of the percutaneous patients, while inferior vena cava thrombosis occurred in three (3%) of the percutaneous patients. One pulmonary embolus occurred after percutaneous filter placement and resulted in death. The cost of percutaneous placement was 58% that of surgical placement. A retrospective review of the experience in our patient population indicates that safety, cost, and ease of insertion make the percutaneous approach the procedure of choice for Greenfield filter placement.\r"

In our experiments, we employed in vivo microvascular techniques to examine the effect of mucosally applied glucose on intestinal microvascular blood flow during hyperdynamic live Escherichia coli bacteremia in the rat. We observed a significant decrease in intestinal microvascular blood flow during bacteremia when the mucosa was suffused with a nonglucose solution. Blood flow was rapidly restored to above-baseline values after glucose was added. The restoration of blood flow resulted from dilation of arterioles at all branch orders and was associated with dilation of premucosal arterioles to above-baseline diameters. Our results show that glucose-induced absorptive hyperemia restores intestinal blood flow during live E coli bacteremia. Restoration of intestinal microvascular blood flow may be a contributing factor to the improved maintenance of mucosal integrity associated with enteral feeding.\r"

There was a significant decline in atrial natriuretic peptide during sinus rhythm. Plasma concentrations of the peptide were significantly higher during tachycardia in seven infants under 1 year than in the six older children. The heart rates and the duration of tachycardia were not significantly different in the two age groups. Cardiac failure was present in five of seven children under 18 weeks of age during tachycardia but in none of the older children. The plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide did not significantly correlate with duration of tachycardia or heart rate. If tachycardia occurs in young infants the low functional reserve capacity of the developing heart leads to cardiac failure more frequently and it is likely that this was the cause of the significantly higher plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide in the younger children.\r"

Simultaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) (scalp, sphenoidal and foramen oval) recording, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a fixed head position, permits the projection of brain structures and the source localized from MEG into a three-dimensional coordinate system. From 8 patients investigated it can be clearly seen that the method is of diagnostic relevance for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Results are demonstrated for 3 patients with interesting findings concerning the anatomical correlation with source localization. The findings indicate that MRI-correlated magnetic source localization by means of multichannel recordings provides important advantages in epilepsy research. (1) Increased precision permits noninvasive localization. Deeper sources in the temporal lobe are localized from MEG combined with scalp or minor invasive EEG. (2) Investigation time is considerably shortened. (3) Single events can be localized for supplementary presurgical information concerning the three-dimensional anatomical localization of focal epileptic activity in the brain.\r"

  ".W": "18F-dopa and S-11C-nomifensine (NMF) are positron emitting tracers whose caudate and putamen uptake reflects striatal dopamine storage capacity and the integrity of dopamine reuptake sites, respectively. Using these two tracers, the integrity of the presynaptic striatal dopaminergic system has been studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome) who had an akinetic-rigid syndrome that was poorly responsive to L-dopa, autonomic failure, and cerebellar ataxia. PET findings for the 10 MSA patients were compared with those for 13 age-matched controls, 8 subjects with L-dopa responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), and 7 subjects with pure autonomic failure (PAF). Influx constants, Ki, reflecting specific 18F-dopa uptake into striatal tissue, were severely reduced in the putamen and caudate of the 10 MSA subjects (mean putamen Ki 0.005 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls; mean caudate Ki 0.007 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls). Reduction of putamen, but not caudate, 18F-dopa uptake correlated with severity and duration of locomotor disability. Eight patients with PD, and a similar degree and duration of locomotor disability to the patients with MSA, demonstrated equal impairment of mean putamen 18F-dopa uptake, but significant preservation of mean caudate function. The 7 PAF patients had normal mean levels of putamen and caudate 18F-dopa uptake, although 1 individual PAF patient had significantly impaired striatal function. The MSA and PD groups of subjects both showed significantly reduced levels of specific striatal S-11C-NMF binding, again caudate function being relatively preserved in PD. It is concluded that in both MSA and PD there is a parallel decline of striatal dopamine storage capacity and reuptake site integrity, probably reflecting a loss of nigrostriatal nerve terminals. Caudate function is relatively preserved in PD compared with MSA. The majority of PAF patients have an intact nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, suggesting that PAF is a condition distinct from PD and MSA in spite of some pathological similarities. PET is capable of detecting subclinical nigrostriatal involvement in PAF patients when this is present.\r"

Antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilaments labelled neuronal cell bodies in the nucleus dorsalis and anterior horns. Axonal swellings showed positive staining for ubiquitin, but ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions were not evident. The presence of phosphorylated neurofilaments in the neuronal cell bodies and of ubiquitination of axonal swellings may be indicators of interrupted axonal transport. The changes found in intracellular proteins in neurons after trauma do not resemble those found in motor neuron disease, suggesting that the intraneuronal ubiquitinated inclusions may have a unique significance in the cytopathology of that disorder.\r"

Thirty catheters were radiographically proved to be obstructed by thrombus and had not responded to at least one instillation of 5000 units of urokinase. All catheters were treated with a 12-hour infusion of urokinase at the rate of 40,000 units/hour. The obstructing thrombus was either eliminated or reduced in size in all instances and full function was restored in all but one catheter. No bleeding complications were seen. Six patients with obstructed catheters also had symptoms of subclavian vein thrombosis. All patients with symptoms of subclavian vein obstruction became asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy even though no attempt at dissolving the thrombus obstructing the subclavian vein was made. A 12-hour infusion of low doses of urokinase can safely salvage function of obstructed catheters that otherwise may require replacement. Patients with concomitant subclavian vein thrombosis become asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy without need to dissolve the obstructing thrombus.\r"

These cell lines showed different sensitivities to each of the above anti-tumor drugs. The concentrations required for 50% growth-inhibition (IC50) after 2 hours of exposure were 0.096 to 0.35 micrograms/ml for MMC, 0.0074 to 0.0076 micrograms/ml for ACR, 0.033 to 0.23 micrograms/ml for ADR, 0.35 to 1.9 micrograms/ml for cisplatin, and 21 to 42 micrograms/ml for 5FU, IC50 of each anti-tumor drug decreased significantly after 48 hours of exposure. The combination of any two out of MMC, ACR, and 5FU showed synergistic inhibition of the growth of PK-1 and PK-8 cell lines. These results show that MMC, ACR, ADR, cisplatin, and 5FU have sufficient anti-tumor effect against six human pancreatic cancer cell lines even at clinically achievable concentrations and exposure times, and chemotherapy for pancreatic cancers requires naturally effective drug delivery into cancer tissues.\r"

  ".U": "91059475\r", 
  ".W": "The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is poorly developed in the rat heart compared with other organs, since the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, is low. As a consequence, the available pool of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate and the rate of adenine nucleotide biosynthesis are limited. Isoproterenol, 24 hours after subcutaneous administration at 0.1, 1, and 25 mg/kg, stimulated the activity of G-6-PDH in whole hearts dose-dependently from 4.3 +/- 0.16 (control) to 6.6 +/- 0.35, 10.3 +/- 0.82, and 11.5 +/- 0.56 units/g protein, respectively. The activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, another of the enzymes in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, remained unchanged. G-6-PDH activity started to increase 12 hours after isoproterenol application, when the glycogenolytic and functional response was over, and reached a peak value between 24 and 48 hours. This stimulating effect was also demonstrated in cardiac myocytes that were isolated 28 hours after isoproterenol application. beta-receptor blockade with atenolol reduced the isoproterenol-induced increase in cardiac G-6-PDH activity by 90%. Cycloheximide, which inhibits translation, and actinomycin D, which interferes with transcription, attenuated it by 83% and 78%, respectively. These results indicate that cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors and enzyme protein synthesis are involved in this effect. Other beta-sympathomimetic agents such as dopamine, dobutamine, fenoterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline also stimulated myocardial G-6-PDH activity in a time- and dose-related manner. The calcium antagonist D 600 (gallopamil) reduced the isoproterenol-elicited stimulation by 65%, and verapamil blunted the fenoterol-induced increase by 50%. This suggests that Ca2+ ions also contribute to the stimulation of the cardiac oxidative pentose phosphate pathway.\r"

The model consisted of a whole-blood clot produced in a 1-cm isolated femoral arterial segment with superimposed endothelial damage and distal high-grade stenosis. rt-PA was injected as an intravenous bolus of 0.45 mg/kg body wt at 15-minute intervals until recanalization, or up to a maximum of four boluses. In seven rabbits given an intravenous injection of 17 mg/kg aspirin, rt-PA induced transient reflow in only one animal. In seven rabbits that received intravenous heparin (200 units/kg over 60 minutes), rt-PA administration produced reflow in five animals, which was persistent in two rabbits. Combined administration of aspirin and heparin in seven rabbits was associated with similar rt-PA-induced recanalization. rt-PA administration in six rabbits given intravenous Argatroban (100 micrograms/kg/min for 60 minutes) caused recanalization in five, with persistent patency in three. In six rabbits given aspirin and Argatroban, rt-PA caused recanalization in all, with persistent patency in five animals. Reflow occurred significantly more rapidly with Argatroban (14 +/- 7 minutes) than with heparin (35 +/- 11 minutes), reflow was obtained with fewer boluses of rt-PA in combination with Argatroban (median value of one bolus) than with heparin (median value, three boluses), and reocclusion after reflow was less frequent with Argatroban (0 of 11 versus 5 of 10 rabbits). Furthermore, the degree of thrombolysis determined by pathological analysis was significantly more extensive with Argatroban than with heparin, and patency persisted during a 3-hour observation period, despite elimination of Argatroban from the circulation. Thus, Argatroban, relative to heparin, enhances and sustains thrombolysis with rt-PA. It may offer promise as an adjunctive agent for thrombolytic therapy of arterial thrombosis.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of irradiation on the pullout strength of a porous implant in the canine model. A custom-designed titanium fiber metal-coated cylinder was implanted into the distal femurs of 12 dogs. One femur of each dog was irradiated with 10 Gy, given in four 2.5-Gy daily fractions beginning one day after surgery. Serial bone scans were performed at one, two, four, and six weeks postoperatively. At six weeks, the femurs were harvested, and eight were randomly selected for mechanical testing. Scintigraphic evaluation showed a significant reduction in uptake at one and two weeks in the irradiated limb, but this had returned to normal at four and six weeks. The failure to pullout was significantly less in the irradiated limb compared with the control limb six weeks postoperatively. In this canine model, the pullout strength of the titanium fiber implant was significantly reduced by a dose of radiation commonly used in the prevention of heterotopic ossification. If irradiation is chosen for prophylaxis, either the porous implant should be adequately shielded or a cemented implant should be utilized.\r"

This study evaluates the clinical utility of the metabolic cart in an urban university hospital setting. Twenty-six studies were performed on each of 26 patients (18 surgical, 8 medical) using an MMC Horizon metabolic cart. Although 58% of patients were overweight, 42% were still shown to have a kwashiorkorlike pattern of malnutrition. Three patients demonstrated a marasmic-like pattern. Fifteen percent of studies showed patients to be hypometabolic and 62% hypermetabolic. Harris-Benedict resting energy expenditure, based on actual or ideal body weight, underestimated needs; however, addition of a metabolic activity factor overestimated needs. Only 32% of patients were fed appropriately; 41% were underfed, and 27% were overfed. Urine area nitrogen correlated poorly with energy expenditure. Measured RQ appropriately reflected substrate utilization in 77% of studies; multiple factors may have caused differences between measured and predicted RQ in 23%. Use of the metabolic cart determines precisely the metabolic state, identifies problems with substrate utilization, and enables the physician to design the most efficacious nutritional regimen.\r"

  ".W": "Body N balance, 3-methylhistidine (MEH) excretion, amino acid (AA) plasma concentration, and fluxes across the leg were investigated both during fasting and during parenteral nutrition of injured patients in order to better understand protein-sparing mechanisms induced by metabolic support in the whole body and in skeletal muscle. Patients were randomized to receive 15 or 30 kcal/kg.day coupled with 0.30 g of N either with standard or branch-chain (BC)-enriched AA solutions. During fasting, patients were highly catabolic (N balance -14.7 +/- 1.2 g N/m2.day, MEH excretion 422 +/- 25 mumol/m2.day) and showed a high efflux of AA N from the leg (5.08 +/- 2.1 g N/m2.day) without difference between the groups. During treatment, body N balance (-5.55 +/- 0.88, p less than .001) and MEH excretion (284 +/- 20, p less than .001) were significantly reduced without difference among the groups; also, AA N leg efflux (2.64 +/- 0.47, p less than .001) was reduced. Moreover, considering the effect of calorie load, patients receiving 30 kcal/kg.day showed a lower efflux of total AA N and of some AA considered as markers of muscle protein catabolism, such as phe, lys, met, and glu. The main difference between solutions was in the efflux of BCAA; particularly, val and leu efflux was turned into uptake in the BCAA group. No significant difference among the groups was found in N balance and MEH excretion during treatment. In brief, muscle catabolism was reduced in an amount dependent on glucose and insulin load, but it was not influenced by BCAA supply. Whole body net protein catabolism was reduced through different mechanisms, either an increased visceral N retention or a decreased muscle N loss. However, muscle N loss was never abolished even in the high calorie groups.\r"

To evaluate the accuracy of this assumption, five normal volunteers, ten hospitalized postoperative patients with head and neck cancer, and 24 ICU patients were given hypertonic (690 mosm), low residue, lactose-free tube feedings starting at 30 kcal/kg.day. There was no prior history of diarrhea in any of the groups studied. There was a significant difference in albumin levels between the three groups, with an average albumin of 2.8 g/dl in the ICU patient group; different from 4.5 g/dl present in both the normal volunteer and non-ICU hospitalized patient groups (general linear models procedure from SAS, p less than .05) (Duncan test). Diarrhea was not present in the normal volunteers or non-ICU patients during the feedings, but did occur in 3/24 ICU patients. This difference was not significant. The three patients with diarrhea had an average albumin level of 3.0 g/dl, while the other ICU patients had an average albumin of 2.7 g/dl. We conclude that hypertonic NG tube feedings do not cause diarrhea in normal volunteers or postoperative head and neck cancer patients. However, in a small statistically insignificant percent of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, this regimen may cause diarrhea although no risk factors can be identified.\r"

Death is often due to pulmonary failure (adult respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]). Death and ARDS have been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and microclots in the lungs. Dissolution of the microclots after trauma can be achieved by activation of endogenous plasmin. Nine pigs were anesthetized for 48 h. Trauma was administered by 60 standard blows to each thigh resulting in a bruise of muscle but no skin, bone, or major vessel injury. Nutrition and respiration were maintained at normal levels. All nine pigs died with severe lung pathology and low PaO2. Ten other traumatized pigs were treated with a plasminogen activator iv 4 h after trauma. Five of these were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and five with urokinase. All treated pigs survived 48 h and maintained a normal PaO2. Autopsy showed minimal lung pathology.\r"

DESIGN: The design was a case-control, cohort analytic, nonrandomized controlled survey of case series before and after endoscopic procedures. SETTING: A referral-based surgery and oncology practice at one hospital's laser center. PATIENTS: We studied a sequential sample of 82 patients in the age range from 35 to 92 years, with malignant and benign, primary and metastatic, partially and completely obstructing esophageal (15 patients) and endobronchial (67 patients) tumors. INTERVENTIONS: A total of 229 diagnostic, laser treatment, and follow-up endoscopic procedures was performed under general or local anesthesia (46 esophagoscopies and 183 bronchoscopies). The latter group consisted of 29 cases of general and 154 cases of local topical anesthesia. The last group involved 37 diagnostic and toilet bronchoscopies, 86 cases of YAG-laser tumor ablation, and 31 cases of PDT. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Direct-reading electrode measurements of arterial blood, sampled before and immediately after the endoscopic procedure, revealed statistically significant (p less than 0.001) increases in PaCO2 (200 of 229 cases) and decreases in pH (195 of 229 cases) and PaO2 (215 of 229 cases). These findings were similar after bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy, general and local anesthesia (only the decrease in pH was less pronounced in the latter case), and explorative endoscopies and different laser treatments and did not correlate with the total duration of the procedure within the wide time range of 7 to 210 minutes. The initial preoperative level of PaCO2 was considerably higher and the level of PaO2 was significantly lower in patients with endobronchial tumors, as compared to patients with esophageal cancer. A strong, inverse linear relationship was found between the perioperative changes in PaO2 and its initial level and between PaCO2 and pH changes. CONCLUSIONS: The PDT for esophageal and endobronchial malignancies is no more harmful for acid-base metabolism and respiratory functions than YAG-laser tumor ablation or any other common, nonlaser endoscopic procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing atmospheres of absolute pressure (ATA) on the cardiopulmonary system results in a marked diuresis. The present investigation was designed to determine if the diuresis observed with increasing ATA is associated with increased release of the N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) prohormone that contains two potent diuresis-producing hormones consisting of amino acids (aa) 1-30 (pro ANF 1-30; long-acting sodium stimulator) and aa 31-67 (pro ANF 31-67; vessel dilator) of this 126 aa prohormone. Seven healthy volunteers (mean age, 31 years) had the circulating concentration of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 ATA in a monoplace hyperbaric chamber by two specific and sensitive radioimmunoassays that immunologically recognize (1) the whole 98 aa N-terminus and (2) the midportion of the N-terminus consistent with aa 31-67 (pro ANF 31-67). With increasing ATA from 1 (sea level) to 2 (equivalent to 33 feet of sea water), the circulating concentrations of both the whole N-terminus and pro ANF 31-67 increased threefold. At 3 ATA (66 feet of sea water), their circulating concentrations increased sixfold over their concentrations, at 1 ATA. With the addition of 100 percent O2 while at 3 and 2 ATA, the circulating concentrations of both the whole N-terminus and pro ANF 31-67 immediately decreased to their prehyperbaric ATA levels and remained there with further decompression to 1 ATA and removal of O2 supplementation. The increased circulating concentration of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone containing two peptides with potent diuretic effects during increasing atmospheres of absolute pressure may help to explain the diuresis that has been observed with increasing ATA.\r"

Changing from VCV to PCV was associated with significant improvements in PaO2, oxygen delivery, and tissue oxygen consumption. Peak inspiratory pressure fell. There were no significant changes in other cardiorespiratory values, such as arterial blood pressure, nor in ventilatory measurements, such as mean airway pressure, associated with the use of PCV. These results suggest that PCV may be a beneficial ventilatory modality in the treatment of severe respiratory failure since it results in improvement in arterial oxygenation, tissue oxygen delivery and utilization without any concomitant adverse effects on other hemodynamic or ventilatory factors.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the magnitude, duration, and associated factors of perioperative changes in pulmonary function, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 145 patients who required preoperative mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure before undergoing 200 surgical procedures. Patients were grouped into five pulmonary diagnostic categories: (1) adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 49); (2) pneumonia (n = 20); (3) atelectasis (n = 65); (4) congestive heart failure (n = 11); and (5) acute ventilatory failure (n = 55). Sixty patients underwent intra-abdominal surgery, 135 patients required surgery on the periphery, and five patients had a thoracotomy. For all patients, PaO2/FIO2 declined significantly from 321 mm Hg (mean) preoperatively to 258 mm Hg intraoperatively, and shunt fraction (Qs/QT) increased from 0.16 to 0.23 without a significant change in PaCO2. The magnitude of the increase in Qs/QT did not differ among pulmonary diagnostic groups. Preoperatively, patients undergoing laparotomy had lower PaO2/FIO2 (278 vs 340) and higher Qs/QT (0.19 vs 0.14) than patients requiring surgery on the periphery. Intraoperatively, Qs/QT increased more during abdominal procedures than during peripheral procedures. Intraoperative hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 less than 80 mm Hg) occurred during 13 procedures. Hypoxemic patients had a mean increase in Qs/QT of 0.20 (0.25 preoperatively to 0.45 intraoperatively), and a significant increase in PaCO2 from 38 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg intraoperatively). In general, these patients had ARDS (n = 10), sepsis (n = 10), a laparotomy (n = 9), and intraoperative mechanical ventilation via the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator (n = 8), a commonly used operating room ventilator. Their preoperative peak airway pressure (54 cm H2O) and minute ventilation (20 L/min) requirements exceeded the capabilities of the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator and likely contributed to impaired gas exchange intraoperatively. Within the first several hours postoperatively, PaO2/FIO2 recovered to preoperative levels in all patients, even in those who had severe intraoperative hypoxemia develop and who underwent laparotomy. We conclude that most patients with acute respiratory failure receiving preoperative mechanical ventilation experienced mild-to-moderate deterioration in intraoperative pulmonary oxygen exchange that rapidly returned to preoperative levels after surgery. We recommend that necessary surgery not be postponed by concern that pulmonary function will be worsened by surgery and anesthesia.\r"

In previous studies in patients with thrombotic disease, rt-PA has been shown to be an effective thrombolytic agent when administered by continuous infusion over a period between 90 minutes and 8 hours. To determine whether a short course regimen of rt-PA can achieve thrombolysis, a double-blind randomized trial has been conducted in which patients with objectively established acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism who were receiving heparin were allocated to either a 2-minute infusion of rt-PA at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (33 patients) or saline placebo (25 patients). Perfusion lung scanning was used to assess the change in pulmonary perfusion at 24 hours and seven days post-study drug administration. Thirty-four percent of the rt-PA patients had a greater than 50 percent resolution in the perfusion defect at 24 hours compared to 12 percent of placebo patients (p = 0.026). At 24 hours, the mean relative improvement in the perfusion defect was 37.0 percent in rt-PA treated patients compared to 18.8 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.017). By day 7, no difference in lung scan resolution was detected between the groups. There were no major bleeds in either group nor were there any differences in transfusion requirements between groups. Minor bleeding occurred in 15 of the rt-PA patients mainly at angiogram-catheter insertion and venipuncture sites. These results suggest that a bolus regimen of rt-PA produces accelerated thrombolysis and provides an alternative and convenient approach to thrombolytic therapy in patients with pulmonary embolism.\r"

A short time later, the vein grafts were found to be occluded, and we subsequently performed multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using tPA as an adjuvant to oral warfarin sodium therapy with excellent results. We conclude that heparin-induced thromboses in the pulmonary arteries are amenable to thrombolytic therapy, including tPA, whereas this regimen appears to have little effect on saphenous vein grafts. We also found that a combination of warfarin and thrombolytic therapy is an alternative regimen for heparin-intolerant patients who require PTCA.\r"

In a positron-emission tomography (PET) study, we demonstrated a reduction of the cortical benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor density in the epileptic foci of patients with partial epileptic seizures. In the present study, we used the same method in 10 patients with primary generalized epilepsy to determine whether an altered BZD receptor binding could also be demonstrated in this patient group. The [11C]-labeled BZD receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 was used as ligand. Receptor affinities and densities were calculated in various cortical regions and then compared with the values from corresponding \"nonepileptic\" regions in the previously examined partial epilepsy patients. Focal alterations of the BZD receptor density or affinity were not demonstrated in patients with generalized epilepsy. This patient group had a slight tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density, however, as compared with corresponding values from 10 patients with partial epilepsy. Our results strongly suggest that a focal alteration of cortical inhibition is not a prominent feature of human generalized epilepsy. The observed tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density may be a consequence of diffusely impaired cortical inhibition. Further investigations of this issue are therefore indicated.\r"

Epileptic discharges were noted in waking only in 8.7%, in waking as well as sleep in 28.8%, and in sleep only in 25%. Generalized, partly irregular, and slow spike-wave complexes were found, twice with lateral emphasis. Spike-wave complexes were recorded in 72% of 50 siblings of patients with idiopathic absence and in 46.7% of 30 siblings of patients with symptomatic absence. One epileptic discharge was observed every 108.6 s on the average, without striking differences between siblings of patients with idiopathic (99.7 s) and symptomatic absence (119.3 s). Without any differences between siblings of children with idiopathic and symptomatic absence, the most epileptic discharges were activated in sleep stages C and D, followed by stages A and B. The highest activation rate was observed in the 7-14-year-old group (73.5%) and to a somewhat lesser degree in the group between 15 and 20 years of age (66.7%); fewer epileptic discharges were recorded in younger (25%) and older patients (28.6%). The higher activation rates in the male sex were significant only in siblings of patients with idiopathic absence. Although only five patients (13.2%) were photosensitive, a photosensitivity was found in 24% of siblings of children with idiopathic absence and in 20% of siblings of patients with symptomatic absence. Three siblings of patients with idiopathic absence also had absence seizures; in one of them a febrile seizure occurred at an earlier age. All of them showed generalized spike wave discharges in waking as well as sleep. Occipital theta delta activity with generalization was observed more frequently in siblings of patients with idiopathic absence (82.2%) than in those of patients with symptomatic absence (63.6%). Our waking and sleep EEG recordings prove that concerning etiology-genetic factors play a striking role in idiopathic absence, but are also of considerable significance in the symptomatic types.\r"

In 26 of 69 (37.68%) siblings, epileptic discharges were observed. These were recorded only in waking in 1 subject (1.5%), in waking and sleep in 13 (18.8%), and in sleep only in 12 (17.4%). The greatest number of epileptic discharges was noted in waking during hyperventilation (52.4%) and in sleep stage C (88%). Foci were recorded in only 4 (5.8%) of the 26 cases with epileptic discharges, and generalized spike-wave complexes were recorded in 22 (31.9%). In one sibling, the sharp-wave focus was located in the right centrotemporal area, in a second in the left occipital, and in a third in the left frontal region with spreading to the centrotemporal; in the fourth, two independent foci were observed in the left and right centrotemporal area. One epileptic discharge was observed every 74.9 s in waking and every 150.9 s in sleep. Epileptic activity was greatest in the group between 5 and 12 years of age (54.3%). The same activation rates were noted in siblings of patients with (47.2%) and without seizures (42.9%), and no differences were noted in siblings with (40%) or without (37.5%) seizures. Family history and sex of the siblings of patient did not play a role in the rate of activation. An autosomal dominant inheritance is assumed, but further investigations are necessary.\r"

The endometrial defect was corrected in 7 of the 15 (46.7%) patients during the first treated cycle. Hormonal levels were similar in control and treatment cycles. Two of 5 patients with no additional infertility factors except luteal phase deficiency (LPD) became pregnant and carried to term singleton pregnancies. In 5 additional infertile patients with normal luteal function as assessed by endometrial histological study (2 cycles) and hormone measurements (first study cycle), a third biopsy was performed in a consecutive cycle under pFSH administration. In no case was the normal secretory pattern impaired. It is concluded that (1) some forms of LPD may be successfully treated by early follicular pFSH therapy and (2) pFSH does not alter the normal endometrial secretory pattern.\r"

Hormonal and clinical evaluations were conducted during treatment and for a 6-month follow-up period. Serum 17 beta-estradiol levels were sharply suppressed. Luteinizing hormone was also decreased, whereas follicle-stimulating hormone, after an initial fall, gradually rose to pretreatment levels. Ovarian androgenic production was less inhibited, total testosterone being the only significantly suppressed hormone. There was a marked improvement of signs and symptoms of endometriosis and a 47.3% reduction of laparoscopic score. The results of this study suggest that goserelin depot provides a very good suppression of ovarian estrogen production and is highly effective in decreasing the symptoms of endometriosis with an acceptable compliance by the patient.\r"

Forty patients were randomly allocated to receive 6 months of either IN buserelin acetate (n = 21) or SC buserelin acetate (n = 19). Four patients did not complete the study and were excluded from statistical analysis. Fibroid regression occurred in all 36 patients. Overall regression to 66% or less of the initial fibroid volume occurred in 70% of subjects. There was no significant difference in fibroid shrinkage between the two administration routes. A significant positive correlation was found between initial fibroid size and subsequent fibroid regression, with larger tumors being more likely to shrink than smaller fibroids. No correlation was found between the patient's age and the extent of fibroid regression.\r"

Four days after onset, this change was not evident if NaCNBH3 was omitted during enzyme preparations (indicating reversibility). Ninety days after onset, NaCNBH3 reduction was not necessary to see the change in ATP hydrolysis kinetics (indicating nonreversibility). The change in steady-state ATP hydrolysis was similar to that reported earlier for Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase of the lens epithelium and kidney medulla of diabetic individuals and for two in vitro glycosylation models. Our study also showed that the affinities of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase for K+ are altered, and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase-dependent K+ occlusion is inhibited in diabetic and galactosemic animals. Because K+ occlusion is required for efficient K+ transport, this finding supports previous in vitro studies that indicated that glycosylation inhibits pump-dependent K+ transport. Furthermore, our study suggested an irreversible impairment of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase function in the diabetic BB Wistar rat as early as 15 days after onset, even when blood glucose was maintained at 6.7 mM by daily insulin injection.\r"

Therefore, cholinergic function was examined in two gut smooth muscle preparations from control, 30-day, and 6-month streptozotocin-diabetic and similarly diabetic rats that had received continuous treatment with an aldose reductase inhibitor, ponalrestat. Responses of terminal ileum longitudinal muscle to transmural nerve stimulation were depressed in preparations from untreated 30-day diabetic animals. Responses to exogenous acetylcholine were also depressed, by at least the same extent, in preparations from both 30-day and 6-month diabetic groups. Ponalrestat treatment prevented both changes in the 30-day study but did not prevent a depression of responses to acetylcholine in the 6-month study. Neither diabetes nor ponalrestat affected responses of esophageal muscularis mucosa to electrical stimulation or to exogenous acetylcholine. These observations suggest a change in the smooth muscle and/or noncholinergic innervation rather than in the cholinergic nerves of the ileal preparation. Cholinergic function in the ileum did not, therefore, seem to be an appropriate model of diabetic neuropathy.\r"

  ".W": "Concentration- and voltage-dependent 45Ca transport was measured across the rat duodenum and jejunum. Mucosa-to-serosa calcium transport across the short-circuited tissue exhibits a saturable component, whereas serosa-to-mucosa calcium flux in both segments is linear to the calcium concentration between 0.125 mmol/L and 10 mmol/L. Calcium is absorbed in the duodenum at concentrations between 0.125 mmol/L and 2.5 mmol/L but is secreted in the jejunum at all concentrations. The simultaneously measured paracellular marker [3H]mannitol at all calcium concentrations is secreted in both segments. The study across clamped preparations shows that (a) only mucosa-to-serosa calcium flux has a voltage-independent cellular component; (b) serosa-to-mucosa calcium flux is totally voltage dependent, i.e., diffusive and probably restricted to the paracellular pathway; (c) diffusive calcium flux in the duodeum is equal in both directions; and (d) diffusive serosa-to-mucosa flux in the jejunum is higher than the corresponding flux in the opposite direction, suggesting that calcium passively is secreted in the jejunum as the consequence of a preference of the paracellular serosa-to-mucosa calcium movement caused by \"anomalous solvent drag effect.\" 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] stimulates serosa-to-mucosa and more pronounced mucosa-to-serosa calcium flux and increases calcium absorption in the duodenum and abolishes calcium secretion in the jejunum. 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates cellular mucosa-to-serosa calcium flux in the duodenum only but has no effect on cellular calcium in the jejunum. However, the vitamin increases bidirectional diffusive calcium fluxes across both segments. Tissue resistance is decreased and the flux of the paracellular marker mannitol in both directions is increased, suggesting that 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates diffusive calcium flux across both segments by increasing the paracellular permeability. Dexamethasone inhibits cellular mucosa-to-serosa calcium flux and abolishes calcium absorption in the duodenum only but has no effect on cellular calcium flux in the jejunum. The glucosteroid has no influence on diffusive calcium flux in the duodenum but increases voltage-dependent bidirectional calcium flux across the jejunum. Simultaneously, the flux of the paracellular probe mannitol in both directions across the jejunum is increased, whereas mannitol flux in the duodenum is unresponsive to dexamethasone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The ultrasound probe was positioned at the level of the transpyloric plane to visualize the antrum, pylorus, and proximal duodenum simultaneously and thereafter vertically to visualize the antrum, superior mesenteric vein, and aorta simultaneously. The motility was videotaped for 15 minutes. The antroduodenal coordination, frequency and amplitude of antral contractions, and size of antral area were reduced, whereas the time during which the pylorus was wide open (greater than 5 mm) was increased after enprostil. It is concluded that antroduodenal motility can easily be visualized by ultrasonography. Therapeutic doses of enprostil impair antroduodenal peristalsis and coordination and open the pylorus in healthy subjects.\r"

During an 11-day time-control infusion of isotonic saline vehicle (100 microliters/hr), mean arterial pressure remained stable. Chronic infusion of atriopeptin-(103-126) decreased mean arterial pressure progressively over the first 3 days; then mean arterial pressure progressively rose to control level over the following 3 days and remained at control level for the remainder of the experiment.

Inspiratory motor drive was assessed by measuring the electromyogram of left and right diaphragm, left parasternal, and mylohyoid muscles in five protocols. 1) Three boluses (2 ml) of capsaicin (1, 10, and 50 micrograms/ml) were injected 30 min apart. Only the 50-micrograms/ml injection elicited a significant increase in arterial pressure, heart rate, and inspiratory motor drive. 2) Repeated doses of capsaicin were tested. The pressor and hyperpneic responses were weakened. 3) High doses of capsaicin (100 and 500 micrograms/ml) were given. Hyperpneic and pressor responses were similar to those elicited by the 50-micrograms/ml dose. 4) When the left phrenic nerve was sectioned, the pressor and hyperpneic responses to the 50-micrograms/ml injection were abolished. 5) Capsaicin (50 micrograms/ml) was infused into the arterial supply of the in situ vascularly isolated and innervated gastrocnemius. Arterial pressure, breathing frequency, and inspiratory motor drive to all inspiratory muscles increased significantly and to a greater degree than in the diaphragm. In conclusion, diaphragmatic thin-fiber afferents have an excitatory effect on the inspiratory motor drive and arterial pressure that is similar to that seen in limb muscles.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study is to outline a common mistake made when the rate of oxidation of exogenous substrates during prolonged exercise is computed using 13C naturally labeled substrates. The equation proposed and commonly used in the computation does not take into account that exercise and/or exogenous substrate ingestion modifies the composition of the mixture of endogenous substrates oxidized and, consequently, the isotopic composition of CO2 arising from oxidation of endogenous substrates. The recovery of 13C and the amount of exogenous substrate oxidized are thus overestimated. An adequate procedure for the computation of exogenous substrate oxidation taking into account changes in isotopic composition of CO2 arising from oxidation of endogenous substrates is suggested. Results from a pilot experiment (4 subjects) using this procedure indicate that over 2 h of exercise (66% of maximal O2 uptake), with ingestion of 60 g of glucose, 39 +/- 4 g of glucose were oxidized. Estimates made without taking into account changes in isotopic composition of CO2 arising from oxidation of endogenous substrates range between 70 +/- 8 and 44 +/- 3 g depending on 1) the isotopic composition of exogenous glucose and 2) the isotopic composition of expired CO2 taken as reference (rest or exercise without glucose ingestion). These observations suggest that results from previous studies of exogenous substrate oxidation during exercise using 13C labeling should be used with caution.\r"

To investigate the effects of inspired air temperature on upper airway dilator muscle activity during nose breathing, we compared phasic genioglossus electromyograms (EMGgg) in eight normal awake adults breathing cold dry or warm humidified air through the nose. EMGgg was measured with peroral bipolar electrodes during successive trials of cold air (less than or equal to 15 degrees C) and warm air (greater than or equal to 34 degrees C) nasal breathing and quantified for each condition as percent activity at baseline (room temperature). In four of the subjects, the protocol was repeated after topical nasal anesthesia. For all eight subjects, mean EMGgg was greater during cold air breathing than during baseline (P less than 0.005) or warm air breathing (P less than 0.01); mean EMGgg during warm air breathing was not significantly changed from baseline. Nasal anesthesia significantly decreased the mean EMGgg response to cold air breathing. Nasal airway inspiratory resistance, measured by posterior rhinomanometry in six subjects under similar conditions, was no different for cold or warm air nose breathing [cold 1.4 +/- 0.7 vs. warm 1.4 +/- 1.1 (SD) cmH2O.l-1.s at 0.4 l/s flow].

  ".W": "After voluntary hyperventilation, normal humans do not develop a significant ventilatory depression despite low arterial CO2 tension, a phenomenon attributed to activation of a brain stem mechanism referred to as the \"afterdischarge.\" Afterdischarge is one of the factors that promote ventilatory stability. It is not known whether physiological stimuli, such as hypoxia, are able to activate the afterdischarge in humans. To test this, breath-by-breath ventilation (VI) was measured in nine young adults during and immediately after a brief period (35-51 s) of acute hypoxia (end-tidal O2 tension 55 Torr). Hypoxia was terminated by switching to 100% O2 (end-tidal O2 tension of first posthypoxic breath greater than 100 Torr). Brief hypoxia increased VI and decreased end-tidal CO2 tension. In all subjects, termination of hypoxia was followed by a gradual ventilatory decay; hyperoxic VI remained higher than the normoxic baseline for several breaths and, despite the negative chemical stimulus of hyperoxia and hypocapnia, reached a new steady state without an apparent undershoot. We conclude that brief hypoxia is able to activate the afterdischarge mechanism in conscious humans. This contrasts sharply with the ventilatory undershoot that follows relief of sustained hypoxia, thereby suggesting that sustained hypoxia inactivates the afterdischarge mechanism. The present findings are of relevance to the pathogenesis of periodic breathing in a hypoxic environment. Furthermore, brief exposure to hypoxia might be useful for evaluation of the role of afterdischarge in other disorders associated with unstable breathing.\r"

After a single bout of maximal resisted lengthening of the elbow flexors, elbow position, pain perception, and indicators of cellular damage were measured. Immediately postexercise, a significant decrease in resting muscle length was observed that continued to 48 h. At this time, an increase in perceived muscle soreness was noted (P less than 0.05), and a biopsy of the biceps brachii revealed mast cell degranulation, separations of the extracellular matrix from myofibers, and increased plasma constituents in the extracellular space. It is proposed that myofiber disruption allows intracellular proteins to escape and extracellular proteins and ions to enter, causing swelling, whereas the disrupted extracellular matrix initiates the inflammatory response, which includes the release of mast cell granules seen at 48 h postexercise. Thus the delayed sensation of pain (soreness) after repeated eccentric muscle actions probably results from inflammation in response to extracellular matrix disruption.\r"

Incremental hypoxia reaching 70% arterial O2 saturation was produced in normocapnia [end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) 36.9 +/- 2.6 to 34.9 +/- 3.4 Torr] or hypocapnia (PETCO2 32.8 +/- 0.6 to 23.7 +/- 0.6 Torr) by an 8-min rebreathing technique and regulation of inspired CO2. Normocapnic hypoxia was characterized by progressive reductions in arterial PO2 (PaO2, 89.1 +/- 3.5 to 34.1 +/- 0.1 Torr) with stable PETCO2, arterial PCO2 (PaCO2), and arterial pH and resulted in increases in heart rate (35%) systolic blood pressure (14%), and minute ventilation (5-fold). Hypocapnic hypoxia resulted in progressively decreasing PaO2 (100.2 +/- 3.6 to 28.9 +/- 0.1 Torr), with progressive reduction in PaCO2 (39.0 +/- 1.6 to 27.3 +/- 1.9 Torr), and an increase in arterial pH (7.41 +/- 0.02 to 7.53 +/- 0.03), heart rate (61%), and ventilation (3-fold). In the brain, hypoxia resulted in a steady decline of cerebral oxyhemoglobin content and a decrease in oxidized cytochrome a,a3. Significantly greater loss of oxidized cytochrome a,a3 occurred for a given decrease in oxyhemoglobin during hypocapnic hypoxia relative to normocapnic hypoxia. Total blood volume response during hypoxia also was significantly attenuated by hypocapnia, because the increase in volume was only half that of normocapnic subjects. We conclude that cytochrome a,a3 oxidation level in vivo decreases at mild levels of hypoxia. PaCO is an important determinant of brain oxygenation, because it modulates ventilatory, cardiovascular, and cerebral O2 delivery responses to hypoxia.\r"

He and SF6 were administered either intravenously by a membrane oxygenator and partial arteriovenous bypass [venous loading (VL)] or by washin into lung gas [airway loading (AL)]. The single-breath expirograms obtained during constant-flow expiration after inspiration of test gas-free air displayed distinct and regular cardiogenic oscillations. The relative oscillation amplitude (ROA), calculated as oscillation amplitude divided by mixed expired-inspired partial pressure difference, was in the range of 1-8%. The ROA for both He and SF6 was approximately 4.2 times higher in VL than in AL, which indicated that among lung units that emptied sequentially in the cardiac cycle, the effects of alveolar ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) inequality were more pronounced than those of alveolar ventilation-alveolar volume (VA/VA) inequality. In AL, He and SF6 oscillations were 180 degrees out of phase compared with CO2 and O2 oscillations and with He and SF6 oscillations in VL, which suggests that regions with low VA/VA had high VA/Q and very low Q/VA. The ROA was practically unaffected by breath holding in both AL and VL, which indicates that there was little diffusive or convective (cardiogenic) mixing between the lung units that were responsible for cardiogenic oscillations. The ROA was consistently higher for He than for SF6, and the He-to-SF6 ratio was independent of route of test gas loading, averaging 1.6 in both AL and VL. This result may be explained by laminar Taylor dispersion, whereby oscillations generated in peripheral lung regions are dissipated in inverse proportion to diffusion coefficient during transit through the proximal (larger) airways.\r"

A control group of eight sheep (group A) was mechanically ventilated with 40% oxygen at a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg, a frequency of 15 breaths/min, a peak inspiratory pressure less than 18 cmH2O, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 3-5 cmH2O. During the ensuing 48 h, there were no measurable deleterious changes in lung function or arterial blood gases. Another 19 sheep were ventilated with 40% oxygen at a peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cmH2O under a different set of conditions and were randomly assigned to two groups. In group B, the respiratory rate was kept near 4 breaths/min to keep arterial PCO2 in the normal range; in group C, the frequency was kept near 15 breaths/min by including a variable dead space in the ventilator circuit to keep arterial PCO2 near baseline values. There was a progressive deterioration in total static lung compliance, functional residual capacity, and arterial blood gases. After some hours, there were abnormal chest roentgenographic changes. At time of death we found severe pulmonary atelectasis, increased wet lung weight, and an increase in the minimum surface tension of saline lung lavage fluid.\r"

The 102 patients studied were divided into two groups according to weight changes. A comparison of the actual caloric intakes of these groups was conducted. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that body surface area in square meters and burn surface were significant predictors of caloric requirements to maintain weight in these patients. It was determined that 1800 kcal was a plausible value for the calories per body surface area. Therefore the regression was formed with 1800 kcal as the multiplier of body surface area, and the multiplier of burn surface area was estimated. The resulting formula provides 1300 kcal/m2 burned, which is 900 kcal/m2 burned less than our previously suggested formula.\r"

The susceptibilities of 68 gram-positive burn-wound isolates were tested against topical Bactroban (mupirocin) (Beecham Laboratories, Bristol, Tenn.) and compared with other topical antimicrobials such as mafenide acetate, silver sulfadiazine, and bacitracin/neomycin/polymyxin (BNP). Topical susceptibility data were obtained with a modification of NAWD assay. Bactroban's antimicrobial activity was greater than that of mafenide acetate (100% vs 97%), and significantly greater than that of silver sulfadiazine and that of BNP (p less than 0.001). Of the 68 isolates that were susceptible to Bactroban, 51 were predominately methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA). Bactroban showed in vitro activity against 71% of the 85 gram-negative isolates tested. Mafenide acetate showed activity against 89% of these isolates, a significant difference compared with Bactroban (p less than 0.02). In general, no significant difference was found between the activities of Bactroban and silver sulfadiazine against the gram-negative isolates. The activities of mafenide acetate and silver sulfadiazine against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly greater than that of Bactroban (p less than 0.05). Bactroban may be used in the treatment of documented staphylococcal burn-wound infections. On the basis of the in vitro data, 13 patients with MRSA burn-wound infections susceptible to Bactroban were evaluated. Quantitative wound biopsies were employed to determine the efficacy of this therapeutic approach. The outcome of these infections was correctly predicted by the NAWD assay in 92.3% of the patients treated (p less than 0.0005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Weight increased for 48% of the intubated group versus 17% of the nonintubated group (P less than .01). Aspiration pneumonia occurred more often in the intubated group (58%) than in the nonintubated group (17%) (P less than .01). Decubitus ulcers were also more common in the intubated group (21%) than in the nonintubated group (14%). Restraints were used more in the intubated group (71%) than in the nonintubated group (56%). These differences did not reach statistical significance. All of the intubated patients were severely demented, with MMSE scores of zero. Seventy-one percent of the nonintubated group were demented, with MMSE scores of less than 23. Prolongation of the terminal phase of dementia in the aged by tube feeding is now feasible. The implications of this change in the life-span of demented nursing home patients need attention by families, nursing homes, and those who make public health policy.\r"

  ".W": "Cell-mediated immunity to Listeria monocytogenes (LM) involves both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. An important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of infection and development of protective immunity to LM is secretion of the sulfhydryl-activated hemolysin (Hly), listeriolysin. Listeria secretion of Hly allows LM to escape the endosomal compartment and enter the cytosol of the cell where intracellular growth can occur. We developed a system using bone marrow macrophages cultured in CSF-1 or IFN-gamma for comparing the response of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells to heat-killed, live Hly-, and live Hly+ LM. Macrophages grown in CSF were permissive for intracellular growth of Hly+ but not Hly- LM. CD8+ T cells recognized Hly+ LM but not HK or Hly- LM pulsed macrophages. However, CD4+ T cells recognized all three Listeria preparations fed to IFN-gamma-treated macrophages. These results suggest that both heat-killed LM and live LM efficiently enter the exogenous pathway for class II Ag processing and presentation. In contrast, only Hly+ LM activates the class I pathway, probably as a result of Hly+ bacterial replication within the cytosolic compartment.\r"

  ".W": "Avian homologues of mammalian gamma delta and alpha beta TCR, termed TCR1 and TCR2, have been identified in the chicken with specific mAb. A third TCR, dubbed TCR3, has been identified on a subpopulation of T cells that lack the TCR1 or TCR2 epitopes. We have now produced a mAb that identifies this TCR3 molecule. The anti-TCR3 antibody immunoprecipitates a CD3-associated heterodimer with a relative Mr of 88,000, composed of 48,000 and 40,000 disulfide-linked chains. The Mr 40,000 chains of TCR3 and TCR2 exhibited the same isoelectric points of 5.6 to 6.5 and had core proteins of 34,000. Although the Mr 48,000 chain of TCR3 and the Mr 50,000 chain of TCR2 had the same basic isoelectric point of 6.2 to 7.6, their core proteins were different in size, 31,000 vs 29,000. Immunofluorescence analysis reveals that the TCR3 was present on all of the CD3+ T cells not identified by antibodies specific for TCR1 or TCR2. Thymocytes that expressed the surface CD3/TCR3 complex at relatively low levels were predominantly CD4+ and CD8+, whereas those with higher levels of surface CD3/TCR3 were predominantly CD4+ and CD8+ singles. Mature TCR3+ cells in the periphery were also either CD4+ (80%) or CD8+ (20%). The TCR1+, TCR2+, and TCR3+ subsets of T cells were generated sequentially in the thymus and seeded to the periphery in the same order. Intrathymic development of the TCR3+ cells was selectively inhibited by embryonic treatment with the anti-TCR3 mAb. The pattern of histologic localization of TCR3+ cells in the periphery was similar to the TCR2 subset of cells except that the TCR3+ cells were rarely seen in the intestine. Cross-reactivity patterns of the anti-chicken TCR antibodies suggested that other gallinaceous species share the three types of TCR. We conclude that TCR2 and TCR3 in gallinaceous birds may represent alpha beta subfamilies of TCR that are sequentially expressed on developmentally discrete sublines of T cells.\r"

Similar results were obtained with human T cell clones and T hybridomas derived from such clones either by rosetting assays or by staining with biotinylated-IgD. In agreement with studies of murine IgD-R+ cells, human IgD-R can be up-regulated by exposure of peripheral blood T cells, T cell clones, and hybridomas derived from such clones, to oligomeric IgD, but not monomeric IgD. Human IgD-R can also be induced by IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. In contrast with studies of murine IgD-R, which are expressed primarily by CD4+ cells, phenotyping studies show that both the CD4+ and CD8+ human T cell subsets are capable of expressing IgD-R.\r"

The lymphokine in both culture supernatants and EGTA extracts failed to bind to OVA-Sepharose. Association of GIF with the plasma membrane was confirmed by surface labeling of the 231F1 cells with 125I. The major species of GIF in the extract was 14.4-kDa peptide as determined by SDS-PAGE, and was identical to that detected in culture supernatants. Pretreatment of the cells with monoclonal anti-GIF switched the cells from the formation of unglycosylated IgE-BF to the formation of glycosylated IgE-BF, indicating that the membrane-associated GIF is involved in the determination of the nature of IgE-binding factor during their biosynthesis. When the hybridoma was stimulated with OVA-pulsed APC, EGTA extracts of the cells contained GIF having affinity for OVA. The binding of the OVA-binding GIF in the EGTA extracts to OVA-Sepharose was inhibited by a synthetic peptide, which corresponds to amino acid residues 307-317 in the OVA molecule and represents the epitope recognized by TCR on the cells. The OVA-binding GIF in the extracts bound to the monoclonal anti-TCR-alpha chain, H-28-710 and the mAb 14-12, which is specific for the Ag-binding chain of effector type suppressor factor, and suppressed the in vivo antibody response of BDF1 mice to DNP-OVA in a carrier-specific manner. Evidence was obtained that indicated that the Ag-binding chain was associated with nonspecific GIF chain on the cell surface of the Ag-stimulated cells.\r"

Mice with B53 or SE1.3 hybridomas initially developed high concentrations of IgE and CD8+ Fc epsilon R+ T lymphocytes, followed by a progressive decline in both serum IgE and expression of cytoplasmic epsilon-chains in the hybridoma cells. Serum IgE concentrations in mice with A3B1 hybridomas progressively increased without development of Fc epsilon R+ T lymphocytes nor a subsequent decline in IgE or change in cytoplasmic epsilon-chain expression in the A3B1 cells. An in vitro system in which the IgE-secreting hybridoma cells were cocultured with spleen cells harvested from mice with established B53 tumors was used to investigate the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of IgE production by the hybridoma cells. The results of these studies indicate that: 1) the induction/upregulation of Fc epsilon R on CD8+ T lymphocytes in vivo requires factors in addition to high serum IgE concentrations; 2) in addition to CD8+ Fc epsilon R+ T lymphocytes and monocytes, another, as yet unidentified, splenic cell component appears to contribute to the process by which epsilon-chain expression in IgE-secreting hybridoma cells is suppressed, and 3) a hybridoma (A3B1) that fails to induce CD8+, Fc epsilon R+ T lymphocytes in vivo and is not inhibited in IgE expression in vivo, nonetheless is inhibited in IgE expression in vitro when cocultured with spleen cells from mice with B53 tumors.\r"

  ".W": "mAb to monomorphic determinants of HLA class II Ag have been shown to inhibit monocyte-dependent OKT3-induced T cell proliferation, indicating that MHC class II molecules play a regulatory role also in Ag nonrestricted, CD3-induced T cell proliferation. This effect involves several steps in the process of T cell activation and proliferation, including IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-2 secretion and IL-2R alpha expression. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of an anti-HLA class II mAb (Q5/6) on the mRNA expression of genes related to monocyte and T cell activation. mRNA levels for early (early c-myc, c-fos) and late (late c-myc, N-ras, c-myb) genes involved in T cell activation were determined as well as mRNA levels for IL-1 beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-2R alpha. The kinetics of mRNA induction for ICAM-1 was also investigated. The results show that in T lymphocytes the expression of c-fos and early c-myc mRNA was unaffected by mAb Q5/6, whereas the c-myb and N-ras mRNA levels were strongly diminished as well as those of IL-2, IL-2R alpha, and IFN-gamma mRNA. An early increase of ICAM-1 mRNA was partially inhibited. In monocytes, a marked reduction of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA was found. It is concluded that the HLA class II determinant involved in the inhibition mechanism can be engaged in the control of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA levels and constitute an accessory signal up-regulating IL-2 and IL-2R alpha gene activation, through a pathway not affecting c-myc and c-fos expression.\r"

  ".W": "To define cell populations which participate in the very early stages of T cell development in the mouse thymus, we enriched hematopoietic stem cells from mouse bone marrow and injected them into thymic lobes of irradiated Ly-5 congenic recipients. The progeny of the stem cells were identified and their phenotypes were determined by two-color flow cytometry for the expression of various cell surface differentiation Ag during the course of their subsequent intrathymic development. The majority of the differentiation which occurred in the first 10 days after intrathymic cell transfer was myeloid in nature; hence, this study demonstrates that the irradiated thymus is not strictly selective for T cell development. Further, the maximum rate of T cell development was observed after intrathymic injection of 200 stem cells. Donor-derived cells which did not express Ag characteristic of the myeloid lineage could be detected and their phenotypes could be determined by flow cytometry as early as 7 days after intrathymic injection. At this time, the cells were still very similar phenotypically to the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells. Exceptions to this were the expression of stem cell Ag 2 and a decrease in the level of MHC class I Ag expression. After 9 days, the donor-derived cells expressed high levels of the Thy-1 Ag and proceeded to change in cell surface phenotype as differentiation continued. These cell phenotypes are described for the time frame ending 18 days after injection, when most donor-derived cells were phenotypically small CD4+ CD8+ (double-positive) thymocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Adhesion of lymphocytes to high endothelial venule (HEV) cells is the first step in the migration of these cells from blood into lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (PP). In the present study, we isolated and cultured HEV cells from PP of the rat and assessed their capacity to interact with lymphocytes. Flow cytometric analysis with a rat HEV-specific mAb KJ-4 revealed that greater than 90% of the cultured cells were stained by the antibody. Furthermore, confluent monolayers of PP HEV cells retained the capacity to support the adhesion of lymphocytes from spleen, thoracic duct, and lymph nodes but not binding of immature cells from thymus and bone marrow, which are deficient in cells capable of binding to HEV in vivo. In addition, intraepithelial lymphocytes that preferentially migrated into mucosal lymphoid tissues were also enriched in cells that adhered to the endothelial monolayers. The binding process required energy, was calcium-dependent, and could be inhibited by cytochalasin D, trypsin, and mixed glycosidase. Interestingly, pretreatment of PP HEV cells with rTNF, IFN-gamma, or granulocyte-macrophage CSF significantly increased the endothelial adhesiveness for thoracic duct lymphocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In contrast, stimulation of lymphocytes with phorbol ester or TNF resulted in the rapid modulation of the surface expression of the PP homing receptor and decrease in lymphocyte binding to normal or TNF-stimulated HEV cells. The adhesion of lymphocytes to normal or cytokine-stimulated HEV cells can be blocked by pretreatment of lymphocytes, but not HEV cells, with the PP homing receptor-specific 1B.2.6 antibody. Taken together, these experiments provide strong evidence that the interaction between lymphocytes and cultured HEV cells are mediated by adhesive mechanisms that regulate lymphocyte entry into PP in vivo and that cytokines can promote HEV adhesiveness for lymphocytes through increased expression of organ-specific ligands on HEV cells.\r"

Enrichment of urushiol specific T cells was detected in lesional skin or blister fluid of five of five of these donors as well as seven of seven donors with urushiol patch tests. There was also enrichment relative to tetanus toxoid specific T cells in blood and skin of six of seven donors. The frequency of lesional T cells specific for urushiol was less than 1/100 and generally less than 1/1000. Furthermore, the frequency of urushiol specific T cells was often less than 1/10,000 in the peripheral blood during an acute eruption. Autoreactive T cells that proliferated to autologous irradiated PBMC were also enriched in skin lesions relative to blood in 5/5 urushiol patch tests. These autoreactive T cells were expanded and found to be CD4+. It has been proposed that such autoreactive T cells recognize autologous DR and may have a role in immunoregulation. Urushiol-specific T cells were expanded from limiting dilution wells of two donors and characterized. The majority of the urushiol-specific cells were CD8+, and 13/43 lines were suppressive for PWM-induced IgG synthesis.\r"

The addition of purified monocytes strongly enhanced the production of IFN-gamma in IL-2-stimulated T cell cultures but did not influence the production of TNF or the level of T cell proliferation. The addition of IL-1 to T cells activated by PHA and optimal concentrations of IL-2 resulted in a strong induction of IFN-gamma production but had no influence on TNF production or T cell proliferation. IL-6 did not influence IFN-gamma or TNF production or T cell proliferation induced by PHA-IL-2 and did not modulate IL-1-induced IFN-gamma production. The production of IFN-gamma by CD4+ 45R+ Th cells was strongly enhanced by IL-1, whereas CD8+ T cells were less responsive to IL-1 and CD4+ 45R+ T cells were unresponsive to IL-1. We demonstrate, at the clonal level, that the optimal production of IFN-gamma by human Th cells requires both IL-1 and IL-2, whereas the production of TNF and T cell proliferation are induced by IL-2 alone. We suggest that IL-1 acts as a second signal for IFN-gamma production and that it may have an important function in regulating the pattern of lymphokines produced by T cell subsets during activation.\r"

  ".U": "91060962\r", 
  ".W": "Our studies show that the presence of IL-4 during the response of naive Th cells causes precursors to develop into a population comprised largely of \"Th2-like\" effectors that secrete IL-4 and IL-5, but little IL-2 or IFN-gamma. We find that the levels of IL-4 and IL-2 determine both the level of effectors developed in response to mitogen or Ag and the patterns of lymphokines they secrete when restimulated. IL-2 is required for optimum generation of effectors, and increasing levels of IL-2, augments the expansion of effectors secreting both IL-4/IL-5 and IFN-gamma. In contrast, IL-4 is required for the development of IL-4/IL-5 secreting effectors but suppresses the development of IL-2 and at higher doses IFN-gamma-secreting effectors detected after 4 days. Also dramatic are the effects of the presence or absence of IL-4 evaluated after an additional 1 to 2 wk. When cultures with or without initial IL-4 are cultured in IL-2 alone from days 4 to 11, they retain their distinct patterns of lymphokine production. Those cells that developed in cultures without IL-4 progressively secrete more IL-2 and can be maintained and expanded in IL-2. They continue to produce IFN-gamma, though the levels decrease somewhat with time, but they do not acquire the ability to produce IL-4 or IL-5. These cells thus increasingly resemble Th1 cell lines. In contrast, those cells in cultures initially exposed to IL-4, generate effectors which secrete high levels of IL-4/IL-5 (plus variable levels of IFN-gamma) at days 4 to 5, but the populations of cells developed, are not maintained well on IL-2 alone. Those cells that do survive continue to secrete IL-4 and IL-5 but not IL-2. In addition, IFN-gamma production, if present, falls off with time. Thus the cells in these cultures take on an increasingly Th2-like phenotype. It appears that the effects of low levels of IL-4 in suppressing IL-2 production by day 4 effectors appear to be transient whereas the higher levels appear to drive the development along a distinct pathway which is irreversible. These studies support the concept that different subsets of helper cells, which correspond roughly to Th1 and Th2 subsets, can develop rapidly in short term culture with respectively low vs high levels of IL-4. They support the concept that such distinct phenotypes arise from alternate pathways of differentiation that can be expected to reflect pathways available for helper T cell differentiation in the animal.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of anaphylactic immune responses in protective immunity against schistosomiasis, mice vaccinated with irradiated cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni were treated with neutralizing mAb antibodies against either IL-5 or IL-4 before and during challenge infection. Anti-IL-5-treated vaccinated mice showed a complete ablation of circulating as well as tissue eosinophils present in inflammatory reactions to migrating schistosomula in the skin and lungs but nevertheless eliminated challenge infections as effectively as vaccinated animals treated with a control mAb. Similarly, treatment of vaccinated mice with an anti-IL-4 mAb markedly reduced serum IgE although failing to diminish immunity. The effect of anti-IL-5 mediated eosinophil depletion was also assessed in a second model in which resistance is induced by concomitant chronic infection. Again, normal, unaltered protection was observed in the absence of circulating and tissue eosinophils. In contrast to the above findings, treatment with anti-IFN-gamma was found to cause a partial depletion of immunity in vaccinated mice whereas, paradoxically, increasing the numbers of inflammatory reactions against invading schistosomula in the lungs. These observations argue against a requirement for either eosinophils or IgE in the anti-schistosome immunity induced by vaccination with irradiated cercariae or for eosinophils in the resistance resulting from previous infection in mice and support previous data suggesting a role for an IFN-gamma dependent cell-mediated effector mechanism in vaccine-induced resistance.\r"

Follow-up throat culture specimens were obtained 4 days, 2 months, and 4 months after the completion of antibiotic therapy, as well as during any interim episodes of acute pharyngitis. Serotyping of all GABHS isolates was performed to distinguish between recurrences with homologous serotypes and new acquisitions with heterologous serotypes. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in age, gender, duration of illness before enrollment in the study, initial clinical presentation, or compliance. Of the 50 patients in the immediate-treatment group, 6 (12%) had homologous serotypes of GABHS isolated on one of the follow-up throat cultures. Of the 63 patients in the delayed-treatment group, 9 (14%) had homologous serotypes of GABHS isolated on one of the follow-up throat cultures. These data indicate that a 48-hour delay in the initiation of penicillin therapy for GABHS pharyngitis does not reduce the recurrence rate.\r"

We compared 10-day courses of orally administered phenoxymethyl penicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, using a randomized, single-blind treatment protocol. Eligible patients were 2 to 16 years of age and had culture-proven acute GABHS pharyngitis; 89 patients (43 penicillin, 46 amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) were compliant with therapy. beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were isolated before therapy from the throats of 67% of patients treated with penicillin and 63% treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Throat cultures after completion of therapy were positive for GABHS in 7 (7.9%) of 89 patients. The initial GABHS T type persisted (treatment failure) in only 4 (4.5%) of 89 patients, including 3 (6.5%) of 46 who received amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and in 1 (2.3%) of 43 who received penicillin (not statistically significant). Bacteriologic treatment failure was unrelated to recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria at the time of enrollment or after treatment. We conclude that beta-lactamase production by normal pharyngeal flora does not fully explain the failure of penicillin therapy for acute streptococcal pharyngitis. Using an antibiotic effective against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria will not eliminate the problem of bacteriologic treatment failure.\r"

Three groups of hearts were perfused from an adult support pig, with pH varied by a carbon dioxide/oxygen gas exchanger and temperature controlled by a heat exchanger. After control function studies were obtained at normothermia with a pH of 7.4, the hearts were cooled over 15 minutes to 10 degrees C. Hypothermic perfusion was maintained for 1 hour, followed by rewarming to 37 degrees C. In group 1 (n = 5), the alpha stat (neutral) model, the blood perfusate was maintained at a pH of 7.4 (calculated at 37 degrees C). In group 2, the alkaline model, the pH was maintained at 7.9, and in group 3, the pH-stat (acid) model, the pH was maintained at 7.0. In addition, the effect of 1 hour of hypothermic ischemia after hypothermic perfusion at a pH of 7.0 was evaluated in five hearts (group 4). After rewarming no significant difference was noted in functional recovery (group 1 = 93% +/- 5%, group 2 = 92% +/- 6%, group 3 = 96% +/- 5%, and group 4 = 95% +/- 2%), oxygen consumption, coronary resistance, lactate extraction, and myocardial extravascular water content. We conclude that neonatal heart function is resistant within the range of this study to changes in pH caused by changes in carbon dioxide tension during hypothermic perfusion and ischemia.\r"

Gonococcal resistance is widespread, and few communities will be spared all types. None of the newer diagnostic technologies has provided any performance or cost advantages over traditional Gram-stained smears and cultures. The two most important components of a control program are (1) the National Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance project and (2) treatment with ceftriaxone, 125 or 250 mg intramuscularly, which is active against all known types of resistance and will cure all forms of uncomplicated gonorrhea, including the more difficult-to-treat infections of the pharynx and anorectum. Fear of AIDS has had a powerful motivating effect on sexual behavior, and in the United States has been associated with an overall reduction in incidence of gonorrhea in homosexual men of over 95%. After peaking in 1985, incidence of gonorrhea in white heterosexual men and women has declined as well. A diagnosis of gonorrhea in 1990 implies recent high-risk behavior for acquiring HIV infection. The gonorrhea epidemic in the United States is rapidly contracting down around poor urban minorities; although this is not good, at least it tells us where to target our resources.\r"

The epitope was not encoded by reported sequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) but instead was coded for by a host cellular sequence. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for antibodies to the GOR epitope (anti-GOR). A patient with acute NANBH produced both IgM and IgG classes of anti-GOR in the acute phase of the illness, with concentrations of IgG class anti-GOR rising when anti-HCV became detectable. Anti-GOR was detected in serum from 59 (81%) of 73 patients with chronic NANBH, 40 (65%) of 62 with NANB liver cirrhosis, and 25 (63%) of 40 NANB patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, but in only less than 10% of patients with chronic liver diseases due to hepatitis B virus, alcohol, or an autoimmune disorder, and in only 2% of voluntary blood donors. Circulating HCV-RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in most patients seropositive for anti-GOR but negative for anti-HCV. Detection of anti-GOR would therefore help in the diagnosis of NANBH and in reducing the occurrence of post-transfusion hepatitis.\r"

The mean proliferative responses to AP-Mt were higher in synovial-fluid than in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in rheumatoid arthritis patients (mean [SEM] stimulation index 10.5 [3.1] vs 2.6 [0.9]) and in pleural-exudate than in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in the pleuritic patients (7.5 [1.7] vs 3.5 [2.0]). The same pattern was seen for the other three antigens. Only 1 of 26 synovial-fluid mononuclear cell samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients showed a positive response (stimulation index 3 or more) to 65 kD compared with 5 of 22 pleural-exudate mononuclear cell samples, so 65 kD seems not to be the major antigen recognised by synovial-fluid T cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Enhanced reactivity against mycobacterial and other bacterial antigens is not restricted to mononuclear cells from chronically inflamed joints but seems to be a common feature of chronic inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Current treatment of hemophilia A, a hereditary disorder affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 males, relies on plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates. We tested the safety and efficacy of a recombinant factor VIII preparation for the treatment of this disorder. METHODS. We conducted the investigation in three stages: comparing the pharmacokinetics of plasma-derived and recombinant factor VIII, assessing the efficacy of recombinant factor VIII for home therapy, and assessing its efficacy for major surgical procedures and hemorrhage. A total of 107 subjects with hemophilia, 20 of whom had not been treated previously, enrolled in the investigation. RESULTS. The in vivo recovery and elimination half-lives of recombinant factor VIII equaled or exceeded those of plasma-derived factor VIII. Seventy-six subjects participated in a home-treatment program, using recombinant factor VIII for 69 to 807 days (median, 618); home diaries of 56 subjects treated for 5 months were analyzed. Of 540 bleeding episodes, 399 (73.9 percent) required only one treatment with recombinant factor VIII. The projected annual consumption of recombinant factor VIII was similar to that of plasma-derived factor VIII concentrate. Twenty-six subjects received recombinant factor VIII for 22 surgical procedures and 10 serious hemorrhages; hemostasis was excellent in all cases. De novo formation of inhibitors occurred in only 1 of 85 previously treated subjects. Inhibitor antibodies also developed in 6 of 21 children, 20 of whom had not previously been treated; 5 had low levels (less than or equal to 7.5 Bethesda units) despite continued treatment with recombinant factor VIII. There was no evidence of new formation of antibody to foreign proteins, and recombinant factor VIII was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS. Recombinant factor VIII has biologic activity comparable to that of plasma factor VIII and is safe and efficacious for the treatment of hemophilia A.\r"

  ".W": "The generation of force during muscle contraction results from the interaction of myosin and actin. The kinetics of this force generation vary between different muscle types and within the same muscle type in different species. Most attention has focused on the role of myosin isoforms in determining these differences. The role of actin isoforms has received little attention, largely because of the lack of a suitable cell type in which the myosin isoform remains constant yet the actin isoforms vary. An alternative approach would be to examine the effect of actin mutations, however, most of these cause such gross disruption of muscle structure that mechanical measurements are impossible. We have now identified two actin mutations which, despite involving conserved amino acids, can assemble into virtually normal myofibrils. These amino-acid changes in actin significantly affect the kinetics of force generation by muscle fibres. One of the mutations is not in the putative myosin-binding site, demonstrating the importance of long-range effects of amino acids on actin function.\r"

Recessive let-60 mutations that cause a vulvaless phenotype prevent let-60 function in response to the inductive signal. These mutations are clustered and define regions necessary either for the activation or for the action of the let-60 ras protein. Dominant let-60 mutations that cause a multivulva phenotype alter codon 13 and activate let-60 in vivo, rendering it independent of the inductive signal. The let-60 gene acts within an extensively defined genetic pathway, and other genes within this pathway seem likely to encode molecules that regulate let-60 function as well as molecules that are targets of let-60 action.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium channel activity is crucial for secretion and synaptic transmission, but it has been difficult to study Ca2+ channel modulation because survival and regulation of some of these channels require cytoplasmic constituents that are lost with the formation of cell-free patches. Here we report a new patch clamp configuration in which activity and regulation of channels are maintained after removal from cells. A pipette containing the pore-forming agent nystatin is sealed onto a cell and withdrawn to form an enclosed vesicle. The resulting perforated vesicle, formed from pituitary tumour cells, contains Ca2+ and K+ channels. Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels in the vesicle are activated by cyclic AMP analogues, and by a neuropeptide (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) that stimulates phosphatidylinositol turnover and inositol trisphosphate-gated Ca2+ release from intracellular organelles. Thus, the perforated vesicle retains signal transduction systems necessary for ion channel modulation. Functional dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels (L-type) are maintained in the vesicle, and their gating is inhibited by thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Hence, this new patch clamp configuration has allowed a direct detection of the single-channel basis of transmitter-induced inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels. The modulation of Ca2(+)-channel gating may be an important mechanism for regulating hormone secretion from pituitary cells.\r"

There probably are 3.2 million people with neurologic disorders among the 34 million uninsured, and more among the underinsured. Those patients probably have difficulty obtaining health care, including neurologic consultations, laboratory tests, and radiologic procedures. Congress and many state legislatures are considering various proposals to address the problems of the un- and underinsured. Several national medical professional societies have developed programs to improve access to care for their patients. The American Academy of Neurology Task Force on Access to Health Care is studying access to care for neurologic patients and will recommend a course of action to the Academy. The Task Force welcomes suggestions concerning appropriate steps to improve access to health care for patients with neurologic disorders.\r"

The sciatic nerves of adult rats were sutured into silicone chambers 20 mm in length, creating an 18-mm gap between the proximal and distal nerve stumps. The chambers were filled with either a mixture of fibronectin and laminin (500 micrograms/ml each) or a solution of cytochrome C (1 mg/ml) as the control. After six weeks, the animals were killed and the chambers were examined for regeneration. Seventy percent of the animals from the FN-LAM group demonstrated regeneration across the 18-mm gaps, compared to only 30% in the control group. The combination of FN-LAM significantly increased the number of axons that grew into the distal end of the chamber (FN-LAM, 1325 +/- 522; cytochrome C, 153 +/- 104; p = 0.03). Examination of the distal tributaries of the sciatic nerve revealed axons only in the FN-LAM group; none were found in the control group. Quantitative analysis of neurons, retrogradely labeled with horseradish peroxidase via injection of the sciatic nerve distal to the regenerated segment, revealed a greater number of sensory and motor neurons in the FN-LAM group compared to the control group. Morphometric studies revealed that the mean area of the regenerated segment in the FN-LAM group was 37% larger than the controls, and ultrastructural analysis demonstrated a more mature regenerated nerve. This is the first in vivo demonstration that this combination of fibronectin and laminin significantly enhances the regeneration of myelinated axons across a long nerve gap in the rat sciatic nerve.\r"

This method allowed the detection of cellular mRNA in tissue sections from the temporal bone or brainstem after cRNA/mRNA hybridization. To produce specific cRNA, single-stranded 35S-labeled cRNA (complimentary to target mRNA) is transcribed from commercially available plasmid vectors. These vectors contain promotor sequences for specific synthesis of RNA, and polylinker regions that will accept cloned DNA inserts for virtually any target nucleic acid sequence of interest. The protocol used in this research was optimized for studies that included concomitant immunohistochemical evaluation. The combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry provides the only method to correlate molecular information (gene expression) with biochemical or molecular markers, such as peptides or proteins (mRNA translation products) on individual cells in the temporal bone or brainstem. Using these techniques, we examined the distribution of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide in rat temporal bone and brainstem sections using calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antisera and CGRP cRNA probes. We used in situ hybridization histochemistry with a cRNA probe complementary to the 3'-end noncoding sequence of the alpha CGRP mRNA and immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal antibody to the (TYR)CGRP23-37 to study the distribution of CGRP mRNA and CGRP-like immunoreactivity in the central and peripheral facial nerve. Numerous motoneuron cell bodies in the facial nucleus and accessory seventh nucleus and cell bodies in the gustatory geniculate ganglion were found to contain CGRP mRNA and the CGRP peptide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the basis of other studies that showed interleukin 1 can stimulate fibroblasts and macrophages to produce collagenases and prostaglandins, we then proposed that interleukin 1 may play an important role in cholesteatoma-related bone resorption, also. Our immunocytochemical study involving more human cholesteatoma samples revealed the presence of interleukin 1 in bone cells and monocytes in the region of active bone destruction. In the present study, the effect of interleukin 1 on these cells found at the bone resorption site was examined. By radioimmunoassay, interleukin 1 was shown to stimulate the production of prostaglandin E2 by osteoblasts in vitro. Interleukin 1 also promoted the migration and multinucleation of bone marrow-derived monocytes. These osteoclast-like cells formed from monocytes contained tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and caused the resorption of the devitalized bone in vitro. Above findings suggest that interleukin 1 could cause the bone destruction in cholesteatomas, not only by stimulating the local bone cells, but also by recruiting monocytes for osteoclastic bone resorption.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in the presence of interleukin-2 results in the generation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells that are highly cytotoxic to a variety of autologous and allogenic tumor targets. We have identified a noncytotoxic, soluble factor, produced by human squamous cell cancers of the head and neck, that profoundly inhibits the generation of LAK cytotoxicity. Inhibition of the generation of cytotoxicity was demonstrated with coculture of PBL and freshly disaggregated tumor cells in a Transwell two-chamber system. Alternatively, inhibition occurred when LAK cells were generated in the presence of tumor-conditioned supernatants alone. These effects were not observed with conditioned supernatants from autologous or allogenic lymphocytes, human fibroblasts, or the erythroleukemia cell line K562. The presence of this inhibitory factor(s) was not required during the entire period of LAK generation. Suppression of cytotoxicity, measured after 4 days of LAK generation, could also be demonstrated when the conditioned tumor supernatant was present in only the last 24 hours of incubation. Suppression is mediated by a heat-labile factor with a molecular weight of greater than 75 kd. These results suggest that LAK cytotoxicity may be significantly impaired by soluble immunoregulatory factors present within the tumor milieu of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Further characterization of these factors may lead to the development of more rational and effective forms of immunotherapy.\r"

Four pigs then had the balloon bronchoscopically removed, while four controls underwent sham removal of the balloon. All animals showed significant atelectasis of the obstructed lobe compared to non-obstructed lobes at 24 hours. Pulmonary blood flow decreased significantly 24 hours after obstruction compared to pre-obstruction values in the collapsed lobe in all animals. Re-expansion was followed by arterial hypoxemia, which was accompanied by an increase in relative blood flow to the partially re-expanded lobe in the experimental group. No significant changes in lung water content occurred in the study group compared to controls.\r"

The 0.05% concentration showed no significant change in ciliary activity compared to control measurements. These data demonstrate that phenylephrine has a ciliostimulatory effect in vivo, as well as in appropriate concentrations in vitro, and should be safe and relatively nontoxic to the mucociliary apparatus for short-term use.\r"

Microscopic examination of whole-mounted tissue revealed many immunoreactive fibers on the spiral modiolar artery. TH-positive fibers have also been found on both radiating arterioles and radial collecting venules, which has not been previously reported.

Electrodes in direct contact with the auditory nerve should be functional at lower thresholds and might require fewer remaining neurons for stimulation compared to electrodes in the scala tympani. This strategy would also provide close contact with neural elements subserving a greater frequency range. Implantation of the eighth nerve may also be advantageous in profoundly deaf subjects who lack an implantable scala tympani. In this study we evaluated the effect of surgical implantation and chronic placement of a silicon substrate implant in the modiolar portion of the auditory nerve of the guinea pig. Of six chronically implanted ears, five showed changes limited to the loss of spiral ganglion cells in the canal of Rosenthal, immediately adjacent to the implant. The sixth ear showed more extensive cochlear alteration in a pattern suggestive of vascular injury. In separate acute experiments, implants were placed in the modiolar portion of the auditory nerve and electrophysiologic analysis was performed. Middle latency responses with good morphology were obtained at thresholds below those found with scala tympani implants. Input-output functions exhibited a plateau in response amplitude at stimulus levels below thresholds for seventh or vestibular portion of the eighth nerve. Further modifications of the modiolar portion of the auditory nerve electrode design will include development of an electrode interconnect that will allow chronic implantation with stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular disorders have often been proposed to explain disorders of the inner ear, in both the cochlear and vestibular systems. While the cochlea has been extensively studied, little work has been done on vestibular blood flow. Existing studies have reported only total vestibular blood flow, using microspheres. By combining the physiologic technique of microsphere injection with new developments in morphologic stereology studies, data on end-organ blood flow (excluding nerve; 0.074 +/- 0.027 microliters/min; 5.99 microliters/min/mm3), capillary surface area (10.87 mm2/mm3), mean capillary diameter (9.64 microns), and end-organ volume (0.013 mm3) was determined for the posterior canal ampulla of young Fischer 344 rats. Results indicate an anatomic basis for increases in blood flow with CO2 breathing, and provide an assessment of appropriate microsphere size for vestibular blood flow studies. By allowing comparison of blood flow and capillary parameters related to surface area and volume, this new method of blood flow study will allow more meaningful data to be collected on the vestibular system.\r"

  ".W": "The etiology of an asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss can often be difficult to determine. Because a wide variety of pathologic processes may be responsible for the hearing loss, numerous diagnostic tests are usually used in the initial evaluation, including pure-tone audiometry, acoustic reflex testing, imaging, serologic testing, and auditory brainstem response testing. The diagnostic evaluations of 225 consecutive cases of asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss are reviewed. A cochlear site-of-lesion was demonstrated in the majority (194) of patients. Because all retrocochlear lesions (31) were associated with an abnormal auditory brainstem response, imaging should be performed in that group of patients. Magnetic resonance imaging offers greater specificity than computed tomography. Reflex decay, acoustic reflex testing, and rollover were all associated with a high false-negative rate. Whereas serologic testing for syphilis yielded several cases of otosyphilis, thyroid function testing was of little value. A diagnostic protocol for asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss is presented.\r"

At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, we have used such a plan, using external beam conventional therapy in combination with an interstitial boost of iridium 192 to the primary site, plus planned neck dissections in selected patients. Between 1981 and 1986, 17 patients with untreated base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma were treated in this manner. Thirteen of the 17 are disease-free as a result of this therapy. Two patients have failed locally, yielding an actuarial local control of 87% at a median followup of 2 years. These data would suggest that primary radiation that includes interstitial therapy as part of the plan, along with neck dissection in certain situations, is a worthwhile method management of base of tongue carcinoma.\r"

Since typical nasal size and shape vary greatly with ethnic background, different norms for different ethnic groups may be appropriate. Nasal airway flow and resistance and external nasal size and shape were measured in 130 asymptomatic subjects (52 black, 56 white, and 22 Hispanic). Nasal length, width, columellar length, and nasolabial angle were similar for whites and Hispanics, but both groups differed significantly from blacks--even when changes attributable to biologic aging were factored out. In spite of these differences, there was no significant difference in any nasal airflow or resistance parameter among groups, suggesting that currently used airflow and resistance standards are valid for these three different ethnic groups.\r"

Three cases are presented with a previously unreported otologic symptom, that of bilateral hearing loss, which in one case was fluctuant. None of the patients had the common symptoms of unilateral hearing loss and headache. With the advent of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, these cysts may be readily identified, usually with diagnostic imaging alone. Unfortunately there is often a delay in diagnosis because of the vague and fleeting nature of the symptoms. Because no single diagnostic symptom pattern is able to characterize all cases, it is believed computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging or both are indicated in patients with long-standing otologic complaints--even in the absence of unilateral symptoms. Treatment of posterior fossa arachnoid cysts primarily consists of surgical procedures designed to decompress the cyst. In this series, treatment with diuretics alone resulted in improvement of symptoms during several years of followup, with no evidence of enlargement of the cysts.\r"

  ".W": "While previous studies have examined the role of neurons in age-related changes of laryngeal sensory nerve function, investigators have not focused on the significant role of Schwann cells in the aging process. This investigation used an electron microscopic morphometric technique to systematically study Schwann cells of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve of three Wistar rat age groups: young = 3 to 5 months; old = 25 months; very old = 29 to 31 months. In Schwann cells of myelinated axons, a substantial and significant reduction (p = 0.0127) in mitochondrial volume fraction was found between the young and old groups, and also between the young and very old groups (young = 0.0034, old = 0.00175, very old = 0.0019). The volume fraction of compact myelin also showed a trend (p = 0.0683) toward decreasing with age. The volume fractions of cytoplasm, nuclei, and lipofuscin granules showed no significant age-related changes (lipofuscin in myelinating Schwann cells: young = 0.0025, old = 0.0020, very old = 0.0051; lipofuscin in non-myelinating Schwann cells: young = 0.012, old = 0.0061, very old = 0.0051). Our observations on mitochondria lead to two possible conclusions regarding energy availability in aged Schwann cells. One possibility is that aged cells have a decreased energy requirement, which is reflected in the decreased mitochondrial densities in old and very old specimens. The other possibility is the reduced mitochondrial volume fractions are independent of cellular energy requirements and are indicative of some aging or pathologic process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mutations had no significant effect on the spectra or redox potentials but altered drastically the stability of the bond between the methionine-80 sulfur and the heme iron, as judged by four criteria: (i) the alkaline pKa values of the 695-nm band of the ferric form of the mutant proteins decreased by almost 1 pH unit as compared to the wild types; (ii) the acid pKa values increased by 0.5 to 1.2 pH units; (iii) the 695-nm band half-disappeared at temperatures 10-20 degrees C lower in the mutant proteins than in the wild types; and (iv) the 695-nm band of the mutant proteins was susceptible to concentrations of urea that had little influence on their overall structure. The valine-substituted rat cytochrome c had properties intermediate between those of the wild type and the alanine mutant. The destabilized coordinative bond is located in space a long distance from the mutation site. It is suggested that the mutations weaken the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of residue 30 and the imino group of the imidazole of histidine-18, modifying the bonding of the heme iron by that imidazole, which, in turn, through a trans effect, weakens the bond between the heme iron and the other axial ligand, the sulfur of methionine-80. Alternatively, the effect of the mutations may be propagated allosterically along the peptide chain.\r"

Two observations indicate a role for the site in Mu replication: mutants of Mu, able to grow on an Escherichia coli gyrB host that does not allow growth of wild-type Mu, were found to possess single-base changes resulting in more efficient gyrase binding and cleavage at the site. Introduction of a 147-base-pair deletion that eliminated the site from a prophage inhibited the onset of Mu replication for greater than 1 hr after induction.\r"

This operon encodes a presumed RNA-binding regulatory protein that is required for attenuation control of the trp operon. We have shown that the mtr operon consists of two structural genes, mtrA and mtrB, predicted to encode 22-kDa and 8-kDa polypeptides, respectively. MtrB shows homology with RegA, an RNA-binding regulatory protein of bacteriophage T4. The lesions in several mtr mutants were localized to mtrB or the putative mtr promoter. Several mtrB alleles were dominant to mtr+, suggesting that the regulatory factor is a multimeric protein. The in vivo action of the mtrA and mtrB gene products was analyzed in an E. coli strain containing a trpE-lacZ gene fusion under control of the B. subtilis trp promoter/attenuator region. Both MtrA and MtrB were necessary for regulation of beta-galactosidase production.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the ability of membrane immunoglobulin-binding ligands to desensitize several human B-cell surface molecules that normally transduce signals leading to Ca2+ mobilization. Ligation of membrane IgM or IgD leads to heterologous desensitization of the reciprocal receptor in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines and peripheral blood B cells, as evidenced by a failure of cells to mobilize in response to receptor ligation. Under these conditions CD19, CD21, and B-cell gp95 ligation also did not lead to normal Ca2+ mobilization, indicating that these transducers are also desensitized. The desensitization does not reflect receptor modulation from the cell surface or reduced accessibility to ligand and is long lived, lasting greater than 16 hr. Finally, data that indicate that desensitized cells remain responsive to the G protein activating agent AIF4-, as measured by Ca2+ mobilization, suggest that desensitization reflects uncoupling of these receptors from G proteins that are intermediaries in their transduction of signals. We hypothesize that the molecular target of desensitization may be a recently described membrane immunoglobulin-associated and inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated protein complex that may function as a master transducer in B cells, analogous to CD3 in T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to evaluate the susceptibility of mitochondrial membranes enriched with n-3 fatty acids to damage by Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species. Fatty acid content and respiratory function were assessed in renal cortical mitochondria isolated from fish-oil- and beef-tallow-fed rats. Dietary fish oils were readily incorporated into mitochondrial membranes. After exposure to Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species, mitochondria enriched in n-3 fatty acids, and using pyruvate and malate as substrates, had significantly greater changes in state 3 and uncoupled respirations, when compared with mitochondria from rats fed beef tallow. Mitochondrial site 1 (NADH coenzyme Q reductase) activity was reduced to 45 and 85% of control values in fish-oil- and beef-tallow-fed groups, respectively. Exposure to Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species enhance the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids enriched at the sn-2 position of phospholipids from mitochondria of fish-oil-fed rats when compared with similarly treated mitochondria of beef-tallow-fed rats. This release of fatty acids was partially inhibited by dibucaine, the phospholipase A2 inhibitor, which we have previously shown to protect mitochondria against damage associated with Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species. The results indicate that phospholipase A2 is activated in mitochondria exposed to Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species and is responsible, at least in part, for the impairment of respiratory function. Phospholipase A2 activity and mitochondrial damage are enhanced when mitochondrial membranes are enriched with n-3 fatty acids.\r"

By virtue of its affinity for gp120 (the external subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein), the hybrid toxin selectively binds to and kills HIV-1-infected human T cells expressing surface envelope glycoprotein and also inhibits HIV-1 spread in mixed cultures of infected and uninfected cells. We now report that CD4(178)-PE40 and reverse transcriptase inhibitors exert highly synergistic effects against HIV-1 spread in cultured human primary T cells. Furthermore, combination treatment can completely eliminate infectious HIV-1 from cultures of human T-cell lines. This conclusion is based on protection of a susceptible cell population from HIV-induced killing, complete inhibition of virus protein accumulation, and elimination of HIV DNA (as judged by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis). The results highlight the therapeutic potential of treatment regimens involving combination of a virostatic drug that inhibits virus replication plus an agent that selectively kills HIV-infected cells.\r"

The predicted amino acid sequences of ShA2 and ShD2 differ only in the amino terminus, which is located intracellularly according to the present topological model of K+ channels. The differing amino termini have profound effects on the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the K+ channel. Most markedly, the nature of the amino terminus determines whether the K+ channel mediates rapidly inactivating or noninactivating K+ currents. It also affects the 4-aminopyridine, tetraethylammonium, and charybdotoxin sensitivities of the K+ channels. These results suggest that the amino terminus of Shaker proteins affects K+ channel structures on both sides of the membrane.\r"

HSV-1 vectors expressing other genes may prove useful for studying neuronal physiology or performing human gene therapy for neurological diseases, such as Parkinson disease or brain tumors. A HSV-1 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant, ts K, has been used as helper virus; ts mutants revert to wild type. In contrast, HSV-1 deletion mutants essentially cannot revert to wild type; therefore, use of a deletion mutant as helper virus might permit human gene therapy with HSV-1 vectors. We now report an efficient packaging system for HSV-1 vectors using a deletion mutant, D30EBA, as helper virus; virus is grown on the complementing cell line M64A. pHSVlac virus prepared using the deletion mutant packaging system stably expresses beta-galactosidase in cultured rat sympathetic neurons and glia. Both D30EBA and ts K contain a mutation in the IE3 gene of HSV-1 strain 17 and have the same phenotype; therefore, changing the helper virus from ts K to D30EBA does not alter the host range or other properties of the HSV-1 vector system.\r"

  ".W": "smg p21A and -B are small GTP-binding proteins that share putative effector and consensus C-terminal sequences with ras p21 proteins. In the present report, we showed that human platelet smg p21B became labeled when intact platelets were incubated with exogenous [3H]mevalonolactone and when a purified preparation of smg p21B was incubated with bovine brain membranes and S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine. In addition, we demonstrated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry that treatment of smg p21B with Raney nickel released a geranylgeranyl moiety in a molar ratio of about 1:1. In contrast, treatment of smg p21B with NH2OH or KOH yielded no evidence for the presence of a palmitoyl thioester. Extensive digestion of smg p21B with Achromobacter protease I yielded two C-terminal tripeptides that contained serine and cysteine in a molar ratio of 2:1. Both peptides were modified by a thioether-linked geranylgeranyl group. One of the peptides comigrated with a 3H-labeled proteolytic product of methylated smg p21B on reverse-phase HPLC and this peptide appeared at the same retention time as that of the other peptide after being treated with KOH. Since the cDNA-predicted C-terminal sequence of smg p21B contains a unique Ser-Ser-Cys peptide within its C-terminal domain, -Lys-Lys-Ser-Ser-Cys-Gln-Leu-Leu184, these results indicate that smg p21B is posttranslationally modified by geranylgeranylation of Cys-181 and suggest that further modifications cause proteolytic removal of the three predicted C-terminal amino acids followed by partial methylation of the cysteinyl carboxyl group.\r"

  ".U": "91062405\r", 
  ".W": "Ileal brush border membranes contain an endogenous Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase activity that modulates the activity of the apical membrane Na+/H+ exchanger. To further characterize this kinase, synapsin I, a substrate for Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases, was added to preparations of ileal brush border membranes. In the presence of Ca2+/CaM, synapsin I was phosphorylated. Phosphopeptide mapping demonstrated that the addition of Ca2+/CaM to brush border membranes stimulated the phosphorylation of sites in synapsin I specific for Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II. Immunoblots containing brush border and microvillus membrane proteins were probed with an antibody that recognizes the 50-kDa subunit of rat brain Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II. This antibody labeled major and minor species of 50 and 53 kDa, respectively, with more labeling of the brush border than the microvillus membranes. Right-side-out ileal villus cell brush border vesicles were prepared containing CaM, ATP, and 350 nM free Ca2+. Na+/H+ exchange was inhibited by the presence of Ca2+/CaM/ATP within the vesicles. A 21-amino acid peptide inhibitor of CaM kinase II was enclosed within some vesicle preparations by freeze-thaw. The effect on Na+/H+ exchange of Ca2+/CaM/ATP was partially reversed by the inhibitor peptide. These studies demonstrate the presence of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II in rabbit ileal villus cell brush border membranes. Based on the effect of a specific inhibitor peptide of Ca2+/CaM kinase II, it is concluded that this kinase inhibits brush border Na+/H+ exchange, which participates in the regulation of ileal Na+ absorption.\r"

We identified a tandem repeat of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) consensus sequence that binds AP-1-like proteins from nuclear extracts of K562 and HeLa cells. These proteins have the same binding properties as HeLa AP-1 but differ in the electrophoretic mobility and in functional assays. Transient-expression experiments in K562 of various deletion and point mutation constructs derived from hypersensitive site 2 indicate that the enhancer activity and the inducibility of a linked gamma-globin promoter are dependent upon the synergistic action of proteins bound to the tandem AP-1 repeat.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been shown to be relatively resistant to cytolytic attack by other CTLs. We show here, however, that cloned CTLs, in the absence of other cells, are destroyed by exposure to their cognate peptides (defined as those that in association with major histocompatibility complex proteins are recognized by the antigen-specific receptor of the T cell). Destruction is proportional to peptide concentration and can be prevented by a second peptide that competes with the cognate peptide for presentation by the class I major histocompatibility complex proteins of the CTLs. The speed and extent of peptide-induced changes in the appearance of CTLs suggest that the destruction may be due primarily to self-recognition and self-destruction of individual CTLs (suicide) rather than to the destruction of some CTLs by others of the same clone in the same culture (fratricide). This effect may also take place in vivo because the appropriately timed injection of a cognate peptide into ovalbumin-immunized mice appeared to deplete their spleens of primed anti-ovalbumin CTLs. The results point to a possible physiologic mechanism for postthymic elimination of cytolytic T cells that recognize their own peptides in association with their own major histocompatibility complex protein. The results also raise the possibility that cognate peptides might eventually prove therapeutically useful for eliminating CTL clones that cause pathological cell destruction, as in some autoimmune diseases and some viral infections.\r"

Three regions of high H+ concentration (greater than 10 microM) are predicted: one throughout the minor groove of DNA and two localized in the major groove near N7 of guanine and C5 of cytosine for a G.C base pair. These acidic domains correlate well with the observed covalent binding sites of benzo[a]pyrene epoxide (N2 of guanine) and of aflatoxin B1 epoxide (N7 of guanine), chemical carcinogens that presumably undergo acid catalysis to form highly reactive carbocations that ultimately bind to DNA. It is suggested that these regions of high H+ concentration may also be of concern in understanding interactions involving proteins and noncarcinogenic molecules with or near nucleic acids.\r"

Transcript analysis of the region that rescues the olfE phenotype has shown one major transcript at 5.4 kb and a minor one at 1.7 kb. Both of these transcripts are probably alternatively spliced products of the olfE gene.

The rat insulin II promoter was fused to a chicken L-CAM cDNA or to chicken genomic L-CAM sequences. Mice carrying the cDNA showed no expression of L-CAM. Mice carrying L-CAM genomic sequences showed expression in the beta cells of the pancreas, suggesting that sequences in introns or in flanking regions are required for expression. Murine L-CAM was undetectable in the beta cells of the pancreas of those transgenic mice expressing chicken L-CAM and thus appeared to be down-regulated, but expression of the mouse protein was not altered at other sites. Chicken L-CAM was also found in extrapancreatic tissues such as skin, kidney, liver, lung, intestine, blood vessels, and the choroid plexus and leptomeninges of the central nervous system. These findings raised the possibility that the chicken L-CAM gene contains cis regulatory elements that interfere with the specificity of a tissue-specific promoter such as the rat insulin promoter. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice were produced with a construct containing the murine neurofilament promoter fused to genomic chicken L-CAM sequences. Chicken L-CAM was expressed in the brain and spinal cord, where L-CAM is not normally found, but it was also found in some nonneural tissues (kidney, liver, intestine, lung) in which L-CAM is normally expressed. The combined results suggest that tissue-specific cis-acting elements in the chicken L-CAM gene, when combined with heterologous promoters/enhancers, can generate novel patterns of gene expression.\r"

These maxillary and mandibular tumors can be differentiated from the \"brown tumors\" of hyperparathyroidism because they can appear and enlarge even though the hypercalcemia is surgically corrected. These tumors are histologically distinct fibroosseous lesions without the giant cells seen in \"brown tumors.\" The parathyroid enlargement was mostly uniglandular, with multiple tumors found occasionally. Studies in DNA linkage were performed within this large family and a similar family in Houston to determine if the gene for this syndrome, termed HRPT2, is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 11, to which the gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 has been linked. (This linkage is supported by our findings in one family with MEN 1 reported here.) Linkage studies were also performed with markers on chromosome 10, to which the genes for MEN 2A and MEN 2B have been linked. Evidence against close linkage with chromosome 10 and chromosome 11 markers suggests that this clinically distinct syndrome is also genetically distinct.\r"

  ".W": "Methylxanthines are known to be respiratory stimulants and are thought by some to augment hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory drive and improve respiratory muscle strength. Hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses were measured in 10 normal subjects before, during, and after administration of theophylline for three and a half days. Pulmonary function, carbon dioxide production, and mouth pressures during maximal static inspiratory and expiratory efforts were also measured. The mean (SD) serum theophylline concentration was 13.8 (3.2) mg/l. Lung volumes and flow rates did not change significantly with theophylline. The mean (SD) values for maximum static inspiratory pressure were 152 (27), 161 (25), and 160 (24) cm H2O, respectively before, during, and after theophylline. Neither these values nor peak expiratory pressure measurements were significantly changed. The slopes of the hypercapnic ventilatory responses were 2.9 (0.9), 3.3 (1.2), and 3.3 (1.4) l/min/mm Hg carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) respectively before, during, and after theophylline administration. The respective values for the slopes of the hypoxic response were -1.4 (0.9), -1.3 (0.8), and -1.1 (0.9) l/min/1% oxyhaemoglobin saturation. None of these values changed significantly with theophylline. Theophylline, however, increased carbon dioxide production (200 to 236 ml/min) and alveolar ventilation (4.7 to 5.7 l/min) significantly, with a concomitant fall of end tidal PCO2 (35.5 to 32.9 mm Hg). It is concluded that in man oral theophylline at therapeutic blood concentrations increases carbon dioxide production and ventilation without changing pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, or the hypoxic or hypercapnic ventilatory response significantly.\r"

Patients exercised on an angina-limited, supine, multistage bicycle ergometer, and plasma ANP levels and hemodynamic indices were measured at rest, at peak exercise, and 6 minutes after exercise. Plasma ANP levels increased significantly at peak exercise. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) and coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF) were significantly correlated with plasma ANP levels before and at peak exercise (PAWP: r = 0.69, p less than 0.001; CSBF; r = 0.45, p less than 0.05). In six of eight patients whose PAWP exceeded 20 mm Hg at peak exercise, plasma ANP levels were increased at 6 minutes after exercise, whereas PAWP had decreased relative to the values obtained at peak exercise. Plasma ANP concentrations at 6 minutes after exercise were not correlated with PAWP at the same time. However, PAWP at peak exercise was correlated with the plasma ANP levels at 6 minutes after exercise (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001). These results suggest that in patients with effort angina pectoris left ventricular dysfunction resulting from exercise-induced myocardial ischemia may increase preload excessively and may contribute to the excess secretion of ANP after dynamic exercise.\r"

We measured ANP and AVP concentration after transseptal puncture and during percutaneous retrograde mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PRMV) in 11 patients (mean age 57 +/- 12 years; nine women) with mitral stenosis and congestive heart failure. Atrial septal puncture per se resulted in a significant increase in ANP and AVP without a significant change in aortic pressure. Subsequent PRMV led to a further increase in ANP, a transient decrease in aortic pressure from 89 +/- 7 to 45 +/- 4 mm Hg, and a large (fivefold) increase in AVP. ANP and AVP were no longer different from baseline values 18 to 24 after the procedure. This study suggests that transseptal puncture and acute mitral obstruction are major stimuli to ANP release and that combined unloading of arterial and left ventricular mechanoreceptors is a very potent vasopressinergic stimulus.\r"

  ".U": "91063371\r", 
  ".W": "This article reviews the evidence that congestive heart failure is accompanied by an increased plasma norepinephrine concentration and that this is due not only to a reduced tissue clearance of the substance but also to a marked increase in sympathetic nerve activity. It also reports data that indicate that the sympathetic activation is associated with an activation of the renin-angiotensin system and an increased plasma level of vasopressin. At which degree of congestive heart failure these phenomena become manifest is not clear, but some studies suggest that the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems may be normal in asymptomatic congestive heart failure but already somewhat activated when this condition reaches New York Heart Association class II. There is also evidence that this activation, though initially compensatory, is eventually responsible for a number of adverse cardiovascular effects that account for the negative relationship between this event and survival. Finally, the article discusses the inability of the increased plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide that characterizes congestive heart failure to offset the adverse effects of the neurohumoral activation and the variable influence of drug treatment on this phenomenon. This is not impossible to achieve, however, because heart transplantation appears to rapidly normalize a major factor in the increased sympathetic activity observed before surgical intervention, that is, impairment of the arterial baroreflex.\r"

  ".W": "Early diabetes mellitus is characterized by an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow which may initiate and potentiate glomerular injury which ultimately results in diabetic nephropathy. To investigate the role of hyperglycemia per se in mediating these hemodynamic changes, eight healthy adults had inulin clearance, creatinine clearance, and para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance after steady state conditions of hyperglycemia were achieved (549 +/- 86). Clearances were repeated during equivalent osmotic diuresis with Mannitol. Euvolemia was maintained by quantitative fluid and electrolyte replacement of urinary losses. Mean inulin clearances were 87 +/- 6, 87 +/- 5, and 81 +/- 4 ml/min during control, glucose, and mannitol periods (p = ns). Creatinine clearance overestimated inulin clearance by 15-32% but there were no differences between control glucose and mannitol periods. PAH clearance fell from control values of 595 +/- 29 to 340 +/- 22 ml/min during hyperglycemia (p less than .05). During osmotic diuresis with mannitol PAH, clearance rose to control values. In vitro studies excluded the possibility that conjugation between glucose and PAH can explain the clearance results. These results in normal subjects documenting renal vasoconstriction with hyperglycemia are of particular interest in view of recent experimental data suggesting that failure to vasoconstrict characterizes the hemodynamics of early diabetes.\r"

In 15 families one or both parents had either essential hypertension or a strong family history. In 13 families neither parent had essential hypertension or a positive family history. There were significant differences between the children with a positive family history of essential hypertension compared with those without. Values are expressed as mean (SD): intracellular sodium concentration (mmol/l cells) 8.19 (2.18) compared with 6.41 (0.98); sodium efflux rate constant 0.4873 (0.1379) compared with 0.5831 (0.1104); and numbers of sodium-potassium ATPase pump sites (BMax) (nmol/l cells) 7.96 (1.71) compared with 9.56 (1.7). Significant differences were also found when the index hypertensive children were excluded and the normotensive siblings with and without hypertensive family histories were compared. These data suggest that abnormal red cell membrane sodium transport has a familial component, and although it is not caused by the hypertension it may be the earliest pathophysiological step in its development, perhaps allowing the identification of children at risk of essential hypertension.\r"

The mean (SEM) concentration of antidiuretic hormone was significantly raised in patients with bronchiolitis (9.3 (1.4) ng/l) compared with non-pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus infections that cause apnoea or upper respiratory tract symptoms (6.1 (1.7) ng/l). The highest concentrations of antidiuretic hormone were seen in patients receiving mechanical ventilation (18.0 (6.7) ng/l). There were no differences in mean serum sodium concentrations among the subgroups. Hypertranslucency on chest radiograph or an arterial carbon dioxide tension above 6.67 kPa were associated with a significantly higher concentration of antidiuretic hormone. Increased or normal maintenance fluid intake in children with pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus infections may cause the same symptoms of fluid overload as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Patients with pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus infection, hypertranslucency in chest radiograph, hypercapnia, or mechanical ventilation are at risk for raised concentrations of antidiuretic hormone. Restricted fluid intake and careful monitoring of fluid balance and plasma electrolyte concentrations are therefore necessary in these patients.\r"

The combination produced a transient increase in CBF, while CMRO2 did not change. These responses were similar to those produced by i.c. mannitol plus i.v. saline. Suxamethonium produced desynchronization of the EEG that persisted longer than that produced by saline. In only one of the six animals was the desynchronization sustained (90 min) beyond that found in dogs with a normal BBB.

While maintaining PE'CO2 constant at each of three values (means 5.86, 6.45 and 7.2 kPa), PE'O2 was reduced rapidly from more than 25 kPa to 5.3-6 kPa for 3 min to record the increase in ventilation. Eleven sets of these 24 steady state points were obtained (2 PO2 x 3 PCO2 x 4 anaes. = 24). The mean isocapnic hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) was 6.52 (SD 2.58) litre min-1 (n = 33) when awake, 5.62 (3.48) litre min-1 at 0.5% end-tidal halothane (ns), 3.05 (2.02) litre min-1 at 1% and 2.91 (2.12) litre min-1 at 1.25%, the last two being reduced significantly from awake and 0.5% halothane (P less than 0.05). With 1.25% halothane, HVR was reduced to 44.5 (18.6)% of the awake HVR. However, when HVR was expressed as % increase in ventilation produced by isocapnic hypoxia, it was 71 (19)% awake but 124 (65)% with 1.25% halothane, a significant increase with halothane (P less than 0.05). With 1.25% halothane, the carbon dioxide response slope decreased to 36.4 (26.4)% of control; hypoxia did not increase the slope significantly. Whereas previous studies in man have shown that halothane preferentially depresses hypoxic chemosensitivity and has a significant effect at 0.1 MAC, in the goat the hypoxic and carbon dioxide chemosensitivities were depressed equally. At 0.5% end-tidal concentration (about 0.5 MAC), halothane did not significantly depress hypoxic response.\r"

  ".W": "Two childhood cases are reported of peripheral T-cell lymphoma; the neoplastic cells expressed activated CD8 (T8) phenotype and contained Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA. Both patients had an aggressive and rapid clinical course despite chemotherapy. Elevated titers of antibodies to EBV-viral capsid antigen (greater than 640) and early antigen (greater than 10) were found in both patients. Histology revealed pleomorphic immunoblastic lymphoma with extensive necrosis in one case and an angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy-like pattern containing Reed-Sternberg-like giant cells in the other. Southern blot hybridization studies showed clonal rearrangement of the T-cell-receptor beta gene in both cases, and a cytogenetic study on one case revealed clonal structure abnormality involving chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 10, and 19. Analysis of the tumor DNA showed a high copy number of EBV genome per cell compared with that of Raji and Marmoset B 95.8 lines; the study for human T-cell leukemia virus type I was negative. The EBV genome was found by in situ hybridization in the tumor nuclei in both cases. In addition to Burkitt's lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma of the helper phenotype, and Hodgkin's disease, EBV can contribute to the development of CD8-positive aggressive T-cell lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "This study characterizes the histogenesis of soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma (StEs) based upon an analysis of three tumors. Long-term cultured cell lines and nude mice xenografts were established from original neoplasms or from their metastases. Histologically they revealed a small round cell pattern without signs of differentiation. Several ultrastructural features of neural type were found; the same were also seen on culture cell lines. Moreover, immunohistochemical study for neural markers revealed the presence of HNK-1, NSE, LIRC-LON 36, S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilaments (70 kilodaltons), and chromogranin; some of these markers were present only in the transplants. Cytokeratin was also seen. The translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) was found in all three neoplasms together with other chromosomal abnormalities. N-myc RNA gave negative results whereas c-myc RNA was expressed. Therefore it may be postulated that StEs displays neuroectodermal features somewhat similar to those seen in peripheral neuroepithelioma as well as in atypical Ewing's sarcoma of bone.\r"

After a 3-week placebo washout period, 21 ambulatory subjects with mild hypertension (mean age, 57 years; 67% men; 76% white) randomly received isradipine or enalapril twice daily in a double-blind titration during 10 weeks. Both drugs achieved a 13% reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.01) with minimal symptomatic or laboratory toxicity. Although pill counts indicated near-perfect compliance (92% to 99% for both groups), the electronic monitor showed that fewer than half of all openings occurred at the prescribed interval of 12 +/- 2 hours. Modest overdispensing was documented in the 3 days before scheduled visits. The monitor confirmed that pill count misclassified compliance sufficiency in 22% of visits and permitted more discrete attribution for drug-associated adverse reactions and secondary resistance to treatment. We conclude that the electronic monitor reduces ambiguity about medication compliance and helps interpret both the biology and pharmacology of the trial.\r"

We measured insulin resistance in a group of non-obese, glucose-tolerant patients undergoing major elective surgery with an uncomplicated post-operative course. 2. Shortly after surgery, hyperglycaemia (7.3 +/- 0.6 versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/l glucose pre-surgery, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01) with normal insulin concentrations (73 +/- 15 versus 64 +/- 18 pmol/l) suggested the presence of insulin resistance. Counter-regulatory hormones were raised, whole-body protein oxidation was doubled (P less than 0.01) and energy expenditure was up by 18% (P less than 0.01). 3. Insulin sensitivity was quantified by clamping plasma glucose concentrations at 5.6 mmol/l during 24 h of total parenteral nutrition (15% protein, 55% glucose and 30% fat, supplying 1.25 times the measured resting energy expenditure) with a variable infusion of exogenous insulin. After surgery, eight times more insulin was needed than before surgery (14.14 +/- 1.15 versus 1.78 +/- 0.29 pmol min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.001) to maintain euglycemia. 4. After surgery, stimulation of net carbohydrate oxidation (18.8 +/- 1.4 versus 17.2 +/- 1.8 mumol min-1 kg-1 preoperatively, not significant), suppression of lipolysis and lipid oxidation and inhibition of ketogenesis occurred to the same extent as before surgery. Of the infused nutrients, the glucose was all oxidized, amino acids replaced endogenous protein losses (= neutral nitrogen balance) and lipids were stored. Insulin administration caused no further increment in oxygen consumption or energy expenditure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using a chart review of 225 patients, it was found that 28% had documented evidence of dysphagia. When dysphagia co-occurred with stroke, significantly more functional problems and medical complications were reported, as well as increased need for dietary modifications and alternative feeding methods. The dysphagic patients were more often aphasic and dysarthric and less able to communicate. Mental status was more likely to be reduced and the need for staff supervision during mealtime was increased. Dysphagic patients had significantly longer hospital stays, thus increasing the cost of their care. At discharge, almost half of them continued to need feeding modifications, which may have delayed rehabilitation or transfer to facilities with other levels of care. The dysphagia group clearly displayed a wide range of clinical symptoms that would alert staff to their risk for medical complications because of swallowing problems. We believe that this needs assessment clearly showed that a multidisciplinary dysphagia management program has the potential to enhance patient care while decreasing the cost of health care delivery for the hospital.\r"

  ".U": "91065237\r", 
  ".W": "The enzyme 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4 isomerase (3 beta-HSD) catalyzes an obligatory step in the conversion of pregnenolone and other 5-ene-3 beta-hydroxysteroids into progesterone as well as precursors of all androgens and estrogens in the ovary. Since 3 beta-HSD is likely to be an important target for regulation by pituitary hormones, we have studied the effect of chronic treatment with LH (hCG), FSH, and PRL on ovarian 3 beta-HSD expression and activity in hypophysectomized adult female rats. Human CG (hCG) [10 IU, twice a day (bid)], ovine FSH (0.5 microgram, bid), and ovine PRL (1 mg, bid) were administered, singly or in combination, for a period of 10 days starting 15 days after hypophysectomy. In hypophysectomized rats, PRL exerted a potent inhibitory effect on all the parameters studied. In fact, PRL caused a 81% decrease in ovarian 3 beta-HSD mRNA content accompanied by a similar decrease in 3 beta-HSD activity and protein levels. In addition, ovarian weight decreased by 40% whereas serum progesterone fell dramatically from 1.92 nmol/liter to undetectable levels after treatment with PRL. Whereas hCG alone had only slight stimulatory effects on 3 beta-HSD mRNA, protein content and activity levels, treatment with the gonadotropin partially or completely reversed the potent inhibitory effects of oPRL on all the parameters measured. FSH, on the other hand, had no significant effect on 3 beta-HSD expression and activity. In situ hybridization experiments using the 35S-labeled rat ovary 3 beta-HSD cDNA probe show that the inhibitory effect of PRL is exerted primarily on luteal cell 3 beta-HSD expression and activity. On the other hand, it can be seen that hCG stimulates 3 beta-HSD mRNA accumulation in interstitial cells. The present data show that hCG and PRL exert potent and opposite cell-specific effects on ovarian 3 beta-HSD expression, activity, and content in the rat ovary. Moreover, the present study could suggest that female infertility associated with hyperprolactinemia in women could well be related, at least in part, to the potent inhibitory effect of PRL on ovarian 3 beta-HSD expression and activity.\r"

Three structurally different binding proteins (BPs) have been isolated and cloned; each has distinct tissue specific expression and unique properties. We report here that testicular cells synthesize a specific subset of these binding proteins. Ligand blot analysis and RNA blot hybridization indicates that cultured peritubular cells synthesize primarily IGFBP-2. In contrast, as determined by ligand blot, RNA blot hybridization and N-linked deglycosylated studies, IGFBP-3 is predominantly synthesized by the Sertoli cell. In a dose dependent fashion, FSH markedly reduces the levels of IGFBP-3 in Sertoli cell conditioned medium. Similarly, isoproterenol, (Bu)2cAMP and cholera toxin also markedly reduce the abundance of IGFBP-3 in conditioned media. In contrast, IGF-I increases the concentrations of IGFBP-3 with the concentration required for half-maximal stimulation, approximately 20 ng/ml. Consistent with a peritubular cell origin, IGFBP-2 may be the predominant species found in interstitial fluid. In summary, our data reveal that the IGFBPs are expressed in a cell type specific manner in the testis. The opposing effects of FSH and IGF-I on Sertoli cell IGFBP-3 expression suggests a mechanism by which the IGF-I biological activity on Sertoli cell might be influenced.\r"

  ".U": "91065242\r", 
  ".W": "2-Hydroxyestradiol (2-OH-E2) stimulates progestin secretion by granulosa cells, but the intracellular locus of the stimulatory effect has not been clarified. The objectives of the present studies were to 1) determine the role of de novo sterol synthesis in the effect of 2-OH-E2 on progestin biosynthesis, and 2) examine the effects of 2-OH-E2 on cholesterol side-chain cleavage (SCC) activity and the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) for P450scc. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase with lovastatin (5 micrograms/ml) or mevinolin (5 micrograms/ml) reduced FSH- and 2-OH-E2-stimulated (but not E2-stimulated) progesterone production. Mevalonate (20 mM) enhanced basal progesterone production and reversed the inhibitory effect of lovastatin but did not affect progesterone biosynthesis in the presence of 2-OH-E2. As an index of the activity of cholesterol SCC enzyme, granulosa cells were exposed to 25-hydroxycholesterol (10 micrograms/ml) for 24 h and progesterone secretion monitored. Conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol into progesterone was stimulated 2- to 3-fold by maximally effective concentrations of 2-OH-E2, E2, and FSH. 2-OH-E2 and/or E2 further enhanced 25-hydroxycholesterol conversion in the presence of FSH, LH, and epinephrine. Aminoglutethimide, an inhibitor of SCC, reduced 2-OH-E2- and 2-OH-E2 plus FSH-stimulated progesterone production by 97% and 95%, respectively. 2-OH-E2 also increased basal (by 2 to 3-fold) and FSH-stimulated (to 3.5-fold of FSH-treated controls) levels of mRNA for cytochrome P450scc. Collectively, our studies support the hypothesis that 2-OH-E2-enhanced progesterone biosynthesis by porcine granulosa cells is dependent on de novo cholesterol synthesis and is associated with increased levels of the mRNA encoding cytochrome P-450scc, which leads to increases in basal and gonadotropin-induced SCC activity.\r"

  ".U": "91065244\r", 
  ".W": "The present studies demonstrate that the beta-cell line RINr1046-38 (RIN-38) retains the capability to secrete insulin in response to glucose. The maximal effect of glucose was a 5- to 9-fold stimulation of insulin secretion from RIN-38 cells. This glucose-induced insulin secretion was maximal at 0.6 mM and was modulated by other secretagogues. Potassium concentrations of 10 mM, adenylate cyclase activators (glucagon-like peptide-1 and forskolin), and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (isobutylmethylxanthine) potentiated glucose-induced insulin secretion, but had little or no effect on insulin secretion in the absence of glucose. Potassium concentrations of 20 mM or more, glibenclamide, and carbachol (Cch) stimulated insulin secretion 8- to 12-fold in the absence of glucose, while only Cch potentiated the effect of glucose on insulin secretion. Amino acids (alanine, arginine, leucine, and ketoisocaproate) also stimulated insulin secretion. The alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine (1 microM), low extracellular calcium (less than or equal to 0.5 mM), and extended culture of RIN-38 cells at low glucose concentrations (0.33 mM) inhibited the stimulatory effect of glucose on insulin secretion. Insulin secretion was retained in RIN-38 cells for up to 98 passages. However, extended passage was associated with a decline in cellular insulin content (83% decline over 89 passages). In addition, high passage cells lost the ability to secrete insulin in response to glucose, but continued to respond to other secretagogues (K+, alanine, and carbachol). In fact, in the absence of glucose the effect of Cch on insulin secretion was well maintained in high passage cells (8- and 9.9-fold increase in insulin secretion, passages 9 and 70, respectively). Thus, low passage RIN-38 cells secrete insulin in response to glucose and other insulin secretagogues. High passage cells do not respond to glucose, but continue to respond to other secretagogues. Based on these results we propose that high and low passage RIN-38 cells provide a model for examining molecular mechanisms of glucose-induced insulin secretion. In addition, these findings emphasize that passage information is essential for interpretation of secretion studies with RIN cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "Serum concentrations of PRL and GH increase and decrease, respectively, during the progression from nonpregnancy through lactation. However, it is unknown whether the secretory capacities and/or relative abundance of cells that release PRL or GH are altered during these physiological states. In the present study anterior pituitaries from adult virgin, gestating, and early or late lactating female rats were dispersed with trypsin and subsequently assayed for PRL and GH release using reverse hemolytic plaque assays. We found that the relative abundance of PRL-secreting cells was greater and that of GH cells lower in pituitaries from lactating females than in those from virgins. Moreover, the relative amounts of both PRL and GH released per cell were diminished in gestating and lactating females. For PRL, this decrease could be accounted for by an increase in the number of cells that released small quantities of hormone. We then performed simultaneous plaque assays to determine whether the shifts in the relative proportions of PRL and GH secretors were due to changes in the percentages of cells that secrete each hormone alone or in the fraction that releases both PRL and GH concurrently. Variations in both single and dual hormone-secreting cells appear to contribute to the overall fluctuations in the relative abundance of PRL and GH cells during these physiological transitions. We conclude that the additional PRL secretors present during lactation may arise from cells that previously released only GH, and that this functional interconversion of GH and PRL secretors might involve an intermediate cell type, the mammosomatotrope.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of gonadotropins and gonadal steroids on androgen-binding protein (ABP) production by the testis and its secretion into the blood and transport into the epididymis were studied in 20- and 30-day-old rats. These animals had been treated with hCG, FSH, the Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist [Ac-D2Nal1,D4ClDPhe2,D3Pal3,Arg5,DGlu6(AA) ,DAla10]LHRH (antagonist), testosterone propionate, or estradiol benzoate, alone or in combination, for 10 days before assessment of ABP. Antagonist administration suppressed the testicular content (nanograms per organ) of ABP to below control (untreated) levels in both age groups. When hCG or testosterone was given along with the antagonist, they overcame the effect of the antagonist, and the resultant ABP values exceeded untreated control levels in both the 20- and 30-day-old rats. Treatment of rats with these hormones in the absence of the GnRH antagonist also elevated the ABP content of the testis above that of untreated controls. FSH administered with antagonist was able to prevent the antagonist-induced suppression of testicular ABP content. When rats were treated with FSH alone, the content of ABP in the testis was increased above untreated control levels in the 30-day-old group, but not in the 20-day-old group. The simultaneous administration of FSH and hCG did not result in an increase in testicular ABP content above that caused by hCG or testosterone alone. The increase in the ABP content of the testis caused by FSH administration was only about one sixth that caused by hCG or testosterone. Since testosterone or hCG, even in the presence of antagonist, was able to maximally stimulate ABP production by the testis of both age groups, we conclude that testosterone is the major in vivo regulator of its synthesis. Only combined treatment with hCG and FSH was able to increase transport of ABP into the epididymis of 20-day-old rats. All treatments that increased the testicular content of ABP in the 30-day-old rats also increased its transport into the epididymis. Treatments that drastically reduced the content of ABP in the testis of 20-day-old rats (antagonist, estradiol, estradiol plus antagonist) also reduced ABP secretion into the serum. Only treatment with estradiol reduced the secretion of ABP into the serum of 30-day-old rats. None of the treatments increased the ABP secretion into the bloodstream above untreated control levels.\r"

  ".U": "91065251\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (99-126) in vitro modulates the bioactivity of this hormone. The potential physiological relevance of this observation was revealed in latter studies showing that endogenous proANF can be 32PO4-biosynthetically labeled by primary cultured atrial myocytes and by atrial appendage explants. The site and extent of proANF phosphorylation were different, however, in these two model systems. Whereas proANF extracted from atrial explants was phosphorylated on the bioactive, carboxy (C)-terminal portion of the molecule [ANF(99-126)], cultured atrial myocytes phosphorylated proANF on the amino (N)-terminal portion of the prohormone molecule [ANF(1-98)]. It was the goal of this study, therefore, to determine whether the bioactive region of proANF, ANF(99-126), is phosphorylated in vivo. ProANF was obtained by acid extraction of isolated rat atrial secretory granules followed by purification using reverse phase-HPLC. Analysis of purified 125I-labeled proANF by isoelectric focusing (IEF) revealed two bands with isoelectric points of 5.3 and 5.0. The more acidic band comigrated on IEF gels with 32PO4-biosynthetically labeled proANF obtained from primary cultures of atrial myocytes, suggesting that this species of proANF represented endogenously phosphorylated proANF. The more acidic band accounted for only 15-25% of the total proANF found in the mature atrial secretory granule. The phosphorylation state of ANF(99-126) produced by thrombin cleavage of secretory granule proANF was examined using three complementary methods: 1) cation-exchange HPLC, 2) amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and 3) anti-ANF(99-105) antibody immunoreactivity. Evidence from these three independent approaches indicated that proANF is not phosphorylated on the C-terminal portion of the molecule in vivo. Therefore, phosphorylation is not a physiological regulator of ANF(99-126) bioactivity.\r"

  ".W": "The role of GnRH in regulating gonadotropin subunit gene expression was examined in adult female rats. Animals were ovariectomized, estradiol implants inserted sc, and jugular cannulae placed into the right atria. On the next day, animals were given GnRH pulses (saline to controls) every 30 min for up to 48 h and alpha, LH beta, and FSH beta mRNA levels measured by hybridization to cDNA probes. To determine the effects of GnRH treatment duration, rats received GnRH pulses (25 ng at 30-min intervals) for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. FSH beta mRNA was increased (by 92%) after 6 h of pulses and remained elevated through 48 h. alpha mRNA was not increased until 12 h (27% increase) and rose further (57%) by 48 h. LH beta mRNA levels were only transiently increased at 12 h (67%) and values were not different from saline controls after 24 or 48 h. To examine whether the rise in serum PRL which is characteristic of the ovariectomized-estradiol animal model was responsible for the decrease in LH beta mRNA responsiveness to GnRH over longer durations, studies were repeated in bromocriptine-treated animals (0.6 mg sc, twice daily). The results showed similar response patterns for all three subunit mRNAs including the decrease in LH beta after 48 h. A third experiment examined the effect of varying GnRH pulse amplitude (0.5-250 ng/pulse at 30-min intervals) over 12 h. alpha mRNA levels were increased by all GnRH doses greater than 5 ng with maximum responses after 250 ng pulses. LH and FSH beta mRNAs were both elevated by GnRH pulse doses of 0.5-25 ng (P less than 0.05 vs. saline controls). Maximal increases (2-fold) were seen after 5 ng pulses for LH beta and after 15-ng pulses for FSH beta mRNA. These results show that pulsatile GnRH increases FSH beta mRNA more rapidly than alpha or LH beta mRNAs in female rats. In addition, high amplitude GnRH pulses increase only alpha mRNA, whereas both LH beta and FSH beta mRNAs show maximum responses to lower doses. The data suggest that alterations in the amplitude of the GnRH pulsatile signal can exert differential effects on gonadotropin gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Testosterone (T) inhibits GnRH secretion and can also modulate the effects of GnRH on gonadotropin synthesis and secretion. To assess the effect of T on GnRH stimulation of alpha, LH beta, and FSH beta mRNA expression, we replaced T at three levels to reproduce low (1.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml), medium (3.5 +/- 0.3 ng/ml), and high (6.2 +/- 0.6 ng/ml) physiological plasma concentrations. Additionally, as peripheral conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or estradiol (E2) may mediate T action, the effects of GnRH pulses in the presence of DHT and E2 were also studied. Male rats were castrated, and steroids were replaced via implants containing either T (three doses) or DHT or E2 (two doses each). GnRH pulses (10-250 ng/pulse) were administered iv at 30-min intervals for 48 h. Pituitary subunit mRNA concentrations, gonadotropin content, and LH and FSH secretion were determined. The patterns of alpha, LH beta, and FSH beta mRNA responses to increasing GnRH pulse amplitude were similar at all concentrations of plasma T. Alpha mRNA concentrations were increased 2- to 4-fold by GnRH pulses. At the same plasma T concentration, all doses of GnRH produced similar increases in alpha mRNA, but the response tended to be lower at the higher (6.2 ng/ml) levels of T. LH beta mRNA showed a clear dependence on GnRH pulse amplitude, with the maximum responses (2- to 3-fold) occurring after 10- to 25-ng GnRH pulses. At the higher (3.5 and 6.2 ng/ml) T concentrations, the dose-response curve was shifted to the left. The lowest GnRH pulse dose (10 ng) produced maximum responses, and LH beta mRNA increments in response to the higher GnRH doses were suppressed. FSH beta mRNA concentrations were increased by T in saline-pulsed controls. FSH beta mRNA responses were similar (2- to 3-fold) after all GnRH doses and at all concentrations of T. Increasing GnRH pulse doses reduced the pituitary content of both LH and FSH at all levels of T. Acute LH secretion was maximal after 10- and 25-ng pulses of GnRH when plasma T was low, but increased progressively with GnRH dose at the highest plasma T concentrations. Plasma FSH did not show any differential responsiveness to GnRH pulse dose or to increasing plasma T. Thus, LH synthesis and secretion are affected more than those of FSH by changing plasma concentrations of T. T may modulate posttranslational events in LH secretion. The higher GnRH doses effected LH release without increasing LH beta mRNA in the presence of higher physiological concentrations of T.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91065257\r", 
  ".W": "At the time of onset of puberty in the male rat, between 15 and 25 days of age, we have reported that pulsatile GnRH secretion by hypothalamic explants showed an increased frequency as indicated by the reduction of the mean interpulse interval from 66 to 40 min (P less than 0.05). This study aimed to evaluate whether these changes in GnRH secretion involved a self-regulatory mechanism. A 7.5-min exposure of explants obtained at 50 days to 0.1 microM superagonist D-TRP6-PRO9-N-Et-GnRH (GnRH-A) resulted in a delay of the next GnRH secretory pulse so that the mean interpulse interval increased from 35 to 67 min (P less than 0.001). In addition, after a 7.5-min exposure to GnRH-A, there was a 15-min period with absent or reduced release of GnRH in response to 50 microM veratridine, a depolarizing agent. A similar refractory period of 15 min was observed using explants obtained at 25 and 50 days whereas, at 15 days, the period of refractoriness lasted for 52.5 min. The inhibitory effect of GnRH-A on the subsequent response to veratridine occurred at similar concentrations of GnRH-A at the three studied ages and the inhibition was prevented using an antagonist of GnRH together with GnRH-A. The involvement of GnRH itself in an autofeedback mechanism was evaluated by studying the period of refractoriness separating two GnRH pulses elicited by 7.5-min exposures to veratridine. The initial responsiveness to veratridine was recovered after a refractory period of 52.5, 22.5, and 15 min when studied at 15, 25, and 50 days, respectively. While refractoriness occurred during repeated depolarization with K+ or veratridine, such an effect was not observed using N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). During exposure to GnRH-A, the NMDA-induced release of GnRH was only reduced by 38% whereas veratridine-induced secretion showed a 94% reduction. Thus, exogenous activation of NMDA-sensitive receptors could bypass the inhibitory autofeedback. We conclude that: 1) pulsatile GnRH secretion is controlled by an inhibitory autofeedback involving NMDA sensitive receptors, 2) the increased frequency of pulsatile GnRH secretion at onset of puberty may be related to a reduced sensitivity of the hypothalamic pulse generator to an inhibitory autofeedback.\r"

Thyroid hormones reduce TRH release and cellular levels of TRH mRNA. Using quantitative in situ hybridization to measure changes in cellular levels of various neuropeptide mRNAs, the present studies demonstrate that cold exposure also increases cellular levels of TRH mRNA in neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supporting the concept that TRH mRNA levels are reflective of TRH secretion in these neurons. The effect of cold appeared to be specific for TRH expression in the PVN, because cold exposure did not influence cellular levels of TRH in the reticular thalamic nucleus or beta-actin and oxytocin mRNAs in the PVN. Cellular levels of mRNA encoding CRH were elevated by cold exposure. This latter observation is predictable based on the cold-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. There was a 24-h rhythm and a time of day difference in the effect of cold on TRH mRNA levels in the PVN. Time of day differences in the effect of cold on CRH mRNA levels were not apparent. Cold exposure appeared to elevate TRH mRNA levels in all neurons of the PVN, indicating that the neurally mediated effect of cold on TRH expression can override the inhibitory effects of circulating T3 within the same neuronal population.\r"

The beta-subunit confers hormone specificity, while the alpha-subunit is homologous within a species. To help in determining the antigenic structure of the common alpha-subunit, six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the free or heterodimeric alpha-subunit of human (h) gonadotropic hormones have been prepared and, along with two previously isolated mAbs, have been characterized for binding specificity to alpha- and beta-subunits and the human glycoprotein hormones, CG, LH, FSH, and TSH. Each mAb was derived from hybidomas of FO myeloma cells fused with spleen cells from mice immunized with free alpha-subunit, hCG or hFSH. mAbs A101, A102, and E512 were specific for the alpha-subunit but showed the highest affinity for the intact hormone; K2.18, K94.6, E501, E502, and E511 were specific for free alpha. All of the antibodies inhibited binding of 125I-hCG to luteal membrane receptor, and 125I-labeled mAbs did not recognize hCG/receptor complex. Characterization by two-site binding assays using alpha, hCG, or hFSH as antigen revealed that all the mAbs bind to unique sites on alpha which may be overlapping, and which are modified in the intact hormone. The antigenic sites for mAbs E502, E511, and K2.18 are at least partially linear because they bind to reduced, carboxymethylated alpha.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to resolve previous controversies regarding the effect of atriopeptin on the secretion of ACTH in vivo. Male Wistar rats were used throughout. The animals were subjected to lesioning of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) or sham operation and implanted with indwelling jugular cannulae 5 days later for blood sampling and drug infusion. Two days after the insertion of the cannulae the animals were treated with saline or 103-126 amino acid residue atriopeptin iv: a bolus injection was given (200 or 40 pmol/rat) followed by an infusion (40 or 8 pmol/min) which was maintained for the entire duration of the experiment (70 min). Ten minutes after the bolus of atriopeptin the animals received iv a combination of 1 pmol 41-residue CRF and 10 pmol arginine vasopressin (CRF/AVP) to stimulate ACTH secretion. Serial blood samples (0.1 ml) were obtained at -10 min and immediately before the injection of CRF/AVP and at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min afterwards. Plasma ACTH concentration was measured by RIA. In sham-operated rats CRF/AVP caused a 4-fold increase in plasma ACTH which peaked at 5 min and returned to baseline by 60 min. In sham-operated rats the higher dose of atriopeptin (200 pmol bolus, 40 pmol/min infusion) did not alter the effect of the stimulus between 5 and 30 min, and augmented plasma ACTH at 60 min. The smaller dose of atriopeptin reduced plasma ACTH at 10 and 20 min by 54% and 48%, respectively, and also decreased by 48% the net amount of ACTH released over 30 min in response to CRF/AVP. When given alone, the higher dose of atriopeptin caused a persistent (60 min) 10-13% reduction of mean arterial blood pressure, while the lower dose decreased blood pressure by about 9% for less than 10 min. In parallel, the higher dose of atriopeptin increased plasma ACTH concentration while the lower dose produced no change. In PVN-lesioned rats the CRF/AVP induced ACTH response was similar to that seen in sham-operated controls. Only the higher dose of atriopeptin was tested, and this markedly reduced CRF/AVP stimulated ACTH secretion at 5-60 min after CRF/AVP. Given alone, atriopeptin had no marked effect on plasma ACTH in PVN-lesioned rats, while its hypotensive action was similar to that in sham-operated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91065275\r", 
  ".W": "Ovulation in mammals is preceded by surges of the two pituitary gonadotropins, LH and FSH. Although previous studies have shown that purified FSH induces ovulation when administered to hypophysectomized rats, proof that FSH has inherent ovulatory potential is lacking because all FSH preparations have varying degrees of residual LH. To determine if FSH alone can induce ovulation, we generated LH-free recombinant FSH (RCFSH) by culturing eukaryotic cells transfected with the human common alpha- and FSH beta-subunit genes. Immature hypophysectomized rats were implanted with estrogen and then primed with PMSG (15 IU, sc). Fifty-two hours later, either RCFSH or hCG was injected (sc) to induce ovulation. A dose-dependent increase in the ovulation rate was stimulated by RCFSH, reaching 100% ovulation at 18 IU/rat, comparable to that achieved with 12 IU hCG. The maximum number of oocytes ovulated per ovary was similar for both groups. Ovulation induced by either RCFSH or hCG was time dependent and associated with a periovulatory increase in the ovarian activity and message levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator, a protease important in the preovulatory degradation of the follicle wall. Because PMSG has inherent LH-like activity in rats, we also implanted hypophysectomized rats with a minipump (sc) that released RCFSH (4 IU/day) to induce follicle growth. Fifty-two hours later, a single sc injection of a surge dose (20 IU) of RCFSH also induced ovulation, further indicating the ability of FSH alone to induce both follicle growth and ovulation. To test whether FSH can also induce ovulation in adult animals, rats were hypophysectomized on proestrous morning and treated with increasing doses of RCFSH (ip) to induce ovulation. At 7.8 IU RCFSH, all rats ovulated, with about 10 oocytes/rat. These results demonstrate that RCFSH is capable of inducing ovulation in hypophysectomized immature and adult rats, with associated increases in ovarian tissue-type plasminogen activator gene expression. Thus, FSH may be involved in follicular rupture in addition to its role in follicle recruitment and maturation. The preovulatory surges of both LH and FSH may represent a protective mechanism to ensure an optimal ovulatory stimulus. The present finding also serves as the basis to formulate new ovulation induction protocols.\r"

  ".U": "91065279\r", 
  ".W": "Membrane receptors for LHRH were evaluated in Dunning R3327 prostate cancers and rat anterior pituitaries. The receptors were characterized both in untreated animals and after in vivo treatment with microcapsules of the agonist D-Trp6-LHRH and a sustained delivery system releasing different doses (23.8, 47.6, 71.4 micrograms/day) of LHRH antagonist [Ac-D-Nal(2)1-D-Phe(4Cl)2-D-Pal(3)3,D-Cit6, D-Ala10]-LHRH (SB-75). The therapy, which lasted 8 weeks, strongly inhibited tumor growth. A group of normal Sprague-Dawley male rats was also treated for 6 weeks with microcapsules of SB-75 releasing 25 micrograms/day. In the Dunning tumors from the control group, ligand [125I, D-Trp6]-LHRH was bound to two classes of binding sites [dissociation constant, class a (Kda) = 1.01 +/- 0.30 x 10(-9) M; Kdb = 1.71 +/- 0.41 x 10(-6) M; maximal binding capacity of receptors, class a (Bmaxa) = 48.66 +/- 22.13 fmol/mg of protein; Bmaxb = 92.10 +/- 29.40 pmol/mg of protein] in both kinetic and equilibrium studies. Treatment with D-Trp6-LHRH produced down-regulation of membrane receptors for LHRH in Dunning tumors. Microcapsules of SB-75 resulted in dose-dependent up-regulation of binding sites for LHRH in Dunning tumors. Analysis of the binding data showed that interaction of labeled D-Trp6-LHRH with binding sites in anterior pituitaries was consistent with the presence of a single class of noncooperative receptors (Kd = 43.75 x 10(-9) M; Bmax = 5.25 pmol/mg membrane proteins). Prolonged treatment with microcapsules of D-Trp6-LHRH reduced both Bmax and Kd. Lower doses of SB-75 (23.8 and 47.6 micrograms/day) produced up-regulation, whereas the highest dose (71.4 micrograms/day) resulted in down-regulation of binding sites for LHRH in rat pituitaries. In normal Sprague-Dawley rats, treatment with microcapsules of SB-75 (25 micrograms/day) for 6 weeks produced a slight increase in the number of available binding sites (Bmax = 2.35 +/- 0.82 pmol/mg membrane protein) and a moderate decrease in affinity (Kd = 35.10 +/- 15.19 x 10(-9) M) of pituitary membrane receptors for LHRH. The findings provide additional support for the view that LHRH analogs exert direct effects on tumor cells. Our findings indicate that prolonged treatment with high doses of modern LHRH antagonists produces down-regulation of pituitary receptors. Our work in tumors also implies that some differences may exist between LHRH receptors, even in the same tissue, leading to the concept of subclassification of LHRH receptors.\r"

We have examined in GH4C1 cells the effect of isotonic ethanol on cell volume measured with a Coulter counter, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) monitored with fura-2, and PRL secretion analyzed in a perifusion system. Isotonic ethanol caused prompt cell swelling and an explosive rise in both [Ca2+]i and PRL secretion proportional to the concentration of ethanol between 5-120 mM. The increases in both [Ca2+]i and PRL secretion induced by 80 mM isotonic ethanol were essentially abolished by removal of medium Ca2+ or by nifedipine; the nifedipine IC50 was approximately 20 nM. Cell swelling induced by hyposmolarity or isotonic urea similarly increased both [Ca2+]i and PRL secretion. Hypertonic ethanol did not cause cell swelling and was ineffective in inducing an increase in either [Ca2+]i or PRL secretion. These data suggest that in GH4C1 cells a major mechanism by which ethanol stimulates PRL secretion is to induce cell swelling, thus producing enhanced Ca2+ influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has demonstrated that 4-week protein restriction of the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus) increases both adrenocortical cell sensitivity to ACTH and corticosteroidogenic capacity. In the present study we examined the transience (study 1) and the persistence (study 2) of this effect of protein restriction. In study 1, two strains of domestic fowl were used: a slower-growing White Leghorn strain and a faster-growing Cobb broiler strain. Cockerels (2 weeks old) were fed isocaloric diets containing either low (L; 5% or 8%) or control (C; 20%) levels of soy protein for 2 weeks, and then were either switched to the alternate diet (C-L, L-C) or maintained on the initial diet (C-C, L-L) for an additional 2 weeks. Cockerels were killed at 6 weeks of age. In study 2, White Leghorn cockerels (2 weeks old) were fed either diet for 4 weeks and then switched to or maintained on the control diet for an additional 4 weeks (i.e. C vs. restriction followed by repletion). In this study cockerels were killed at 10 weeks of age. In both studies highly enriched populations of adrenocortical cells were isolated from cockerel adrenal glands, and their steroidogenic properties (basal and maximally induced corticosterone and cAMP production; steroidogenic agent ED50 values) were evaluated in 2-h suspension incubations. In study 1, regardless of strain, the greater the length of the restriction period, the greater the magnitude of maximal cellular corticosterone production induced by ACTH; the average value for 4-week restriction (L-L) was 39.5% greater than that for 2-week restriction (L-C, C-L) and 117.5% greater than that for control (C-C). In addition, the value for restriction from 4-6 weeks of age (C-L) was 34% greater than that for restriction from 2-4 weeks of age (L-C), suggesting that the enhancement of maximal ACTH-induced corticosterone production after a 2-week restriction interval might be transient. Although there were no strain differences in the effect of protein restriction on maximal ACTH-induced corticosterone production, there were strain differences in its effect on cellular sensitivity to ACTH, as indicated by the ACTH ED50 values (the lower the ED50 value, the greater tha cellular sensitivity). With the White Leghorn strain, the greater the duration of protein restriction, the greater the adrenocortical cell sensitivity to ACTH; the sensitivity of L-L cells was 3.0 times the sensitivities of L-C and C-L cells and 4.1 times the sensitivity of C-C cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Ovine FSH (oFSH) elicited specific [Ca2+]i increases, which reached their highest value within 5 min of the onset of stimulation and were sustained for 10-15 min. [Ca2+]i usually returned to prestimulated levels and cells regained full responsiveness to a second exposure to oFSH within 20 min. The effect of FSH was not blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP were able to mimic similar increases in [Ca2+]i in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. In contrast, the oFSH-induced [Ca2+]i rises were abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil completely abolished the oFSH-induced [Ca2+]i rise, but not the 8-bromo-cAMP- or the forskolin-induced [Ca2+]i rise. In summary, we have demonstrated that [Ca2+]i is regulated by oFSH in single swine granulosa cells. We propose that the transducing pathway for this FSH effect might not involve cAMP, and that whichever second messenger is responsible for the Ca2+ signal generation acts upon plasma membrane Ca2+ channels.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate early events in GH action, we examined whether GH altered the expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA in 3T3-F442A cells. The rapid induction of these early response protooncogenes is one of the initial events in stimulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by a variety of growth factors. In 3T3-F442A preadipocytes, which differentiate in response to GH, treatment with GH for 15-30 min transiently increased the expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA at GH concentrations in the physiological range (10-500 ng/ml). Both genes were superinduced by GH in the presence of cycloheximide. Nuclear run-on experiments indicated that the effect of GH on c-fos and c-jun occurred at the level of gene transcription, indicating that in the 3T3-F442A preadipocytes, GH acts similarly to other growth factors which induce c-fos and c-jun. Chronic preincubation with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate interfered with the induction of c-fos by GH, suggesting that diacylglycerol and protein kinase C are involved in this effect of GH. Insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin were less effective than equimolar concentrations of GH in inducing c-fos expression. Taken together, these findings are consistent with coordinated expression of c-fos and c-jun playing an early role in responses to GH in 3T3-F442A cells.\r"

  ".W": "The role of inhibin and activin in the initiation of follicular development, growth, and atresia was examined. Human recombinant inhibin (1 microgram) was unilaterally injected into the ovarian intrabursal space of 25-day-old rats. The contralateral ovary served as a control. Recruited growing follicles (350-500 microns) were observed 24 h after injection. The accumulation of follicles was greater in the inhibin-treated ovaries than in contralateral control ovaries. Moreover, the size distribution of the follicles was similar to the distribution of follicles recruited by systemic exogenous PMSG treatment. The effect of inhibin plus PMSG on follicular development was not different from that of PMSG treatment alone. Injection of human recombinant activin (1 microgram) into the ovarian bursa caused follicular atresia. Activin therapy blocked the follicular development caused by PMSG treatment. The effect of inhibin and activin on follicular development was further characterized by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into dividing cells. Inhibin enhanced follicular thymidine incorporation, while activin decreased granulosa cell proliferation. Furthermore, receptors for inhibin-A (6.4 x 10(3) receptors/cell) and activin-A (2.3 X 10(4) receptors/cell) were identified on granulosa cells. The evidence suggests that inhibin and activin act in a paracrine manner to regulate follicular development, inhibin as a follicular growth signal and activin as an atretagenic signal.\r"

This study provides further evidence for this notion, as expression of ANP mRNA in the thymus is altered in response to administration of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone to rats (1.5 mg/kg). This drug causes involution of the thymic gland and at day 4 after steroid exposure a striking increase (up to 30 fold) in mRNA coding for ANP was observed. The increase of the ANP precursor was found to be 4-fold as compared to saline treated controls. During regeneration of the thymus the mRNA and precursor levels normalize, reaching control values the day 18 after dexamethasone. The strong stimulation of the thymus ANP system subsequent to the glucocorticoid may suggest a critical function of this peptide in mechanisms leading to cellular depletion or during the regeneration of the gland after exposure to the steroid.\r"

Only pig and human epidermal ceramides have been extensively characterized and the structures of the ceramides of cultured keratinocytes have not been previously investigated. In the present studies, we have characterized the ceramides synthesized by organotypic lifted mouse keratinocyte cultures for the first time and compared them to the ceramides of intact mouse epidermis. Both mouse epidermis and cultures contained five ceramides, ceramide 1 being the least polar and ceramide 5 the most polar. Ceramide 1 was a group of acylceramides, i.e., very-long-chain omega-hydroxyceramides with an ester-linked nonhydroxy fatty acid. Ceramide 2 contained medium-length saturated nonhydroxy fatty acids. (In culture, the ceramide 2 band was split into two parts with the slightly more polar ceramide 2' containing short-chain saturated nonhydroxy fatty acids.) Ceramide 5 contained short-chain alpha-hydroxy fatty acids. The structures of ceramides 1, 2, and 5 were analagous to those of pig and human epidermis. Mouse epidermal ceramide 3 was quite unusual, containing beta-hydroxy fatty acids, a structure not previously identified among mammalian ceramides. In contrast, culture ceramide 3 was composed of omega-hydroxy fatty acids with a chain-length distribution similar to that of ceramide 1. Mouse ceramide 4 was composed of fatty acids with chromatographic mobility similar to hydroxy fatty acids but with different chemical reactivity; it remains only partially characterized. Culture ceramide 4 was present in quantities too small for analysis. All ceramides in mouse epidermis and cultures contained only sphingosine bases, whereas pig and human ceramides also contain phytosphingosine. These results indicate that considerable diversity of ceramide structures occurs among mammalian species and that cultured keratinocytes may only partially reproduce the in vivo complement of ceramides. Using labeled serine in keratinocyte cultures, we have also demonstrated the de novo synthesis of ceramides and the transfer of label from glucosylceramides to ceramides during terminal differentiation of lifted cultures. The covalently bound corneocyte lipid envelope, which has recently been characterized in pig and human epidermis, was also present in mouse epidermis and was reproduced by the lifted cultures. Very-long-chain omega-hydroxyceramides were the dominant bound lipid and labeling studies in culture indicated that they were derived from ceramides synthesized in the viable epidermis.\r"

Only cell line SK-N-SH reacted with a monoclonal antibody, HMSA-2, shown to recognize melanosomal glycoproteins. To further characterize the melanocytic lineages of SK-N-SH, three morphologically distinct clones designated SK-N-SH-N (neuroblast type), SK-N-SH-F (fibroblast type), and SK-N-SH-EP (epithelial type) were established by colony formation cloning. By fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and tyrosinase assay, we found that only SK-N-SH-EP and SK-N-SH-F reacted with HMSA-2 and had tyrosinase activity. These results suggest that epithelial-type and fibroblast-type cells appear to possess the melanocytic potential, but not neuroblast-type cells. Furthermore, SK-N-SH-EP was found to spontaneously convert to neuroblast-type or fibroblast-type cells, whereas SK-N-SH-N and SK-N-SH-F clones have remained morphologically stable. Our results suggest that at least one neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH, may be an excellent model for investigating clonal maturation and the melanocytic differentiation of neuroblastoma.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of recombinant human interferon alpha 2a (rIFN alpha), recombinant human interferon beta 1 (rIFN beta), and recombinant human interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) cultured in vitro was studied in various rIFN concentrations (0.1 IU/ml-10(4) IU/ml) over 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 d. Cell morphology and ultrastructure, cell proliferation, expression of class II alloantigens (HLA-DR and HLA-DQ), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were investigated using an in vitro technique established in our laboratory. All rIFN tested induced alterations of typical HDMEC morphology; the cells became spindle-shaped and fibroblastoid, although they maintained their endothelial cell marker expression. Also, all IFN dose- and time-dependently inhibited the proliferation of HDMEC in vitro (rIFN alpha greater than beta greater than gamma), whereby rIFN alpha exerted the strongest growth-inhibitory effect. Alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) immunocytochemistry of the cultured cells showed dose- and time-dependent stimulation of ICAM-1 and class II antigen expression only by rIFN gamma (HLA-DR greater than HLA-DQ), rIFN alpha and beta did not exert any immunomodulatory activity on HDMEC in vitro. These results indicate that HDMEC are an important target for the action of IFN. Besides growth inhibition, it seems that rIFN gamma in particular may be involved in the modulation of leucocyte adhesion and trafficking by altering the immunophenotype of the endothelial cell population.\r"

Here, microscopic silica beads were precoated with carrier protein, exposed to low concentrations of kinesin, and individually manipulated with a single-beam gradient-force optical particle trap ('optical tweezers') directly onto microtubules. Optical tweezers greatly improved the efficiency of the bead assay, particularly at the lowest kinesin concentrations (corresponding to approximately 1 molecule per bead). Beads incubated with excess kinesin moved smoothly along a microtubule for many micrometres, but beads carrying from 0.17-3 kinesin molecules per bead, moved, on average, only about 1.4 microns and then spontaneously released from the microtubule. Application of the optical trap directly behind such moving beads often pulled them off the microtubule and back into the centre of the trap. This did not occur when a bead was bound by an AMP.PNP-induced rigor linkage, or when beads were propelled by several kinesin molecules. Our results are consistent with a model in which kinesin detaches briefly from the microtubule during a part of each mechanochemical cycle, rather than a model in which kinesin remains bound at all times.\r"

Respiratory viruses were detected using virus isolation and virus antigen detection in nasopharyngeal specimens of 42% of the patients at the time of diagnosis. Rhinovirus (24%) and respiratory syncytial virus (13%) were the two most common viruses detected. Adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43 were found less frequently. The mean duration of preceding symptoms was 5.9 days before the diagnosis of acute otitis media. Ninety-four percent of the children had symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Fever was reported in 55% and earache in 47% of cases. Patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection had fever, cough, and vomiting significantly more often than patients with rhinovirus infection or virus-negative patients. No significant differences were found in the appearance of the tympanic membrane and outcome of illness between virus-negative and virus-positive patients with acute otitis. Most patients respond well to antimicrobial therapy despite the coexisting viral infection. If the symptoms of infection persist, they can be due to the underlying viral infection, and viral diagnostics preferably with rapid methods may be clinically useful in these patients.\r"

In this investigation an American Telephone and Telegraph StarSet-1 3000-ohm self-actuating microphone connected to the end of an infant cannula was used to monitor neonatal nasal airflow to detect breaths and apnea. The microphone was placed in a soundproof container to eliminate environmental sound artifacts. Analyses of 100 breaths from five patient samples during active and quiet sleep showed that there was no significant difference between microphone and expired CO2 recording of respiration. The techniques were 98% and 96% sensitive, respectively. Microphonic detection of nasal airflow identified 27 of the 32 episodes of upper airway obstruction (84.2%) registered by end-tidal CO2 recording. Inspiratory and expiratory events could also be well documented. Microphonic recording of nasal airflow is a reliable and inexpensive technique to detect apnea.\r"

  ".W": "Currently available human immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous use (IVIGs) are being used (with antibiotics) by some physicians for therapy of sepsis in newborns. Most neonatal sepsis and/or meningitis in this country is caused by group B Streptococcus (GBS), and most of these cases are due to type III GBS (III-GBS). The killing of III-GBS in vitro is dependent on specific IgG antibody. Adequate serum levels of specific III-GBS antibody protect the exposed newborn from the development of invasive disease. Therefore, III-GBS was used as a model to evaluate the activity of three IVIG preparations available for clinical use. Specific antibody levels, in vitro opsonophagocytic killing, and protective efficacy in animal models revealed differences in activity for III-GBS between the three IVIG preparations as well as between IVIG lots from the same manufacturer. Furthermore, it was found that the effect of IVIG using one of the assay methods may not reliably predict activity obtained using the other assays. These data document the inability to predict functional activity against a specific pathogen such as GBS on the part of a lot of IVIG chosen at random. In view of these findings and of the limited data evaluating clinical efficacy, IVIG cannot be recommended at this time for use in the therapy of infectious diseases such as neonatal sepsis.\r"

At less than 0.4 M NaCl, Ms. thermophila accumulated glutamate in response to increasing osmotic stress. At greater than 0.4 M NaCl, this organism synthesized a modified beta-amino acid that was identified as N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine by NMR spectroscopy and ion-exchange HPLC. This beta-amino acid derivative accumulated to high intracellular concentrations (up to 0.6 M) in Ms. thermophila and in another methanogen examined--Methanogenium cariaci, a marine species. The compound has features that are characteristic of a compatible solute: it is neutrally charged at physiological pH and it is highly soluble. When the cells were grown in the presence of exogenous glycine betaine, a physiological compatible solute, N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine synthesis was repressed and glycine betaine was accumulated. N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine was synthesized by species from three phylogenetic families when grown in high solute concentrations, suggesting that it may be ubiquitous among the methanogens. The ability to control the biosynthesis of N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine in response to extracellular solute concentration indicates that the methanogenic archaebacteria have a unique beta-amino acid biosynthetic pathway that is osmotically regulated.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously described the isolation of several genes expressed exclusively in the nervous system of adult Xenopus laevis and activated in the embryo shortly after neural induction. The sequence of one of these cDNAs, 24-15, identifies the corresponding protein as an isotype of the beta subunit of Na+,K(+)-ATPase [ATP phosphohydrolase (Na+/K(+)-transporting); EC 3.6.1.37]. This form is distinct from the previously described beta 1 subunit of Xenopus, and the protein sequence comparison suggests that it is not the frog homolog of the mammalian beta 2 subunit; therefore, we refer to the 24-15 protein as the beta 3 subunit of Na+,K(+)-ATPase of Xenopus. Antisera directed against beta 3-subunit fusion protein detected a protein in adult brain extracts with the size and properties expected for a Na+,K(+)-ATPase beta subunit. In Xenopus the beta 1 and beta 3 subunits are expressed as maternal mRNAs at similar levels; during embryogenesis rapid accumulation of beta 3 mRNA begins at stage 14 (early neurula), and the rapid accumulation of beta 1 mRNA begins at stage 23/24. In situ hybridization of antisense RNA probes to tadpole brain sections indicates that beta 3 subunit is expressed throughout the developing brain. We suggest that beta 3 is a major Na+,K(+)-ATPase beta subunit present during early nervous system development in the frog.\r"

  ".W": "Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are integral to the signal transduction pathways that mediate the cell's response to many hormones, neuromodulators, and a variety of other ligands. While many signaling processes are guanine nucleotide dependent, the precise coupling between a variety of receptors, G proteins, and effectors remains obscure. We found that the family of genes that encode the alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins is much larger than had previously been supposed. These novel alpha subunits could account for some of the diverse activities attributed to G proteins. We have now obtained cDNA clones encoding two murine alpha subunits, G alpha q and G alpha 11, that are 88% identical. They lack the site that is ordinarily modified by pertussis toxin and their sequences vary from the canonical Gly-Ala-Gly-Glu-Ser (GAGES) amino acid sequence found in most other G protein alpha subunits. Multiple mRNAs as large as 7.5 kilobases hybridize to G alpha q specific probes and are expressed at various levels in many different tissues. G alpha 11 is encoded by a single 4.0-kilobase message which is expressed ubiquitously. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that G alpha q and G alpha 11 represent a third class of alpha subunits. A member of this class was found in Drosophila melanogaster. This alpha subunit, DG alpha q, is 76% identical to G alpha q. The presence of the Gq class in both vertebrates and invertebrates points to a role that is central to signal transduction in multicellular organisms. We suggest that these alpha subunits may be involved in pertussis toxin-insensitive pathways coupled to phospholipase C.\r"

Cloning and sequencing of this element from D. funebris revealed the existence of the two open reading frames highly similar to those of jockey from D. melanogaster. Elements from both species are transcriptionally active and contain in their promoter regions a conserved sequence important for its activity. The high degree of similarity between the D. melanogaster and the D. funebris jockey and the absence of jockey from other sibling species of the D. funebris group provide evidence for the horizontal transmission of jockey into D. funebris.\r"

  ".W": "The sporulation operon spoIIA of Bacillus subtilis consists of three cistrons called spoIIAA, spoIIAB, and spoIIAC. Little is known about the function of spoIIAA and spoIIAB, but spoIIAC encodes a sigma factor called sigma F, which is capable of directing the transcription in vitro of genes that are expressed in the forespore chamber of the developing sporangium. We now report that the products of the spoIIA operon constitute a regulatory system in which SpoIIAA is an antagonist of SpoIIAB (or otherwise counteracts the effect of SpoIIAB) and SpoIIAB is, in turn, an antagonist of SpoIIAC (sigma F). This conclusion is based on the observations that (i) overexpression of spoIIAB inhibits sigma F-directed gene expression, (ii) a mutation in spoIIAB stimulates sigma F-directed gene expression, (iii) a mutation in spoIIAA blocks sigma F-directed gene expression, and (iv) a mutation in spoIIAB relieves the block in sigma F-directed gene expression caused by a mutation in spoIIAA. The SpoIIAA/SpoIIAB/SpoIIAC regulatory system could play a role in controlling the timing of sigma F-directed gene expression and/or could be responsible for restricting sigma F-directed gene expression to the forespore chamber of the sporangium.\r"

The 52-mer sequence contains the X and Y box elements conserved in all class II genes; their presence is indispensable for IFN-gamma inducibility. Furthermore, an additional 5 bp immediately 5' of the X box of the DPA gene are necessary and sufficient for IFN-gamma induction. This region may contain an IFN-gamma response element. A closely related sequence has also been found in the vicinity of the critical deletion sites of three other well-studied class II gene promoters, all of which require a much longer sequence 5' of the X box. A fourth element, the W element, located about 15 bp 5' of the X box in all class II genes, is clearly of little importance in IFN-gamma inducibility of the DPA gene.\r"

  ".W": "Proliferation and immunologic function of T lymphocytes are initiated by signals from the antigen receptor that are inhibited by the immunosuppressant FK506 but not by its structural analog, rapamycin. On the other hand, interleukin 2 (IL-2)-induced signals are blocked by rapamycin but not by FK506. Remarkably, these two drugs inhibit each other's actions, raising the possibility that both act by means of a common immunophilin (immunosuppressant binding protein). We find that the dissociation constant of rapamycin to the FK506 binding protein FKBP (Kd = 0.2 nM) is close to the dissociation constant of FK506 to FKBP (Kd = 0.4 nM) and to their effective biologic inhibitory concentrations. However, an excess of rapamycin is needed to revert FK506-mediated inhibition of IL-2 production, apoptosis, and transcriptional activation of NF-AT, a T-cell-specific transcription factor necessary for IL-2 gene activation. Similarly, an excess of FK506 is needed to revert rapamycin-mediated inhibition of IL-2-induced proliferation. The drug concentrations required for antagonism may be explained by the relative affinity of the drugs to, and by the abundance of, the immunophilin FKBP. FKBP has been shown to catalyze the interconversion of the cis- and trans-rotamers of the peptidyl-prolyl amide bond of peptide substrates; here we show that rapamycin, like FK506, is a potent inhibitor of the rotamase activity of FKBP (Ki = 0.2 nM). Neither FKBP binding nor inhibition of rotamase activity of FKBP alone is sufficient to explain the biologic actions of these drugs. Rather, these findings suggest that immunophilin bound to FK506 interferes with antigen receptor-induced signals, while rapamycin bound to the immunophilin interferes with IL-2-induced signals.\r"

These phosphorylations can be regulated by a number of protein-tyrosine kinases (ATP: protein-tyrosine O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.112) and protein-tyrosine-phosphatases (protein-tyrosine-phosphate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.48). In this study, we demonstrate that phenylarsine oxide can inhibit tyrosine phosphatases while leaving tyrosine kinase function intact. We use this reagent to investigate the effect of tyrosine phosphatase inhibition in a murine T-cell hybridoma. Increasing concentrations of phenylarsine oxide result in an increase in tyrosine phosphate on a number of intracellular substrates in unstimulated T cells, suggesting that a protein-tyrosine kinase is constitutively active in these cells. The effect of phenylarsine oxide on T cells stimulated with an anti-Thy 1 monoclonal antibody is more complex. At low concentrations of drug, there is a synergistic increase in the level of tyrosine phosphate on certain cellular substrates. At higher concentrations, anti-Thy 1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited. These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells is tightly regulated by tyrosine phosphatases. Partial inhibition of these enzymes results in enhanced substrate phosphorylation. Inhibition of all stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation by high doses of phenylarsine oxide suggests that tyrosine kinase activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphatases.\r"

Immunocytochemical studies on the subcellular localization of 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in the Purkinje cells from two laboratories have given contradictory results regarding the nuclear location of this receptor. In this paper, a high-affinity inositol 1,4,5-[32P]trisphosphate binding site (Kd = 0.11 nM) on nuclei isolated from rat liver and devoid of any microsomal, mitochondrial, or plasma membrane constituents is documented. Furthermore, we present data demonstrating that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is capable of releasing 45Ca2+ from the intact isolated liver nuclei. A rapid and transient release of calcium that was taken up by nuclei in the presence of ATP is observed. The role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the coupling between cytoplasmic second messengers and nuclear events activated during signal transduction is postulated.\r"

Recent findings suggest that cellular RNA may be a therapeutically relevant locus. At micromolar concentrations, Fe(II)-bleomycin readily cleaved a Bacillus subtilis tRNAHis precursor in a highly selective fashion, but Escherichia coli tRNA(Tyr) precursor was largely unaffected even under more forcing conditions. Other substrates included an RNA transcript encoding a large segment of the reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus 1. RNA cleavage was oxidative, approximately 10-fold more selective than DNA cleavage, and largely unaffected by nonsubstrate RNAs. RNA sequence analysis suggested recognition of RNA tertiary structure, rather than recognition of specific sequences; subsets of nucleotides at the junction of single- and double-stranded regions were especially susceptible to cleavage. The ready accessibility of cellular RNAs to xenobiotic agents, the high selectivity of bleomycin action on RNAs, and the paucity of mechanisms for RNA repair suggest that RNA may be a therapeutically relevant target for bleomycin.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing attention has focused on the role of free radicals derived from oxygen in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disorders. One of the well-recognized targets of free radical-induced injury is peroxidation of lipids. Using a variety of approaches, we have found that a series of prostaglandin F2-like compounds are produced in vivo in humans by a non-cyclooxygenase mechanism involving free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Levels of these compounds in normal human plasma and urine range from 5 to 40 pg/ml and 500 to 4000 pg/mg of creatinine, respectively. In rats, their formation was found to increase as much as 200-fold in association with marked free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation induced by administration of CCl4 and diquat. To explore whether these prostanoids can exert biological activity, the effects of one of the compounds formed by this mechanism, 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha, was examined in the kidney in the rat. Infusion of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha into a peripheral vein (5 micrograms/kg per min) or intrarenally (0.5-2.0 micrograms/kg per min) resulted in marked parallel reductions in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. That the formation of these prostanoids is catalyzed by free radicals and that they can exert potent biological activity suggest that these prostanoids may participate as pathophysiological mediators in oxidant injury. Quantification of these compounds may also provide a noninvasive approach to assess oxidant status in humans. That the formation of these prostanoids occurs independent of the catalytic activity of the cyclooxygenase enzyme suggests that there may be limitations at times regarding the reliability of the use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors to assess the role of prostaglandins in certain pathophysiological processes.\r"

The shorter transcript is sufficient to complement the spo13-1 mutation and contains a major open reading frame encoding a highly basic protein of 33.4 kilodaltons. A fragment upstream (-170 to -8) of the open reading frame confers meiosis-specific transcription on a spo13-HIS3 fusion. Deletions at the 5' end of spo13-lacZ fusions define a region between -140 and -80 that is essential for meiosis-specific expression. This region acts in an orientation-independent manner and is responsive to the MAT-RME regulatory cascade. It contains a 10-base-pair sequence, TAGCCGCCGA, found in a number of meiosis-specific genes, that appears to be required for SPO13 expression. This sequence is identical to URS1, a ubiquitous mitotic repressor element.\r"

We showed by sequencing that the rearranged variable region genes in these early B-cell progenitors were not different from the germ-line V lambda  1 gene (the single functional light chain variable region gene in chickens). In the bursal B lymphocytes, on the other hand, clear gene conversion events were first observed at day 15 of embryonic development. The present data indicate that rearrangement of light chain genes in the chicken occurs independently of the bursa of Fabricius and that diversification of the variable region begins only later, when the surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells are proliferating in the bursal follicles.\r"

The evaluations were done every 12 weeks during pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum to rule out new or occult invasive cervical cancer. By the time the postpartum biopsy was done, no such cancer had been detected. All 55 patients had mild dysplasia or less. I conclude that pregnant patients with biopsy-proven mild cervical dysplasia who have had adequate expert colposcopy and results of Pap test consistent with biopsy require only one antepartum colposcopy prior to postpartum reevaluation and treatment. Multiple interval cytologic and colposcopic studies with or without biopsy are unnecessary. The likelihood of invasive cervical cancer developing in these patients during pregnancy is negligible.\r"

Patients with malignancy had a significantly higher morbidity and 60-day mortality than the neurologically impaired. We concluded that patients should be carefully selected for PEG because early mortality is high; a 60-day trial of soft nasogastric feedings should be considered before PEG, and could reduce by nearly half the number of patients failing to receive long-term benefit; and patients with malignancy have significantly greater morbidity and mortality after PEG and may not receive the same advantage from the procedure.\r"

All but one patient were of Mongolian origin, and males were affected four times more commonly than females. Diabetes mellitus was present in 16%. There was a significant association between ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and calcification of other cervical paraspinal ligaments. It is suggested that a generalized tendency to calcification may be an important etiological factor in ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Four of the patients required surgery, and in our experience, anterior spinal fusion with removal of the ossified ligament or multilevel laminoplasty gives satisfactory results.\r"

To evaluate whether angiographically determined reperfusion could be predicted from changes in ST-segment elevation, the sum of ST-segment elevation in affected leads of the electrocardiogram was compared before and after thrombolytic therapy in 53 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Reperfusion status of the infarct-related artery was determined angiographically less than 8 hours from onset of symptoms. According to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial (TIMI) criteria, 33 patients had successful reperfusion (TIMI grade 2 to 3 flow) after thrombolytic therapy and 20 patients did not (TIMI grade 0 to 1 flow). Logistic multiple regression analysis showed that the proportional value for the shift in the sum of ST elevation, termed the \"% ST change,\" was more strongly associated with reperfusion than the absolute measured difference in millimeters (chi-square = 11.34 vs 9.22). The entire spectra of sensitivities and specificities were determined to identify a level of the percent ST change with simultaneous high sensitivity and specificity. A 20% decrease in ST elevation provided such a level (88% sensitivity, 80% specificity). The positive and negative predictive values of a 20% decrease in ST elevation were 88 and 80%, respectively. These results suggest that a decrease of only 20% in the sum of ST elevation in the standard electrocardiogram after thrombolytic therapy is a useful noninvasive predictor of reperfusion status in patients with evolving AMI.\r"

The contribution of heparin to efficacy and safety after thrombolysis with rt-PA is unknown. In this pilot study, 84 patients were treated within 6 hours of onset of acute myocardial infarction (mean of 2.7 hours) with the standard dose of 100 mg of rt-PA over 3 hours. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive additionally immediate intravenous heparin anticoagulation (5,000 U of intravenous bolus followed by 1,000 U/hour titrated to a partial thromboplastin time of 1.5 to 2.0 times control) while 42 patients received rt-PA alone. Coronary angiography performed on day 3 (48 to 72 hours, mean 57) after rt-PA therapy revealed infarct artery patency rates of 71 and 43% in anticoagulated and control patients, respectively (p = 0.015). Recurrent ischemia or infarction, or both, occurred in 3 (7.1%) anticoagulated patients and 5 (11.9%) control patients (difference not significant). Mild, moderate and severe bleeding occurred in 52, 10 and 2% of the group receiving anticoagulation, respectively, and 34, 2 and 0% of patients in the control group, respectively (p = 0.006). These data indicate that after rt-PA therapy of acute myocardial infarction, heparin therapy is associated with substantially higher coronary patency rates 3 days after thrombolysis but is accompanied by an increased incidence of minor bleeding complications.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the clinical incidence and outcomes of patients with pericarditis after thrombolytic therapy, 810 patients were prospectively studied during acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Pericarditis was defined as the presence of a pericardial friction rub during the hospital course. Only 5% of patients developed a rub during AMI, a low percent compared with that in the prethrombolytic era. A pericardial friction rub more often occurred in the setting of an anterior wall AMI. Patients with, compared to those without, a pericardial friction rub had lower ejection fractions (45 vs 51%, p = 0.002); worse regional left ventricular function (-3.2 vs 2.7, standard deviation per chord); higher in-hospital mortality (15 vs 6%, p = 0.056); a higher frequency of power failure (83 vs 57%); a higher frequency of anterior wall location of the AMI (53% of cases, p = 0.002); and a higher frequency of 3-vessel disease. Therefore, although the frequency of a pericardial friction rub was low (5%) compared with that in the prethrombolytic era, its occurrence denotes more extensive myocardial damage with a worse clinical outcome. Perhaps with successful reperfusion of the infarct-related vessel, transmural myocardial necrosis is prevented and with it the development of pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade did not occur clinically in any patient who developed a pericardial friction rub.\r"

Ninety-three healthy subjects acted as controls. Serum trace element levels were considered in relation to vitamin A and E levels, nutritional parameters, the activity of the disease, and the recent intake of steroids. The effect of total enteral nutrition on serum trace elements was studied in seven cases. Serum zinc levels were lower and serum copper levels higher in the active colitis group than in controls (p = 0.0007, and p = 0.02, respectively). More than 50% of patients with active colonic or small bowel disease showed zinc levels below the 15th percentile of the control group. Serum zinc levels correlated with plasma vitamin A in acute colitis (r = 0.67; p = 0.006), and with both serum albumin concentration (r = 0.76; p = 0.002) and disease activity score (r = -0.67, p = 0.009) in patients with small bowel disease. The copper:zinc ratio was higher in the active colitis group than in controls (p = 0.002). In spite of the increase in serum albumin levels and the decrease in disease activity, serum zinc levels remained low after total enteral nutrition. The implications of the abnormal trace element status in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To investigate the combined usefulness of CD4 lymphocyte counts and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen in predicting progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: CD4 lymphocyte counts and HIV-1 p24 antigen status were evaluated over a 4-year period in 518 HIV-1-seropositive men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study in Chicago. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent (134 of 518) of the HIV-1-seropositive cohort had detectable p24 antigen during the study period. Men with p24 antigenemia experienced a more rapid decline in CD4 lymphocyte counts than men who were persistently p24 antigen-negative (p less than 0.01). Mean CD4 lymphocyte counts at first detection of p24 antigen were 406 and 455 cells/microL for men with incident and prevalent antigenemia, respectively. Antigen was detected in 61% (63 of 103) of the men who progressed to AIDS and in only 17% (71 of 415) of the men who did not (p less than 0.0001). The 4-year estimated cumulative AIDS incidence was 86%, 63%, and 21% for men with entry CD4 counts less than 200, 200 to 399, and 400 or more cells/microL, respectively. Presence of p24 antigenemia was strongly associated with more rapid disease progression within each of these CD4 groupings (p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that p24 antigenemia can first be detected with moderate CD4 cell depletion, is associated with a more rapid decline in the CD4 lymphocyte population, and combined with CD4 lymphocyte counts is useful in identifying individuals at significantly greater risk of disease progression. Our findings provide important information for assessing HIV-1 disease prognosis over a 4-year period.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: In order to assess the relation of thyroid function tests to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we determined the levels of serum thyroid hormones, serum binding proteins [thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)], and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in HIV-seropositive subjects at different clinical stages. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven HIV-seropositive patients were studied: 7 at stage II, 13 at stage III, and 17 at stage IV (eight ambulatory and nine hospitalized) according to the Centers for Disease Control's criteria. RESULTS: As compared with stage II and stage III patients, stage IV patients had significantly higher mean TBG and total thyroxine (TT4) values, similar and normal total triiodothyronine (TT3) levels, and similar and abnormally low reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) concentrations. However, stage IV hospitalized patients had significantly lower TT3 values than stage IV ambulatory patients. In contrast to TBG, mean levels of CBG and SHBG were comparable in the three groups and within normal limits. For the whole population of HIV patients, there was a highly significant correlation between the CD4 lymphocyte count and TBG (r = -0.529, p less than 0.001) but not with CBG and SHBG levels. Finally, TNF values higher than 10 pg/mL were detected in six of the 17 stage IV patients and in only one of the 13 stage III patients (p = 0.059); elevated TNF levels correlated with a lower CD4 count (p less than 0.01) but not with serum TBG levels. CONCLUSION: The progression of HIV infection is associated with an elevation of serum TNF and TBG, but not of CBG or SHBG. HIV-infected patients have an unexpectedly normal TT3-low rT3 state.\r"

This analysis assesses the determinants of successful aging--whether or not an individual will live to an advanced age, continue to function well at home, and remain mentally alert. Over 100 separate indicators of demographic and socio-economic status, social supports, health and mental status in 1971 were available as potential predictors of successful aging. Indicators of access to health care over the period 1970-82 and indicators of diseases over this period were also available as predictors. Those who aged successfully were shown to have greater satisfaction with life in 1983 and to have made fewer demands on the health care system than those who aged less well. Despite the large number of potential predictors of successful aging which were examined, only age, four measures of health status, two measures of mental status, and not having one's spouse die or enter a nursing home were shown to be predictive of successful aging.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that PAF partially mediates endotoxin-induced lung dysfunction, we studied the effects of two structurally dissimilar PAF receptor antagonists (SRI 63-441 and WEB 2086) on endotoxin-induced lung dysfunction in chronically instrumented awake sheep. Each animal was studied three times in varied order: infusion of endotoxin alone (Escherichia coli endotoxin 0.5 micrograms/kg over 20 min [E]), infusion of the competitive platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist alone, or with endotoxin given 1 h after beginning the 6-h drug infusion (E + SRI, E + WEB). Neither drug alone had significant effects on any of the measured variables, but both were able to abolish the pulmonary pressor effect of a 0.25-micrograms/kg bolus of PAF. SRI 63-441 (10 to 20 mg/kg/h) attenuated the endotoxin-induced pulmonary hypertension (peak pulmonary arterial pressure, 53 +/- 12 versus 65 +/- 7 cm H2O; p greater than 0.05) and fall in dynamic compliance of the lungs (to 65.1 +/- 9.8% baseline versus 32.6 +/- 5.1% baseline). Lung lymph flow increased 6.1- and 5.8-fold at 2 and 5 h for (E) versus 1.9- and 2.5-fold at identical time points for (E + SRI). SRI 63-441 attenuated the acute leukopenia noted after endotoxemia. WEB 2086 (20 mg/kg/h) similarly attenuated the late alterations in lung mechanics and lymph flow caused by endotoxin, but it had little effect on the early pulmonary hypertension and lung mechanic changes. Both agents significantly attenuated the rise in lymph thromboxane B2 levels after endotoxemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A community-based tuberculosis case-finding and short-course chemotherapy program was conducted in a suburb of Manila and featured 1 month of daily isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), and pyrazinamide (PZA) followed by 7 months of twice-weekly, high dose, directly observed INH + EMB + PZA. Church-affiliated lay workers obtained 1,990 sputum specimens from subjects who complained of chronic cough or wasting symptoms; 207 of the specimens were positive on Ziehl-Neelsen smears. On culture, 176 yielded a significant growth of M. tuberculosis. Of these 176 patients, 144 were selected to enter the study; 10 were lost because of withdrawal or death and four (2.7%) because of drug toxicity. This left 130 patients who were followed long-term. Remarkably, 80% (104) were initially shedding drug-resistant organisms; 26% (34) were resistant to one drug, 30% (40) were resistant to two drugs, and 24% (30) were resistant to three or more drugs. Responses to therapy corresponded closely to the extent of drug resistance: 80% (48 of 60) of patients with drug-susceptible or single resistance had a favorable outcome; 43% (28 of 65) were resistant to two or three drugs, and 0% (0 of 5) of those were resistant to four or more drugs. Notable findings of this study were the success of a community-based program in conducting prolonged, directly observed treatment, the unexpectedly high prevalence of multiple-drug-resistant organisms in this population, and the inadequacy of INH + PZA + EMB during the continuation phase of therapy in this setting.\r"

  ".W": "Human alveolar macrophages (HAM) from 28 normal volunteers were found to inhibit replication of Cryptococcus neoformans. Conditions under which fungistasis occurred were different than those required for mouse peritoneal macrophage-mediated fungistasis. Inhibition of fungal replication by mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) requires that the macrophages are activated and that the cocultures of C. neoformans and macrophages be done in the presence of serum, L-arginine, and endotoxin. During MPM-mediated fungistasis and tumor cell killing, L-arginine is oxidized to NO2-, NO3-, and L-citrulline. In addition, MPM have arginase activity that converts L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. HAM-mediated fungistasis was similar to that mediated by MPM in terms of the serum requirement, but HAM did not require L-arginine or endotoxin. HAM did not produce NO2- or NO3- detectable by colorimetric and bioassay, nor did HAM produce L-citrulline or L-ornithine from 14C-radiolabeled L-arginine as detectable by reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC of macrophage-C. neoformans coculture supernatants. HAM had no detectable arginase activity, hence there was no evidence for L-arginine nitrogen metabolism in HAM. HAM-mediated fungistasis was not enhanced by endotoxin or by recombinant human interferon-gamma (rHIFN-gamma). The combination of endotoxin and rHIFN-gamma inhibited the fungistatic effect of HAM. Human peritoneal macrophages (HPM) from women undergoing laparoscopy were tested for fungistasis and L-arginine nitrogen oxidation. Partial inhibition of cryptococcal replication occurred; however, there was no evidence of L-arginine metabolism to NO2- or NO3-.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because these effects may have therapeutic relevance to asthma, we examined the activity of the active L-enantiomer of cromakalim, BRL 38227 (lemakalim), a selective K+ channel activator, against a variety of spasmogens in human bronchi in vitro. BRL 38227 produced relaxation of bronchi with either resting tone or tone induced by histamine, carbachol, neurokinin A, or KCl (20 mM) with an efficacy (%Emax) of 60 to 80% of that of isoproterenol and an EC50 (the concentration producing 50% of the maximal response) of 0.2 to 0.6 microM. However, BRL 38227 had a significantly lower potency and efficacy against 80 mM KCl than against the other spasmogens (%Emax, 12% of isoproterenol and EC50, 7.2 microM; p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.001, respectively), supporting the view that BRL 38227 acts on K+ channels. The D-enantiomer BRL 38226 was less potent (EC50, 2.6 microM) than BRL 38227 and produced only 43% of the isoproterenol relaxation. BRL 38227-induced relaxation was significantly inhibited by the ATP-sensitive K+ channel antagonist glibenclamide (0.1 and 1 microM), with a three-fold and eight-fold shift to the right of the dose-response curve, respectively. In the presence of a maximal relaxation induced by the calcium voltage-dependent channel antagonist verapamil, BRL 38227 was able to produce an additional 37% relaxation response. Thus, BRL 38227 is an effective relaxant of human airway smooth muscle, and this activity results from an action at K+ channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Using positron emission tomography (PET), we studied regional striatal 18F-dopa uptake in 16 patients with L-dopa-responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), 18 patients with multiple system atrophy, and 10 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. Results were compared with those of 30 age-matched normal volunteers. The patients with PD showed significantly reduced mean uptake of 18F-dopa in the caudate and putamen compared to controls, but while function in the posterior part of the putamen was severely impaired (45% of normal), function in the anterior part of the putamen and in the caudate was relatively spared (62% and 84% of normal). Mean 18F-dopa uptake in the posterior putamen was depressed to similar levels in all patients. Unlike patients with PD, the patients with progressive supranuclear palsy showed equally severe impairment of mean 18F-dopa uptake in the anterior and posterior putamen. Caudate 18F-dopa uptake was also significantly lower in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy than in patients with PD, being depressed to the same level as that in the putamen. Mean 18F-dopa uptake values in the anterior putamen and caudate in patients with multiple system atrophy lay between PD and progressive supranuclear palsy levels. Locomotor disability of individual patients with PD or multiple system atrophy correlated with decline in striatal 18F-dopa uptake, but this was not the case for the patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We conclude that patients with PD have selective nigral pathological features with relative preservation of the dopaminergic function in the anterior putamen and caudate, whereas there is progressively more extensive nigral involvement in multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To study a relationship between the histologic distribution of GAGs and the morphologic pattern of salivary gland tumors, we carried out immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses of GAGs on 16 cases of PA and three cases of ACC. Immunohistochemically, several GAG fractions such as chondroitin-6-sulfate, unsulfated chondroitin sulfate, and keratan sulfate were seen mainly at the plasma membrane of both PA and ACC cells and of myoepithelial cells of normal salivary glands. Most of these GAG-positive cells were distributed in solid and chondromyxoid parts of PA and in the cellular part of ACC. Biochemical GAG analysis of both PA and ACC, separated into nonsulfated and sulfated fractions by two-dimensional electrophoresis, revealed high concentrations of chondroitin sulfate in both neoplasms, but the concentration of hyaluronic acid, was significantly higher in PA than in ACC. The results show that the concentration of hyaluronic acid, a major nonsulfated GAG fraction, was significantly higher in PA than in ACC and, therefore, this difference may be useful in the differentiation of the two neoplasms.\r"

These latter reactions were abolished when the RBCs were pretreated with the proteolytic enzyme ficin suggesting an interaction with sialoglycoproteins. In this study we show that prior addition of vancomycin did not block binding of antibodies to several blood group antigens, nor does vancomycin precipitate in an Ouchterlony assay with any of several sialic acid moieties. Finally, we show that vancomycin possesses fluorescent properties but fails to be detected on the RBC surface by flow cytometry. These data indicate that vancomycin may be acting through its polycationic properties. Our findings do not support protein binding of vancomycin to the RBC surface, but underline the importance of the zeta potential in RBC serologic reactions.\r"

  ".W": "A group of healthy control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease were investigated using positron emission tomography and two tracers as indicators of different specific properties of the presynaptic dopaminergic system in caudate nucleus and putamen. The first tracer, 6-L-(18F)-fluorodopa, was used as an analog of levodopa to assess its regional brain uptake, conversion into, and retention as dopamine and further metabolites. The second tracer, (11C)-nomifensine was employed as an indicator of striatal monaminergic reuptake sites that are principally dopaminergic. We have used this tracer to assess dopaminergic nerve terminal density. In patients with Parkinson's disease, striatal uptake of both tracers was decreased, putamen being significantly more affected than caudate. Side-to-side differences of uptake in putamen, but not caudate, correlated with corresponding left-right differences of scored clinical motor performance. Both 6-L(18F)-fluorodopa and (11C)-nomifensine tracer uptake in putamen was decreased on average to 40% of normal values, suggesting that a substantial part of the cellular elements of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system is still intact in living parkinsonian patients. This is in contrast to the generally extreme depletion of endogenous dopamine in the putamen of patients found at postmortem. Our results lend support to the search for drug treatments that protect against further nigrostriatal cell loss and that could be exhibited as soon as the disease manifests clinically. If successful, a sufficient striatal nerve terminal pool would remain so that the effectiveness of levodopa as a dopamine repletor could persist.\r"
