After eating a radiolabelled test meal consisting of mixed liquid and solids, duodenal myoelectric activity and gastrointestinal transit of the meal were determined simultaneously. In spite of considerable variation in entire gastric emptying time between subjects (range 2.5-5.0 hours), significant correlation was found between the completion of gastric emptying and the resumption of duodenal phase III activity within subjects (p less than 0.01).

  ".W": "The effect of volume expansion of extracellular fluid on gastroduodenal resistance to the flow of isotonic saline was assessed in three groups of rats using intravenous infusions of isotonic, isotonic-isoncotic, and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions. The gastroduodenal segment of 29 male Wistar rats was barostatically perfused at a constant pressure gradient of 4 cm H2O and changes in flow (ml/minute) were taken as a reflection of changes in gastroduodenal resistance. Isotonic expansion led to a 33% drop in gastroduodenal flow compared with the normovolaemic period in the same animals (p less than 0.01). Extracellular fluid expansion with isotonic-isoncotic and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions was associated with reductions in gastroduodenal flow of 29% (p less than 0.05) and 31% (p less than 0.01) respectively. The increase in gastroduodenal resistance is due to hypervolaemia per se and not to haemodilution, decreases in plasma oncotic pressure, or electrolyte imbalance. The effect of hypervolaemia on gastroduodenal resistance, which was reversed by small haemorrhages (0.5-1.0 ml per 100 g body weight), may be due to changes in tonus or phasic motor activity, or both, and may be part of the homeostatic processes that help the organism minimise liquid volume excess.\r"

Yersiniae attached to M cells are phagocytosed and transported from the lumen into the lamina propria. No invasion of columnar absorptive cells was observed.

Serum was collected from 79 patients with ulcerative colitis, 36 with Crohn's disease, 16 with specific diarrhoeal syndromes, and from 19 normal subjects. Twenty nine of 79 patients with ulcerative colitis, 21 of 36 with Crohn's disease, and all patients with diarrhoea were symptomatic during the collection of sera. The difference in optical density values between patients with symptomatic ulcerative colitis and each of the other groups, including patients with ulcerative colitis in remission, was highly significant (p less than 0.01). Seventy nine per cent of patients with symptomatic ulcerative colitis had optical density values above the means for all other groups. Fifty five per cent of sera from patients with symptomatic ulcerative colitis had optical densities beyond two SDs of the values for all other groups and only two of 71 sera from non-ulcerative colitis patients (one Crohn's disease and one normal subject) had values in this range. These results show the presence of anti-colon antibodies against the 40 kDa protein(s) in the sera of many patients with symptomatic ulcerative colitis.\r"

All subjects showed a pronounced fall in rectal blood flow in the first 30 minutes and patients with colitis had significantly higher values compared with smokers (p less than 0.002; p less than 0.04) and non-smokers (p less than 0.007; p less than 0.002) during the first and second 30 minutes respectively. Values in smokers and non-smokers were similar, but smoking a cigarette was associated with a significant fall in blood flow (p less than 0.04) and this change was inversely related to the rise in plasma nicotine concentration (r = -0.63; p less than 0.05). The findings may be relevant to the association between colitis and the smoking history.\r"

Compared with pretreatment values, after macroscopic healing, a significant reduction in daytime median percentage of reflux time (10.0 v 6.5; p less than 0.05) and median number of reflux episodes lasting more than 5 minutes (5-5 v 1.0; p less than 0.05) were observed, whereas during night time reflux frequency and severity did not change. During maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 or 300 mg nocte, five of the six patients, who had shown no improvement in gastro-oesophageal reflux after acute healing, relapsed. These results suggest that, in contrast with previous work, a decrease in gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux oesophagitis can be achieved after macroscopic healing, and that the occurrence of such a reduction after acute healing is predictive of a good response to longterm treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Decreased cell mediated cytotoxicity occurs frequently in inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in patients with active disease. It is not clear, however, whether this decrease is caused by the disease or is a consequence of the medical treatment. In this study we evaluated the effect of in vivo treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphasalazine on the in vitro natural killer cell activity in five patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission and in four healthy control subjects in a double blind randomised crossover trial preceded and separated by four weeks of treatment with placebo. The natural killer cell activity was significantly impaired in 67% (six of nine subjects) after four weeks' sulphasalazine treatment and tended to be related to subjects with a slow acetylator phenotype. In contrast, 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment caused only a marginal reaction in the natural killer cell activity in 22% (two of nine subjects). The inhibitory effects were found to be reversible since the decreased natural killer cell activity was completely restored after placebo treatment in all subjects. In conclusion, in vivo treatment with sulphasalazine inhibits the in vitro natural killer cell activity and this seems to be mediated by the sulphapyridine moiety. This phenomenon may contribute to the low natural killer cell activity found in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Serum concentrations of sIL-2R were significantly raised in patients with active Crohn's disease compared with patients with inactive disease (p less than 0.001) and control subjects. There was a significant correlation between serum sIL-2R concentrations and disease activity as assessed by the Harvey-Bradshaw index (r = 0.42, p less than 0.01), platelet numbers (r = 0.49, p less than 0.01), and orosomucoid (r = 0.47, p less than 0.01), alpha 1 antitrypsin (r = 0.44, p less than 0.01), and C reactive protein concentrations (r = 0.48, p less than 0.001) but not with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Measurement of serum sIL-2R concentration is a simple and useful laboratory means of assessing disease activity. Raised concentrations in patients with active Crohn's disease is further evidence for in vivo immune activation occurring in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports have shown that both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis affect people in white collar occupations associated with higher income and higher social class more frequently than other groups in the population. This study sought to carry these analyses one step further and investigate the distribution of inflammatory bowel disease by individual occupations. The German social security statistics for 'rehabilitation' were used to assess the occupational distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. From 1982 to 1988, a total of 12,014 people were granted rehabilitation as a result of inflammatory bowel disease. Low male prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease was found among bricklayers, road construction workers, unskilled workers in brick and stone, unskilled labourers, and security personnel. Low rates were found among women employed in cleaning and maintenance, and in those without occupation. In contrast, a high male prevalence was found among instrument makers, electricians, bakers, and technical assistants. Among female employees, inflammatory bowel disease was significantly associated with sales representatives, office workers, health occupations, and hairdressers. These associations were found in the complete data for 1982-8 as well as in the separate data for the two half periods 1982-5 and 1986-8. Highly significant correlations between the occupational distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were found among both male and female employees. It seems that occupations involving work in the open air and physical exercise are protective, while being exposed to air conditioned artificial working conditions or extended and irregular shift working confer a risk of contracting inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

  ".W": "The biochemical events that make colonic epithelial cells proceed along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence are not well understood. The phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. To determine its role in colonic neoplasias we performed mass measurements of its second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol in biopsy specimens from normal mucosa and neoplasias of the colon. Normal colonic mucosa was also investigated in patients without colonic abnormalities (n = 10). Compared with pooled diacylglycerol values from five colonic sites (100%), values in patients with a normal colon were highest in the ascending colon (120 (5)%, p less than 0.05) and lowest in the rectum (81 (5)%, p less than 0.01). Absolute diacylglycerol values in patients with normal colons (2.62 (0.16) nmol/mg protein) were not significantly different from those found in the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal neoplasias (2.45 (0.17) nmol/mg protein). Both colonic adenomas (n = 15) and colorectal carcinomas (n = 14) showed significantly decreased diacylglycerol values compared with the adjacent normal mucosa of each patient (72 (4)%, p less than 0.001, and 71 (4)%, p less than 0.001 respectively). The appreciable decrease in mass diacylglycerol values clearly distinguishes adenomas and carcinomas of the colon from the surrounding normal mucosa. This finding suggests that profound metabolic changes of the phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway occur early in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and may be important in colonic carcinogenesis.\r"

Both at rest and during transmural stimulation the release of acetylcholine was significantly higher in the spastic (aganglionic) segment than in the proximal dilated bowel. Significant differences were found in the tissue concentration of acetylcholine between ganglionic and aganglionic specimens. The pattern of response to transmural stimulation was also different in the spastic and dilated bowel. Transmural stimulation induced relaxation and contraction in ganglionic specimens but only contractions in aganglionic specimens. The sensitivity of the smooth muscle in the aganglionic portion to exogenous acetylcholine and to field stimulation was found to be higher than in the ganglionic portion. While noradrenaline added to the organ bath reduced the stimulation-evoked release of acetylcholine from spastic segments, via an alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated process, yohimbine did not enhance the release. It is suggested that in Hirschsprung's disease the increased acetylcholine release, the enhanced sensitivity of smooth muscle cells to acetylcholine, and the lack of alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated noradrenergic modulation of acetylcholine release from cholinergic interneurons might be responsible for the spasm of aganglionic segments.\r"

Although conduction in the pudendo-anal reflex arc may be prolonged, and is so in neurogenic faecal incontinence, it must be shown to be present before the method can be used. This stimulation results in an immediate rise in the pressure in the anal canal and a significant increase in the electromyographic activity of the external anal sphincter. Maintenance of the stimulus over a two month period raised the mean resting pressure significantly in the anal canal and increased the reflex and voluntary responses of the external anal sphincter to coughing and squeezing actions respectively. The length of the sphincter was not affected. There was widening of the mean motor unit potential duration, though this was not significant. The resting electromyogram was enhanced after the course of treatment, indicating greater spontaneous activity in the external sphincter. The changes led to seven of the eight patients studied becoming continent at the end of the treatment.\r"

In both patients and normal subjects, the onset and duration of rectal sensation correlated closely with the external anal sphincter electrical activity (r = 0.8, p less than 0.0001) and with rectal contraction (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001), but not with internal sphincter relaxation. All normal subjects perceived a rectal sensation within one second of rapid inflation of a rectal balloon with volumes of 20 ml or less air. Six patients did not perceive any rectal sensation until 60 ml had been introduced, while in the remaining nine patients the sensation was delayed by at least two seconds. Internal sphincter relaxation occurred before the sensation was perceived in three of 27 normal subjects and 11 of 16 patients (p less than 0.001), and could be associated with anal leakage, which stopped as soon as sensation was perceived. The lowest rectal volumes required to induce anal relaxation, to cause sustained relaxation, or to elicit sensations of a desire to defecate or pain were similar in patients and normal subjects. In conclusion, these results show the close association between rectal sensation and external anal sphincter contraction, and show that faecal incontinence may occur as a result of delayed or absent external anal sphincter contraction when the internal anal sphincter is relaxed.\r"

Intrasubject variation in maximum tolerable volume also occurred which was related to study order and progressively reduced with repeated study. In 26 unselected patients with pain predominant irritable bowel syndrome similar intersubject variation was noted and virtually all patients data fell within the calculated 95% confidence limits of the normal individuals. Differentiation between patients and normal subjects was not possible from knowledge of rectal responses. These noticeable inter- and intrasubject variations in rectal responses to distension need to be considered whenever similar techniques are proposed for use in the study of rectal disease or of rectal response to treatment.\r"

Seventy of the 107 patients have been grafted, with an overall one year actuarial survival of 62%. A better prognosis at the time of referral, as assessed by both serum bilirubin concentration and a mathematically derived prognostic index, was associated with a greater probability of survival after grafting. Patients in the tertile with the best prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration at referral 84 mumol/l and estimated survival in the absence of transplantation of more than nine months) had a 78% one year actuarial survival after transplantation, whereas those in the tertile with the worst prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration 467 mumol/l and estimated survival of less than four months) had a one year actuarial survival of only 50%. No trend towards earlier referral of patients, however, was shown using either of these two markers. This retrospective analysis suggests that many patients are being referred too late for an optimal outcome. We recommend that patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who are potential candidates for liver grafting should be referred to a transplant centre before the serum bilirubin concentration approaches 150 mumol/l.\r"

A total of 143 patients affected by Crohn's disease and 115 control subjects were studied. All had a Lundh meal test. As a group patients with Crohn's disease had significantly decreased activity of both amylase (p less than 0.02) and lipase (p less than 0.001) in duodenal aspirates. In patients with Crohn's disease enzyme activities were not correlated to duration of disease or to extent or localisation of previous bowel resection. The lowest enzyme values were found in patients with the most extensive bowel involvement, and they were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than in patients with disease confined to the terminal ileum. The differences between enzyme values in other subgroups of patients were not significant. For the patient group as a whole no correlation was found between disease activity and enzyme values, but for the most uniform group of patients, those with terminal ileitis, pancreatic function was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients with moderate and severe disease compared with patients with mild disease. Thus at least two factors seem to be responsible for impaired pancreatic function in Crohn's disease: firstly disease activity and secondly localisation or extent of disease.\r"

For the same reason, the 20 patients with Barrett's oesophagus also underwent 24 hour continuous oesophageal pH monitoring, and the results obtained were compared with those of 20 oesophagitis patients without Barrett's oesophagus (10 with mild oesophagitis and 10 with severe oesophagitis). The manometric results show that the motor changes found in the Barrett's group are specific but similar to the motor dysfunction associated with reflux oesophagitis. Motor anomalies are probably related more to the inflammatory process in the oesophageal wall than to the metaplastic changes themselves. The pH monitoring results show that while reflux in the Barrett's oesophagus patients was greater overall than in the oesophagitis group without Barrett's oesophagus, the changes are similar when the results are compared with the severe oesophagitis group. In conclusion there are other factors besides gastro-oesophageal reflux involved in the pathogenesis of Barrett's oesophagus.\r"

By eight weeks these values were 71% and 35% respectively; p less than 0.001. Histological assessments were available for 73% of the patients. At entry, 63% (66 of 104) in the omeprazole group and 60% (56 of 94) in the cimetidine group (ns) had abnormal histology. After the study, the proportions of patients who initially had had abnormal histology but who then progressed to normal were 67% (44 of 66: omeprazole) and 48% (27 of 56: cimetidine) respectively (p less than 0.001). All patients had reflux symptoms at entry. After four weeks, 46% in the omeprazole group and 22% (p less than 0.001) in the cimetidine group were asymptomatic. Diary cards completed for the first two weeks showed that patients treated with omeprazole experienced fewer reflux symptoms by day and night and used fewer antacids. Omeprazole, 20 mg once a day for four to eight weeks, healed a greater proportion of patients with reflux oesophagitis than cimetidine, 1.6 g per day, assessed endoscopically and histologically, and relieved more patients' symptoms.\r"

After treatment, 88% of 17 patients on cimetidine only remained H pylori positive, whereas combined administration of cimetidine and cefixime had suppressed H pylori in 78% of 18 patients (p less than 0.05). Seventeen patients in the former group whose ulcers healed but who remained H pylori positive and 18 patients in the latter group whose ulcers healed and who were no longer infected with H pylori continued to be followed after treatment. These patients underwent endoscopy to detect ulcer recurrence if symptomatic, or at 12 and 24 weeks if asymptomatic. At 12 weeks, recurrence was observed in seven of 15 (47%) patients in whom H pylori persisted, but in only one of 14 (7%) patients in whom H pylori had been suppressed (p less than 0.05). At 24 weeks, however, recurrence rates were similar between the two groups. These findings indicate that H pylori infection may be closely related to early ulcer recurrence.\r"

A consecutive series of 40 patients with an initial diagnosis of gastric epithelial dysplasia based on examination of endoscopic biopsies has been reviewed to determine the clinical outcome and to evaluate a two tier histological grading system as a predictor of the risk of cancer. On review, only 20 of the 40 patients were considered to have true dysplasia: seven patients had low grade dysplasia and 13 had high grade dysplasia. Of the 13 patients with high grade dysplasia, 11 (85%) were found to have gastric cancer within 15 months. Of the 10 patients with high grade dysplasia who underwent gastrectomy, six were found to have early gastric cancer, three had cancer invading into the muscularis propria, and none had lymph node metastases. High grade dysplasia is thus a marker of gastric cancer. Moreover, the cancers associated with high grade dysplasia are usually pathologically favourable and curable. The finding, by an experienced pathologist, of high grade dysplasia in two separate sets of endoscopic biopsies is therefore an indication for radical surgical treatment, provided that the patient's age and general condition permit such an approach.\r"

Thirty three patients were studied after Billroth II resection without vagotomy. Gastric electrical activity was recorded from surface electrodes and intraluminal pressure was recorded simultaneously. The electrogastrographic signals were analysed by Running Spectrum Analysis. In addition, three dogs with a Billroth II stomach and implanted serosal electrodes were studied. Phasic gastric pressure waves were observed in most patients. Electrogastrographic signals recorded from 82% of the Billroth II patients contained a mean (SD) peak at 3.1 (0.2) cycles per minute (cpm). Fasting and postprandial frequencies correlated significantly (p less than 0.02) with the score for nausea and vomiting. In 61% of the patients, the electrogastrographic signal contained a stable component with a frequency of 10.5 (0.6) cpm that was not caused by respiration. We suggest that this activity is of intestinal origin. In all three dogs studied, retrograde conduction of jejunal electrical control activity (16 cpm) into the distal part of the gastric remnant was observed. In the Billroth II patients, the presence of a 10 cpm component correlated negatively with symptoms.\r"

We therefore compared the current diet, smoking habits, social class, and possible other risk factors of 78 patients with duodenal ulcer and a community control group matched for age and sex. Logistic regression for matched sets was used to calculate the relative risks for successive quintiles of dietary fibre and sugar intake before and after adjustment for total calorie intake and for the possible confounding effect of other known risk factors. Relative risks did not differ materially or consistently for total dietary fibre or for the cereal moiety whether adjusted or not for calorie intake. By contrast, relative risks tended to be reduced with high vegetable fibre intake and with low refined sugar intake. After controlling for smoking and social class, both of which were associated with ulcer disease, and for relative weight (Quetelet's index), the relation between ulcer disease and low refined sugar intake persisted, while that with high vegetable fibre intake was reduced. The results of this study indicate that a lack of cereal or total fibre intake plays no part in duodenal ulcer development but that a low refined sugar intake may be a protective factor.\r"

The mean percentage of linoleic acid in adipose tissue was significantly lower in the ulcer group (10.0 (0.7) v 12.3 (0.7)%, p less than 0.01) and this difference was found in both smokers and non-smokers.

We compared colloidal bismuth subcitrate alone with CBS combined with one of four antibiotic regimens in the treatment of duodenal ulcers. Endoscopy and antral biopsies were performed before treatment and four weeks afterwards. Biopsy specimens were examined for histological evidence of gastritis and by Gram stain and culture for H pylori infection. Altogether 141 patients were allocated to one of five treatment groups. Giving CBS and metronidazole (400 mg tid for 7 days) with and without amoxycillin (500 mg tid) achieved higher clearance rates of H pylori than treatment with CBS alone (p less than 0.01). These two combinations also achieved higher rates of antral gastritis healing than CBS alone (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05 respectively). Susceptibility to metronidazole was tested in 29 isolates before and in seven isolates after treatment with metronidazole by disc diffusion test and minimum inhibitory concentration assay. Twenty seven (93%) of the isolates were sensitive before treatment while six of seven (86%) were resistant afterwards. Four of the six resistant strains had acquired resistance during treatment and one of these had acquired metronidazole resistance despite concomitant treatment with amoxycillin, to which it remained sensitive. CBS with adjuvant metronidazole at a dose of 400 mg tid for seven days significantly improves the eradication of H pylori compared with CBS alone. Acquired metronidazole resistance, however, seems to be an important cause of failure to eradicate H pylori.\r"

The cholesterol and phospholipid are subsequently exposed to the bile salts contained in the bile, which leads to the process of micellation. Two situations may arise depending on whether there is enough bile salt in proportion to cholesterol to complete this \"maturation\" process. If the cholesterol saturation is low, at equilibrium the bile salts will have completely micellized the vesicles. On the other hand, if bile is saturated with cholesterol, the micellation process is incomplete and vesicles and micelles will be present at equilibrium. The residual vesicle in this latter situation may have a higher cholesterol/phospholipid ratio because of the greater propensity of phospholipid to be micellized. This situation may result in cholesterol nucleation. The mechanism of nucleation from vesicles and the possible role of nucleating and antinucleating proteins in this process have been discussed.\r"

These methods all share the disadvantage of being model dependent, thus making data analysis indirect and inferential; this is in addition to constraints unique to each of the several nonimaging methods. It is suggested that to achieve optimal accuracy in vesicle studies, a combination of different structural methods should be used where possible.\r"

We also describe the design of a \"home-built\" laser light-scattering apparatus used in the authors' laboratory for the physicochemical study of model and native biles. These powerful techniques provide nonperturbing measurements of the sizes, polydispersities and, in suitable cases, concentrations and shapes of simple micelles, mixed micelles, vesicles and large proteins in bile. the sizes of these aggregates (10 to 2,000 A) fall within limits resolvable by laser light and are conventionally expressed as mean hydrodynamic radii, Rh. Static light-scattering measurements of biliary lipid aggregates provide molecular weights and important information concerning particle shape, whereas quasielastic (also referred to as dynamic) light-scattering measurements assess particle sizes and polydispersities. Under favorable circumstances, quasielastic light scattering allows simultaneous determinations of sizes and concentrations of coexisting particle populations. The use of laser light-scattering technology in solving the solution properties and the physicochemical structures of model and native biles is detailed. In view of the extraordinarily diverse backgrounds of researchers in the gallstone field (e.g., internists, surgeons, biochemists, physicists), we believe that the present article (which relies heavily on graphical representations) will afford a better understanding of the usefulness and limitations of laser light-scattering techniques, particularly in their applications to the study of bile.\r"

Moderate changes in temperature, flow rate or sample size produced only minor differences in the results. Increments in bile salt concentration in the elution buffer caused progressive disappearance of vesicles and a rise in their cholesterol/phospholipid ratio. Using the standard chromatographic technique, analyses of the same bile gave reproducible results, and comparisons among various biles were possible. Quantitative light scattering measurements of bile showed that the amount of vesicular cholesterol in whole unprocessed bile was similar to that measured by Sephacryl chromatography. Analyses of human gallbladder biles using a high-resolution Sephacryl column showed four cholesterol-containing peaks: vesicles, lamellae, mixed micelles and an undefined carrier. This long chromatographic column separated the lamellar from the micellar peaks (which had merged on the short column). Phospholipid lamellae solubilized most of the biliary cholesterol. These findings were confirmed by ultracentrifugation of bile.\r"

  ".W": "The vesicular and micellar carriers of biliary cholesterol were isolated and quantitated from native bile by a simple and short isopyknic ultracentrifugal method. The method was designed to decrease the potential pitfalls of classic ultracentrifugation: osmotic effects of the centrifugation media and hydrostatic pressure effects generated in the centrifuge tube. This was accomplished by using metrizamide as an inert centrifugation medium for isopyknic separation and a vertical rotor. The buoyant density of vesicles isolated from human native bile varied between 1.010 and 1.030 gm/ml, as determined in preformed bile-metrizamide density gradients after 285 min of centrifugation. When 16% metrizamide was directly dissolved in bile, its density increased to 1.060 gm/ml. After 120 min of centrifugation, it was found that more than 95% of total vesicular cholesterol floated at the top of the centrifuge tube. This fraction appeared as one or two white opalescent bands. The present ultracentrifugal method was validated by gel filtration chromatography. It was found that more than 95% of vesicular cholesterol migrated to the top 0.4 ml of the centrifuge tube after the short-run centrifugation. Approximately 5% of total biliary cholesterol present in the vesicular fractions was in fact solubilized in mixed micelles as assessed by gel filtration chromatography. Although the proportion of vesicles and micelles estimated with the present ultracentrifugal method is in the range reported by other authors using the more common chromatographic method, we believe that our method has two major advantages. First, it eliminates the dilutional effect of buffers necessary for gel filtration chromatography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91007648\r", 
  ".W": "A significant amount of biliary cholesterol is carried in unilamellar-phospholipid (lecithin) vesicles, in both supersaturated human hepatic bile and unsaturated rat bile. This fact supports the concept that biliary cholesterol is normally secreted in phospholipid vesicles from the hepatocyte into the canaliculus. The fundamental aspects of biliary lipid secretion relate first to the quantitative determinants of hepatocytic cholesterol secretion into the bile and, second, to the cell biology of this process. There is a tight curvilinear coupling between the rates of bile acids and biliary lipid secretion in all animal species. The hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool may modify this cosecretory mechanism in that more hydrophobic bile acids recruit more phospholipid and cholesterol per mole of bile acid secreted into the bile. The quantitative significance of this effect, however, is relatively minor. In contrast, intrahepatic determinants, such as the rates of hepatic cholesterol esterification and very low density lipoprotein production modulated by dietary factors, may markedly change the amount of cholesterol carried in vesicles into the bile. Recent studies provide strong evidence to support the concept that biliary cholesterol output is also modulated by the amount of free cholesterol available in specific regions of the endoplasmic reticulum for recruitment by the bile acid cosecretory mechanism. The origin of biliary lipids is in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The intracellular transport and the canalicular secretory mechanism of the precursor of biliary lipid vesicles is mostly unknown. Two theories related to the cell biology of biliary lipid secretion are discussed in this article, the fusion-budding model and the exocytotic model.\r"

  ".W": "Present concepts suggest that the canalicular secretion of bile salts is monomeric, which in turn drives the hepatic secretion of lecithin and cholesterol presumably as unilamellar vesicles into bile. As biliary lipids are concentrated within the biliary tree and gallbladder, bile salts structurally alter lecithin-cholesterol vesicles to form a variety of metastable aggregates whose structures and phase transformations are predicted by phase equilibria considerations. These structural transformations ultimately result in the dispersion of biliary lipids as thermodynamically stable micelles or micelles plus thermodynamically unstable vesicles in common duct and gallbladder biles. The experiments reviewed herein represent experimental simulations of these processes. We used pure aqueous lipid systems to model the putative stages of biliary lipid aggregation on the basis of interactions of small unilamellar vesicles of lecithin-cholesterol with bile salts as the latter's concentrations were varied from below to well above the critical micellar concentration. With submicellar bile salt concentrations likely to be found within hepatocytes, vesicle structures are not appreciably altered. However, perimicellar bile salt concentrations possibly occurring in canaliculi and bile ductules induce the formation of a hexagonal rodlike phase. On further increases in bile salt concentration, the hexagonal rods (formed from lecithin-rich and cholesterol-poor vesicles) are dissolved into mixed micelles as bile salt concentrations exceed their critical micellar concentrations. In slightly cholesterol-\"supersaturated\" biles, the rapid dissolution of this intermediate phase results in the formation of cholesterol-supersaturated mixed micelles that, in time, give rise to a new population of cholesterol-rich vesicles that coexist with saturated micelles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This equilibrium solubilizing ratio is an increasing function of the cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine ratio. In contrast, the concentration of sodium cholate required for solubilization of vesicles made of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol does not increase by increasing the cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine ratio. Consequently, the latter solubilization procedure yields metastable mixed micelles whenever the cholate concentration is higher than that required for vesicle solubilization but lower than that needed for establishing a micellar equilibrium. These metastable mixed micelles undergo partial revesiculation to form cholesterol-rich vesicles that subsequently aggregate. Cholesterol crystallization appears to occur through its reorganization within these aggregated vesicles. The overall rate of the above series of processes increases sharply with the total lipid concentration and with the cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine ratio. The dependence of the rate on the effective ratio of bile salts/lipids is very complex: at any given ratio of cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine within the range of 0.3 to 0.5, increasing the cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine ratio requires higher cholate concentrations for the formation of stable mixed micelles (higher equilibrium solubilizing ratio). On the other hand, the metastable mixed micellar larsystems are long-lived whenever the effective ratio of cholate/lipids is lower than a critical value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The nucleation step in crystallization for all such systems has been a difficult process to describe. Even the definition of what constitutes a \"nucleus\" remains elusive because one is dealing with a conceptual construct that is found only in the submicroscopic domain and therefore is inaccessible to direct measurement. Based on these considerations, the so-called nucleation time assay can at best only be taken as an empirical parameter. Nucleation (operationally defined) and growth of cholesterol monohydrate crystals in both model and native biles occurs rapidly after aggregation of supersaturated vesicles. Cholesterol made available for crystal growth also originates from the vesicular pathway and not directly from biliary micelles. The exact mechanism(s) governing this linked \"precursor-product\" relationship remains undefined.\r"

Efficient hepatic clearance of bile acids involves several active systems and passive uptake. Formation of coenzyme A derivatives prevents reflux of lipophilic dihydroxy bile acids. Biotransformation of bile acids during hepatocyte transport involves both type I and type II biotransformations. The major type II biotransformation is reamidation of unconjugated bile acids, but sulfation and glucuronidation also occur. The only major type I biotransformation is oxidoreduction, which converts iso- or 3 oxo bile acids to the preferred 3 alpha-hydroxy form and 7 oxo bile acids to their corresponding 7 alpha-hydroxy derivatives. Secretion of bile acids into the canaliculus is concentrative and induces osmotic flow of plasma water and solutes across the paracellular junctions between the space of Disse and the canaliculus. Bile flow in man is characterized by its low volume and by a paucity of bile acid-independent flow when compared with that of other mammals. Bile acid secretion also induces biliary lipid secretion, but some lipid secretion appears to be bile acid independent. The lipid vesicles secreted in human bile have a much higher cholesterol/phospholipid ratio than those of other mammals. During flow down the biliary tree, vesicles are solubilized by bile acid micelles, and Ca++ ions are complexed by bile acid monomers and micelles. However, the biochemical mechanisms and factors regulating biliary lipid secretion in man are poorly understood.\r"

Hypersecretion of gallbladder mucus occurs in response to a lithogenic diet in experimental animals, and mucus accumulates as a viscous gel within the gallbladder lumen before gallstone formation. In both animals and man, the initial stage of cholesterol gallstone formation, the nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals, occurs within the mucus gel. Inhibition of mucus secretion with aspirin prevents gallstone formation in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog, indicating the importance of mucus in gallstone formation. Mucin contains domains that bind cholesterol and lecithin transported as vesicles in supersaturated bile. Furthermore, mucin accelerates the nucleation of cholesterol crystals in both supersaturated model and native biles. Binding of cholesterol-enriched vesicles to hydrophobic domains on the mucin protein core appears to be critical for the acceleration of cholesterol crystal nucleation by mucin. Further study of the structure and function of gallbladder mucin should help to elucidate the pathogenesis of cholesterol cholelithiasis.\r"

The activity is heat labile and sensitive to digestion by glycosidase but remarkably insensitive to proteases. The concanavalin A-binding pronucleator affects cholesterol solubilization in model bile in two ways. It induces a shift of cholesterol and phospholipid from the micellar to the vesicular phase but also interacts directly with cholesterol-phospholipid vesicles. The concanavalin A-binding protein fraction contains at least two different promoting factors with gel permeation molecular weights of about 150 kD and 5 kD, respectively. The higher molecular weight activity could be assigned to a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 130 kD. Concanavalin A-binding-promoting activity was present in bile from both patients with and without stones, indicating that it is a normal constituent of bile. However, the activity was strongly increased in bile from patients with multiple cholesterol gallstones, suggesting that it could play a key role in gallstone formation in these patients.\r"

Progress in purification of biliary effector proteins has been slow and hindered by the lack of a sensitive and convenient assay method. The formidable problems of removing large amounts of both mucin and lipids from the samples before isolation of biliary proteins has constituted another major obstacle. Recently, the combination of a newly developed nucleation and crystal growth assay and the systematic use of lectin affinity chromatography has enabled rapid progress to be made. With these approaches, glycoprotein fractions containing primarily inhibiting activity and other fractions containing primarily promoting activity have been isolated from normal human biles. Thus these opposing activities can coexist and influence a balance of effects potentially defining the presence of health or disease. The most recent studies have led to the isolation of a single glycoprotein having an extremely potent crystal growth-inhibiting activity.\r"

It layers in the most dependent part of the gallbladder and shifts with positioning. Particulate matter in bile, such as cholesterol monohydrate crystals, has been shown to be echogenic. Agglomeration of these crystals in biles with high mucus content accounts for the layering and the characteristic appearance of the movement of sludge with alteration in patient position. Within the gallbladder, the stability of the vesicular form of cholesterol and protein-lipid interactions are important determinants of cholesterol precipitation. In mixed and pigment gallstones, the equilibrium between ionized and unionized calcium and the hydrolysis of conjugated bilirubin are also important factors. Although the risk factors contributing to the formation of gallbladder sludge have not been critically examined, it is now known that in some instances sludge can produce biliary pain and can be associated with acalculous cholecystitis, recurrent pancreatitis and, ultimately, the formation of gallstones. A better appreciation of the pathogenesis of sludge formation can help in the understanding of the genesis of gallstones and also perhaps in understanding other documented but poorly understood biliary and pancreatic disorders.\r"

Using this powerful analytical tool, new concepts and findings have arisen in almost every aspect of biliary calcium. Although the current symposium is targeted primarily toward cholesterol gallstones, there are several areas in which understanding of biliary calcium may significantly contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of cholesterol, as well as \"pigment\" (calcium salt), gallstones. Five broad areas are considered in relation to biliary calcium: (a) physiology (calcium entry into bile), (b) biophysics (the regulation of biliary free [Ca+(+)] as related to Gibbs-Donnan equilibria, (c) physical chemistry (the physicochemical state of calcium in bile, (d) thermodynamics (calcium solubility in bile), and (e) kinetics (pronucleating and antinucleating factors and metastable states). With more specific reference to cholesterol stones, consideration is also made of (a) the calcium salt \"seed\" hypothesis in cholesterol stone pathogenesis; (b) the interactions of Ca+(+) with phospholipid-cholesterol vesicles, with consideration of possible structural requirements and (c) thermodynamic and kinetic factors as related to peripheral or \"eggshell\" calcification of existing cholesterol stones.\r"

The pigments are primarily monomeric calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin anions and/or an insoluble, black, network polymer of tetrapyrroles. Bilirubin presumably can precipitate only if bile is supersaturated with calcium bilirubinates. Among various in vitro model systems, the aqueous solubilities and pK'a values for unconjugated bilirubin differ greatly. It is therefore not known whether normal bile is saturated with unconjugated bilirubin. However, all systems indicate that unconjugated bilirubin is solubilized by binding to bile salt monomers and oligomers, as well as micelles; marked metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin can occur in the presence of bile salt micelles, and both pK'a values of unconjugated bilirubin are greater than 6.0, probably because of internal hydrogen-bonding of the--COOH groups. Lecithin decreases equilibrium solubilization of unconjugated bilirubin crystals but enhances metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin. Calcium ions form insoluble salts with unconjugated bilirubin monoanions and dianions but soluble complexes with bilirubin conjugates. The solubility products of the calcium bilirubinate salts suggest that normal hepatic bile is not saturated with CaB or Ca(HB)2 but that gallbladder bile may be supersaturated with Ca(HB)2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This, in turn, largely explains the prolonged stability of cholesterol solubilized in supersaturated human bile. Under certain overall compositional conditions for a supersaturated native bile, the vesicular phase in its contribution to total cholesterol transport also becomes supersaturated in cholesterol. Because of this, the vesicles also become unstable, leading to formation of cholesterol crystals. A simple but common example of one factor affecting composition in this way is concentration of total solutes, especially the biliary lipids. Conversely, dilution of bile (e.g., hepatic bile) markedly reduces the cholesterol saturation level in biliary vesicles. The result is that such vesicles become much more stable. Under these conditions, cholesterol crystal formation becomes unlikely and rarely, if ever, occurs.\r"

Quasielastic light scattering investigations of aqueous bile salt solutions have indicated important similarities and differences between the various bile salt species and have led to a quantitative model for the formation of globular and rodlike micelles, based on Small and Ekwall's primary-secondary micelle hypothesis. Studies of aqueous bile salt-lecithin systems have indicated three important aggregation regimens dependent on the lecithin/bile salt molar ratio and total solute concentration. Region I of the phase diagram, which includes the lecithin/bile salt and total solute concentration values found in most mammalian biles, corresponds to a population of \"simple\" bile salt micelles coexisting in equilibrium with a population of mixed bile salt-lecithin micelles. Region II contains only mixed micelles, whose apparent size and shape vary with lecithin/bile salt and total solute concentration in a manner consistent with a \"mixed disc\" model. In this model, bile salts not only coat the perimeter of the disc (as proposed in Small's original model) but are also incorporated within the lecithin bilayer, possibly as hydrogen-bonded dimers. Finally, in region III, where total solute concentration values are typically less than the critical micelle concentration of the pure bile salt, the systems contain mixed vesicles (spherical bilayer shells) whose size (approximately 130 to 500A) depends on lecithin/bile salt and total solute concentration in accordance with a simple partition equilibrium that determines the composition of the mixed vesicle bilayer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present studies, two dialysis membranes with molecular weight cut-off of 8,000 and 12,000 to 14,000 Da, respectively, and two sets of solution volume conditions were investigated with the taurocholate-lecithin system. Coexistence data were obtained over a wide range of lecithin concentrations and the results were found to be in good agreement with those from the previous studies. The bile salt/lecithin molar ratios for the mixed micelles were also deduced from the data. The principal conclusion of this study is that although there is a moderate amount of variability (10% to 15%), the method is both satisfactory and useful in studying bile salt-lecithin equilibria and dynamics.\r"

  ".W": "Bile salts, phospholipids and sterols are the major lipid species in bile. The common bile salts possess a steroid nucleus of four fused hydrocarbon rings with polar hydroxyl functions and an aliphatic side chain conjugated in amide linkage with glycine or taurine. Since the ionized carboxylate or sulfonate group on the side chain renders bile salts water soluble, they are formally classified as soluble amphiphiles. The common bile salts differ in the number and orientation of the hydroxyl groups on the steroid nucleus. Bile salts synthesized from cholesterol in the liver are called primary bile salts, which in humans are cholate, with three hydroxyl groups, and chenodeoxycholate, with two hydroxyl groups. Secondary bile salts are created by the action of intestinal bacteria on primary bile salts; deoxycholate, with two hydroxyl groups, and lithocholate, with a single hydroxyl group, are formed from cholate and chenodeoxycholate, respectively. \"Tertiary\" bile salts are the result of modification of secondary bile salts by intestinal flora or hepatocytes; in humans these are the sulfate ester of lithocholate and ursodeoxycholate, the 7 beta-epimer of chenodeoxycholate. Lecithin (diacylphosphatidylcholine), the major phospholipid in bile, is an insoluble, swelling amphiphile with a hydrophilic, zwitterionic phosphocholine head group and hydrophobic tails comprised of two long fatty acyl chains. Biliary lecithin is derived from the least hydrophobic hepatic lecithins and typically contains a saturated C-16 acyl chain in the sn-1 position and an unsaturated C-18 or C-20 acyl chain in the sn-2 position. Cholesterol, present solely as the nonesterified free alcohol, accounts for more than 90% to 95% of the sterols in bile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91007667\r", 
  ".W": "Membrane fusion constitutes an essential, intermediate step in numerous cell biological processes, occurring for example during endocytosis, membrane recycling and exocytosis. Also less desirable events such as the infection of cells by animal viruses are mediated by membrane fusion during which the viral envelope merges with a cellular membrane, causing the expulsion of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm of the cell as an initial step in virus replication. Much of our current knowledge concerning the mechanism of membrane fusion has been derived from studies using simple artificial membranes, such as liposomes or phospholipid vesicles, as model systems. A most essential feature of these studies has been the development of membrane fusion assays that register in a sensitive and continuous fashion the mixing of membranes or the aqueous volumes initially enclosed by these membranes. Not only do these assays allow one to readily detect and quantify fusion, but they also provide the possibility to relate the kinetics of fusion to the rate by which certain molecular changes in membranes take place. Obviously, this insight is of relevance for understanding the mechanism of membrane fusion. The principles and applications of some representative assays that rely on the use of fluorescence spectroscopy will be discussed. Assays that monitor membrane mixing are commonly based on the detection of changes in resonance energy transfer efficiency or the relief of fluorescence self-quenching of appropriate fluorescent lipid analogs. Contents mixing assays rely on either the formation of a (aqueous-soluble) fluorescent complex or quenching of a fluorophore, encapsulated in one vesicle population, by a suitable quencher, entrapped in a second population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These include membrane composition, vesicle size, various cations, membrane phase state, dehydrating agents and proteins. Several hypotheses are presented for the mechanism by which bile vesicles aggregate and fuse. It is proposed that phase-separated domains of cholesterol in the bile vesicle bilayer mediate the close approach of the vesicles and that molecular packing defects at the domain boundaries mediate hydrophobic interaction between and fusion of apposed membranes. The apposition or fusion of the membranes may provide the third dimension within which the cholesterol domains on apposed or collapsed membranes can begin to form the monohydrate crystal. Other mediators of aggregation and fusion are likely to be proteins that interact hydrophobically with the bile vesicle and diacylglycerol formed in the vesicles by phospholipase C action. Ca2+ is thought to enhance fusion by interacting with bile salts in the membrane or with membrane-associated proteins.\r"

At equilibrium, phosphatidylcholine bilayers are saturated when equimolar levels of cholesterol are incorporated; the cholesterol molecules interfere with the cooperative lateral interactions of the phosphatidylcholine acyl chains and restrict the fluidity relative to pure liquid-crystal phosphatidylcholine bilayers. Mixed cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine bilayers containing more than equimolar cholesterol are metastable; on storage excess cholesterol is released from the vesicles and forms cholesterol monohydrate crystals. This process models the formation of cholesterol gallstones in bile and the growth of the crystals probably involves, at least in part, diffusion of cholesterol molecules from the vesicle bilayer to the crystal surface. The cholesterol-phosphatidylcholine interaction energy in the lipid-water interface of the donor vesicle has a critical effect on the rate of this transfer process.\r"

The half times for transfer between the mixed micelles are 200 to 6,000 times faster than between vesicles, depending on the acyl chain length of the N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine and the total lipid concentration. A kinetic analysis of the rates of phospholipid transfer between vesicles indicated that transfer occurs predominantly as soluble monomers moving through the water phase. Transfer between mixed micelles was found to occur by the same aqueous diffusion mechanism at low lipid concentrations, but at high lipid concentrations, transfer occurs predominantly during transient micelle collisions. The faster rate of transfer between mixed micelles relative to vesicles results both from the collision-dependent transfer and from an increase in the rate-limiting step for aqueous diffusion-phospholipid dissociation from the micelle surface. The relative contribution of collision-dependent transfer to the overall transfer rate increases with phospholipid acyl chain length and total lipid concentration. For the phospholipid species and mixed micelle concentrations normally found in the biliary tract, the predominant mode of transfer is predicted to occur by the collision-dependent mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Cholesterol in bile has been linked to the incidence of gallstone disease through the concept of supersaturation as measured by the cholesterol saturation index. The latter is a linear function of cholesterol concentration and is based on the assumption that all cholesterol in bile is solubilized and transported in bile salt-lecithin mixed micelles and in bile salt simple micelles. In light of the discovery of the cholesterol-lecithin vesicles as significant cholesterol carriers, there is a need to reevaluate this old concept. This study examined the feasibility of the silicone polymer uptake method for the direct determination of the cholesterol thermodynamic activity in model bile systems. In cases of unsaturation and near saturation, a linear relationship was observed between the cholesterol concentration in the silicone polymer at equilibrium and the cholesterol saturation index (the cholesterol concentration in the aqueous micellar solution at equilibrium/cholesterol monohydrate solubility in the same medium) for taurocholate and taurochenodeoxycholate systems either containing or not containing lecithin. In taurocholate-lecithin solutions supersaturated with cholesterol, the linear relationship continued to hold up to the point where vesicles started to form. Vesicle formation initiated a negative deviation from linearity. At constant lecithin concentration, the cholesterol thermodynamic activity at which vesicle formation began was a function of the taurocholate/lecithin ratio; the larger the taurocholate/lecithin ratio, the higher the cholesterol thermodynamic activity for the onset of vesicle formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91007672\r", 
  ".W": "On the basis of phase equilibria theory and experimental data, we discuss the identity, separation and quantitation of cholesterol-solubilizing lipid aggregates in bile, trivially known as cholesterol \"carriers.\" We first describe analogies (as well as lack of correspondence) between equilibrium phase diagrams of aqueous bile salt, lecithin and cholesterol systems and phase equilibria in native biles. At equilibrium, the possible number and types of different cholesterol \"carriers\" are limited by constraints placed by the phase rule. These \"carriers\" include simple micelles (bile salts without lecithin), mixed micelles (bile salts plus lecithin), a lecithin plus cholesterol lamellar phase composed of single bilayer structures (vesicles) or multilamellar structures (liquid crystals) and possibly fragments of a hexagonal phase. Clearly, in this context, cholesterol monohydrate crystals, no matter how small, cannot be considered \"carriers.\" We also use a metastable \"phase diagram\" for aqueous taurocholate-egg yolk lecithin-cholesterol systems to interpret physicochemical studies on the formation and stability of native biles. In biliary lipid systems, bile salt monomers with or without simple bile salt micelles are present in the aqueous \"phase\" in equilibrium with mixed micelles/or vesicles. This bile salt concentration is designated the intermicellar concentration but actually represents the total nonmixed micellar/nonvesicular concentration of bile salts (i.e., bile salt monomers and simple bile salt micelles when present) and may be a value that falls below, equal to or above the critical micellar concentration of the bile salts. Experimental estimates of the intermicellar-intervesicular bile salt concentration in model systems are compared with the range of bile salt concentrations that has been used in the literature to separate the presently accepted cholesterol \"carriers\" (mixed micelles and vesicles) in both model and native biles. We also reinterpret published lipid compositions of phases separated from human bile, using both a nonequilibrium \"phase diagram\" and an equilibrium phase diagram for the model system, taurocholate-egg yolk lecithin-cholesterol. From these analyses, we conclude that precise quantitation of cholesterol \"carriers\" in bile awaits methods to accurately determine the intermicellar-intervesicular concentration of bile salts in any individual bile, as well as advances in nonperturbing separatory procedures, and methods to control the thermal and temporal history of native bile samples.\r"

  ".W": "Biosynthesis of the polyamines, putrescine, spermidine and spermine, is required for DNA synthesis and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Chronic ethanol consumption impairs polyamine synthesis during the prereplicative phase after partial hepatectomy. To determine whether this delay in polyamine synthesis contributes to ethanol's inhibition of liver regeneration, the ability of supplemental putrescine to improve regeneration in ethanol-fed rats was tested. Chronically ethanol-fed rats and isocalorically maintained controls underwent partial hepatectomy and were injected intraperitoneally with saline or putrescine (0.03 or 0.30 mmol/kg) at 0, 4, 8 and 12 hr after partial hepatectomy. Rats were killed at 24, 48 or 72 hr, 1 hr after exposure to [3H]thymidine, so that DNA synthesis could be estimated. DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited in ethanol-fed rats treated with saline compared with saline-treated pair-fed controls. Supplemental putrescine did not affect DNA synthesis in pair-fed rats. In contrast, putrescine significantly improved [3H]thymidine incorporation 24 to 72 hr after partial hepatectomy in ethanol-fed rats. Intraperitoneal injection of putrescine (1.2 mmol/kg) at the time of partial hepatectomy increased hepatic polyamine concentrations for the first 6 hr after partial hepatectomy despite significantly inhibiting the activity of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine synthesis, in both groups. Hepatic polyamine levels after putrescine injection were greater in ethanol-fed rats than in similarly treated controls. These data suggest that putrescine treatment triggers events that normalize DNA synthesis in ethanol-fed rats. These results confirm the hypothesis that ethanol's antiregenerative mechanism intimately involves inhibition of putrescine synthesis.\r"

To examine this possibility, the susceptibility of Hep G2 cells to infection with a variety of rotavirus strains was tested. These cells were used because they are considered to be well differentiated and exhibit many liver-specific functions. The Hep G2 cells supported the growth of the simian strain rhesus rotavirus (MMU 18006), a strain currently being used in vaccine trails, but did not support the growth of any human strain (D, DS1, Price or ST3). The rhesus rotavirus infection was cytopathic and resulted in release of lactate dehydrogenase. Rhesus rotavirus growth in Hep G2 cells displayed trypsin-enhanced infectivity and was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase but not with neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens. Hep G2 cells were also permissive for another simian strain (SA11), a bovine strain (UK) and single gene substitution reassortants containing VP7 (the major outer capsid neutralization protein) from a human rotavirus strain and the remaining 10 genes from either rhesus rotavirus or UK. In general, UK and its reassortants produced lower levels of antigen than did rhesus rotavirus and its reassortants. Hep G2 cells and other hepatic cell lines may prove to be useful tools to explore the hepatotropic potential of wild-type rotaviruses and candidate vaccine strains.\r"

In contrast, very little activity was generated under the same culture conditions when nonparenchymal liver cells were used as the responding cells. It was concluded that Kupffer cells produced prostaglandin and interferon alpha/beta, which suppressed lymphokine-activated-killer induction because (a) induction of lymphokine-activated-killer activity from nonparenchymal liver cells was observed in the presence of indomethacin and anti-interferon alpha/beta antibody; (b) when adherent nonparenchymal liver cells, primarily Kupffer cells, were removed, lymphokine-activated-killer activity could be obtained with interleukin-2 alone; (c) coculture of Kupffer cells with nonadherent nonparenchymal liver cells in a two-chambered system inhibited lymphokine-activated killer cell induction in a dose-dependent manner; (d) exogenous prostaglandin E2 and interferon alpha/beta added at the start of culture inhibited interleukin-2-induced cytotoxicity and proliferation, whereas the other major prostaglandin species in the liver, prostaglandin D2, had little effect. These findings are distinctive with Kupffer cells because splenic macrophages did not exert such inhibition in parallel experiments. Moreover, the supernatant collected from the 24-hr culture of nonparenchymal liver cells contained greater than 20-fold more prostaglandin E2 and interferon alpha/beta than that from culture of spleen cells. In subsequent in vivo experiments, when interleukin-2 was given intraperitoneally to mice, the combination of indomethacin and anti-interferon alpha/beta antibody significantly enhanced lymphokine-activated-killer activity recovered from the liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, all patients with hepatitis B virus-DNA in convalescent sera were hepatitis B virus-DNA negative 3 to 6 mo later. All patients with HBeAg-positive samples showed hepatitis B virus-DNA positivity by polymerase chain reaction. For acute hepatitis, gene amplification restores the relationship between HBeAg and hepatitis B virus-DNA observed in serum from chronic hepatitis B patients and calls attention to the prolonged presence of hepatitis B virus-DNA in serum after generally accepted criteria for resolution of the infection have been reached.\r"

Analysis of the data before HBeAg clearance showed that both a high serum ALT level and a low serum hepatitis B virus DNA level correlated with an imminent clearance of HBeAg. Approximately two thirds of children with serum ALT levels higher than 100 IU/L cleared HBeAg within the following year. Clearance of HBeAg occurred within the following year in 65% (13 of 20) of cases with serum hepatitis B virus DNA level less than or equal to 1,000 pg/ml, in contrast to 19% (30 of 157) of those with serum hepatitis B virus DNA level greater than 1,000 pg/ml.

Using serum positive for the antibody as a probe, we isolated the target antigen by Iatrobeads column chromatography. Analysis by thin-layer chromatography and negative ion fast atom-bombardment mass spectrometry revealed that the antigen was sulfatide. The presence of antisulfatide antibody was also confirmed by immunoblotting. The reactivity of the serum with sulfatide was diminished by preincubation of the serum with galactosylceramide-6-sulfate and sulfatide, indicating that the antibody reacted with sulfated galactosylceramide regardless of the position of the sulfate residue. The antibody was found in 92.3%, 42.9%, 15.8%, 14.2%, 0% and 0%, respectively, of patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic active hepatitis and chronic persistent hepatitis. Thus antisulfatide antibody was characteristic of autoimmune-type chronic liver diseases. Antisulfatide antibody was absorbed by rabbit hepatocyte plasma membrane. Preincubation of sera with sulfatide immobilized on Sepharose decreased their reactivities with not only sulfatide but also rabbit plasma membrane and rat hepatocytes. Therefore sulfatide may be a target antigen of the antibody to hepatocyte surface membrane.\r"

Nontumor liver tissue was analyzed from three separate areas. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in two of these; restriction-enzyme digestion suggested they contained different sites of viral integration. As with the typical hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma, analysis of hepatitis B virus DNA from nontumorous liver yielded a different pattern of high-molecular-weight bands, indicating that the virus genome had integrated at different chromosomal locations than that seen in the tumor. The finding of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA, especially in tumorous but also in nontumorous liver, would be consistent with an oncogenic role for hepatitis B virus in certain instances of fibrolamellar tumors and in the more typical hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Twenty-eight patients were positive for HBs antigen, 26 patients had received blood transfusions and were negative for HBs antigen and 26 patients had a history of heavy drinking. We detected hepatocellular carcinoma in 40 patients during this period. The overall cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the 6 yr was 39%; the cumulative incidence was 59% in patients with HBsAg, 53% in patients who had had blood transfusions and were negative for HBsAg and 22% in patients who had a history of heavy drinking and who were without HBsAg. Detection of the carcinoma in 85% of these 40 patients was based on results of ultrasonography. Twenty-six of the patients (65%) had a small hepatocellular carcinoma of 2 cm or less. alpha-Fetoprotein levels were lower than 100 ng/ml in 56% of these 40 patients. Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, especially patients with HBsAg or with a history of blood transfusion who are negative for HBsAg. Periodic monitoring by use of ultrasonography in particular is recommended for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

This study assesses the value of the auditory P300 event-related potential--a slow component of the auditory evoked response--as a tool in this field. Twenty-one nonencephalopathic and 12 encephalopathic (grade 1/2) cirrhotic patients and 26 controls were assessed clinically and psychometrically. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis and visual evoked response recordings were also conducted. An auditory P300 wave was elicited using the standard two-tone discrimination paradigm. The latency and amplitude of this wave were measured. The latency of the P300 was found to be significantly increased in the encephalopathic patients compared with both nonencephalopathic cirrhotic and control groups (p less than 0.05). Amplitude of the wave was decreased in both nonencephalopathic and encephalopathic patients, but this was not statistically significant. This study suggests that the latency of the P300 is a good marker of grades 1 and 2 clinical hepatic encephalopathy. The delays in the P300 latency may indicate that encephalopathic patients have a deterioration of their stimulus evaluation abilities.\r"

In this study the role of brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems in hepatic encephalopathy was investigated in rats with thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure. Concentrations of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline and of their metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, dihydroxyphenylalanine (following inhibition of dihydroxyphenylalanine-decarboxylase), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-glycol, were measured in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. In hepatic encephalopathy concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were increased in all three brain areas (196%, 204% and 264% of saline-treated controls, p less than 0.01), and concentrations of serotonin were increased in the frontal cortex (121%, p less than 0.01). In the frontal cortex and hippocampus of encephalopathic rats dopamine levels were increased (157% and 289%, p less than 0.05), and levels of noradrenaline (53% and 46%, p less than 0.05) were decreased associated with increased 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol levels (173% and 206%, p less than 0.05). The extent of these changes correlated with the stage of hepatic encephalopathy. In hepatic encephalopathy dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation was increased in the hippocampus and unchanged in the cerebral cortex. Dopamine, noradrenaline, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid concentrations were unchanged in the striatum. The results of this study indicate that hepatic encephalopathy in thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure in rats is associated with neurochemical changes, suggesting an increased activity of the noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems.\r"

Carbamoylphosphate synthetase, the first and flux-determining enzyme of the cycle, is found only in a large periportal compartment, and glutamine synthetase is found only in a small, complementary pericentral compartment. Because it is not possible to manipulate experimentally the intrahepatic distribution of carbamoylphosphate synthetase and glutamine synthetase, we looked for conditions in which explanted hepatocytes would exhibit either the carbamoylphosphate synthetase phenotype or glutamine synthetase phenotype. In the spleen hepatocytes either settle as individual cells or in small agglomerates. The dispersed cells only express the carbamoylphosphate synthetase phenotype. Within the agglomerates, sinusoids that drain on venules develop. Hepatocytes surrounding the venules stain only weakly for carbamoylphosphate synthetase but are strongly positive for glutamine synthetase. These observations were made for explanted embryonic hepatocytes (no prior expression of either carbamoylphosphate synthetase or glutamine synthetase), neonatal hepatocytes (compartments of gene expression not yet established) and adult periportal and pericentral hepatocytes.\r"

Few details are available regarding the variant of ascitic fluid infection in which the culture grows bacteria (pure growth of a single type of organism), but the neutrophil count is less than 250 cells/mm3. In this prospective study of 138 episodes of culture-positive spontaneously infected ascites detected in 105 patients, 44 (31.9%) were episodes of \"monomicrobial nonneutrocytic bacterascites\" compared with 94 (68.1%) episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Seventeen patients had both types of infection. The infection-related mortality and hospitalization mortality were similar between the two groups. Patients with bacterascites appeared to have less severe liver disease. In 62% of bacterascites episodes in which a second paracentesis was performed before any treatment the fluid spontaneously became sterile without development of ascitic fluid neutrocytosis. Thirty-eight percent of patients with bacterascites (who underwent a second paracentesis before treatment was started) progressed to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis--sometimes within a few hours. The concentration of the chemoattractant C5a was not decreased in the ascitic fluid of the bacterascites patients; this excludes ascitic fluid C5a deficiency as the explanation of the lack of neutrocytosis. Monomicrobial nonneutrocytic bacterascites is a common variant of ascitic fluid infection that may resolve without treatment or may progress to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\r"

At entry, both groups were similar with respect to clinical and laboratory data, ascitic fluid protein and polymorphonuclear concentrations, number of previous episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and causative organisms of the index spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Norfloxacin administration produced a selective intestinal decontamination (elimination of aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the fecal flora without significant changes in other microorganisms) throughout the study in six patients in whom the effect of norfloxacin on the fecal flora was periodically assessed. Fourteen patients from the placebo group (35%) and five from the norfloxacin group (12%) developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence during follow-up (chi 2 = 5.97; p = 0.014) (mean follow-up period = 6.4 +/- 0.6 mo; range = 1 to 19 mo). Ten of the 14 spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrences in the placebo group and only one of the five spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrences in the norfloxacin group were caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli (chi 2 = 8.87; p = 0.0029). The overall probability of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence at 1 yr of follow-up was 20% in the norfloxacin group and 68% in the placebo group (p = 0.0063) and the probability of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli at 1 yr of follow-up was 3% and 60%, respectively (p = 0.0013).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In terms of frequency, this vein was more significant than the short gastric (34%) and the paraumbilical vein (24%) as a collateral route. We propose that this previously anonymous vein be called the \"posterior gastric\" vein because it runs posterior to the stomach. This vein also formed a renal shunt, a common cause of encephalopathy, in 43 (23%) of the 191 patients; the relative frequency of renal shunt formation by this vein was significantly greater than that by the left gastric vein (12%) and the short gastric vein (18%).\r"

Water and electrolyte transport and 125I-albumin absorption and protein secretion in vivo and in vitro were compared. Then similar in vitro studies were performed on human gallbladders obtained at surgery. The in vivo study in the pig was performed without disturbing the gallbladder except to tie a cannula in the cystic duct end. The in vitro model was identical in the pig and human gallbladders. Gallbladders were excised using a technique causing minimal injury and anoxia. They were oxygenated on both mucosal and serosal surfaces in a temperature-controlled environment. Luminal and external bath test solutions consisted of modified Ringers bicarbonate with added glucose; luminal solutions also contained 125I-albumin from different species, depending on the study. Active absorption of sodium and water occurred in both types of studies in the pig but in vivo absorption rates were considerably greater than in vitro rates. Albumin absorption in vivo was substantial; although present in vitro, the absorption of albumin was diminished relatively more than electrolyte transport rates. Protein secretion rates into the gallbladder were similar in vitro and in vivo. The results of studies in the human gallbladders in vitro were similar to the pig, except albumin absorption was greater. Some human gallbladders were obtained from control patients and some from patients with cholesterol gallstones. There were no significant differences between the two groups for any of the variables studied; however, the numbers were small and some control gallbladders were not normal gallbladders.\r"

These compounds are taken up by the liver and excreted into bile, although their plasma clearance and biliary excretion are reduced compared with that of unsulfated bile acids. It is not clear whether this is due to differences in intrinsic hepatic uptake or biliary excretion. In the present study, single-pass transport kinetics of chenodeoxycholic acid 3-alpha-sulfate, chenodeoxycholic acid 7-alpha-sulfate and unsulfated chenodeoxycholic acid were quantified in isolated perfused rat liver. Influx of the 7-alpha- and 3-alpha-sulfated derivatives was 57% and 20% that of chenodeoxycholic acid, respectively. These three compounds bound to albumin equally well, indicating that this was not a factor in their differential uptake. Although single-pass extraction of material taken up by the liver was identical. There was no difference in bile flow or biliary excretion of material taken up by the liver was identical. There was no difference in bile flow or biliary excretion rate, regardless of which bile acid sulfate was tested. These results indicate that the low plasma elimination of sulfated bile acids previously observed by others can be explained by low hepatic influx. The diminished transport into liver resulting from sulfation could lead to enhanced elimination of bile acids by the kidney.\r"

We recently experienced an autopsy case of systemic amyloidosis presenting the amyloid deposits in the intrahepatic biliary tree. This experience prompted us to survey 19 autopsy cases of systemic amyloidosis. Amyloid deposition was found just under the lining epithelium of the intrahepatic large bile duct in 10 of 19 cases and around the peribiliary glandular acini in 7 of the 19 cases, respectively. Amyloid deposition in the intrahepatic large bile duct and peribiliary glands was positively correlated with the degree of amyloid deposition in the liver but not with type of amyloid protein. Double-staining of amyloid and vascular endothelium disclosed that amyloid deposition was more closely related to the inner part of the peribiliary vascular plexus and to the vascular plexus encircling the peribiliary glands than the lining biliary epithelium and peribiliary glandular acinar cells themselves. The exact pathogenesis of amyloid deposition in these anatomical components, however, remains unclear. Although our cases failed to show any overt clinical symptomatologies related to amyloid deposition in these biliary components, it seems conceivable that more massive amyloid deposition in these anatomical components could give rise to some clinical symptoms.\r"

Because attempts at diagnosing small cancers with fine-needle aspiration biopsy are not possible in the absence of an associated mass lesion and because the sensitivity of exfoliative biliary cytology is controversial, brush cytology has been used as a potential means of establishing a specific diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma. Herein we report our experience with this technique when performed on 65 patients over a 5-yr period. Each had at least one brushing. Thirty-seven were found to have bile duct carcinoma and 28 were found to have benign strictures. Of these 37, the first brushing was positive for malignancy in 15 (40%), whereas four (11%) had cells suspected but not diagnostic of malignancy. Thirteen patients with bile duct carcinoma whose initial brushings were negative for malignancy had second brushings. Of these, five (38%) had malignant cells, whereas three (24%) yielded suspicious cells. Three of the eight whose first two brushings were negative for malignancy were found to have malignant cells on the third brushing. In contrast, of the 28 patients with benign strictures, malignant cells were never found. However, in two patients, suspicious cells were reported with the first but not the second brushing. A single negative or suspicious cytological finding decreased the probability of bile duct carcinoma to 43%. Two and three sequential negative tests reduced the probability to 32% and 0%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients were diagnosed between 1983 and 1987. A multivariate survival analysis (Cox regression model) using clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographical and pathological data obtained at diagnosis disclosed that bilirubin (p = 0.0001), ascites (p = 0.0001), toxic syndrome (defined by the presence of weight loss greater than 10% premorbid weight, malaise and anorexia) (p = 0.009), blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.025), tumor size (p = 0.001), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (p = 0.0006), age (p = 0.0005), serum sodium (p = 0.003) and presence of metastases (p = 0.002) were independent predictors of survival. According to the contribution of each of these factors to the final model, a prognostic index was constructed allowing division of patients in different groups according to their relative risk of death: RRD = EXP (Age x 0.03 + Ascites x 0.8281 + BUN x 0.0137 + Serum sodium x (-0.0538) + gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase x 0.0019 + Bilirubin x 0.0734 + Tumor size x 0.33 + Toxic syndrome x 0.4965 + Metastases x 0.55).

The sporadic appearance of incidental benign lesions and variability in scanning techniques, equipment and artifacts add difficulties to the evaluation of liver masses. Therefore we emphasize the need to define the problem for which the patient is being imaged. This information helps in choosing the procedure of choice and the technique needed to give the most expedient, accurate answer. This will also help apply the lowest risk and most cost-efficient care. Imaging algorithms vary depending on the suspected pathological conditions. Dynamic bolus-enhanced CT is the modality of choice in most situations. Tc99m sulfur-colloid liver-spleen scans are helpful in patients with suspected FNH, and Tc99m-tagged-RBC-SPECT scans are recommended to confirm cavernous hemangiomas. Cysts are easily confirmed by US. Although MRI is competitive with CT, it has not become a primary modality because of cost, availability, patient selection and variability of scanner capabilities among the many manufacturers and models. It is hard to predict what future development of imaging techniques will bring. Many feel that significant advances have plateaued. Time and money will more likely be concentrated on improving image resolution, speed of scanning and ability to transfer this information to sites outside of the radiology department. In addition to faster scanning, we expect to soon have available safe intravenous and enteric contrast agents for MRI. Certainly this will lead to a new round of investigations to compare MRI with CT scanning.\r"

Its very wide distribution in the body and its activity in vitro indicate involvement in the metabolism of other biologically active peptides. The recent molecular cloning of the human enzyme confirmed the existence of a hydrophobic C-terminal peptide that forms the short transmembrane domain of this plasma membrane-bound enzyme. The much longer external portion contains two homologous active site domains but probably only one functional active center. Finally, in spite of the great progress made in studying angiotensin converting enzyme, there are many challenging problems waiting to be solved.\r"

Endothelium-dependent vasodilation has been demonstrated in conduit arteries in vivo and in the cerebral, coronary, mesenteric, and femoral vascular beds as well as in the microcirculation of the brain and the microcirculation of cremaster muscle. The available evidence, although not complete, strongly suggests that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by acetylcholine in the cerebral microcirculation is a nitrosothiol. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by bradykinin in this vascular bed is an oxygen radical generated in association with enhanced arachidonate metabolism via cyclooxygenase. In the microcirculation of skeletal muscle, on the other hand, the vasodilation from bradykinin is mediated partly by prostacyclin and partly by an endothelium-derived relaxing factor similar to that generated by acetylcholine. Basal secretion of endothelium-derived relaxing factor is controversial in vivo but is usually present in vitro. On the other hand, it appears that endothelium-derived relaxing factor mediates flow-dependent vasodilation in both large vessels and in the microcirculation in vivo. The generation and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor from endothelium may be abnormal in a variety of conditions including acute and chronic hypertension, atherosclerosis, and ischemia followed by reperfusion. Several mechanisms for these abnormalities have been identified. These include inability to generate endothelium-derived relaxing factor or destruction of endothelium-derived relaxing factor by oxidants after its release in the extracellular space. These abnormalities in endothelium-dependent relaxation may contribute to the vascular abnormalities in these conditions.\r"

Systemic hemodynamic data were measured with Doppler echocardiography from which the mitral flow velocity integral, cardiac index, and total peripheral resistance were calculated. The salt-sensitive patients in whom the increase in total peripheral resistance was greater than the increase in cardiac index with salt loading were termed SST. In the salt-sensitive patients termed SSC, the increase in cardiac index was greater than the increase in total peripheral resistance with increased sodium intake. All SST patients on day 7 of the high sodium diet remained in the SST group on day 14. Nine of 13 patients in the SSC group on day 7 remained in the SSC group on day 14, and the remaining four patients in the SSC group on day 7 fell into the SST group on day 14. Four of eight non-salt-sensitive (NSS) patients on day 7 of the high salt regimen remained in the NSS group on day 14, whereas the remaining four patients in the NSS group on day 7 fell into the SSC group on day 14. Our data suggest a changing pattern with sodium loading of initially high cardiac index followed by a persistently raised total peripheral resistance. The celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries vasoconstricted with sodium repletion in both SST and SSC patients. With salt loading, the terminal aortic vascular bed vasodilated in the SSC patients and vasoconstricted in the SST patients.\r"

Sixty-three subjects entered an initial 2-week familiarization period during which they continued their usual alcohol intake and commenced a \"low sodium\" diet (less than 60 mmol/day) supplemented with 100 mmol sodium chloride per day as enteric-coated tablets. Subjects were then randomly assigned to either drink a low alcohol beer alone for a 4-week period (reducing their self-reported alcohol consumption from 537 to 57 ml/week) or to continue their usual alcohol intake (543 versus 557 ml/week). Within the low and normal alcohol intake groups, subjects were assigned to either a low or normal sodium intake. The low sodium groups continued the sodium-restricted diet but were switched to placebo sodium chloride tablets for the 4 weeks. This resulted in a fall in the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion from 144 to 69 mmol/day. The normal sodium groups continued the low sodium diet but kept taking 100 mmol/day of the sodium chloride tablets, and their urinary sodium excretion remained unchanged (125 versus 142 mmol/day). Regular antihypertensive therapy was continued throughout. Fifty-nine subjects completed the trial. In those who reduced their alcohol intake there was a fall in both systolic blood pressure (-5.4 mm Hg supine, p less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (-3.2 mm Hg supine, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test the hypothesis that salt sensitivity in humans may be associated with abnormal acid-base homeostasis, we performed arterial blood gas analyses in young (20-31 years old) normotensive subjects (n = 40) who were placed on a low salt diet (20 mmol NaCl/day) for 2 weeks with either 200 mmol sodium chloride or placebo added to the low salt diet for 1 week each in a randomized, single-blind crossover order. Furthermore, a subset of the subjects (seven salt-sensitive and eight salt-resistant) received 200 mmol sodium/day as the citrate salt as a supplement to the low salt diet for a third week. During each regimen, blood pressure as well as arterial pH and bicarbonate levels were measured. Salt sensitivity was defined as a significant drop in mean arterial pressure greater than 3 mm Hg (mean of 30 readings taken during each diet, p less than 0.05) while the subject was on the low salt diet. According to this definition, 16 subjects were salt-sensitive and 24 salt-resistant. During the high sodium chloride regimen, arterial pH and bicarbonate levels were significantly lower in the salt-sensitive than in the salt-resistant group (p less than 0.0001). The increase in blood pressure caused by sodium chloride correlated inversely to the arterial pH (r = -0.57, p = 0.0002) and bicarbonate levels (r = -0.52, p = 0.0007) during the high salt diet. Sodium chloride increased mean arterial blood pressure in the salt-sensitive subjects; sodium citrate did not. Sodium citrate led to an increase in pH and bicarbonate levels in both groups. Our finding that a sodium chloride-induced rise in blood pressure is associated with lower arterial plasma pH and bicarbonate levels points to an abnormality in renal acid-base regulation in salt-sensitive subjects.\r"

However, information on these phenomena has largely been derived from analysis of short-term recordings taken in standardized laboratory conditions. In seven normotensive and 10 untreated mild essential hypertensive subjects, power spectrum analysis was performed on the intra-arterial blood pressure and pulse interval signal collected over a 24-hour period using the fast Fourier transform algorithm and splitting the recording into contiguous segments of 256 beats. About 70% of the segments were suitable for the analysis; the segments excluded for a nonstationary signal amounted to only 30%. All powers were characterized by a high segment-to-segment variability, but in each subject the mid- and high-frequency powers of diastolic blood pressure and the mid-frequency power of systolic blood pressure were markedly reduced during the night as compared with the daytime period, whereas the opposite occurred for the low- and high-frequency powers of the pulse interval. Over the 24-hour period, mid- and high-frequency powers of blood pressure were positively correlated to each other, but both accounted for less than 25% of the 24-hour blood pressure variance. No difference between mean normalized power values of normotensive and hypertensive subjects was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiovascular parameters were continuously monitored over 24 hours. Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were statistically different among the three groups both during the lights-on (rest) and lights-off (active) phases of the cycle with blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats greater than that of Wistar-Kyoto rats from Taconic Farms, which was greater than that of Wistar-Kyoto rats from Charles River. The largest difference in arterial pressure between Wistar-Kyoto/Taconic Farms and Wistar-Kyoto/Charles River was during the lights-on period. Heart rates of all rats decreased during the lights-on period; Wistar-Kyoto/Charles River had the largest decrease (-70 +/- 5 beats/min), Wistar-Kyoto/Taconic Farms had the least (-17 +/- 2 beats/min), and in spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease was intermediate (-29 +/- 3 beats/min). The pronounced diurnal variation in pressure and heart rate exhibited by Wistar-Kyoto/Charles River was not present in either Wistar-Kyoto/Taconic Farms or spontaneously hypertensive rats. Blood pressure magnitude correlated with locomotor activity during both periods, although all groups showed minimal activity during the rest period. Observed differences between Wistar-Kyoto/Charles River and Wistar-Kyoto/Taconic Farms were not due to a lack of or an abnormality in baroreceptor reflex function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In Brown Norway rats, urinary kinin excretion was measurable but extremely low when compared with control strains. The depressor responses to intra-arterial bradykinin injections 1) were not different between Brown Norway and Brown Norway-Hannover rats, 2) were potentiated by intravenous ramipril (60 micrograms), and 3) were attenuated by intra-arterial infusion of the bradykinin antagonist B4146 (40 micrograms/kg/min) to a similar extent in both strains. In renal hypertensive (two-kidney, one clip) Brown Norway rats, the blood pressure reductions to intravenous bolus injections of ramipril (100 micrograms) were significantly reduced both in extent and duration when compared with hypertensive Brown Norway-Hannover and Wistar rats. Intra-arterial infusion of B4146 (40 micrograms/kg/min) attenuated the depressor response to ramipril in Wistar and Brown Norway-Hannover rats but had no effect in Brown Norway rats. In contrast, all three groups showed similar depressor responses to intravenous infusions of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin. These responses were not influenced by the bradykinin antagonist. Our data support the hypothesis that kinins are important for the acute antihypertensive actions of converting enzyme inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "The renal and systemic changes after stenosis of the left renal artery (n = 5) or sham stenosis (n = 6) in conscious dogs were studied sequentially over 25 days. Stenosis produced a prompt rise in arterial pressure, which was at all times due to reduced peripheral vascular conductance, with no increase in cardiac output despite initial evidence of mild fluid retention. The decrease in peripheral conductance was attributable to 1) the stenotic kidney (25% of the total and due to the mechanical effect of the stenosis itself), 2) the nonstenotic kidney (about 15% of the total and not caused by angiotensin II), and 3) the nonrenal vasculature (60%). The decrease in conductance in the nonrenal vasculature was due partly to angiotensin II, but there was also a gradually developing non-angiotensin II component. Acute administration of captopril caused significantly greater changes in arterial pressure and peripheral conductance throughout the period of stenosis than before stenosis (and greater than in sham-stenosis dogs), indicating that angiotensin II was constricting the peripheral vasculature even when plasma renin levels were no longer elevated. In the stenotic kidneys, captopril produced a fall in renal vascular resistance, but renal blood flow did not rise because there was an approximately equal rise in the resistance of the stenosis. There was no evidence for a role for the autonomic nervous system in the hypertension, as ganglion blockade (pentolinium) had similar hemodynamic effects before and after stenosis. Thus, the hypertension was due at all times to reduced peripheral conductance, with the two kidneys responsible for 40% of this reduced conductance.\r"

Although calcium channel blockers effectively lower systemic blood pressure, their effect on glomerular capillary pressure and on hypertensive glomerular injury is uncertain. We compared equihypotensive treatment with the calcium antagonist TA 3090 or the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in post-salt hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats for up to 5 weeks after five sixths nephrectomy. Before the nephrectomy, all rats demonstrated hypertension (mean 177 mm Hg), proteinuria (mean 175 mg/day), and mild glomerulosclerosis (mean injury score 35). Rats treated with captopril or TA 3090 demonstrated a significant and equivalent decrease in systolic blood pressure compared with untreated rats at 2, 3, and 5 weeks after five sixths nephrectomy; however, only captopril reduced proteinuria. Final proteinuria was actually increased in rats treated with TA 3090 compared with untreated rats. Glomerular injury score was significantly decreased in captopril-treated compared with untreated rats at 2 weeks (33 +/- 9 versus 117 +/- 10, p less than 0.05) and 5 weeks (46 +/- 9 versus 94 +/- 24, p less than 0.05), whereas treatment with TA 3090 delayed but did not prevent progressive glomerular injury (2-week score 35 +/- 7, p less than 0.05 versus untreated; 5-week score 109 +/- 19, p = NS versus untreated). Thus, in hypertensive DS rats after subtotal nephrectomy, treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor reduced systemic blood pressure, proteinuria, and glomerulosclerosis. However, equihypotensive treatment with a calcium channel blocker did not reduce proteinuria and delayed but did not prevent glomerulosclerosis. Thus, in the rat similar reductions in systemic blood pressure with these two classes of agents have disparate effects on the progression of chronic renal failure.\r"

In the present study, we examined whether a possible racial difference in adrenal androgen production during adrenarche might contribute to the racial disparity in blood pressure. Adrenal androgen production was estimated from urinary excretion of adrenal androgen metabolites that showed cross-reactivity with antisera to dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). Urine samples were collected overnight in 798 children, one third of whom were black. Analyses were performed for two different age groups, less than 10 years and 10 years or more of age. In children less than 10 years of age, adrenal androgen excretion rates were 17% higher in blacks than in whites (p = 0.0099); adrenal androgen excretion rates tended to be higher in older black children as well, but differences here were not statistically significant. Adrenal androgen excretion rates were positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure in the older age group only (p = 0.014). However, when the relation of race to blood pressure was examined along with adrenal androgen excretion adjusted for age, sex, and weight, race remained an independent contributor to the level of blood pressure, suggesting that a difference in adrenal androgens could not explain the racial differences in blood pressure. In summary, black children produced more adrenal androgen, but this did not explain their higher blood pressures. In older children, where adrenal androgen excretion rates were higher, diastolic blood pressure and adrenal androgen excretion were positively related, suggesting that adrenal androgens participate in establishing the level of blood pressure in young people.\r"

Consequently, efforts were made to duplicate this finding. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (35 days old) were injected subcutaneously with 50,000 units/kg (3,500 units/rat) of recombinant interleukin-2 (Amgen) and had systolic blood pressure measured twice weekly by the tail-cuff technique. Systolic blood pressure in the interleukin-2-treated group was not significantly different from the vehicle-treated control group at any time point over 32 days of follow-up. A second injection of recombinant interleukin-2 (5,000 units/kg) was administered 32 days after the first injection. Again, no reduction in blood pressure was observed in the interleukin-2-treated group over an additional 38 days. Mean arterial pressure (+/- SEM) measured via intra-arterial cannula in conscious rats at age 105 days (38 days after the second treatment) was 168.5 +/- 3.5 mm Hg in interleukin-2-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats and 170.3 +/- 3.6 mm Hg in vehicle-treated controls. Both recombinant interleukin-2 preparations conformed to their respective manufacturer's indicated specific activity as determined by the ability of the interleukin-2 to induce proliferation of the interleukin-2-dependent cell line HT-2. Thus, this study demonstrated that interleukin-2 was ineffective in preventing or attenuating hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

These critical care nurse preceptors require educational preparation, continuing education, and support for their role. This descriptive correlational study surveyed 73 critical care nurse preceptors at 10 teaching hospitals in a metropolitan area in the Midwest. Forty-eight (65.8%) participants reported receiving some type of educational experience to prepare them for the role of preceptor. Only 24.7% of the respondents, however, participated in continuing education experiences related to the preceptor role. Job satisfaction was measured with a 48-item Likert scale developed for nurses by Slavitt et al. No significant differences in job satisfaction were reported for preceptors who received educational preparation and those who did not. However, the type of unit in which the preceptor worked did affect job satisfaction. Critical care preceptors in units classified as intermediate care and emergency departments had greater levels of job satisfaction than nurses working in intensive care units (t[68] = 2.52, p = 0.01). In addition, the longer the preceptor worked in critical care, the lower the level of job satisfaction (r = -0.210, p = 0.04). Job satisfaction was also influenced by the support preceptors received from their institution; a significant positive correlation was seen between this support and the level of job satisfaction. A description of the format and content of preparation programs for critical care preceptors was also provided as a result of this study.\r"

It was hypothesized that skin-to-skin contact, because of its soothing effects, would increase sleep, lower activity level, and reduce heart rate. Eight healthy preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit, who had reached 34 to 36 weeks gestation, experienced one session of skin-to-skin contact for an interfeeding interval. Observations were made once each minute using continuous videotape throughout three consecutive interfeeding intervals (before, during, and after skin-to-skin contact). Significant treatment effects were found by repeated-measures analysis of variance for behavioral state and activity level; pair-wise comparisons showed that quiet sleep frequency was significantly increased and activity level reduced during skin-to-skin contact. Infants had longer durations of quiet sleep during skin-to-skin contact. The Pearson product-moment correlation between heart rate and behavioral state was robust and generally linear, supporting use of heart rate as a measure of energy expenditure in these subjects. The findings suggest that skin-to-skin contact is a simple, cost-effective intervention that reduces activity and state-related energy expenditure.\r"

We asked nurses if the medical director or his or her designee (excluding residents) was available at night for triage, admission decision-making, and conflict resolution. In 21% (29) of the ICUs, nurses perceived no medical director at all. In the 54 ICUs with full-time medical directors, nurses in approximately 30% of the units said that there was no nighttime availability of the medical director or designee.

In this study the effects of different types of touch on nervous system arousal were examined in 59 adult patients who were receiving treatment for coronary artery disease. They were exposed to a standardized protocol that systematically varied the neural properties and procedural nature of the touch received. Measures of cardiovascular reactivity (heart rate and rhythm data as well as blood pressure measurements) and state anxiety were used as indexes of arousal. The results indicated that all types of touch evoked heart rate deceleration in contrast to both baseline and verbal conditions. However, there were no differential effects related to either the neural properties or procedural nature of touch. Diastolic blood pressure and state anxiety were also lower as a result of the touch. No changes were observed for systolic blood pressure or heart rhythm. In general, findings suggested that touch served to reduce arousal rather than to produce negative psychophysiologic consequences for recovery.\r"

  ".W": "The specific aim of this study is to compare and contrast the biophysical and psychosocial profile of men and women undergoing cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass graft and valve replacement) during the perioperative and home recovery period. Coronary artery disease appears to be qualitatively worse in women than men although the prevalence in women does not approach that in men until the seventh decade. Valvular disorders also reveal a different profile by sex with the greater valvular problems in women related to the fact that women have more rheumatic heart disease. A prospective, longitudinal design with a convenience sample of 117 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and their spouses (234 subjects) from five Northern California hospitals was used to tap patient response at three critical perioperative data points. Female patients were observed during the perioperative period to have significantly more shortness of breath, poorer cardiac functional status (New York Heart Association), significantly longer intensive care unit stays, and proportionately more deaths. At 1 and 3 months after discharge, however, their recoveries did not differ significantly from men's when they were compared on sexuality, recreation, or return-to-work variables. Surprisingly, female patients had significantly less mood disturbances as measured by the Profile of Mood States than their male counterparts, and they scored higher on measures of family satisfaction than did male patients. Implications of the study involve early recognition of heart disease in women, preparation of families for longer intensive care unit stays, and appreciation of different psychosocial responses to surgery.\r"

Analysis of family measures data (the Family APGAR, the Family Inventory of Resource for Management, and the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales) was combined with grounded theory method to assess family responses over time and recovery outcomes. Containment emerged as the major conceptual category of the grounded theory. Containment refers to a constellation of constructed meanings for events and behavioral responses used by families to regulate the impact of the surgical crisis and reduce family disruption. This \"contained\" coping pattern was manifested in families' avoidant behaviors and narrow definitions of the problem: that is, they defined their situation in terms of the surgical repair as cure rather than palliative intervention for a chronic, progressive disease. Situational factors such as the insidious development of the illness and the primary focus of care providers in the hospital on surgical care (allowing families' narrow definitions of their situation to remain unchallenged) also contributed to containment. Containment resulted in poor risk factor management as a major recovery outcome. Isolation and family conflict were evident throughout the recovery period. Concerns generated by continued evidence of morbidity during recovery contributed to a developing awareness of underlying disease, and diminishing containment when this growing awareness was openly shared within the family. Significant findings of the family measures analysis were compared with the grounded theory of the qualitative data. Each corroborated the other in key dimensions.\r"

After each call, nurses recorded detailed notes on the patients' progress and concerns. Content analysis of detailed nurses' recordings revealed the following predominant nursing actions: assessment, provision of support, reinforcement of predischarge teaching, referrals, and teaching. The five nursing diagnoses that occurred most frequently across the 8-week recovery period were altered comfort: pain; ineffective coping, individual; activity intolerance; sleep pattern disturbance; and altered nutrition. In response to these problems, patients managed and prevented health-related problems and engaged in health promotional and normalizing activities. By anticipating common problems in recovery, patients and care givers can be better prepared for going home. Similarly nurses can be better prepared to anticipate and respond to common recovery problems.\r"

A specific class of vasodilators, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, has recently gained predominance in the treatment of congestive heart failure. The primary mechanism of action is to reduce production of angiotensin II by competitive inhibition of the enzyme that converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II. Reduced levels of angiotensin II, in turn, promote vasodilation and lower aldosterone production. The benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in chronic congestive heart failure have been demonstrated by improvement in left ventricular performance, exercise capacity, functional status (using New York Heart Association classification), and survival.\r"

All patients were unresponsive to conventional resuscitative measures including an intraaortic balloon pump in 25 patients. Patients were resuscitated in the intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization laboratory, or the emergency department. Diagnosis varied from acute myocardial infarctions (12 patients), ischemic disease (15 patients), end-stage cardiomyopathy (7 patients), congenital heart disease (3 patients), or postoperative cardiac transplant graft rejection (1 patient). Three patients could not be resuscitated with ECMO because of low flow, but the remaining 35 (92%) achieved hemodynamic stability with ECMO flows greater than 2 L/min/m2. Duration of support ranged from 0.5 to 130 hours (mean 28 hours). Twenty-four patients were successfully weaned from ECMO support after coronary artery bypass (five patients), cardiac transplantation (two patients), or ventricular assist device insertion (eight patients), or with inotropic support (nine patients). Of the 14 patients not weaned, three were inadequately resuscitated, two had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty while receiving ECMO, and nine were not candidates for further intervention. Nine (24%) patients were discharged and are long-term survivors. Our results indicate that resuscitative ECMO is useful for intervals of 12 to 24 hours and can best be applied with (1) patients younger than 60 years of age; (2) patients having acute events (failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) amenable to surgical intervention; and (3) candidates for cardiac transplantation who could be switched to more sophisticated devices within 12 to 24 hours of ECMO insertion. With these criteria, ECMO, when used as a resuscitative system, can result in increased survival in selected patients with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.\r"

Although this and six other patients had no recall of pain, 63% of the sample rated their pain as being moderate to severe in intensity. In a subgroup of nine patients having cardiac surgery, mean morphine sulfate administration during the first three postoperative days was 14 mg/day. This group of patients reported a lack of total pain relief from analgesics. Patients also described various sources of their pain, difficulties they had in communicating their pain, and nonpharmacologic methods that helped relieve their pain. Results of this study clearly indicate that not only pain but its communication and treatment were significant problems for a substantial portion of this ICU sample. Further descriptive and experimental research of pain characteristics and treatment practices for ICU patients is urgently needed. Improvements in nursing practice that result from such research may make a substantial difference in the comfort and well-being of critically ill patients.\r"

If the patient's oxygen demand exceeds the supply, dysrhythmias, hypotension, altered level of consciousness, and other adverse responses can occur. We describe use of continuous monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) as a tool to assess the patient's supply/demand balance during nursing care. The physiology of oxygen transport is reviewed, and oxygen delivery, reserve, and consumption are defined. Conditions that decrease oxygen delivery and increase oxygen demand are discussed, and the effects on SvO2 are illustrated. With continuous SvO2 monitoring, critical care nurses can see the effect of their nursing care on the patient's oxygenation and can adjust their care according to the patient's tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this multisite study was to determine the effects of endotracheal suctioning on mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and heart rate in 189 critically ill adults. One-pass, intermittent suction was applied for 10 or fewer seconds, with three prehyperoxygenation and three posthyperoxygenation breaths of 100% oxygen. Subjects at three hospitals (n = 127) underwent suctioning using hyperoxygenation with anesthesia bags and traditional suction catheters (open suction method). Subjects at one hospital (n = 62) underwent suctioning with hyperoxygenation by ventilator and in-line suction catheters (closed suction method). For subjects from all hospital sites combined, the SvO2 decreased from 67% to 64% (p = 0.001), a 4% change from baseline, and returned to baseline within 2 minutes. However, in subjects receiving the open method of suction, SvO2 dropped from 66% to 62% immediately after suctioning and returned to baseline within 4 minutes. In contrast, when the closed suction method was used, SvO2 rose from 67.7% to 67.86% immediately after suctioning, drifting upward to 71% for the next 2 minutes before dropping toward the baseline after 4 minutes. Mean heart rate increased from a baseline of 99 beats/min to 104 beats/min immediately after suctioning (p = 0.001), a 5% change from baseline, and gradually returned to baseline over the next 4 minutes. No significant differences were seen in heart rate between subjects having the open versus closed suction method. In conclusion, the closed suction method showed a higher SvO2 after endotracheal suctioning compared with the open suction method (p = 0.0001). Some form of hyperoxygenation before and after endotracheal suctioning is recommended.\r"

These statistically significant changes in SvO2 and heart rate were not clinically significant for most patients. However, physiologic responses to turning were highly variable. SvO2 reductions of 25% or more from baseline, heart rate increases and decreases of 10 beats/min or more, and signs of activity intolerance occurred in some patients. Nurses should expect critically ill patients to have a decrease in SvO2 of approximately 9% of baseline and small changes in heart rate after turning. These changes should be transient, with SvO2 and heart rate gradually returning toward baseline levels during the next 4 minutes. If turning triggers large or prolonged changes in SvO2 or heart rate, prompt repositioning and evaluation are needed to prevent adverse effects.\r"

The back rub was the third and last intervention in a study conducted in intensive care units at four hospitals. For this multiple-intervention study all patients were placed in a supine position to obtain baseline SvO2 and heart rate, then underwent suctioning via endotracheal tube, and were turned to a lateral position. After 15 minutes in a side-lying position, the subjects received a 1-minute back rub. Data were collected immediately after the back rub and at 1-minute intervals for 4 minutes. After the back rub, SvO2 decreased immediately from the mean baseline of 67% to 63% and gradually increased, returning to baseline by minute 4. The mean baseline heart rate of 99 beats/min increased to 103 beats/min immediately after the back rub and gradually decreased after massage, but remained higher than baseline by minute 4. Although the findings were statistically significant (p = 0.0001), these minimal physiologic changes do not represent clinical significance. Based on the findings, the back rub, a traditional nursing measure that can provide comforting touch, represented a minor stimulus affecting heart rate and oxygen demands in most critically ill patients. However, because of the variability found in heart rate and SvO2, individual responses need to be assessed.\r"

In the first case, the patient had a problem with oxygen delivery. Continuous SvO2 data aided nurses in guiding, adjusting, and assessing therapy. The second case demonstrates how SvO2 monitoring can provide an early sign of a life-threatening complication. The final case is one in which the patient had a problem with oxygen utilization. In all the cases, continuous SvO2 data provided important information about the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization.\r"

The study was done from 4 to 8 hours after surgery in 34 patients after coronary artery bypass grafting. Subjects were put through a series of six position changes, including head of bed elevations and right and left lateral decubitus with return to supine between each. Each position was maintained for 30 minutes. SvO2, arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured before and after each position change. Overall mean subject data demonstrated a decrease in SvO2 with each of the lateral position changes. The SvO2 did not drop below 60% in these mean data, and this drop returned to baseline by 5 minutes. There were no significant changes in the mean data for VO2 or SaO2. No significant correlation was found in the mean data between SvO2 and VO2 or SvO2 and SaO2 measurements. Trends were demonstrated in five specific cases that suggested a correlation between changes in SvO2 and changes in VO2 and SaO2. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that subjects were able to tolerate position changes with no clinically significant changes in SvO2, SaO2, or VO2.\r"

The improved techniques included use of a medullary plug, a cement gun, a doughy mix of Simplex P and a collared stem of chrome cobalt. Only three femoral components had definitely loosened, none were probably loose and 24 were graded as possibly loose. In contrast, the incidence of radiographic loosening on the acetabular side was 42%. Improved cementing techniques have produced a marked reduction in the rate of aseptic loosening of the femoral component, but the incidence of acetabular loosening is unchanged.\r"

The incidence of radiographic femoral loosening (29.4%), symptomatic loosening (15.7%), and femoral revision (7.8%) were similar to those previously reported at 10 years for routine arthroplasties by Stauffer (1982). On the acetabular side, the incidence of radiographic loosening (52.9%), symptomatic loosening (27.5%), and revision (13.7%) were four to five times higher. We conclude that a history of prior acetabular fracture has a significant adverse impact on the long-term outcome of any subsequent total hip arthroplasty.\r"

These satisfactory results were achieved in only half the cases with a detached labrum, but in nearly all cases with normal or torn acetabular labra. Other factors such as the acetabular index, the level and angle of osteotomy, and the displacement following osteotomy did not affect the results. Chiari pelvic osteotomy is a worthwhile procedure for early osteoarthritis in selected cases, but a detached acetabular labrum increases the risk of clinical failure.\r"

In a multicentre international trial the device was shown to reduce post-traumatic and postoperative swelling; pain also was alleviated. Evidence is also presented that dangerously high compartment pressures may be reduced to acceptable levels and fasciotomy avoided. We present an explanation of the clinical effects of activation of the venous footpump, based on recent improved understanding of the physiology of the microcirculation. The hyperaemic response that follows the liberation of endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) by sudden changes of pressure after weight-bearing or impulse compression is particularly important.\r"

The movements were measured in three dimensions, using biplanar photography, when all the ligaments were intact, and then after the ligaments were sequentially divided. When only the anterior cruciate ligament was sectioned, the pivot shift occurred in seven out of 20 knees examined. In the other 13, though the pivot shift was not observed, an abnormal internal rotation occurred at between 10 degrees and 50 degrees of flexion. Division of the iliotibial tract in addition to division of the anterior cruciate ligament stopped the pivot shift, as the tibia remained internally rotated throughout the range of flexion. The axis of rotation of the pivot shift was located at the medial collateral ligament, which was kept tight by the applied valgus torque. The sudden movement in the pivot shift was caused by a complex interaction between the geometry of the knee and the valgus torque applied.\r"

The other experiments were similar, except that in the second, the periosteum of the segment was removed, in the third its medullary canal was blocked with a Silastic rod, and in the last group the segment was isolated from its muscle bed by a Silastic sheet. The reparative processes were quantified by estimating the resorption index, the cortical new bone formation index, the callus encasement index, and the osteocyte count. Bone resorption and apposition occurred in the segment even when the periosteum was absent or the medullary canal was blocked, with osseous union at both ends by eight to 12 weeks, provided the segment was not isolated from its muscle bed. Thus, the muscle bed played a significant role in these reparative processes.\r"

The plane of maximal arm elevation was shown to occur 23 degrees anterior to the plane of the scapula. Elevation in any plane anterior to the scapula required external humeral rotation, and maximal elevation was associated with approximately 35 degrees of external humeral rotation. Conversely, internal rotation was necessary for increased elevation posterior to the plane of the scapula. The observed effects of this rotation were to clear the humeral tuberosity from abutting beneath the acromion and to relax the inferior capsular ligamentous constraints. Measurement of the obligatory humeral rotation required for maximal elevation helps to explain the relationship of the limited elevation seen in adhesive capsulitis and after operations which limit external rotation.\r"

The animals were killed at intervals from three months to 27 months after operation, and the interface between the prosthesis and bone was examined radiologically, histologically and crystallographically. Bone bonding with the prosthesis had occurred in half the implants. It took at least one year for bonding to be complete, but an apatite layer on the surface of the prosthesis was observed as early as three months after the operation, suggesting the possibility of much earlier bone bonding if more rigid fixation of the prosthesis had been provided.\r"

  ".W": "We made a retrospective study of 149 children and adolescents with moderate spondylolisthesis (slip less than or equal to 30%), 77 treated by fusion and 72 conservatively at an average follow-up of 13.3 years. Both groups were fully comparable with regard to age at diagnosis, sex distribution (46% girls), and mean slip. The patients who were treated operatively had more pain before treatment and showed more initial progression of the slip. They had better clinical results and less pain at latest review, but the total progression of the slip over the whole follow-up showed no statistical differences between the two groups. Patients with a pseudarthrosis after attempted fusion had had a longer period of postoperative pain, but at the latest review had no more pain than those with sound fusion. None of those treated conservatively came to fusion later and the long-term results in 18 patients who had refused the advised operation were no worse than those for other conservatively treated patients. Our results suggest that a moderate grade of spondylolisthesis in adolescents usually has a benign course. It seems that spontaneous segmental stabilisation occurs as a result of degeneration of the disc at the level of the slip.\r"

  ".W": "A dual laser system capable of distinguishing atherosclerotic plaque from components of normal arterial wall was used to deliver laser energy to cut a channel through occluded vessels. This system was used to facilitate balloon angioplasty of short (3-17 cm) total occlusions of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries in 17 patients. In 10 patients the occluding lesion was traversed by the laser wire and patency was effectively restored by balloon angioplasty. Satisfactory luminal patency has persisted for 2 to 12 months (mean 6 months) in 9 cases; the lesion in the tenth patient restenosed at 3 months. The laser procedure was unsuccessful in all 3 cases with occlusions over 10 cm and in 4 others. There were no clinically important complications. This experience suggests that most patients who presently require interventional treatment can be managed by standard angioplasty methods and/or require a bypass operation. The \"Smart\" laser is safe and effective short-term in facilitating angioplasty in some patients in whom standard angioplasty techniques are not feasible. The implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91009445\r", 
  ".W": "From 1974 to 1988, interruption of the superficial femoral vein (SFV) was performed to prevent pulmonary embolism (PE) in 73 patients. The mean age of the patients was 62 years. Phlebography showed thrombi in the following localizations: calf veins (67.3%), superficial femoral or popliteal veins (56.6%), common femoral veins (19.5%) and iliac veins (2.7%). A floating thrombus in the popliteal or femoral vein was the main indication for surgery in 97.3% of patients. Pulmonary embolism had occurred in 76.7% and was associated with neoplasm in 13.7%. Ligation of the SFV was performed in 93 limbs and completed iliac or femoral thrombectomy in 32.3%. The procedure was performed under locoregional anesthesia in 82.9% of the cases. Hospital mortality was 1.4% and 3 year survival, considering only PE related deaths was 95.3 +/- 2.7%. Follow-up was complete for all patients and averaged 3.0 years, for a 3 years PE-free rate of 90.8 +/- 3.6%. Persistent symptoms included increased limb tenseness in 12.5% and mild ankle edema in 25%. Bilateral strain-gauge plethysmography (SGP) was obtained in 65 limbs. The time necessary to obtain a 50, 75 and 100% decrease in calf volume (respectively T1/2, T3/4 and TT) was calculated for the operated limb and compared with the untreated limbs used as controls. A prolongation of T1/2 from 2.5 +/- 0.3 sec in controls to 4.3 +/- 0.4 sec in the operated limb (p less than 0.01) was found. Thus, our experience with ligation of the superficial femoral vein is favourable since long-term ill effects have been minimal and strain gauge plethysmography (SGP) showed only mildly altered venous drainage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Angiographic defects were identified in 34 of 160 carotid endarterectomies (21%), of which 21 of 34 (65%) resulted in a greater than 20% stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). There were defects in 6 of 81 (7.4%) shunted vessels compared to 16 of 79 (20%) of those not shunted (p less than 0.05). Thirty-one vessels were reexplored 11 of 81 (13.5%) of those shunted and 20 of 79 (20%) of those not shunted (p less than 0.05). There were four strokes (2.5%) (2 in each group) and one death due to myocardial infarction (0.6%) in the postoperative period. Duplex follow-up from 1-60 months (median 22 months) was available in 114 of 160 (71%) endarterectomies. A stenosis of greater than 50% was detected in 7 of 114 (6%) carotid arteries; 5 of the 7 (71%) were shunted and 2 (29%) were nonshunted. Unrepaired defects were present in 3 of 7 (43%) and no defects in the remaining 4 of 7 (57%) arteries. We conclude that the use of a shunt significantly decreases the number of ICA defects detected angiographically and that immediate revision of demonstrable defects can be undertaken with low morbidity and does not predispose the patient to recurrent stenosis.\r"

To assess current morbidity and mortality, we reviewed 200 consecutive aortic resections in two groups of patients treated from 1981 to 1989: those undergoing elective aortofemoral bypass for occlusive disease (AFB, no. 100) or resection of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA, no. 100). Indications for AFB included claudication (54%), rest pain (32%), and gangrene (13%). AAA size ranged from 3 to 14 cm (mean 6.5 +/- 2.4 cm); 45% presented with abdominal or back pain. Patients undergoing AFB were younger (AFB 61.5 +/- 10 years vs AAA 68.7 +/- 8.9 years) with a higher incidence of some atherosclerotic risk factors, diabetes mellitus 30% vs 10%, tobacco use 77% vs 49%, hyperlipidemia 21% vs 7%; p less than 0.001). Coronary artery disease (CAD) was more prevalent in AAA patients (49% vs 34%; p less than 0.001). Postoperative mortality was not different in occlusive or aneurysmal disease (3% AFB vs 2% AAA), nor was the occurrence of serious complications such as myocardial infarction (2% vs 1%) or pulmonary embolism (2% vs 3%). Improvements in patient selection, perioperative care and surgical technique have lowered the mortality of elective aortic surgery. Given the current standard of care, an aggressive approach to AAA even in high risk patients is appropriate. The low morbidity of AFB for occlusive disease mandates a critical appraisal of less effective nonoperative therapies.\r"

A group of 67 patients had general anesthesia alone (GA), while in the group of 77 remaining patients, a combined epidural and general anesthesia (Epi-GA) was employed. The two groups were similar in regards to age, medical risk factors, preoperative assessment of cardiac and pulmonary function, and type of surgical reconstruction. There was no significant difference in the anesthetic, operative time, or operative fluid requirements between the two groups. There was a lower rate pressure product in the Epi-GA group during aortic cross clamping (P less than 0.05). More patients in the GA group required a prolonged ventilatory support (P less than 0.05) and a high parenteral narcotic administration (P less than 0.025) during the first 48 hours. While the mortality rate was similar for the two groups (3.0% for GA group vs 5.2% for Epi-GA group), there was a higher percent of postoperative pulmonary complications observed in the GA group (7.6%) compared to the Epi-GA group (2.6%). By facilitating early extubation and a decreased need for systemic narcotics in the early postoperative period, Epi-GA may be beneficial in the high risk pulmonary patient undergoing aortic reconstruction.\r"

Comparison of the actuarial survival curves for patients ahd the patency rates of SR in Groups I and II failed to reveal any statistically significant differences.

These aneurysms developed after primary revascularization procedures at a mean interval of 66 months (range 12 to 156 months); one recurred after reparative surgery. Forty-four FAAs (78.6%) were asymptomatic, whereas 3 (5.3%) were complicated by acute expansion and 9 (16.1%) by thrombosis. Host vessel degeneration was the cause of aneurysm formation in most cases. A history of hypertension was present in 30% of the patients. All anastomotic aneurysms were operated upon except for one small aneurysm that was asymptomatic. In 5 patients aneurysm resection was carried out on both sides. The surgical technique was endoaneurysmectomy in all the cases with insertion of an interposition graft in 48 cases, a fabric patch in 2 cases and prosthesis re-anastomosis in 5 cases. One case of peripheral embolization occurring in the early postoperative period was successfully treated and there was no operative mortality. In our opinion elective repair of these aneurysms should be recommended whenever possible because of their propensity to develop serious complications and the operative morbidity is low.\r"

A policy of management between the forward and base hospital surgical teams was introduced, observing the following broad categorizations: (a) assessment/referral, (b) assessment/fasciotomy/referral, (c) immediate operation/referral for further operation/review/management. Two types of incision were used to enter the popliteal fossa: (a) a medial incision and (b) a sigmoid posterior incision (which we now favor). The results of this strategy of management and operative technique (when compared with our previous experience within the same time frame) suggested an improved outcome. Fifty-four out of 60 cases had a satisfactory operative result with below-knee amputation being required in only four cases and higher amputations in two others. No operative or postoperative deaths occurred. The implementation of this \"vetting policy\" at the front line appeared to reduce the number of amputations and assisted the clarification of management criteria in assessing limb viability at the forward hospital when a large number of casualties were being received. Operative access using the sigmoid posterior incision was not associated with any complications, offered better exposure than the medial incision and was technically easier for the surgeon to perform.\r"

  ".W": "There is no consensus about the most appropriate management of the patient with intermittent claudication due to a superficial femoral artery occlusion. To evaluate the natural history of prosthetic above-knee femoropopliteal (AKFP) bypass, 200 operations for intermittent claudication were reviewed. One hundred AKFP bypasses were done with PTFE and 100 with dacron. In the 30 day postoperative period, four PTFE and three dacron grafts occluded without consequence and only one patient died. Analysis of results by the life-table method demonstrated statistically similar primary graft patency rates at five years (PTFE 65% SE +/- 6.5, dacron 57% +/- 6.2) and ten years (PTFE 31% +/- 18/9, dacron 32% +/- 13.2) (p greater than 0.10). Redo procedures (e.g., thrombectomy, angioplasty) were necessary on 21 grafts (12 PTFE, 9 dacron) and \"secondary\" patency rates at five years were 76% PTFE and 62% dacron; no grafts which required a redo procedure were patent at ten year follow-up. Major amputations during ten year follow-up were necessary in 16 (8%) patients; all amputations were in diabetic patients. Survival rates were 79% at five and 42% at ten years. An anticipated, the leading cause of death was cardiac related (25 patients); 28 (14%) patients underwent aortocoronary bypass during follow-up. A prosthetic AKFP bypass graft is a safe and durable operation which provides relief from the symptoms of intermittent claudication while allowing for the preservation of the saphenous vein for use later in the coronary or infrapopliteal circulations, should the need arise. These results indicate that the risk of amputation after AKFP is no greater than the natural history of untreated claudication; however, AKFP offers a significant improvement in life-style.\r"

Therefore, a prospective study of 200 patients undergoing cystoscopy was conducted to identify the incidence of bacteruria and factors associated with it, organisms involved and their antibiotic sensitivities. Positive cultures were found in 21%. The incidence was 64% in in-patients and 8% in out-patients. Positive cultures were found in 12% of patients who received antibiotics and 29% who did not. Four percent showed signs of bacteremia. The cultures identified both Gram positive and negative organisms; multiple organisms grew in 22%. Gram negative organisms were more common in in-patients. Candida grew in 8%. The Gram positive organisms were sensitive to ampicillin (92%), sulfatrimethoprim (75%) and cefazolin (60%); Gram negative to aminoglycosides (100%) and cefazolin (92%). In view of the unpredictable and multiple organisms, it is recommended that pre-cystoscopy cultures be performed and specific antibiotic coverage be based on the sensitivities.\r"

Emergency cross clamping of the descending aorta and haemostasis of the bleeding from osteal defects by tamponade with bone polymethyl methacrylate appeared the only way to control the life threatening haemorrhage.

  ".U": "91009458\r", 
  ".W": "Since April 1986, 40 total artificial hearts (TAH) were implanted as a bridge to transplantation in our institution. In an attempt to identify factors affecting survival of TAH recipients we reviewed our experience over 1000 days of mechanical support. There was no postoperative bleeding requiring surgery nor were there any clinical episodes of thromboembolic complications. Over a total functioning period greater than 3 years there were no mechanical failures in the driving system but one artificial ventricle had to be replaced because of mechanical dysfunction. Infections and multiple organ failure were the primary causes of morbidity and mortality during mechanical support. When the patients who underwent staged transplantation (no. 17) were compared with those who died during mechanical support (no. 23) there were no differences in TAH driving mode or hemodynamic variables between the groups. Although preoperative pulmonary, hepatic and renal functions were found to be similar between the groups, there were significant differences in the early evolution (3 days) of hepatic and renal functions following TAH implant (p less than 0.01). Urinary output was found to be the earliest variable discriminating recovery and survival (p less than 0.01). Finally, univariate analysis indicated age (less than 40 vs greater than 40 years) and modality of cardiac decompensation (acute vs chronic) as the most important factors affecting survival after TAH implantation. Since young patients (less than 40 years of age) with acute decompensation were successfully transplanted in 82% of cases while 100% of older patients with chronic decompensation died before or after transplantation, TAH should be advised in young patients with acute or chronic heart failure and in selected older candidates with recent, acute cardiac failure.\r"

Emergency repeat CABG operations have considerable operative mortality and poor postoperative functional results with the majority of survivors developing recurrent ischemic syndromes within a short period of time.\r"

  ".W": "Forty patients with complete atrioventricular canal (CAVC) underwent primary repair at Fukuoka Children's Hospital in Fukuoka, Japan, between August 1, 1981 and July 31, 1989. The age at repair ranged from 2 months to 6 years (mean 19 months); weight ranged from 2.3 to 22 kg. The surgical mortality was 2.5%. Justification for early primary repair was examined. Eleven patients underwent repair before 6 months of age (Group 1), 12 patients, between 7 and 11 months of age (Group 2), and 17 patients, after 12 months of age (Group 3). Degenerative changes in the atrioventricular valve increased significantly as age at repair increased (p less than 0.05 Group 1 versus Group 3). The incidence of residual mitral regurgitation tended to increase in the order of Group 1, 2 and 3, though the degree ranged from trivial to mild. Study of the left atrium/aorta ratio by echocardiography revealed that stable values of around 1.1 in Groups 1 and 2 and around 1.3 in Group 3 continued during the follow-up period of 3 years. Assessment of the diameter of the repaired mitral valve in the mean interval of 26 months in groups 1 and 2 revealed normal growth of the mitral valve annulus. The angle between the repaired mitral valve and ventricular septum, which can be affected by the growth of the ventricular septum, converged to normal range in the mean interval of 26 months. Postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance in Groups 2 and 3 was higher at 4.4 +/- 2.3 and 6.3 +/- 2.2, respectively, than in Group 1 at 3.3 +/- 2.2 (p less than 0.01 versus Group 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to determine the factors responsible for myocardial injury we assessed myocardial injury in 54 patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement. In all cases hypothermic cardioplegic arrest was induced. At 13 different times we measured the serum level of creatine-kinase (CK), myocardial bound creatine-kinase (CKmb), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH), glutamic oxaloacetic transferase (GOT) and myoglobin. The mean duration of ischemia was 52.6 +/- 16.2 minutes and the mean time of extracorporeal circulation was 85.85 +/- 20.25 minutes. By performance of a multiple regression analysis a significant correlation between ischemia and LDH and alpha-HBDH was found; CK, GOT, LDH and alpha-HBDH correlated with duration of extracorporeal circulation. In none of the patients was a low cardiac output syndrome observed. From our results we conclude that in our study myocardial protection was sufficient and therefore the detrimental effects of extracorporeal circulation were the determining factors of enzyme release.\r"

The actuarial survival of operative survivors at 9 years was 73.5 +/- 11.8%. There were 7 late cardiac deaths among a total of 12 late deaths. Eleven patients required reoperation (2.1 +/- 0.6% patient-year). In seven patients it was necessary for recurrence of tricuspid regurgitation; six of these had also a mitral prosthesis malfunction or a periprosthetic leak. Residual tricuspid regurgitation was judged as mild, moderate or severe in 29.9%, 11.9% and 4.3% of the patients respectively. De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty is the method of choice for mild and moderate tricuspid insufficiency; in selected cases, with a more severe degree of regurgitation, better results could be achieved with a different surgical approach.\r"

Eighteen (81.8%) were diagnosed intraoperatively during resuscitation or surgery for associated injuries, and four (18.1%) were diagnosed preoperatively with pericardial window. Eighteen were males and four were females. The median age was 40.14 years (range, 17 to 68). The tears were found at the following sites: left pleuropericardial (14/22 [64%]), diaphragmatic (4/22 [18%]), right pleuropericardial (2/22 [9%]), and superior mediastinal (2/22 [9%]). Associated cardiac injuries were found in only 5 of the 22 (22.7%); all of those patients died. The overall mortality rate was 63.6% (14/22).

We used a new method to quantitate synthesis of vasopressin in rats after 3, 7, and 14 d of hyponatremia induced by administering dDAVP (a vasopressin agonist) and a liquid diet. Vasopressin synthesis was completely turned off by 7 d. Vasopressin mRNA levels in the hypothalamus paralleled the reduction in synthesis and were reduced to levels of only 10-15% of the content in control rats. When hyponatremia was corrected by withdrawal of dDAVP, vasopressin mRNA slowly returned to normal over 7 d. The observation that vasopressin synthesis can be so completely turned off leads to several conclusions: under normal physiological conditions the neurohypophysis is chronically upregulated; there must be an osmotic threshold for initiation of vasopressin synthesis (and release); the large store of hormone in the posterior pituitary is essential for vasopressin to be available during times of decreased synthesis; and, finally, some nonosmolar stimulus for synthesis must be present during clinical disorders when vasopressin is secreted (and synthesized) despite hypoosmolality.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue injury has been linked to neutrophil associated hydroxyl radical (.OH) generation, a process that requires an exogenous transition metal catalyst such as iron. In vivo most iron is bound in a noncatalytic form. To obtain iron required for growth, many bacteria secrete iron chelators (siderophores). Since Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are associated with considerable tissue destruction, we examined whether iron bound to the Pseudomonas siderophores pyochelin (PCH) and pyoverdin (PVD) could act as .OH catalysts. Purified PCH and PVD were iron loaded (Fe-PCH, Fe-PVD) and added to a hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase superoxide- (.O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-generating system. Evidence for .OH generation was then sought using two different spin-trapping agents (5.5 dimethyl-pyrroline-1-oxide or N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone), as well as the deoxyribose oxidation assay. Regardless of methodology, .OH generation was detected in the presence of Fe-PCH but not Fe-PVD. Inhibition of the process by catalase and/or SOD suggested .OH formation with Fe-PCH occurred via the Haber-Weiss reaction. Similar results were obtained when stimulated neutrophils were used as the source of .O2- and H2O2. Addition of Fe-PCH but not Fe-PVD to stimulated neutrophils yielded .OH as detected by the above assay systems. Since PCH and PVD bind ferric (Fe3+) but not ferrous (Fe2+) iron, .OH catalysis with Fe-PCH would likely involve .O2(-)-mediated reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ with subsequent release of \"free\" Fe2+. This was confirmed by measuring formation of the Fe2(+)-ferrozine complex after exposure of Fe-PCH, but not Fe-PVD, to enzymatically generated .O2-. These data show that Fe-PCH, but not Fe-PVD, is capable of catalyzing generation of .OH. Such a process could represent as yet another mechanism of tissue injury at sites of infection with P. aeruginosa.\r"

Although reovirus type 1 is rapidly removed from systemic circulation by the liver and the lung, very few hepatocytes express reovirus antigen during infection. In intestinal cells, reovirus replicates selectively in the crypts. This site preference may be due to active cell proliferation in the crypts. We hypothesized that the state of the cell may affect virus replication and tested this hypothesis by using chemical and surgical means to increase hepatic mitotic activity. Adult mice were treated with carbon tetrachloride or surgical trauma, inoculated with reovirus type 1 intravenously, and subsequently killed. Virus antigen was identified using a highly specific immunohistochemical technique. Liver sections were stained using immunoperoxidase with specific rabbit antireovirus antibody. Hepatotoxin and surgical trauma increase reovirus antigen detection in both Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Only the sequential administration of CCl4 and virus caused mortality at doses sublethal for each alone. These data demonstrate a synergism between hepatic injury and reovirus which results in a significant increase in the magnitude of viral infection and contributes to mortality. Such synergism may be important in idiopathic liver disease.\r"

  ".U": "91009807\r", 
  ".W": "Many abnormalities in collagen have been reported in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, some or all of which have been attributed to increased cross-linking. Although recent work has focused on the role of glucose-derived collagen cross-links in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, relatively few studies have investigated the role of lysyl oxidase-dependent (LOX) cross-links. In the present study, LOX cross-links and nonenzymatic glycosylation were quantified in skin collagen from diabetic subjects. There was an increase in the difunctional cross-link dihydroxylysinonorleucine (DHLNL) as well as in one of its trifunctional maturation products, hydroxypyridinium. All other LOX crosslinks were normal. Nonenzymatic glycosylation was increased in diabetic skin collagen, and this increase was correlated with increases in DHLNL (P less than 0.001). The biochemical results were examined for correlations with clinical data from the same subjects. Increases in DHLNL content were associated with duration of diabetes (P less than 0.003), glycohemoglobin levels (P less than 0.001), hand contractures (P less than 0.05), skin changes (P less than 0.005), and microalbuminuria (P less than 0.01). In nondiabetic subjects age was not correlated with collagen cross-link content with the exception that his-HLNL increased with age (r = 0.79, P less than 0.02). In diabetic subjects, PA levels decreased with age (r = 0.51, P less than 0.02). With increased duration of diabetes, DHLNL content was increased (r = 0.55, P less than 0.003) and OHP was increased (r = 0.59, P less than 0.01), whereas PA levels were decreased (r = -0.48, P less than 0.04). Nonenzymatic glycosylation of collagen was also increased with increased duration of diabetes (hex-lys, r = 0.47, P less than 0.02; hex-hyl, r = 0.39, P less than 0.05). We conclude that: (a) lysyl oxidase-dependent cross-linking is increased in skin collagen in diabetes and (b) that these changes in skin collagen are correlated with duration of diabetes, glycemic control, and long-term complications.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrosis is a complex process involving an inflammatory reaction, fibroblast proliferation, and abnormal accumulation of interstitial collagens. Mononuclear cells are usually present in lung fibrosis. Activated monocytes and macrophages in culture have been shown to produce several growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells and a stimulator of collagen synthesis. We have studied the expression of c-sis/PDGF-2 mRNA in lung tissues derived from five patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and from four control individuals without IPF. Northern blot analysis of specimens obtained from four patients with IPF revealed the expression of the c-sis/PDGF-2 protooncogene. A control lung tissue without IPF did not express the c-sis protooncogene. In situ hybridization extended these studies demonstrating the expression of the c-sis mRNA in the five specimens with IPF but not in the four control specimens without IPF. The expression of c-sis mRNA was localized primarily in the epithelial cells. Invading alveolar macrophages also expressed c-sis mRNA. The expression of c-sis mRNA was accompanied by the expression of PDGF-like proteins in lung specimens with IPF but not in control lung specimens. These findings demonstrate the in vivo expression of the c-sis/PDGF-2 protooncogene and the production of PDGF-like proteins in the epithelial cells and macrophages of the fibrotic tissue. This localized and sustained production of PDGF-like mitogen may constitute an important contributing factor in the abnormal fibroblast proliferation and collagen production, events associated with pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

  ".U": "91009809\r", 
  ".W": "Many inflammatory processes are characterized by an early phase of neutrophil migration and a later phase of monocyte migration into the inflammatory site. Mechanisms that govern the transition between phases are the subject of these investigations. Acute lung inflammation induced by C5 fragments in the rabbit leads to an initial neutrophil influx and plasma leakage into the alveolar space, followed by monocyte influx that we have previously shown to be dependent on prior emigration of neutrophils. Neutrophil enzymes are known to cleave intact fibronectin into fragments that are monocyte chemotaxins in vitro. Accordingly, generation of appropriate fibronectin fragments in situ by proteolytic enzymes from infiltrating neutrophils might represent a potential mechanism for attraction of monocytes into the lung. The studies reported herein demonstrate that a 120-kD fragment of fibronectin containing the RGDS fibroblast cell-binding domain induced monocyte migration into the rabbit lung in vivo. Intact fibronectin was inactive. A significant proportion of the monocyte migration was neutrophil independent. Intact fibronectin was present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from C5 fragment-treated animals rendered neutropenic, but absent in lavage from normal C5 fragment-treated animals. Fibronectin fragments were present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from both C5 fragment-treated and control rabbits. In addition, the amount of fibronectin was significantly increased in lavage of C5 fragment-treated normal but not neutropenic animals. Monoclonal antibodies directed against an epitope of fibronectin containing the RGDS cell-binding domain significantly inhibited the C5 fragment-induced monocyte migration, but not neutrophil migration. These studies suggest that chemotactic fibronectin fragments may in part be responsible for the recruitment of monocytes into areas of acute lung inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Most HCO3- reabsorption in proximal tubules occurs via electroneutral Na+/H+ exchange in brush border membranes (BBMS) and electrogenic Na+:CO3=:HCO3- cotransport in basolateral membranes (BLMS). Since potassium depletion (KD) increases HCO3- reabsorption in proximal tubules, we evaluated these transport systems using BBM and BLM vesicles, respectively, from control (C) and KD rats. Feeding rats a potassium deficient diet for 3-4 wk resulted in lower plasma [K+] (2.94 mEq/liter, KD vs. 4.47 C), and higher arterial pH (7.51 KD vs. 7.39 C). KD rats gained less weight than C but had higher renal cortical weight. Influx of 1 mM 22Na+ at 5 s (pHo 7.5, pHi 6.0, 10% CO2, 90% N2) into BLM vesicles was 44% higher in the KD group compared to C with no difference in equilibrium uptake. The increment in Na+ influx in the KD group was DIDS sensitive, suggesting that Na+:CO3=:HCO3- cotransport accounted for the observed differences. Kinetic analysis of Na+ influx showed a Km of 8.2 mM in KD vs. 7.6 mM in C and Vmax of 278 nmol/min/mg protein in KD vs. 177 nmol/min/mg protein in C. Influx of 1 mM 22Na+ at 5 s (pHo 7.5, pHi 6.0) into BBM vesicles was 34% higher in the KD group compared to C with no difference in equilibrium uptake. The increment in Na+ influx in the KD group was amiloride sensitive, suggesting that Na+/H+ exchange was responsible for the observed differences. Kinetic analysis of Na+ influx showed a Km of 6.2 mM in KD vs. 7.1 mM in C and Vmax of 209 nmol/min/mg protein in KD vs. 144 nmol/min/mg protein in C. Uptakes of Na(+)-dependent [3H]glucose into BBM and [14C]succinate into BLM vesicles were not different in KD and C groups, suggesting that the Na+/H+ exchanger and Na+:CO3=:HCO3- cotransporter activities were specifically altered in KD. We conclude that adaptive increases in basolateral Na+:CO3=:HCO3- cotransport and luminal Na+H+ exchange are likely responsible for increased HCO3- reabsorption in proximal tubules of KD animals.\r"

We cloned the preproPTH alleles of a patient with autosomal dominant FIH and sequenced the coding regions, 5' flanking regions, and splice junctions. The putatively abnormal (based on previous linkage studies) allele differed from the other allele's normal sequence at only one nucleotide. This T to C point mutation changes the codon for position 18 of the 31 amino acid prepro sequence from cysteine to arginine, disrupting the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence. Because the hydrophobic core is required by secreted proteins for efficient translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum, the mutant protein is likely to be inefficiently processed. Indeed, in vitro studies demonstrated dramatically impaired processing of the mutant preproPTH to proPTH. In summary, we observed a point mutation in the signal peptide-encoding region of a preproPTH gene in one FIH kindred and demonstrated a functional defect caused by the mutation. Mutation of the signal sequence constitutes a novel pathophysiologic mechanism in man, and further study may yield important insights both into this form of hormone deficiency and into the role of signal sequences in human physiology.\r"

  ".W": "Autoantibodies present in the sera of patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) bind to the basement membrane zone of normal human skin and commonly recognize two epidermal proteins, the BP240 and BP180 antigens. Two BP antigen cDNA clones from a lambda gt11 human keratinocyte library have been identified on the basis of reactivity with a BP serum. The fusion protein (FP) produced by one clone immunoadsorbed autoantibodies, which specifically recognized the BP180 by antigen, showing no cross-reactivity with BP240 by immunoblot analysis. The FP produced by the second clone immunoadsorbed autoantibodies which specifically reacted with the BP240 epidermal antigen. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the BP180 and BP240 antigens are encoded by distinct RNA transcripts with lengths of 6.0 and 8.5 kb, respectively. Immunoblot analysis of the BP180 lysogen extract identified a 135-kD FP which was recognized by 7 of 16 BP sera and 7 of 8 herpes gestationis sera. A rabbit antiserum prepared against the lysogenic BP180 FP specifically recognized the BP180 antigen from human epidermal extracts by immunoblotting, labeled the BMZ by indirect immunofluorescence, and bound to human epidermal hemidesmosomes by immuno-electron microscopy. These results indicate that the BP180 antigen recognized by BP and herpes gestationis autoantibodies is a unique hemidesmosomal polypeptide, distinguishable from the BP240 antigen.\r"

After exposure to LPS (10 micrograms/ml) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 100 nM) for 12 h, these HIV-1-infected monoblasts accumulated 8-15-fold greater levels of IL-1 beta RNA as compared with their HIV-1-uninfected counterparts that were similarly stimulated. In contrast, levels of RNAs coding for monocyte-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) were elevated less than twofold in the HIV-1-infected cells as compared with HIV-1-uninfected cells after their stimulation with LPS and TPA. Inhibition of new protein synthesis did not block the marked accumulation of IL-1 beta RNA produced by exposure to LPS and TPA in the HIV-1-infected cells. Time-course experiments showed that the maximal levels of IL-1 beta RNA occurred at 12 and 24 h after LPS and TPA stimulation of the HIV-1-infected and uninfected U937 cells, respectively. Studies of stability of RNA using actinomycin D showed that IL-1 beta RNA was equally stable in infected and uninfected U937 cells after their stimulation with TPA and LPS. Taken together, our data show that HIV-1 infection markedly augments IL-1 beta RNA accumulation in stimulated monocytic cells, probably through increasing rate of transcription of IL-1 beta.\r"

We examined whether essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), which inhibits macrophage infiltration in glomerulonephritis, affects PAN-induced renal dysfunction. Both control and EFAD rats developed proteinuria that resolved over 28 d. After PAN administration, there was a prominent infiltration of macrophages in rats fed a normal diet. The infiltrate was prevented by the EFAD diet. The absence of a macrophage interstitial infiltrate was associated with a significantly higher Cin in the EFAD rats than in controls at 7 d (5.21 +/- 1.19 versus 0.39 +/- 0.08, P less than 0.002 ml/min/kg BW). In addition, CPAH fell to less than 10 ml/min/kg BW by day 7 in controls, but remained the same as normal in the EFAD. After administration of PAN to control rats, there was no increase in urinary thromboxane excretion or an increase in glomerular thromboxane production. Furthermore, the effect of EFAD could not be mimicked by the administration of a thromboxane synthase inhibitor. Irradiation-induced leukopenia in rats on a normal diet markedly improved glomerular filtration and renal blood flow in acutely nephrotic rats. EFAD prevents the interstitial cellular infiltrate and the renal ischemia associated with experimental nephrosis. The recruitment of mononuclear cells into the kidney following PAN directly contributes to the decline in renal function.\r"

We have recently generated a novel monoclonal antibody against a rheumatoid synovial T cell line that recognizes an antigen termed UM4D4 (CDw60). This antigen is expressed on a minority of peripheral blood T cells, and represents the surface component of a distinct pathway of human T cell activation. The current studies were performed to examine the expression and function of UM4D4 on T cells obtained from synovial fluid and synovial membranes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory joint disease. The UM4D4 antigen is expressed at high surface density on about three-fourths of synovial fluid T cells and on a small subset of synovial fluid natural killer cells; in synovial tissue it is present on more than 90% of T cells in lymphoid aggregates, and on approximately 50% of T cells in stromal infiltrates In addition, UM4D4 is expressed in synovial tissue on a previously undescribed population of HLA-DR/DP-negative non-T cells with a dendritic morphology. Anti-UM4D4 was co-mitogenic for both RA and non-RA synovial fluid mononuclear cells, and induced IL-2 receptor expression. The UM4D4/CDw60 antigen may represent a functional activation pathway for synovial compartment T cells, which could play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis.\r"

Molecular analysis of this abnormality demonstrated a deletion within the fifth intron of the c-sis gene. The normal c-sis gene has an Alu sequence in this region which includes two perfect 130 nucleotide repeated sequences separated by 5 bp. The deleted c-sis allele is missing precisely one copy of the 130 bp repeat and the intervening 5 bp. An identical deletion was also found in DNA from 1 of 13 sporadic meningiomas.\r"

  ".W": "Hereditary deficiency of complement component C3 in a 10-yr-old boy was studied. C3 could not be detected by RIA of serum from the patient. Segregation of C3 S and C3 F allotypes within the family confirmed the presence of a null gene for C3, for which the patient was homozygous. 30 exons have been characterized, spanning the entire beta chain of C3 and the alpha chain as far as the C3d region. Sequence analysis of the exons derived from the C3 null gene showed no abnormalities in the coding sequences. A GT-AT mutation at the 5' donor splice site of the intervening sequence 18 was found in the C3 null gene. Exons 17-21 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from first-strand cDNA synthesized from mRNA obtained from peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with LPS. This revealed a 61-bp deletion in exon 18, resulting from splicing of a cryptic 5' donor splice site in exon 18 with the normal 3' splice site in exon 19. This deletion leads to a disturbance of the reading frame of the mRNA with a stop codon 17 bp downstream from the abnormal splice in exon 18. His parents had both the normal and abnormal C3 mRNA and were shown to be heterozygous for this mutation by sequence analysis of genomic DNA amplified by PCR. Similar splice mutants have previously been reported in the beta-globin, phenylalanine hydroxylase, and porphobilinogen deaminase genes. This mutation is sufficient to cause the deficiency of C3 in the patient.\r"

To examine the mechanism of transcellular urea transport, membrane-apparent urea (Purea) and osmotic water (Pf) permeabilities of IMCD cells were measured by quantitative light microscopy in isolated IMCD-2 tubules perfused in the absence of vasopressin. Basolateral membrane Pf, determined by addition of raffinose to the bath, was 69 microns/s. Basolateral membrane Purea, determined by substituting urea for raffinose without change in osmolality, was 14 X 10(-5) cm/s. Bath phloretin inhibited basolateral Purea by 85% without a significant effect on Pf. The basolateral reflection coefficient for urea, determined by addition of urea in the presence of phloretin, was 1.0. These results indicate that urea crosses the basolateral membrane by diffusion, and not by solvent drag. In perfused tubules, the rate of cell swelling following substitution of urea for mannitol was significantly greater with bath than lumen changes. After correcting for membrane surface area, the basolateral membrane was twofold more permeable than the apical membrane. Conclusions: (a) in the absence of vasopressin, urea permeation across the IMCD cell is limited by the apical membrane; (b) the basolateral membrane contains a phloretin-sensitive urea transporter; (c) transepithelial urea transport occurs by movement of urea through the IMCD cell.\r"

This diet was imposed in 3-wk-old male weanling rats, and after 9 wk, enhancement of growth, characterized by increased wet weight, dry weight, protein content, and DNA content appeared. Morphometric analyses revealed increased kidney volume, tubular epithelial volume, and mean glomerular volume. There were no differences in nephron number. The animals on the deficient diet displayed increased urinary protein excretion at 9 wk. Renal injury was also characterized by an interstitial cellular infiltrate and diminutions in glomerular filtration rate. Enhanced growth and injury were antedated by increased renal ammoniagenesis. The deficient diet did not induce metabolic acidosis, potassium depletion, glucose intolerance, or elevated plasma amino acid concentration. Enhancement of renal growth and ammoniagenesis by the deficient diet was not suppressible by chronic alkali therapy. Stimulation of renal growth could not be ascribed to increased intrarenal iron, induction of ornithine decarboxylase, or alterations in glomerular hemodynamics. Stimulation of renal ammoniagenesis by dietary deficiency of antioxidants is a novel finding, as is induction of growth and injury. We suggest that increased renal ammoniagenesis contributes to induction of renal growth and injury.\r"

A plasmid (pHS-2) isolated from arthritogenic Shigella flexneri strains had been shown to encode an amino acid sequence homologous to HLA-B27. Rabbit antibody to this sequence (pHS-2 peptide) strongly cross-reacted with B27 peptide and, to a much lesser extent, with Klebsiella nitrogenase peptide. Serum antibody levels to pHS-2 peptide were studied in 160 spondylarthropathy patients. 12 of 115 (10.4%) AS patients, 2 of 45 (4.4%) patients with Reiter's syndrome or reactive arthritis as well as 6 of 147 (4.1%) normal controls were shown to have elevated anti-pHS-2 peptide antibodies. Antibody levels to B27 and pHS-2 peptides were significantly correlated in 134 HLA-B27(+) patients (r = 0.333, P less than 0.001). 13 of 15 affinity-purified anti-B27 peptide antibodies from patients strongly cross-reacted with pHS-2 peptide, whereas only 3 weakly cross-reacted to nitrogenase peptide. Leucine appeared to be a critical residue for this cross-reaction. AS patients' anti-B27 peptide antibodies reacted with HLA-B27 transfected L cells. These results may suggest that pHS-2 peptide more efficiently \"mimics\" B27 peptide than does nitrogenase peptide. Involvement of pHS-2 in pathogenesis of spondylarthropathy through molecular mimicry mechanisms requires further study.\r"

Rest tension, developed tension, intracellular potential, 42K+ efflux, lactate production, exogenous glucose utilization, and tissue high-energy phosphate levels were measured during a 50-min period of hypoxia with 4, 5, or 50 mM glucose present (isosmotically balanced with sucrose) and during reoxygenation for 60 min with perfusate containing 5 mM glucose/45 mM sucrose. At physiologic (4 or 5 mM) and supraphysiologic glucose (50 mM), lactate production and high-energy phosphate levels during hypoxia were equally well maintained, yet cardiac dysfunction was markedly attenuated by 50 mM glucose. Despite identical rates of total glycolytic flux, exogenous glucose utilization was enhanced by 50 mM glucose so that tissue glycogen levels remained normal during hypoxia, whereas glycogen became depleted with 4 or 5 mM glucose present during hypoxia. Most of the beneficial effects of 50 mM glucose occurred during the first 25 min of hypoxia. Prior glycogen depletion had no deleterious effects during hypoxia with 50 mM glucose present, but exacerbated cardiac dysfunction during hypoxia with 5 mM glucose present. These findings indicate that enhanced utilization of exogenous glucose improved cardiac function during hypoxia without increasing total glycolytic flux or tissue high-energy phosphate levels, suggesting a novel cardioprotective mechanism.\r"

The contribution of polyclonal activation to the progression of autoimmunity is unclear, however, since it precedes the development of end-organ damage by months or years. To examine this issue, 109 autoimmune-prone (NZB X NZW)F1 X NZB backcross mice were hemi-splenectomized at 10 wk and the number and antigenic specificity of their Ig-secreting B cells quantitated by ELISA spot assay. Of the 61 mice that had polyclonally increased numbers of Ig-secreting cells/spleen, 31 died by 6 mo. In contrast, 0/48 backcross mice with normal numbers of Ig-secreting B cells at 10 wk died over the same period (P less than 0.001). Polyclonally activated mice also developed proteinuria earlier and more frequently than littermates with normal numbers of Ig-secreting cells (P less than 0.001). As adults, backcross mice with proteinuria expressed repertoires skewed towards the production of anti-DNA antibodies. At 10 wk these same mice expressed repertoires marked by polyclonal activation rather than preferential anti-DNA production. These findings indicate that autoimmune disease in SLE is accompanied by the autoantigen-driven production of autoantibodies but is preceded and predicted by polyclonal B cell activation.\r"

Because of the high frequency with which mutations in ras protooncogenes have been detected in human tumors, as well as evidence linking ras gene products to activation of certain cellular functions, we investigated whether ras mutations might influence the regulation of cytokine genes. Normal human fibroblasts transfected with a mutant val12 H-ras oncogene expressed increased levels of mRNA transcripts encoding granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), and IL-1 beta compared with controls. Human mesothelioma cells transfected with a mutant asp12 N-ras oncogene exhibited similar alterations in cytokine gene expression. Estimates of transcriptional activity by nuclear run-on analysis revealed a selective increase in transcription only for the IL-1 gene. Analysis of mRNA half-life demonstrated a marked increase in the stability of numerous cytokine transcripts, including G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1, and IL-6. The addition of anti-IL-1 neutralizing antibody to cultures of cells expressing ras mutants did not block the expression of any of the cytokines examined, suggesting that the baseline expression of GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-6 was not a secondary event due to the increased transcription of IL-1. These results indicate that mutations in ras genes may alter expression of several cytokine genes through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.\r"

After an experimental period of 25 d (from 105 to 129 d of gestation, term = 145 d), the right (deflated) lung was significantly hypoplastic and contained less DNA than the controls; 175.15 +/- 55.18 vs. 346.77 +/- 61.97 mg, respectively; P less than 0.001.

Biochemical indices of lung maturation, including total phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, and disaturated phosphatidylcholine content expressed per unit of tissue DNA, were no different when comparing the hypoplastic, hyperplastic, and control lungs. These findings demonstrate that fetal lung cell multiplication is influenced by local distension with lung fluid, while the biochemical maturation of fetal lung surfactant is under systemic control.\r"

  ".W": "While both dobutamine and pacing tachycardia augment left ventricular (LV) contractility, whether overall cardiovascular response to these stimuli is comparable is not known. To address this question we studied seven dogs previously instrumented with three LV diameter gauges and LV pressure manometers. After ganglionic blockade and sedation, caval occlusions were performed at heart rates of 120, 160, and 200 bpm before (C), and 160 and 200 bpm after administration of 10 micrograms/kg per min dobutamine, i.v. (D). The effective arterial elastance (Ea) went up from 14.2 +/- 4.5 mmHg/ml at C120 to 19.6 +/- 8.8 (P less than 0.025 vs C120) and 24.2 +/- 10.4 (P less than 0.001 vs C120) mmHg/ml at C160 and C200. Ees, the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, increased with pacing from 9.7 +/- 4.6 to 11.7 +/- 4.3 (P less than 0.02), and 13.2 +/- 5.7 (P less than 0.02) mmHg/ml at 160 and 200 bpm. With dobutamine infusion Ea went down, and Ees was further increased to 37.0 +/- 20.9 mmHg/ml at 160 bpm (P less than 0.002 vs C160), and 53.0 +/- 22.6 mmHg/ml at 200 bpm (P less than 0.002 vs C200). Comparison of stroke work and pressure-volume area from single beats with matched LV end-diastolic volumes showed that these were both increased by dobutamine, but not by pacing tachycardia. While increased heart rate after dobutamine markedly increased contractility, Ea was not changed, and neither stroke work nor pressure-volume was further increased. Thus, how well an increase in contractility is transmitted to the periphery is determined in part by arterial behavior. Assessment of both the arterial system and cardiac contractility is necessary to fully evaluate the overall impact of an inotropic stimulus.\r"

Immunohistochemical techniques and Western blot analysis were used to determine the localization and isoforms of N-CAM in the developing and extrinsically denervated human heart. Myocardial and conducting cells in the fetal heart (7-24 wk gestation) exhibited sarcolemmal immunoreactivity, the major desialo N-CAM isoforms being 150, 145, 120, 115, and 110 kD. N-CAM expression appeared to be downregulated in the myocardium during adult life, with relatively little sarcolemmal immunoreactivity being detected in normal donor tissues. In contrast to the temporal changes observed in the myocardium, both the developing and mature cardiac innervation displayed N-CAM immunofluorescence staining, localized to neuronal cell bodies, nerve fascicles and fibres. Extrinsically denervated cardiac allografts, obtained 2 d to 91 mo after transplantation, showed extensive sarcolemmal and intercalated disc immunostaining and expression of 125-, 120-, and 115-kD isoforms. Tissues from explanted recipient hearts and atrial appendage samples obtained during coronary bypass graft operations were also examined and displayed varying amounts of N-CAM immunoreactivity. We conclude that the expression of N-CAM immunoreactivity and isoforms in the human heart is developmentally regulated and may be modulated by factors such as cardiac innervation and myocardial hypertrophy.\r"

In the present study, using antibodies to synthetic peptides and a polyclonal antiserum to the purified protein, we show that the 70-kD protein of the Ku complex is present in isolated plasma membranes of human cells. By indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescein-activated cell sorting, we demonstrate that this autoantigen is exposed on the cell surface. In addition, we have identified several domains of the protein that are exposed. Our study provides one of the first demonstrations of a eukaryotic, nuclear DNA-binding protein that is also on the cell membrane. Moreover, our results might help explain how autoantibodies to the Ku autoantigen could target cells for an autoimmune attack.\r"

Skin fibroblasts with fully upregulated LDL receptors from the latter subjects degraded rabbit 125I-beta VLDL in vitro at rates ranging from less than 10-48% of normal. Experiments in vivo revealed no significant differences between the normal and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemic (FHH) subjects in chylomicron remnant clearance assessed on the basis of \"areas under the curves\" for retinyl palmitate levels present in post-prandial serum, chylomicron remnants (Sf. less than 1,000), or chylomicrons (Sf. greater than 1,000). Remnant clearance was greatly decreased at all times in the apo E2/2 homozygotes, indicative of an important degree of flux control exerted by a receptor-mediated step involving apo E as ligand. The absence of any excess remnant accumulation in FHH subjects with varying \"impairment\" of LDL receptor-mediated degradation of apo E-containing lipoproteins, permits the conclusion that chylomicron remnants are initially cleared from the plasma by apo E-recognizing receptors which are genetically distinct from LDL receptors.\r"

PTH mRNA levels were increased by 3 wk of calcium deficiency (five times), a vitamin D-deficient diet (two times), and combined deficiency (10 times), but not changed by high calcium. Vitamin D-deficient-diet rats' PTH mRNA did not decrease after a single large dose of 1,25(OH)2D3, but did decrease partially after repeated daily doses of 1,25(OH)2D3. Rats after a vitamin D-, calcium-deficient (-D-Ca) diet did not respond to changes in serum calcium at 1 h. Flow cytometry of isolated cells from parathyroid-thyroid tissue separated the smaller parathyroid from the larger thyroid cells and allowed an analysis of parathyroid cell number. In normal vitamin D/normal calcium (NDNCa) rats the parathyroid cells were 24.7 +/- 3.4% (n = 6) of the total cell number, whereas in -D-Ca rats they were 41.8 +/- 6.6% (n = 6) (P less than 0.05).

Moreover, a calcium-deficient, more so than a vitamin D-deficient diet, amplifies the expression of the PTH gene, and vitamin D is necessary for an intact response of PTH mRNA to 1,25(OH)2D3 or calcium.\r"

This polymorphism was used as a marker genotype in a study involving 80 healthy subjects, whose serum ACE levels were concomitantly measured. Allele frequencies were 0.6 for the shorter allele and 0.4 for the longer allele. A marked difference in serum ACE levels was observed between subjects in each of the three ACE genotype classes. Serum immunoreactive ACE concentrations were, respectively, 299.3 +/- 49, 392.6 +/- 66.8, and 494.1 +/- 88.3 micrograms/liter, for homozygotes with the longer allele (n = 14), and heterozygotes (n = 37) and homozygotes (n = 29) with the shorter allele. The insertion/deletion polymorphism accounted for 47% of the total phenotypic variance of serum ACE, showing that the ACE gene locus is the major locus that determines serum ACE concentration. Concomitant determination of the ACE genotype will improve discrimination between normal and abnormal serum ACE values by allowing comparison with a more appropriate reference interval.\r"

This study examines recipient T cells for increases in intracellular ionized calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) after binding the T cell receptor-CD3 complex with anti-CD3 MAb. PBL from 10 of 23 short-term recipients (less than 1 yr after BMT) responded poorly (less than 35% of control) to anti-CD3 stimulation and PBL from 9 of 23 had blunted calcium flux responses (35-70% of control). Purified CD2+, CD56- cells from seven additional short-term recipients including three autologous marrow recipients were closely examined, and a sizable proportion of CD3+ cells from six of seven recipients did not increase [Ca2+]i after anti-CD3 stimulation. The decreased magnitude of the responses was due to decreased numbers of responding cells and not to a decrease in mean CD3 fluorescent intensity or in calcium flux responses on a single cell basis. Five of seven long-term recipients (greater than 1 yr after BMT) had PBL that responded normally and two of seven had PBL with blunted calcium flux responses. The data show that the signal transduction response mediated by the CD3-antigen receptor as measured by calcium flux is defective early after autologus or allogeneic BMT.\r"

Samples were collected from euvolemic Munich-Wistar rats by free-flow micropuncture; ANG concentrations were measured by RIA. In one group of rats, concentrations of total immunoreactive ANG (reflecting ANG II and lesser amounts of three fragments) in GF and E, M, and L PT fluid averaged 29-40 nM compared with 32 pM in systemic plasma. In a second group, immunoreactive ANG concentrations in SVP also exceeded systemic levels by a factor of 1,000. In a final group, samples of GF and LPT fluid were purified by HPLC before RIA to measure ANG II and III concentrations specifically: their respective concentrations were 6-8 nM and 14-25 nM. We interpret these results to indicate that substantial amounts of ANG peptides are released into or generated within intrarenal fluid compartments, in which local ANG is likely to effect regulation of renal function independently of systemic ANG.\r"

EBV DNA was detected in seven patients by Southern blot analysis (EBV Bam HI W probe, Bam HI). A germline configuration was found for the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes (JH probe, Bam HI and Eco RI; C kappa probe, Bam HI; and C lambda probe, Eco RI). T cell receptor gene rearrangements were detected with J gamma and J beta 1 + 2 probes. Using a J gamma probe with two different restriction enzymes (Bgl II and Eco RI), the blood from each patient showed several bands corresponding to the polyclonal pattern previously described in the blood of normal individuals. Using J beta 1 + 2 probes with two different restriction enzymes (Bgl II and Bam HI), each case showed from 3 to about 12 extragermline bands of varying intensity and in different locations from case to case. In addition, each case showed relative deletion of the J beta 1 germline band. This oligoclonal pattern of T cell receptor gene rearrangements has not been previously reported in benign or malignant T cell populations.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we used mRNA phenotyping to detect in megakaryocytes the presence of mRNA transcripts specific for various proteins. Our results indicate that megakaryocytes synthesize platelet factor 4, a protein relatively specific for platelets, but do not express mRNA transcripts for the fibrinogen, albumin, or IgG found in alpha-granules. We have previously shown that megakaryocytes endocytose circulating proteins, including fibrinogen, albumin, and IgG, and incorporate them into alpha-granules. Thus, platelets appear to contain a unique type of secretory granule whose contents originate by both endogenous synthesis and endocytosis from plasma. Under basal conditions, the source of alpha-granule fibrinogen is plasma.\r"

In each case the lymphoma had a diffuse pattern and mature B cell phenotype. The malignant cells were of uniform cell type, slightly larger than admixed polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and showed minimal nuclear irregularity and positivity for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Their clinical and morphological features were compared with those of other lymphoproliferative disorders, but while sharing some features in common with each condition, this small group of patients seemed to have a unique combination of findings. The cytopenias of all four responded well after removal of the spleen and their disease has not been aggressive. It is concluded that these patients have a distinct subgroup of lymphoma, which it is important to recognise so that inappropriate use of aggressive cytotoxic drugs can be avoided.\r"

All mast cell subtypes--that is, normal and reactive mast cells, such as those in lymph nodes exhibiting chronic non-specific lymphadenitis, and malignant or neoplastic mast cells in various types of mastocytosis--reacted with this antibody. This finding is of diagnostic importance, because mast cell proliferation could be mistaken for histiocyte proliferation.

The bone marrow cells were identified easily and reliably with AgNOR staining and the method was especially useful for lymphocytes, plasma cells, erythroid cells, basophils/mast cells, monocytes and cells containing haemosiderin. The immature haemopoietic cells exhibited more and larger AgNORs than the more mature cells.

The predominance of vimentin and the additional expression of cytokeratin subtypes 8 and 18, as well as the negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, accorded with results previously reported, for ovarian granulosa cell tumours; the lack of expression of desmoplakin, however, was a distinctive feature. Together with negative staining for leucocyte common antigen, the antigen pattern facilitates the differential diagnosis between granulosa cell tumour and undifferentiated carcinoma or gonadal lymphoma, although its suitability for differentiating within the group of gonadal stromal tumours seems to be limited. The small growth fraction, shown by the monoclonal antibody Ki-67, is typical of the clinical behaviour of granulosa cell tumours. The expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, also recently found in testicular Leydig cell tumours, may provoke new approaches to the management of testicular granulosa cell tumours, as well as a new hypothesis on the development of these tumours.\r"

Sigmoid biopsy specimens from 15 subjects with polyps and 15 age and sex matched controls were labelled and the incorporated Brdu visualised with an immunohistochemical technique. Mean labelling index (LI) was significantly higher in those with polyps than in controls. Differences in the pattern of labelling in colonic crypts were compared by the generation of cumulative labelling distributions. Analysis showed a significant expansion of the proliferative compartment in the colon crypts of those with polyps.

There was no correlation between the antibody concentrations in the EIA and the spread of chlamydial infection, as determined by cervical, endometrial, and laparoscopic sampling for chlamydia. The immunoblot analysis showed antibodies to the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of C trachomatis elementary bodies in all patients who had had C trachomatis isolated. Reactivity was also frequently observed against the 68, 62, 60, 45, and 31 kilodalton antigens. About 20 antigenic polypeptides were identified. Differences in antibody prevalence to specific chlamydial antigens, however, were not related to the site of chlamydial isolation or serum antibody concentrations observed with the EIA. The results indicate that patients with PID with and without upper genital tract infection with C trachomatis cannot be differentiated by reactivity of sera to specific chlamydial polypeptide antigens. The determination of a specific serum IgA antibody response by EIA was the most effective single test to discriminate between patients with and without acute chlamydial infection.\r"

Forty four were initially colonised with Helicobacter pylori. The indices were measured before treatment (in 71 children), one month (in 41 children), and six months (in 21 children) after stopping treatment. Before treatment there was a significant correlation between serum pepsinogen concentration, total inflammatory score, and H pylori state, but no correlation between serum gastrin concentrations and H pylori state. Similarly, the total inflammatory score and serum pepsinogen concentrations were significantly correlated. There was no such correlation in children negative for H pylori. After treatment the inflammatory score improved in those patients in whom H pylori had been eradicated. There was also a significant fall in serum pepsinogen I and serum gastrin concentration in those patients in whom H pylori had been eradicated. These results were similar to those found six months after treatment had been stopped. These findings suggest that the serum pepsinogen I concentration could be considered a useful marker for gastritis and can be used as an index of severity of gastritis in H pylori positive subjects. The measurement of serum gastrin concentrations does not give useful information.\r"

The urea disc method was more sensitive for detecting urease activity in isolates of Klebsiella species, Morganella morganii, and Yersinia enterocolitica. It also overcame the problem associated with the other two media of diffusion of alkali end products through the medium.\r"

Good assay reproducibility was obtained by the use of logarithmic phase cultures standardised by opacity, careful inoculation of well-plates, removal of antibiotic by membrane transfer and incubating survival counts in hydrogen plus carbon dioxide. The use of 10-fold intervals for penicillin concentration simplified assay design without loss of efficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Six hundred and sixteen blood samples from patients with haematological malignancy were each distributed equally among three identical cells in a Malthus Microbiological Growth Analyser. The mean (SD) volumes inoculated into sets in which one, two, or three of the three bottles were positive were 37.7 (10.1) ml, 37.4 (12.9) ml, and 37.7 (10.5) ml, respectively. Overall, clinically important organisms were isolated from one bottle only with 18 cultures, from two bottles only with 19 cultures, and from all three bottles in a set with 104 cultures. If the yield from a single bottle inoculated with a mean volume of 12.6 ml blood is taken as 100%, the yield from 25.2 ml in two bottles was 110.7% and the yield from 37.7 ml in three bottles was 115.6%. The increased yield from increased volume was considerably lower than that reported from unselected groups of patients, which suggests that the magnitude of bacteriaemia is greater in patients with neutropenia. The isolation of infecting organisms from the blood of patients with neutropenia is, however, particularly important in directing chemotherapy and consequently 45 ml blood samples from these patients continue to be requested.\r"

The borrelial spirochete and Lyme disease are the subject of this review. A subsequent article will review other definite and possible cutaneous manifestations of borreliosis.\r"

  ".U": "91009984\r", 
  ".W": "Cultured epidermal sheets were examined before and at various times after grafting on skin ulcer beds. Before grafting, the sheet consisted of four to five layers of keratinocytes with incomplete differentiation. Ten days after grafting, graft recipient sites showed compact hyperkeratosis, a normal-appearing epidermis, and a flat dermoepidermal junction. At 6 months, the stratum corneum had a basket-weave appearance but the dermoepidermal junction remained flat. Monoclonal antibodies to keratins 14 and 10 showed normal basal and suprabasal localization, respectively. Electron microscopy showed a normal basement membrane with anchoring fibrils. LH7:2, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the type VII collagen molecule, stained the dermoepidermal junction in all biopsy specimens. AE-1, an antibody that stains suprabasal cells in hyperproliferative skin, was expressed suprabasally for up to 12 weeks after healing (16 weeks after grafting), but expression was confined to the basal layer at 18 weeks after healing (6 months after grafting). Anti-involucrin staining was found in the deeper layers of the epidermis up to 12 weeks after healing (16 weeks after grafting) but had receded to a normal distribution in upper spinous and granular layers at 18 weeks (6 months after grafting). Overall, the histologic patterns observed in recipient sites during the first 4 months after grafting resembled those observed for 10 to 14 days in newly healed epidermis and in hyperproliferative states such as psoriasis. In four sex-mismatched graft sites, specimens were reacted with a biotinylated probe to the Y chromosome by in situ hybridization. Lack of Y chromosome-positive cells suggested that host keratinocytes had replaced the allografts. Multilocus DNA analysis in one patient confirmed this observation. Our data suggest that an altered state of epithelial maturation persists for several months after culture grafting, with restoration of the normal pattern by 6 months. No differences were detected between autografted and allografted sites.\r"

Anticardiolipin antibody titer was significantly higher in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis type 1 than in those with type 2 or type 3. Occurrence of anticardiolipin antibody was significantly more frequent in patients positive for anti-nRNP antibodies, rheumatoid factor, or thrombocytopenia. In contrast, patients with proximal scleroderma, scarring, or esophageal hypomotility were positive for anticardiolipin antibody less frequently. These results suggest that anticardiolipin antibody might be closely associated with lupuslike clinical manifestations in a subset of progressive systemic sclerosis or definite progressive systemic sclerosis with thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid factor, or anti-nRNP antibodies.\r"
