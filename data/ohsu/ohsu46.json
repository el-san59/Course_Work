  ".W": "A retrospective review of elderly patients who received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) over an 18-month period found ECT to be safe and effective. Of the 1159 patients admitted to the psychiatric unit during this time period, 50 patients (4.3%) aged 61 to 88 received between two and 14 ECT treatments. Brief pulse current with bilateral electrode placement and electroencephalogram monitoring were used with each patient. A total of 46 patients (92%) were much improved after ECT. Of the four nonresponders, three terminated treatment prematurely due to increased confusion, and one failed to respond after a course of 12 ECT treatments. There were no medical complications related to the ECT. A mean of 4.93 months from the onset of symptoms until receiving ECT may be one factor in our better outcome compared to some recent studies where treatment was delayed. The exclusive use of brief pulse current and its resultant lower level of confusion also may be important.\r"

This absence of orderly recruitment was attributed to misdirection of motor axons during regeneration. Following median nerve section at wrist level, where the reinnervated muscles have more synergistic actions, orderly recruitment by size appeared to be re-established. Thus, the size principle of motor unit recruitment can be re-established after nerve section in humans, if motor axons innervate their original muscles or ones with closely synergistic functions.\r"

Multimodality evoked potentials study was performed on 22 of the polyneuropathy cases, five of the subclinical cases, and seven of the unaffected workers. The absolute and interpeak latencies of patterned visual evoked potential (pVEP) in both the polyneuropathy and subclinical groups were longer than in the normal controls. The pVEP interpeak amplitude was also decreased in the polyneuropathy cases. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), showed no difference of wave I latency between factory workers and normal controls, but prolongation of the wave I-V interpeak latencies was noted, corresponding with the severity of the polyneuropathy. In somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), both the absolute latencies and central conduction time (CCT) were longer in subclinical and polyneuropathy cases than in the unaffected workers and normal controls. From this evoked potentials study, chronic toxic effects of n-hexane on the central nervous system were shown.\r"

Tyramine infusion produced a statistically significant increase in systolic blood pressure (BP) in the autonomic neuropaths only (p less than 0.001). No change occurred in diastolic BP. Noradrenaline infusion produced a statistically significant increase in systolic BP in the normal subjects (p less than 0.01) and in the autonomic neuropaths (p less than 0.001). The increase in systolic BP in the neuropaths was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) than in normal subjects. Diastolic BP rose significantly only in the normal subjects (p less than 0.05). There was no change in heart rate in response to either agent. Thus super-sensitivity to noradrenaline occurred in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy indicating post-denervation hypersensitivity. Tyramine hypersensitivity also occurred indicating that denervation is not complete and suggesting dysfunction at a pre-synaptic level.\r"

Although about 150 cases in Japan, and several additional cases in other countries, have been clinically reported in the literature, the pathology has remained unknown because of the benign course of the disease. The first necropsy findings are reported, obtained from a patient with this disease, who died of lung cancer at the age of 38, 23 years after the onset of the disease. The lesions existed only in the anterior horns of the spinal cord at C5 approximately T1, particularly marked at C7 and C8, showing shrinkage and necrosis, degeneration of various degrees of large and small nerve cells, and mild gliosis. The pathological findings differ from those of reported cases of spinal vascular disorders, but some circulatory insufficiency in the territory of the spinal cord would seem to be suggested, although the underlying aetiology remains unknown.\r"

Our patients differed from those with generalised dystonia in that their disabilities were focal, activity-specific, and non-progressive. Because these disabilities represent entrained responses to peripheral stimuli, distinct from progressive dystonias, they may provide insights into control of fine limb movement and sensory triggers of abnormal movement.\r"

The patients were studied when immobile after 12-18 hours withdrawal from antiparkinsonian drug therapy (OFF) and when more mobile after drugs (ON). Subjects performed each movement separately (simple movements) and both movements either simultaneously or sequentially (complex movements). The duration of both movements and the time between the onset of each movement in the sequential task (interonset latency) were measured. The patients OFF therapy had longer movement times than normal for both movements; these improved after levodopa but still were not normal. When the patients performed complex movements there was an extra slowness, over and above that seen for simple movements, in both movements of the simultaneous task and in the second movement of the sequential task. In addition, the interonset latency in the sequential task was longer than normal. After levodopa there was a more striking improvement in the movement times of complex movements than there had been for simple movements. The interonset latency in the sequential task was shorter than before therapy though still was not the same as in normal subjects. It is suggested that the basal ganglia are not only involved in the execution of simple motor programmes, but also play some role in the superimposition and sequencing of motor programmes.\r"

Slight elevations of CSF LDH were observed in nonmalignant diseases, while marked elevations were observed in a considerable number of patients with bacterial meningitis. A sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 83% were calculated. In the 34 patients with leptomeningeal metastases from solid and haematological tumours, the LDH in lumbar and ventricular CSF were measured simultaneously. The lumbar CSF LDH concentration in patients with leptomeningeal metastases was about five times greater than that in the ventricular CSF. No relationship was found between the CSF LDH and histology of the primary tumour. A good correlation was demonstrated between the lumbar CSF LDH and the effected area of the neuraxis. Serial determinations of CSF LDH showed a relationship between level changes and responses to therapy or progression. The findings of this study indicate that measurement of LDH in CSF can be used as an adjunctive diagnostic test for leptomeningeal metastases and in monitoring the efficacy of treatment.\r"

No studies of the incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis were available for London or South East England but there is evidence that it is much the same as occurs in Ireland. In the age groups studied the United Kingdom-born children of West Indian immigrants had an incidence and prevalence of probable multiple sclerosis of the same order as has been reported in Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic. Although there is evidence that genetic factors play a part, our findings are strong evidence that the cause of the disease is mainly environmental and is therefore potentially preventable.\r"

  ".W": "Senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) is typified pathologically by neuritic plaques (NP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the neocortex and hippocampus. However, in a large series of cases (60) over age 74 a significant minority (30%) lacked neocortical tangles. In order to determine if these latter cases (Group B) otherwise differ from the majority which have both neocortical plaques and tangles (Group A), various clinical and neuropathological parameters were measured for both groups and the results compared. The following indices were examined: degree of dementia, rate of progression of dementia, age at death, brain weight, cerebral hemispheric weight, cortical cell counts from the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the number of neocortical NP, the number of hippocampal NP and NFT, and the levels of neocortical choline acetyltransferase and somatostatin. The two groups showed no statistically significant differences in any of these categories except for increased numbers of neocortical NP in Group A in midfrontal and superior temporal regions. However, cases in Group A showed greater pathologic abnormality in nearly every parameter, albeit without attaining statistical significance. We conclude that SDAT with neocortical NFT is the same disease as SDAT without them, although the presence of such tangles is associated with a tendency towards greater severity.\r"

Myelination was assessed in 62 precisely defined central nervous system (CNS) sites of 162 infants with diverse diseases who were autopsied from 1972 to 1984 at Children's Hospital, Boston. The degree of myelination was graded on an ordinal scale of 0-4 using the inferior cerebellar peduncle as an internal standard. This grading system is a modification of that used for fetal myelination in the National Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP). The data are summarized by, median degree of myelination for each age group and site; and Ayer estimates for the age at which at least 10, 50, and 90% of infants reach a particular myelin degree in each site. \"Marker\" sites in the cerebrum are provided for the pathologist to compare myelination between an individual infant brain and the brains from our autopsy population. These data should be useful in identifying diverse peri- and postnatal conditions affecting myelination in human infancy. They also provide guidelines for the assessment of CNS myelination by sophisticated imaging techniques in living infants.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate how much skeletal muscle depends on influences coming from peripheral nerve, we studied muscle regeneration induced by bupivacaine in the permanently denervated soleus muscle of adult rats. Using light and electron microscopy, we studied the extent of maturation attained by regenerated myofibers and their ability to regenerate again after repeated bupivacaine injury. Morphometric analyses showed that within the first two weeks after injury, the regenerated denervated fibers increased in diameter, matured and then became atrophic. By electron microscopy the morphological characteristics of mature fibers are evident, but final differentiation into adult fiber types is not attained. This is in keeping with previously reported biochemical results. A new phase of massive regeneration occurred when bupivacaine treatment was repeated, thus demonstrating that regenerated myofibers devoid of innervation keep their intrinsic ability to regenerate after injury. Spontaneous though scanty regeneration also occurred in denervated regenerated muscle at late stages, when atrophy and dystrophy of fibers became prominent. Concomitantly the relative number of myosatellite cells remained high. These morphological observations further support the hypothesis that fiber regeneration participates in the maintenance of chronically denervated muscles.\r"

During paralysis, serum Mb and CK were normal. A rise in plasma potassium, resulting in clinical recovery, was associated with a simultaneous rise in serum Mb, and followed by a rise in serum CK. It is postulated that hypokalaemia might cause muscle ischaemia, which would result in an accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) within the muscle cells. High concentrations of FFA may induce molecular changes and increase the permeability of the sarcolemma. This might be the mechanism by which potassium is released from muscle cells into the circulation and muscle membrane excitability is restored.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained in blood samples from 40 untreated patients with lacunar infarcts and from 275 healthy control subjects without vascular risk factors. Pathological (\"solid body\") flow behaviour was detected in the blood of both groups of patients (SAE and lacunar infarcts). However, highly elevated plasma viscosity was a consistent feature only of SAE. The authors present the hypothesis that the high plasma viscosity in patients with SAE may account for the progressive degeneration of cerebral white matter. It is postulated that microcirculatory abnormalities due to microrheological changes may be one of the many missing links in the pathophysiology of SAE.\r"

Late SEP components (N75, P100 and N135) tended to be preserved in the patients of group 2 and 3.

At last follow-up, there were minimal differences between LH and TGH in overall mortality and functional outcome of the survivors. Alertness on admission was associated with a good outcome regardless of the type of hemorrhage, while a low Glasgow Coma Scale score, coma, ataxic respiration, abnormal pupil reactions, acute hypertension, large hemorrhage size and intraventricular blood were associated with a poor outcome.

Because of pubertal lability, the cause of a relapse might seem to be \"organic\", especially if the EEG also shows a \"deterioration\", yet psychogenic factors must not be disregarded. On the basis of typical case studies, a characteristic constellation is presented. The achievement of a \"well-behaved\" child at first dramatically improves and this correlates with the success of antiepileptic therapy. Then individuation and further development cannot adequately take place because the family unit is not functioning properly. At a critical stage of development, the excessive expectations of the parents lead to too much stress on the child, thus destroying the balance within the family system, which has hitherto been maintained only with difficulty. Attempts to improve the situation by changing the medication (increasing the dose or switching to another drug) fail. If, however, it is realized that the symptoms are of psychogenic origin, adequate therapeutic interventions (e.g. adequate schooling or professional training as well as psychotherapy) promise good results.\r"

Twelve of the 13 patients achieved a complete response (CR). Five of the 12 CRs subsequently relapsed at 3, 9, 9, 12, and 19 months. One patient died of leukemia 11 months following radiotherapy. The actuarial relapse-free survival at 1 year was 60%, and six patients (50%) remain disease-free with a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 10 to 115 months) following the completion of radiotherapy. Patients who failed to obtain a CR to their initial chemotherapy, whose chemotherapy CR was of short duration, or who relapsed initially in extranodal sites, tended to have a worse outcome with radiotherapy. Patients who had long disease-free intervals after initial chemotherapy or relapsed only in nodal sites tended to do relatively well. Radiation therapy was well tolerated with no major toxicity. Potentially curative radiation therapy should be considered an option in the management of selected patients who relapse following combination chemotherapy for advanced Hodgkin's disease.\r"

All patients had previously received nitrogen mustard, vincristine, prednisone, procarbazine (MOPP) or similar regimens and doxorubicin-containing combinations, and many had received extensive irradiation. Complete remission (CR) occurred in 23%, and was influenced by presence of extranodal disease, hemoglobin, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and number of prior relapses. Median survival for all patients was 50 weeks, and was affected adversely by the presence of extranodal disease and the number of prior relapses. Toxicity was significant, including infections (23%), neutropenic fever (34%), and hemorrhagic cystitis (23%), but was related in part to the extent of prior therapy. These results with this novel chemotherapy program in heavily pretreated patients suggest that MIME should be studied in less extensively treated patients and considered as a part of treatment programs for patients with Hodgkin's disease in first relapse.\r"

  ".W": "Cisplatin, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, is relatively inactive against metastatic melanoma. Prior trials have demonstrated partial response (PR) rates of less than 10% with cisplatin alone. WR-2721 is an organic thiophosphate compound, which in the animal model, selectively protects normal tissues against the toxicity of cisplatin chemotherapy. During the course of a phase I trial of WR-2721 and cisplatin, objective PRs were noted in patients with far advanced metastatic melanoma. These observations led us to perform a phase II trial of WR-2721 and cisplatin. Thirty-six patients received 128 courses of WR-2721 before cisplatin (60 to 150 mg/m2). All patients had progressive disease before treatment. Objective PRs were observed in 19 of 36 evaluable patients (53%). Three additional patients had minor responses (MRs). PRs occurred in 53% of patients with prior chemotherapy (ten of 19). Sites of responding metastases were subcutaneous disease (15 of 19 patients), lymph nodes (16 of 21 patients), lung (four of ten patients), and liver (eight of 17 patients). The median duration of response was 4 months, with a mean of 4.5 months (range, 1 to 8 months). Transient nephrotoxicity was observed in less than 5% of courses. In all cases, renal function returned to normal within 1 to 2 weeks. Hematologic toxicity was mild and infrequent. Nine patients developed peripheral neuropathy following a median cisplatin dose of 670 mg/m2. Twenty patients experienced mild clinical hearing loss. These data suggest that WR-2721 may potentiate the antitumor activity of cisplatin in metastatic melanoma.\r"

The study was based on the premise that the effect of misonidazole would be maximized when a high dose of the drug was administered and, thus, high hypoxic cell sensitization could be obtained when using a high single dose of radiation where the hypoxic fraction would be expected to dominate in the survivors. In a nonrandomized study of 41 patients treated with misonidazole and 22 without, the 1-year local control was 67% and 55%, and 1-year survival was 50% and 77%, respectively. Although there was a bias towards larger tumors in the patients treated with the sensitizer, we were unable to demonstrate an advantage to misonidazole in this clinical situation.\r"

  ".W": "The management of extremity soft tissue sarcoma is undergoing rapid change as new techniques of adjuvant treatment are developed. Critical assessment of these advances requires a fundamental understanding of the natural course of this disease. In an effort to define important prognostic factors, this review of 423 adults with localized extremity soft tissue sarcomas, treated at one institution (1968 to 1978), was undertaken. The effect of the following variables on survival was examined: patient factors, ie, age, sex, symptoms, and status at presentation; tumor factors, ie, site, size, depth, bone or neurovascular invasion, histogenesis, grade, and nodal status; and treatment factors, ie, biopsy technique, type of operation, surgical margins, adjuvant treatment, and subsequent local treatment failure. Patient factors with an adverse impact on survival included age greater than 53 and the presence of local symptoms. High tumor grade, positive regional nodes, histology other than liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma or malignant fibrohistiocytoma, invasion of vital structures, proximal site, deep location, and size greater than 10 cm were also poor prognosticators. Treatment factors correlating with optimal survival included limb sparing surgery, adequate margins, biopsy with delayed definitive resection, and absence of subsequent local failure. Patients treated by amputation had a greater proportion of risk factors than patients treated with limb-sparing surgery (LSS). When the data were subjected to multivariate analysis, the following variables emerged as independent predictors of poor outcome: local symptoms, age greater than 53, high grade, proximal site, size greater than 10 cm, positive regional nodes, surgery by amputation, and inadequate margins. These factors are now to be evaluated in our prospective study based on 600 patients with soft tissue sarcoma of all sites admitted to our institution in the last 3 years. These factors should be considered as important stratifications in prospective trials.\r"

In order to improve outcome, patients with locoregional disease were treated using a combined modality approach. Patients were treated with chemotherapy consisting of a 96-hour continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 1,000 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 4 and days 29 to 32; cisplatin 75 mg/m2, day 1 and 29; and radiation 3,000 rad, days 1 to 19. In the absence of progressive disease, patients underwent esophagectomy. One hundred twenty-eight patients were registered of whom 113 were eligible and 106 were evaluable. Toxicity included gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, mucositis, and myelosuppression. One hundred two patients completed chemoradiotherapy. Following its completion, 11 patients refused surgery, six were considered poor surgical risks, and 14 had progressive disease. Of the remaining 71 patients, 16 had unresectable disease, 13 had residual disease which was incompletely resected, 24 had disease which could be completely resected, and 18 were without disease on pathologic examination. The overall operability rate was 63% and the overall resectability rate, 49%. Surgical mortality was 11%. Eighty-nine of 113 eligible patients have died, with a median survival of 12 months and a 2-year survival of 28%. The median postsurgical survival for all 71 patients was 14 months and was 32 months for those patients attaining complete remission (CR). Combined modality therapy remains an investigational approach. Attempts should be directed at increasing response rate to initial therapy. A randomized comparison between combined modality treatment and radiation therapy is necessary to definitively determine the usefulness of this more aggressive approach.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients (16 male, seven female) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were treated by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of mitoxantrone every 4 weeks. At each treatment, a catheter was inserted percutaneously into the main hepatic artery via the femoral artery under image intensification. Treatment consisted of a 24-hour continuous HAI of mitoxantrone, 6 mg/m2/d X 3 (eight patients) or 10 mg/m2/d X 3 (14 patients) without heparin. Eight patients had only one infusion, nine patients four infusions, five patients three infusions, two patients two infusions, and one patient five infusions. A partial response was seen in six patients, with a median duration of 20 weeks (range, 18 to 38 weeks). Five patients achieved stable disease, with a median duration of 20 weeks (range, 11 to 42 weeks). The median survival of the overall group was 22 weeks. Survivals of responding, stable, and nonresponding patients were 32 weeks, 24 weeks, and 9 weeks, respectively. Complications of catheter placement included asymptomatic dissection of the hepatic artery (one patient), and asymptomatic thrombosis of the hepatic artery (five patients). Three patients experienced mild nausea and vomiting, and six patients had mild to moderate alopecia. Granulocytopenia was frequent at both dose schedules. The granulocyte nadir was greater than 1,000/microL in 34% of evaluable courses, 500 to 1,000/microL in 32%, and less than 500/microL in 34% of courses. Two patients developed neutropenia-associated fever. A platelet nadir below 100,000/microL was seen after only 10% of courses, and only two patients had platelets below 50,000/microL. Seven patients received doxorubicin after progression on mitoxantrone. Four received systemic doxorubicin, 50 mg/m2, and three HAI of doxorubicin, 25 mg/m2, for three days. Two patients achieved partial response (18 weeks and 32 weeks) to HAI doxorubicin. Mitoxantrone has activity in HCC and is well tolerated when administered by HAI. It is not entirely cross-resistant with doxorubicin.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients with refractory ovarian cancer were treated on a pilot protocol of verapamil plus Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH). This trial was based on our previous laboratory studies which demonstrated that Adriamycin resistance in human ovarian cancer cell lines could be partially reversed by exposure of the cells to high concentrations of verapamil (3,000 ng/mL). Patients were treated in an intensive care unit with continuous cardiovascular monitoring. The dose of verapamil was escalated in each patient until hypotension or heart block developed, and this dose was maintained for 72 hours. Adriamycin (50 mg/m2) was infused over 24 hours during the second day of the verapamil infusion and verapamil alone was administered on the third day in an effort to block efflux from drug-resistant cells. This intensive approach led to a median plasma verapamil level of 1,273 ng/mL (range, 720 to 2,767). However, the high infusion rates of verapamil (9 micrograms/kg/min) required to achieve these plasma levels produced an unacceptable degree of cardiac toxicity. Two patients developed transient atropine-responsive complete heart block and four patients developed transient congestive heart failure with increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. There was no evidence that the noncardiac toxicities of Adriamycin were enhanced by verapamil. There were no objective responses to therapy. Future studies should use less cardiotoxic calcium channel blockers that can be safely administered to produce the plasma levels required for in vitro sensitization of drug resistant cells.\r"

On that basis, a progressively more conservative approach to the treatment of this condition was adopted, especially in young children. Experience with this mode of management over the period 1972 to 1984 is presented. Of 111 patients under 16 years of age with depressed skull fractures, 64 had simple and 47 compound fractures. Simple depressed skull fractures occurred in a younger age group after less significant trauma than compound fractures. In those patients who were treated surgically, there was an 11% incidence of dural laceration in patients with simple depressed fractures versus 67% for the patients with compound depressed fractures. There was no difference in outcome between surgically and nonsurgically treated patients with simple depressed fractures with respect to the occurrence of seizures, neurological dysfunction, or cosmetic appearance. Surgical treatment prolonged hospitalization, and the only case with a fatal outcome was found in the group of patients treated surgically. It is suggested that the standard treatment of simple depressed skull fractures in the pediatric age group should not include surgery. Surgery is indicated when there is definite evidence of dural penetration and in the older child with an unacceptable cosmetic appearance.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report seven individuals from two families, all of whom had aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. These cases and all reported cases of familial aneurysms (243 aneurysms in 177 patients from 74 families) were submitted to computer-aided multivariate analysis to determine if the aneurysms or the patients who harbor them differ from sporadic aneurysm cases. Familial aneurysms rupture at a smaller size (mean diameter 10.5 mm), and when the patient is younger (mean age 42.3 years and decennial age at peak incidence 40 to 49 years). There is a similar sex distribution (male to female ratio 48:52), a similar incidence of multiple aneurysms (21.5%), and a similar predominance of females over males with multiple aneurysms (2.2:1). Anterior communicating artery aneurysms occur less often in familial cases (19%) than in sporadic cases. In sibling pairs the aneurysms occur at the same or at mirror sites, and rupture within the same decade twice as frequently as randomly selected nonfamilial aneurysm patient pairs. The occurrence of aneurysms at identical and mirror sites is more frequent in familial cases and appears to be a function of the degree of kinship between affected individuals. These observations suggest a genetic basis for the pathogenesis of familial intracranial aneurysms.\r"

  ".W": "A 48-year-old man was admitted with the sudden onset of symptoms of stroke caused by hemorrhage in an oligodendroglioma. Despite surgery and antiedema treatment, the patient died. Histological evaluation revealed an oligodendroglioma with calcified capillaries of the retiform type. To further investigate this phenomenon, a total of 160 gliomas were reviewed: 90 glioblastomas multiforme, 30 oligodendrogliomas, and 40 astrocytomas. Sufficient data were available for clinical evaluation in 100 cases. Of these, 5% (two oligodendrogliomas and three glioblastomas multiforme) were related to clinically significant hemorrhages. Of the remaining cases, microhemorrhages were found in 53.0% of the glioblastomas, in 56.7% of the oligodendrogliomas, and in 10.0% of the astrocytomas. In each case reviewed, the capillaries were assigned to one of three groups: axial, retiform, or glomeruloid. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between hemorrhages and retiform capillaries in all three types of tumors, except that in oligodendrogliomas the statistical significance held true when calcification of the capillaries was also present. Glomeruloid-type capillaries were only weakly associated with hemorrhages, and no association was found for axial capillaries. A large-scale prospective study is necessary to more precisely assess the role of each of the three types of capillaries in hemorrhages of gliomas. Based on data available so far, patients with glial tumors with retiform capillaries, confirmed on biopsy, should be carefully monitored to exclude possible intratumoral hemorrhage.\r"

The injuries were separated into five grades of severity based on neurological examination, including cranial CT. The injuries were also grouped into three categories based on facial regional involvement, using chi-square contingency table analysis. The data demonstrated that patients with upper facial fractures were at greatest risk for serious CHI. Injuries to both the mandibular and the midfacial regions with no upper facial involvement more frequently resulted in mild CHI with a modest likelihood of no neurological deficits. Trauma to only the mandibular region or to only the midfacial region was least likely to involve CHI.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report the results of a study to evaluate the effect of stimulation of the medullary reticular formation on cerebral vasomotor tonus and intracranial pressure (ICP) after the hypothalamic dorsomedial nucleus and midbrain reticular formation were destroyed. Systemic arterial pressure (BP), ICP, and local cerebral blood volume (CBV) were continuously recorded in 32 cats. To assess the changes in the cerebral vasomotor tonus, the vasomotor index defined by the increase in ICP per unit change in BP was calculated. In 29 of the 32 animals, BP, ICP, and CBV increased simultaneously immediately after stimulation. The increase in ICP was not secondary to the increase in BP, because the vasomotor index during stimulation was significantly higher than the vasomotor index after administration of angiotensin II. The vasomotor index was high during stimulation of the area around the nucleus reticularis parvocellularis. In animals with the spinal cord transected at the C-2 vertebral level, ICP increased without a change in BP. These findings indicate that the areas stimulated in the medullary reticular formation play an important role in decreasing cerebral vasomotor tonus. This effect was not influenced by bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy, indicating that there is an intrinsic neural pathway that regulates cerebral vasomotor tonus directly. In three animals, marked biphasic or progressive increases in ICP up to 100 mm Hg were evoked by stimulation. The reduction of cerebral vasomotor tonus and concomitant vasopressor response induced by stimulation of the medullary reticular formation may be one of the causes of acute brain swelling.\r"

This study was performed to ascertain the time course of these changes and also to examine the type of brain damage that may occur under such circumstances. Halothane anesthesia was induced in rats, and 25 microliter autologous blood was injected into the caudate nucleus; the effects were studied with autoradiographic measurement of local cerebral blood flow and capillary permeability, and also by light microscopy and histochemical techniques. Blood flow returned to normal or to slightly increased levels within the first 3 hours, and ischemic levels of flow were found to persist only to a marginal degree beyond 10 minutes after the lesions were made. Capillary permeability was maximum during the first 30 minutes after the hemorrhage and diminished with time. Structural evidence of ischemic damage was localized to the cortex overlying the hemorrhage, but was not seen in the caudate nucleus. Nevertheless, histochemical investigation did reveal an area of disturbed enzyme function in the striatum. This finding of biochemical disturbance without structural evidence of ischemic damage reveals that there is an area around the hematoma that, although demonstrating disturbed function, does not show structural damage, and the milieu of this partially injured brain may be implicated in the delayed development of the ischemic brain damage that follows intracerebral hemorrhage in man.\r"

The fistula was occluded after an 8-week interval with the rats under both normotension and metaraminol-induced hypertension, and evidence of blood-brain barrier disruption was investigated with an Evans blue dye technique. The results indicate that an intracranial AV fistula may cause cerebral steal which is responsible for a reduction in the threshold for hypertensive breakthrough following fistula occlusion.\r"

Immediately following balloon inflation in the caudate nucleus of rats, there was a significant increase in intracranial pressure to 14 +/- 1 mm Hg (mean +/- standard error of the mean), accompanied by a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ipsilateral frontal cortex, as measured by the hydrogen-clearance technique. Carbon-14-iodoantipyrine autoradiography revealed a significant reduction in the CBF of the ipsilateral caudate nucleus 4 hours after balloon inflation: 31% of the caudate nucleus had a CBF of less than 20 ml X 100 gm-1 X min-1 compared to only 1% in the sham-treated control group (balloon insertion without inflation). The rats with an intracerebral mass exhibited a significant increase in the volume of ischemic damage in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus (17.1% of total volume) compared to only 1.7% in the sham-treated group; however, there was no evidence of cerebral edema. Ischemic damage and reduced CBF persisted for 4 hours after transient inflation of a microballoon in the caudate nucleus. This suggests that ischemic damage occurs at the time of formation of the lesion and is not prevented by its early removal.\r"

  ".W": "The effectiveness of transependymal absorption of cerebrospinal fluid in hydrocephalus was studied by correlating the measured water content of feline hydrocephalic white matter with the rate of enlargement of the ventricles. Two groups of cats were subjected to opening of either the calvaria or the calvaria and dura before the intracisternal injection of kaolin to obtain two profiles of ventricular enlargement. The water content 1, 2, and 3 mm from the lateral ventricles was measured in each group using the dry/wet weight and microgravimetric techniques after sacrificing the animals in each group at 2, 3, or 6 weeks after inducing hydrocephalus. In the animals with both calvarial and dural opening, the ventricles enlarged rapidly in the first 2 to 3 weeks and then continued to increase but at a slower rate. Concomitant with this early increase of ventricular size was a progressive increase in white matter water content both adjacent to and remote from the ventricles, which continued through 6 weeks. When only the calvaria was opened, ventricular size increased gradually, but continued to increase at a constant rate throughout the 6 weeks. Water content adjacent to the ventricle did not increase until the 3rd week, with little spread to adjacent areas by the 6th week. The central canals of the spinal cord were enlarged in both groups at all sampling levels. Neither increased periventricular water nor dilatation of the central canal was associated with stabilization of ventricular size in these studies. The authors conclude that these pathways are not sufficient to arrest the hydrocephalic process in these models.\r"

Two treatment groups were established, one receiving the antiprogesterone agent RU-38486 (10 mg/kg/day in suspension) and the other receiving only vehicle. After 3 months, the tumor growth index (defined as the tumor volume at 3 months divided by the initial tumor volume) was 0.25 +/- 0.46 (mean +/- standard deviation) in the group receiving antiprogesterone and was 1.54 +/- 0.58 in the control group (p = 0.041). Further investigation of the effect of antiprogestational agents on the growth and hormone-binding proteins of other meningiomas will better define the mechanism of their effects.\r"

The ploidy index and percentage of cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were calculated for each specimen. The results were compared with the age and sex of the patients; the site, the histological subtype, and mitotic rate of the neoplasms; and the estrogen- and progesterone-receptor levels assayed in cytosol-enriched supernatants from cryostat-cut sections. Sixteen neoplasms (41%) were aneuploid. These included two recurrent neoplasms, seven of the eight neoplasms from patients with multiple meningiomas, and three clinically aggressive neoplasms (one hemangiopericytic and two anaplastic meningiomas). Significant correlations were found between values for the ploidy index (r = 0.75, p less than 0.01), the percentage of S-phase cells (r = 0.82, p less than 0.01), and the percentage of G2/M-phase cells (r = 0.69, p less than 0.05) in vivo and in vitro. The results support the suggestion that flow cytometry for DNA in meningiomas may be of value in predicting the behavior of these neoplasms, and indicate that under controlled conditions explant cell cultures may provide a useful model for the proliferative characteristics of meningiomas in vivo.\r"

The weight, protein, DNA, trypsin and chymotrypsin concentrations of the pancreas at each period were measured. Over the entire experimental period, body weight did not differ among groups. Pancreatic weight, protein and trypsin activity were highest in the EW group, followed by the SPI group, and lowest in the C group. Chymotrypsin activity was significantly higher in the EW and SPI groups than the C group. DNA content did not differ significantly among groups over the entire experimental period, although it was elevated in the SPI or EW groups compared to the C groups at some of the time periods. Only one microscopic nodule was observed in all of the animals; it was found at 3 mo in the pancreas from an animal fed EW.

  ".W": "Intestinal structure of male adult African Green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops ssp vervets) was studied after 3 1/2 yr of consuming diets containing 10% psyllium husk or cellulose. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) identified mild damage (cellular swelling and disarray, and microvillar denudation and disarray) at villous tips throughout the small intestine in the psyllium-fed monkeys. The cellulose group had similar duodenal damage. Differences were not found in colons by SEM. By light microscopy, jejunum had shorter villi with psyllium feeding, based upon villous height (P less than 0.05), and length around a sectioned villus (P less than 0.1), but not based upon the number of enterocytes per villus. Jejunal and ileal circular and longitudinal muscle layer thicknesses were increased in psyllium-fed monkeys. Colonic mucosal height was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced and muscle layer thickness was mildly reduced in the psyllium-fed monkeys. Group differences were not found in intestinal weight or length or in the weight of small intestinal mucosal scrapings. Psyllium husk may cause epithelial cell loss and muscle layer hypertrophy in the jejunum and ileum and thinning of the colonic wall after prolonged feeding.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolizable energy (ME) of two high fiber diets, providing between 33 and 74 g dietary fiber (DF) per day, was calculated by application of Atwater's general factors (4, 9 and 4 kcal/g protein, fat and carbohydrate, respectively), Merrill and Watt's specific factors, and the British approach in which ME from carbohydrates is calculated by multiplication of the monosaccharide equivalent by 3.75 kcal/g. These factors were applied to the intakes of fat, protein and carbohydrate of 20 human subjects in two balance experiments. ME estimated by Merrill and Watt's factors agreed better with ME estimated in the balance experiment than did ME calculated by Atwater's factors or by the British approach. It was calculated that the DF in diet A, derived mainly from cereals, contributed 2.5 +/- 1.4 kcal/g to ME of the diet. The corresponding figure for DF in diet B, derived mainly from beans, vegetables and fruits, was 3.1 +/- 1.2 kcal/g. It was concluded that Merrill & Watt's factors represent the best system in current use for calculation of ME in DF-rich diets.\r"

Although results with these solutions were disappointing, the data suggested that very large oligosaccharides were potential sources of intravenous carbohydrate. To test this hypothesis, four young pigs (3.6 +/- 0.2 kg; mean +/- SD) were infused with sterile solutions for a 6-d period. On days 1 and 6, a balanced isotonic electrolyte solution was infused. On days 2-5 a 9% solution of glycogen was infused at a rate providing 17.7 +/- 0.77 g/d. For each study day the remaining portion of the energy, protein, essential fatty acids and micronutrients was supplied enterally. No adverse reactions were noted during glycogen infusion, and the animals continued to grow. Glycogen utilization was 66.4 +/- 4.3%. Of the total carbohydrate excreted, 85.4% was composed of oligosaccharides of maltotetraose size or larger. Free glucose accounted for 3.5% of the total excreted, while maltose plus maltotriose accounted for 11.1%. Plasma concentrations of oligosaccharide-bound glucose increased during glycogen infusion, rising from a base-line value of 11.0 +/- 14 mg/dL to an overall mean value for the 4-d period of 100.3 +/- 31.6 mg/dL.\r"

The best growth response was achieved with dextrin and the next best with corn starch. Fish grew at the same rate when glucose, maltose or sucrose was the only dietary carbohydrate source. Dietary fructose resulted in the lowest growth rate. Feed efficiency and percent retained energy values followed the same pattern as growth rates. These data suggest that the catfish is apparently unable to utilize dietary mono- and disaccharides as energy sources. Oral carbohydrate tolerance tests using glucose, maltose, fructose, sucrose and dextrin were conducted with larger channel catfish. Oral glucose and maltose resulted in a persistent hyperglycemia indicative of a diabetic-like status. Fructose appeared to be poorly absorbed from the intestinal tract and did not appear to be converted to glucose. Oral administration of sucrose was followed by a gradual increase in plasma glucose, with no detectable fructose being absorbed until the 6-h period. Oral dextrin resulted in less than a two-fold increase in plasma glucose, which remained constant from 2 to 4 h after administration and then declined. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that certain fishes, including the channel catfish, resemble diabetic animals by having insufficient insulin for maximum carbohydrate utilization.\r"

FMO hepatic activity in ascorbic acid-supplemented guinea pigs on a food-restricted regimen was 176% of that found in animals fed the adequate diet ad libitum. This increase in activity was not related to stress.

Six levels of dietary ascorbic acid (0, 0.076, 0.5, 1, 5 and 8%) were used. Plasma ascorbic acid rose as dietary ascorbic acid intake increased from 1 to 8%. Mice fed a diet with 5 or 8% added ascorbic acid had significantly higher levels of ascorbic acid in the heart, kidney, lung, muscle and spleen than did control mice fed an ascorbic acid-free diet. Mice fed a diet with 1% added ascorbic acid had elevated ascorbic acid levels in the heart, kidney, lung and spleen. No significant change was observed in ascorbic acid level in the brain, adrenal gland or leukocytes in any of the experimental groups. Ascorbic acid level in the eyes was only slightly higher in mice fed a diet containing 8% added ascorbic acid than in control mice. The observation that the kidney had the greatest increase in ascorbic acid content suggests that the kidney may be a very important organ not only in elimination but also in catabolism of this vitamin. A diet containing 0.5 or 0.076% added ascorbic acid did not significantly increase ascorbic acid content in any of the organs studied. Mice fed a diet with 0.076% added ascorbic acid had slightly, but statistically significantly, lower levels of ascorbic acid in the liver, lung, muscle and spleen that control mice. Mice fed a diet with 0.5% added ascorbic acid had a lower ascorbic acid content in the liver and muscle than the controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sedentary and exercised rats were pair fed diets marginal in riboflavin (2.0 or 2.5 mg/kg), and their tissue riboflavin concentrations and erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficients (EGRAC) were compared. The rats exercised for 8 wk had similar body weights but significantly greater weights for heart, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, less epididymal fat and more total muscle nitrogen and riboflavin than their sedentary controls. Similar changes were evident after 6 wk of exercise, but some were not statistically significant. The EGRAC values of both exercised and sedentary rats responded to changes in dietary riboflavin but were not different from each other. The specific activity of mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (per milligram protein) of the soleus muscle was unaffected by exercise; however, when expressed per gram of tissue or per muscle, the activities in exercised rats were 25% (P less than 0.05) and 60% (P less than 0.01) higher, respectively, than in sedentary rats. On the basis of the riboflavin-dependent parameters measured in this study, exercise did not increase the dietary riboflavin requirement of growing rats but did increase total riboflavin retention in gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.\r"

Pancreatic and hepatic Mn content were 50 and 39% of respective controls in Mn-deficient rats at wk 4. Pancreatic amylase activity was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher at wk 8 and 10 in Mn-deficient rats than in controls. Mn deficiency did not alter pancreatic lipase, chymotrypsin or trypsin activities. Dietary Mn repletion restored pancreatic Mn content but did not reverse the elevated pancreatic amylase.

  ".W": "Treatment of newborn pigs with supplemental iron is a common procedure utilized to prevent neonatal anemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the hepatic distribution and intracellular metabolism of iron-dextran, a widely used colloidal-iron-carbohydrate preparation. Piglets were injected intramuscularly with iron-dextran (50 mg Fe/kg body wt) at 1 d of age. Hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells (Kupffer cells and endothelial cells) were isolated from iron-treated and control (uninjected) piglets at 2, 6 and 11 d of age. The concentrations of iron, copper and zinc in isolated cells were determined by atomic-absorption spectroscopy. In addition, the quantities of ferritin-protein and ferritin-iron were measured by immunoelectrophoresis and ion-exchange chromatography, respectively. At 2 d of age, the concentration (microgram/mg cell protein) of iron was 5-, 62- and 54-fold higher in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and endothelial cells, respectively, isolated from iron-treated piglets than from control piglets. Hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and endothelial cells accumulated ferritin in response to iron-dextran treatment. Higher concentrations of ferritin-protein and ferritin-iron were present in Kupffer cells and endothelial cells than in hepatocytes at all times after treatment with iron-dextran. The percentage of cellular iron that was associated with ferritin, however, was greater in hepatocytes than in sinusoidal cells. Iron accumulated by all three liver cell types was mobilized to extrahepatic sites. Slight alterations in zinc and copper status of liver cells were evident at 11 d of age as a result of iron treatment.\r"

Three types of soy protein, a soy flour, a soy concentrate and a soy isolate, were used in two types of meals: one consisting of rice and meat sauce and the other of white or whole-meal bread. Thirty and 100% of the protein of the meat sauce and 50% of the protein of bread was replaced with the soy protein products. Replacement of 30% of the protein in meat sauce had a marginal effect on the percentage absorption of zinc, whereas the absolute amount of zinc absorbed was lower due to the lower zinc content in soy products than in meat. After total replacement of the meat protein, a significantly lower percentage and absolute absorption of zinc was observed. A lower absorption of zinc was observed when soy protein was added to white bread. The absorption of zinc from the whole-meal bread was low and did not change when 50% of the flour protein was replaced by soy protein. We conclude that the effect of soy protein on zinc absorption depends on the degree of replacement, the phytic acid and zinc content of the soy product and the protein content of the meal.\r"

In addition, cecal contents were analyzed for ammonia (NH3), urea (U) and free amino acids (AA) to study the reduction in maintenance N requirements due to the action of antibiotics. Results of the N-balance trials verified the reduction in maintenance N requirements with antibiotics as described in the literature. The reduction, however, was not as large as previously demonstrated, possibly because of severe diarrhea and greater liquid accumulation in the cecum of rats fed antibiotics. The concentration of free AA and U in the postabsorptive region of the intestine (cecum) of rats consuming antibiotics was greater than when antibiotics were not consumed. Cecal N concentrations supported the concept that the mode of action of antibiotics in reducing maintenance N requirements was via reduced destruction of AA of body origin in the lower intestine. Cecal levels of NH3 were similar in both antibiotic and nonantibiotic groups. The amount of N needed for body maintenance when conditions favored minimum destruction of body AA by lower intestine microorganisms was small, less than 1% dietary CP. Maintenance N may be limited to the needs for tissues on the exterior of the body, such as hair, which are poorly recycled through the digestive tract.\r"

We compared livers from 12- and 24-mo-old mice fed control (C, approximately 95 kcal/wk) or restricted (R, approximately 55 kcal/wk) amounts of diet since 3 wk of age. We hypothesized that dietary restriction might alter the activity levels of enzymes with possible relevance to aging processes. The enzymes included several xenobiotic metabolizers, radical scavengers (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), superoxide sources (xanthine oxidase, peroxisomal beta-oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA) and glucose-6-phosphatase. Lipid peroxidation (LP) was also measured. Comparing 12- and 24-mo-old mice, the strongest diet or age effect was an increased catalase activity for group R (42% higher at 12 mo, 64% at 24 mo). LP was clearly lower in group R at 12 mo (a 30% decrease) and somewhat lower (13%) at 24 mo than in group C. Similarly, in 12-mo-old C and R mice injected with either the P-450 inducer beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF in corn oil) or with corn oil alone. R mice showed higher catalase activity (40-44%) and lower LP (43-46%) in both beta-NF-injected and vehicle-injected groups. These data suggest that if free radical damage is involved in aging, it may be a particular kind of damage, that is, that in part prevented by a selective increase in catalase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Rats fed low protein diets often exhibit an elevation in adaptive thermogenesis that may result in part from activation of thyroid hormone action at the level of peripheral deiodination of thyroxine (T4) to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3). This possibility was examined by comparing the kinetic parameters of iodothyronine 5'-deiodination in hepatic and renal microsomes and the efficiency of energy retention in weanling rats fed diets containing 5% (LP-5), 8% (LP-8) or 22% (NP) casein. Energy balance measurements revealed that efficiency of energy retention was reduced in rats fed LP-5, whereas no significant change in adaptive thermogenesis was observed in rats fed LP-8. In the LP-5 group the maximal activity of hepatic 5'-deiodinase per milligram of microsomal protein was not different from that of the NP group; however, the Vmax of the renal enzyme was 21% higher. In both tissues, the Km of the reaction was not affected by dietary treatment. Hepatic and renal 5'-deiodination in rats fed LP-8 was similar to that in rats fed LP-5. When compared to corresponding NP controls, each of the low protein dietary groups (LP-5, LP-8) had a higher serum total T3 concentration, whereas serum free T3 and total T4 concentrations were unaffected by the dietary treatments. The findings demonstrate that iodothyronine 5'-deiodination and circulating thyroid hormone concentrations vary in a similar manner in LP-5 and LP-8 animals even though these two groups exhibit different responses in energy efficiency relative to NP controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The following biological systems were improved by food restriction, with values for older mice being similar to those previously found for younger individuals: tight wire clinging, a measure of neuromuscular performance; open field movement, a measure of voluntary activity; tail tendon denaturation rate, a measure of collagen solubility; urine concentrating ability, a measure of renal function, and hair regrowth rate, a measure of the frequency of hair follicle cycling. However, wound healing was slower in food-restricted mice than in ad libitum-fed controls. The same food restriction treatment had entirely different effects on longevities of a different genotype, male B6 (C57BL/6J) mice, reducing mean and maximum life spans 265 and 27 d, respectively. This surprising deleterious effect was not predicted by tests of tight wire clinging, open field movement and tail tendon denaturation, but was predicted by hair regrowth rates, as these were lower in restricted B6 mice than in fed controls. In genetically obese (ob/ob) B6 mice, food restriction extended mean and maximum longevities 327 and 440 d, yet no biological systems tested performed better than those of food-restricted normal (+/+) mice whose life spans were reduced. Thus the food restriction regimen that increased longevities for individuals of two genotypes decreased them for individuals of a third genotype tested in the same set of experiments.\r"

  ".U": "87168770\r", 
  ".W": "Administration of a thermogenic mixture of ephedrine, caffeine and theophylline to grossly obese (11-12 mo old) fa/fa Zucker rats led to a rapid decline in their body weight, which reached lean levels within 9-10 wk, and this postobese weight was maintained for another 5-6 wk. Compared to the no-drug obese controls (O-ND), food intake was reduced by 70% during the dynamic phase of weight loss and by 50% during the postobese period in the food-restricted animals (O-FR) and by about 40% during both phases in the ephedrine/methylxanthines (O-E/Mx) animals. Energy expenditure in the O-FR group was lower than in the O-E/Mx group by 25-33%. Analysis of body composition showed that body fat in both O-FR and O-E/Mx groups was much lower than in the O-ND group, by 2.5- and 4-fold, respectively, and body protein was lower by 50 and 28%, respectively. Thus, compared to the O-ND group, the fat:protein ratio was only 25% lower in the O-FR animals but was three times less in the O-E/Mx group. These findings demonstrate that in the fa/fa rat a mixture of ephedrine and methylxanthines reduces food intake but also minimizes the fall in metabolic rate that usually accompanies such an energy deficit, effects that led to a reversal of their gross obesity. The ability of ephedrine alone or in combination with methylxanthines to reverse obesity in animal models with dietary and hypothalamic etiologies is thus extended to the obesity resulting from the inheritance of a single-gene recessive defect.\r"

  ".W": "An 8-wk trial was conducted to compare the effects of exercise and intermittent fasting, either singly or combined, on growth responses of rats. Four-week-old male Wistar rats, 85-110 g each, were assigned to one of four groups (n = 9): control, exercise on a motor-driven treadmill, fasting every other day (EOD) and fasting EOD and exercise combined. At the end of the trial, the exercised rats had consumed 7% less feed, had gained 7% less weight and had 36% less carcass fat than the control rats. Fasting on alternate days markedly reduced the growth rate of the young rats. Fasted-EOD rats weighed less than half as much as the control rats, had 64% less carcass fat and 51% less lean mass and had smaller livers, kidneys, hearts, tibias and tibialis anterior muscles. The addition of exercise to the fasting EOD regimen improved the growth of the animals. When the fasted-EOD rats were also exercised, they gained 29% more weight, consumed 11% more feed and had carcasses that contained 29% more lean mass and 18% less fat than the fasted-EOD rats. The data suggest that exercise may be beneficial where feed restriction is episodic, allowing some capacity for catch-up growth.\r"

In a prospective study, the authors monitored the outpatient prescribing patterns of internal medicine residents and evaluated the effect of placing a one-page set of antibiotic guidelines in each patient examining room. Appropriateness of antibiotic choices was scored periodically. A 12-month pre-intervention survey of antibiotic use showed that 50% of the choices were inappropriate. Comparison of a four-month post-intervention analysis with the same four-month interval in the pre-intervention period showed no significant difference between the percentages of inappropriate prescriptions. The most common reasons for inappropriate use were: 1) failure to document a clinically significant bronchial infection, and 2) inadequate evaluation of nonspecific urinary tract complaints. The authors conclude that the ready availability of information about appropriate antibiotic use is not effective in changing antibiotic choices, and that educational strategies regarding antibiotic use must also address diagnostic evaluation.\r"

Stable funding for these fields is important to society and critical to the healthy development of academic general internal medicine. Strategies to augment funding can include political interventions to increase support for the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment and to secure designated funds within the National Institutes of Health. Public funding is also needed for career development awards in these fields. Research support also could be enhanced by establishing a consortium of foundations interested in funding investigator-initiated grants through open competition, by developing a mechanism for reviewing proposals from small foundations, by developing consortia in the private sector to support focused research, and by developing endowments to support research.\r"

Eighty-two students were given a pre-test consisting of written protocols summarizing the histories of 25 patients who had undergone coronary arteriography. The students estimated the likelihood of coronary artery disease for each case and were then randomized to receive one of two short written clinical lessons: a cardiology textbook chapter on interpreting chest pain, or a lesson based on a prediction rule for estimating probability of coronary artery disease. All students were given a post-test similar to the pre-test. Students who were given the textbook lesson showed no change in the accuracy of their probability estimates. Students who were taught the prediction rule significantly improved their probability estimates, as measured by a statistical index of calibration. The authors conclude that traditional teaching methods do not provide students with guidance in estimating disease probability, and that better teaching methods are needed. In this study, a clinical prediction rule fulfilled the need for instruction in probability estimation.\r"

In-hospital complications included confusion (49%), urinary tract infection (33%), and heart rhythm disturbance (26%). Mean length of stay was 21.7 days and mean hospital charges were $11,052. The outliers (15%) averaged 60.6 days in length of stay and $28,190 in charges. Stepwise multivariate regression revealed that lengths of stay varied significantly with prefracture functional status, presence of intertrochanteric fractures, and in-hospital complications, but not with patient age. Examination of these findings in relation to prospective reimbursement led to the conclusion that hip fracture patients are particularly vulnerable in the era of new hospital strategies to avoid high-cost patients and curtail hospital costs.\r"

The kinds of arrhythmia that can be considered for possible surgical intervention share several features. Each produces symptoms and usually is hemodynamically compromising. Each requires extensive preoperative and intraoperative electrophysiologic evaluation to establish the mechanism, response to drugs, and suitability for surgery. Although reports of surgical arrhythmia treatment have been limited in children, with increasing success the indications for such treatment may become less stringent. Our recommendations are shown in the Table. In general, patients intolerant of or unresponsive to medical treatment for symptomatic arrhythmia (tachycardia or bradycardia), should be considered candidates for surgical antiarrhythmia procedures. These patients should be referred for testing to cardiac centers staffed by pediatric cardiac electrophysiologists and surgeons experienced in arrhythmia diagnosis and ablation. Careful evaluation can identify those patients in whom surgical approaches are most appropriate. At present, surgical operations for selected, serious pediatric cardiac arrhythmias offer definitive and possibly curative treatment, and may be preferable to inadequate, poorly tolerated, or long-term medical therapy.\r"

A third group of six patients had symptomatic atlantoaxial instability. The mean atlanto-dens intervals and the mean spinal canal widths among the three groups were significantly different. There were no significant differences in mean composite neurologic scores and somatosensory evoked responses between patients in the asymptomatic group and those in the control group. However, when a subsample of patients with high and low latencies (greater than 1 SD below and above the mean) was formed and comparisons were made with roentgenographic findings, there was a high correspondence between somatosensory evoked potential latencies and atlanto-dens interval measurements. We conclude that no single assessment technique, but a combined approach using roentgenographic, CT scan, neurologic, and neurophysiologic investigations, will provide information of the risk status of patients with Down syndrome and atlantoaxial instability.\r"

Respiratory abnormalities were present in 85%, the majority caused by a primary problem of the pulmonary system, such as small thoracic cage or obstructed airway. Three patients had hypoxemia, recurrent cyanotic spells, and episodes of respiratory distress explainable only by cervicomedullary cord compression; in each patient, respiratory problems were alleviated by decompressive surgery. Another six patients with cervicomedullary compression had, in addition, at least one primary pulmonary cause of respiratory problems. After decompressive surgery the respiratory problems improved in three and were unchanged in three. Reconstructed sagittal CT images proved the most sensitive technique for detecting craniocervical stenosis as a cause of cervicomedullary cord compression, although some degree of stenosis was present in nearly all of the patients.\r"

However, this risk (19.6%) was much lower than the risk of 90% popularized by Smith and based on the study of Marden et al. (J Pediatr 1964;64:357). Analysis of the findings in the two studies showed that the lower predictive value was probably related to differences in study design.

Erythropoietin values were in the normal range (10 to 30 microU/mL) in 73% (58 of 80) of the patients with and 82% (54 of 66) of those without cyanosis. Elevated erythropoietin values in cyanotic patients were associated with lower mixed venous oxygen saturation and tension than in cyanotic patients with normal erythropoietin levels, even though the degree of polycythemia was similar. In contrast, most of the acyanotic patients who had elevated erythropoietin levels were anemic. Of the blood oxygen measurements, mixed venous oxygen saturation and tension had the closest inverse correlation with erythropoietin values. The normal erythropoietin values in most patients are in accord with other observations that show that an elevation in erythropoietin level in response to hypoxia will be transient if it results in a rise in hemoglobin concentration \"appropriate\" to the degree of hypoxia. Persistent elevation of erythropoietin in patients with congenital heart disease may indicate harmful impairment of hemoglobin production that is potentially correctable.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium and phosphorus retention was evaluated in 13 very low birth weight infants who were fed an experimental formula designed to deliver quantities of calcium and phosphorus sufficient to meet the intrauterine accretion rates for these minerals. Retention of calcium and phosphorus in slight excess of these rates was achieved without any apparent difficulties for the infants. Biochemical measurements demonstrated normal serum calcium (9.8 +/- 8 mg/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (242 +/- 51.6 IU) values. However, there was evidence of high tubular reabsorption of phosphate (98.1% +/- 3.3%), hypercalciuria (7.2 +/- 3.8 mg/kg/d), and a relatively low serum phosphorus concentration (5.7 +/- 0.6 mg/dL). This biochemical picture is similar to that seen in phosphorus deficiency except for the low alkaline phosphatase activity. The latter finding, in concert with the high retention of calcium and phosphorus in these balance studies, makes such a diagnosis unlikely. We speculate that this biochemical picture is the result of an inappropriately high calcium/phosphorus ratio.\r"

Serum Ca declined significantly in neonates at 24 hours of age, and was inversely correlated with serum calcitonin. Cord serum calcitonin, gastrin, and plasma glucagon concentrations rose significantly at 24 hours of age. Cord calcitonin was significantly higher in preterm compared with term infants, and there was no significant difference between asphyxiated and nonasphyxiated preterm neonates; in term neonates cord calcitonin concentration was inversely correlated with Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes. Cord calcitonin was not correlated with cord gastrin or glucagon. Cord and 24-hour gastrin and glucagon values were not related to prematurity; cord glucagon, but not gastrin, was related to birth asphyxia. We conclude that (1) serum calcitonin, gastrin, and plasma glucagon values rise postnatally; cord calcitonin is elevated in preterm and in asphyxiated term infants; serum calcitonin concentration does not correlate with the elevated serum gastrin and plasma glucagon values; and at 24 hours of age, decreased serum Ca is correlated with serum calcitonin, and hence calcitonin might play a role in the pathogenesis of early neonatal hypocalcemia.\r"

The dose of inositol, 40 mg/kg every 6 hours, was at least as high as amounts received in full preterm human milk feedings. Serum inositol concentration increased between days 2 and 3 from a mean of 566 mumol/L to 823 mumol/L in the infants given supplement and fell from 451 mumol/L to 292 mumol/L in the controls. On day 16, serum inositol values remained higher in the infants given supplement than in those given placebo (mean 334 mumol/L vs 146 mumol/L, P = 0.014). The infants who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia had significantly higher renal inositol clearance, lower inositol intake, and lower serum inositol concentrations. Inositol supplementation increased the saturated phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin ratio in tracheal aspirates. According to these results, supplementation with inositol in preterm infants leads to a rise in serum inositol concentration and improvement in the surfactant phospholipids. Inositol deserves further study as a dietary supplement for immature preterm infants who do not receive full human milk feeds.\r"

The stability of the AUC measurements despite changes in behavioral state was demonstrated by randomized block ANOVA. The sampling error was +/- 6.92%, with 95% confidence intervals of +/- 13.1%. By facilitating reproducible serial measurements of CBFV, this trend monitoring technique encourages a dynamic view of cerebrovascular control, and may be used to probe central nervous system autoregulatory pathophysiology and to evaluate the effects of therapeutic interventions.\r"

All 22 of the patients who received prednisone improved during the week of treatment, although one had a subsequent exacerbation 5 days after discontinuing the study medication. Of the 19 who received placebo, eight required rescue intervention (P = less than 0.004) in association with continued symptoms, increased frequency of metered-dose inhaler use, and decreased pulmonary function; the other 11 improved at about the same rate as those who received prednisone. Although the mean initial FEV1 was suggestively lower among those who did not improve and required intervention, there was considerable overlap with those who improved spontaneously, and no reliable distinguishing characteristics were found at entry into the study that could serve as predictors of those who would or would not improve spontaneously. There were no clinically important adverse effects from the prednisone. Because continued symptoms of asthma often result in emergency care or hospitalization, these data support early intervention with orally administered prednisone for acute exacerbations that do not respond fully to bronchodilators, at least in those patients with a prior history of a protracted course or emergency care.\r"

Sixty children aged 15 to 48 months (mean age 26.4 months) were studied by interviewing their mothers initially and after 3 years. Children with and without sleep disturbances were compared, with the latter serving as the control group. Twenty-five (42%: night waking, 22%; bedtime struggle, 13%; both night waking and bedtime struggle, 7%) of 60 children had sleep disturbances at the initial interview, and of these 25 children, 21 (84%) had persistence of sleep disturbances after 3 years, persistent sleep disturbances had a significant relationship with increased frequency of stress factors in the environment (P less than 0.01). Other generalized behavior difficulties were present in 30% of sleep-disturbed and 19% of non-sleep-disturbed children (P = NS). Co-sleeping (sleeping with a parent or sibling) was noted more frequently in sleep-disturbed (34%) than in non-sleep-disturbed (16%) children. Twenty percent of the mothers at initial interview and 30% at 3-year follow-up perceived their child's sleep disturbances as stressful to them and to their family life. Early identification of the child with sleep disturbances and timely intervention would help both the child and the family.\r"

This Revised PDQ (R-PDQ) identified 84% of nonnormal DDST results. Test-retest reliability over 1 week was 94.1%, and parent-teacher agreement was 83%. A field test of the R-PDQ, conducted in a variety of settings with 1434 children, revealed that suspect scores on first-stage screening varied with the setting, from 15.6% in private pediatric practices to 50.5% in Head Start and urban day care centers. Parents found the R-PDQ interesting and easy to complete; health professionals found it economical and easy to interpret. We recommend that the R-PDQ be coupled with a brief developmental examination, and that the R-PDQ be used in busy office settings and community mass screening programs.\r"

  ".W": "A statistically significant decrease in the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors was observed in renal membranes of rats beginning 2 weeks after adrenalectomy when compared with sham-operated controls. This decrease in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density was manifest as a decrease in the maximum binding of two ligands, [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195, without accompanying changes in their Kd for this site. Similar changes were not seen in another aldosterone-sensitive organ, the submandibular salivary gland. The decrease in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density observed in adrenalectomized rat renal membranes was restored to control levels after 1 week of aldosterone administration using a dose (12.5 micrograms/kg/day) that had no effect on peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in sham-operated animals. In contrast, dexamethasone administration (50 micrograms/kg/day, 1 week) had no effect on renal peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density when administered to either adrenalectomized or sham-operated rats. Further, adrenal demedullation had no effect on renal peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density or affinity. The decrease in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density was localized to the renal cortex and the outer stripe of the medulla by gross dissection of renal slices and renal tissue section autoradiography. The specific effect of adrenalectomy on renal peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density, the lack of direct effect of aldosterone on [3H] Ro 5-4864 binding and the localization of the change in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density to the renal cortex and outer stripe suggest that these changes may reflect an adaptation of the renal nephron (possibly the distal convoluted tubule, intermediate tubule and/or the collecting duct) to the loss of mineralocorticoid hormones.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effects of an inotropic agent, milrinone, on the entire cardiovascular system, we developed an intact dog model to assess the responses of the heart, arterial and venous circulations. At a dose that increased left ventricular dP/dt by 30% (P less than .001) from 2033 +/- 133 to 2688 +/- 140 mm Hg/sec, milrinone caused a decrease (P less than .001) in mean aortic pressure from 88.4 +/- 3.5 to 73.1 +/- 3.0 mm Hg and cardiac output from 148.0 +/- 14.6 to 134.5 +/- 13.9 ml/kg/min. Heart rate increased (P less than .01) from 124 +/- 8 to 135 +/- 8 beats/min. Systemic vascular resistance did not change. Right atrial pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased (P less than .01). Total blood volume did not change but central blood volume decreased (P less than .01) from 26.1 +/- 0.9 to 22.3 +/- 0.5 ml/kg. After milrinone administration, mean circulatory filling pressure decreased (P less than .01) by 30% from 7.4 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.2 mm Hg. Vascular or venous compliance increased (P less than .05) slightly from 1.96 +/- 0.4 to 2.20 +/- 0.1 ml/mm Hg/kg. This was accompanied by an increase (P less than .01) in unstressed vascular blood volume of 3.3 +/- 0.6 ml/kg. Arterial compliance also increased (P less than .05). In summary, milrinone produces an increase in inotropy, arterial vasodilatation and venodilatation as evidenced by the increased venous compliance and unstressed vascular volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87169242\r", 
  ".W": "[3H]-5-Hydroxytryptamine ([3H]-5-HT) decomposes rapidly when exposed to air in solution at physiological pH if antioxidants are not present. The decomposition products appear to bind to two saturable sites on brain membranes (apparent Kd values = 1-2 and 100-1000 nM). This binding mimics \"specific\" ligand/receptor binding in that it is inhibited by 10 microM unlabeled 5-HT. This inhibition is not competitive, but rather is due to the prevention of [3H]-5-HT breakdown by excess unlabeled 5-HT. Unlike genuine ligand/receptor binding, the binding of [3H]-5-HT breakdown products is essentially irreversible and does not display a tissue distribution consistent with binding to authentic 5-HT receptors. [3H]-5-HT decomposition can be eliminated by the inclusion of 0.05 to 5 mM ascorbic acid. At these concentrations ascorbic acid is not deleterious to reversible [3H]-5-HT binding. When [3H] 5-HT exposure to air occurs in the presence of brain membranes, the apparent antioxidant activity of brain membranes themselves affords protection against [3H]-5-HT degradation equal to ascorbic acid. This protection is effective below final [3H]-5-HT concentrations of 10 nM. Above 10 nM [3H]-5-HT, addition of ascorbic acid or other antioxidants is necessary to avoid the occurrence of additional low affinity (apparent Kd = 15-2000 nM) binding sites that are specific but nonetheless irreversible. When care is taken to limit [3H]-5-HT oxidation, the only reversible and saturable specific binding sites observed are of the 5-HT1 high affinity (Kd = 1-2 nM) type. Radioligand oxidation artifacts may be involved in previous reports of low affinity (Kd = 15-250 nM) [3H]-5-HT binding sites in brain membrane preparations.\r"

  ".W": "Using the rabbit kidney slice model of active tubular secretion, I studied the active accumulation of penicillin (PEN) in the absence and presence of competing drugs to evaluate the feasibility of using in vitro uptake to predict in vivo secretion. Active accumulation of PEN by these slices was saturable at high PEN concentrations and was inhibited by incubation conditions which decreased ATP production. PEN uptake in the presence of 1 mM concentrations of mannitol, tolazoline and tetraethylammonium was unchanged. However, PEN uptake in the presence of eight weak organic acid drugs (probenecid, phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, salicylate, sulfamethizole, chlorothiazide, sulfamethoxypyridazine and indomethacin) was inhibited significantly. This inhibition appeared to be competitive in nature and the inhibitor-transport carrier protein dissociation constant (Ki) for each inhibitory drug was calculated (range, 0.38-74.8 X 10(-5) M). When these values for Ki obtained with PEN were compared to values obtained with methotrexate and p- aminohippurate, the values of Ki were similar, implying the presence of a similar transport carrier protein for PEN, methotrexate and p-aminohippurate. The effects of these eight drugs upon PEN clearance in vivo were extrapolated from the medical literature. The relative inhibitory strengths of these drugs based upon in vitro findings (drug plasma concentration/Ki ratios) and clinical findings (inhibition of PEN clearance) were concordant. This in vitro model for assessing inhibition of renal tubular secretion may be of general utility in predicting clinically important drug interactions between weak organic acid drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In vitro, [14C] diphenhydramine was accumulated by a saturable, energy-requiring system in choroid plexus. In vivo, 20 min after intraventricular injection into rabbits, [14C]diphenhydramine was cleared from cerebrospinal fluid much more rapidly than [3H]sucrose, a molecule transported in the central nervous system by simple diffusion. In vivo, employing the in situ rat brain perfusion technique, [14C]diphenhydramine was cleared from the cerebral perfusion fluid as rapidly as [14C]diazepam. However, the clearance of [14C]diphenhydramine, but not [14C]diazepam, was inhibited by the addition of 10 mM unlabeled diphenhydramine to the perfusate. These in vivo and in vitro results show that diphenhydramine, unlike diazepam, is transported between blood, brain and cerebrospinal fluid, in part, by saturable, carrier-mediated transport processes at both the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers.\r"

Infusion (i.v.) of equipressor doses of cirazoline and B-HT 933, 0.04 and 4 mg/kg/hr, respectively, decreased renal plasma flow without changing glomerular filtration rate. Cirazoline infusion did not affect urinary excretion of water, electrolytes or total solutes. In marked contrast, B-HT 933 increased urine flow and sodium excretion significantly (P less than .01) but did not significantly alter potassium and urea excretion. Urine osmolality decreased to hyposmotic levels (from 613 +/- 86 to 172 +/- 8 mOsmol/kg of H2O) during the infusion of B-HT 933, suggesting a possible interaction between the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist and the vasopressin system. This diuretic action of the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist was also observed after the i.v. infusion of a subpressor dose (0.4 mg/kg/hr) of B-HT 933. In rats treated with the ganglionic blocker, hexamethonium (10 mg/kg i.v.), the B-HT 933-induced diuresis was not affected, confirming an action in the periphery, possibly at the level of the kidney. These results suggest that stimulation of renal alpha-2 adrenoceptors in conscious, euvolumic rats modulates the reabsorption of water and sodium at the site of the renal nephron.\r"

The phosphoinositides in rat cerebral cortex were labeled with [myo-3H]inositol and the effects of the drugs on the formation of the following inositol phosphates were determined: inositol 1-phosphate (IP); inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (IP2); mixture of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (IP3). Termination of the hydrolysis by trichloroacetic acid resulted in lower basal levels and more reproducible results than termination by water lysis or a chloroform-methanol mixture (CHCl3-MeOH). The amounts of IP and IP2 formed by a maximal concentration of veratrine were about one half of that formed by a maximal concentration of norepinephrine although the amount of IP3 formed after stimulation by veratrine was only about 10% of that produced by norepinephrine. The increase in IP was linear with time (30 min) for both norepinephrine and veratrine. Stimulation of IP2 and IP3 formation by veratrine reached a maximum at 5 min whereas that produced by norepinephrine continued to increase for 30 min. Blockade of voltage-dependent calcium channels with manganese produced nearly complete antagonism of the veratrine response while only partially antagonizing the norepinephrine response. Norepinephrine-induced IP2 formation was less sensitive to manganese than was formation of IP or IP3. These data suggest that either veratrine and norepinephrine cause hydrolysis of different pools of phosphoinositide or that the hydrolysis occurs by different mechanisms. The data also suggest that IP and IP2 may be produced directly from phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate rather than solely as a metabolite of IP3.\r"

  ".W": "The binding of the cage convulsant, [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS), to a picrotoxin-sensitive site in rat cerebral cortical homogenates was used to identify and characterize the site of action of the phenylquinolines PK 8165 and PK 9084, the isoquinoline PK 11195 and the atypical benzodiazepine (BZ) Ro5 4864. These agents were found to allosterically modulate the binding of 2 nM [35S]TBPS in a pharmacologically relevant fashion. Evidence is presented to suggest that these compounds share a common site of action as modulators of [35S]TBPS binding. The relative potencies of these compounds in vitro are in the submicromolar to micromolar concentration range and correlate well with the concentrations reported to elicit specific responses in behavioral and electrophysiologic studies. Modulation of [35S]TBPS binding in vitro is affected by micromolar quantities of gamma-aminobutyric acid in a (+)-bicuculline-sensitive fashion and is unaffected by the central BZ receptor \"antagonist\" Ro15 1788. Collectively, the evidence presented suggests the existence of a novel drug binding site that is functionally coupled to a gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor and a [35S]TBPS-labeled chloride ionophore. Moreover, this site is distinct from the central BZ receptor recognized by clonazepam and the high-affinity peripheral BZ binding site labeled by [3H] Ro5 4864. The hypothesis is proposed that the novel \"Ro5 4864 site\" identified in the present study is a functionally relevant binding site that mediates some of the pharmacologic effects of Ro5 4864, PK 8165, PK 9084 and PK 11195 in the mammalian central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether thiamine deficiency (TD), a frequent concomitant of chronic alcoholism, differentially modifies the response to ethanol in two inbred rat strains with highly different genetic susceptibilities to development of TD encephalopathy. Ethanol-induced (3 g/kg i.p.) behavioral impairment and hypothermia were studied after 2, 5 and 7 weeks of TD and after 6 weeks of repletion on normal diet. Controls of the M520/N (TD-sensitive) strain metabolized ethanol more rapidly, had a greater liver to body weight ratio, greater total body water, earlier and lower peak blood ethanol concentrations (BEC), diminished area under the BEC curve and lesser behavioral impairment and hypothermia (even at equivalent BEC values) than those of the F344/N (TD-resistant) strain. In both strains, TD resulted in reduced ethanol metabolic rate and liver to body weight ratio and equivalent ethanol-induced hypothermia and behavioral impairment at lower BEC. Lower and delayed peak BEC and unchanged area under the BEC curve suggest an increased volume of ethanol distribution during TD. Recovery appeared complete after 6 weeks of normal diet. Both strains lost an equivalent proportion of body weight during TD but M520/N rats had lesser decrements in ethanol metabolic rate, had greater reductions in liver weight, peak BEC and baseline body temperature and developed overt encephalopathy whereas F344/N rats did not. Therefore, in the chronic alcoholic, TD may modify ethanol's effects via pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Relatively high ethanol tolerance of the strain with a genetic predisposition to TD encephalopathy is consistent with the hypothesized role of this avitaminosis in the pharmacogenetics of alcoholism.\r"

Virtually complete depletion of norepinephrine occurred in both right and left atria and ventricles after doses of 1.0 mg/kg/day of reserpine for one or more days of pretreatment. A smaller dose, 0.3 mg/kg/day, produced lesser depletion, and a larger dose, 2.5 mg/kg/day, caused severe central nervous system depression and high mortality. Chronic treatment (5 days or longer) with the 1.0-mg/kg/day dose produced supersensitivity of right atria to the chronotropic, but not inotropic, responses to isoproterenol. Chronic treatment with this dose for 7 days produced inotropic supersensitivity in left atria. Most of the schedules of pretreatment with reserpine depressed the maximum response to tyramine. However, the data indicate that the tyramine-releasable norepinephrine was not a consistent reflection of the total norepinephrine pool, even when depletion was very pronounced. The effects of depletion of cardiac stores of norepinephrine with reserpine in comparison with the effects of cardiac sympathectomy are discussed.\r"

CTP (100, 300, 1000 nM) produced concentration-dependent antagonism of the mu agonist [Me-Phe3,D-Pro4]morphiceptin (PL017) in both the GPI and MVD. Schild analysis of the interactions between CTP and PL017 indicated competitive antagonism between these peptides (Schild slope GPI -0.97 +/- 0.16, Schild slope MVD -1.4 +/- 0.4), and also suggested that the mu receptors in the two tissues are not different (pA2 GPI 7.1 +/- 0.17, pA2 MVD 6.9 +/- 0.16). The effects of the delta selective agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin in the MVD were not antagonized by CTP. Likewise, in the GPI, CTP did not antagonize the kappa agonist (trans-3-4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl)benzenea cetamine (U50, 488H). In comparison, naloxone antagonized both PL017 and U50,488H in the GPI, as well as [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin and PL017 in the MVD. In the MVD, CTP also exerted weak somatostatin-like actions (35% maximal inhibition) that could not be demonstrated in somatostatin-tolerant tissues. It also showed inhibitory actions at very high concentrations (3000 and 10,000 nM) that were blocked by both naloxone and the delta antagonist N,N-diallyl-Tyr-AIB-AIB-Phe-Leu-OH (ICI 174,864). ICI 174,864 antagonized [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin in the MVD, but did not affect PL017.

The rates of inward Ca++ transport were faster in light SR compared to heavy SR, but no statistically significant difference was observed among MH diagnostic groups. Spontaneous Ca++ release occurred at optimum Ca++ preload in all SR fractions and this preload did not differ among MH diagnostic groups. Optimal Ca++ preload for rate of spontaneously released Ca++ was greater in light SR compared to heavy SR. Similarly, rate of Ca++ release was faster in light SR than in heavy SR, but no difference in rate of spontaneously released Ca++ was observed among MH diagnostic groups. Amount of Ca++ released did not differ among SR fractions and it did not differ among diagnostic groups. In contrast to previous studies showing a defect in Ca++-induced Ca++ release, the mechanisms related to spontaneous Ca++ release and to oxalate-facilitated inward Ca++ transport, as measured in this study, appear to be normal in SR from human MH skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Eight acetamide analogs of oxotremorine, shown previously to be full or nearly full muscarinic agonists on the isolated guinea pig ileum, were investigated for muscarinic activity on muscle strips of guinea pig urinary bladder. Several compounds demonstrated pronounced organ selectivity when compared to carbachol by being partial agonists or antagonists on the bladder. For example, oxotremorine and BM 34, both potent, full agonists on the ileum, were partial agonists, the latter producing less than one-half the maximum response of carbachol. BM 5 elicited no significant response, but instead was a potent antagonist to carbachol. Schild analysis with BM 5 and BM 61 indicated no muscarinic receptor heterogeneity between the bladder and ileum. Also dissociation constants of agonists and partial agonists generally agreed with those determined previously on the ileum. Furthermore, the relative efficacy of each agonist appeared to be similar in the two tissues, confirming the homogeneity of muscarinic receptors in the bladder and ileum with respect to the compounds studied. Compounds having high affinity and low intrinsic efficacy, e.g., BM 5, thus may stimulate contractile responses on the ileum and block responses on the bladder and therefore display tissue selectivity without discriminating between tissue receptors. It is suggested that this selectivity is derived from a smaller effective receptor reserve for muscarinic agonists in the bladder.\r"

Cl- was substituted in the superfusion medium to varying degrees with the impermeant anions isethionate, methanesulfonate or gluconate. The sodium concentration was held constant. Apomorphine (30 nM), a DA receptor agonist, inhibited the stimulation-evoked (1 Hz, 2 min) release of both DA and ACh in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate medium (KRB; 125.4 mM Cl-). The inhibitory effects of the agonist were not altered significantly in media containing 66.4 mM Cl-. In 7.4 mM Cl- medium (isethionate replacement), apomorphine-induced inhibition of DA release was reduced (40% inhibition vs. 67% inhibition in KRB). Similarly, apomorphine inhibition of ACh release was lowered from 38% in KRB to 25% in 7.4 mM Cl-. The muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (10 microM) inhibited the stimulation-evoked release of ACh while enhancing the evoked release of DA in normal Cl- (125.4 mM) medium. Inhibition of ACh release was not altered in 66.4 mM Cl- media but was increased in 7.4 mM Cl- (63% inhibition in low Cl- vs. 50% in KRB). The enhancing effects of carbachol on stimulated DA release were potentiated in 66.4 mM Cl- (88% enhancement vs. 57% in KRB), whereas no change in the agonist effect was observed in the lower Cl- medium (7.4 mM Cl-).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats were rendered tolerant to etorphine by s.c. implantation of osmotic minipumps containing 3 mg/ml of etorphine for up to 7 days. During this period, there were a time-dependent increase in the AD50 values of etorphine to inhibit the tail-flick response and an increase in naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs. When these animals and others were sacrificed and the opiate receptor binding properties were examined, it could be demonstrated that there was also a time-dependent decrease in the amount of [3H]diprenorphine specifically bound, with maximal attenuation reached 3 days after implantation. There was no alteration in alpha 2 adrenergic receptor binding. This observed decrease in [3H]diprenorphine binding was not due to the presence of nonwashed etorphine in the membrane, for acute administration of the same dose of etorphine before sacrificing did not produce an attenuation of the opiate receptor binding. Further examination of opiate receptor binding in the brain regions of cortex, midbrain and striatum revealed the greatest decrease in the amount of [3H]diprenorphine bound in striatal region after chronic etorphine treatment, a 68% decrease. When the relative decrease in mu and delta opioid receptor binding was determined by carrying out [3H]-D-Ala2, DLeu5-enkephalin binding in the presence of 1 microM morphiceptin, it was observed that, 3 days after etorphine treatment, there was a decrease in mu opioid receptor binding, with minimal change in delta opioid receptor binding in both brain regions of striatum and midbrain. Only in cortex was a decrease in binding of both receptor subtypes observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In humans, TPMT activity is inherited as a monogenic trait. It would be useful if there were an animal model in which the genetic regulation of TPMT could be studied. Average TPMT activities in livers of C57BL/6J (B6) and AKR/J (AK) mice were only 17 to 29% of average activities in livers of like-sexed DBA/2J (D2) mice. Average TPMT activities in kidneys of B6 and AK mice were only 41 to 45% of average activities in kidneys of like-sexed D2 mice. Breeding experiments were performed to study the possible role of inheritance in regulating variations in TPMT activity in these mice. TPMT activities in livers and kidneys of F1 (hybrid) animals (N = 38) from D2 X B6 matings were intermediate to those in the parental strains but were closer to D2 than to B6 values, an observation that suggested partial dominance of the D2 phenotype. The results of studies of F2 (N = 107) and backcross (N = 102) animals derived from these matings were compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance of the trait of low TPMT activity in these mouse strains. Of the F2 animals, 27.1% were included in a \"low\" TPMT subgroup when enzyme activities in livers and kidneys were both used for phenotypic classification. TPMT activities in livers and kidneys of F1 mice (N = 40) from D2 X AK matings were also intermediate to those in the parental strains but were closer to D2 than to AK values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study tests the hypothesis that opiates stimulate PRL secretion through a serotonergic mechanism in adult rats, but a nonserotonergic mechanism in neonatal rats. Morphine stimulated PRL secretion in adult and neonatal (10-day-old) rats and this increase was blocked with the opiate antagonist naloxone. Ten-day-old or adult rats were pretreated with the serotonin antagonist, cyproheptadine (CYPRO), or the neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). Both CYPRO and 5,7-DHT attenuated the PRL response to morphine in adult but not neonatal rats. 5,7-DHT decreased serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid substantially in the hypothalamus. When rats were pretreated with 5,7-DHT several weeks before morphine challenge, serotonin depletion was more pronounced, but the PRL response to morphine was not decreased. In addition, the PRL response to 5-hydroxytryptophan was greatly potentiated, suggesting that functional supersensitivity developed in the 5,7-DHT-treated animals. The ability of CYPRO and 5,7-DHT to block the serotonergic component of a different morphine-induced behavior in the neonate was tested using the tail immersion test for analgesia. Morphine produced profound antinociception in the rat pup which was attenuated markedly by 5,7-DHT and CYPRO. These studies demonstrate that opiates mediate their stimulatory effects on PRL release, at least in part, through a serotonergic mechanism in adult rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced humoral immune suppression is mediated by reactive intermediates was tested in female B6C3F1 mice using three approaches. First, distribution of reactive species to known target organs (liver and kidney) and to immune organs (peripheral blood components, bone marrow cells, thymus and spleen) was demonstrated by monitoring acid-insoluble radioactivity after single or multiple doses of 6 mg/kg and 2 microCi of [methyl-14C] DMN. Most of the radioactivity resided in acid-insoluble material, which increased with the number of exposures and correlated with suppression of the in vivo antibody response to sheep erythrocytes as determined by enumerating immunoglobulin M antibody-forming cells. Fractionation of spleens from exposed animals into various cell types indicated greater association of acid-insoluble radioactivity with T- and B-lymphocytes as compared to macrophages. Fractionation of spleen cell lysates into protein, DNA and RNA indicated that most radioactivity was associated with the nucleic acid component. Pretreatment of mice with aminoacetonitrile reduced acid-insoluble disintegrations per minute in the spleen. The second approach was to demonstrate the immunosuppressive nature of compounds forming the same toxic intermediate as DMN. The addition of N-nitroso(acetoxymethyl)methylamine to spleen cell cultures resulted in completely suppressed in vitro antibody responses to sheep erythrocytes and dinitrophenylated Ficoll at micromolar concentrations. The third approach involved activating DMN to an immunosuppressive form in vitro. Preincubation of splenocytes with Aroclor-induced mouse hepatocytes resulted in activation of DMN to intermediates capable of markedly suppressing the response of antibody-forming cells to sheep erythrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "In pithed rats, nifedipine (i.a., -15 min) maximally shifted the alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated log dose-pressor response curve to i.v. (-)-phenylephrine 5-fold to the right, doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg being equieffective. Phenoxybenzamine (3-1000 micrograms/kg i.v., -60 min) enhanced the potency of nifedipine, expressed as -log ID50, to inhibit the vasopressor response to (-)-phenylephrine. After treatment with 0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine a dose of 1 mg/kg of nifedipine was sufficient to virtually eliminate the pressor responses. The potentiating effect of phenoxybenzamine was already present at a low dose of 3 micrograms/kg, which by itself had no influence on the log dose-pressor response curve to (-)-phenylephrine. It was also clearly limited, inasmuch as the -log ID50 values of nifedipine determined after treatment with 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine were identical and similar to the value reported for nifedipine against alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction in pithed rats. Infusion of vasopressin to counteract the vasodilatory action of nifedipine did not affect its inhibitory potency compared to the effectiveness quantified under the conditions of reduced baseline diastolic pressure. The data support the conclusions that the resistance of the pressor response to (-)-phenylephrine (and other full alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists) to inhibition by nifedipine (or other Ca++ channel blockers) is due to the dual nature of the Ca++ utilization in the vasoconstriction to these stimulants, i.e., transmembranous influx of extracellular Ca++ (sensitive to Ca++ channel blockers) and a mobilization of intracellular Ca++ (insensitive to Ca++ channel blockers).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous structure-activity and pharmacologic studies with duodenal ulcerogens cysteamine and propionitrile implicating catecholamines in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration have now been followed up by dose- and time-response biochemical investigations to assess the importance of monoamines in the development of duodenal ulcers. The concentrations of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites were measured in total brain, brain regions, stomach, duodenum, pancreas and adrenals in the rat. Turnover of catecholamines was determined in rats pretreated with the inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The duodenal ulcerogens caused a dose- and time-dependent depletion of norepinephrine in virtually all the tissues examined. The effect was maximal 4 or 7 hr after cysteamine or propionitrile, and norepinephrine levels returned to normal in 24 hr. Dopamine changes were selective and often biphasic, e.g., elevation in adrenals, biphasic in brain cortex, hippocampus and midbrain, but uniformly decreasing in glandular stomach and duodenum. In the median eminence dopamine levels decreased by 181 and 324% at 15 and 30 min, respectively, after cysteamine, but neither dopamine nor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was modified in the periventricular nucleus. Serotonin levels were relatively stable, revealing slight elevations or no changes in most of the tissues. The turnover of norepinephrine was accelerated by both chemicals in virtually all brain regions, but dopamine turnover was affected only in a few areas, e.g., in the corpus striatum and medulla oblongata cysteamine decreased dopamine turnover, whereas propionitrile first (at 1 hr) accelerated then (at 8 hr) significantly suppressed it.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Duodenal ulcers were produced by administering cysteamine to rats. Pretreatment with the catecholamine precursor, L-tyrosine (40 mg/100 g i.p. for 5 days), decreased the intensity of duodenal ulcers induced by cysteamine. Equimolar doses of tyrosine methyl ester (51.2 mg/100 g i.p. or s.c.) were equally effective in reducing ulcer intensity. Other amino acids (i.e., alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, leucine, lysine, tryptophan and valine) did not prevent experimental duodenal ulcers. Coadministration of other large neutral amino acids (e.g., leucine and valine) that compete with tyrosine for uptake into the brain did not inhibit the effect of tyrosine on duodenal ulcers induced by cysteamine. Gastric, duodenal and brain dopamine concentrations were increased 1 hr after the injection of tyrosine methyl ester (25.6 mg/100 g s.c.). These results suggest that the effect of tyrosine on duodenal ulcer induced by cysteamine may be mediated by changes in gastrointestinal dopamine metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Dose- and time-response studies have been performed with dopamine agonists and antagonists using the cysteamine and propionitrile duodenal ulcer models in the rat. The experiments demonstrate that the chemically induced duodenal ulcer is prevented by bromocriptine, lergotrile and reduced by apomorphine or L-dopa. Aggravation of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer was seen especially after (-)-butaclamol, (-)-sulpiride, haloperidol and, less effectively, after other dopaminergic antagonists. The duodenal antiulcerogenic action of dopamine agonists was more prominent after chronic administration than after a single dose, whereas the opposite was found concerning the proulcerogenic effect of dopamine antagonists. In the chronic gastric fistula rat, both the antiulcerogens bromocriptine or lergotrile and the proulcerogens haloperidol, pimozide or (-)-N-(2-chlorethyl)-norapomorphine decreased the cysteamine- or propionitrile-induced gastric secretion. No correlation was apparent between the influence of these drugs on duodenal ulcer development and gastric and duodenal (pancreatic/biliary) secretions. In the chronic duodenal fistula rat, decreased acid content was measured in the proximal duodenum after haloperidol, and diminished duodenal pepsin exposure was recorded after bromocriptine. Furthermore, the aggravation by dopamine antagonists of experimental duodenal ulcer probably involves a peripheral component. The site of dopamine receptors and physiologic effects which modulate experimental duodenal ulcer remain to be identified, but their elucidation may prove to be an important element in the pathogenesis and treatment of duodenal ulcer.\r"

The agonists were given directly into the lateral cerebral ventricle (i.c.v.) or into the lumbar spinal subarachnoid space (intrathecal), and the potency of each compound was compared across injection sites and with data previously obtained in a thermal analgesic test (mouse hot-plate test). The rank order of potency for inhibition of writhing after i.c.v. administration was DAGO greater than DADLE greater than morphine greater than DPDPE; KC and U50 showed no significant activity by this route. After intrathecal administration, the compounds inhibited writhing with a rank potency order of DAGO greater than KC greater than morphine = DADLE greater than DPDPE greater than U50. All compounds were more potent in inhibiting writhing at spinal sites than at supraspinal sites; DPDPE and DAGO were 15 and 24 times more potent after intrathecal than after i.c.v. administration, respectively. The proposed delta agonists DPDPE and DADLE inhibited writhing at both spinal and supraspinal sites. Further, although the proposed kappa-acting compounds KC and U50 were effective at relatively low doses at spinal levels, these compounds lacked activity at supraspinal sites at doses not causing sedation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These findings are consistent with accumulated evidence indicating that, in addition to their analgesic and behavioral effects in the adult, endogenous opioid peptides and opioid receptors may be involved as mediators of tissue growth and function in the neonate. This study examines the effects of N alpha-acetyl-beta-endorphin on tissue ODC activity to determine whether post-translational acetylation of beta-endorphin at the N alpha-terminus affects its capability to alter ODC activity and, consequently, tissue development. Intracisternal administration of N alpha-acetyl-beta-endorphin evoked profound increases in brain ODC activity in 6- and 9-day-old rats, whereas normal ODC levels were observed in 25-day-old animals and in adult rats. Centrally administered N alpha-acetyl-beta-endorphin had no effect on ODC in peripheral tissues. In contrast, s.c. administration of this peptide to 6-day-old animals resulted in marked increases in ODC activity in the heart, liver and brain. Naloxone inhibited the stimulatory actions of N alpha-acetyl-beta-endorphin on brain ODC completely, indicating the involvement of opioid receptors in that process. On the other hand, the increases in liver ODC were not prevented by naloxone, suggesting that these effects are not mediated through opioid-sensitive structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifteen subjects were assigned randomly to one of three groups. Each group received, by i.m. injection, placebo and three doses of one active drug, twice in randomized block order under double-blind conditions in 4.5-hr experimental sessions. Physiological measures did not differentiate between the three drugs. All three drugs decreased respiratory rate and pupil diameter and increased blood pressure. However, morphine, ciramadol and pentazocine produced different profiles on the subjective effect measures. All three drugs increased \"liking,\" \"good effects,\" \"any effects\" and \"high\" subjective effect scales. Pentazocine increased subjective \"bad effects\" scale scores and scales measuring dysphoria and sedation. Observers reported significant behavioral changes after administration of morphine and pentazocine, but not after ciramadol. Overall, the effects of morphine (7.5, 15 and 30 mg) and pentazocine (22.5, 45 and 90 mg) were dose-related. Although pentazocine produced increases in scales that indicated negative subjective effects, it also produced significant changes in most self-report measures that were increased by morphine, including liking and good effects scales. The effects of ciramadol were not dose-related, with all three doses (30, 60 and 120 mg) producing effects approximately equivalent to morphine 15 mg. Thus, ciramadol exhibited a ceiling effect typical of the opioid agonist/antagonist.\r"

The present data confirm these findings and demonstrate that Na loading enhances the vasoconstrictor effects of CHA in the isolated rat kidney perfused at constant flow. Furthermore, adenosine receptor antagonism with both theophylline and the A1-selective antagonist, xanthine amine congener (8-[4-[(2-aminoethyl)-aminocarbonylmethyloxy]phenyl]-1, 3-dipropylxanthine), produced a rightward and apparently parallel shift in the dose response to CHA. Determination of the inhibitory constants for both antagonists revealed that xanthine amine congener was three orders of magnitude more potent than theophylline in antagonizing CHA-induced renal vasoconstriction. Other investigators have hypothesized that angiotensin II mediates adenosine-induced renal vasoconstriction. However, we have been able to show that A1 receptor activation can result in renal vasoconstriction in the isolated perfused rat kidney devoid of renin substrate. Moreover, a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II (saralasin) failed to attenuate the hemodynamic effects of CHA at doses that completely blocked the effects of angiotensin II itself. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that A1 receptor activation in the kidney leads to vasoconstriction, a response that is enhanced by Na loading, and that A1 adenosine receptors and angiotensin II receptors are separate and distinct biochemical entities. Independent activation of either receptor leads to renal vasoconstriction, which can be prevented by its respective antagonist.\r"

In vehicle-treated control rats, PGF2 alpha excretion ranged from 32.2 +/- 6.2 (mean +/- S.E.M.) to 41.6 +/- 7.3 ng/6 h, and was 2- to 4-fold higher than that of PGE2. Within 6 h of administration all three drugs reduced excretion of PGF2 alpha and PGE2 to less than 20% and 35% of control rats, respectively. Thereafter, PGF2 alpha and PGE2 excretion in aspirin-treated rats returned to values similar to the vehicle-treated group, whereas inhibition of PG excretion in indomethacin and flurbiprofen groups was sustained. Urine volume was doubled by aspirin throughout the study. In contrast, urine volume in flurbiprofen- and indomethacin-treated rats was unaffected. Paradoxically, metabolism of 1-[14C]arachidonic acid to PGs by renal papilla dissected on day 10, 2 to 4 h after the last drug dose, was reduced markedly by aspirin as was the release of immunoreactive PGs but was unaffected by flurbiprofen or indomethacin. The failure of long-term aspirin treatment to inhibit urinary PG excretion and the disparity between in vivo and ex vivo indices of PG release emphasize the need to verify their intended action by measuring PGs in biological fluids.\r"

  ".W": "Local anesthetics were used to probe differences in the binding of [3H]nitrendipine to dihydropyridine calcium antagonist binding sites on rat brain and cardiac membranes. Local anesthetics inhibited [3H]nitrendipine binding to brain and cardiac membranes with the rank order of potency, dibucaine = proadifen much greater than tetracaine greater than meproadifen greater than RAC-109 (S) greater than RAC-109 (R) greater than benzocaine. Lidocaine, procaine, piperocaine and bupivacaine produced either a small potentiation or inhibition of [3H]nitrendipine binding. Dibucaine inhibited [3H]nitrendipine binding to brain membranes (IC50, 4.9 +/- 0.5 microM) by increasing the Kd, whereas in cardiac membranes (IC50, 8.5 +/- 0.9 microM) it both increased the Kd and decreased the maximum binding site capacity of [3H]nitrendipine. The potency of dibucaine to inhibit [3H]nitrendipine binding was reduced in both tissues by monovalent (Li+ greater than Na+ = K+ = Rb+; EC50, 40-50 mM) and divalent (Ca++, Mg++ and Mn++; EC50, 10-50 microM) cations. These cations reduced the effect of dibucaine on the Kd of [3H]nitrendipine in brain and on the maximum binding site capacity of [3H]nitrendipine in cardiac membranes. Inhibition of [3H]nitrendipine binding by dibucaine was best described by high (2 microM) and low (50 microM) affinity sites. The apparent affinities of these sites, but not the fractional occupancies, were similar in brain and cardiac membranes. Na+ modulated the occupancies of these sites in brain, but not in cardiac membranes, whereas Ca++ inhibited occupancy of the high affinity site in both tissues. The effects of Li+ were similar to those of Ca++. These findings indicate that brain and cardiac dihydropyridine calcium antagonist binding sites are coupled to different allosteric effectors or exist in a different membrane environment.\r"

  ".W": "Although studies in isolated hepatocytes have demonstrated that hypoxia adversely affects drug conjugation, the impact of hypoxia on drug elimination by conjugation in the intact liver has not been defined. This study in the isolated perfused rat liver examines the effect of acute hypoxia on the hepatic elimination of harmol, a phenolic compound eliminated by conjugation without first undergoing oxidative metabolism. In the preparation used in these experiments, harmol glucuronide is the major metabolite (greater than 80%), with the remainder being sulfate. The hypoxic insult consisted of an 80% reduction of hepatic oxygen delivery for 1 hr. During normal oxygenation, a 20-mumol dose was rapidly eliminated (T1/2 = 4.3 +/- 0.8 min; mean +/- S.D., n = 5). A second dose given after 30 min of hypoxia was eliminated much more slowly (T1/2 = 21 +/- 7.9 min, P less than .01). Upon reoxygenation, T1/2 recovered to 4.2 +/- 0.5 min. Similar effects were observed in steady-state experiments, in which perfusate levels rose from 15.7 +/- 1.3 microM to 31.0 +/- 1.6 microM (P less than .005) during hypoxia, indicating a fall in harmol clearance of at least 50%. In each group of experiments, there was a significant reduction in both the formation and elimination of harmol conjugates during hypoxia. Upon reoxygenation, harmol conjugation recovered, but conjugate elimination remained significantly impaired. The authors conclude that acute hypoxia slows the hepatic elimination of harmol by reducing drug conjugation, an effect that is promptly reversed by reoxygenation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In pithed rats, blood pressure dose-response curves to i.v. cirazoline, methoxamine and phenylephrine (full alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists) exhibited higher maxima than those to B-HT 920, M-7, UK-14,304 (full alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists) and indanidine (Sgd 101/75: partial alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist). For an 80 mm Hg increase in blood pressure, full alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists enhanced total peripheral, renal and mesenteric vascular resistances significantly more than alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulants or indanidine. In contrast, all compounds produced a similar degree of hindquarter vasoconstriction, suggesting that both types of alpha adrenoceptors have the same functional importance in this skeletal muscle vascular bed. Application of a multivariate discriminant analysis to the drug-induced changes in the total peripheral and mesenteric vascular resistances associated with a pressor effect of 80 mm Hg allowed their assignment to two distinct groups corresponding to the full alpha-1 and the full alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists plus indanidine. All investigated compounds in low doses increased cardiac output, which returned to base-line values after high doses of alpha-1 but plateaued after high doses of alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists or indanidine. alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists decreased whereas alpha-2 stimulants and indanidine successively increased and then decreased renal blood flow. Finally, all investigated compounds increased hindquarter blood flow at low doses but decreased it at high doses. The ratios of the doses of cirazoline required to produce a 100% rise in systemic and local vascular resistances in the presence or in the absence of prazosin were of similar magnitude. This was also true for M-7 when studied in the presence or in the absence of yohimbine. These findings suggest pharmacological identity within alpha-1 as well as within alpha-2 adrenoceptor populations in all investigated vascular beds. Finally, the calcium entry blocker diltiazem did not affect the increases in systemic and regional resistances evoked by cirazoline but depressed profoundly the effects of M-7 and indanidine. In conclusion, full alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists can be discriminated easily on the basis of their systemic and regional hemodynamics in the pithed rat. That the hemodynamic effects of the partial alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist indanidine are similar to those of alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists and susceptible to calcium channel blockade suggests that the alpha-1 adrenoceptors stimulated by this drug have the same coupling modality as alpha-2 adrenoceptors and share with the latter the same functional expression when stimulated.\r"

  ".W": "The authors examined the effects of hypoxia (8% O2 in N2) on the turnover rates of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) in the heart, adrenal gland, submaxillary gland and stomach. The turnover rates were estimated by measuring the decrease in the content of NE and E after an i.p. injection of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (250 mg/kg), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase. After a 4-h exposure to hypoxia, the turnover rate of NE in the heart and those of NE and E in the adrenal gland were increased, whereas that of NE in the submaxillary gland was decreased. The turnover rate of NE in the stomach was unchanged. Pretreatment with hexamethonium, a ganglionic nicotinic receptor blocker, abolished the hypoxia-induced changes in the turnover rate of NE or E in the heart, adrenal gland and submaxillary gland. Furthermore, transection of the spinal cord at the level of C5-6 abolished hypoxia-induced alterations in the turnover rate of NE and E in the adrenal gland and submaxillary gland. In contrast, the hypoxia-induced changes seen in the heart persisted, although at a lower level, even after transection. These results show that the effects of hypoxia on the activities of the sympathoadrenal system differ depending on the organs; activities are increased in the heart and adrenal gland, decreased in the submaxillary gland and unchanged in the stomach. Furthermore, the present data suggest that hypoxia-induced alterations in the activities of cardiac sympathetic nerves originate in both the brain and spinal cord, including preganglionic neurons, whereas changes in the activities of the sympathetic nerves to the adrenal gland and submaxillary gland originate mainly in the brain.\r"

The elimination rate of E-0663 from the brain was longer than that of the classical compounds, chlorpromazine, perphenazine and triflupromazine. The phenothiazine (0.01-100 mumol/kg i.v.) increased the metabolites of catecholamines. Direct correlation analysis was applied to the intracerebral concentrations of the drugs and monoamine-related substances. Significant correlations were observed between the concentrations of drugs and dopamine metabolites (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid). The relative potency of the drugs for the effect on the extraneuronal process was promethazine less than chlorpromazine less than E-0663 less than triflupromazine less than perphenazine by covariance analysis. On the other hand, noradrenaline metabolite (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol) also revealed a significant correlation, and the potency was highest in the case of E-0663. These results suggest that E-0663 possessed different pharmacokinetic profiles and a different spectrum in its action on monoamine metabolism from classical phenothiazines. The method described here is simple for comparing the real potency and is useful as a new approach in the biochemical pharmacology of centrally acting drugs.\r"

Intravenous infusion of dopamine significantly reduced both gastric acid secretion and MBF. The inhibitory effect of dopamine on the vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion was not attenuated by sulpiride, metoclopramide or domperidone. Haloperidol abolished the inhibitory effect of dopamine on the acid secretion; it also abolished the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on the vagally stimulated acid secretion. The inhibitory effect of dopamine on the acid secretion was abolished by phentolamine and yohimbine but not by propranolol or prazosin. Dopamine-induced reduction in the vagally stimulated gastric MBF was abolished by haloperidol and was partially antagonized by sulpiride or metoclopramide. In addition, the dopamine-induced reduction in the MBF was abolished by phentolamine and prazosin and was partially antagonized by yohimbine. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of dopamine on the vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion is mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptor mechanisms and that the inhibitory effect of dopamine on the MBF is, at least in part, mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptor mechanisms. The authors did not obtain evidence for the existence of dopamine receptor-mediated mechanisms.\r"

In this study we determined the effect of a desensitizing regimen of SP (15 micrograms X 2 at a 30-min interval) on analgesia produced by intrathecal NA in the rat tail-flick test. When NA was injected immediately after the regimen or after a 90-minute delay, NA analgesia was blocked. This blockade persisted up to 11 days after exposure to SP. Exposure to a single dose of SP (15 or 30 micrograms) also blocked NA acutely, but the long-term blockade did not last as long. An identical effect was observed with ST-91. SP (15 micrograms X 2) potentiated the analgesic action of morphine acutely, but no interaction was observed 4 to 7 days later. Pretreatment with morphine and naloxone prevented the long-term blockade by SP. The effect of naloxone was not reversed by naltrexone suggesting that occupation of opiate receptors rather than an apparent agonist effect of naloxone caused the protection. Pretreatment with clonidine had only a slight effect on long-term blockade, but yohimbine was without effect. The present study describes a new long-term interaction between SP and alpha-2 agonists in the spinal cord. The mechanism(s) of the observed blockade by SP remains to be elucidated. However, there appears to be a functionally significant interaction between opiate and alpha-2 receptors in the spinal cord.\r"

Flunarizine dose dependently inhibited the Ca++ inward current (ID50 = 1.4 microM). The decay of the inward current consisted of two exponentials and flunarizine had no effect on these time constants. When command pulses (100 msec; stepped up to 0 mV from -60 mV) were applied every 20 sec, the peak amplitude of the inward current remained unchanged. Flunarizine above 0.3 microM slowly inhibited the peak amplitude of inward current, in a voltage- and use-dependent manner. Intracellular perfusion of flunarizine, up to 100 microM, did not modify the peak amplitude of the inward current. This Ca++ antagonist also inhibited the K+ outward current, in a dose-dependent manner (ID50 = 5.8 microM) and accelerated inactivations of this current. When the command pulses (300 msec; stepped up to +20 mV from -60 mV) were applied repetitively every 20 sec, amplitudes of the K+ outward current were not affected. However, flunarizine, above 1 microM, reduced the peak amplitude of the K+ outward current slowly. These results indicate that although flunarizine possesses the property of a Ca++ antagonist, it also inhibits the K+ outward current, in a manner different from that observed on the Ca++ inward current.\r"

Fentanyl, d-propoxyphene, profadol, bromadoline, buprenorphine and nalbuphine produced only a decrease in urine output, which was antagonised by pretreatment with beta-FNA, 40 mg/kg s.c., 24 hr beforehand. These drugs were thus characterized as selective mu receptor agonists. U-50,488, tifluadom, Mr2034, proxorphan, ethylketocyclazocine and butorphanol all produced an initial decrease in urine output, which was antagonized by beta-FNA, and therefore probably mu receptor mediated, followed by a beta-FNA insensitive diuretic effect, which was probably kappa receptor mediated. For U-50,488, tifluadom, Mr2034 and proxorphan the threshold dose for increasing urine output was lower than that for decreasing it, suggesting that these four compounds are kappa-selective agonists. For ethylketocyclazocine and butorphanol, the threshold doses for producing both effects were similar, suggesting that these two drugs are non-selective agonists. SKF 10,047 produced a diuretic effect at low dose-levels, which may be kappa receptor mediated, and a beta-FNA insensitive decrease in urine output at higher dose-levels, which may suggest a sigma receptor mediated effect.\r"

The influence of neuronal uptake and of activation of beta adrenoceptors was also investigated. EPI was more potent in distal than in proximal segments. The antagonistic effect of idazoxan (100 nM) against EPI was greater in distal than in proximal segments, whereas the opposite result was obtained with prazosin (0.1-10 nM). No such difference were observed when NOR was used as agonist. Reducing the calcium ion concentration had a greater inhibitory effect on EPI in distal than in proximal segments. Cocaine (4 microM) increased responses to EPI and NOR to a greater extent in proximal than in distal segments. In the presence of cocaine, in proximal segments, antagonism of EPI by prazosin was reduced, whereas in distal segments, antagonism by idazoxan and the inhibitory effect of a reduction in calcium ion concentration were reduced. Propranolol (1 microM) increased responses to EPI and NOR to a greater extent in proximal than in distal segments. In the presence of propranolol, antagonism of EPI by both prazosin and idazoxan was reduced in proximal segments, and the inhibitory effect of a reduction in calcium ion concentration was lost. Forskolin (1 microM) inhibited responses to EPI and prevented the antagonistic effect of idazoxan, but not that of prazosin. From the results obtained it is suggested that smooth muscle alpha-2 adrenoceptors are distributed differently in the proximal and distal ends of the rat tail artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intracisternally administered GABA or homotaurine inhibited, in a bicuculline-sensitive manner, the supraspinal micturition reflex. Bicuculline or picrotoxin increased the amplitude and duration of the micturition contractions of supraspinal origin, suggesting the existence of a tonic GABAergic inhibitory mechanism. Neither diazepam nor bicuculline or picrotoxin had any significant effect on threshold of the spinal vesico-vesical micturition reflex. Aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of GABA catabolism, increased threshold of the spinal but not of the supraspinal vesico-vesical reflex in a bicuculline-sensitive manner. Volume threshold for eliciting the supraspinal reflex was increased by diazepam and decreased by picrotoxin. Neither picrotoxin nor aminooxyacetic acid modified amplitude of bladder contractions elicited by pinching of the perineal skin (spinal somato-vesical reflex) nor of that produced by preganglionic nerve stimulation of the excitatory nerves. It is concluded that endogenous GABAergic mechanisms involving the activation of GABA A receptors modulate both the spinal and the supraspinal vesico-vesical micturition reflexes. These endogenous GABAergic mechanism(s) are operating tonically in inhibiting micturition at supraspinal but not spinal level.\r"

Consequently, conservative management is frequently elected. These pregnancies, however, are still at risk. Antepartum fetal heart rate testing has been of demonstrable value in other high-risk pregnancies and should offer a method of assessing risk in SPROM. Therefore, a retrospective analysis of patients with SPROM who underwent antepartum fetal heart rate testing was undertaken to evaluate its clinical utility in identifying the fetus at risk. Forty-eight patients underwent 154 nonstress tests in the study population. Indications for delivery included fetal pulmonary maturity, amnionitis and persistent variable decelerations with the failure of amniotic fluid to reaccumulate. Variable decelerations were present in 32% of all tests. Fetal heart rate abnormalities severe enough to warrant delivery were noted in 10 of 48 patients (21%). No intrauterine deaths occurred. Our data suggest that once conservative management is elected in preterm patients with SPROM, the nonstress test may identify fetuses at risk of repeated umbilical cord compression and may allow continuous monitoring or delivery.\r"

Most studies conducted in the past did not systematically ascertain the incidence of nonmenstrual TSS but relied on voluntarily reported cases, which may be biased. Moreover, some factors that influence the recognition of TSS in menstruating and nonmenstruating women may distort the risk factor status of recognized cases. For these reasons, reliable information on nonmenstrual TSS is largely unavailable.\r"

Early evaluation (four days) established that the material remained where initially placed. Examination at two, four and eight weeks postoperatively in both control and treated groups revealed that the extent of adhesion formation did not change as a function of time. When compared to control animals without TC-7, the treated rabbits has a significant reduction (P less than .01) in postoperative adhesion formation. No complications from use of this fabric were noted, and no gross remnants were noted at the two-week time point. TC-7 appears to be an efficacious barrier for reducing adhesion formation in the rabbit uterine horn model.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating maternal prolactin (PRL) levels have been reported to be higher in term pregnancies yielding male infants. The mechanism for this gender difference is unknown, but we theorized that it was mediated through the fetal adrenal cortex. To test this theory we measured circulating PRL and estriol (E3) concentrations with radioimmunoassay in 37 pregnant women at 34 and 36 weeks' gestation. We then separated the groups by newborn gender. Maternal serum PRL levels were significantly higher in the women bearing male fetuses. There was no significant difference by gender in E3 concentrations, and there was no PRL surge corresponding to the E3 surge at 34-36 weeks' gestational age. There was no correlation between E3 and PRL levels. Transmission of the fetal gender effect on maternal PRL does not appear to be mediated through the fetal adrenal as measured by the fetoplacental production of E3. The effect probably is mediated by the fetal gonad.\r"

In 104 Dutch belted rabbits the impact of microsurgical resection anastomoses on ovum transport during the first 24 hours after ovulation was examined. In oviducts in which the ampulla had been operated on, ovum transport was delayed. Mucosal irregularities that interfere with normal ampullary transport by cilia activity may account for the delay noted. Alterations in the duration of ovum transport in the oviduct may influence pregnancy outcome by creating an inappropriate tubal environment for the early embryo or by creating asynchrony between the embryo and the endometrium. No changes were observed in transport in oviducts in which the isthmus had been operated on: even a small segment of isthmus seems to act as a physiologic sphincter and to prevent premature ovum entrance into the uterus.\r"

  ".W": "An analysis of 25 perinatal malpractice cases filed in Wisconsin between 1978 and 1984 clearly revealed that the unfavorable outcomes were preventable and caused by professional negligence. Each case was settled or adjudicated in favor of the plaintiff, and the awards totaled $25.1 million. Although cases with a total recovery of over $1 million are relatively infrequent, they are not so rare as to be considered extra-ordinary occurrences. Fifty-six percent of physicians involved failed to recognize a high-risk pregnancy or fetal distress, while 44% failed to render proper care. The most common errors involved inadequate fetal monitoring, the injudicious use of oxytocin and the failure to recognize a high-risk pregnancy, such as prematurity or postterm or multiple gestation. The purpose of this study was to examine the medicolegal issues operating in such cases in order to develop guidelines for reducing professional negligence, thereby preventing injury to women and their newborns.\r"

Two hundred thirty (92%) had endometrial curettage at the time of cervical conization. Abnormal findings were present in 7 (3%) of the 230 curettings. Limiting the performance of endometrial curettage at the time of conization to patients meeting specific criteria would have reduced the number of combined procedures by 75% without jeopardizing our ability to detect significant pathology. Endocervical curettage was performed on 221 (88%) of the 250 patients undergoing conization. The endocervical curettings were not a good predictor of the involvement of the cone margins with neoplasia. Only 7 (20%) of 35 patients with involved endocervical margins had a positive endocervical curettage. While the cone margins predicted residual carcinoma in the hysterectomy specimen with a sensitivity of 1.0, the sensitivity of the endocervical curettings for predicting residual carcinoma was 0.5. Although endocervical curettings can detect an invasive cancer not detected in the cone specimen, a negative endocervical curettage does not rule out invasive cancer above the excision line.\r"

Increased frequencies of Bw50 and Cw6 were observed in patients with systemic onset. Typing for properdin factor (Bf) and glyoxylase (GLO) was carried out in 45 and 50 of the patients, respectively. No associations with alleles of the complement Bf system or the HLA linked GLO system were evident.

We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mEq/l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration. In all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac. As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause-and-effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia. These observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified.\r"

We studied this relationship further in an attempt to better understand pathogenetic mechanisms of vasculitis. We examined the records of 129 cases of hairy cell leukemia seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1976 and 1983, and identified 2 cases with evidence of systemic vasculitis. The first of these cases is discussed in detail. Immunologic studies were performed but we were unable to demonstrate the presence of shared antigen on hairy cells and endothelial cells. The literature is reviewed and reports of this association are summarized. Possible mechanisms of vascular injury are discussed.\r"

The data suggest that problem-based curricula provide a student-centered learning environment and encourage an inquisitive style of learning in their students as opposed to the rote memorization and short-term learning strategies induced by conventional medical education. In addition, community-oriented schools appear to influence the career preferences of their students. The few data available show that significantly larger proportions of graduates from these schools seek careers in primary care. Some of the studies reviewed suggest that students in conventional programs perform somewhat better on traditional measures of academic achievement than do students in problem-based curricula. However, these differences, if any, tend to be very small. Data with respect to performance on instruments measuring clinical competence are inconclusive. Finally, the authors discuss the difficulties involved in carrying out comparative research at the curriculum level.\r"

The purpose of the study reported here was to determine whether the information provided by this test, when used in conjunction with college grade-point averages (GPAs) and scores on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), would improve the prediction of medical school performance. Specifically, the authors investigated the incremental predictive value of the MRAT relative to students' overall performance in medical school and, more specifically, to their knowledge and clinical reasoning during preclinical years and clinical performance during the clerkship year. Overall, it was found that, with the exception of the first year, the addition of MRAT scores to the GPAs and MCAT scores increased precision in identifying students who performed poorly or exceptionally well in the second year and the clinical clerkship year. This last finding is especially useful, since few other tests have provided that information. On the basis of the preliminary findings, the authors propose further use and validation of the MRAT.\r"

The lower rim of the wheel was positioned 5 cm below the xyphoid. By varying wheel stiffness, wheel orientation, and column angle, resultant abdominal injury ranged from fatal or critical to minor or none. Wheel stiffness was found to be the primary determinant of abdominal injury severity. The mechanism of abdominal injury was identified to be the rim impacting the abdomen and exceeding a combined velocity and compression sensitive tolerance limit. Abdominal injury occurred within the initial 15 ms of wheel contact before whole body movement of the surrogate of column compression, which were initiated by hub contact with the thorax. The severity of abdominal injury correlated with the peak viscous response which can be represented by the product of the instantaneous velocity of abdominal deformation and abdominal compression. It did not correlate with spinal acceleration.\r"

Mechanical ventilation (CMV) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the mainstay of therapy. High peak inspiration (PIP) and mean airway (PAW) pressure in association with the delivery of large, conventional mechanical breaths are major determinants of complications. The efficacy of HFV was evaluated in this patient population (45 patients, mean age, 32.7 +/- 14.4 years; range, 11-75). CMV was provided with a time-cycled ventilator delivering 12-15 cc/kg tidal volume and a mechanical rate adjusted to provide a PaCO2 38-42 torr for patients previously eucapneic. CPAP was titrated to achieve a preselected endpoint of an intrapulmonary shunt of less than equal to 15%. FIO2 was maintained at or below 0.45 whenever possible. The Trauma Index Score for the group was 8.8 +/- 2.4. CMV yielded a mechanical rate of 6.3 +/- 3.2 and a CPAP of 13.9 +/- 8.5 cm H2O. High-frequency ventilation was provided by either a solenoid-based jet ventilator (HFJV) or a pneumatic cartridge high-frequency pulse generator (HFPG). Measured and calculated hemodynamic and pulmonary variables were obtained prior to and 20 minutes after transition to HFV. Thirty-three patients received HFJV; 12 patients received HFPG. Data were evaluated with a paired t-test. All patients on HFJV demonstrated improved CO2 elimination with the same hemodynamic profiles. Those on HFPG demonstrated comparable gas exchange and hemodynamic profiles with lower CPAP/PIP. Where measured, PAW was significantly lower with HFPG when compared with CMV.\r"

  ".W": "The 'optimal' hematocrit to which patients should be resuscitated after shock and trauma is controversial. To test the hypothesis that sufficient oxygen delivery can be provided at a lower hematocrit without impairing oxygen consumption or hemodynamic function, 25 patients were prospectively studied immediately following injury and/or acute hemorrhage. Patients were randomized to have their hematocrits (HCT) maintained near 30% (29.7 +/- 0.4% (M +/- SEM); n = 12) or 40% (38.4 +/- 0.6%, n = 13). Cardiopulmonary parameters were measured twice a day for 3 days. Statistical analysis used a repeated measures analysis of variance with patient age, and ventilator parameters (FIO2, PEEP, and ventilator mode) as covariates. Arterial and venous O2 saturations were not significantly different at different hematocrits, although arterial and venous O2 contents were lower at 30% HCT (a = 14.1 +/- 0.2 m10(2)/dl, v = 10.1 +/- 0.3 m10(2)/dl; vs. a = 17.4 +/- 0.4 m10(2)/dl, v = 13.6 +/- 0.6 m10(2)/dl; p less than 0.05). This resulted in a lower oxygen delivery at the lower HCT. Between the two groups, there also was no significant difference in cardiac index (overall mean, 3.64 +/- 0.16 ml/min/m2), heart rate (99 +/- 4 bpm), systemic vascular resistance (1,058 +/- 55 dyne-sec/cm5), or left ventricular stroke work index (4.3 +/- 0.3 X 10(6) dyne-cm/m2). Intrapulmonary shunt was higher with higher hematocrit (22.6 +/- 2.4% at 40% HCT vs. 14.6 +/- 1.6% at 30% HCT; p less than 0.05) with no difference in end-expiratory pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients at high risk for developing infectious complications may be identified on the basis of operative findings and the duration of the postinjury antibiotic regimen determined. Colonic injury is the most important determinant of infectious complications. Number of other organs injured, age, and mode of injury have little or no additional impact on infection rates. Low-risk patients can be successfully managed with three perioperative doses of antibiotics. Nontrauma related nosocomial infections appear to be associated with trauma related infections in high-risk patients. Intravenous clindamycin plus tobramycin and metronidazole plus tobramycin for 72 hours postinjury are equally effective in reducing postinjury infections in \"high-risk\" patients.\r"

The site of injury was the penile urethra in three cases, the bulbous urethra in seven, and the prostatomembranous urethra in 28. Different surgical procedures were used, according to the site and the extent of urethral damage and the presence of associated lesions. All patients with penile and bulbous urethral trauma were cured and only one has diminished sexual potency, while in the posterior urethral group nine were cured, and 19 developed strictures requiring further surgical treatment. Total impotence developed in 17 and partial impotence in one patient. Another case presents urinary urge incontinence.\r"

Impacts with a velocity of 10 m/sec and a contact compression of 5 cm were delivered to most of the pericardium. Transient arrhythmias in impacted animals resulted in significant reductions in all hemodynamic responses at 15 minutes post-impact. Intragastric doses of 50% ethanol/distilled water yielded average blood alcohol concentrations of 60 +/- 10 mg%, 120 +/- 20 mg%, and 180 +/- 15 mg%. Alcohol effected significant reductions in dp/dt and cardiac index and elevations in total peripheral resistance during treatment. Alcohol and trauma resulted in per cent mortalities of 17, 50, and 71% for each such group primarily from electrical-mechanical dissociation. Surviving animals experienced significant declines in dp/dt, cardiac index, and mean aortic pressure at 15 minutes post-impact. Mean aortic pressure remained depressed while dp/dt, cardiac index, and total peripheral resistance returned to control values.\r"

The injury is similar to a second-degree burn. The wounds were dressed with one of four dressings: Duoderm (Squibb), Op-Site (Smith & Nephew) [corrected], and collagen sponge, covered with either occlusive or semiocclusive polyurethane film (Datascope Corp.). The last two dressings were moistened with saline before application. The rate of epithelization by planimetric quantitation after 3 to 5 days was the same regardless of the dressing used, although the epithelium layer was thicker in wounds treated with Duoderm. Wounds dressed by either of the collagen sponge materials showed a better appearance when visually scored. Wounds dressed with Duoderm or Op-Site were often macerated; Duoderm's paste-like material remained on the wound and was difficult to remove without inflicting discomfort to the patient. Duoderm, and also Op-Site, adhered much more strongly to the intact skin than either type of collagen sponge dressing.\r"

Burns of second to third degree, covering 0.8% of total body surface, were produced by short application of a hot piece of metal to the skin under ether anesthesia. Levels of mRNA in extracts from liver removed after 24 hr were measured by hybridization to radioactively labeled specific cDNA probes. The level of mRNA for major acute phase alpha 1-protein (also called cysteine proteinase inhibitor or T1-kininogen) increased 20-fold, that of fibrinogen mRNA 8-fold, and that of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mRNA about 9-fold. The levels of albumin mRNA and transthyretin mRNA (also called prealbumin) decreased to about 80% of normal and the level of transferrin mRNA did not change significantly. Thus, although the percentage of burnt skin was only very small, a typical acute phase response of plasma protein synthesis in liver was observed.\r"

The posterior fixation was aided by accurate definition of the injury pattern, use of preoperative traction, early surgical treatment, use of flexible instruments, and identification of the posterior sacral foramina, which were used as a guide to allow accurate screw placement into the sacrum and avoid nerve root injury. The procedure was not associated with an increased rate of infection or neural injury. In the ten patients followed more than 1 year there were no late displacements of the hemipelvis and all of the fractures healed.\r"

The hemothorax blood showed: very prolonged PT and PTT; very low platelets and fibrinogen; midly elevated FDP; very low coagulation factors VIII, and V; reduced XII, prothrombin, X, XI, and VII. Partial clotting, mild fibrinolysis, and fibrin deposition over the pulmonary pleura seemed to cause incoagulability of hemothorax blood. Post autotransfusion arterial blood showed: normal PT and PTT; 25% decrease in platelets, and 31% decrease in fibrinogen from baseline values. There was also an overall 20% reduction of fibrinogen from baseline values. There was also an overall 20% reduction of all clotting factors, but their levels remained above 50% activity. It was concluded that autotransfusion from a hemothorax of 25% the blood volume in dogs causes a mild loss of hemostatic components, but does not significantly compromise the clotting mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The topical agents used in burn care today, although beneficial, do have limitations, the most important of which is the failure to prevent or treat burn wound infections in patients with extensive injuries. Therefore, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two silver nylon fabrics (SN and HRS) on the growth of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans. The theoretical advantages of these nylon fabrics over presently available silver compounds is their ability to continuously release silver ions into the burn wound as long as the material is in contact with the wound. Additionally, the release of silver from these fabrics can be augmented electrolytically. The results of these experiments indicated that both materials were microbicidal in vitro for all three test organisms. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity could be significantly augmented by passing a weak DC current through the material, which increased the rate of release of silver ions from the fabrics. In vivo, HRS was as effective as silver sulfadiazine in preventing colonization of the burn wound. The use of silver nylon fabrics thus appears to be a promising way of delivering large quantities of silver ions into the burn wound without the potential side effects of a carrier molecule or cream.\r"

The findings were similar in both groups of injured patients and in keeping with the hormonal and substrate responses to the stress of trauma; plasma FFA levels were raised but in neither group was the rise pronounced. Plasma FFA levels of the fracture patients were only moderately higher than the values of the healthy fasting subjects. These findings suggest that mobilized FFA from peripheral adipose tissue are not important in the genesis of the FES, but do not exclude a role for FFA derived mainly from hydrolysis of triglyceride emboli in the lung.\r"

  ".W": "The model AS 800 artificial urinary sphincter was implanted in 100 male and 9 female patients between 7 and 89 years old. Postoperative followup was 1 to 32 months. The indication for implantation was total urinary incontinence in 86 patients (78.9 per cent), stress incontinence in 22 (21.2 per cent) and urgency incontinence in 1 (0.9 per cent). Of the patients 97 (89 per cent) underwent implantation for the first time, 7 (6.4 per cent) had a previous artificial urinary sphincter model replaced by the AS 800 device and 5 (4.6 per cent) underwent reimplantation of a previous model. The cuff was placed around the bladder neck in all 9 female patients, whereas in the male patients the cuff was implanted around the bladder neck in 20 and around the bulbous urethra in 80. Thirty-one patients (28.4 per cent), 29 of whom were continent at night, were practicing nocturnal deactivation of the device. Complete post-activation continence was achieved in 91 patients (83.5 per cent), some leakage occurred in 10 (9.2 per cent) and 8 (7.3 per cent) remained incontinent. A total of 23 patients required 1 or more revisions, the most common indications for the first revision being loss of cuff compression (9), tubing kink (3), cuff erosion (3) and infection (2). At the time of this report 89 patients (81.7 per cent) were continent, 9 (8.3 per cent) still had some leakage, 3 (2.8 per cent) were incontinent, 5 (4.6 per cent) were awaiting reimplantation and 3 (2.8 per cent) had died of unrelated causes.\r"

  ".W": "Peyronie's disease is a localized and progressive fibrosis of unknown etiology that affects the tunica albuginea of the penis. We examined cytogenetically cell cultures derived from plaque, adjacent tunica, dermis and lymphocytes in patients with Peyronie's disease, and compared the results to cell cultures established from the tunica albuginea of control patients. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 9 plaque-derived cell cultures from 7 of 12 Peyronie's disease patients (58 per cent). Cells cultured from adjacent tunica, dermis and lymphocytes from the same patients were karyotypically normal, as were cultures derived from control (chordee and penile scar) patients. Chromosomal aberrations consisted of 5 numerical changes and 4 structural rearrangements, and included chromosomal additions (trisomy 7 and trisomy 8), deletions (45X,-Y), reciprocal translocations and inversions or markers. In 2 instances cultures derived from plaque tissue contained 2 independent chromosomal abnormalities. The apparently random chromosomal changes associated with Peyronie's disease suggests that karyotypic instability may be a common feature of cells within the plaque. It presently is unclear whether this finding represents multiple pathways for the development of Peyronie's disease or secondary consequences of Peyronie's disease.\r"

No infections or erosion complications were encountered. We conclude that the penile prosthesis should be included in the armamentarium for the treatment of impotence in the immunosuppressed man.\r"

The significance of vascular invasion was analyzed in respect to the appearance of visceral metastases and the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy. Vascular invasion was demonstrated in 27 per cent of the patients with seminomas and 53 per cent with nonseminomatous germ cell testis tumors, while visceral metastases appeared in 9 and 32 per cent, respectively. Without adjuvant chemotherapy all 13 patients with nonseminomatous germ cell testis tumors and vascular invasion had metastases, compared to only 3 of 13 without vascular invasion (p less than 0.0005). Of 9 patients with seminoma and vascular invasion 3 had tumor progression, compared to 1 of 24 without vascular invasion (p greater than 0.05). With adjuvant chemotherapy only 1 of 15 patients (7 per cent) with nonseminomatous germ cell testis tumors and vascular invasion had metastases, compared to 100 per cent of 13 without this treatment. No significant correlation was noted between pT stage versus vascular invasion and pT stage versus tumor progression. The results demonstrate the importance of vascular invasion in the staging of and choice of treatment for early nonseminomatous germ cell testis tumors.\r"

The levels of prostate specific antigen were elevated in 10 per cent of the patients with stage A, 24 per cent with stage B, 53 per cent with stage C and 92 per cent with stage D disease. However, prostate specific antigen levels also were elevated in 9 per cent of the patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy. This lack of specificity in the presence of benign prostatic hypertrophy probably precludes prostate specific antigen from being recommended as a screening test for prostatic cancer. The ultimate role of prostate specific antigen might be as the marker of choice to monitor therapy for prostatic carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 12 patients with absorptive hypercalciuria type II and 11 normal controls participated in a study to evaluate the effects of dietary protein levels on urinary calcium and oxalate excretion before and after a 1 gm. dose of oxalate. Two test periods were used during which calcium (less than 400 mg. per day) and oxalate were restricted. The first test was done under conditions of low dietary protein (12 per cent total caloric intake, 60 gm.) and the second test was done at a high protein level (25 per cent, 125 gm. protein). Twelve-hour urine specimens were obtained after dinner on day 3 of each diet (low and high protein) and again on day 4 when 1 gm. oxalate (spinach) was added to the dinner meal. The specimens were analyzed for calcium, oxalate and relative calcium oxalate saturation (concentration product ratio). There were no significant differences between the controls and subjects with absorptive hypercalciuria type II in oxalate excretion before the oxalate load on the low protein (controls 31.4 +/- 4.2 standard error, expressed as mmol. oxalate per mol. creatinine, and absorptive hypercalciuria type II 23.1 +/- 3.1) and high protein (controls 30.4 +/- 4.2 and absorptive hypercalciuria type II 28.8 +/- 5.9) diets. After the oxalate bolus the positive changes in oxalate excretion were 11.8 +/- 4.8 (low protein) and 17.8 +/- 4.7 (high protein) for controls, and 11.4 +/- 4.4 (low protein) and 31.8 +/- 5.2 (high protein) for patients with absorptive hypercalciuria type II. Thus, the increases in post-load urinary oxalate levels observed for controls and patients were greater on the high protein than on the low protein diets. After the oxalate load the increases in urinary oxalate and calcium oxalate supersaturation were significantly greater for patients with absorptive hypercalciuria type II than for control subjects for the high protein but not the low protein diets (p less than 0.05).\r"

The mean smallest and largest daily voided volumes, and the daily mean of all voided volumes were determined from the diary. Comparison of the cystometric bladder capacity with the daily voided volumes showed a significant positive correlation between cystometric bladder capacity and the largest voided volume (r equals 0.4938, p less than 0.01). Comparison of the mean daily and mean largest daily void, and the cystometric capacity with the different urodynamic diagnoses using analysis of variance revealed a statistical significance among the groups (p less than 0.01). We established the validity of cystometric bladder capacity in the measurement of functional bladder volume and that a home diary may be useful in clinical practice.\r"
