  ".W": "Minimal resection with curative intent for bronchogenic carcinoma was performed at our institutions in 15 patients from 1977 to 1987. All patients were stage I (T1N0 or T2N0). The five-year actuarial survival was 77 percent. The median length of follow-up for patients remaining alive was 41 months. There was a 6 percent (n = 1) local recurrence rate and a 27 percent (n = 3) distant recurrence rate. Both survival and recurrence rates are similar for minimal resection and for that being reported for lobectomy and pneumonectomy for stage I bronchogenic carcinoma. In our series, both median length of operating time and median length of postoperative hospital stay was less for those patients undergoing minimal resection for stage I bronchogenic carcinoma than for those undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy. Minimal resection can be considered as an acceptable treatment for bronchogenic carcinoma when technically possible in selected patients.\r"

We compared echocardiographic results to computed tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance, surgery or autopsy data in 49 patients: the concordance was 86 percent. Significant ST-T changes were present in 77.7 percent of the patients with myocardial infiltration at echocardiography. The \"false negatives\" (normal ECG, nonspecific changes) were mainly related to infiltration limited to the right side of the heart; in some of these cases, the appearance of right bundle branch block was observed. The \"false positives\" (ST-T changes without echocardiographic signs of infiltration) were observed in the older patients and in those with pericardial effusion or other heart diseases. The ST segment elevation was a more specific sign of myocardial infiltration as compared to negative T waves (86 vs 47 percent). A progression or the disappearance of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities was observed during follow-up in 24 cases. Serial electrocardiograms are useful for screening in clinical settings in neoplastic patients; the appearance of ST-T changes or of conduction disturbances should suggest the need for two-dimensional echocardiography in order to define the diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Although thrombolytic agents have been available for over 10 years and have demonstrated safety and efficacy in an increasing number of clinical conditions involving thrombotic phenomena, their general acceptance as first-line therapeutic agents in medical management has been slow. Much of the reluctance to use these drugs is based on their associated incidence of hemorrhagic complications, which is several-fold greater than with use of conventional anticoagulants. With the introduction of second-generation thrombolytic agents, made possible through successes in recombinant DNA technology and chemical modifications of previously available compounds, increased fibrin specificity has been achieved and has been translated into increased clinical efficacy and safety. These results will likely improve as innovative regimens using dose modifications or multiple agents with combined synergy are developed. An appreciation of basic coagulation and the pharmacology of anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents is necessary to maximize the benefits of currently available medications, to develop new treatment strategies, and to minimize potential hemorrhagic complications.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of severe hypoglycemia was determined in a 1-yr prospective study of 350 insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) children. There were no significant differences in mean glycosylated hemoglobin, age, and duration of disease between the patients who had severe hypoglycemia and those who did not. There were 25 episodes in 24 patients (6.8%). Their insulin doses at the time of the episode (U.kg-1.day-1) were significantly higher than those of the nonhypoglycemic group (mean +/- SD 1.01 +/- 0.30 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.29; P = .04). The hypoglycemic group had a significantly higher mean number of previous episodes of severe hypoglycemia than the nonhypoglycemic group (0.92 +/- 1.18 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.68; P = .01). In only 64% of the episodes, an unusual circumstance such as strenuous physical activity or missed or delayed meals preceded the event. Multivariate analysis of the data by logistic regression showed risks of developing hypoglycemia of 2.5 per 0.5 U/day insulin and of 2.0 per previous episode of severe hypoglycemia. We conclude that severe hypoglycemia may be a recurrent problem in some diabetic children, but it does not appear to be related to age or blood glucose control. The presence of previous episodes may be a guide to identify patients at greater risk of developing severe hypoglycemia. Adherence to regular testing, strict spacing and consistency of meals, and extra food for extra activity may reduce this serious complication.\r"

  ".W": "An estimated 58 million Americans are at increased risk of morbidity and premature death due to high blood pressure (BP) and require some type of therapy or systematic monitoring. This article focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of hypertension, new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of secondary hypertension, and current views of the most appropriate nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy for essential hypertension. In view of the extremely high prevalence of the disorder, emphasis is placed on efficient and cost-effective strategies for diagnosing and managing the hypertensive patient. Recent evidence indicates that nonpharmacologic therapy, including dietary potassium and calcium supplements, reduction of salt intake, weight loss for the obese patient, regular exercise, a diet high in fiber and low in cholesterol and saturated fats, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol consumption produces significant sustained reductions in BP while reducing overall cardiovascular risk. Accordingly, nonpharmacologic antihypertensive therapy should be included in the treatment of all hypertensive patients. In persons with mild hypertension, nonpharmacologic approaches may adequately reduce BP, thereby avoiding the expense and potential side effects of drug therapy. In patients with more severe hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, used in conjunction with pharmacologic therapy, can reduce the dosage of antihypertensive medications necessary for BP control. Patients treated with nonpharmacologic therapy only should be followed closely, and if BP control is not satisfactory, drug therapy should be added. The large number of drugs available for use in hypertension treatment, coupled with our rapidly expanding knowledge of the pathophysiology of hypertension and of the adverse effects of these drugs in individual patient groups, make it possible to individualize antihypertensive treatment. When used as monotherapy, most agents effectively lower BP in the majority of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. Thus, a single agent from one of four classes: diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta-adrenergic blockers, usually provides effective BP control with minimal side effects in most patients. Therapy should be initiated with the agent most likely to be effective in BP lowering and best tolerated. If the initial agent is ineffective at maximal recommended therapeutic doses or has undue side effects, an alternative agent from another class should be tried. When monotherapy is unsuccessful, a second agent, usually of a different mechanism of action, should be\r"

  ".U": "89210475\r", 
  ".W": "We have studied the ability of dexamethasone to regulate the glucose transport system in primary cultured adipocytes and delineated the mechanisms of insulin resistance after both acute and chronic treatment. Acutely, 20 nM dexamethasone led to a 65% decrease in basal and a 31% decrement in maximally insulin-stimulated glucose transport (ED50 = 3-4 nM; t1/2 = 50 min). These effects were maximal by 90-120 min, and a plateau was maintained over an additional 1-1.5 h. Chronic dexamethasone exposure (24 h) led to a more profound decrease in basal (77%; ED50 = 0.4 nM) and maximally stimulated (55%; ED50 = 1.0 nM) rates of glucose transport and shifted the transport: insulin dose-response curve to the right by increasing the half-maximally effective insulin concentration from 0.2 to 0.4 ng/ml. Dexamethasone did not affect cell surface insulin binding over 24 h. Both the short and long term effects of dexamethasone were partially blocked by the combined presence of insulin during preincubation and were not modulated by glucose. We also assessed effects on the number and cellular distribution of glucose transporter proteins using the cytochalasin-B binding assay. After 2 h, dexamethasone (30 nM) decreased the number of glucose transporters in plasma membranes by 30% in basal cells and by 41% in maximally insulin-stimulated cells, while increasing the number of low density microsomal transporters by 22-23% (P = NS). Transporter number in a total cellular membrane fraction was unaltered by short term dexamethasone. Chronic dexamethasone exposure (24 h) decreased plasma membrane and low density microsomal transporters by 30-50% in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells and depleted transporters by 43% in a total cellular membrane fraction. In conclusion, 1) dexamethasone induces progressive insulin resistance by sequentially regulating multiple aspects of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system. At early times (2 h) dexamethasone impairs insulin's ability to translocate intracellular glucose transporters to the cell surface and with more chronic exposure (24 h), depletes the total number of cellular transporters. 2) Glucose modulates desensitization of the glucose transport system by insulin, but not by dexamethasone, and thus, there are both glucose-dependent and -independent mechanisms of insulin resistance. 3) Insulin can heterologously inhibit dexamethasone's effects on glucose transport at both early and late phases of desensitization. These studies highlight the complex hormonal regulation at the glucose transport system.\r"

  ".W": "The roles of estrogen and extracellular calcium (Ca2+) in neuropeptide-Y (NPY)-stimulated LHRH release from median eminence (ME) fragments in vitro were examined. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats received one or several sc implants of Silastic tubes containing estradiol benzoate (235 micrograms/ml sesame oil) or vehicle. Plasma estrogen concentrations were similar to levels during the estrous cycle. These estrogen treatments were equally effective in reducing the elevated plasma levels of LH in vehicle-treated OVX rats. Animals were killed 3 days after implantation, and ME fragments were incubated in medium for 30 min (control), followed by a second 30-min period (test) in medium containing NPY or potassium chloride (K+). Estrogen treatment increased the basal release of LHRH and the ME concentration of LHRH in a dose-related fashion. NPY (0.1-10 microM) increased LHRH secretion in a dose-related manner from ME fragments obtained from estrogen-treated OVX rats, but had no effect on MEs from hormonally untreated OVX rats. Treatment with higher doses of estrogen enhanced the LHRH secretory response of ME fragments to NPY (1-10 microM). K+-stimulated LHRH release from ME fragments from estrogen-treated rats was completely eliminated in Ca2+-free medium containing EGTA. In contrast, LHRH release elicited by NPY (10 microM) was unchanged in Ca2+-free medium in both the absence and presence of cobalt chloride (Co2+). Decreasing the Ca2+ concentration from 2.5 to 0.25 mM reduced K+-stimulated LHRH release 7-fold, while NPY-stimulated LHRH secretion was not affected. These results indicate that NPY stimulation of LHRH release from the ME in vitro is related to prior circulating levels of estrogen, but does not require extracellular Ca2+ in the incubation medium. NPY may enhance LHRH release in an estrogen-dependent manner during the estrous cycle and before the LH surge on proestrous.\r"

Three putative sites of action were considered: the central nervous system, the pituitary, and the gonads. A central nervous system-mediated mechanism was tested by injecting Il-1 alpha into the lateral ventricle of the brain of castrated rats; this treatment caused a dose-related inhibition of LH secretion, with a minimum effective dose below 0.1 microgram (6.6 pmol) and a maximum effect at 1 microgram (66 pmol). The plateau response was observed 120 min after injection. The possibility that Il-1 alpha might alter pituitary sensitivity was studied by administering 200 ng GnRH, iv, into gonadectomized control rats or rats pretreated with 1 micrograms Il-1 alpha intracerebroventricularly. GnRH induced a comparable increase in the plasma LH levels of both groups of animals. Finally, hypophysectomized immature (24-day-old) female rats were used to determine if we could confirm in vivo that interleukin-1 alpha can act directly at the level of the ovary to interfere with steroidogenesis. In these animals, the sc injection of 20 IU PMSG produced a marked (P less than 0.01) increase in plasma estradiol levels, while the sequential injection of 20 IU PMSG and 1 microgram hCG significantly (P less than 0.01) stimulated progesterone release. The ip administration of 1 microgram Il-1 alpha every 12 h to gonadotropin-treated rats resulted in a significant inhibition of both estradiol and progesterone secretion. The results support possible roles for Il-1 alpha at the levels of the brain and the gonads, but not the pituitary, to inhibit reproductive functions.\r"

  ".U": "89210486\r", 
  ".W": "Recently, our laboratory has reported that central administration of beta-endorphin to rat pups decreases hepatic and renal ornithine decarboxylase activity, a sensitive biochemical index of tissue metabolic activity. Since these organs are the major sites of insulin catabolism, it seemed possible that the plasma levels of this hormone could be altered by changes in central nervous system (CNS) beta-endorphin levels. In the current study we tested this hypothesis by administering beta-endorphin to rat pups intracisternally (ic), followed by insulin sc, and then analyzing for plasma levels of insulin and glucose at various times after the second injection. We found that the apparent biological half-life of administered insulin markedly increased in 6-day-old rats pretreated with beta-endorphin ic. Similarly, this neuropeptide prolonged the half-life of endogenous insulin, as indicated by a small but significant increase in the plasma levels of this hormone in animals given only beta-endorphin. As expected, hypoglycemia in rats injected with beta-endorphin and insulin was more pronounced than in animals given insulin alone. Naloxone administered ic reversed both actions of beta-endorphin, indicating the involvement of opioid receptors in the response. beta-Endorphin also altered insulin and glucose plasma levels in 2-, 10-, and 18-day-old rats, but there were no effects in 30-day-old animals at any of the doses used in these studies. Peripheral administration of beta-endorphin had no effect, indicating that CNS beta-endorphin's influences on insulin and glucose metabolism occur through brain-based mechanisms. The results from these studies suggest that CNS beta-endorphin may be an important modulator of insulin and glucose metabolism in preweanling rats. In as much as insulin is a major regulator of somatic growth, our findings further suggest that CNS beta-endorphin may have a major role in the control of growth during early postnatal development by influencing insulin homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the hypothalamic content of beta-endorphin (beta EP) and other POMC-derived peptides increases 4 weeks after orchiectomy and that this increase can be prevented by testosterone replacement. To determine if these changes in hypothalamic beta EP content are secondary to changes in the biosynthesis of beta EP we have measured POMC mRNA levels in intact and castrated adult male rats with and without testosterone replacement. After either 2 or 4 weeks of treatment the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) was collected and homogenized. An aliquot was removed for beta EP RIA, RNA was isolated, and the amount of POMC mRNA was measured using a solution hybridization S1 nuclease protection assay. In agreement with previous results, the content of beta EP in the MBH from 4-week castrated animals (7930 +/- 568 pg/mg protein) was significantly increased compared to that in either castrated and testosterone-replaced rats (5792 +/- 568 pg/mg; P less than 0.02) or intact controls (6027 +/- 349 pg/mg; P less than 0.02). POMC mRNA in the MBH from the 4-week castrated group was significantly higher compared to that in the castrated and testosterone-replaced group (2.61 +/- 0.33 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.22 pg/microgram RNA; P less than 0.05), which is parallel to the changes we found in beta EP peptide levels. Two weeks after castration no significant change was detected in the beta EP content in the MBH from castrated rats (5401 +/- 318 pg/mg protein) compared to that in the castrated and testosterone-replaced group (4848 +/- 304 pg/mg protein). However, we were able to detect a significant difference in the amount of POMC mRNA in the 2-week castrated group (1.47 +/- 0.267 pg/microgram RNA) compared to that in the 2-week castrated and testosterone-replaced group (0.815 +/- 0.061 pg/microgram RNA; P less than 0.05). The finding that testosterone replacement for either 2 or 4 weeks to castrated rats significantly reduced POMC mRNA levels suggests that sex steroids have an inhibitory effect on the biosynthesis of POMC in the MBH.\r"

  ".W": "Binding and insulin-like effects of human GH (hGH) in inguinal adipocytes from young lean Fa/fa and obese fa/fa Zucker rats were studied. The binding of [125I]hGH per unit surface area is 2-fold higher in adipocytes prepared from 16- and 30-day-old fa/fa rats than in cells from lean littermates. A 3-h preincubation of the cells increases the hGH-binding capacity without changing the affinity of the binding, regardless of genotype. Freshly isolated adipocytes from 30-day-old lean rats fail to respond to hGH, whereas after preincubation of the cells, hGH produces a maximal 105% increase in glucose transport and a maximal 40% increase in glucose oxidation. In contrast, freshly isolated adipose cells from fa/fa rats are already responsive to hGH and the amplitude of the response is markedly elevated in preincubated cells, with a 430% stimulation of glucose transport. The concentration of hGH (1 nM) that inhibits 50% of [125I]hGH binding and that which produces half-maximal stimulation of glucose transport as well as glucose metabolism are not different, suggesting the absence of spare receptors for these insulin-like effects of hGH. Plots of GH effects on glucose transport as a function of receptor occupancy are linear, with a change in the slope after preincubation. Our results suggest a strong correlation between binding of hGH and actions on glucose transport and glucose metabolism in adipocytes of young Zucker rats.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated rat islets were incubated with myo-[2-3H]inositol to label their phosphoinositides (PI). Labeling was carried out in the presence of various glucose levels (2.75-10 mM) with or without human recombinant interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1). After the labeling period, insulin release, [3H]inositol efflux, and the accumulation of labeled inositol phosphates in perfused islets were assessed under various conditions. The following major observations were made. 1) In islets labeled for 2 h with [3H]inositol in the presence of 2.75 mM glucose, subsequent perifusion with 5.0 nM IL-1 increased insulin output, [3H]inositol efflux, and [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation in the simultaneous presence of 7 mM, but not 2.75 mM, glucose. 2) Mannoheptulose, a competitive inhibitor of islet glucokinase, blocked the stimulatory effects of IL-1 noted in the presence of 7 mM glucose. In other experiments, the conditions used during the 2-h labeling period with myo-[2-3H]inositol were varied. The following major observations were made in islets subsequently stimulated during the perifusion with 20 mM glucose. 3) Islets labeled with [3H]inositol in the presence of 2.75 mM glucose with or without 5.0 nM IL-1 responded with similar increases in PI hydrolysis and insulin output. 4) Compared to that with 2.75 mM glucose alone, labeling in the presence of 7 mM glucose alone was without any adverse effect on the subsequent PI and insulin responses of perifused islets to 20 mM glucose. 5) Labeling in the presence of 7 mM glucose plus 5.0 nM IL-1 resulted in a significant reduction in the subsequent PI and insulin responses. 6) These inhibitory effects of IL-1 were abolished if mannoheptulose was included during the 2-h incubation with 7 mM glucose plus 5.0 nM IL-1. 7) The diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor 1-monooleoylglycerol (100 microM) significantly restored insulin output after IL-1 exposure (with 7 mM glucose). 8) Similar to the results obtained with 7 mM glucose plus IL-1, incubation of islets with 8-10 mM glucose alone produced dose-dependent impairments of [3H]inositol efflux patterns and inositol phosphate accumulation. Insulin secretion was also impaired. These results demonstrate that IL-1 has glucose-dependent stimulatory and inhibitory effects on beta-cell function. Both effects appear to involve alterations in islet PI hydrolysis.\r"

  ".U": "89210514\r", 
  ".W": "Articular chondrocytes from 2- to 3-month-old rabbits were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with fibroblast growth factor. The effects were studied of GH, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and insulin on the production of IGF-I, IGF-II, and their binding proteins (BPs) and on cell multiplication. In the control culture medium, IGF-I levels were about one fifth those of IGF-II. Western blot analysis of the BPs revealed a predominant 30K form and 24K and 20K forms which appeared inconsistently and in small quantities. Ten to 100 ng/ml human GH had no mitogenic effect, and even had a slightly inhibitory effect. IGF-I at 10 ng/ml stimulated cell multiplication above the control level by 41% and at 50 ng/ml by 74%, whereas the mean increase obtained with IGF-II (10 and 50 ng/ml) was only 19%. At the same doses, insulin had no effect, but at 5 micrograms/ml it stimulated cell multiplication by a mean of 67%. There was a positive correlation between cell number and release into the medium of both IGF-I (r = 0.86) and IGF-II (r = 0.77). Neither IGF-I nor IGF-II production was affected by GH. Insulin (5 micrograms/ml) increased IGF-I production by a factor of 2.6, but increased IGF-II production by a factor of only 1.4. Under the various conditions of culture with different doses of GH and insulin, cell multiplication, relative to the control value was positively correlated to the IGF-I/IGF-II production ratio (r = 0.77). It would, therefore, seem that IGF-I secreted by the chondrocytes may stimulate their own proliferation. When IGFs or insulin were added to the culture medium, changes in the electrophoretic profiles of the BPs included an increase in the 30K form and an increase in or the appearance of the 24K and 20K forms. Ten and 50 ng/ml IGF-I or IGF-II had effects equal to or greater than those induced by 5 micrograms/ml insulin. These results indicate that the syntheses of BPs and IGFs are coordinated and that IGFs may be implicated in the control of the synthesis of their BPs.\r"

  ".U": "89210517\r", 
  ".W": "The posttranslational processing of prodynorphin (Pro-Dyn) is not well understood. The rat anterior pituitary is an interesting tissue which merits examination to address this issue since it is known that Dyn immunoreactivity is stored as high mol wt (HMW) intermediates and not as free products such as dynorphin-A-(1-17) (Dyn-A17) or dynorphin-B-(1-13) (Dyn-B). The aim of our study is to characterize the Pro-Dyn products in the rat anterior pituitary quantitatively as well as qualitatively by keeping a close account of each of the possible domains that are known to compose the protein structure. This was achieved by a convergence of tools: designing RIA with antibodies to each of these domains, including antibodies to Dyn-A17, Dyn-B, alpha-neo-endorphin, bridge peptide, and Pro-Dyn carboxyl-terminal peptide (C-peptide), and using these antisera with gel filtration chromatography, reverse phase HPLC, immunoaffinity, and immunoprecipitation techniques. Our data indicate the presence of at least six distinct molecules which are classified as HMW intermediates (greater than 3.5K). By gel filtration chromatography they have apparent mol wt of 16,000, 10,000, 8,000, 6,000, 4,000, and 3,500, respectively. Each of these structures is characterized by multiple immunoreactivities to account for the observed mass. Based on the relative content of each structure we present a scheme for the posttranslational processing pathway of Pro-Dyn in the rat anterior pituitary. We also analyze other tissues, spinal cord and hypothalamus, for their content of Pro-Dyn HMW intermediates. Our results indicate that these tissues store Pro-Dyn HMW molecules of similar sizes and immunoreactive properties, suggesting that Pro-Dyn may be processed in a similar manner, at least in the initial phases, across tissues.\r"

The objective of this study was to make a polyclonal antibody to these glycoproteins and then use the antibody to determine the presence of the glycoproteins in oviduct flushings, tissue culture media, and tissues obtained from cycling and steroid-treated baboons. Oviduct culture medium proteins from estradiol-treated baboons were separated on one-dimensional polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The region containing the glycoproteins was cut out, solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide, mixed with Freund's adjuvant, and injected at 2-week intervals into a male rabbit. The anti-serum used in this study was obtained 6 weeks after the initial injection and cross-reacted with antigens on Western blots of oviduct flushings and oviduct culture media obtained from follicular stage and estradiol-treated baboons. The antigens were absent in oviduct flushings obtained from luteal stage, ovariectomized and estradiol-primed baboons treated with estradiol and progesterone or progesterone alone. The antigens were not detected on Western blots of other reproductive and nonreproductive tract culture media or in serum obtained from follicular stage or estradiol-treated baboons. Immunoperoxidase staining was limited to discrete granules in the apical cytoplasm of secretory cells in oviducts obtained from follicular stage and estradiol-treated baboons. Thus, the secretory cells of the baboon oviduct synthesize and secrete a family of estradiol-dependent oviduct-specific glycoproteins that may have potential functional significance during fertilization and embryo development.\r"

Scatchard and Hill analyses of specific binding revealed a single class of noninteracting binding sites with a high affinity (Kd = 0.72 nM) and a moderate density (binding capacity = 32.16 fmol/mg protein). The biologically active tachykinins, which, in addition to SP, consist of physalaemin, eledoisin, kassinin, neurokinin-A, and neurokinin-B, could inhibit the binding in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on titration curves, the IC50 values of the tachykinins were measured, and the receptor was classified as a NK-1 receptor. These results demonstrate that a population of specific SP-binding sites is present in rat anterior pituitary and further support evidence that this peptide has an influence on pituitary function.\r"

  ".U": "89210539\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study we have examined the effects of estradiol on mRNA levels for estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in the estrogen-dependent mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cell line. The changes in ER immunoactivity and specific binding of [3H]R5020 were also assessed. Estradiol (10(-7) M) caused a transient and time-dependent reduction of the level of mRNA for ER, with a maximal effect (30-40% of control; n = 3) after 72 h. This was associated with a similar decrease in ER immunoactivity. Further treatment (96 and 120 h) revealed a return of ER mRNA to control values, whereas the ER immunoactivity remained depressed. The effect on the mRNA level for PR gave almost the inverse curve. Initially (24-72 h), we observed a pronounced increase in this mRNA, with a maximal effect (6-7 times the control value; n = 3) after 72 h. Treatment beyond 72 h was associated with a gradual return of mRNA for PR toward the control level. The variation in specific binding of [3H]R5020 revealed similar changes, except that changes in specific receptor binding were delayed 24 h compared to the levels of mRNA. Incubation with low concentrations (10(-11) and 10(-10) M) of estradiol for 72 h was associated with slightly elevated levels of mRNA for ER, whereas higher concentrations gave a dose-dependent decrease. The mRNA for PR was biphasically stimulated, with a maximal effect at 10(-10)-10(-8) M, where a 10- to 13-fold stimulation was observed. The highest concentration (10(-7) M) gave a lower response. Assessment of concentration-induced variations in protein receptor levels of ER and PR reflected the effects of estradiol on their mRNAs. Low concentrations of estradiol slightly enhanced the ER level, whereas high concentrations clearly reduced ER immunoactivity. The PR level was stimulated by all concentrations used, and 10(-8) M estradiol raised the PR level more than 11-fold. Our results indicate autologous regulation of estrogen receptor gene transcripts and proteins and a clear induction of PR mRNA and receptor proteins by estradiol.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of hypoinsulinemia and liver somatogenic (GH) receptors in growth retardation and decreased serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels during protein restriction, we have used a rat model where the effects of a low protein intake on body weight (BW), serum IGF-I concentration, and liver GH binding could be evaluated in the presence of low or high insulin concentrations. Two days after being made diabetic with streptozotocin (60 mg/kg BW), 6-week-old female rats (nine per group) were begun on a low (5%) or normal (15%) protein diet, without or with insulin supplementation (3 U lente daily). Nondiabetic rats fed both diets were used as controls (nine per group). In the nondiabetic animals, 7 days of protein restriction reduced BW gain by 50% (P less than 0.001), serum insulin by 44% (P less than 0.025), and serum IGF-I concentrations by 28% (P less than 0.001) without significantly changing liver GH binding. By day 9, BW was decreased in the diabetic animals by 12%, serum insulin by 80%, serum IGF-I by 55%, and liver GH binding by 62%; these effects were similar in the 5% and 15% protein-fed rats (P less than 0.001 vs. the corresponding controls). In the diabetes fed the normal diet, insulin treatment restored BW gain, serum IGF-I, and liver GH binding to normal values. In contrast, in the diabetics fed a protein-restricted diet and treated with insulin, BW gain and serum IGF-I concentrations remained low, similar to those in the malnourished controls. This diet-induced growth attenuation was observed despite high circulating insulin (2-3 times normal values), appropriate glucose control (63 +/- 9 mg/dl), and near restoration of liver GH binding. We conclude that while both protein restriction and diabetes attenuate growth and reduce IGF-I concentrations, the effects of protein restriction are independent of the effects of insulin and probably act by alteration of postreceptor mechanisms.\r"

Multifactorial polygenic and familial factors are involved in their formation. The result may be deficient development (agenesis, rudimentary horn, unicornuate uterus), nonfusion (didelphys or bicornuate uterus), or defective canalization of the mullerian ducts (septate uterus). The principal diagnostic procedures include HSG, laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, and US. The clinical presentation varies from symptoms of obstruction of the menstrual flow in adolescence to hypomenorrhea and fertility problems in adult life. Repeated fetal loss, after excluding other reasons, is usually the indication for surgical intervention. Uterine septa should be resected hysteroscopically. A prophylactic cerclage has been suggested by various authors, including those of this work, in cases of symmetric uterine anomalies, especially bicornuate uteri, as a simple and effective treatment to be tried before embarking on major surgery such as metroplasty.\r"

Overall, it was found that exact agreement occurred in 15 (24%), but disagreement of more than 2 days occurred in 6 (10%). The proportion of exact agreement in the first half of the luteal phase (32%) was found to be significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than that in the second half of the luteal phase (9%). In a separate part of the study, 27 women had two endometrial biopsies, each performed in a separate cycle. The within-subject between-cycle variation of the results of endometrial dating (exact agreement: 4%, disagreement of more than 2 days: 41%) was found to be significantly different from intraobserver variation (P less than 0.01 for both). The amount of intraobserver variation suggests that the traditional dating criteria are not precise enough to quantify corpus luteum function in the second half of the luteal phase, whereas the amount of within-subject between-cycle variation implies that the result of endometrial dating in one cycle cannot be used reliably to predict that of another cycle.\r"

After laparoscopy and/or conservative surgery, the patients were treated with danazol for 6 months and a second laparoscopy was performed. The LH-RH/TRH test was carried out in the third month of danazol treatment in 6 endometriosis patients and before the second laparoscopy in 11 patients. The results show that there was both an increase in the mean basal levels of PRL and in the percentage of cases of moderate hyperprolactinemia in endometriosis patients. There also was a greater rise in PRL with the LH-RH/TRH test in moderate and severe endometriosis. The PRL response was significantly greater in endometriosis than in normal women, and was not related to TSH response. Danazol treatment reduced significantly the PRL response. The PRL response before treatment was significantly higher in patients who after treatment showed persistent endometriosis at the second laparoscopy. This could suggest a lower effectiveness of danazol in patients with endometriosis and a PRL hyper-response to LH-RH/TRH.\r"

Thirty-three semen samples from infertile men and 17 fertile controls were studied. Despite significant differences on the sperm penetration assay, univariate comparisons of movement characteristics between infertile and control samples failed to detect differences. For all samples combined, significant alterations in movement characteristics were detected after washing. After an 18-hour sperm capacitation, mean velocity, head yawing amplitude, and head yawing frequency still were significantly increased over seminal plasma values. Videomicrographic motion analysis thus allows detection of changes that are consistent with hyperactivated motility, as has been described for capacitating spermatozoa.\r"

In samples from normospermic (n = 55), oligospermic (n = 26), and asthenospermic (n = 29) men, the Percoll technique significantly improved yield, percent motility, and absolute number of motile sperm recovered, but in samples from oligoasthenospermic men (n = 18), only percent motility was improved. The Percoll density gradient also selected sperm with markedly improved function as assessed by both the sperm penetration assay and the fertility index. In 37 samples negative on the sperm penetration assay when processed with the swim-up technique, 19 (51%) became positive when processed with the Percoll technique. The Percoll density gradient is an improved method for semen manipulation as it allows greater recovery of sperm with higher motility and improved sperm function.\r"

To further elucidate their role in sperm physiology, we studied semen samples from 49 infertile men and 25 men with proven fertility. beta-endorphin and calcitonin were measured in each sample by radioimmunoassay and then were correlated with seminal plasma testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone levels as well as sperm count, total motile sperm/milliliter, and percentage of penetrated hamster eggs. The levels of beta-endorphin (308 +/- 22 pg/ml) and calcitonin (331 +/- 32 pg/ml) in seminal plasma were 10 and 20 times higher than levels found in venous plasma (32 +/- 2 and 14.5 +/- 1.2 pg/ml, respectively) (P less than 0.001). There was no difference between the levels of beta-endorphin and calcitonin in seminal plasma of fertile and infertile men. However, seminal plasma T was significantly higher in fertile than infertile men (19.4 +/- 2 versus 11.5 +/- 1 ng/dl; P less than 0.05). No correlation could be demonstrated between either beta-endorphin or calcitonin and any of the parameters studied. In conclusion, beta-endorphin and calcitonin are produced locally in the male reproductive tract; however, their role in male reproduction remains to be elucidated.\r"

Essential tremor consists of postural and kinetic tremors which may involve the hands, head, and voice. Approximately 50% of cases are hereditary. Significant disability may occur. Propranolol and primidone provide effective treatment for some patients. The tremor of Parkinson's disease occurs in resting and postural positions. Treatment with levodopa usually reduces the tremor. Anticholinergics may also decrease tremor but often cause mental side effects in the elderly. Disturbances of the cerebellum may cause a kinetic tremor of the extremities or shakiness of the trunk. Tremors may also occur on a psychogenic basis. Proper classification of tremor disorder will lead to appropriate diagnosis and, often, effective treatment.\r"

Two thirds of these patients are over age 60, and two thirds also have either full penetration of the bowel wall or metastases to regional lymph nodes. Mass screening via tests for occult blood in the stool is invaluable for detecting early carcinomas of the colon and rectum. Digital examination, endoscopy, and barium contrast radiographs help to confirm the diagnosis. Tumors of the colon and rectum are best treated operatively with appropriate lymphadenectomy and adequate margins, both proximally and distally, to guard against local recurrence. Certain factors, such as mucinous tumors, microinvasion, and non-exophytic tumors of the rectum have been shown to have a propensity for local recurrence. Local treatment by fulguration or electrocoagulation is advocated only for tiny tumors confined to a polyp, or for the extremely elderly or poor-risk patient. Radiation therapy appears to be an appropriate adjuvant to the treatment of rectal cancer either preoperatively or postoperatively.\r"

There is also a reduction in the relaxation rate of the ventricle. In the subclinical state, the aged heart cell undergoes enlargement, but this has not been described in diabetes. In an unknown portion of patients with subclinical abnormalities, the process may advance to abnormalities of systolic function, heart failure, and arrhythmias. There is no convincing evidence that intramural small vessel disease can account for the diffuse cardiomyopathy of these two states. Management requires a particularly cautious use of cardioactive agents.\r"

In patients having surgery at radiological evaluation there was gullet diameter significantly increased at the oesophagogastric junction and decreased at the middle third of the oesophagus. One patient was lost from follow up and one died of an oesophageal carcinoma, leaving 95% of excellent results at the late follow up (median 62 months). Resting gastro-oesophageal sphincter pressure decreased significantly to approximately 10 mmHg; this was maintained five years after surgery. By contrast, in patients having pneumatic dilatation, there were good results in only 65% (follow up median 58 months), with 30% failures. One patient was lost from follow up and one developed oesophageal carcinoma. Measurement of resting gastro-oesophageal sphincter pressure after dilatation was highly predictive of the outcome.

Bioavailability in these two patients fell below 8% and to around 1% in a further patient with severe graft dysfunction. Clamping reduced the metabolic clearance of cyclosporin A by only 25% from a mean before clamping of 2.9 ml/min/kg to 2.3 ml/min/kg (n = 11).

Coagulation factor values in the initial (baseline) blood samples varied by patient diagnosis. In general, all factor levels were reduced except factor VIII:C, which was increased to almost twice normal. The slight intraoperative changes in factors II, VII, IX, X, XI and XII suggested that a steady-state relationship existed between depletion (consumption/bleeding) and repletion (transfusion, transit from extra- to intravascular space), even in the anhepatic state. In contrast, there were rapid and very significant falls in factor VIII and fibrinogen and a less pronounced decrease in factor V, all reaching their nadirs in early to mid-Stage III.

Of these, 94 cases were diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma of a moderately or poorly differentiated type with classical histologic features of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 14 cases in whom hepatocytes had minimal atypical changes and were mostly of normotrabecular arrangement (one to two cells thick), a diagnosis of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma was made on the basis of the following three histologic criteria: nuclear crowding, increased cytoplasmic basophilia and microacinar formation. The nodules which showed two or more of these findings were diagnosed as well-differentiated HCC. The diagnoses of these 14 cases were subsequently confirmed by clinical course, histology in the resected specimen and/or autopsy findings. The nodules that presented similar but equivocal changes were arbitrarily categorized as borderline lesions (five cases). The nodules showing the findings almost identical with those of pseudolobules were regarded as benign, large regenerative nodules (nine cases). The remaining one case had a hemangioma. Thus, these three histologic criteria proved to be useful in the biopsy diagnosis of nodular hepatic lesions, with certain limitations. Additionally, the majority of large regenerative nodules, borderline lesions and well-differentiated HCCs were found to be smaller than 2 cm.\r"

  ".W": "Secretory immunoglobulin A is the characteristic and predominant immunoglobulin of the mucosal immune system; it participates in immunological protection at the level of mucous membrane surfaces. During the past 10 to 15 years, a great deal of experimental and clinical evidence has shown that the liver is very much involved in the sIgA system. In certain animals (rats, mice, rabbits), polymeric forms of IgA are efficiently cleared by the liver and transported into bile by a receptor-mediated vesicular pathway across hepatocytes. Taking advantage of this easily accessible pathway, investigators have defined many of the events in the external secretion of pIgA, including details about the synthesis and secretion of its receptor, secretory component. In the rat hepatocyte, secretory component is synthesized as a transmembrane glycoprotein and is expressed preferentially on the sinusoidal plasma membrane; circulating pIgA that binds to secretory component is internalized into endocytic vesicles and transported across the hepatocyte to the bile canalicular membrane, where the pIgA is released into bile as a soluble complex with a portion of the secretory component, the complex being secretory IgA. In some other animals (dog, guinea pig, sheep) as well as man, biliary epithelial cells, not hepatocytes, express secretory component and perform the transcytosis and secretion of pIgA into bile. In those species, much of the pIgA that reaches bile is synthesized locally in plasma cells that populate the biliary tree; this design is analogous to the release of sIgA into various mucosae in the body. The major biological functions ascribed to the secretion of IgA into bile are enhancement of immunological defense of the biliary and upper intestinal tracts and the clearance of harmful antigens from the circulation as IgA-antigen complexes. However, the importance of biliary IgA antibodies is largely unclarified, and man lacks the capacity for effective clearance of IgA-antigen complexes via the secretory component-mediated transhepatocellular pathway; whether this deficit contributes to the propensity for man to develop IgA immune complex diseases should be clarified. Among liver diseases, alcoholic disease is most closely linked to alterations in IgA metabolism. This association is manifested principally by the deposition of IgA along the sinusoids in the livers of the majority of alcoholics and in the renal mesangium of many.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "One major goal of dialysis therapy has become the removal of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m). The interdialytic elimination of beta 2-m was studied using a newly developed high-flux cellulose acetate (CA) membrane. The results show that high-flux CA dialyzers offer better biocompatibility than classical Cuprophan or high-flux Cuprophan devices, with regard to leukopenia, C3a desarg generation, and elastase release from polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes. Compared to high-flux CA membranes, high-flux PMMA membranes induce less C3a desarg formation but comparable leukopenia. High-flux PMMA membranes, however cause greater leukocyte stimulation than CA as demonstrated by more PMN elastase release during hemodialysis. Using high-flux CA or high-flux PMMA membranes, serum beta 2-m levels decreased 32% during dialysis. Serum beta 2-m dropped 10% with high-flux Cuprophan membranes, but remained unchanged with conventional Cuprophan dialyzers. Sieving coefficients for beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) were virtually zero with classical Cuprophan and 0.66 with high-flux cellulose acetate membranes. High-flux membranes made of Cuprophan and PMMA gave coefficients of 0.25 and 0.45, respectively. This indicates the high removal capacity of the new CA-membrane for substances with high molecular weight. This high-flux CA membrane thus appears to combine a good degree of biocompatibility with a high capacity for beta 2-m removal.\r"

  ".W": "Research on the short-term effects of psychological interventions in migraine indicates improvement rates of 50 percent. Yet long-term follow-ups are scarce: the studies extending to three years provide evidence for the maintenance of effects, but these studies evaluate the benefits of rather complex psychological treatments and the samples include other types of headache. We compared the effects of single-method psychological interventions upon migraine. The study reports results obtained from 24 patients three years after completion of relaxation training, which is a psychophysiological regimen, and stress-coping training, which is a cognitive-behavioral regimen. Results for the complete sample, excluding data biased by confounding factors, provide clear evidence of the preservation of effects in migraine. Relaxation training (RT) and stress-coping training (SCT) were equally effective and both groups exhibited little medication consumption since completion of training. Among the secondary effects, SCT was found to improve assertiveness and active problem solving, and to decrease depressive reaction. The study yielded two predictor variables--little external stress for relaxation training, and high self motivation for stress-coping training--that accounted for more than 50 percent of the effect variance in the respective groups. Although more research is needed to substantiate our findings, the results suggest that, thus far, there is little reason to favor multimodal training or more complex psychological treatments over single-method psychological interventions in migraine. Also, our results do not support the assumed superiority of cognitive-behavioral treatment over psychophysiological treatment. Research on factors predicting long-term effects of psychological interventions in migraine may profit from considering separate variables on skill rehearsal and skill employment (instead of employing a global measure of home practice), and from a measure for post-training external stress.\r"

It was also found that inability to handwarm at session one of thermal biofeedback training was predictive of treatment success, as was the ability to achieve a fingertip temperature of at least 96.0 degrees F at any point in thermal biofeedback training.

Pretreatment with TNF/C and IL-1 also increased, albeit slightly, lung G6PDH and GR activities of rats exposed to hyperoxia for 4 or 16 h. By comparison, no differences occurred in lung antioxidant enzyme activities of TNF/C and IL-1- or saline-pretreated rats exposed to hyperoxia for 36 or 52 h; the latter is a time just before untreated rats began to succumb during exposure to hyperoxia. The results raise the possibility that TNF/C and IL-1 treatment can increase lung antioxidant enzyme activities and that increased lung antioxidant enzymes may contribute to the increased survival of TNF/C and IL-1-pretreated rats in hyperoxia for greater than 72 h.\r"

The effects of porcine endothelin on the pulmonary vascular bed and systemic vascular bed were investigated in the anesthetized, intact-chest cat under conditions of constant pulmonary blood flow and left atrial pressure. Intralobar bolus injections of porcine endothelin (100-1000 ng) produced a mild vasoconstrictor response in the pulmonary vascular bed. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to endothelin was not altered when pulmonary vasomotor tone was increased by infusion of U46619. In contrast to this mild pulmonary vasoconstrictor response, endothelin decreased systemic arterial pressure. Moreover, injections of porcine endothelin into the right and left atria produced similar reductions in aortic pressure as well as similar increases in cardiac output and decreases in systemic vascular resistance. The systemic vasodilator response to porcine endothelin was not affected by beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade. The present data suggest that endothelin does not undergo significant first-pass pulmonary metabolism. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to bolus injections of porcine endothelin is not altered by changes in pulmonary vasomotor tone. In contrast, endothelin markedly dilated the systemic vascular bed independently of activation of beta 2-adrenoceptors. The present study provides the first report of the activity of endothelin on pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics in vivo. Moreover, the potent vasodilator activity of endothelin in the systemic vascular bed and its weak effect on pulmonary vessels suggest that endothelin may be more important in the regulation of peripheral vasomotor tone than the pulmonary vascular bed.\r"

  ".W": "The electrical activity of the respiratory skeletal muscles is altered in response to reflexes originating in the gastrointestinal tract. The present study evaluated the reflex effects of esophageal distension (ED) on the distribution of motor activity to both inspiratory and expiratory muscles of the rib cage and abdomen and the resultant changes in thoracic and abdominal pressure during breathing. Studies were performed in 21 anesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs. ED was produced by inflating a balloon in the distal esophagus. ED decreased the activity of the costal and crural diaphragm and external intercostals and abolished all preexisting electrical activity in the expiratory muscles of the abdominal wall. On the other hand, ED increased the activity of the parasternal intercostals and expiratory muscles located in the rib cage (i.e., triangularis sterni and internal intercostal). All effects of ED were graded, with increasing distension exerting greater effects, and were eliminated by vagotomy. The effect of increases in chemical drive and lung inflation reflex activity on the response to ED was examined by performing ED while animals breathed either 6.5% CO2 or against graded levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respectively. Changes in respiratory muscle electrical activity induced by ED were similar (during 6.5% CO2 and PEEP) to those observed under control conditions. We conclude that activation of mechanoreceptors in the esophagus reflexly alters the distribution of motor activity to the respiratory muscles, inhibiting the muscles surrounding the abdominal cavity and augmenting the parasternals and expiratory muscles of the chest wall.\r"

NAD and AT caused identical decreases in exercise heart rates, but endurance (71 +/- 8 min with PLAC) decreased significantly more with NAD (-33 +/- 4%) than with AT (-14 +/- 6%). Muscle glycogen breakdown, taking exercise time into account, was unaffected by treatment. In contrast, muscle triglyceride utilization was completely blocked by NAD whereas it was unchanged with AT as compared to PLAC. Adipose tissue lipolysis was inhibited to a similar extent by the two beta-blockers. Serum potassium increased to higher levels at exhaustion and muscle potassium decreased to lower levels with NAD than with AT or PLAC. These results suggest that decreased utilization of muscle triglycerides combined with lack of an enhanced glycogenolysis to compensate as well as alterations in potassium metabolism contribute to the decreased exercise capacity with nonselective beta-blockade compared with beta 1-selective blockade.\r"

Measurements were made before and weekly for 4 wk after elastase in five rats. In four rats measurements were made before and at 3 wk after elastase; in these same animals the effects of changes in end-expiratory lung volume on the airway responses to MCh were evaluated before and after elastase. Airway responses were determined from peak pulmonary resistance (RL) calculated after 30-s aerosolizations of saline and doubling concentrations of MCh from 1 to 64 mg/ml. Porcine pancreatic elastase (1 IU/g) was administered intratracheally. Before elastase RL rose from 0.20 +/- 0.02 cmH2O.ml-1.s (mean +/- SE; n = 9) to 0.57 +/- 0.06 after MCh (64 mg/ml). A plateau was observed in the concentration-response curve. Static compliance and the maximum increase in RL (delta RL64) were significantly correlated (r = 0.799, P less than 0.01). Three weeks after elastase the maximal airway response to MCh was enhanced and no plateau was observed; delta RL64 was 0.78 +/- 0.07 cmH2O.ml-1.s, significantly higher than control delta RL64 (0.36 +/- 0.7, P less than 0.05). Before elastase, increase of end-expiratory lung volume to functional residual capacity + 1.56 ml (+/- 0.08 ml) significantly reduced RL at 64 mg MCh/ml from 0.62 +/- 0.05 cmH2O.ml-1.s to 0.50 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.05.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This report describes the pulmonary vascular response of infant lamb lung to abrupt cessation of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during volume-regulated continuous positive-pressure breathing (CPPB). In an intact, endobronchially ventilated preparation, the increase in left lung blood flow (QL) after abrupt cessation of 11 Torr left lung PEEP was found to be gradual, although peak airway pressure (Pmax) fell promptly from 36 to 14 Torr; 49% of the increase in QL occurred greater than 10 s after cessation of PEEP. Recruitment of zone I vasculature that had been created by balloon occlusion of the left pulmonary artery was found to occur promptly after balloon deflation. Isolated neonatal lamb lungs, perfused at constant flow rate, showed similar persistent elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance after cessation of 15 Torr PEEP, although Pmax fell abruptly from 39 to 12 Torr. This hysteresis was eliminated by calcium channel blockade with verapamil, and the magnitude of the change in pulmonary arterial pressure after either application or cessation of PEEP was reduced (25 and 26%, respectively). These observations suggest that, during CPPB, lung stretch alters neonatal pulmonary vascular tone or, by causing calcium channel-dependent lung volume hysteresis, modulates pulmonary vascular resistance. This interaction exaggerates the effect of airway pressure changes on pulmonary vascular resistance during mechanical ventilation.\r"

Results were compared with findings in seven untrained subjects (VO2max 44 +/- 2 ml.min-1.kg-1) studied both at rest (UT) and after 60 min of bicycle exercise at 150 W (UT-ex). In T and UT-ex compared with UT, sensitivity for insulin-mediated whole-body glucose uptake was higher [insulin concentrations eliciting half-maximal glucose uptake being 44 +/- 2 (T) and 43 +/- 4 (UT-ex) vs. 52 +/- 3 microU/ml (UT), P less than 0.05] and responsiveness was higher [13.4 +/- 1.2 (T) and 10.9 +/- 0.7 (UT-ex) vs. 9.5 +/- 0.7 mg.min-1.kg-1 (UT), P less than 0.05]. Furthermore, responsiveness was higher (P less than 0.05) in T than in UT-ex. Insulin-stimulated O2 uptake and maximal glucose oxidation rate were higher in T than in UT and UT-ex. Insulin-stimulated conversion or glucose to glycogen and muscle glycogen synthase was higher in T than in UT and UT-ex. However, glycogen storage in vastus lateralis muscle was found only in UT-ex. No change in any glucoregulatory hormone or metabolite could explain the increased insulin action in trained subjects. It is concluded that physical training induces an adaptive increase in insulin responsiveness of whole-body glucose uptake, which does not reflect increased glycogen deposition in muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight subjects cycled for 2 h on three separate occasions to deplete their muscle glycogen stores.

  ".W": "We evaluated the dose response to a stable thromboxane (Tx) A2 analogue (sTxA2; 0.3-30 micrograms) in the pulmonary circulation and its effect on the distribution of pressure gradients determined by the occlusion technique in isolated nonblood perfused newborn lamb lungs. The total pulmonary pressure gradient (delta Pt) was partitioned into pressure drops across the relatively indistensible arteries and veins (delta Pv) and relatively compliant vessels. We also evaluated the effects of prostacyclin (PGI2) and a Tx receptor antagonist (ONO 3708) on the sTxA2-induced pulmonary responses. Injection of sTxA2 caused a dose-related increase in the pulmonary arterial pressure, with the primary component of the increase in delta Pt (4.1 +/- 0.8 to 13.9 +/- 0.4 Torr) at 30 micrograms derived from the prominent rise in delta Pv (1.8 +/- 0.3 to 9.8 +/- 0.9 Torr). Infusion of PGI2 (0.4 microgram.kg-1.min-1) reduced the response to sTxA2 mainly by attenuating the delta Pv elevation. Infusion of ONO 3708 (100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) completely abolished the sTxA2-induced pulmonary hypertension. Injection of sTxA2 resulted in pulmonary edema characterized by a significant increase in wet-to-dry lung weight ratio (9.13 +/- 0.35 vs. 7.15 +/- 0.41 in control lungs). The sTxA2-induced pulmonary edema was increased by PGI2 and inhibited by ONO 3708. We conclude that thromboxane-induced pulmonary hypertension is primarily produced by venoconstriction and prostacyclin may worsen the edema induced by thromboxane.\r"

Eleven subjects, including three current and four former asthmatics, were studied. RL, airway resistance (Raw), and, by subtraction, tissue viscance (Vtis) were measured at different lung volumes before and after a deep inhalation and were repeated after methacholine (MCh) aerosols up to maximal levels of constriction. Vtis, which average 9% of RL at base line, was unchanged by MCh and was not changed after deep inhalation but increased directly with lung volume. MCh aerosols induced constriction by increasing Raw, which was reversed by deep inhalation in inverse proportion to responsiveness. such that the more responsive subjects reversed less after a deep breath. Responsiveness correlated directly with the degree of maximal constriction, as more responsive subjects constricted to a greater degree. These results indicate that in humans Vtis comprises a small fraction of overall RL, which is clearly volume-dependent but unchanged by MCh-induced constriction and unrelated to the degree of responsiveness of the subject.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of continuous heat exposure on the nocturnal patterns of renin, aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol, six young men were exposed to thermoneutral environment for 5 days, followed by a 5-day acclimation period in a hot dry environment (35 degrees C). Blood was collected at 10-min intervals during the second night at thermoneutrality (N0) and during the first (N1) and the last (N5) nights of heat exposure. Polygraphic recordings of sleep were scored according to established criteria. Continuous heat exposure led to progressive decreases in the 24-h urinary volume and in Na excretion, whereas urinary osmolality increased. After 5 days of uninterrupted heat, significant increases were found in plasma volume (P less than 0.05), osmolality (P less than 0.01), plasma Na (P less than 0.01), and protein levels (P less than 0.05). Sweat gland output increased during the first 3 days and then declined without any concomitant increases in body temperature. Compared with N0, there were no differences in plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone (PA) profiles during N1 at 35 degrees C. However, during N5 the mean PRA and PA levels were significantly (P less than 0.05) enhanced, and their nocturnal oscillations were amplified (P less than 0.05). This amplification occurred mainly in the second part of the night when regular rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep cycles were observed, leading to a general upward trend in the nocturnal profiles. The relationship between the nocturnal PRA oscillations and the sleep cycles was not modified. ACTH and cortisol patterns were not affected by continuous heat exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A differentiation-arrested primary cell culture model was used to examine the role of reactive oxygen species in the control of prostacyclin (PGI2) production in the perinatal rat lung. Coincubation of the lung cells with arachidonic acid (AA) and xanthine (X, 0.25 mM) plus xanthine oxidase (XO, 10 mU/ml) or with AA and glucose (25 mM) plus glucose oxidase (25 mU/ml) augmented the AA-induced PGI2 output. Superoxide dismutase (10 U/ml) did not alter the X + XO effect, whereas catalase (10 U/ml) eliminated both X + XO and glucose plus glucose oxidase effects. H2O2 (1-200 microM) showed a dose-related biphasic augmentation with peak stimulation at 20 microM. Catalase again blocked this effect, but dimethylthiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, did not. A 20-min pretreatment of the cells with X + XO, glucose plus glucose oxidase, or H2O2, however, diminished the capacity of the cells to convert exogenous AA to PGI2. This pretreatment effect was also blocked by catalase. The responses were similar in lung cells obtained from day 20 rat fetuses (term = 22 days) and 1-day-old newborn rats. Lactate dehydrogenase release was not detected during treatment periods but increased significantly after exposure to reactive oxygen species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Administration of 1 nmol substance P without enzyme inhibitors resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) increase in the peak PaO during ventilation from 12.4 +/- 0.5 to 22.4 +/- 2.2 cmH2O; there were small statistically insignificant increases in Ppa. The changes in PaO peaked approximately 30 s after peptide infusion and returned to preinfusion values by 5 min. In the presence of combined thiorphan (5.6 microM) and captopril (7.7 microM) the magnitude of the Pao response at 30 s (41.5 +/- 3.8 cmH2O) and at 5 min (40.0 +/- 3.6 cmH2O) after peptide infusion was significantly greater than in control lungs (P less than 0.05). The effects of substance P on PaO in the presence of the various inhibitors were not related to amount of peptide recovered in the lung effluent. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of [3H]Pro2,4 substance P perfused through the lungs demonstrated that the major products were consistent with intact substance P, substance P 1-4, and smaller peptides; only minor amounts of products consistent with substance P 1-7, 1-9, or 3-11 were identified. These data support our previous findings showing that the physiological effects of intravascular substance P are limited by peptide degradation; the latter process, once begun, proceeds rapidly to nearly complete peptide degradation.\r"

Preascent plasma total cholesterol concentration ([TC]) was decreased by 25% after the 40-day exposure (P less than 0.01). High-density lipoprotein concentrations ([HDL-C]) decreased 32% (P less than 0.001) with no alteration in the TC-to-HDL-C weight ratio. Plasma triglyceride concentration increased twofold during this period (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in fasting plasma free fatty acid concentrations or free fatty acid-to-albumin molar ratio throughout the study. Fasting plasma insulin levels were increased approximately twofold with no significant changes in glucagon concentration or the insulin-to-glucagon molar ratio. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were increased threefold on reaching 282 Torr (P less than 0.01), with no significant changes in plasma epinephrine concentrations. Mean energy intake (kcal/day) decreased 42%, whereas mean body weights decreased by 8.9 +/- 0.8% (P less than 0.01) with exposure. Increased concentrations of insulin may lead to increased hepatic production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, thus eliciting metabolic changes independent of weight loss and dietary intake.\r"

After gastrointestinal tract colonization with C. albicans, mice were initially subjected to a 20% total body surface area, full-thickness, dorsal scald burn. Only one mouse in the burned group (5%) had evidence of C. albicans in the liver at the time the mice were killed. No dissemination was observed in sham-burned animals. When mice were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, an increased incidence of gastrointestinal tract dissemination was noted in burned (31%) and sham-burned (23%) mice; however, only 3 days after burn was there a significant difference in dissemination between burned and sham-burned mice (p less than 0.02). This corresponded to the day of severest neutropenia in response to cyclophosphamide treatment. The results of the study indicate that C. albicans can disseminate from the gastrointestinal tract in response to thermal injury, but a significant suppression of the immune response must occur for the event to be commonplace.\r"

There are valid reasons, however, to believe that cardiac surgery had its origin nearly a century earlier with the operative drainage of the pericardium by the little known Spanish surgeon, Francisco Romero, and highly regarded Baron Dominique Jean Larrey. This procedure entailed making a thoracic incision and opening and draining the pericardium. It must necessarily be considered a cardiac operation. The pericardium is part of the heart; its epicardium continues as the serosal layer of the fibrous pericardium; the pericardium is fused to the heart's base and great vessels; all books on heart surgery include pericardial operations. When Romero first operated is unknown, but it antedated 1814 when his work was presented in Paris; Larrey's operation was performed in 1810. These contributions are presented, and their priority with regard to the later initial efforts to suture myocardial laceration is reviewed briefly.\r"

  ".W": "Tryptase, a neutral protease of human mast cells, is a potentially important indicator of mast cell involvement in various clinical conditions. The current study examined the time course of appearance and disappearance of tryptase in the circulation after an anaphylactic event and the stability of both endogenous and exogenous tryptase in terms of freeze-thawing and temperature. The peak level of tryptase after an experimentally induced systemic anaphylactic reaction occurred 1-2 h after the initiating bee sting in each of three subjects, in contrast to histamine levels which peaked at 5-10 min. In some cases elevated levels of tryptase may not be detected during the initial 15-30 min. Tryptase levels then declined under apparent first order kinetics with a t1/2 of approximately 2h. Similar disappearance kinetics were observed for two subjects presenting in the emergency room with immediate type reactions, one with severe asthma after indomethacin ingestion, the other with systemic anaphylaxis after a bee sting. Histamine levels declined rapidly and were back to baseline by 15-60 min. Measured levels of tryptase in serum or plasma were not diminished by up to four freeze-thaw cycles. Incubation of serum samples taken from subjects with elevated levels of tryptase at 22 and 37 degrees C indicated that greater than 50% of endogenous tryptase was still detected after 4 d. Purified tryptase added to serum or plasma and incubated as above was less stable: approximately 50% of exogenous tryptase in serum and approximately 15% in plasma was detected after 2d of incubation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Subacute cutaneous lupus and neonatal lupus are closely associated with the presence of anti-Ro (SSA) autoantibodies, but there is no direct evidence establishing a role for anti-Ro (SSA) in these diseases. After parental injection into mice, IgG from sera containing anti-Ro (SSA) will bind human skin grafted onto the mice. To determine whether the antibody binding is due to anti-Ro (SSA), affinity-purified anti-Ro (SSA) and serum depleted of anti-Ro (SSA) were prepared. After injection into human skin-grafted mice, purified anti-Ro (SSA) antibodies bound an antigen in the human skin graft, while preabsorbing anti-Ro (SSA) serum with Ro (SSA) virtually abolished binding to the human skin graft. Moreover, the pattern of IgG deposition was primarily epidermal and was identical in the human skin-grafted mice injected with purified anti-Ro (SSA) when compared with that found in five patients with subacute lupus (four adults, one neonate). These data directly show that anti-Ro (SSA) antibodies bind to the skin, and support the hypothesis that anti-Ro (SSA) autoantibodies are involved in the disease process that produces subacute cutaneous lupus and neonatal lupus.\r"

To obtain highly purified colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-E), we cultured partially purified human blood burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) in methylcellulose with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) for 7 d and generated cells that consisted of 30-60% CFU-E, but no BFU-E. A serum-free medium was used that allowed development of the same number of erythroid colonies as serum containing medium, but with a greater percentage of larger colonies. This medium consisted of delipidated crystalline bovine serum albumin, iron saturated transferrin, lipid suspension, fibrinogen, thrombin, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium/F-12[HAM], and insulin plus rHuEPO. When CFU-E were cultured in a limiting dilution assay and the percentage of nonresponder wells was plotted against cell concentration, both serum-free cultures and serum-containing cultures yielded overlapping straight lines through the origin indicating that CFU-E development did not depend on accessory cells and that insulin acted directly on the CFU-E. Human recombinant interleukin 3 (IL-3) and/or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor had no effect on CFU-E growth, while they markedly enhanced BFU-E growth. Physiological concentrations of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) enhanced CFU-E growth in the absence of insulin and, together with rHuEPO in serum-free medium, provided a plating efficiency equal to that of serum-containing medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

IGF-I was also infused while maintaining euglycemia (glucose clamp technique) and its effects were compared to those of insulin. IGF-I infusion caused a twofold rise in IGF-I levels and a 75-85% decrease in plasma insulin. When IGF-I alone was given, plasma glucose fell by 30-40 mg/dl (P less than 0.005) due to a transient twofold increase (P less than 0.05) in glucose uptake; hepatic glucose production and plasma FFA levels remained unchanged. IGF-I infusion with maintenance of euglycemia produced a sustained rise in glucose uptake and a marked stimulation of [3-3H]glucose incorporation into tissue glycogen, but still failed to suppress glucose production and FFA levels. IGF-I also produced a generalized 30-40% reduction in plasma amino acids, regardless of whether or not hypoglycemia was prevented. This was associated with a decrease in leucine flux and a decline in the incorporation of [1-14C]leucine into muscle and liver protein (P less than 0.05). When insulin was infused in a dosage that mimicked the rise in glucose uptake seen with IGF-I, nearly identical changes in amino acid metabolism occurred. However, insulin suppressed glucose production by 65% and FFA levels by 40% (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, insulin was less effective than IGF-I in promoting glycogen synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin is a newly discovered, potent vasoconstrictor peptide secreted by endothelial cells. The binding of endothelin was studied on cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells obtained from umbilical veins. A single specific binding site for 125I-endothelin was identified, with an apparent Kd of 126 pM and a maximal binding capacity of approximately 10,000 sites per smooth muscle cell. At room temperature the binding was saturable, reached equilibrium at 2 h (using 20 pM endothelin), and was slowly and only partially reversed by unlabeled endothelin. The calcium antagonists nifedipine, nicardipine, and diltiazem did not compete for the same binding site. Conditioned medium from cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells inhibited the binding of 125I-endothelin dose dependently. This effect was antagonized by anti-endothelin antiserum. We conclude that human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells possess specific binding sites for endothelin, and that human endothelial cells secrete an endothelinlike material.\r"

  ".W": "In Munich-Wistar rats, a micropipette was inserted into a first-order branch of the left main renal artery and continuously infused with human/porcine endothelin (0.4 ng/min). Micropuncture measurements revealed substantial differences within the cortical microcirculation of the same left kidney: SNGFR was some 35% lower in glomeruli exposed to endothelin compared with non-endothelin-perfused glomeruli (P less than 0.005). Similarly, glomerular plasma flow rate was some 38% lower in the endothelin-exposed glomeruli (P less than 0.001). The hypoperfusion and hypofiltration in the endothelin-exposed glomeruli reflected an increase in resistances in the afferent and efferent arterioles. There was no difference in the value of the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient between the two populations of glomeruli. We also studied kidneys that underwent 25 min of renal artery clamping 48 h before study. Antiendothelin antibody infused into one of the branches of the main renal artery ameliorated the vasoconstriction characteristic of postischemic nephrons: within the cortical microcirculation, the SNGFR in glomeruli exposed to antiendothelin antibody was 27.0 +/- 3.1 nl/min as compared with 17.4 +/- 1.7 measured in glomeruli not perfused with the antibody (P less than 0.001). Similarly, glomerular plasma flow rate was higher in the glomeruli exposed to antiendothelin antibody (128.7 +/- 14.4 nl/min vs. 66.6 +/- 5.6, P less than 0.005). Resistances in both the afferent and efferent arterioles were substantially lower in the antibody-exposed glomeruli. It is, therefore, suggested that endothelin, presumably released from damaged endothelium, may play an important intermediary role in the hypoperfusion and hypofiltration observed in postischemic kidneys.\r"

  ".W": "Although not absolute, there are indications for each of the retention and resistance features described. Amalgapins and circumferential slots have their greatest indication in teeth with short clinical crowns and in cusps that have been reduced 2-3 mm for coverage with amalgam. In these situations, slots provide more resistance than amalgapins and amalgam inserts. When amalgapins or slots are used as the only retention and resistance features, the restoration is susceptible to early fracture during matrix removal. When the technical requirements for placement of vertical pins can be met, they provide excellent retention and resistance form. Vertical pins should be placed at least 0.5 mm inside the dentinoenamel junction, at a depth of approximately 2 mm, and should protrude from the tooth approximately 2 mm. However, there are inherent risks involved with pin placement; these include crazing of tooth structure, perforation into the pulp or periodontium, and weakening of the amalgam restoration over the pins. The use of both vertical and horizontal pins may be limited by inadequate access; in these cases, alternate devices should be used. When a cusp has been reduced and increased resistance is needed, a ledge or peripheral step may be indicated. It must be remembered that this feature will result in a greater display of amalgam and may be esthetically unacceptable on a facial cusp. If esthetic appearance is a factor, horizontal pins may be used to reinforce a remaining facial cusp. Horizontal pins may also be used to splint or tie a remaining cusp to the restoration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The precise manner in which these cells participate and the relative degree to which these cells contribute to, or orchestrate, events remains to be delineated. Research on the potential role of macrophages in asthma syndromes remains in its infancy. In time we will discover new roles for mononuclear phagocyte-derived mediators and many more new mediators that will play a role in the complex immunologic events ongoing in the airways of patients with asthma. Also, future research will continue to explore what promises to be a productive area of research, namely, cell-cell interactions and the manner in which many cells participate together in the pathophysiology of asthma. If macrophages can be demonstrated to influence airway inflammation associated with atopic disease, they may be appropriate targets for therapeutic intervention.\r"

Two patients reported cold, in addition to heat and exercise, as a factor inducing symptoms. Prospective exercise challenge documented a rise in in plasma histamine sixfold to 20-fold above baseline values that accompanied onset of symptoms. All four subjects had proved refractory to conventional antihistamine therapy. Institution of ketotifen at doses ranging from 3 to 8 mg per day resulted in symptomatic improvement, and in all four subjects a repeat exercise challenge confirmed clinical improvement. In three subjects exercise challenge with ketotifen demonstrated blockade of mast cell-mediator release. Plasma histamine levels remained at baseline. In the fourth patient, histamine rose to about half the peak observed before ketotifen therapy. These findings confirm the observation that ketotifen is both an H1 histamine-receptor antagonist as well as a stabilizer of mast cell-mediator release. We speculate that ketotifen may prove more effective than conventional antihistamines in the management of severe urticaria.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of nifedipine, a calcium channel antagonist, in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria, was evaluated in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Ten patients with chronic urticaria refractory to maximally tolerated doses of H1 and H2 antihistamines and in whom extensive evaluation failed to identify a cause for their urticaria were entered into the study. Patients continued with their prestudy antihistamine regimens. A study drug dosage was titrated in each patient and maintained throughout the trial. Patients were treated with placebo or nifedipine for 4 weeks and then crossed over to the other medication for 4 weeks. One patient withdrew because of unrelated medical illness, two patients withdrew after crossover to placebo because of intolerable urticaria, and seven patients completed the study. A beneficial effect of nifedipine was clearly demonstrated. Hive count, hive index, and itch index were all significantly improved at the end of 4 weeks of nifedipine treatment (p = 0.023, 0.003, and 0.003, respectively) but not placebo treatment (p = 0.194, 0.664, and 0.944, respectively). Additionally, end point hive index and itch index scores with nifedipine compared to corresponding placebo scores were significantly improved (p = 0.010 and 0.008, respectively). Nifedipine was well tolerated. Thus, when nifedipine is used as an adjunct to antihistamines, it appears to be a safe, efficacious drug for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria.\r"

Thirty-seven patients completed the study. During a 1-week run-in period with inhaled terbutaline monotherapy, the mean nocturnal asthma score was 1.0 (+/- 0.1) (corresponding to one awakening every night), and the mean overnight fall in peak expiratory flow rate was 27.7% (+/- 2.0). The patients were randomly entered into double-blind, crossover periods of 3 weeks each: (1) sustained-release terbutaline, 10 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), (2) sustained-release terbutaline, 10 mg b.i.d., and two puffs (400 micrograms) of budesonide, b.i.d., and (3) two puffs (400 micrograms) of budesonide, b.i.d. The combined treatment resulted in significantly lower overnight fall in peak expiratory flow rate (6.9% +/- 1.4 compared to 9.4% +/- 2.0 during sustained-release terbutaline and 10.4% +/- 1.9 during budesonide) and less nocturnal awakenings (nocturnal asthma score 0.15 +/- 0.05, 0.43 +/- 0.09, and 0.26 +/- 0.06, respectively) than either single treatment alone (p less than 0.05). The differences between the single treatments were not significant. We thus found that an inhaled steroid is as effective as a long-acting oral beta 2-agonist in controlling nocturnal asthma and that the combination is better. The observed differences were, however, small, and other studies would be required to evaluate the clinical significance of the present finding.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of immunotherapy on the production of histamine-releasing factor (HRF) by mononuclear cells (MNC) from patients with seasonal asthma was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Twenty-four patients with asthma were randomly divided into a placebo-treated group and a grass pollen-treated group. In vitro production of HRF by MNCs and the provocative concentration of histamine that causes 20% fall in FEV1 were measured before and after immunotherapy, and symptoms were monitored during the pollen season. MNCs from the patients were either cultured alone, spontaneous HRF production (spHRF), or in the presence of grass allergens (grass-stimulated HRF production), and the supernatants were assayed for HRF activity with basophils from a single donor after the study. We found that MNCs from patients with seasonal asthma to grass pollen spontaneously produce substantial amounts of HRF. The group of patients treated with placebo developed typical symptoms in the pollen season and also an increase in HRF production. In contrast, patients treated with grass pollen demonstrated reduced symptoms and no increase in spHRF production. A high degree of correlation between spHRF productions and symptom scores in both treated groups was noted. After 2 years of immunotherapy, allergen-stimulated HRF production decreased significantly, whereas spHRF production decreased significantly only in the patients who were clinically benefitted. The change in the provocative concentration of histamine that causes 20% fall in FEV1 during the pollen season highly correlated with the change in HRF production. The results of this study suggest that HRF might be involved in the pathogenesis of atopic asthma.\r"

In patients in remission (stage II), it is minimal. In contrast, many patients in stage V without corticosteroid treatment demonstrated a strong reactivity of IgE antibodies, indicating persisting active disease. The pattern of IgG antibodies with individual Af components resembles, in general, that of IgE antibodies; however, discrimination between different stages and between treated patients is much weaker. Our results indicate that a certain relationship between the different stages of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Af immunoprint patterns exists.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we investigate the effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) on lymphopoiesis, and demonstrate that CsA selectively abrogates the development of CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T cells (single positive cells) in the thymus. This developmental arrest results in the complete absence of mature T cells (assessed both by phenotypic and functional analyses) in the spleen of syngeneic bone marrow transplanted mice subsequently treated with CsA. In contrast to its remarkable effect on T cells, CsA had no detectable effect on B cells differentiation. In the thymus, the generation of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes was not affected by CsA treatment, and CD4-CD8- thymocytes of CsA-treated mice expressed surface markers characteristic of normal CD4-CD8- thymocytes, and exhibited normal functional activity when stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody. Thus, CsA appears to prevent the generation of mature, single positive T cells without affecting the development of immature T cells in the thymus. In addition to its immunosuppressive effect on immunocompetent cells, these results indicate a novel feature of CsA, which involves arrest of T cell differentiation, a finding that may be important for applications in clinical bone marrow transplantation.\r"

The results indicate that the cell-surface molecule(s) recognized by 515, a mAb which defines a broadly expressed family of cell-surface glycoproteins that includes lymphocyte homing receptors, exhibit a clear bimodal distribution (515lo and 515hi); 515hi cells were found exclusively on more mature B cells which already expressed high levels of CD20. Earlier, less mature B cells, identified by their expression of CD10, were uniformly 515lo. In contrast, the CD11a/LFA-1 Ag was acquired gradually over the course of B cell development. B cells which expressed high levels of CD20 expressed three to six times as much CD11a/LFA-1 as cells which expressed CD10. Interestingly, expression of the 515hi phenotype was tightly correlated with that of Leu-8, a marker previously shown to define maturational and functions subsets of B cells. These data document the coordinated regulation of multiple cell surface structures during B cell ontogeny, and demonstrate that adhesion structures necessary for proper B cell function are precisely up-regulated during B cell differentiation in man.\r"

  ".W": "Human rIL-1 alpha significantly enhanced splenic plaque-forming cells (PFC) to SRBC in vitro and in vivo. A single i.p. injection was sufficient to produce a fivefold or greater increase in the generation of PFC in a primary response. IL-1 treatment resulted in an increased production of Ag-specific PFC, both in vitro and in vivo, in combination with suboptimal doses of Ag. When IL-1 was given with a primary dose of Ag in vivo, an enhanced IgG response occurred. IL-1 enhanced in vivo carrier priming for an anti-hapten PFC response, indicating increased Th activity. Furthermore, T cells from spleens of mice treated with IL-1 provided significantly more help in both carrier (SRBC)- and hapten (TNP)- specific PFC. The enhancement of PFC by IL-1 in vitro occurred even in the presence of an excess of neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibody. These results suggest that IL-1 may enhance T cell-dependent antibody production in part by increasing Th activity, and that the mechanism of IL-1 action in increasing antibody production involves pathways in addition to the induction of IL-2 secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine IFN-beta 2/IL-6 has emerged as an important means of communication between cells--both within the immune system as well as outside it. In exploring the link between the endocrine and the immune systems, we have studied the secretion of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 by freshly explanted human endometrial stromal cells and its modulation by estrogens. Endometrial stromal cells produced IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in response to other inflammation-associated cytokines such as IL-1 alpha or beta, TNF, and IFN-gamma. This secretion was strongly inhibited by estradiol-17 beta at concentrations as low as 10(-9) M. Multiple species of stromal cell IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in the size range 23 to 30 kDa were detected using immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting procedures. The endometrial stromal cell IFN-beta 2/IL-6 species were phosphorylated and differentially glycosylated in a manner comparable to IFN-beta 2/IL-6 secreted by induced human peripheral blood monocytes or foreskin fibroblasts. However, in contrast to peripheral blood monocytes and fibroblasts, bacterial LPS did not induce IFN-beta 2/IL-6 production in endometrial stromal cells. Additionally, the IFN-beta 2/IL-6 identified in medium from IL-1 alpha-induced stromal cells is biologically active on hepatocytes. These observations, taken together with the observation that IFN-beta 2/IL-6 strongly inhibits the proliferation of human epithelial cells, suggest the possibility that stromal cell secreted IFN-beta 2/IL-6 may affect the physiology of the overlying epithelium in an hormonally modulated manner. Estrogen-regulated production of endometrial IFN-beta 2/IL-6 may participate in gender-specific systemic immunomodulation.\r"

Initial experiments showed that C3 fragments and C3-acceptor complexes were the major serum ligands which were surface iodinated by canine myeloperoxidase on serum-incubated rough and smooth isolates of S. typhimurium. In contrast, labeled C3 was not identified when the same organisms were ingested by neutrophils in the presence of 125I-Na, a situation previously shown to iodinate particulate targets via the neutrophil myeloperoxidase-halide-H2O2 system. Pretreatment of neutrophils before phagocytosis with the lipid-soluble protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), but not with other protease inhibitors (p-nitrophenylguanidinobenzoate, leupeptin, pepstatin), substantially blocked proteolysis of 125I-C3 on S. typhimurium strain RG108 during ingestion by neutrophils. Purification of neutrophil phagosomes containing S. typhimurium-bearing 125I-C3 showed that DFP but no other protease inhibitors blocked proteolysis of 125I-C3 within phagosomes. Iodinated C3-acceptor complexes were identified by immunoprecipitation from the detergent-insoluble fraction of phagosomes prepared from DFP-treated cells ingesting S. typhimurium in the presence of 125I-Na. These results show that C3 fragments on the surface of S. typhimurium are the major serum ligands which are halogenated and degraded by proteolysis during phagocytosis by human neutrophils, and suggest that the majority of proteolysis on the ingested target occurs within the neutrophil phagosome.\r"

  ".W": "The mAb 60.3 recognizes the neutrophil CD18 Ag. We have investigated the effect of in vitro pretreatment of radiolabeled neutrophils with mAb 60.3 on their accumulation in vivo. Further, we have compared the in vivo effects of mAb 60.3 with its effects on neutrophil adherence in vitro. Neutrophil accumulation in vivo was measured in response to: 1) exogenous mediators FMLP, C5a des Arg, LTB4 and IL-1; 2) endogenous mediators generated in a non-allergic inflammatory reaction induced by zymosan; and 3) endogenous mediators generated in two allergic inflammatory reactions, a passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction and a reversed passive Arthus reaction in rabbit skin. Pretreatment of neutrophils with mAb 60.3 inhibited their accumulation in all the responses. The results demonstrate that there is a common mechanism mediating neutrophil accumulation in these inflammatory reactions. Neutrophils pretreated with mAb 60.3 were also unresponsive to chemoattractants in in vitro adherence assays. However, the antibody-treated neutrophils responded normally to FMLP and C5a with respect to granular enzyme release. These results suggest that the basal expression of CD18 Ag is important for the adherence of neutrophils to microvascular endothelial cells stimulated by the local generation, or administration, of chemical mediators in vivo. Despite the fact that mediators such as FMLP can increase CD18 expression in vitro, it appears more likely that such mediators act in vivo by inducing a conformational change in the basally expressed neutrophil adhesive molecules.\r"

The secretion of lactoferrin of secondary granules and myeloperoxidase (MPO) of primary granules from single adherent human neutrophils was assayed by use of a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. Both rTNF and rGM-CSF caused secretion of lactoferrin in a dose-dependent manner. Both agents also caused secretion of MPO, but only in the presence of cytochalasin B. Preincubation with pertussis toxin inhibited rGM-CSF-induced secretion of both lactoferrin and MPO. rTNF-induced MPO secretion was also blocked by pertussis toxin, whereas lactoferrin secretion was only slightly affected. Neither rTNF nor rGM-CSF caused any detectable changes in the concentration of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ in fura-2-loaded cells. However, when neutrophils were loaded with increasing concentrations of quin-2 to buffer any local, not detectable, changes in the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+, both rTNF- and rGM-CSF-induced secretion of lactoferrin and MPO were almost totally abolished at a relatively low quin-2 concentration. These results suggest a role of a regulatory G-protein and minute local changes in the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in TNF- and GM-CSF-induced neutrophil degranulation.\r"

We examined the effect of priming PMN with GM-CSF on the production of [3H] platelet-activating factor (PAF) from [3H]acetate upon stimulation with the chemotactic factors FMLP and C5a. In PMN stimulated with the individual peptide mediators alone [3H]PAF levels were close to controls, whereas considerable amounts of [3H]PAF are formed after stimulation of PMN which have been preexposed to GM-CSF. The priming effect was concentration and time dependent. It was optimal after a preincubation period of 2 h. A maximum of [3H]PAF accumulation is reached within 2.5 min (C5a) and 5.0 min (FMLP) after activation of GM-CSF-primed PMN. In addition, we show that PAF isolated from PMN preincubated with GM-CSF and triggered with chemotactic factors is able to enhance the respiratory burst in PMN. PAF formed by sequentially activated PMN could contribute to the enhanced oxygen radical production and cytotoxicity in effector cells and play a role in modulating and amplifying inflammatory reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Natural and synthetic lipid A as well as natural and synthetic oligosaccharide partial structures of LPS were examined in dose-response experiments to define the minimal structure necessary for IL-1 induction and release in cultures of human mononuclear cells. Wild type LPS (S. abortus equi) and rough mutant LPS was active in minimal-doses of 1 to 100 pg/ml, whereas synthetic heptaacyl and hexaacyl lipid A (Salmonella minnesota and Escherichia coli lipid A, respectively) induced IL-1 in minimal-doses of 100 to 1,000 pg/ml and 10 to 1,000 pg/ml, respectively. Nanogram amounts (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) of synthetic monodephospho partial structures of E. coli lipid A were necessary for IL-1 induction. Synthetic pentaacyl partial structures induced IL-1 very weakly. Synthetic tetraacyl and bisacyl partial structures lacking non-hydroxylated fatty acids were not active. Compared to LPS million-fold higher doses of natural and synthetic 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid containing core oligosaccharides were necessary for IL-1 induction. Dose-response investigations with LPS and natural or synthetic partial structures established the following hierarchy in IL-1 induction-capacity: LPS greater than lipid A much greater than lipid A partial structures greater than core oligosaccharides greater than oligoacyl lipid A. Lipid A was shown here to be the portion of LPS mainly responsible for induction of IL-1 activity. The high potency of lipid A in inducing IL-1 release and the failure of the precursor Ia of lipid A to induce IL-1 production and release was also observed measuring intracellular IL-1 activity after freeze-thawing the cells. Levels of IL-1 beta mRNA in extracts of mononuclear cells correlated with biologic activity. In co-incubation experiments, precursor Ia of lipid A produced dose-dependent inhibition of production and release of IL-1 activity induced by lipid A or LPS, but not by Staphylococcus epidermidis or PHA. Incubation of cells with precursor Ia for 1h, followed by a medium change and further incubation of stimulus without precursor Ia of lipid A also resulted in inhibition. We conclude that lipid A is the main portion of LPS responsible for induction of IL-1, and that specific activation- and/or binding-mechanisms are involved in stimulation of cells with LPS and/or lipid A.\r"

The pretreatment HSV-2-LP of subjects was low compared with that of controls with infrequently recurring genital HSV-2 (54,000 vs. 110,000 cpm). The HSV-2-LP increased with both S-ACV and PLC/ACV (101,000 and 94,000 cpm, respectively). After treatment was stopped, the HSV-2-LP decreased in both groups (59,000 cpm). Similar data were seen in a subpopulation given a second year of S-ACV. HSV recurrences were reduced in the S-ACV but not in the PLC/ACV group. These data suggest that a low HSV-2-LP in untreated patients is associated with frequent recurrences of genital HSV; a reduction of viral antigens by suppression with ACV or early treatment of HSV recurrences augments the HSV-2-LP response; and the recurrence pattern is not modulated by the HSV-2-LP response.\r"

As little as 50 ng of purified LPS or lipid A stimulated macrophages to produce TNF detectable as cytotoxic activity in an L-929 fibroblast assay. None of 13 MAbs (concentration range, 0.1-1,000 micrograms/mL) blocked LPS- or lipid A (0.025-0.1 micrograms/mL)-induced TNF secretion by RAW 264.7 cells. Rabbit antiserum to synthetic lipid A also failed to block lipid A-induced TNF activity. Similar negative results were obtained when intact bacteria or membrane vesicles were used as TNF inducers. In contrast, polymyxin B, but not the less hydrophobic polymyxin B nonapeptide, produced almost complete inhibition of macrophage TNF secretion induced by LPS, lipid A, membrane vesicles, and intact bacteria. Thus, antibody reactivity with predominantly hydrophilic elements of LPS or lipid A may not affect hydrophobic interactions between lipid A and target cell membranes necessary and sufficient for the induction of TNF. These findings raise doubts concerning the existence of true endotoxin-neutralizing antibodies.\r"

The number of high affinity, but not low affinity, sites present on the clones correlated with their sensitivity to toxin. Tunicamycin-treated CCL-2 cells became resistant to Shiga toxin in parallel with a reduction in the capacity of the high-affinity site. Cell content of Gb3, the glycolipid receptor for Shiga toxin, decreased as the sensitivity of the cells diminished. These data show that a minority of Shiga toxin binding sites of HeLa cells are involved in the cytotoxic response and suggest that Gb3 is the high-affinity functional cytotoxin receptor.\r"

All the animals given PAA, either alone or with gentamicin, developed prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles in the cells of the renal proximal convoluted tubules; the vacuoles in rats given just PAA differed from those observed in rats given PAA plus gentamicin. Rats given PAA plus gentamicin accumulated roughly 10 times more renal aminoglycoside as did rats given gentamicin alone. Immunohistochemical localization studies confirmed the presence of increased amounts of gentamicin in the cytoplasm of the tubular cells of animals given gentamicin plus PAA. PAA did not alter the in vitro antimicrobial activity of gentamicin versus Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies demonstrate the ability of PAA to prevent experimental gentamicin nephrotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "In experimental Escherichia coli pyelonephritis, the bacterial multiplication in the kidney parenchyma triggers a burst of neutrophil extravascular migration, as measured by the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the kidney, a marker for tissue neutrophil infiltration. To test the mechanisms of in vivo neutrophil migration, pyelonephritis was surgically induced in rats that were then either complement-depleted with cobra venom factor (CVF), resulting in a profound hypocomplementemia for 72 h after inoculation, or treated with phenylbutazone (PB), a competitive antagonist of bacterial chemotactic formylpeptides. Compared to controls, CVF- and PB-treated animals killed when the neutrophil infiltration started (32 h) had a significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration, as measured by kidney MPO activity. This effect disappeared in animals killed 72 h after surgery, when neutrophil infiltration peaked. These data suggest that redundant chemotactic mechanisms triggered neutrophil migration. Inhibiting one of these mechanisms only transiently delayed neutrophil migration but did not affect the peak infiltration.\r"

The inhibitory and stimulatory effects are nonspecific and may be detected using cultured human or murine tumor cell lines. Using such a bioassay, we previously tested fetal cord serum-supplemented culture supernatant and found that an absence of suppression was correlated with an absence of subsequent pregnancy. To test this association further, additional samples were obtained from four different in vitro fertilization (IVF) units and studied blindly without knowledge of the pregnancy outcome. In this series, samples were obtained after the first 12-24 hr of sperm-oocyte incubation and all of the supernatants were from individual embryo cultures. The average number of preembryos transferred to those achieving pregnancy did not differ significantly from the number transferred to those not achieving pregnancy but the level of suppression was greater (8.7 +/- 1.9%) in those becoming pregnant compared to those not achieving pregnancy (0.8 +/- 1.5%). Twenty-two of 61 patients who received at least one embryo with a suppressive supernatant achieved pregnancy, whereas 0 of 19 patients received embryos lacking suppressive supernatants became pregnant. Two patients who received a single embryo from cultures with suppression became pregnant. Several problems with the bioassay method were defined. The culture medium in this series was always supplemented with adult serum, usually from the patient herself, and this serum could be suppressive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Numerous recent studies have divided schizophrenic patients into subgroups based on a predominance of positive or negative symptoms. These works often assume that these symptoms are distributed discontinuously or inversely. In the present work, we sought relationships between positive and negative schizophrenic symptoms in a medication-free inpatient population of schizophrenic patients (N = 61). Measures of positive and negative symptoms were derived from clinical ratings using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. No correlations were found between positive and negative symptoms in the entire group, or in subgroups defined by duration of illness or diagnostic subtype. Furthermore, no correlations were found between positive or negative symptoms and age, age at onset of illness, or duration of illness. These data suggest that positive and negative symptoms vary independently among patients; knowledge about the level of positive symptoms provides no predictive information about negative symptoms. In addition, the distribution of patients showed that a large percentage have a mixture of positive and negative symptoms. Accordingly, methodologies that form restrictive subgroups of patients with exclusively positive or negative symptoms may have little generalizability to schizophrenic populations. The results suggest that schizophrenic patients should not be routinely subtyped as predominantly positive or negative.\r"

Data from week 4 showed that all eight men and seven of the women responded well to nomifensine, showing a significant decrease in ADD with hyperactivity symptoms. Side effects were minimal, consisting of drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, and nausea. One responder (5%) was taken off the medicine after developing an allergic reaction. Results showed that short-term use of nomifensine was relatively free from side effects and was remarkably effective in the treatment of ADD-RT.

In this paper, we present an algebraic model of bias in treatment trials for smoking. Bias is expressed in terms of the deception rate among continued smokers in a control group, the relative deception rate among continued smokers in an experimental group, and the sensitivity and specificity of a biochemical test which may be used either to confirm self-reports of quitting or to replace self-report entirely. For given test specificity and sensitivity, the model defines deception rates for which different biochemical testing strategies are preferred. The model is presented in the context of current knowledge on the phenomenon of deception among adult smokers. The paper concludes that better judgements regarding the role of biochemical tests in treatment trials for smoking require more precise information regarding the magnitude and determinants of deception.\r"

Studies were examined for the stated purpose and scope of the dietary instrument, for a description of the instrument itself, for any methods employed to train individuals in its use and for the methods used to assess its reliability and validity. Of the 59 studies reviewed, 54% described fully the dietary method used. Of the 39 studies that described the results using questionnaires, 51% gave specific information on questions asked and only 18% included the questionnaire itself. Reliability was assessed in 26 studies and 74% (19) used the test-retest reliability and 22% (6) used proxies to assess reliability. Validity was assessed in 46 studies and 83% (38) used indirect methods that compared the results of one dietary method (e.g. 24 hr recall) with another more extensive one (e.g. diet history). Thirty five percent (16) used biochemical and 15% (7) used other methods. This review suggests several directions that might be usefully followed in conducting and reporting further research in the development of methods to assess diet.\r"

The median survival of patients initially randomized to receive mitoxantrone was 273 days; for doxorubicin 268 days (P = .40). There were three responses among 77 patients crossed over to mitoxantrone after initial treatment with doxorubicin. The major dose-limiting toxicity for both drugs was leukopenia. There was significantly less severe and less frequent toxicity with mitoxantrone administration. Severe nausea and vomiting occurred in 9.5% of mitoxantrone patients and 25.3% of doxorubicin patients (P less than .001). The incidence of severe stomatitis and mucositis was 0.6% in the mitoxantrone group and 8.4% in the doxorubicin group (P = .001). Severe alopecia occurred in 5.1% of mitoxantrone patients and 61.0% of doxorubicin patients (P less than .001). A life-table comparison of the cumulative dose to the development of a cardiac event showed that mitoxantrone had significantly less cardiotoxicity than doxorubicin (P = .0005). This study demonstrates that mitoxantrone is active as a single agent in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Compared with doxorubicin it appears to be marginally less active and significantly less toxic. We conclude that mitoxantrone can be used alone or with other standard drugs to palliate the symptoms of metastatic breast cancer, especially in settings where drug toxicity is an important consideration.\r"

  ".W": "Despite numerous reports of findings obtained following the use of doxorubicin (Adriamycin [A]; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) for the postoperative treatment of patients with primary breast cancer and positive axillary nodes, no clear consensus exists regarding its worth when used in that setting. In June 1981, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) implemented two randomized clinical trials aimed at evaluating the worth of doxorubicin when administered in conjunction with melphalan (L-PAM) and fluorouracil (5-FU) (PF). A prior NSABP study identified cohorts of patients who did or did not benefit from tamoxifen (TAM, T) when used with chemotherapy. That information was employed in the design of the present studies. Women considered responsive to TAM (1,106) were randomized between PFT and PAFT, and those nonresponsive to TAM (707) were randomized between PF and PAF. Findings through 6 years of follow-up (mean duration of potential time on study, 64 months and 63 months, respectively) indicate that non-TAM-responsive patients who received PAF had a significantly better disease-free survival (DFS) (P = .003) and survival (P = .05) than did those receiving PF. By contrast, there was no significant difference in DFS (P = .6) or survival (P = .7) between PFT- and PAFT-treated patients. No disparity in the amount of drug received, whether related to the median amount or to dose-intensity, is present to account for the difference in findings between the studies. Aside from alopecia and emesis, the toxicity from the doxorubicin-containing regimens was similar to those in which doxorubicin was omitted. Cardiomyopathy was not a significant finding; there were no deaths from cardiac toxicity. The incidence of arterial and venous complications in patients receiving TAM was less than reported by others.\r"

The majority of patients had disseminated lymphoma at the time of diagnosis; 14 patients (26%) presented with Ann Arbor stage I and II disease. Five- and 10-year survival for all patients was 76% and 49%. The only clinicopathologic features identified that predicted a shortened survival were the presence or absence of systemic (B) symptoms (15% v 63% at 10 years, P = .01) and a diffuse rather than pseudofollicular nodal architecture (47% v 87% at 10 years, P = .04). Initial bone marrow involvement was not an adverse prognostic factor for patients who presented with stage III and IV disease. Ten patients developed a marked lymphocytosis consistent with progression to a leukemic phase (chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]). These ten patients had a median initial lymphocyte count of 2,790, compared with 1,580 for those patients who did not progress to CLL (P = .0001). Developing CLL did not adversely affect survival (P = .48). Thirty-seven patients were treated with various combinations of radiation and chemotherapy; 17 patients received no initial therapy. Ten-year freedom from relapse (FFR) for stage I and II patients treated with irradiation was 80% and 62%; FFR for stage III and IV treated patients was 11%. Despite the marked differences in FFR, no statistically significant difference in survival could be demonstrated between the various stages. Selected patients with advanced SL received no initial therapy; these patients had a 10-year survival that was not statistically different from the immediately treated stage III and IV patients. Patients with stage I and II SL should be treated with irradiation; prolonged FFR and possibly cure of the disease can be achieved in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and hematologic effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating (GM-CSF) were studied in a phase I/II trial of 16 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The GM-CSF was administered subcutaneously (SC) daily so as to achieve prolonged blood levels and to establish an outpatient treatment regimen. Four dose levels were administered for ten days: 0.3 microgram/kg/d (three patients), 1.0 microgram/kg/d (three), 3.0 micrograms/kg/d (four), and 10.0 micrograms/kg/d (six). The most common toxicities were fever and a flu-like syndrome, which were dose-dependent. The maximum-tolerated dose was 10.0 micrograms/kg/d, which induced severe rigors (two patients), fever greater than 40 degrees C (one), severe bronchospasm (one), and WBC 60,000 (one). In one patient, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) progressed to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia after two doses of GM-CSF, and the patient died of leukemia that did not respond to chemotherapy. After doses of 3.0 and 10.0 micrograms/kg, serum GM-CSF levels peaked at 3.8 to 6.3 hours, and persisted for 14 and 24 hours, respectively. Circulating granulocytes (neutrophils and bands) increased in a dose-dependent manner, as 11 of 13 patients who received greater than or equal to 1.0 microgram/kg/d responded with a two- to 194-fold increase. Although the neutrophils usually returned to pretreatment levels shortly after stopping GM-CSF, two patients continue to exhibit an elevation of neutrophils for 6 months. Dose-related increases in circulating monocytes and eosinophils were also noted. Transient increases in platelet and reticulocyte counts were observed in two and three patients, respectively. Five of the 16 patients later received maintenance GM-CSF at 3 micrograms/kg/d for 2 to 9 weeks. All showed a dramatic increase in neutrophils after 2 weeks. Thereafter, despite continued therapy, the neutrophil count in four patients declined markedly. In conclusion, GM-CSF is well tolerated by the SC route and induces striking, but usually temporary, improvement in the neutropenia of MDS. Larger prospective phase III trials will determine the duration of hematologic responses and the impact on infection, morbidity, and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics of 367 stage I-IV National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS) children who relapsed after initial treatment for unilateral disease in the second and third NWTS trials (NWTS-2 and -3) were analyzed to identify features predictive of survival. Although modifications in initial therapy resulted in a lower rate of first relapse in these two studies compared with NWTS-1, all previously identified prognostic factors after relapse remained statistically significant predictors of survival. Tumor histology, length of initial remission, initial therapy with two v three drugs, and site of relapse each were independently predictive of postrelapse survival. The 3-year postrelapse survival for all 367 patients was 30% +/- 3%; however, subgroups classified by these prognostic factors were identified that had 3-year postrelapse survival rates of greater than 40%. These subgroups included patients who had tumors of favorable histology (FH) that recurred (1) only in the lungs, (2) in the abdomen when radiotherapy (RT) was not initially given, or (3) that were originally stage I, (4) that were originally treated with only two drugs, or (5) that recurred 12 months or more after diagnosis. These results were achieved with the use of standard treatments, ie, surgery, RT, and chemotherapy using dactinomycin (AMD), vincristine (VCR), and Adriamycin [( ADR] doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH). It is suggested that patients in these groups might be managed with aggressive use of conventional therapies until newer chemotherapeutic agents and drug combinations are shown to be more effective. Patients with adverse prognostic features at relapse have a poor survival expectancy with standard measures. Salvage attempts for these patients are better based on experimental approaches.\r"

  ".W": "In order to avoid the difficulties in scheduling and cost involved in admitting patients to hospital to undergo bone marrow harvests, we assessed outpatient marrow harvesting for autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) candidates. Over a 13-month period, 39 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies underwent bone marrow harvests as outpatients. For comparison we also evaluated 20 consecutive patients with similar disease status who had undergone bone marrow harvests as inpatients over the preceding 6 months. The mean hemoglobin value prior to harvest the mean volume of marrow harvested, and the mean nucleated cell count in the outpatient group were not significantly different from those of the inpatient group. There were no intraoperative complications. Of these 39 patients, 36 were discharged later the same day on oral iron supplements, with no adverse sequelae. Local pain was well controlled at home with mild oral analgesics. Two patients required admission due to postoperative hypotension--both responded promptly to intravenous (IV) fluids and blood and were discharged the following day. One patient was admitted postoperatively due to fever. There was a trend for the outpatients to receive less intra- and postoperative blood transfusions, but this did not reach statistical significance. The results suggest that most candidates for autologous BMT can safely undergo bone marrow harvesting as outpatients, thereby relieving pressure for hospital beds, potentially reducing costs and improving bed utilization. The study also raises the possibility of safely performing outpatient harvests on allogeneic BMT donors.\r"

Doses were escalated from 375 to 2,400 mg/m2; autologous bone marrow reinfusion was added to the regimen at doses of 1,600 mg/m2 and above. The MTD was determined to be 2,000 mg/m2. Dose-limiting toxicity consisting of reversible hepatotoxicity, renal dysfunction, and moderate to severe ototoxicity was observed with a dose of 2,400 mg/m2. There were ten responses in 31 heavily pretreated patients, including six responses in 11 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a systemic clearance (Clss) of 4.5 L/m2/h. This value is consistent with clearances reported for carboplatin administered at lower doses and by different schedules. No evidence for saturation of systemic clearance at higher doses was observed. Carboplatin appears to be an active drug that can undergo considerable dose escalation when used in conjunction with autologous bone marrow support.\r"

The majority (94%) of published cases of tripe palms occurred in patients with cancer; only five patients showed no evidence of an associated malignancy. Tripe palms were frequently seen in conjunction with acanthosis nigricans (77% of cases), although they can occur alone (23% of cases). In cancer patients with tripe palms alone, the most common underlying neoplasm was pulmonary carcinoma (53% of cases), whereas patients with both tripe palms and acanthosis nigricans frequently had gastric (35% of cases) or pulmonary (11% of cases) carcinomas. A wide variety of other solid tumors have also been observed. Importantly, in over 40% of patients, tripe palms were the presenting feature of a previously undiagnosed malignancy. Therefore, all patients with tripe palms should be evaluated with a full diagnostic work-up for an associated malignancy, particularly lung or gastric carcinoma.\r"

The overall mortality rate at 6 months was 42%: 10 (38%) of the 26 patients in the conservative group and 12 (46%) of the 26 in the surgical group. Six (20%) of the 30 survivors at 6 months were able to conduct their activities of daily living independently: five (31%) of the 16 patients in the conservative group and one (7%) of the 14 in the operative group. These differences are not statistically significant. The mortality rate of semicomatose or stuporous patients (Glasgow Coma Scale score 7 to 10) was statistically significantly lower in the surgical group (none of the four patients) than in the conservative group (four of five patients) (p less than 0.05); however, all surviving patients in this subgroup were severely disabled. The study suggests that surgical treatment of this category of patients with ICH does not offer any definite advantage over conservative treatment. In semicomatose or stuporous patients, surgery may improve the length of survival, but the quality of life remains poor.\r"

Studies have demonstrated that dexamethasone is radioprotective in a number of cell lines. The C6 astrocytoma cell line is well established in vitro and is modulated by dexamethasone treatment. It has therefore been hypothesized that dexamethasone-treated C6 astrocytoma cells would be more resistant to radiation-induced damage. The present study was carried out to assess this hypothesis using both the in vitro C6 astrocytoma monolayer and three-dimensional multicellular spheroid models. Dexamethasone was inhibitory to the C6 astrocytoma cells in the monolayer preparation, increasing their doubling time by 13%. In the spheroid cultures, dexamethasone treatment decreased the number of cells per spheroid by 46%. Dexamethasone did not affect the plating efficiency of either the cells from the monolayer experiment or those dissociated from spheroids, however, suggesting that the inhibitory effect was not tumoricidal. At a clinical concentration (1.94 x 10(-5) M), dexamethasone did not significantly influence plating efficiency of irradiated C6 astrocytoma cells in monolayer or three-dimensional spheroid cultures.\r"

The first autonomous specialty board was incorporated in 1924, and over the next few decades the board system became the accepted system for credentialing specialists. In 1936 the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) became the twelfth specialty board. It was intended to recognize only a few outstanding internists, for the ABIM's founders believed that general practitioners should continue to deliver the vast majority of care. However, World War II greatly increased the importance of the ABIM and of the specialty boards system. The army medical services emphasized the importance of board certification, thus encouraging physicians to receive residency training and to sit for a specialty board. After the war, the expanding VA hospital system provided them a place to do so. Specialty training and board certification became the norm, not the exception. Also, the national exigencies of World War II forced Congress to devise a new system to distribute federal funds for biomedical research to universities. That system, continued as the National Institutes of Health, supported the subsequent growth of internal medicine in general, as well as its subspecialties. Both the ABIM and the other specialty boards were formed at a particular time and place in response to the specific interests of individuals and organizations, and their histories reflect both the ideals of their founders and the long-term structural effects of war.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the choice among alternatives quantitatively, a formal decision model must be developed. Yet the literature does not currently include the information required to develop this model. Data tell us very little about what factors should be considered in the choice of treatment for NIDDM patients. Table 1 summarizes some of the advantages and disadvantages of insulin, sulfonylureas, and dietary treatments. Insulin may have the greatest effect upon blood glucose, but may also be associated with the greatest likelihood of nuisance for the patient. At the other extreme, dietary treatment may be safe, but may have a low probability of achieving long-term blood glucose control. There is remarkably little in the literature that considers nuisance factors for the patient, minor but persistent side effects, or the likelihood of other physical changes such as weight gain. We know even less about how to integrate preferences for benefits and side effects into a comprehensive decision. Although some profiles of laboratory results clearly dictate a treatment protocol, there is considerable variability in the treatment options for a large number of NIDDM patients. Consider, for example, the patient who has a fasting blood glucose of 250 mg/dl but no symptoms. There may be several treatment alternatives. Yet the chances of therapeutic success could be influenced by the patient's concern about being dependent upon medication, willingness to comply with life-style changes, and fear of using needles. We suggest that the patient must be active in negotiating the choice of treatment, and that patient preferences for expected outcomes, side effects, and nuisance factors need to be considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In reference to an audiometric gold standard (40-dB HL hearing loss in speech frequencies), 512-Hz and 1024-Hz tuning forks, finger rub, and whispered voice tests performed well (ROC curve areas = 0.82 to 0.94). Simultaneously high (greater than 0.80) sensitivities and specificities were achievable for all these tests in demented patients. In non-demented patients, however, only the whispered voice test achieved simultaneously high specificity and sensitivity. The most accurate rule for air conduction screening audiometry was the inability to hear greater than or equal to two of four 40-dB HL speech frequencies (sensitivity = 1.0, specificity = 0.75 in non-demented patients; sensitivity = 0.97, specificity = 0.74 in demented patients). Interobserver/test-retest reliability was generally high for tuning forks, finger rub, and whispered voice tests (range of intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.38 to 0.90), and was somewhat higher in demented than in non-demented patients. These results suggest that some of the simple, traditional methods of auditory screening may have considerable validity and reliability in demented and non-demented older adults.\r"

Almost half (49%) of diabetic patients in a combined university clinic and private practice reused supposedly disposable insulin syringes a mean of 3.9 times. Compliance with standard aseptic precautions was poor, with only 29% of patients following recommended practices. No adverse effect of syringe reuse was identified. The authors conclude that diabetic patients frequently reuse disposable syringes, without apparent harmful effect.\r"

The follow-up period for 185 patients was 5 years or more, and 55 were followed 10 years or more. Removable dentures were made for 350 patients, and fixed bridges for 18 patients. Forty-three patients had reversible complications, one patient had unilateral hypesthesia, and six patients had their implant removed. Reversible complications of infection, gingival hyperplasia, loading of individual posts, and fenestration of threads were controlled without deleterious effects on the gingival, mucosal, or osseous tissues. The transmandibular implant system was shown to successfully restore function of the severely atrophic mandible in a more predictable manner than augmentation procedures.\r"

To probe the involvement of endogenous adenosine in the control of renin release, we examined the effects of an adenosine receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-(p-sulfophenyl)xanthine (DPSPX), on renin release in rats fed either a normal or low sodium diet. All studies were conducted in the in situ autoperfused kidney. DPSPX significantly increased arterial and renal venous levels of renin in both groups of animals; however, statistical analysis of the data (2-factor analysis of variance) indicated that DPSPX increased aortic and renal venous levels of renin more in rats fed a low sodium diet compared to rats fed a normal sodium diet. Also, whereas DPSPX did not significantly increase the venoarterial difference of renin activity across the kidney or the calculated net secretion rate of renin in rats on a normal sodium diet, both of these indices of renin release were significantly increased by DPSPX in rats on a low sodium diet. The effects of DPSPX on renin release could not be explained by changes in renal hemodynamics or excretory function. Additional experiments with rats on a low sodium diet that were treated with propranolol demonstrated that the effects of DPSPX on renin release were independent of the sympathetic nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the mechanisms by which kainic acid (KA) produces increases in [Ca++]i in single striatal neurons in vitro using fura-2-based microfluorimetry. When neurons were depolarized by perfusion with high K+ or veratridine containing solutions, [Ca++]i rose rapidly to a peak and then declined to a lower sustained plateau that persisted as long as the depolarizing stimulus. The peak high K+-induced rise in [Ca++]i occurred at [K+]o greater than 50 mM and the plateau was largest at 30 mM K+. [K+]o that was greater than 70 mM caused the magnitude of the plateau to decrease. Responses to high K+ stimulation were completely dependent on [Ca++]o and presumably represented Ca++ influx. Nitrendipine partially blocked the peak of the high K+-induced response and completely blocked the sustained plateau Ca++ influx. The nitrendipine-resistant portion of the high K+ response could be completely blocked by predepolarization of the cell in Ca++-free solution. KA also produced large increases in [Ca++]i that were abolished on removal of external Ca++. Predepolarization/nitrendipine greatly reduced the effect of lower [KA] (100 microM). However, KA-induced increases in [Ca++]i became increasingly resistant to block of voltage-sensitive Ca++ channels as [KA] rose above 100 microM, indicating a second route of Ca++ entry that may be the KA receptor-gated ionophore. About one-half the responses to KA (100 microM) also displayed a large oscillation. [Ca++]i rose to a peak, fell and then rose again before finally declining to a plateau level. This oscillation was abolished when all external Na+ was replaced by Li+ and may result from alterations in the buffering of [Ca++]i as a result of KA-induced Na+ influx.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine the extent, pathways and effects of absorption promoters on the systemic absorption of insulin after topical solution instillation to the albino rabbit eye. The absorption promoters were polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, Na glycocholate (GC), Na taurocholate and Na deoxycholate, all at a concentration of 1%. Plasma glucose concentration was measured in a glucose analyzer whereas plasma insulin concentration was measured using radioimmunoassay. The systemic bioavailability of insulin calculated from its area under concentration-time curve was in good agreement with that derived from the glucose concentration-time curve. The bioavailability was 5.7 to 12.6% with polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, 4.9 to 7.9% with GC, 3.6 to 7.8% with Na taurocholate and 8.2 to 8.3% with Na deoxycholate, as compared to 0.7 to 1.3% in the absence of absorption promoters. The absorption promoting effect of GC was dependent on its concentration over the range of 0.1 to 2%. At 1%, the absorption promoting effect of GC persisted for about 5 min but disappeared by 15 to 30 min. The nasal mucosa contributed about 4 times more than the conjunctival mucosa to the systemic absorption of ocularly applied insulin. The conjunctival mucosa was, however, more discriminant in its sensitivity to the nature of the bile salts than the nasal mucosa. The former was most sensitive to Na deoxycholate and least to Na taurocholate. Collectively, our findings indicate that it is feasible to obtain hypoglycemia from ocularly administered insulin.\r"

The drug reached maximal concentrations in plasma and brain within 10 to 30 min of injection (2 mg/kg) with an elimination half-life of 1.9 and 2.05 hr, respectively. Mean ratio of brain area concentration-time curve to plasma area concentration time curve was 12.5, referring to total plasma concentrations. MK-801 distributed almost equally between plasma and red cells (mean blood-to-plasma ratio averaged 1.2 +/- 0.2 when calculated 30 and 180 min from drug administration). Plasma and brain concentrations of MK-801 rose almost linearly from 0.5 to 4 mg/kg 30 min after injection and the brain-to-plasma ratio (12.9 +/- 2.8) was constant in the dose range studied. The distribution of the drug in various brain regions 30 and 180 min after 2 mg/kg i.p. showed no preferential concentration or retention in any of the areas studied.

This method accurately quantitates the intensity of staining and the percentage of cells from freshly derived primary tumors expressing the relevant cell surface antigens. This method was applied to human colorectal, gastric, and ovarian carcinomas. It allowed calculations of the number of drug molecules that potentially could be delivered by each MAb as well as selection of the optimal combinations of antibodies for treatment of each type of cancer. The binding of all the MAbs varied among the tumors, although combinations of antibodies reduced this problem. A combination of MAbs C14 and NCRC-23 recognized 97% of colorectal tumors. A combination of C14, NCRC-23, and 791T/36 recognized 95% of gastric tumors. Combinations of either 791T/36 and C14 or 791T/36 and NCRC-11 recognized 80% of ovarian tumors. The number of cells binding with a single MAb varied within the tumor. The optimal anti-colorectal tumor antibody was NCRC-23 (anti-carcinoembryonic antigen), which recognized a mean of 65% of the large cells within a tumor at a mean antigen density of 4.9 X 10(5) sites/cell. The optimal anti-gastric tumor antibody was C14 (anti-Y hapten), which recognized a mean of 66% of the large cells within a tumor at a mean antigen density of 4.4 X 10(5) sites/cell. The optimal anti-ovarian antibody was 115/D8, which recognized 54% of the large cells at a mean antigen density of 4.2 X 10(5) sites/cell. These antigen densities were similar to those calculated for HLA/ABC antigens in colorectal and ovarian cancers. However, the gastric tumors expressed elevated levels of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens, with a mean density of 7.3 X 10(5) sites/cell. Combinations of antibodies that recognize a high proportion of tumor cells are likely to be necessary for MAb-drug targeting to prevent tumor recurrence and/or metastases.\r"

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of Dimac-SSD on the microbiology of the burn wounds and to quantitate its clinical safety and efficacy. A total of 197 patients were evaluated. Eight (4%) of these patients did not complete the study. Six patients withdrew because of local discomfort caused by the Dimac-SSD and two patients were terminated because of technical problems. The mean +/- SD duration of treatment with Dimac-SSD was 12 +/- 8.5 days, during which time the mean number of dressing changes was 2.9 per patient. During treatment with Dimac-SSD, the burn wound bacterial flora remained stable and overgrowth with Pseudomonas species or Gram-negative bacilli did not occur. Only four (2%) patients developed clinical infections; thus the Dimac-SSD appeared to have good antimicrobial effectiveness. This dressing was not associated with any organ system or metabolic side-effects and patient discomfort during application and removal was minimal. Thus this new delivery system for silver sulfadiazine was associated with excellent wound healing, a low incidence of wound infections, reduced frequency for dressing changes, and excellent patient compliance.\r"

First, intervening at the marital/family level with nonalcoholic family members can motivate an initial commitment to change in the alcoholic who is unwilling to seek help. Second, MFT alone, or with individual alcoholism treatment, produces better marital and/or drinking outcomes during the 6 months following treatment entry than methods that don't involve the spouse or other family members. The most promising MFT approach is behavioral marital therapy (BMT) that combines a focus on the drinking with work on other marital relationship issues via direct instigation of positive couple/family activities and teaching of communication and conflict resolution skills. Two BMT alcohol-focused methods have been used: a behavioral contract between alcoholic and spouse to maintain disulfiram ingestion; and \"Alcohol-Focused Spouse Involvement,\" which rearranges reinforcement contingencies to decrease family behaviors that trigger or enable drinking and to increase positive reinforcement for sobriety. Third, studies of long-term maintenance suggest that BMT with an alcohol and relationship focus may reduce marital and/or drinking deterioration better than individual methods during long-term recovery. The following recommendations were made when to intervene at the level of the individual alcoholic only, at the marital/family level, or at both the individual and marital/family levels: (a) Intervene only at the individual level when the alcoholic refuses consent to contact family members or the family refuses involvement. (b) Include adult family members who live with the alcoholic in the assessment process for all who consent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Systematic evaluation has been hampered by the unique role of hypnosis as a cultural artifact, by problems in defining and verifying hypnotic intervention, by individual and situational variation in hypnotizability, and by difficulty in separating hypnosis from the therapies to which it is applied. Clinicians using hypnosis are likely to continue to base their claims for its effectiveness on intuition, especially since no study has demonstrated that hypnotherapy is contraindicated for patients requesting its use.\r"

Early graft function was excellent as determined by urinary output in the first 20 hours postoperatively (mean 6,442 cc) and low nadir serum creatinine (mean 1.57 mg. per dl.). Acute tubular necrosis or urinary fistula developed in 3 kidneys (2.6 per cent). In the entire series, only 1 graft (0.8 per cent) was lost to technical complications. We conclude that an extraperitoneal flank approach to live donor nephrectomy is safe for the donor, and provides a structurally and functionally sound allograft for the recipient.\r"

The average volume increase in 23 patients with venous insufficiency was greater than that in 20 patients with primary arterial insufficiency (p less than 0.033). Eleven patients who had erections satisfactory for vaginal penetration after papaverine injection had a statistically greater increase in penile length but no difference in volume increase than those with a poor response. The 10 MHz. high resolution sonogram provides the most accurate assessment of penile volume, which if measured at specific intervals after papaverine injection should allow an accurate assessment of penile flow. Patients with venous insufficiency may have weakness of the tunica, allowing greater volume expansion. A satisfactory erection is not associated with a significant increase in volume.\r"

The median followup was 21 months (4 to 89 months). All patients received androgen deprivation therapy when metastases were identified. This multivariate analysis demonstrated that the pretreatment serum testosterone was the most significant variable (p less than 0.01) associated with interval until progression and the extent of bone metastases observed on the bone scan was the second most important variable (p less than 0.05). Age, race and prostatic acid phosphatase were not significantly correlated with the interval free of progression. Performance status was significantly correlated but it was nonsignificant in the multivariate analysis if the model already included testosterone level and extent of metastasis. Patients with a pretreatment testosterone level of less than 300 ng. per 100 ml. and more than 6 areas of increased uptake on the bone scan had the most rapid progression. We conclude that serum testosterone and extent of bone metastases are the most important of the analyzed factors in terms of interval to progression in patients with prostate cancer following androgen deprivation.\r"

A segment of the inferior vena cava should be harvested with the right but not necessarily with the left kidney. The use of a long segment of vena cava makes the renal transplantation much easier and does not interfere with multiorgan procurement. The method is most useful when the right renal vein is extremely short or when the recipient has a large abdomen and a deep pelvis.\r"

This syndrome, which some have suggested should be expanded to include patients with nephropathy, Wilms tumor and any abnormality of gonadal differentiation, appears early in life. The first sign usually is genital ambiguity. However, proteinuria, hematuria and hypertension eventually require renal biopsy, which may reveal a variety of glomerular and interstitial changes. The nephropathy progresses rapidly, is unresponsive to steroids and eventually requires dialysis. Wilms tumor may appear as a mass on ultrasound or it may not be recognized until nephrectomy or even autopsy. Young children with gonadal dysgenesis and nephropathy are at high risk for nephroblastoma and gonadal tumors and, therefore, prophylactic nephrectomy and gonadectomy should be considered early in the course of this disease.\r"

Because most Doppler instruments measure the maximum peak frequency and the extent of spectral broadening, observations in the flow model included changes in the center-line maximum velocity and the location and intensity of flow disturbances. The results showed that center-line measurements of maximum velocity (equivalent to peak Doppler frequency) were directly related to the severity of the stenosis as long as the recordings were made from within the throat to about 1.5 to 3 tube diameters downstream, depending on the shape of the stenosis. However, flow disturbances (equivalent to spectral broadening) did not always occur in the center line of the vessel. Stenoses greater than 50% area reduction produced turbulence across the entire vessel in the region 4.5 to 7.5 diameters downstream. The turbulent period started just before peak systole and extended to just less than half the pulse cycle. In the more proximal zone a forward flow jet was present in the central part of the vessel, and reverse flow was present in the outer region. The interfacial layer between these two regions is subjected to high shear rates that resulted in the formation of waves and vortices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fifty patients who had carotid bifurcation endarterectomy as their sole surgical procedure underwent intraoperative completion angiography by means of portable intraarterial digital subtraction angiography. All had subsequent intravenous digital subtraction angiography or duplex scanning during early follow-up. After the endarterectomy site was closed and before the wound was closed, 6 to 8 ml of contrast was injected through a 21-gauge needle while fluoroscopy was performed with a conventional C-arm. The C-arm was coupled to a Quantel IDIS Mobile Digital Subtraction Angiogram Unit (Quantel Medical Products Group, Clemmons, N.C.) for image enhancement and immediate playback. There were no postoperative deaths or neurologic complications. Abnormal radiographic results led to reopening of endarterectomy sites in eight patients, which resulted in successful correction of the defects. There was a single asymptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery at 3 weeks in the patient with the only false-negative result on the completion study. Intraarterial digital subtraction angiography is a safe and useful technique for intraoperative quality control of carotid endarterectomy. It provides visual images that can be easily repeated in several projections, uses small volumes of contrast, and has no timing requirements for filming and injecting.\r"

  ".U": "89217147\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the natural history of changes in plaque morphology and luminal diameter of atherosclerotic carotid arteries, we used duplex scanning to follow-up (1) the contralateral artery in 289 patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy, with a mean follow-up 22 months and a range of 0 to 48 months and (2) the carotid arteries in 130 patients who had no surgical treatment and had been symptom free, with a mean follow-up period of 15 months and a range of 0 to 48 months. Plaques were graded as to the ratio of echolucency to echogenicity, with type 1 being most echolucent and type 4 being most echogenic. A normal-appearing artery was classified as type 5. Heterogeneous plaques (types 1 and 2) occurred significantly more (p less than 0.001) in symptomatic preoperative arteries than in asympatomatic arteries. Follow-up of the asymptomatic vessels showed that the majority of plaques either remained the same or became more echogenic (fibrous). Approximately one fourth of plaques in each group degenerated (more echolucent). Thirty-one patients (10.7%) developed new symptoms in the contralateral asymptomatic group, with 10 patients (3.5%) having strokes. Fourteen of 130 (10.8%) patients, or 5.4% of vessel territories at risk, in the primary asymptomatic group developed new symptoms, with only two strokes occurring. In the contralateral asymptomatic group those patients who initially had greater than 75% stenoses fared worse than those with primary asymptomatic disease with greater than 75% stenosis. Although the overall development of new symptoms is low in both populations, our data indicate that those patients with heterogeneous plaques or whose plaques have undergone change may be at risk for new symptoms. Longer follow-up studies are needed to define the role of plaque changes in the development of symptoms. For now we advocate a conservative \"wait and see\" approach to symptom-free patients with greater than 75% stenoses and calcified plaques. We suggest a more aggressive approach, recommending early surgical intervention, to those few patients with heterogeneous plaques.\r"

From 1981 to 1986, 13 patients with quadriplegia at the New England Regional Model Spinal Cord Injury Center had caval interruption with a Greenfield filter. Twelve patients had deep venous thrombosis documented by venogram results and one had pulmonary embolism documented by arteriogram results. \"Quad cough\" chest physical therapy was required for mobilization of pulmonary secretions in nine patients. Follow-up abdominal x-ray results revealed significant abnormalities referrable to the filter in five patients having undergone \"quad cough\" therapy. Four patients had distal migration of the filter; three of the four had deformation of the filter. Laparotomy for bowel perforation was required in two of these patients. Quadriplegia requiring vigorous chest physical therapy (\"quad cough\") for pulmonary toilet may be a contraindication to caval interruption by Greenfield filter. Alternative techniques in the management of patients with quadriplegia and pulmonary compromise must be considered.\r"

Developments in instrumentation and techniques have reduced the incidence of complications, notably perforation, to an acceptable level. Initial data show that recanalization of iliac, femoral, and popliteal lesions can be accomplished in a majority of cases, with the chance of success being inversely proportional to the length of occlusion. Results in the tibial vessels are disappointing. Patency of the treated vessels at 12 months appears to be superior to that of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for similar lesions but inferior to that of surgical bypass for all occlusions greater than 3 cm in length.\r"

The brain is not an immunologically privileged site in the strict sense; under certain carefully defined circumstances, grafts can last for long periods of time, but many such grafts are rejected naturally or following various types of provocation. Factors important to the survival of neural grafts are the use of embryonic tissue, the immunogenetic match, the level of expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens in brain cells close to the graft, and the presence of neural degeneration near the graft. Much additional basic experimental work must be done, however, before a rational approach to the clinical use of neural grafts can be undertaken.\r"

Human immunodeficiency virus seroprevalence among IVDUs in drug treatment programs in the United States ranged from 0% to 65%. Seroprevalence was highest in the Northeast (10% to 65%) and Puerto Rico (45% to 59%); lower in the South Atlantic (7% to 29%) and in the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Ga (10%), Detroit, Mich (7% to 13%), and San Francisco, Calif (7% to 13%); and 5% or less in other areas of the West, the Midwest, and the South. Among IVDUs seen in drug treatment programs, risk of infection was not associated with gender or age but was associated with black and Hispanic ethnicity, male homosexual orientation, and certain intravenous drug-use practices. Cross-sectional and cohort studies indicated increases in seroprevalence of between 0% and 14% per year among IVDUs in treatment. We estimated that between 61,000 and 398,000 IVDUs in the United States were infected with human immunodeficiency virus, or 5% to 33% of the IVDU population. High rates of infection among IVDUs in treatment in the Northeast indicate the potential for rapid spread in regions where rates are currently low. An urgent need exists to monitor human immunodeficiency virus infection levels and trends more widely and to develop effective programs to reduce the further spread of human immunodeficiency virus infection among IVDUs.\r"

The control group was provided with a reference product of the same consistency and taste containing 0.1 Kcal/ml, 400 ml/day for 13 wk. The fed group had a mean weight gain of 1.5 kg during the study period, the control group increased concomitantly 0.16 kg, the difference being significant (p less than 0.01). Sum of four skinfolds increased 2.7 mm in the fed group, and decreased 0.9 mm in the control group the difference being significant (p less than 0.01). No difference were observed regarding pulmonary function or immunological status. We also found a high habitual energy intake in our study group (204% Basal Energy Expenditure). We conclude that nutritional supplementation produce weight gain in malnourished patients with EP, but it does not change other indices of well-being.\r"

In normal kidney HLA-DR and/or -DY versus DQ or DP antigens were shown to be differentially expressed on subpopulations of glomerular and interstitial cells, as well as vascular endothelia. Normal proximal tubular epithelia lacked HLA-DQ and -DP antigens, but carried -DY and variably -DR products constitutively. In comparison, aberrant presence of HLA-DQ and/or -DP antigens was found on proximal tubular cells in the majority of patients with rapidly progressive (RPGN), membranoproliferative GN (MPGN), or focal glomerular sclerosis (FGS), but more rarely observed in other forms of proliferative or non-proliferative GN. In addition all cases with RPGN revealed reduction of HLA-DQ, -DR, -DP or -DY+ glomerular cells. Decline of HLA-DP and/or -DR+ glomerular cells was variably seen in mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MesPGN) and MPGN, whereas in FGS HLA-DQ antigens appeared to be increased in glomeruli. HLA-DQ, -DR, -DY+ interstitial cellular infiltrates were present in RPGN, FGS and MPGN and only occasionally occurred in other forms of GN. Altered renal expression of HLA-class II antigens may indicate specific sites of immunologically-mediated kidney injuries in GN.\r"

In this study, we evaluated the potential benefit of chronically administering the TX synthetase inhibitor OKY-046 from the time of transplantation in a rat model of acute renal allograft rejection. In animals which received 75 mg/kg/day of OKY-046 by intermittent i.p. injection, allograft function was not improved, but renal thromboxane production was not significantly inhibited. However, animals which received an equivalent dose of OKY-046 by continuous intra-arterial infusion for four days maintained clearances of inulin (4.46 +/- 0.79 ml/min/kg) and PAH (23.86 +/- 1.81 ml/min/kg) at normal levels not different from non-rejecting isografts (4.83 +/- 0.93 and 18.33 +/- 2.55 ml/min/kg, respectively). In contrast, animals which received continuous infusion of saline vehicle alone developed a significant reduction in renal function (CIn: 1.58 +/- 0.27 ml/min/kg; CPAH: 9.12 +/- 1.51 ml/min/kg) by the fourth day after transplantation. Intra-arterial infusion of OKY-046 significantly reduced four-day allograft TXB2 production, as well as urinary TXB2 excretion, but had no effect on allograft production of PGE2 or 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Despite the beneficial effects on allograft function, OKY-046 neither altered the morphologic appearance of the cellular infiltrate nor the systemic proliferative and cytotoxic anti-donor cellular immune responses. Six days following transplantation, renal TXB2 production was only partially inhibited in animals given continuous infusions of OKY-046, and remained markedly elevated. This partial inhibition of TX production resulted in a slight but insignificant functional improvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Increased urinary excretion of C5b-9 distinguishes passive Heymann nephritis from other forms of experimental glomerulonephritis in the rat. In the passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) model of membranous nephropathy (MN) subepithelial deposits form from anti-Fx1A antibody reacting with antigen expressed on the glomerular epithelial cell membrane followed by membrane patching and shedding of immune complexes. Immune complex deposits are accompanied by deposits of C5b-9 which is required for the mediation of proteinuria. We tested the hypothesis that C5b-9 assembly on the epithelial cell membrane might result in C5b-9 excretion in the urine, which would distinguish this autoimmune mechanism of MN from other processes that result in subepithelial immune complex deposits. Using monoclonal antibodies developed to rat C6 and a rat C5b-9 neoantigen, in a sensitive ELISA assay, elevated urinary excretion of rat C5b-9 was documented in PHN associated with on-going glomerular immune deposit formation. No urinary C5b-9 was detectable in MN induced by an exogenous antigen (cationized IgG) despite equivalent glomerular C5b-9 deposits, or in models of nephrotoxic nephritis, subendothelial immune complex nephritis, anti-mesangial cell membrane antibody-induced nephritis or two non-immune nephropathies. Infusion of preformed C5b-9 in proteinuric animals excluded glomerular filtration of C5b-9 as a contributing mechanism to urinary C5b-9 excretion. We conclude that in the rat, increased urinary excretion of C5b-9 is a marker of MN induced by antibody to a glomerular epithelial cell antigen. Urine C5b-9 excretion reflects active glomerular immune deposit formation and distinguishes MN induced by this mechanism from other forms of MN as well as from other glomerular diseases with equivalent glomerular C5b-9 deposits.\r"

Hyperkalemia developed in ESRD patients after 16 hours of fasting, as compared with control subjects (P = 0.02). The hemodynamic response to epinephrine was similar in the two groups. During epinephrine infusion for one hour, the serum potassium decreased in normal subjects, from 4.3 +/- 0.2 mEq/liter to 3.9 +/- 0.1 mEq/liter, but did not change in ESRD patients (P = 0.005). Serum CO2 declined in ESRD, but not in control subjects, while glucose levels were not different in the two groups. Plasma aldosterone was significantly higher in fasting ESRD patients and failed to decrease during epinephrine infusion as compared to controls. Plasma insulin levels remained low in both groups even though serum glucose levels increased. These results demonstrate that hyperkalemia occurs during fasting in ESRD probably as the result of insulinopenia, and suggest that a diminished response to epinephrine may contribute to hyperkalemia.\r"

Preliminary clinical studies utilizing more permeable artificial kidney membranes suggest their potential usefulness in the prevention of HRA syndromes, specifically those attributable to persistent elevation of serum beta 2-M; however, caution in their employment is advised. The development of effective treatment for long-term hemodialysis patients afflicted with CTS, arthritic symptoms and skeletal manifestations of HRA is unfortunately constrained by deficiencies in our knowledge. Renal transplantation has been demonstrated to reduce the elevated serum beta 2-M levels in hemodialysis patients to normal; however, the effectiveness of this modality to treat clinical manifestations of HRA has not been reported. Thus, efficacious treatment strategies have lagged considerable behind diagnostic techniques. Intensive research is needed as the story of this new form of renal osteodystrophy unfolds.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to study the mechanism of cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity and hypertension. Cultured rat microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to cyclosporine for up to six days at one of the following concentrations: 10, 50, 250, and 1000 ng/ml of culture medium. Cyclosporine inhibited endothelial cell replication in a dose-dependent manner; at higher concentrations (250 and 1000 ng/ml), cell replication decreased by as much as 70 to 90% of controls at four and six days post-treatment, with no evidence of increased cell death. Drug-treated endothelial cells revealed abnormal morphological changes such as formation of cytoplasmic vesicles and nucleolar changes. Prostacyclin release by endothelial cells was increased by about threefold with the addition of cyclosporine (P less than 0.01). Indomethacin significantly decreased prostacyclin release by endothelial cells in the presence or absence of cyclosporine (P less than 0.01). Our data suggest that cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity may be mediated, at least partly, by the inhibitory influence of cyclosporine on the regenerative response of microvascular endothelial cells to injury, and the resultant alterations in prostacyclin production by these cells.\r"

  ".W": "We examined whether the retroviral envelope antigen, gp70, is a major nephritogenic antigen in ddY mice, a murine model of spontaneous mesangial glomerulonephritis associated with IgA and IgG deposition. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the mesangial gp70 deposition increased with age in mice over 24 weeks old, as did the IgG and IgA deposits. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the reaction products of gp70 superimposed on the electron dense deposits in the mesangial matrix. Various amounts of serum gp70 were detected in mice as young as 12 weeks without any apparent increase with age. There was no correlation between the serum level of gp70 and the extent of the glomerular gp70 deposition, whereas mice with heavier IgA deposition had higher mean levels of serum IgA. The absorption test demonstrated that significant amounts of serum gp70 composed immune complexes in 40 week-old ddY mice developing glomerulonephritis; however, this bound form of gp70 was not observed in 12 week-old mice without glomerulonephritis. Systemic examinations by immunofluorescence staining showed that gp70 was mainly localized in various lymphoid tissues. These findings suggest that the gp70 antigen, mostly derived from lymphoid cells, may circulate as immune complexes and accumulate in the mesangial area, thus contributing to the development of glomerulonephritis in these mice. In addition, the pathogenic role of the increased IgA production in these mice was discussed.\r"

  ".W": "This study represents the first randomized prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy of 1,25(OH)2D3 on bone histology and serum biochemistry in patients with mild to moderate renal failure. Sixteen patients with chronic renal impairment (creatinine clearance 20 to 59 ml per min) received either 1,25(OH)2D3, at a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 microgram daily (eight patients), or placebo. Transiliac crest bone biopsies were performed before entrance into the study and after 12 months of experimental observation. None of the patients were symptomatic or had radiological evidence of bone disease. Of the thirteen patients who completed the study, initial serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were low in seven patients and parathyroid hormone levels were elevated in seven patients. Bone histology was abnormal in all patients. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment was associated with a significant fall in serum phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase concentrations as well as with histological evidence of an amelioration of hyperparathyroid changes. In contrast to previous reports, no deterioration of renal function attributable to the treatment occurred, perhaps because a modest dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 was employed combined with meticulous monitoring. Further investigation is required to determine whether alternative therapeutic strategies (smaller doses or intermittent therapy) may avoid the potential for suppressing bone turnover to abnormally low levels in the long term.\r"

All were febrile and 16 had positive blood cultures. In 7 cases, (4 diabetics and 3 malnourished alcoholics) PN was painless, diagnosis was delayed and lesions were severe. Two diabetics underwent emergency nephrectomy for sepsis. Conventional radiological techniques (IVP and ultrasonography) were poorly informative. In contrast, initial CT abnormalities were visible in 44 patients. They consisted of triangular or round hypodense images, diffuse hypodensity in a grossly swollen kidney, and/or abscesses. Hypodense images were presumably due to acute focal ischemia. Renal histology was available in five patients. It showed acute interstitial nephritis with leukocyte infiltrates, edema and hemorrhagic streaks. Pyelonephritis was due to E. coli in 48 cases (87.5%). In 27 cases E. coli isolates were studied by genotypic assays which detect the three most frequent (pap, afa and sfa) of the four operons known to encode adhesin. In all cases, at least one of these genotypic markers of uropathogenicity was found. In 27 cases, repeat CT was done shortly after treatment. It showed healing in only 12. Early cortical scar formation was visible in 2. Final evaluation in 27 cases with adequate follow-up showed that (in addition to the 2 patients who had been nephrectomized), in only 17 of 27 (63%) had the kidneys recovered a normal appearance. In two cases one kidney had undergone atrophy; renal biopsy showed subacute-chronic interstitial nephritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Returning to the patient presented today, perhaps we can now understand some of his findings. As I noted, men are more likely to demonstrate alterations in calcium metabolism associated with elevations in blood pressure. Furthermore, blacks are more likely than whites to develop hyperparathyroidism, particularly in the third and fourth decades of life. It is unlikely, however, that parathyroid hormone was responsible for the increase in this patient's arterial pressure because PTH has a vasodilating action. Moreover, the long-term response to parathyroidectomy is more likely to be an increase rather than a decrease in blood pressure. It is also unlikely that the mild elevations in the serum total calcium observed in this patient were responsible for his hypertension. Correction of hypercalcemia by surgical intervention failed to improve the blood pressure. There is little evidence that mild, protracted hypercalcemia can account for increases in arterial pressure. Finally, the patient's alcohol abuse might have contributed to his elevated blood pressure; it is possible that his hypertension was in part a reflection of the abnormal calcium metabolism he developed as a consequence of the alcohol abuse. Answers to some questions we faced when we first studied this patient more than a decade ago can be provided by the wealth of basic research and clinical investigation that has occurred since. We now know that calcium metabolism is a factor in blood pressure regulation in some humans and in some experimental models. Epidemiologic studies document a consistent association between lower dietary calcium intake and higher blood pressures in humans. An additional non-pharmacologic approach has been identified that can produce a modest but important lowering of blood pressure in a subset of hypertensive individuals. Much data show that calcium-regulating hormones have important cardiovascular actions that might account for some of the mechanisms by which increased dietary calcium lowers blood pressure. Research in this area also has set the stage for exploring another theoretical mechanism for sodium-chloride-sensitive hypertension. Finally, a theoretical mechanism(s) has emerged that could provide a pathophysiologic link between hypertension and certain high-risk populations such as blacks, the elderly, type-II diabetics, and pregnant women. The principal clinical implication derived from this work to date is the following: In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, the level of dietary calcium intake should be assessed. Patients whose intake is deficient should be encouraged simply to maintain calcium intake at 800 to 1000 mg/day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Compared to CON, significant hypertension was prevented, kidney weight was lower and there was less proteinuria in HHR, CAP and ENP rats followed for 30 weeks after UNX. Morphologic studies of these four groups revealed that antihypertensive therapy reduced the incidence of glomerular sclerosis in UNX SHR by 50%. Despite complete absence of systemic hypertension, there was striking medial thickening of lobular arteries and arterioles of rats given the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. These vascular abnormalities were present to a lesser degree in rats given ENP, but were entirely absent in untreated animals or in those ingesting the HHR combination. Micropuncture studies performed five weeks after UNX in four additional groups of CON, HHR, CAP and ENP rats revealed that glomerular capillary pressure was elevated in CON and reduced by all three drug regimens. These studies support the hypothesis that glomerular capillary hypertension and/or nephron hypertrophy predispose to glomerular injury in this model of hypertension and reduced renal mass. ACE inhibitors and HHR are equivalent in their ability to prevent glomerular hypertension and damage in these rats, but the former, and in particular captopril, produce abnormalities of cortical vessels via a mechanism not dependent on the presence of systemic hypertension.\r"

Since organomercurials are also known to react with sulfhydryl groups, the present studies determined the effects of sulfhydryl reagents on renin secretion. The effects of the non-diuretic mercurial agent, parachloromercuriphenyl-sulfonate (PCMPS), as well as that of other sulfhydryl reagents, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), N-phenylmaleimide (NPM) and monobromotrimethylammoniobimane (qBBR), on renin secretion were determined in rabbit renal cortical slices. All four reagents stimulated renin secretion. NEM, which has a high membrane permeability, stimulated secretion to a relatively small extent and its effects were not apparent for at least one hour. Conversely, PCMPS, which is much less permanent than NEM, produced the largest stimulation and these effects were apparent within one hour. The stimulation of secretion by sulfhydryl reagents was independent of the concentration of Ca2+, Na+, and K+ in the incubation media, suggesting that the stimulation is not secondary to alterations of intracellular ion concentrations. These results raise the possibility of direct involvement of sulfhydryl groups of particular membrane protein(s) of the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in some steps leading to renin secretion, and raise the possibility that sulfhydryl reactivity might in part account for the stimulatory effects of organomercurial and other diuretics.\r"

Our goal in the present study was to determine whether the NC1 domain of the collagen type IV molecule, which contains Goodpasture antigen (GPA), could be demonstrated in these dogs, and to assess its immunological reactivity. By SDS-PAGE, NC1 in collagenase digests of glomerular basement membranes (GBM) of unaffected and carrier female dogs in the family with SHG showed 24 kilodalton (kD), 26 kD and 28 kD monomer, and 46 kD and 47 kD dimer components, but the 24 kD monomer was diminished in the affected males. By IF, a rabbit antibody to NCl stained glomerular capillaries of unaffected, affected male, and carrier female dogs. In contrast, a human anti-GBM plasmapheresis fluid (PPF) stained glomerular capillaries of only the unaffected and carrier female dogs. By RIA, both antibodies reacted strongly with NCl in collagenase digests of GBM of the unaffected and carrier female dogs, but showed reduced reactivity with NCl of affected males. By Western blotting, both antibodies bound to dimers and 24 kD and 26 kD monomers of the NCl domain in collagenase digests of GBM of unaffected and carrier female dogs. However, in affected males, the rabbit anti-NCl antibody did not bind to the 24 kD monomer, while the human anti-GBM PPF showed weak binding to the 24 kD and 26 kD monomers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-one were children and 198 were adults. Modified classification of Meadow et al (1972) for Henoch-Schonlein nephritis was used for the histologic grading of glomerular lesions. Forty-three adults (18%) exhibited histologic grades IV and V lesions in association with more severe clinical findings, when compared to the remaining 196 patients with histologic grades I to III. A significant difference was noted between children and adults in the severity of the glomerular lesions (P less than 0.01). Mesangial deposits were observed in all (100%), subendothelial deposits in 37%, subepithelial deposits in 18%, abnormalities in glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in 20%, mesangiolysis in 44%, and mesangial interposition in 25%. The frequency of GBM abnormalities and subepithelial deposits in children was significantly higher than that seen in adults (P less than 0.01). The abnormalities of GBM were not related to more severe clinical manifestations when our analysis was restricted to grade III histologic lesions. All of the above ultrastructural changes except for mesangial deposits were associated with more severe histologic grading in adults (P less than 0.025 or P less than 0.01). Yet a correlation between these ultrastructural changes and histologic grading could not be studied in children due to confinement of their histology within a more benign group. These results suggest that the five ultrastructural parameters described here appear to bear important prognostic value in adults with IgAN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is known, however, that viper venom induces several clinical abnormalities that favor the development of acute renal failure. These alterations include a varying degree of bleeding, hypotension, circulatory collapse, intravascular hemolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with or without microangiopathy. A direct cytotoxic action of snake venom on the kidney is suspected, but convincing evidence is still lacking. Severe hypocomplementemia is consistently present, but I doubt its role in the causation of renal lesions. Hypersensitivity to venomous or antivenomous protein occasionally causes acute renal failure. In sea snake poisoning, myonecrosis and myoglobinuria appear to play the predominant pathogenetic role. The renal lesions of clinical significance in envenomed patients are acute tubular and patchy or diffuse cortical necrosis. Glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, and papillary necrosis have been reported in rare patients. I trust that this overview of the clinical and basic-science aspects of snake-bite-induced acute renal failure will prompt investigators to further define the pathogenetic mechanisms involved. Lessons learned may aid patients with acute renal failure of diverse causes, both here in India and around the world.\r"

  ".W": "Our results provide important evidence that IL-2 receptor bearing cells are required for undesired immune reactions involved in autoimmunity, allograft rejection and nephritogenic processes. Administration of anti-IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies prolonged vascularized heart allograft survival across major histocompatibility barrier in mice and rats and renal monkey grafts. Indeed, several grafts survived indefinitely, although the antibody was administered only for the first 10 days post-transplantation. Rejection of the remaining grafts may well reflect inadequate dosage of antibody; dose-response studies have not been performed to date. In addition to preventing rejection, delayed treatment with anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody was shown to reverse ongoing rejection in other recipients of heart allografts. Such long-term engraftment following cessation of therapy makes it unlikely that anti-IL-2R treatment prolongs graft survival by pharmacologic blockade of the IL-2R. Furthermore, exogenous IL-2 does not diminish the beneficial effects of anti-IL-2R antibody therapy in rodents. Whether or not such prolonged graft survival represents deletion of the responding T cell clones is a subject of current investigation. Results in a delayed-type hypersensitivity model indicate that complement fixation, is required to achieve optimal immunosuppression. Moreover, only anti-receptor antibodies that block IL-2 binding mediate optimal immunosuppression. Passive transfer experiments clearly prove that immediate post-transplant courses of anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody spares suppressor T cells. In rodent models, delayed type hypersensitivity and lupus and diabetic autoimmunity are prevented by anti-IL-2R treatment. Finally, the availability of monoclonal antibodies directed against the human IL-2R provides an opportunity to extend this principle to clinical transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The major risk of DST is sensitization of the recipient to donor lymphocytes precluding transplantation. Fifty prospective recipients of a living related transplant received either DST with cyclosporin A (group I) or DST alone (group II). Persistent donor sensitization precluding transplantation occurred in no patients in group I but in six in group II (P less than 0.05). Ten of 14 of those who developed donor cytotoxicity had previously been pregnant or received greater than or equal to 10 third party transfusions compared with 11 of 36 without such a history (P less than 0.05). Alloantibodies detected by a cellular ELISA developed following DST in 29% patients and antiidiotypic antibodies detected by the short antiidiotypic assay (SAA) in 36%; antiidiotypic activity occurred more frequently in those given cyclosporin A (P less than 0.02). Potentiating activity in the SAA which occurred in sera from six patients after DST had no influence on transplant outcome. Persistent sensitization, particularly in potential transplant recipients who have been pregnant or received many transfusions, can be prevented by giving cyclosporin A with DST; the mechanisms of this effect may be the induction of antiidiotypic antibodies. Both alloantibodies and antiidiotypic antibodies are induced by DST and may protect a subsequent renal allograft from the specific donor.\r"

  ".W": "The experimental and clinical data suggest that both a decrease of antigen expression and decreased perfusion can protect against immunologically mediated destructive processes. In the adaptation of skin grafts, these factors could be interrelated. Inadequate perfusion might lead to a decreased delivery of substances that stimulate MHC antigen expression. This course of events also could explain the protection in the patient presented here. Immune deposits were completely absent in the protected segment of the kidney, although immune deposits were abundantly present in the remaining part of the kidney, and circulating anti-donor antibodies were demonstrable after the transplanted kidney had been removed. The limited availability of frozen biopsy material has prevented us from comparing the expression of MHC antigens in both kidney segments using monoclonal antibodies. But such studies might be done in experimental kidney transplants with an artificially induced stenosis of the renal artery. Except when an arterial stenosis is present, we have little reason to assume that perfusion gradually decreases in longstanding kidney grafts as it does in skin grafts. Therefore, if adaptation plays a role in the gradual decrease of the sensitivity to rejection in longstanding kidney grafts, this phenomenon must be attributed to a decreased expression of target antigens as a consequence of factors other than decreased perfusion. The most likely candidates are the immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine and prednisone, which decrease MHC antigen expression. Let me conclude by returning to my main theme of graft adaptation. It seems appropriate to end this review with a quotation from one of Woodruff's original publications on this subject: \"If the phenomenon [adaptation] applies to homotransplants of normal tissues to sites other than the eye, I think it almost certain that the clinical homograft problem will be solved; if it does not, the problem may prove insoluble\" [9]. Although our insight into the rejection process has increased considerably, we still do not know which factors are most important in determining the long-term survival of primarily vascularized grafts.\r"

When antigen/antibody IC first form in the circulation, complement inhibits their aggregation because the covalent binding of C3b to the IC modifies their biophysical properties and they remain soluble. Such opsonized (C3b coated) IC attach to cells bearing C3b receptors (CR1) in the circulation, in particular to erythrocytes, since in humans 85 to 90% of CR1 in the blood is located on these cells. This immune adherence binding reaction appears to be a physiological system that allows IC to be transported through the circulation to the fixed macrophages of the MPS where they are safely eliminated. The deposition of circulating complement-fixing IC in various organs such as the kidney may be considered as a failure of this transport system. This is apparent in complement deficient and depleted states, and also for non-complement-fixing IC (IgA IC). The formation of insoluble IC (by definition immune deposits found in human pathology are insoluble) produces complement activation and inflammation at the site of the immune aggregate.\r"

  ".U": "89218075\r", 
  ".W": "Two hundred four infants and children (mean age 13 months) have undergone operation for the relief of tracheoesophageal obstruction resulting from vascular anomalies. One hundred thirteen patients had complete vascular rings (group I), 61 with double aortic arch and 52 with right aortic arch with a left ligamentum. Nine patients had a pulmonary artery sling (group II), 71 had innominate artery compression (group III), and 11 had miscellaneous anomalies (group IV). Patients were admitted with respiratory distress, stridor, apnea, dysphagia, or recurrent respiratory infections. Diagnosis was established by barium esophagogram in group I; barium esophagogram, bronchoscopy, and computed tomography or angiography in group II; bronchoscopy in group III; and barium esophagogram or angiography in group IV. The operative approach was through a left thoracotomy in group I, II and IV (93% of these patients) and through a right thoracotomy for group III (96% of these patients). The operative mortality rate was 4.9% and there were seven late deaths (3.4%). There have been no operative deaths in patients with isolated vascular anomalies in the past 28 years. Follow-up data from 1 month to 20 years (mean 8.5 months) were available on 159 patients; 141 (92%) were essentially free of symptoms, and 12 (8%) had residual respiratory problems. Five of six patients in group II having a lung scan postoperatively had a patent left pulmonary artery. A strong index of suspicion is necessary to avoid the complications of vascular rings in children. Barium swallow is the best single diagnostic technique for patients with complete vascular rings. A bronchoscopic study is required to diagnose innominate artery compression. Angiograms or computed tomographic scans are used to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary artery sling. Left thoracotomy provides excellent exposure for all vascular rings except the displaced innominate artery, for which a right thoracotomy is the best approach.\r"

  ".U": "89218083\r", 
  ".W": "Pentastarch is a hydroxyethyl starch similar to hetastarch, but with a lower average molecular weight (264,000 versus 450,000) and fewer hydroxyethyl groups (molar substitution ratio = 0.45 versus 0.70). These characteristics result in enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis, faster renal elimination (initial intravascular half-life = 2.5 versus 25.5 hours), and less effect on coagulation. We report on a randomized clinical trial comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of 10% pentastarch (group P) for plasma volume expansion after cardiac operations with that of 5% serum albumin (group A). During the first 24 hours after arrival of the patient in the intensive care unit, colloid was infused to maintain a cardiac index of 2.0 L/m2 or more and a mean arterial pressure within 10% of the preinduction value. Group P (n = 50) received 1706 +/- 393 ml of colloid (mean +/- standard deviation) during this period, and group A (n = 44), 1794 +/- 341 ml (p = no significant difference). Hemodynamic responses to infusion were similar for both groups, although in group P a greater increase in both cardiac index (0.5 +/- 0.5 versus 0.3 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2 in group A, p less than 0.01) and left ventricular stroke work index (10.8 +/- 8.0 versus 5.8 +/- 6.0 gm-m/m2, p less than 0.01) was observed during infusion of the first 500 ml. There were no significant differences in any of the measured respiratory parameters (alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, estimated shunt fraction, and effective pulmonary compliance). Hemodilution with colloid significantly reduced serum protein levels in group P by 24 hours postoperatively (4.0 +/- 0.6 versus 5.0 +/- 0.7 gm/dl in group A, p less than 0.05), although mean serum colloid osmotic pressure was similar (15.4 +/- 2.6 [P] versus 15.5 +/- 2.7 mmHg [A], p = no significant difference). There were no significant between-group differences in prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, bleeding time, or coagulation factors (fibrinogen, V, VII, VIII, or IX) on postoperative days 1 and 7. Perioperative fluid balance, weight change, chest tube output, red blood, platelet, or fresh frozen plasma usage, reexploration for bleeding, and clinical outcome were also similar. These findings indicate that pentastarch is as safe and effective s 5% albumin for plasma volume expansion after cardiac operations with no apparent adverse effects on coagulation. If commercially available at a lower cost than albumin, it would appear to be a reasonable first choice for colloid therapy in this setting.\r"

The issue was examined on data from the British Regional Heart Study for 7735 middle-aged men followed up for an average of 7.5 years; during this time 443 men experienced a major IHD event. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or above, diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or above, or receiving treatment for hypertension. For both hypertensive and normotensive men the rate of major IHD events, standardised for age and cigarette smoking, rose with increasing body mass index (BMI). The relative odds associated with a 5 kg/m2 difference in BMI (ie, a 15 kg difference in weight in men of average height [1.73 m]) were 1.30 (p = 0.02) and 1.43 (p = 0.0004) for hypertensive and normotensive men, respectively. A review of eleven prospective studies, including the British Regional Heart Study, presented in standard form for comparative purposes, suggests that lean hypertensive men are not at higher risk of major IHD events than overweight/obese hypertensive men. There seems to be no justification for the suggestion that a policy of weight reduction to lower blood pressure might be inappropriate.\r"

Purification was monitored in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell cultures by (3H)-thymidine incorporation into DNA. Crude tumor extracts with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The active materials precipitated by 35% to 50% ammonium sulfate were further purified by Bio-Rex 70 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif.) cation exchange chromatography. Active fractions eluted by 0.5 M to 0.7 M NaCl were further analyzed via heparin-sepharose affinity chromatography. This resulted in separation of one major peak eluted by 0.9 M to 1.2 M NaCl and confirmed to promote human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell proliferations, and three other peaks. The molecular weight determination of the most active fraction performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography utilizing TSK 2000 gel column indicates 41,000 and 19,000 daltons for the active materials, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the angiogenesis properties of a solid tumor (thyroid anaplastic cell carcinoma), are not composed of a simple mechanism in vivo.\r"

Type II collagen appeared under the basal lamina of the otocyst from developmental stages 14 to 16. In the otic capsule, endolymphatic duct, and semicircular canal membrane, type II collagen appeared in stage 23 or 24. From stages 28 to 29, type II collagen appeared in the primitive columella, endolymphatic sac, and fibrocartilaginous plate. Type II collagen was first observed in the crista ampullaris, basilar membrane, macula sacculi, and utriculi in stages 30 and 31. Type II collagen was not detected in the endolymphatic sac beyond developmental stage 37 and the amount of type II collagen in the otic capsule and columella decreased after stage 40. The wide distribution of type II collagen in the inner ear throughout the development of the chick embryo suggests that this collagen may act as a basic structural component of the ear.\r"

Applied to the MEDLINE database, this technology has created a brand new market, one which is increasingly competitive and therefore evolving rapidly. Five MEDLINE and two non-MEDLINE products are reviewed. The MEDLINE products include: BRS/COLLEAGUE DISC, Compact Cambridge, Ebsco's Core MEDLINE, Online Research System's Compact Med-Base, and SilverPlatter's MEDLINE on CD-ROM. The two other products include: Institute for Scientific Information's SCI CD Edition and SilverPlatter's CANCER-CD. The market is still wide open and the buyer is wise to try before he buys. However, there are great differences between the various packagings of a rather familiar product. In our view, in terms of ease of use, SilverPlatter was the clear winner. Ebsco's product is attractive because of its containment on one CD. Med-Base is the most original and offers special features not found elsewhere. Finally, personal preference is a strong consideration and should not be overlooked.\r"

However, during pregnancy, insulin resistance develops in maternal skeletal muscle as a mechanism to spare glucose for use by the developing fetus. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a bout of exercise adversely affects glucose availability to the fetus by increasing glucose uptake in maternal muscle tissue. Pregnant (P) and nonpregnant (NP) rats were divided into rest and exercise groups. Immediately following a 50-min treadmill run, a bolus of glucose (1 g.kg-1) and tracer [1-3H]2-deoxyglucose was injected i.v., and rats underwent a 60-min i.v. glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), after which they were sacrificed. Although glucose levels were lower for P vs NP rats at all time points, prior exercise did not affect glucose levels in either P or NP rats. Plasma insulin levels were augmented in P compared with NP rats and were not significantly altered by prior exercise. Glucose/tracer accumulation was enhanced in red and white gastrocnemius in both P and NP rats, and in soleus of NP rats, by exercise. However, glucose/tracer accumulation in the fetus was decreased by 40% (P less than 0.01) in the exercised dams. These results indicate that uptake of glucose by the fetus is compromised following exercise, as a result of increased glucose uptake by maternal skeletal muscles.\r"

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three training groups: sprint intervals (SI) (N = 8), endurance (E) (N = 10), or combination (C) (N = 7). Training was monitored for 10 wk, and maximal treadmill exercise tests were administered pre-training and after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wk of training. Blood samples were obtained (pre-training and after 10 wk) before, immediately after, and 5 and 15 min following the maximal exercise tests. All groups significantly (P less than 0.05) increased maximal oxygen consumption values at 8 and 10 wk of the training period. Significant exercise-induced increase in plasma beta-EP, ACTH, cortisol, and blood lactate were observed for both pre- and post-training tests in all training groups. The SI group demonstrated significant post-training increases in beta-EP, ACTH, cortisol, and 5 min post-exercise blood lactate concentrations in response to maximal exercise. No training-induced hormonal changes were observed for the E group. While exercise-induced increases were observed, the C group exhibited significant post-training reductions in plasma responses of beta-EP, ACTH, and blood lactate concentrations in response to maximal exercise. Still, resting and post-exercise increases in plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in magnitude in the post-training test. Lactate was significantly correlated with beta-EP (r = 0.72), ACTH (r = 0.70), and cortisol (r = 0.64).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The treatment group was compared with two age-matched groups: a jogger group (N = 10) and a sedentary group (N = 10). Venous blood was collected in the early morning after the subjects had been fasting for at least 12 h. The subjects were also resting at the time of blood collection. Resting plasma beta E/beta-LPH (measured by radioimmunoassay) decreased (P less than 0.05) following the 4 months of exercise training in the treatment group, from 11.01 +/- 1.62 (SE) to 7.22 +/- 0.99 pmol.1-1. The jogger and sedentary groups demonstrated no changes in the resting plasma beta E/beta-LPH concentration following the 4 months. Aerobic fitness, measured by the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), increased (P less than 0.01) from 36.56 +/- 2.58 (SE) to 44.85 +/- 1.34 ml.kg-1.min-1 in the treatment group after the 4 months of training. There were no changes in VO2max for either the jogger group or the sedentary group following the 4 months. In conclusion, beta E/beta-LPH in the plasma of resting middle-aged men appeared to be decreased after 4 months of aerobic training.\r"

  ".W": "After an active duodenal ulcer has healed in response to medical therapy, the rate of recurrence during the subsequent year is relatively high. We therefore enrolled 140 patients with healed duodenal ulcers in a two-year randomized, double-blind trial comparing maintenance therapy (ranitidine, 150 mg nightly) with placebo for the prevention of recurrent duodenal ulceration. We performed endoscopy annually and when symptoms suggested the recurrence of ulcers. Verified recurrent ulcers in either group were treated for four or eight weeks with open-label ranitidine (150 mg twice a day). Patients whose ulcers healed within eight weeks resumed randomized treatment. Prophylactic therapy with ranitidine reduced the rate of ulcer relapses from 63 percent in the placebo group to 37 percent in the ranitidine group (P less than 0.05). Treatment with ranitidine extended the median ulcer-free interval from one to two years (P less than 0.05). The first recurrences of ulcer were asymptomatic in half the ranitidine group and in a quarter of the placebo group. Prophylactic therapy with ranitidine also reduced the frequency of recurrent ulcers that were unhealed by eight weeks, that were bleeding, that were in the stomach, or that were the second recurrent ulcer within six months, from 43 percent in the placebo group to 21 percent. Patients who drank alcohol, smoked, had a history of ulcer disease, or had duodenal scarring or erosion at the time of entry into the study were at the greatest risk for recurrence and benefited the most from prophylactic ranitidine. We conclude that prophylactic treatment with ranitidine is effective in preventing the recurrence of duodenal ulceration.\r"

Histories of use of analgesics (phenacetin, acetaminophen, and aspirin) were obtained by telephone interview with the patients or their proxies. Daily users of analgesics had significantly more renal disease than infrequent users (odds ratio, 2.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.85 to 4.21). The risk of renal disease was highest in daily users of phenacetin (odds ratio, 5.11; confidence interval, 1.76 to 14.9, after adjustment for the effects of other analgesics). The risk of renal disease was also increased in daily users of acetaminophen; after adjustment for the use of aspirin and phenacetin, the odds ratio was 3.21 (confidence interval, 1.05 to 9.80). There was no increased risk in daily aspirin users (adjusted odds ratio, 1.32; confidence interval, 0.69 to 2.51). The risks with daily use of either phenacetin or acetaminophen changed little after adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, and the indication for analgesic use. We conclude that the long-term, regular use of phenacetin may increase the risk of chronic renal disease. The long-term, daily use of acetaminophen, the major metabolite of phenacetin, is associated independently with an increased risk of chronic renal disease. We could find no increased risk in daily users of aspirin.\r"

This pattern consisted of reverberating flow, with forward flow in systole and retrograde flow in diastole. When this pattern was seen, there was arrest of cerebral flow, as measured by radionuclide scanning using technetium, in all patients studied. Transcranial Doppler is a useful technique for easily assessing the arrest of the cerebral circulation.\r"

Therefore, the specific vulnerability of GABAergic inhibitory neurons to NMDA receptor-mediated toxicity might be an important determinant of the potential for epileptogenesis following these insults. We have examined the fate of GABAergic cortical neurons in mouse cell cultured neuronal population) were identified either by immunoreactivity with antisera to GABA or by autoradiography following high-affinity uptake of 3H-GABA. Cultures exposed for 5 min to 20 to 750 microM NMDA showed NMDA concentration-dependent, widespread neuronal loss. However, GABAergic neurons were relatively spared, and thus represented an enhanced fraction of neuronal survivors. These observations suggest that GABAergic cortical neurons may possess some intrinsic resistance to NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity, a property which might convey an anticonvulsant \"inhibitory safety factor\" to neocortex against certain forms of injury.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of MK-801, a noncompetitive, selective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, in a neonatal hypoxic-ischemic animal model. Seven-day-old rats underwent bilateral ligation of the carotid arteries followed by exposure to an 8% oxygen atmosphere for 1 hr. We sacrificed the animals 72 hrs later and assessed the hypoxic-ischemic brain damage histologically. MK-801 (10 mg/kg), administered IP 0.5 hr before the hypoxia, completely prevented hypoxic-ischemic infarction in cerebral cortex, while treatment immediately and 1 hr after the end of the hypoxia resulted in 76% and 52% reduction in the infarcted area, respectively. MK-801, given 0.5 hr before and immediately after the insult, reduced striatal damage and, given 0.5 hr before, attenuated neuronal necrosis in hippocampal regions. These results show that in neonates MK-801 is neuroprotective even when administered up to 1 hr after the end of a hypoxic-ischemic insult.\r"

The implant can be placed immediately following cataract extraction, after which the cornea is replaced. If cortical remnants cannot be completely removed, the corneal transplant is sutured in place and a limbal incision made; the remaining remnants are then aspirated and a posterior chamber lens is implanted through the limbal incision. If no remnants remain, but the posterior chamber lens cannot be implanted due to positive vitreous pressure, the cornea is sewn into place with seven or eight interrupted sutures and the lens implanted through the remaining open quadrant, after which the corneal transplant procedure is completed.\r"

Histopathologic examination revealed a pigmented iris nevus and signs of iris erosion by the IOL loop. Because 3 months later the eye developed streptococcal endophthalmitis and had to be eviscerated, we had the opportunity to examine the eye contents; we found no evidence of phakoanaphylactic uveitis.\r"

Given the magnitude and changing patterns of intraocular lens usage, a review of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy is appropriate.\r"

In 40 patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery, the authors compared the outpatient use of povidone-iodine for 3 days before surgery with a 3-day course of a combination antibiotic ophthalmic solution (Neosporin) placed on the other eye. All patients also received topical povidone-iodine on the operating table directly preceding surgery. Cultures taken just before preparation of the operative field showed a similar reduction of bacteria by each regimen. Cultures taken after preparation but before commencement of surgery showed a further reduction for both regimens, but more for eyes previously treated with the antibiotic (P less than 0.02). To minimize the conjunctival bacterial flora before surgery, the authors continue to recommend instillation of a broad-spectrum antibiotic for 3 days before surgery, followed by application of povidone-iodine solution to the eye immediately before surgery within the preoperative preparation.\r"
