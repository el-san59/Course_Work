  ".W": "The newborn infant's skin is not a complete barrier to the absorption of externally applied agents, particularly if it is damaged, diseased, or immature. Immaturity is the most important factor that determines percutaneous absorption. Very immature infants in the early neonatal period have a poorly developed epidermis, which is readily permeable to drugs. The main consequences of percutaneous absorption are hazardous. Topically applied agents are absorbed, causing toxic systemic effects that may result in illness and even death without the cause being recognized. No drug or antiseptic agent should be applied to the premature infant's skin without consideration of the effects that might result from percutaneous absorption. On a more optimistic note, the relatively permeable skin could be an advantage to the preterm infant by providing an alternative method of drug administration. The drug theophylline for example can be absorbed and produce therapeutic blood levels for up to 3 days after a single topical application. There is a need for the development of transdermal drug delivery systems for the newborn infant similar to those currently used for therapy in adults.\r"

  ".W": "The determinants of cardiovascular function include preload, myocardial contractility, and afterload. Myocardial contractility and afterload can be altered pharmacologically and form the basis for the clinical management of shock with inotropic and chronotropic drugs. There are extensive data from experiments in laboratory animals that the immature cardiovascular system may respond differently to these inotropic and chronotropic agents than the mature cardiovascular system. Digitalis, isoproterenol, dopamine, and dobutamine are the most frequently used positive inotropic drugs in children. Because of maturational differences in pharmacokinetics, neonates require a larger weight-based dose of digoxin to achieve a similar serum level to adults, but neonates do not require a greater serum level of digitalis to achieve an equivalent inotropic effect as in adults. Isoproterenol increases heart and cardiac output but has no independent effect on renal blood flow. Dopamine is unique among sympathomimetic means because of its independent effect to increase renal and mesenteric blood flow. Dobutamine increases cardiac output with less chronotropic effect than isoproterenol but, unlike dopamine, does not have an independent effect on renal and mesenteric profusion. The \"best\" drug for a specific clinical situation depends on the complex interrelationship of the determinants of cardiovascular function and the underlying disease process. One drug may be more efficacious in a specific clinical setting than another drug. If the desired clinical response is not achieved with an adequate dose of one drug, a different drug or a combination of inotropic agents should be tried.\r"

A host of prognostic factors have emerged, yet it would appear that the major determinants of survival are as yet unrecognized. The diagnosis remains primarily one of exclusion, and management is largely nonspecific and supportive. The frequency of sudden cardiac death is well documented, but the ability to accurately identify patients at risk and the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy is unestablished. The emerging success of cardiac transplantation is a source of encouragement. The causes of dilated cardiomyopathy remain a source of intense investigation. Accumulating evidence (much of it circumstantial) does, however, implicate a viral etiology and perhaps altered function of the immunoregulatory system. However, the disparity between the severity of functional disturbance with the relative lack of histologic markers of cellular necrosis implies a disturbance at a cellular level. The etiology or etiologies remain elusive. Future investigation directed at fundamental aspects of cardiac cellular biology may provide the answers.\r"

Plasma insulin and C-peptide levels in the fasting state and after a 100-g oral glucose load were measured in 17 obese newly diagnosed type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects before and after 1 mo of treatment with glipizide (15 mg/day). Plasma glucose levels decreased significantly after treatment with glipizide. Plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations in the fasting state did not change after glipizide treatment. Also, postglucose plasma insulin levels did not change after glipizide, whereas postglucose plasma C-peptide concentrations significantly increased. A significant relationship was found between the increase in C-peptide plasma levels and the decrease in glycemic profile after glucose load following glipizide treatment. The relation between plasma C-peptide and insulin incremental areas after the oral glucose load significantly increased after treatment. These results suggest that in obese type II diabetic patients, 1 mo of treatment with glipizide potentiates the beta-cell response to oral glucose load and increases insulin metabolism, probably within the liver.\r"

In five patients, diabetic control deteriorated to the point where insulin was reinitiated. In the remaining 22 patients, despite a significant decrease in weight (122 +/- 5 vs. 114 +/- 5% ideal body wt; P less than .025) on chlorpropamide, HDL-chol fell from 49 +/- 4 to 40 +/- 4 mg/dl (P less than .01) when therapy was modified from insulin to the sulfonylurea.

In the 5 patients in whom insulin was reinstituted, HDL-chol increased to its previous level on insulin (P less than .05).

The dependent variable metabolic control was measured as the mean of all random plasma glucose values obtained only at scheduled diabetes clinic visits over 2 yr. Multivariate analysis of the data showed that better metabolic control was most strongly associated with compliance with scheduled appointments. Mode of treatment was also associated with metabolic control. Other variables tested, including source of care, age, sex, duration of diabetes, presence of complications, and weight change, were not associated with metabolic control. The strongest analysis of covariance model with demographic and medical-care variables accounted for 39% of the variance in metabolic control. The analysis suggests that other variables, possibly including several psychosocial variables, need to be assessed for their contribution to metabolic control.\r"

  ".W": "Ten insulin-dependent diabetic patients were investigated from 2100 to 0700 h during treatment with either a bedtime injection (BI) of intermediate-acting insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) at a constant basal rate. In the evening, blood glucose was slightly higher during treatment with BI than with CSII, whereas the metabolic control in the morning was equal on both regimens with a fasting blood glucose of 5.7 mM (4.2-7.1) (median and interquartile ranges) on BI and 5.4 mM (4.6-5.8) on CSII (NS). No rise in morning blood glucose was seen, but serum beta-hydroxybutyrate tended to rise (NS). There was a significant hyperinsulinemia at midnight during BI compared with CSII with a serum free insulin of 14.5 (11.7-16.0) vs. 9.6 (7.2-11.2) mU/L (P less than .05), respectively, and the area under the curve during the middle of the night (midnight to 0400 h) was greater with BI than CSII (P less than .02). A greater fall in blood glucose was seen with BI than with CSII during this period (P less than .02). Differences in blood glucose and serum free-insulin profiles between those using NPH or lente insulin at bedtime were registered. We conclude that, although the same metabolic control in the morning was achievable with CSII at a constant basal rate and BI, CSII is superior for overnight metabolic control due to less-pronounced hyperinsulinemia during the night and a steady-state level of free insulin in the morning.\r"

We compared the changes in blood glucose, plasma free fatty acids, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and free insulin during the interruption from 2300 to 0500 h of the Nordisk Infuser loaded with either U-100 or U-20 regular insulin. The decrease in plasma free-insulin levels was slower, resulting in a significantly delayed and smaller increase in blood glucose levels (2.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 7.6 +/- 2.9 mM, P less than .025) when the pump contained U-100 instead of U-20 insulin. Although the increases in levels of plasma free fatty acids were similar in both tests, the rise in plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate levels tended to be reduced with U-100 insulin (414 +/- 139 vs. 639 +/- 67 microM, P less than .10). Thus, our observations indicate that U-100 insulin gives some protection against the metabolic deterioration due to the interruption of CSII so that diabetic patients may be able to remain without the pump for longer periods with concentrated rather than diluted insulin.\r"

The aim of this study was to assess the role of alterations in insulin dose or caloric intake on blood glucose and free-insulin levels during 12 h after an evening bout of exercise. Nine insulin-dependent diabetic men (28-42 yr of age) receiving two daily injections with a combination of intermediate-acting and soluble insulin participated in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to four treatment protocols: A, 50% reduction in intermediate-acting insulin dose; B, 50% reduction in soluble insulin dose; C, extra caloric intake (1700 kJ) 1 h after exercise; and D, no change. Exercise consisted of 45 min of cycling at 60% of maximal oxygen uptake at each occasion. Glucose and insulin responses were similar for the four protocols. There was a significant (P less than .001) time effect found regardless of treatment, with lowest blood glucose values 75 min after exercise. Hypoglycemia occurred in six of the nine patients at some time during the study, with half of the occurrences on the control night (protocol D). Consistent individual plasma insulin and glucose patterns were observed independent of protocol used. In some patients, hypoglycemia was evident after reductions in insulin dose, and in others it was evident on the night increases in caloric intake were to occur; thus, none of the interventions were totally adequate in preventing exercise-induced hypoglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Initial plasma glucose was elevated, 218 +/- 16 mg/dl (mean +/- SE 12.1 +/- 0.9 mM), but reached the target range after 8 h and remained steady for the rest of the study period. Insulin requirements varied considerably, 0.5-5.0 U/h. Infusion rates were correlated with initial plasma glucose but not with previous insulin dose, HbA1c, or percent ideal body weight. Although insulin needs cannot be predicted, plasma glucose can be maintained in a desirable range after surgery via a simple formula suitable for implementation by general ward nurses.\r"

Intensive diabetes treatment resulted in a significant improvement in glycemic control that caused sustained changes in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels that were not evident with the conventional-treatment program.

However, several factors that may affect interpretation of the data used to develop this ranking need to be considered before the utility of this approach to dietary management can be assessed: 1) duration of time over which the data are collected and analyzed; 2) use of absolute versus incremental areas in the determinations; 3) inclusion or exclusion of negative areas if incremental areas are used; 4) differences in response to a given food in males compared with females; 5) severity of diabetes; 6) confounding effects of oral agents or insulin treatment; 7) reproducibility of data; 8) differences in collection of blood sample; 9) food composition, processing, and preparation; 10) the dose-response relationship to ingestion of a given carbohydrate; 11) the meal being studied, i.e., first, second, or third meal of the day; and 12) a possible effect of the composition of the previous meal, if the response is tested to any meal other than the first meal of the day.\r"

This report was prepared as a practical guide for the management of hypertension in diabetic patients. Although treatment of hypertension in most diabetic patients does not differ from that in nondiabetic patients, this report outlines some special considerations relevant to the presence of both diseases. For both hypertension and diabetes, basic nonpharmacologic therapy consists of dietary alterations, exercise, weight management, smoking cessation, and restricted alcohol intake. These measures should be instituted as initial therapy or concomitant with pharmacologic measures. The stepped-care approach to drug treatment in essential hypertension serves as a guide to therapy. Flexibility in the use of antihypertensive drugs is suggested, and selected practical issues in drug treatment are reviewed.\r"

Furthermore, convulsions have been associated with normeperidine and cardiac toxicities with norpropoxyphene. Hepatic metabolism is the primary route of elimination, except for methadone, for which there is also significant renal excretion. Although the pharmacokinetics of morphine are unchanged in renal insufficiency, accumulation of active metabolites may lead to narcosis. Similar accumulation of normeperidine and norpropoxyphene, metabolites of meperidine and propoxyphene, respectively, as well as propoxyphene itself, and dihydrocodeine and codeine may explain reports of adverse reactions in patients with impaired renal function. A high index of suspicion of opioid-induced toxicities should be maintained in patients who have renal dysfunction and receive opioids.\r"

Corticosteroids exhibiting these properties that are available in the U.S. include beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, and flunisolide. The success or failure of patient response to orally inhaled corticosteroids is often a function of adequate drug delivery rather than the efficacy of the drug itself. Patients who cannot use the inhaler accurately may benefit from the use of a spacer or reservoir device. The three aerosolized corticosteroids have specific pharmacologic differences; however, none of these differences has translated into a clinically significant advantage or disadvantage of one product over the others. These agents should be considered for adjunctive therapy in patients whose asthma is not adequately controlled by beta-agonist bronchodilators, theophylline, or cromolyn sodium.\r"

Inhibition of the synthesis of renal PG by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) may lead to the development of hemodynamically induced renal dysfunction in patients with a decreased effective plasma volume or chronic renal insufficiency. The importance of stimulation of renal PG activity to the action of diuretics and a pharmacodynamic mechanism for NSAID-induced diuretic resistance are presented. Evidence for the relative selectivity of sulindac in inhibiting systemic PG without inhibiting renal PG is also reviewed. Inhibition of renal PG synthesis has been postulated to be a contributing factor for other forms of NSAID-induced renal dysfunction (interstitial nephritis, analgesic-associated nephropathy). The relationship between renal PG inhibition by NSAID and these syndromes is briefly discussed. Considering the frequent use of NSAID, it is important that practitioners are aware of the mechanisms whereby patients may develop NSAID-induced renal dysfunction and that they are able to identify patients at risk.\r"

The antiplatelet actions of aspirin seem to be the most plausible explanation for its efficacy in reducing mortality and the rate of reinfarction. A single daily 325-mg tablet is effective and produces side-effect incidences of only zero to two percent above those produced by placebo.

These abnormalities were found in patients with disease in the colon, with arthropathy and fistula. Antilipid A was found at lower titres in Crohn's disease. Neither antitetanus toxoid antibodies, nor immunoglobulin concentrations were different in patients with or without antilipopolysaccharide antibodies. There was no evidence for circulating immune complexes in patients lacking antilipopolysaccharide antibodies. Certain subgroups of patients with Crohn's disease have altered antibody levels to typical enteral antigens which most likely can be explained by local antibody binding to lipopolysaccharides at inflammatory sites, or by changes in immunoregulation in this disease.\r"

The healing rate was similar in both groups, irrespective of the method of calculation. On an intent-to-treat analysis, healing was: C 66%, C + P 57%, and amongst the patients who completed treatment, healing was 70% in both groups. Patients on C and on C + P experienced a similar decrease in daytime and in night time pain. Side effects of treatment, notably dry mouth and blurred vision, were reported more often by patients on combination therapy. Combined treatment with cimetidine plus pirenzepine in patients with refractory duodenal ulcer is unlikely to be beneficial.\r"

Renal function was assessed by standard clearance techniques and patients in group B had a marked reduction compared with group A in both renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. Raised plasma renin activity was observed in both groups, but levels in group B were significantly higher than in group A. Renal prostacyclin production was estimated by radioimmunoassay (RIA) of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in urine, and the excretion rate was markedly increased in group A as compared with nine healthy controls, but was low in group B. The plasma concentrations of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 were similar in groups A and B and were both significantly higher than in controls. Haemodynamic measurements showed a high cardiac output with low vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure within normal limits in both groups. The pulse pressure, however, was significantly higher in group B than in group A. In conclusion, patients in FHF with renal failure have marked renal vasoconstriction with increased plasma renin activity and reduced renal prostaglandin excretion indicative of an imbalance between vasoactive forces.\r"

The relationship between measured light absorbances and saturation was developed empirically and is built into the oximeter software. Studies in human volunteers have shown good performance of the device in healthy adults for saturations in the range of 70 to 100%. Studies in the operating room and intensive care unit have established its clinical accuracy and usefulness. The pulse oximeter has already found a number of clinical applications outside of the operating room, such as monitoring during patient transport, respiratory monitoring during narcotic administration, and evaluation of home-oxygen therapy. To use this monitor to its full potential, we must be aware of its limitations as well as its advantages. Because of the nature of the HbO2 dissociation curve, saturation measurements will not be sensitive to changes in PaO2 when the PaO2 is greater than 100 torr. This also implies that the pulse oximeter may fail to detect an inadvertent endobronchial intubation in the operating room. It may take minutes to detect an esophageal intubation in a well-preoxygenated patient. When desaturation does occur, the pulse oximeter detects it quickly, accurately, and reliably. Since the pulse oximeter uses two wavelengths of light, it cannot distinguish more than two hemoglobin species. Thus, COHb and MetHb will cause errors in SpO2 if present in large amounts. Intravenously administered dyes can also cause errors because of their absorbance properties, particularly methylene blue and indocyanine green. The pulse oximeter may be unable to detect an adequate signal during abnormal hemodynamic conditions. The pulse oximeter is one of the most important advances in noninvasive monitoring because it provides a means of continuously and quickly assessing arterial blood oxygenation. It is easy to use and interpret, requires little setup time, and poses no additional risks to the patient. Pulse oximetry may soon be a standard of practice for routine monitoring in any clinical setting in which the patient is at risk of hypoxemia.\r"

  ".W": "As the preceding considerations concerning the physical and technical features of oxygen optodes have demonstrated, fluorescence-based optochemical oxygen sensors possess certain advantages and peculiarities compared to conventionally applied electrochemical sensors such as polarographic oxygen electrodes. First, in contrast to oxygen electrodes, oxygen measurements with oxygen optodes do not suffer from distortions caused by the reference electrodes. In addition, because of the polarographic process, platinum electrodes continuously consume oxygen, which falsifies the results, especially when small sample volumes or long-term measurements, or both, are involved, whereas the sensor layer of oxygen optodes must only be equilibrated. Moreover, the surface of the platinum wire has to be catalytically clean in order to obtain a plateau of the polarogram and, consequently, to achieve a low rest current at zero PO2. Unfortunately, the demand for catalytically clean platinum surfaces turns out to be rather critical, since surface contamination occurs even with membranized electrodes, resulting in the well-known phenomenon of \"electrode poisoning.\" The question of the specificity of oxygen electrodes also must be considered. In this context, CO2 and halothane may interfere with oxygen measurements, whereas fluorescence quenching is unaffected by CO2 and halothane affects the measurements only slightly, depending on the special indicator used. Furthermore, because of the flow dependence, oxygen measurements with the oxygen electrode show a distinct \"stirring effect\" caused by the turbulence in front of the electrode, which disturbs the diffusion field. Because of the completely different physical principle of fluorescence optical sensors, such influences are not observed with oxygen optodes. In addition, isolation and shielding of electrical circuits found in electrodes are not necessary for optodes. Furthermore, the sensitivity of oxygen optodes can be tuned to the desired range of PO2 values, resulting in a higher resolution. Use of suitable polymer alloys as indicator matrices can even enhance oxygen sensitivity; therefore, the application of optodes for trace analysis of oxygen might be possible, especially with regard to the application of highly oxygen-sensitive phosphorescent indicators. Finally, owing to the reversibility of fluorescence quenching, monitoring of oxygen by fluorescence optical sensors allows a continuous and remote control of biomedical parameters as well as regulation of biotechnological processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Transcutaneous PO2 sensors have been developed over the past ten years from the same basic electrodes used in conventional blood-gas machines. The skin is heated to enable the skin surface sensors to respond quickly to the gas tensions beneath them. PtcO2 is a variable that reflects the PO2 in the peripheral tissue. PtcO2 has its own range of normal values, and it responds to cardiopulmonary changes that affect tissue oxygenation. In most patients, those without decreased cardiac output, PtcO2 follows the trend of PaO2 and decreases relative to PaO2 with increasing patient age (see Table 2). In the presence of severely reduced cardiac output and peripheral perfusion, the PtcO2 values will deviate from their relationship with the arterial tensions and become blood flow dependent, thus providing quantitative information regarding blood flow. The technique of PtcO2 monitoring likely will gain wider acceptance because it is a noninvasive and continuous monitor that provides useful information regarding tissue oxygenation.\r"

The effect of cimetidine (Tagamet, an H2 receptor antagonist) was investigated as a potential agent for reduction of pulmonary edema following inhalation injury. Control groups included no treatment; smoke only; fluids only; and smoke and fluids. These were compared with identical groups given the same treatments but with the addition of cimetidine (100-150 mg/kg body weight intravenously). Fluids administered were 5% body weight intravenous infusions of lactated Ringer's solution over two hours. Results show that pulmonary edema was evidenced in animals given an inhalation injury, and was markedly worsened by fluid resuscitation. Treatment with cimetidine at high doses, either before or after inhalation injury, did not protect the animals from formation of pulmonary edema.\r"

Data grouped at three-week intervals showed higher flow values in patients with hypertrophic scarring than in those with non-hypertrophic scars. These initial data suggest that hypertrophic scars may be associated with increased microcirculatory blood flow. These values are elevated early and could possibly serve as an early indicator for the occurrence of hypertrophic scarring.\r"

To date, no child has required secondary revision of a full-thickness skin graft nor is it anticipated. There has been no donor-site morbidity thus far. Current protocol for treatment of these injuries depends upon an aggressive program of physical therapy, which includes nocturnal \"sandwich\" splinting and the close participation of the family. Prevention of these injuries will depend upon improved design of safety features for household appliances and consumer education at the time of purchase.\r"

Four groups were examined according to day of first surgical procedure: (1) sooner than five days; (2) 6-10 days; (3) 11-20 days; and (4) later than 20 days. The four groups (similar in age, weight, and percent of TBSA burn) were also analyzed for differences in percent of excised area, blood loss, and length of hospital stay. The amount of excised area in group 1 was significantly larger than in groups 2 and 3, and group 1 also had a significantly greater blood loss. Only in group 4 was the length of stay significantly increased. If excision could be delayed until after day 5, the area excised and the blood loss might be decreased without prolonging hospital stay.\r"

Eighteen well characterised cases of T cell lymphoma, selected to include tumours previously shown to exhibit cross reactivity with antibodies to fixation resistant B cell related antigens, were similarly studied. Neoplastic cells in all but one case were unstained by L26. Twenty seven cases of Hodgkin's disease were also examined. In five cases all Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants were strongly stained by L26; only a proportion of Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants were recognised in a further five cases. Monoclonal antibody L26 promises to be a valuable reagent for the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in routinely fixed and paraffin wax embedded tissues. Its advantage lies in its sensitivity and greater B cell specificity than any of the B cell related reagents currently available for the study of malignant lymphoma in fixed tissues.\r"

The predominant influence on absorption at this stage was probably the conditioning schedule, and the presence of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was not associated with a further impairment of absorption. Six patients with chronic GVHD were studied. When compared with nine patients without GVHD there was a significant (p less than 0.005) reduction of B12 absorption. These findings suggest that the B12 absorption test may be a useful non-invasive method of studying bowel function after bone marrow transplantation.\r"

The test was positive in 16 of 17 sera from patients with connective tissue diseases but in only seven of 36 sera (19%) from patients with non-inflammatory joint diseases. None of the four patients with reactive arthritis was positive by this test. The sensitivity of the assay was comparable with that of the agglutination and immunofluorescence tests for rheumatoid factors and antinuclear factors. For the screening of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies this kind of test panel offers a simple alternative to the conventional tests for small clinical laboratories and for those in which the autoantibody tests could be automated, as the assay can be performed in one working day and only one dilution of serum is needed to obtain a quantitative result.\r"

  ".W": "This review is an update on the literature accumulated over the past 10 years following the original observation that azelaic acid, a naturally occurring and nontoxic C9 dicarboxylic acid, possesses significant biologic properties and a potential as a therapeutic agent. These studies have shown that azelaic acid is a reversible inhibitor of tyrosinase and other oxidoreductases in vitro and that it inhibits mitochondrial respiration. It can also inhibit anaerobic glycolysis. Both in vitro and in vivo it has an antimicrobial effect on both aerobic and anaerobic (Propionibacterium acnes) microorganisms. In tissue culture it exerts a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect on malignant melanocytes, associated with mitochondrial damage and inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. Tumoral cell lines not containing tyrosinase are equally affected. Normal cells in culture exposed to the same concentrations of the diacid that are toxic for tumoral cells are in general not damaged. Radioactive azelaic acid has been shown to penetrate tumoral cells at a higher level than normal cells of the corresponding line. Topically applied (a 20% cream), it has been shown to be of therapeutic value in skin disorders of different etiologies. Its beneficial effect on various forms of acne (comedogenic, papulopustular, nodulocystic) has been clearly demonstrated. Particularly important is its action on abnormal melanocytes, which has led to the possibility of obtaining good results on melasma and highly durable therapeutic responses on lentigo maligna. It is also capable of causing regression of cutaneous malignant melanoma, but its role in melanoma therapy remains to be investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Absorbent gelling materials tightly hold water and provide pH control by a buffering capacity as well as by helping to segregate urine apart from feces. Four clinical studies were conducted with each following a rigid protocol that controlled for variables of diet and age in addition to the diaper material that may influence the development of diaper dermatitis and helped to control for any inherent bias in the study. This allowed for the controlled assessment of skin condition with respect to diaper type. Absorbent gelling material-containing disposable, conventional (100% cellulose core) disposable, and home-laundered cloth diapers were test products. In these studies 1614 infants were initially enrolled with 522 of them assigned to absorbent gelling material disposable, 738 to conventional disposable, and 354 to home-laundered cloth diapers. Objective measurements of skin wetness (transepidermal water loss) and skin pH, as well as double-blind grading of diaper dermatitis, were the measures of skin condition. Absorbent gelling material disposable diapers were associated with significantly reduced skin wetness, closer to normal skin pH, and lower degrees of diaper dermatitis when compared to conventional disposable or home-laundered cloth diapers. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that better control in the diaper area of skin wetness, skin pH, and the prevention of the mixing of urine and feces produces a better diaper environment.\r"

Infants with atopic dermatitis wearing conventional cellulose core diapers had statistically less rash at one of eight visits. There was no statistically significant difference between diaper types at three of the eight visits. At no time did the cloth group have less diaper rash than the conventional cellulose or absorbent gelling material disposable diaper group. A statistical correlation between the severity of general atopic dermatitis outside the diaper area and the diaper rash condition under the diaper occurred only in the atopic dermatitis group wearing cloth diapers. Isolation of microorganisms from the intact, uninvolved skin surface both inside and outside the diaper showed no biologically significant changes in the presence or numbers of selected skin organisms. Repeated isolation, at multiple grading visits of Staphylococcus aureus from uncompromised skin inside the diaper area was infrequent but correlated with the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis when observed.\r"

Is the rhythm regular or irregular? The most common narrow complex regular tachycardias are sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia that blocks, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Carotid sinus massage is useful in differentiation. Irregular narrow-complex tachycardias are usually atrial fibrillation. An ultra-rapid wide-complex or polymorphous irregular tachycardia is likely to be atrial fibrillation with ventricular preexcitation. Wide-complex regular tachycardias present a special challenge, since wide beats may result from supraventricular or ventricular impulse formation. Ventricular tachycardia is more likely than supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of underlying ischemic heart disease, atrioventricular dissociation, fusion or capture beats, or a very broad (greater than .14 seconds) QRS complex. Still, misdiagnosis is common; the most costly mistake is over-diagnosis of SVT. In emergencies, where vital organ hypoperfusion is present, the origin of the impulse and the name of the dysrhythmia are unimportant. With the exception of sinus tachycardia, all life-threatening, rapid tachycardias should be terminated by electrical cardioversion.\r"

Unlike the gauge system adopted by the British for measurement of needles and intravenous catheters, Charriere's system has uniform increments between gauge sizes (1/3 of a millimeter), is easily calculated in terms of its metric equivalent, and has no arbitrary upper end point. Today, in the United States, this system is commonly referred to as French (Fr) sizing. In addition to the development of the French gauge, Charriere made significant advances in ether administration, urologic, and other surgical instruments, and the development of the modern syringe.\r"

  ".W": "Disopyramide is an oral antiarrhythmic drug which reduces conduction velocity, prolongs duration of action potential and the effective refractory period, and exerts vagolytic properties. The drug is usually well absorbed orally. The principal use of the drug is to suppress ventricular extrasystoles with usual oral dosage of 100 to 200 mg every 6 h, until blood levels of 2 to 4 micrograms/mL are attained. The use of the drug for suicide is uncommon as it is a prescription drug. Two cases of fatal disopyramide intoxication seen at the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office will be discussed followed by a review of the literature of fatal suicidal disopyramide overdose. Case 1 was a 31-year-old male pharmacist with known history of depression and no history of heart disease. His decomposed remains were found with a suicide note and with several disopyramide tablets. At autopsy the blood level for disopyramide was 146 micrograms/mL. Case 2 is a 40-year-old male with history of alcoholism and prior suicidal attempts who regularly took disopyramide to control ventricular arrhythmias. He apparently ingested 36 100-mg tablets of disopyramide before his final collapse. At autopsy his blood level of disopyramide was 63 micrograms/mL.\r"

Physical examination, however, did not detect any goiters during the immediate postpartum period and did not identify a change in thyroid gland size six months after delivery. The thyroid gland enlargement that occurs during pregnancy is not large enough to be detected by physical examination. We urge physicians to discard the commonly held notion that goiter frequently develops during pregnancy.\r"

Significant findings in women with ectopic pregnancy were: (1) vaginal bleeding lasted longer, (2) abdominal rebound tenderness was more prevalent, and (3) abdominal pain was more prevalent in patients with ruptured ectopic pregnancy than in those with unruptured. There were no other significant differences among the signs and symptoms. Patients with and without ectopic pregnancy cannot be easily distinguished on the basis of presenting signs and symptoms. A combination of culdocentesis and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin provides the maximal discriminative capacity when considering diagnostic laparoscopy for suspected ectopic pregnancy.\r"

When normalized on the basis of thymocyte costimulatory activity, the beta (pI 7) form of recombinant IL-1 was about 5-fold more potent than the alpha (pI 5) species, although the maximum response induced by either IL-1 form was similar. Recombinant murine IL-1 was also a potent dose dependent activator of chondrocyte arachidonate metabolism and protease secretion. In contrast to IL-1, neither IL-2 nor tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) activated PLA2, PGE2, or neutral protease secretion in these cells and neither of these cytokines inhibited the chondrocyte metabolic response to IL-1. These results provide unequivocal evidence that IL-1 is a potent activator of chondrocyte arachidonate metabolism and hydrolytic protease secretion. That all 3 recombinant IL-1 molecules stimulate chondrocytes and yet share limited sequence homology suggests that an amino acid sequence common to all 3 species is required for chondrocyte activation.\r"

The thymus gland secretes factor(s), including thymosin beta 4, that affect the release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH regulates the subsequent release of luteinizing hormone, thereby affecting early ovarian development. Thymic factors may be modulated by gonadal steroids. Studies indicate that levels of thymosin beta 4 decrease in postmenopausal and ovariectomized women. In diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, abnormal patterns of estrogen metabolism may affect thymic function and contribute to the etiology of the disease.\r"

Ten percent of these (291 cases) were positive for either amphetamine alone or amphetamine in conjunction with methamphetamine--a substantial increase from the 3% noted in 1978 at this medical center. Amphetamines were detected predominantly in males (164 cases). The most common age range for the entire series was 21 to 30 years (61% of cases). The typical user was a 27 year old Caucasian man who used amphetamines alone or in combination with at least one other drug with about equal frequency. The sympathomimetic amines (ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, and pseudoephedrine) were the most frequently associated category of other drugs, perhaps reflecting either adulteration of the amphetamines with these compounds or concurrent ingestion of over-the-counter preparations containing these agents. Requests for those toxicology tests which subsequently revealed amphetamines mostly originated in the emergency room (30% of cases) although 25% originated on the trauma service and 17% on the obstetrics service. Twelve percent of cases occurred in neonates, presumably reflecting transplacental transmission of amphetamines detected in mothers that were studied simultaneously. Amphetamine and methamphetamine were detected together 84% of the time. Analysis of amphetamines should be an integral part of toxicology testing performed on a university medical center patient population.\r"

Insulin is important as well in fat metabolism, and \"resistance\" to insulin's effects on lipid metabolism after injury has been demonstrated. Although fat-derived fuels are the body's major energy source during starvation and after injury, most studies of posttraumatic insulin \"resistance\" have focused on carbohydrate metabolism. This study investigated adipose tissue response to insulin in vitro in rats subjected to starvation and/or trauma. Relationships between various parameters, including adipocyte size and weight, plasma glucose, insulin, and glycerol, and basal and insulin-suppressed lipolytic rates, were also studied. Results observed include a decrease in adipocyte size and an increase in basal lipolysis in both starved and traumatized rats, with both decreased sensitivity (T greater than S) and responsiveness (S greater than T) to insulin. These results support the concept that adipocytes of injured animals retain the ability to respond to insulin but lipolytic rates at maximal suppression are still quite high as compared to fed controls. Only minor differences were observed between starved animals and those with starvation and superimposed trauma.\r"

Although the transport of ammonia in a nontoxic form protects the brain against high circulating levels, the interorgan transport of this molecule and the orchestration between tissues that has evolved is related primarily to the fact that the nitrogen molecule is an essential molecule for the maintenance of the body's nutrition economy and overall metabolic homeostasis. Efficient handling and disposal of ammonia requires a cooperative effort between tissues in order to maintain nitrogen homeostasis. The liver is the central organ of ammonia metabolism, but other organs also play a key role in the interorgan exchange of this molecule. Alterations in ammonia metabolism occur during critical illness. These changes are adaptive and are designed to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Interorgan cooperation in ammonia metabolism is necessary to insure the proper integration of the metabolic processes which contribute to and are essential for survival during critical illness. An understanding of these processes improves our knowledge of metabolic regulation and will lead to a rational approach to the nutritional and metabolic support provided to critically ill patients.\r"

  ".W": "The relative contributions of three kininases to total urinary kininase activity were determined by measuring the hydrolysis of kinins in the presence and absence of inhibitors of kininase I (2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid; MGTA), kininase II (captopril) and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP or enkephalinase A; phosphoramidon). Surprisingly, NEP was responsible for 68 +/- 2% (N = 18) of the total kininase in the rat while kininase I and II contributed only 9 +/- 0.4% and 23 +/- 1%, respectively. To study the effects of NEP inhibition on renal function, phosphoramidon (110 or 330 micrograms/hr/kg; N = 6) or saline (0.1 microliter/min; N = 6) was infused into rats. Urinary kinins, kininases, renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), UNaV, UKV and UV were measured during control, experimental and recovery periods. Phosphoramidon at the higher dose decreased total urinary kininase activity from 284 +/- 49 to 58 +/- 5 ng/min/kg (77%, P less than 0.01), and increased kinin excretion from 74 +/- 9 to 128 +/- 21 pg/min/kg (73%, P less than 0.02), UV from 72 +/- 10 to 82 +/- 10 microliters/min/kg (15%, P less than 0.01) and UNaV from 12 +/- 2 to 17 +/- 3 microEq/min/kg (37%, P less than 0.02), while BP, RBF, GFR and UKV did not change. 125I-Tyr0-bradykinin infused into the aorta did not appear in the urine intact during simultaneous phosphoramidon and captopril administration. This is the first demonstration of NEP having a major role in the catabolism of kinins. The increase in UNaV and UV after phosphoramidon administration may be due to the inhibition of intrarenal kinin destruction.\r"

The normal control of 48.6 +/- 7.9 (mean +/- SD) glomerular nuclei on histologic section decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) to 39.8 +/- 6.1, 37.4 +/- 6.0, and 38.9 +/- 6.8 at one hour, four hours and two days after ATS administration, respectively.

By electron microscopy, glomerular damage in the lytic stage was restricted to mesangial cells and was manifested as hydropic degeneration or lysis. Rabbit IgG and rat C3 were found in the mesangium one hour after injection; they decreased at two days and were negligible at four days. By paired label isotope study, 11.6 micrograms of antibody bound per 7.6 X 10(4) glomeruli at one hour was needed to induce mesangial cell degeneration.

  ".W": "We examined the temporal dynamics of the correction of anemia following renal transplantation in 65 recipients using a sensitive radioimmunoassay for erythropoietin to determine the effects of modern immunosuppressive agents, delayed graft function, and early acute rejection. Pretransplant mean erythropoietin (25.6 +/- 3.3 mU/ml) was only 25% of the expected value at the mean hematocrit of 27.2 +/- 0.7, and erythropoietin correlated positively with hematocrit (r = 0.37, P less than 0.05). Following onset of graft function, erythropoietin increased to 109 +/- 13 mU/ml and then decreased in a negative feedback fashion over the next several months. Delayed graft function was associated with delay in the assumption of this orderly process irrespective of the immunosuppressive regimen used. Cyclosporine A produced a biphasic response despite delayed graft function in recipients with underlying adult polycystic kidney disease. Correction of anemia required resumption of graft function. Onset of acute graft rejection within the first month posttransplantation (14 episodes in 11 patients) abrogated the hematopoietic response until the rejection was successfully reversed. We conclude that a major cause for the anemia of renal failure is subnormal production of erythropoietin. Following transplantation, anemia corrects in an orderly manner with restoration of the normal biofeedback process between erythropoietin and red cell mass. This process is delayed by failure of graft to function initially and interrupted by acute early rejection, re-commencing following successful reversal.\r"

Twenty-six such patients were studied with serum creatinine concentrations exceeding 135 microM, and 24-hour urine protein excretion of at least 3.5 g/day to determine the potential benefit of cyclophosphamide therapy. Cyclophosphamide (mean 1.5 mg/kg/day) was given to nine patients for 23 +/- 4 months. These patients were compared with 17 concurrent controls. The two groups did not differ in clinical or laboratory features at the time of biopsy or start of treatment or its equivalent. Six of the nine cyclophosphamide treated patients and 15 of the 17 controls had received prednisone therapy. The total follow-up was 49 +/- 10 months in the treated group and 50 +/- 6 months in the controls. At last observation, serum creatinine values exceeded 400 microM in eight controls (4 on dialysis) and in none of the treated patients. The mean serum creatinine level was significantly lower (P less than 0.02) in the treated group (173 +/- 24 microM) than in controls (433 +/- 71 0.02) in the treated group (173 +/- 24 microM) than in controls (433 +/- 71 microM). The mean serum albumin level and 24-hour urine protein excretion both improved significantly with treatment as compared with controls. There were four complete remissions, five partial remissions and no patient with persistent nephrotic syndrome after treatment. In the controls, there were no complete remissions, six partial remissions and 11 patients had persistent nephrotic syndrome (P less than 0.001). Thus, cyclophosphamide therapy appears to be of benefit in patients with MGN, the nephrotic syndrome and impaired renal function.\r"

  ".W": "The mesangial changes in 92 renal biopsy specimens from 81 children with IgA nephropathy were correlated with the clinical and the other renal biopsy findings. Three types of mesangial changes were identified: mesangial hypercellularity was predominant compared with the increase in matrix in 34 biopsy specimens (type A), the degrees of mesangial hypercellularity and matrix increase were similar in 36 (type B) and matrix increase was predominant in 22 (type C). The interval between the onset of disease and biopsy was significantly shorter in biopsies with type A mesangial changes (P less than 0.01) and significantly longer in those with type C (P less than 0.01). Serial pathologic observations revealed that predominant mesangial hypercellularity was almost exclusively seen in the initial biopsy but predominant matrix increase was usually seen in the follow-up biopsy. The percentage of glomeruli showing sclerosis was significantly higher in biopsies with type C mesangial changes (P less than 0.05). At the latest follow-up, 58% of the patients showing type A and 57% showing type B lost their proteinuria, whereas only 9% showing type C lost their proteinuria (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that predominant mesangial hypercellularity is characteristic of the early lesion of childhood IgA nephropathy, and progression of disease leads to gradual decrease of mesangial cellularity and increase of matrix with sclerosis.\r"

The BN strain has a tubular basement membrane (TBM) antigen (Ag+) detectable by immunofluorescence which is lacking in unmodified LEW rat TBM. Development of TIN in LEW rats correlated with TBM Ag+ immunogens from homologous and heterologous RBM preparations. By day 14 after immunization TIN developed characterized by elevated serum creatinine levels and by tubular destruction with focal, circumscribed lesions containing epithelioid cells, giant cells and mononuclear cell infiltrates. Approximately 60% of the mononuclear cells bore T cell antigens with most cells expressing Ia markers. Immunofluorescence and elution studies revealed no selective IgG fixation to TBM at day 14 despite high titers of circulating alloantibody reactive with the immunizing TBM. Intravenous transfer of LNC and/or splenic cells (3.5 to 7 X 10(8)) to naive LEW rats resulted in less severe but histologically identical TIN in seven days with T cell subpopulations similar to those seen in the active model. This model strongly suggests an initiating role for cell-mediated immunity in TIN in the rat and may provide a parallel to human TIN.\r"

Immunohistochemical techniques included indirect immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of frozen tissue, immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence of fixed tissue embedded in Paraplast, and immunoelectron microscopy. The ACE distribution in the fetal kidneys was independent of the age of the fetus. ACE was detected in two locations: 1) on the basolateral membranes and primary apical microvilli of epithelial cells from early differentiating proximal tubules; the labeling was intense in brush borders of fully developed proximal tubules; and 2) on glomerular endothelial cells; cells were lined by reaction product as soon as capillaries invaded the inferior cleft of the S-shaped body. Tubular ACE distribution was identical in the postnatal kidneys. The staining of the glomerular endothelium was extremely inconstant. The presence of ACE in proximal tubular cells and glomerular endothelial cells at the beginning of nephron differentiation may indicate that it is involved in the development of nephron function and renal hemodynamic.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats, uninephrectomized three weeks before, received daily injections of subcutaneous AMNS (1 mg/100 g body wt) and intravenous PS (2 separated doses of 2.5 mg/100 g body wt) for four days. The series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day intervals. The animals were sacrificed on days 24, 52, and 80. They developed nephrotic syndrome and finally renal failure. The time-course curve of creatinine clearance dropped and showed significant difference (P less than 0.01) from that of each control group, such as, AMNS alone, PS alone or saline injected. Their glomeruli showed changes of progressive FSGS. The ultrastructural studies in the initial stage revealed significant lack of particles of perfused ruthenium red on the lamina rara externa and marked changes in epithelial cell cytoplasm. Therefore, it is suggested that the administration of PS enhances the toxicity of AMNS on the glomerulus and readily produces progressive FSGS in rats resulting in the end-stage renal disease.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen subjects with persistent azotemia and normal glomerular filtration rate were studied by renal clearances and hormonal determinations to establish the nephron site of altered urea transport and the mechanism(s) responsible for their azotemia. During constant alimentary protein, urea nitrogen appearance was normal and urea clearance was much lower than in 10 age-matched control subjects (23.3 +/- 2.1 ml/min and 49.6 +/- 2.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2, P less than 0.001). Inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances, blood volume and plasma concentration of antidiuretic hormone were within normal limits. During maximal antidiuresis, in spite of greater urea filtered load, the urinary excretion of urea was less, and both the maximum urinary osmolality and the free-water reabsorption relative to osmolar clearance per unit of GFR were greater than in control subjects. After sustained water diuresis, the plasma urea concentration markedly decreased to near normal levels in azotemic subjects. The basal urinary excretion of prostaglandins E2 was significantly reduced in azotemic subjects and was directly correlated with fractional urea clearance (r = 0.857, P less than 0.001). An additional group of control subjects (N = 8) showed a marked reduction of fractional clearance of urea after inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (P less than 0.01). These data suggest that azotemia is due to increased tubular reabsorption of urea in the distal part of nephron, presumably because of increased back diffusion in the papillary collecting duct, accounting for the enhanced maximum urinary osmolality and free-water reabsorption. Renal prostaglandin E2 may participate in the pathogenesis of azotemia by altering recycling of urea in the medulla.\r"

In group A, treated with CAP for four to five weeks after UN, a reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), filtration fraction and glomerular volumes was found as compared to control group B. Long-term treatment with CAP for eight months after UN (group C) resulted in lowering of SBP with 30 mm Hg, a low level of proteinuria and low incidence of GS (0 to 1.5%) as compared to control rats (group D), with SBP of 131 +/- 4 mm Hg, proteinuria up to 103 to 509 mg/day and 9.1 to 29.7% GS at eight months after UN. Groups E and F were followed without therapy up to seven months after UN, at which time a high level of proteinuria was present. CAP therapy then started in group E, did not reduce SBP, proteinuria and GS at 11 months after UN relative to control group F. This study shows that early CEI prevents progressive proteinuria and GS in rats after UN and is associated with a reduction in SBP, filtration fraction and glomerular volume. Once high levels of proteinuria and GS have developed in rats after UN, CEI has no effect on SBP nor on the progression of GS and proteinuria.\r"

The present studies examine the effect of CP on ADH-stimulated Pf in isolated, perfused rabbit cortical collecting tubules (CCT). CP (10(-4) M) reversibly inhibited Pf, stimulated by maximal concentrations of ADH (10 microU/ml). Pretreatment of CCT's with 5 microM indomethacin, however, abolished the effect of CP. Inhibition of BK production by the kallikrein inhibitors, aprotinin and benzamidine, failed to enhance Pf stimulated by submaximal concentrations of ADH (2.5 microU/ml). Since ADH exerts its effects by activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), further experiments were performed to identify the site at which CP inhibits this cascade. CP significantly inhibited forskolin (10(-4) M) stimulated Pf; however, it had no effect on cyclic AMP (10(-5) M) stimulated Pf, suggesting that the site of action is on the catalytic subunit or one of the GTP regulatory proteins of AC. To further localize the site of CP's action, CCT's were pre-incubated with pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram/ml) to inactivate the inhibitory, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) regulatory protein, Gi. In these tubules, CP failed to inhibit the action of ADH. We conclude that CP stimulates prostaglandin production which in turn activates Gi and inhibits AC activity. We further suggest that CP stimulates PG's directly, not via BK.\r"

The fasting plasma glucose concentration and basal rates of hepatic glucose production (HGP) and tissue glucose disappearance (Rd) were similar in control and uremic subjects. In both groups HGP and Rd increased in parallel during exercise, and the plasma glucose concentration remained constant at the fasting level. However, the increments in Rd (2.27 +/- 0.27 vs. 0.87 +/- 0.31 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01) and HGP (2.47 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.19 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01) were 2.5-3 fold greater in the control compared to uremic subjects. Although the VO2max was decreased by 50% (39 +/- 2 vs. 20 +/- 2 ml/min.kg; P less than 0.01), the correlation between Rd and VO2max was weak (r = 0.33, P less than 0.10), suggesting that factors other than diminished physical fitness contribute to diminished tissue uptake of glucose in the dialyzed uremic patients. Following the cessation of exercise, HGP and Rd promptly returned toward basal levels in both uremic and control subjects. The glucose homeostatic response to exercise was not significantly altered by either propranolol or metoprolol. In the postabsorptive state fasting levels of insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, and norepinephrine all were significantly increased in the uremic group (P less than 0.01 to 0.05). During exercise in the healthy young controls the plasma insulin concentration declined and plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels rose three- to fourfold. In contrast, in uremics plasma insulin failed to fall (P less than 0.05) and the increase in circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine levels was markedly impaired (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In view of the reported increase in thromboembolic episodes following cyclosporine A (CyA) therapy, the effect of this drug on platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 release was investigated. The addition of CyA, at therapeutic concentrations to platelet rich plasma from normal subjects in vitro was found to increase aggregation in response to adrenaline, collagen and ADP. Ingestion of CyA by healthy volunteers was also associated with enhanced platelet aggregation. The CyA-mediated enhancement of aggregation was further enhanced by the addition in vitro of therapeutic concentrations of heparin. Platelets from renal allograft recipients treated with CyA also showed hyperaggregability and increased thromboxane A2 release, which were most marked at \"peak\" plasma CyA concentration and less so at \"trough\" concentrations. Platelet hyperaggregability in renal allograft patients on long-term CyA therapy tended to revert towards normal following the replacement of CyA with azathioprine. Hypertensive patients with renal allografts on nifedipine therapy had normal platelet function and thromboxane release in spite of CyA therapy. These observations suggest that CyA-mediated platelet activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of the thromboembolic phenomena associated with the use of this drug. The increased release of thromboxane A2 (a vasoconstrictor) may also play a role in mediating CyA-related nephrotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Our results as well as those in the literature suggest that some hormone or combination of hormones, that are inhibited by somatostatin, is responsible for the hyperfiltration response following amino acid infusion/protein ingestion. Recently, we have infused amino acids with somatostatin and replaced the stimulated levels of insulin/glucagon/growth hormone observed during amino acid infusion alone (Castellino and DeFronzo, preliminary results). This combined hormone replacement was able to overcome the inhibitory effect of somatostatin and return the increase in RPF and GFR to the elevated levels observed following amino acid infusion. These results suggest that some combination of these hormones is involved in the hyperfiltration response to hyperaminoacidemia. However, several comments are worthy of emphasis. First, somatostatin is known to inhibit a number of hormones (Table 1), and a contributory role for any of these should not be excluded. Second, a large body of evidence has accumulated to indicate that neither insulin, glucagon, nor growth hormone alone are capable of augmenting either RPF or GFR. The possibility that infusion of the three hormones together will increase RPF and GFR, when neither hormone alone will do so, has not been examined. More likely, some interaction between the elevated plasma amino acid concentrations and the elevated hormone levels is responsible for the hyperfiltration response. It is interesting to speculate that such an interaction might be exerted at the level of the kidney by an effect on renal amino acid metabolism.\r"

(2) These factors, in turn, lead to increased renal sodium retention and stimulation of the renin-aldosterone system which, in turn, leads to: (3) An increased cardiac output with an inability to appropriately adjust the peripheral resistance to maintain normotension with resultant hypertension. Conversely, the fall in blood pressure with weight reduction can be explained by (Fig. 3): (1) A decrease in calorie, carbohydrate, or protein intake which leads to: (2) A decrease in circulating plasma catecholamines, sympathetic nervous system activity, and insulin secretion which results in: (3) A natriuresis and decrease in the renin-aldosterone system, which causes a decrease in circulating blood volume and in cardiac output. This, in turn, lowers blood pressure towards normal. The unanswered question still remains: why do some obese patients become hypertensive and others remain normotensive? Perhaps there are weight-sensitive individuals and weight-resistant individuals just as there appear to be salt-sensitive and salt-resistant hypertensive patients. Perhaps the answer is genetic. These questions also remain to be answered.\r"

  ".W": "There is accumulating evidence showing alterations of renal eicosanoid synthesis in glomerular disease. Despite the complexity of their role in glomerulonephritis, these compounds appear to play a major part in the inflammatory response and in control of renal hemodynamics. The role of eicosanoids in the filtration of macromolecules has not been established, but there is indirect evidence of their involvement in mediating proteinuria. Dietary manipulation, either by high EPA, high linoleic acid, or EFA-deficient diet, in experimental glomerulonephritis have shown promising results as summarized in Table 1. The therapeutic potential of alterations in dietary fatty acid to modulate the inflammatory response appears to be of great value. Table 2 summarizes the effects of different dietary fatty acid alterations on eicosanoid synthesis. Nonetheless, we should point out that most of the studies of alterations in dietary fatty acids did not document changes in glomerular synthesis of prostaglandin, thromboxane, or HETES. Further studies examining the effects of different fatty acid regimens on glomerular eicosanoid synthesis and the role of these eicosanoids in the development of glomerulonephritis will provide valuable information. These findings could determine the specific type of dietary manipulation to inhibit or stimulate the production of selected eicosanoids.\r"

Bursting pressure of the laser welded enterotomies was compared to the bursting pressure of traditional two-layer, inverting, interrupted sutured bowel anastomoses. The overall mean bursting pressure of non-contact-welded enterotomies was 50.6 mmHg. Optimal laser settings determined in this initial phase were then used to produce anastomoses in rabbits which are recovered postoperatively for 1 or 2 weeks in order to examine long-term viability and integrity of the anastomoses. All chronic rabbit preparations recovered without complication. The mean bursting pressure was 200 mmHg, not significantly different from that of uncut bowel or two-layer sutured anastomosis.\r"

This paper reviews the literature on these factors with special emphasis on athletes who show large, frequent, and rapid fluctuations in weight (wrestlers) and athletes who maintain low weight and low percent body fat (e.g., distance runners, gymnasts, and figure skaters). A theory is presented which relates these weight patterns and the accompanying dietary habits to changes in body composition, metabolism, metabolic activity of adipose tissue, and the distribution of body fat. Changes in these physiological variables may be manifested in enhanced food efficiency (weight as a function of caloric intake) as the body seeks to protect and replenish its energy stores. This may explain the surprisingly low caloric intakes of some athletes. The health status of the athlete is a concern in this regard because there may be changes in fat distribution, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and hormonal factors associated with reproductive functioning in both females and males. Amenorrhea in female athletes may be mediated at least in part by regional fat distribution; depletion of femoral fat depots (lactational energy reserves) may be the stimulus for cessation or disruption of menses.\r"

Compared to rest, plasma beta-endorphins were not significantly elevated during the 40 and 60% workloads (4.8 +/- 1.0 pmol.l-1 vs 3.8 +/- 0.7 and 6.3 +/- 0.9, respectively). In contrast, the 80% exercise significantly elevated endorphins to 16.1 +/- 4.0 pmol.l-1. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were 0.30 +/- 0.04 ng.ml-1 at rest and increased with exercise intensity (40% = 0.60 +/- 0.05, 60% = 0.93 +/- 0.07, 80% = 2.00 +/- 0.14, VO2max = 2.55 +/- 0.14 ng.ml-1). Plasma epinephrine followed the same trend (rest = 0.07 +/- 0.01, 40% = 0.33 +/- 0.03, 60% = 0.49 +/- 0.02, 80% = 0.88 +/- 0.07, VO2max = 0.95 +/- 0.06 ng.ml-1). Norepinephrine was found to significantly correlate to endorphins (r = 0.499; P less than 0.02). Conversely, epinephrine was not correlated with beta-endorphin (r = 0.309; P greater than 0.05). The low correlation suggests a weak relationship between beta-endorphin and catecholamine responses during exercise. The results of this investigation suggest that the relationship between beta-endorphin and exercise intensity is curvilinear, with anaerobic activity producing the most significant endorphin response. It was also noted that the beta-endorphin response was not related to gender, but the amine response to exercise was gender-related, being greater for the men.\r"

Four pregnant women (26 to 30 yr, means = 28, gestational age = 28 to 34 wk) pedaled a cycle ergometer at 25 to 50 W, while a second group (N = 4) (24 to 36 yr, means = 29, gestational age = 30 to 37 wk) walked on a treadmill at either 1.5 or 2.0 mph. Fetal monitor recordings (Hewlett-Packard 8040A) were consistent with pedal rate in the range of 50 to 70 rpm and with stepping rate in the range of 70 to 76 steps per min at 1.5 mph and 100 to 106 steps per min at 2.0 mph on the treadmill. Actual mean FHRs (audible signal from fetal monitor) were in the normal range [150.5 +/- 10.25 bpm (cycle ergometer) and 148.8 +/- 2.3 bpm (treadmill)]. In a separate session, the cycle ergometer group walked on a treadmill at a maternal heart rate of 140 bpm while FHR was determined by two-dimensional ultrasound directed M-mode echocardiographs. Off-line analysis of fetal cardiac cycle time (clinical graphics analyzer) allowed accurate FHR measurements which were not confounded by motion artifact. Mean FHR during maternal treadmill exercise (158.0 +/- 12.0 bpm) was not different (P greater than 0.05) when compared to pre-exercise standing (140 +/- 3.6) and also during the post-exercise period (sitting) (151 +/- 6.5) compared to the sitting pre-exercise measurements (147 +/- 8.2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The term spasticity is used to describe many relatively unrelated syndromes and, because they share few common pathophysiologic mechanisms, it is not possible to define the physiology or pharmacology of spasticity. In patients with spastic paresis, it is the latter negative symptom (rather than the spasticity) that accounts for almost all the functional disability. Clinical neurophysiologic techniques are useful for categorization of patients with clinically identical syndromes into subgroups which respond to different therapies. Fusimotor or spindle primary afferent hyperactivity have not been demonstrated in spastic patients; reduction in central inhibitory mechanisms probably accounts for spastic hyper-reflexia. Increased passive muscle stiffness may also be clinically significant. Therapies for spasticity include elimination of causative or enhancing factors, frequent muscle stretching, surgical approaches and chemotherapy. The latter includes dantrolene (which weakens muscles), baclofen (particularly useful for reduction of flexor spasms and flexor dystonia in patients with spinal lesions) and diazepam.\r"

Most cancers appear to have a multifactorial etiology, and HPV infection alone is probably insufficient for malignant transformation. However, the consistent association between HPV infection and anogenital cancers emphasizes that the sexually transmitted papillomaviruses may have a necessary role in carcinogenesis. Hence, there is a prospect that vaccination programs may one day allow public health control of HPV infection, thereby eliminating an important risk factor.\r"

  ".W": "Human papillomaviruses are a heterogeneous group of DNA tumor viruses associated with hyperplastic (warts, condylomas), dysplastic (CIN and VIN), and malignant lesions (carcinomas) of squamous epithelium. Each HPV type is preferentially associated with specific clinical lesions and has an anatomic site preference for either cutaneous or mucosal squamous epithelium. Infection appears to begin in the basal cells. Early gene expression is associated with acanthosis, and late gene expression is associated with appearance of structural antigens and virions in nuclei of cells of the granular layer, usually koilocytotic cells. Malignant transformation of warts and papillomas appears to be related to a variety of factors: (1) infection by certain HPV types (HPV-5, HPV-8, HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31); (2) decreased cellular immunity to HPV-associated antigens; and (3) interaction with cofactors, such as other microorganisms or sunlight (see also the article by Kashima and Shah). Spontaneous regression or successful treatment of the benign lesions appears to depend on either naturally acquired or iatrogenically related stimulation of HPV type-specific immunity. The humoral antibody response to HPV particles may be important in preventing infection. In contrast, the local events surrounding regression of warts and condylomas are primarily associated with specific cell-mediated immunity. Local cell-mediated immune responses, particularly cell-associated soluble mediators and stationary macrophage-like cells, may be especially important in the host's immune response to mucosal infections.\r"

In essence, the triage of the abnormal Papanicolaou smear amounts to the differentiation between benign warty proliferation, minor-grade dysplasia, and full-thickness intraepithelial neoplasia. Hence, a clear understanding of the morphologic expression and natural history of different types of HPV infection is now essential to the rational management of patients with lower genital tract neoplasia.\r"

Since the primary diagnosis of this condition is almost invariably based on cytologic observations, the diagnostic criteria are of paramount importance. The diagnosis is usually based on the presence of koilocytes, or balloon cells, and dyskeratotic cells. Although these cells remain fundamental to the diagnosis, it is important to recognize other possible cytologic manifestations of the disease. Follow-up studies indicate clearly that any woman with cytologic evidence of HPV infection has a greatly increased risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Morphologic attempts to quantify this risk are unreliable. The studies described and quoted in this paper would suggest that all women with the cytologic changes of HPV infection, with or without evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, should be managed with extreme caution.\r"

There are many alternative hybridization test formats; most of them use either filters or glass slides as solid supports. Of the established tests, Southern blot hybridization remains the most sensitive and specific test for HPV DNA but has the drawback of also being the most time consuming. Several novel methods show promise, and some innovative procedure may eventually dominate routine nucleic acid detection. The ideal test would be simple enough to permit automation.\r"

Anogenital neoplasms show a strong association with HPV infection and also persist, extend, and progress, in spite of standard therapy. Since standard therapy of anogenital HPV infection and neoplasia is often not effective in immunodeficient patients (and others with an anogenital neoplastic syndrome), special treatment is required. 5-Fluorouracil chemosurgery, followed by maintenance 5-fluorouracil therapy, is effective and provides field suppression against recurrent HPV infection and neoplasia, with minimal damage to affected organs. After removal of all detectable HPV infection or neoplastic lesions, immunodeficient patients require close surveillance of the entire anogenital tract. Immunodeficient patients are an in-vivo human laboratory in which to study the natural history of HPV and its oncogenic effects on the anogenital tract. The theory of HPV oncogenesis is supported by the evidence gathered from these patients.\r"

  ".W": "HPV infections of the female genital tract are common. The association of these viruses with anogenital neoplasia has stimulated efforts to devise practical methods of detection and typing of HPV. Although experimental diagnostic tests are available, they are, for the most part, complex and time consuming and are limited to medical centers researching HPV. New methods for preparing probes with higher sensitivities for hybridization tests will allow use of in-situ methods on formalin-fixed tissues and will probably be the method of choice. Antigen detection systems are not available except for antisera directed against the common structural antigens. The most useful immunologic test will be directed toward detection of nonstructural antigens in fixed tissues; such a system could also be useful for virus typing. Therapies based on use of these antigens to stimulate the immune system may be applicable as an alternative to current therapies. Most intriguing are the prospects for a vaccine based on either structural or nonstructural viral antigens. It has been estimated that as many as 20 per cent of female cancer deaths worldwide are associated with HPV. Thus, use of an effective vaccine would relieve considerable human suffering. However, until the host immune response to HPV infection is better defined, much of the effort dedicated to developing a vaccine may be futile.\r"

Despite trends toward bottle feeding in the 1950s and 1960s, the value of breast feeding is being rediscovered, because it is nutritionally ideal and now fashionable to connect pregnancy and the puerperium with being as \"natural\" as possible. Nursing normally begins shortly after delivery. This enhances the mother-infant relationship in terms of bonding, and it also stimulates mature milk production. The duration of the nursing period is widely variable, even within cultures. Dietary precautions should ensure adequate maternal dietary intake during breast feeding and should include avoidance of nonessential medications. With proper care and concern, nursing must be considered the ideal form of nutrition for the newborn human.\r"

We discussed the choice of procedure in certain clinical situations and have made suggestions. Of the imaging methods, x-ray mammography is the most useful. Ultrasound is the next most useful; however, it is not acceptable for screening. The basis for breast cancer detection and diagnosis remains palpation and x-ray mammography. Ultrasound makes a substantial contribution to the diagnostic evaluation of certain lesions. Eventually, biopsy or surgery provides the final answer in those patients with possible lesions after these diagnostic procedures. In view of the high incidence of breast carcinoma, it would be useful for the practitioner dealing with these problems to establish for his practice a standard operating procedure for examination and referral of patients for breast screening and diagnosis as well as a system of follow-up to prevent patients from avoiding the screening and diagnostic process.\r"

Excisional biopsy of the breast lump and associated axillary dissection are required prior to initiation of radiation therapy in order to remove all known tumor and to reduce the dose of radiation required for cure. The axillary dissection is therapeutic for extension into the axillary volume as well as a prognosticator that aids in the selection of patients for adjuvant systemic therapy. Although certain patients may be adequately served without radiation therapy by excisional removal of the tumor and a margin of surrounding normal breast tissue, this population still needs to be defined. Adequate patient selection and the use of good surgical and radiation therapy techniques results in good to excellent cosmesis in 80 to 90 per cent of treated patients. The treatment alternatives, if presented to patients deemed as appropriate candidates, will aid the patients in making an informed consent decision. Wider application and availability of this alternative to mastectomy may have a significant positive impact on our female population by encouraging women to seek detection of breast cancer through breast self-examination and mammography because the desirable alternative reduces the fear of loss of the breast and self image.\r"

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease whose biologic behavior is reflected by a variety of prognostic variables. The treatment of advanced breast cancer is still palliative; however, worthwhile complete and partial responses are obtained by using the multimodal therapeutic approach.\r"

There are tools to help ascertain psychosocial information from patients, and there are agencies that would be willing to conduct psychosocial work-ups for physicians and teach these significant psychosocial concepts. There are many innovative and creative group practices that now employ their own behavioral personnel to assist in a humanistic evaluation of the patient. Recently, Boyd demonstrated through her research projects how one might want to consider approaching women with patient education and treatment of breast disease. The inventory she uses to ascertain both mental and physical characteristics that might place a woman at risk for breast disease is superb and highly recommended. Another paradigm to consider would be Bartlett's \"Behavioral Diagnosis,\" a practical approach to patient education. These are but two of countless others one might want to consider. And finally, the \"Cancer Inventory of Problem Situations\" can also be a very useful tool. This is only a cursory view of the complexities one encounters when attempting to understand women, how and why they behave the way they do, how they respond to the health care system, what some of their influences are, and what we must all do together to help them help themselves and us, to provide them with a longer, more productive, rewarding and healthy life span. We have addressed patient education and how physicians might want to embark upon a sound enlightenment program for their patients by enhancing their communication skills and paying strict attention to the patient's psychosocial history as well as their own psychosocial orientation.\r"

  ".W": "When the Q-switched neodymium: YAG (Nd: YAG) laser is focused through the Wise 103-diopter (D) iridotomy-sphincterotomy lens (103-D lens) at low energy levels, the peripheral iris fibers can be cut individually across the iris tension lines to produce large iridotomies of controllable size. Thirty patients had linear-incision Nd:YAG laser iridotomy in one eye and linear-incision argon laser iridotomy in the other. Two-hour post-laser IOP rises averaged 7.33 mmHg for the Nd:YAG laser and 8.64 mmHg for the argon laser. The argon laser produced lens burns in 9 of 30 eyes, including 7 of 9 blue eyes. No lens damage occurred with the Nd:YAG laser. No corneal or retinal damage was seen with either laser. Local oozing of blood inhibited optical breakdown and required a pause before completion in 5 of 30 eyes with Nd:YAG iridotomy, including 4 of 6 dark brown thick irides. Because the iris fibers must be cut by direct contact with the laser plasma, serial cutting of iris fibers by multiple low-energy plasmas is safer than a single-shot, high-power plasma occupying the full thickness of the iris. Because it is effective and because it avoids the hazards of argon laser iridotomy and of high-power Nd:YAG laser iridotomy, linear incision Nd:YAG laser iridotomy is recommended as the safest method of iridotomy.\r"

At normoglycemia, Q was 15% lower than at hyperglycemia (P less than 0.001). The decrease in Q was larger in patients with shorter disease duration. The authors also determined the regulatory change in Q during 100% oxygen breathing. Although this response remained subnormal, it was improved significantly in normoglycemia (P less than 0.01), particularly in those patients whose blood glucose level was decreased at a slower rate, suggesting that a gradual decrease in blood glucose may be beneficial.\r"

We studied prospectively 74 pediatric patients with community-acquired serious infections and used once daily intramuscular ceftriaxone. Seventeen patients (23%) were initially hospitalized and 57 (77%) patients were treated entirely as outpatients. An initial intramuscular dose of 75 mg/kg was followed by daily doses of 50 mg/kg (maximum, 1.5 g). Infections treated included periorbital/buccal cellulitis, other cellulitis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, mastoiditis, suppurative arthritis and orbital cellulitis. Organisms were recovered from cultures of 37 (50%) patients and 6 (8%) patients were bacteremic. Bacteria included Gram-positive (mostly Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (mostly enteric bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae organisms). No serious side effects were observed. Of 74 patients 72 (97%) were cured and improvement was usually observed within 24 hours. Two patients did not improve: one with chronic Pseudomonas mastoiditis; and one with lung abscess. Based on previous experience it is estimated that 376 hospitalization days were saved. All 72 successfully treated patients and their parents resumed normal activity within 72 hours of starting therapy. Our data suggest that ceftriaxone can be used for outpatient treatment of some infectious diseases.\r"

Patients ranged in age from 1 year to 12 years, 1 month (mean, 5 years, 7 months). All patients were black and 23 (77%) were female. (The racial composition of our clinic population is 45% black, 18% Latin American, 34% Caucasian and 3% Asian.) Fungus cultures were positive in all but one patient and Trichophyton tonsurans was isolated from 26 of 30 (87%) of the pretreatment hair cultures. Direct microscopic examinations of KOH-treated hair samples were negative in 13 of 29 (43%) culture-positive patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intralesional steroid injection (2.5 mg) and griseofulvin (14 patients) or griseofulvin only (16 patients). The treatment groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, duration of lesions before treatment and type of lesions. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in the time to negative culture, time of onset of new hair growth, complete regrowth of hair and time to scalp clearing. We conclude that intralesional injection of corticosteroid is an unnecessary adjunct to therapy for patients with tinea capitis with kerion.\r"

All patients were given acetaminophen, 15 mg/kg, and their temperatures were rechecked at 1 hour. Laboratory tests were ordered at the discretion of the examining physician and usually included viral and bacterial cultures and total white blood cell counts. Sixteen patients had proved viral illnesses and 17 patients had serious bacterial infections. There was a significant difference (P less than 0.02) in the white blood cell count between the two groups, with the higher values in patients with bacterial infections. There was, however, no significant difference in the fever response to acetaminophen between the two groups (P = 0.37). The remaining 67 patients were then placed into one of the two groups based on their clinical illness and outcome. The mean temperature change was then calculated between the two groups, and again the difference was found to be statistically insignificant (P = not significant (t = 0.19]. We conclude that there is no correlation between a child's fever response to acetaminophen and the etiology of the fever.\r"

The sensitivity of the antigen test was designated as 0.95 if the growth of rare or few Group A streptococci on throat culture was discounted and 0.82 if any growth was considered significant, and the specificity was set at 0.98. In a standardized pediatric case with a prior probability of Group A streptococcal disease of 0.58, 84% of clinicians would order a 20-minute test and 39% would order a 4-hour test. The 20-minute test would reduce throat culture use by 54%, reduce the proportion of patients exposed to antibiotics from 86% to 65% and reduce total antibiotic treatment days by 13.8%. Effects would be less pronounced for a low probability case or if results of antigen testing were not available for 4 hours. Provided a test with a documented high sensitivity and specificity were used, a rapid antigen test with results promptly available would substantially reduce throat culture use and unnecessary antibiotic exposures in children with a moderate prior probability of streptococcal disease.\r"

Most persons with GAD are seen by primary care physicians, but recognizing these patients may be difficult. In the primary care setting they often present with physical complaints suggesting a specific organ system disease. Depression and substance abuse may be presenting problems in patients with primary GAD. Primary care physicians are usually able to provide appropriate care for generalized anxiety disorder patients. By keeping in mind the cognitive, behavioral, affective, and physiologic aspects of the syndrome, they can appropriately address the specific therapeutic needs of individual patients. The nature of the doctor-patient relationship in primary care favors the development of therapeutic trust that is important for effective management of GAD. Drug therapy is a useful adjunct in the treatment of many patients with GAD. However, the use of drugs as the sole therapeutic modality is seldom appropriate.\r"

It is commonly associated with conduct disorders and learning disabilities. The etiology of ADD is unknown, but family and adoption studies demonstrate an important role for genetic transmission. Pre- or postnatal central nervous system damage is suggested in only a few cases. Animal models as well as pharmacologic and clinical studies point to abnormalities in the catecholamine system, particularly dopamine function. Although certain psychometric tests are suggestive, no single laboratory marker is specific to ADD, and information from several sources is usually necessary before reaching the diagnosis. These sources may include parents, teachers, and pediatric psychology consultation, as well as clinical interview and physical examination. Children with ADD often suffer ridicule or rejection from family members, teachers, and peers. Treatment may interrupt the cycle of negative reinforcement that can have devastating effects on the self and public image of the child. Educational and behavioral management are the first line of intervention. Pharmacotherapy is also often helpful with stimulants considered the drugs of choice. Methylphenidate may be administered at a dose of 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg in the morning. This dose may be repeated at noon. D-amphetamine at approximately half this dose is usually equally effective. Other medications such as the antidepressants and clonidine have proven to be effective in the treatment of ADD and may play a role in the management of some children.\r"

  ".W": "American forensic medicine is forever indebted to pioneers like George Magrath of Boston, Milton Helpern of New York, LeMoyne Snyder of Michigan, and others, but the organizing of forensic medicine in the formal sense is due to the efforts of Charles Norris (Figure 1) and his successor Thomas A. Gonzales (Figure 2). These men were instrumental in developing the subspecialty as an extension of clinical medicine in which information derived from study of the dead was applied to benefit the living. Their combined efforts between 1918 and 1954 represent the epitome of the application of scientific expertise to medicolegal investigation of deaths in America. Their collaboration from 1918 to 1935 was particularly fruitful. The support of Dr. Alexander Gettler and, in 1938, the addition of Dr. Wiener to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner made this period a golden era for forensic medicine.\r"

  ".W": "The British medicolegal system, which today is largely based on the Coroner's Act of 1887, developed slowly, beginning with the election of county coroners in the 12th century. The duties of the medieval coroner included the collection of revenues due to the Crown, recordkeeping, presiding over inquests, and overseeing juries in cases of sudden or unnatural death. However, by the 14th century, the influence of the coroner had diminished and the office fell into disrepute. The practice of forensic medicine in the United Kingdom can be dated from the 17th century, when the first autopsy was recorded. However, the first original textbook on this subject did not appear in Britain until the early 19th century. Around the same time, due to a wave of homicidal poisonings, toxicology emerged as an important discipline. A number of historical cases of homicidal poisoning, as well as several cases of homicide by external wounding, are discussed herein. In the present day, with the passage of various laws, the British coroner deals only with sudden and unnatural death and treasure trove.\r"

Findings in the hemiplegic group include: 1) increase in the proportion of the gait cycle spent in stance and double-limb support phases in both the normal and affected limb; 2) consistent deviation from normal gait pattern by observation and objective pattern analysis; 3) abnormal phasic activity of specific muscles and muscle groups in the affected limb; and 4) a consistent electrogoniometric deviation from normal joint ankle progression in the affected hip, knee and ankle. These data lend credence to the hypothesis that gait deviation in adult acquired hemiplegia follows a consistent pattern varying with the severity of central nervous system involvement. These data also provide a baseline from which to measure therapeutic intervention in this complex patient population.\r"

In addition, unusual findings, seen in the post-poliomyelitis period, have been presented to further increase awareness of the potential diversity of the problem. The scope of PM sequelae is broad. Following a description of acute PM, the various sequelae are addressed categorically. These include neurologic, vascular, orthopedic, respiratory, sleep and psychologic problems; as well as less commonly recognized maladies. Different theories for PM sequelae have been proposed. Thorough electrodiagnostic testing can frequently confirm or negate the clinical impression. The pathophysiology of vascular problems, as well as the correlation between respiratory involvement, sleep disorders, and hypertension, is reviewed. Orthopedic problems and spinal deformities are discussed. Since overuse weakness is frequently present in these patients, the role of slowly progressive non-fatiguing exercise in their rehabilitation is emphasized. Of significance are the emotional concerns demonstrated by this group of patients. Further considerations include those sequelae not readily recognized in relation to PM. A brief overview of present epidemiologic trends in the United States, and the immunologic effects of vaccination, is presented.\r"

Simultaneous recordings of the intramuscular and surface EMG signals were made during both types of contractions with the elbow joint angle varying from 30 to 150 degrees in reference to a fully extended position. Results demonstrated that r.m.s. amplitude and mean power frequency of the surface EMG were significantly higher during CC, particularly at shorter muscle length; e.g., 259 vs. 131 microV (p less than 0.01) and 102 vs. 91 Hz (p less than 0.05). The intramuscular spike recordings made at 45, 90 and 135 degrees showed greater motor unit (MU) activities during CC along with the presence of MUs with relatively large spike amplitude. The pooled data on the ISAF histograms revealed significantly greater mean MU spike amplitude and frequency during CC as compared to EC; e.g., 439 vs. 108 microV and 16.1 vs. 13.0 Hz at 135 degrees, respectively. These data suggest that EC is associated with much less pronounced MU recruitment and rate modulation due to economical tension development which might be a result of better utilization of elastic energy, particularly those inherent in the actin-myosin cross bridges and also a favorable length-tension relationship under the present experimental conditions.\r"

Women were tested during the early follicular, ovulatory, and midluteal phases of the cycle, and men were administered alcohol at comparable time intervals. Results showed that men did not differ in alcohol pharmacokinetics across sessions, but women showed significantly shorter elimination times and faster disappearance rates during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle compared to the early follicular and ovulatory phases and to their male counterparts. There were no sex or within-group differences in self-reported negative mood states prior to alcohol administration, but women described increased anxiety and depression while intoxicated during the early follicular compared to ovulatory and midluteal phases. Affective responses to intoxication were a complex function of sex, limb of the blood alcohol concentration-time curve, and dose.\r"

  ".U": "88131664\r", 
  ".W": "The role of peripherally and centrally acting acetaldehyde in ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) was investigated using various enzyme manipulations. Cyanamide, an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor (ALDH) elevates blood acetaldehyde levels in the presence of ethanol. Concurrent administration with 4-methylpyrazole (4MP), an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, prevents peripheral accumulation of acetaldehyde by cyanamide. Under both treatment conditions brain and liver ALDH activity is inhibited. Water-deprived rats were pretreated 4 hr prior to fluid presentation with intraperitoneal injections of saline (S+S), 4-methylpyrazole (4MP+S), cyanamide (S+C), or 4-methylpyrazole + cyanamide (4MP+C). Subsequently, animals were presented with a novel saccharin solution followed immediately by intraperitoneal injection of one of three doses of ethanol (0.4, 0.8, or 1.2 g/kg) or saline vehicle on four occasions. Results suggested that animals pretreated with cyanamide (groups S+C and 4MP+C) drank significantly less saccharin after conditioning with a subthreshold dose of ethanol (0.4 g/kg) in comparison to groups S+S and 4MP+S. Moreover, at the conditioning dose of 1.2 g/kg, cyanamide-treated animals demonstrated an attenuation of CTA compared to the other two groups. These effects cannot be attributed to elevated blood acetaldehyde levels since pretreatment with 4MP+C prevented peripheral acetaldehyde accumulation. A characteristic common to both cyanamide-treated groups was the inhibition of brain ALDH. It is therefore suggested that brain ALDH may play a role in the mediation of ethanol-induced CTAs. It is conceivable that ALDH plays this role by regulating the levels of acetaldehyde in brain.\r"

The effect of ethanol intoxication on fine motor control was measured by a typing test. When sober, the two groups performed in comparable fashion. When intoxicated, the CPAF group displayed significantly greater impairment than the nonflushing group as measured by typing errors committed in 3 min (CPAF: 55.4 +/- 10.1 errors, n = 12; vs. nonflushing: 15.6 +/- 2.3, n = 32; p = 0.0000015 by Student's unpaired t test). Chlorpropamide alcohol flushers appeared to be more sensitive to ethanol. Naloxone reversed this effect for individuals in the CPAF group (saline treatment: 51.0 +/- 11.7 errors per minute; vs. naloxone treatment: 23.7 +/- 4.2; p = 0.034 by Student's paired t test, n = 6). Naloxone had no effect in the nonflushing group. Unlike the normal, nonflushing group, the CPAF group demonstrated an increased sensitivity to ethanol that was partially antagonized by naloxone.\r"

The remaining peaks, which were not recognized by any of the available mass spectral libraries, were identified by high resolution electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectrometry and low resolution tandem mass spectrometry using fast atom bombardment ionization; they were triethylene glycol esters and aryl phosphates.

The Km values at pH 7.4 and 500 microM NAD for imidazoleacetaldehyde and gamma-aminobutyraldehyde for the E1 isozyme are 40 and 800 microM, respectively, and for the E2 isozyme are 50 and 500 microM, respectively. The Km values with gamma-aminobutyraldehyde with both isozymes are high relative to Km values with acetaldehyde (50 microM for E1 and 1 microM for E2). Since activity with both imidazoleacetaldehyde and gamma-aminobutyraldehyde in crude liver homogenates paralleled that of aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) during purification it appears likely that in the human liver this enzyme is responsible for metabolism of both compounds. If this is the case, interaction between metabolism of histamine and putrescine and that of alcohol is likely. Both imidazoleacetaldehyde and gamma-aminobutyraldehyde were synthesized in this laboratory and their stability has been investigated. Procedures for assaying aldehyde dehydrogenase employing synthetic metabolites of histamine and putrescine are provided.\r"

A fourth group served as ad libitum nontreated controls to assess the role of pair feeding. Males were then mated with nontreated females. The males consuming alcohol had an increased percentage of abnormal sperm and there was a significant effect of paternal alcohol exposure on implantation sites, but no effect on pre- or postnatal mortality or fetal weight. These results suggest that paternal alcohol consumption adversely affects sperm production but does not affect development of offspring in mice.\r"

(Alcohol Clin Exp Res 10:343-349, 1986) have argued recently that the use of postdrug minus predrug difference scores to assess individual variability in sensitivity or tolerance to ethanol is not to be recommended. Unreliability of variables can result in biased estimates of response to treatment. Instead of difference scores, they recommend using residual scores from the regression of posttreatment on pretreatment measures. We were interested in the consequences of employing difference scores versus regression residuals for a related, but different purpose: the choice of individual animals to be mated for a selective breeding study. The availability of data from such a selective breeding experiment ongoing in the laboratory of one of us (JCC) allowed us to compare directly the effects of use of change and residual scores as criteria for selection. The selection is for maximal hypothermic sensitivity of mice to an acute dose of ethanol. In our sample, difference scores were highly correlated with regression residuals. In practical terms, almost 75% of the individuals chosen for mating by the change score method would also have been chosen by the residual score method. We conclude that for selective breeding experiments, the use of difference scores does not necessarily introduce sampling bias, is unlikely to affect the ultimate outcome of selection, and may be a more meaningful variable for the physiological process studied.\r"

A 3-day exposure of exponentially growing 32IIIA cells to growth medium containing 100 mM ethyl alcohol decreased final population density (to less than 70% of control values) although viability was unaffected, approximating 94% under all experimental conditions. Comparative flow cytometric analysis of control and ethanol-treated populations revealed significant ethanol-associated alterations in the substate composition of G1 phase hepatic tumor cells. An ethanol-induced 30% increase in mean population doubling time was reflected in an approximately 22% increase in the proportion of G1 phase cells within a culture. Lower overall G1 cellular RNA content typified all ethanol-treated 32IIIA tumor cell populations. The fraction of G1 cells in the immediate pre-DNA-synthetic (G1B) compartment was markedly reduced (by 41-80%) during the period of ethanol exposure as were the percentages of S and G2+M phase cells which derive kinetically from cells in G1B. This reduction in the proportion of cells with normal G1B RNA levels was not reflected solely in the complement of very low RNA content \"G1E-type\" cells generated during the course of ethanol treatment. Net accumulations (of 19 and 34%) of cells residing in the G1A substate were consistent additional concomitants of ethanol treatment. Short-term ethanol exposure in the 32IIIA hepatic tumor cell system clearly impairs normal progression of such cells through the G1 phase of the cell division cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied five male carriers of hepatitis B e antigen who were social drinkers. Levels of HBV-DNA, blood alcohol, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured during abstinence from alcohol, before and during a test dose (29.8 g) of alcohol which followed one week of abstinence, and before and during the same test dose which followed social drinking for one week. We observed no significant changes in HBV-DNA or AST levels. These data suggest that a single one-week period of social drinking in patients with chronic HBV infection does not cause enhanced viral replication. The risks of repeated ingestion of moderate amounts of alcohol by such patients have not been established. Interpretation of our data is limited by the small number of subjects, and further studies are needed. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with published recommendations that social drinking by nonalcoholic HBV carriers should be restricted but need not be totally forbidden.\r"

The activities were 1.7 +/- 0.1, 2.3 +/- 0.1, and 2.6 +/- 0.2 mumol/min/g liver in rats aged 4-5, 14-15, and 24-25 months, respectively. Hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity in female rats (3.4 +/- 0.2 mumol/min/g liver) was the same in young as in old rats. Castration increased alcohol dehydrogenase activity in young males to levels found in females, and testosterone administration reversed the effect. However, neither physiological nor pharmacological doses of the hormone restored the elevated enzyme activities of old male rats to levels found in young male rats.\r"

  ".W": "Pregnant rats were fed an ethanol diet from the first day of pregnancy until parturition. Control rats were either pair fed with an isocaloric sucrose diet, or fed with standard lab chow (basic control group). Rats fed with the ethanol diet and their pair-fed controls showed a similar increase in body weight during pregnancy, which was lower than the increase observed in the basic control group. At 10 days after ethanol withdrawal all three groups presented similar body weights. A lower body growth was exhibited by the offspring of both the ethanol and the sucrose pair-fed rats, implicating a prenatal nutritional factor on the postnatal growth. Furthermore, the rate of body growth was lower in the offspring of the ethanol-treated animals than in the offspring of both their pair-fed and the basic control rats, indicating the presence of an additional ethanol-associated factor. On day 4 of development, the concentration of beta-endorphin peptides (pmol/mg protein) in the pituitary gland and the anterior lobe, of the offspring of the ethanol-treated animals and their sucrose pair-fed controls, was significantly higher than that of the offspring of the basic control animals. However, a lower content of beta-endorphin-like peptides was noticed in the whole pituitary gland, the anterior lobe, and the intermediate lobe of the offspring of the ethanol-treated rats and their pair-fed controls on days 8, 14, and 22 postnatally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Long sleep (LS) and short sleep (SS) lines of mice were derived from a heterogeneous stock of mice (HS) and have been selectively bred on the basis of the time the animals were devoid of the righting reflex (sleep time) following acute ethanol administration. We have tested a large group of the HS mice for sleep time response to ethanol. Animals were then selected from the extremes of the HS sleep time response and designated short sleep (HS-SS) or long sleep (HS-LS). The ED50 value for loss of righting reflex was compared between these mice (HS-SS and HS-LS) and animals that had undergone 25 generations of selection (SS and LS mice). The ED50 value was not significantly different for the HS-LS (1.9 g/kg) and LS (2.17 g/kg) mice but was markedly different between HS-SS (3.02 g/kg) and SS (4.21 g/kg) mice. The ED50 values for the eight inbred strains that constituted the HS stock ranged only from 2.33 to 2.78 g/kg. The value for LD50 one hour after ethanol administration was found to be 9.03 g/kg and for SS mice 6.94 g/kg for LS mice, in contrast to our previous findings of no difference in LD50 values between SS and LS mice when ascertained 24 hr after the ethanol dose. Since the two lines were selected only for a sleep time difference, a differential sensitivity to other consequences of acute ethanol exposure, such as the lethal dose, would not be expected unless the effects shared a common genetic mechanism of action with ethanol sleep time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This, in turn, is influenced by the fluctuating plasma concentrations of levodopa produced by the drug's short half-life and erratic absorption, and by modifiable transport at the blood-brain barrier. Duration of response to a single dose of levodopa is proportional to peak plasma drug levels, and paradoxical responses may occur when plasma concentrations are in the vicinity of minimum effective concentrations. Thus the strategy of administering frequent, small doses of levodopa may contribute additional unpredictability to a fluctuating clinical response imposed by pharmacokinetic factors.\r"

Twenty-four-hour urine excretion values for AAP and beta 2M were determined on treatment day 1 and day 5 for patients receiving the three treatment regimens and for the control group. AAP excretion values for the vancomycin-treated group were not found to be statistically different from those of the control group. Both the gentamicin and the vancomycin-gentamicin groups had statistically higher AAP excretion values on treatment day 1 as well as on treatment day 5 when compared with the vancomycin and control groups. AAP excretion on day 5 of treatment was highest for the vancomycin-gentamicin group. Overall, beta 2M elimination was variable in all treatment groups. Although the beta 2M values were elevated as early as day 1 in all treatment groups, they were significantly elevated only in the vancomycin-gentamicin group on day 1 and only in the gentamicin group on day 5 compared with the vancomycin and the control groups. AAP appears to be a sensitive indicator of renal tubular damage. The combination of vancomycin and gentamicin results in greater AAP excretion than does either agent alone.\r"

Herpes simplex virus-infected cell cultures in microtiter plates were treated with concentrations of acyclovir ranging from 8 to 0.015 micrograms/ml. At 48 h postinfection, infected cells were lysed by a one-step procedure and lysates were absorbed to membranes. Without further treatment, membranes were hybridized by using a herpes simplex virus-specific radioiodinated probe. The membranes were then washed and counted in a gamma counter. The elapsed time for assay performance was 4 h. Parallel plaque reduction assays were performed for comparison. The mean 50% inhibitory dose of in vivo- and in vitro-derived acyclovir-resistant, thymidine kinase-negative isolates was greater than 2 micrograms/ml by DNA hybridization. The 50% inhibitory dose of acyclovir-susceptible, thymidine kinase-positive isolates ranged from 0.01 to 1.1 micrograms/ml. This assay is simple and objective and should facilitate antiviral susceptibility testing in diagnostic laboratories.\r"

Substantial underlying disease was present in most of the patients; pathogens isolated prior to treatment (77 isolates) consisted mainly of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and streptococci. Of the etiologic bacteria, 67% were eradicated by ciprofloxacin treatment and 79% by imipenem therapy; however, two patients (6.7%) failed in the ciprofloxacin group, and six patients (20%) did not respond to imipenem treatment (P = 0.25). All patients with therapeutic failures suffered from severe fatal underlying diseases, which had substantial impact on the outcome of treatment. Therapeutic drug monitoring in the ciprofloxacin patients revealed higher concentrations in serum at days 4 and 8 in comparison with day 1 of treatment, indicating that steady-state conditions were reached between days 1 and 4. The total number of side effects was relatively high--eight imipenem patients (25%) and six ciprofloxacin patients (18%) had reactions. Treatment had to be discontinued due to adverse reactions for three ciprofloxacin patients and two imipenem patients. Major side effects in both groups were gastrointestinal and central nervous system-related symptoms. In terms of clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety, there was no statistical difference between the two groups, and both groups gave good to excellent results for bacterial infections that were difficult to treat.\r"

The chromatographic behavior and chemical properties of this sea algal extract (SAE) suggest that it is a sulfated polysaccharide having a molecular weight of approximately 2,000,000. SAE is composed of galactose (73%), sulfonate (20%), and 3,6-anhydrogalactose (0.65%). SAE is a member of the lambda-carrageenan family, based on its infrared spectrum and products of hydrolysis. SAE selectively inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RT and replication in vitro. When MT-4 cells were treated with more than 10(4) inhibitory units (IU) of SAE per ml after HIV infection, significant inhibition of viral antigen synthesis was observed. Furthermore, more than 90% of cells were viable in the cultures exposed to 4 X 10(4) to 8 X 10(4) IU of SAE per ml, while almost all the MT-4 cells in the control culture had died by 10 days after HIV infection. The inhibitory effect of SAE on HIV replication was confirmed by plaque reduction assays. The 50% inhibitory dose of SAE was 9.5 x 10(3) IU/ml. Chondroitin sulfate A, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, keratan polysulfate, and heparin also inhibited the RT of avian myeloblastosis virus. SAE immediately inhibited RT activity when added to an assay mixture after the start of the reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of streptomycin-resistant (rpsL) mutants of Salmonella typhimurium in alkaline nutrient medium containing streptomycin brought about an inhibition of cell growth that was readily reversed by removing the antibiotic or neutralizing the medium. Growth inhibition was maximal at pH 8.2 and a streptomycin concentration of 800 micrograms/ml. A similar amount of dihydrostreptomycin had a negligible effect, and 10-times-higher concentrations of this antibiotic were required to reproduce the streptomycin action. Addition of streptomycin (400 micrograms/ml) to rpsL cells in alkaline (pH 8.2) nutrient medium caused inhibition of protein and DNA synthesis and also, but to a lower degree, of RNA synthesis. This effect on macromolecular synthesis was not due to ATP deprivation, since ATP content rose after addition of the antibiotic. At pH 8.2, the rate of entrance of streptomycin increased fourfold with respect to the rate at pH 7.0, leading to a large accumulation of streptomycin into rpsL cells. Uptake of the antibiotic was halted by addition of KCN or chloramphenicol. Equal uptake was obtained with 800 micrograms of dihydrostreptomycin or 400 micrograms of streptomycin per ml, yet the former did not affect cell growth at that concentration. It is concluded that high pH stimulates streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin uptake by rpsL strains but only streptomycin accumulation causes growth inhibition in cells lacking the high-affinity ribosomal site.\r"

Ceftriaxone was given at different dosages, alone or with an interfering agent, diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, to determine the predictive value of the antibiotic levels in serum or infected vegetations on the antibacterial efficacy. Diclofenac increased the serum terminal half-life of ceftriaxone and increased its extravascular diffusion in tissue cage fluid, as well as in infected vegetations, allowing us to obtain various antibiotic concentrations in the infected site. Two hours after the fourth injection, around the time of peak level in serum, we observed a linear relationship between (i) serum and local antibiotic levels in vegetations, (ii) local antibiotic levels in a range of 142 to 600 X MBC and bacterial titer (log10 CFU/g) in vegetations, and (iii) serum antibiotic levels in a range of 800 to 1,400X MBC and bacterial titer in vegetations. In vivo, antibacterial effect was obtained only with high antibiotic levels in vegetations (greater than or equal to 220X MBC). This was confirmed by incubating vegetations sampled from infected animals in rabbit serum containing ceftriaxone (ex vivo experiment). Given once daily at a therapeutic dosage (30 mg/kg) for 4 days, ceftriaxone exhibited good efficacy (log10 CFU/g of vegetation = 2.41 +/- 2.7 versus 7.41 +/- 0.92 in control animals) and prevented regrowth of bacteria until 24 h after the last injection. We concluded that (i) provided the dose is sufficient, a long-acting cephalosporin can prove effective in severe gram-negative infections even when given infrequently, and (ii) serum antibiotic levels around the peak value, reflecting high effective local levels, could predict the therapeutic efficacy and represent a simple test to monitor the clinical course of a severe infectious process.\r"

  ".W": "Escherichia coli bearing a cryptic tetracycline resistance determinant from Bacteroides fragilis expressed low-level constitutive resistance to tetracycline under aerobic, but not anaerobic, growth conditions and accumulated less tetracycline aerobically than did isogenic susceptible cells. This decreased uptake was energy dependent and reversible by increased concentrations of tetracycline, suggesting a saturable carrier-mediated active efflux mechanism. Decreased uptake was not seen when the cells were grown and assayed anaerobically. Other tetracycline resistance determinants (classes A to E) isolated from gram-negative enteric bacteria expressed resistance and generated active efflux of tetracycline under anaerobic as well as aerobic conditions. When the Bacteroides determinant was placed in the same cell with any of the class A to E tetracycline resistance determinants, there was an increase in resistance under aerobic conditions of as much as 48% more than was projected by adding the resistances expressed by the determinants individually. In cells bearing the class A determinant together with the Bacteroides determinant, saturation of the active efflux system required over twofold more exogenous tetracycline than did cells bearing the class A determinant alone. We have designated this new tetracycline resistance determinant class F.\r"

In vivo, the dose of O-AME required to produce a 10,000-fold reduction of Candida albicans in a mouse kidney infection was similar to that of AMB and 1/10 that of AME. After intravenous treatment of infected mice and rats and subcutaneous treatment of mice, average 50% protective doses for O-AME and AMB were similar. Acute intravenous 50% lethal doses in mice indicated that O-AME was one-ninth as toxic as AMB but twice as toxic as AME. Acute renal function tests in rats indicated that Sch 28191 was less than 1/10 as toxic as AMB and slightly more toxic than AME.

To assess the relationship among these enzymes, we produced and characterized 28 murine monoclonal antibodies to the TEM-1 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase. Radial immunodiffusion identified 3 monoclonal antibodies as immunoglobulin M (IgM), 18 as subclass IgG1, 2 as IgG2a, and 5 as IgG2b. Using a newly described enzyme immunoassay, cross-reactivity of 16 of these monoclonal antibodies was tested against 24 plasmid-determined beta-lactamases. The 16 monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with TEM-2 and TLE-1 and, to a certain extent, SHV-1. Different levels of cross-reactivity were also observed with OXA-3 (11 of 16), OXA-7 (8 of 16), OXA-1 (2 of 16), OXA-6 (2 of 16), and AER-1 (2 of 16). Six monoclonal antibodies demonstrated partial neutralization of beta-lactamase activity. This study suggests that common epitopes are shared by nine biochemically distinct plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. On the basis of cross-reactivities with these monoclonal antibodies, we identified four epitopes on TEM-1, TEM-2, TLE-1, and SHV-1 beta-lactamases.\r"

  ".W": "The antibacterial activities of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime against Klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro and in vivo were compared. Although there was only a minor difference between the MBCs of both drugs, the bacterial killing rate of ciprofloxacin in vitro was very fast in comparison with that of ceftazidime. Similarly, the intravenous administration of ciprofloxacin at 1 h after bacterial inoculation resulted in effective bacterial killing in the lungs of leukopenic rats. This killing was dose dependent, in contrast to the dose-independent bactericidal effect of ceftazidime. The high antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin in the lungs as compared with that of ceftazidime was also reflected in its therapeutic efficacy in K. pneumoniae pneumonia and septicemia in leukopenic rats when these infections were treated at 6-h intervals over 4 days, starting at 5 h after bacterial inoculation. Concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime in lung tissue were not significantly different. Regarding the antibacterial activity of both drugs against K. pneumoniae in relation to the bacterial growth rate in vitro and in the lungs of leukopenic rats, ciprofloxacin killed K. pneumoniae organisms that were not actively growing, whereas ceftazidime did not. In addition, it was demonstrated that when the intravenous administration of antibiotic was delayed from 1 h up to 24 h after bacterial inoculation, ceftazidime lost its antibacterial activity in the lungs and blood of leukopenic rats, whereas ciprofloxacin was still very effective. These data suggest that the capacity of an antibiotic to kill bacteria at a slow growth rate may be relevant for its therapeutic effect in established infections, in which slowly growing bacteria form a substantial part of the total bacterial population.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of action of the quinolone analogs ofloxacin and S-25930, which are unusual because of the presence of a third ring with an asymmetric carbon, was studied. Drug-resistant strains of Escherichia coli were selected by serial passage in the presence of ofloxacin, and a mutation was mapped near the gyrA gene of DNA gyrase. DNA gyrase containing the A subunit purified from this strain as compared with the isogenic wild-type strain exhibited increased resistance to ofloxacin, proving that the mutation was located in the gyrA gene. For S-25930, the S stereoisomer was more potent than the R isomer in inhibiting wild-type E. coli and DNA gyrase containing an A subunit isolated from this strain. Both isomers had decreased potency against the isogenic ofloxacin-resistant (gyrA) strain and its purified enzyme, but the S isomer remained more potent than the R isomer. These studies, using a combined genetic and biochemical approach, demonstrate (i) that DNA gyrase is a target of the tricyclics ofloxacin and S-25930, (ii) that serial exposure to ofloxacin can select resistance to tricyclic quinolone agents by mutation in the gyrA gene, and (iii) that the more potent antibacterial activity of S relative to R S-25930 correlates with increased activity against DNA gyrase for both wild-type and ofloxacin-resistant (gyrA) isogenic strains.\r"

An isolation procedure guided by bioassays and immunologic methods disclosed 2 anionic bioactive polypeptides with Mr of 28,000 and 16,000, respectively, as judged by single bands with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in reduced and nonreduced samples. Rabbit antibodies raised against each purified protein were shown to react, on immunodiffusion and Western blot, with both antigens. Immunohistochemical and immunobinding studies detected the protein in normal human synovial, dermal, and cartilage fibroblasts and in human saphenous vein endothelial cells. The mesenchymal cell-derived growth factor is now designated connective tissue activating peptide-V (CTAP-V). Monospecific polyclonal anti-CTAP-V antibodies were used in a radial immunodiffusion assay for quantitative determination of the antigen in biologic fluids. In normal human plasma the concentration of CTAP-V was below the limit of detection. The CTAP-V concentration in normal urine was 4.5 +/- 2.0 micrograms/ml, calculated from measurements of 5-18-fold concentrated samples. Joint fluid from patients with rheumatic diseases and normal renal function had CTAP-V levels similar to those found in plasma; 2-15-fold increases were detected in plasma and joint fluid of patients with chronic renal failure. Immunodiffusion or dot-blot analysis revealed a CTAP-V-like material in the plasma or serum of 10 mammalian species. It was not detectable in 2 avian species.\r"

Heating blood donor serum specimens at 56 degrees C for at least 10 min inactivates virus, but converted 7.1% of nonreactive specimens to positive when measured by this IEMA. Also heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min increased A values of most specimens; however, the conversion to positive within assay ranged from 0 to 75%, with a mean of 17%. When 56 nonreactive patient specimens were heated, 55% became Abbott IEMA reactive, although ENI IEMA values did not increase and Western blot results remained nonreactive. Binding of immunoglobulins G and A to Abbott IEMA beads did not cause this conversion after heat treatment. We postulate that heating specimens causes alteration of some serum matrices and introduces nonspecific binding to assay bead antigen or antibody reagents. We recommend that for the Abbott IEMA, specimens may be stored frozen, and must not be heated to avoid altered reactivity.\r"

Twenty-six patients had lymphoproliferative lesions, the main feature being a densely cellular population of small lymphocytes. This group was further divided into reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and atypical lymphoid hyperplasia. Symptoms and signs were similar within the subgroups. The mean length of follow-up was 3.7 years. Of the 26 patients 14 had extraorbital lymphoproliferative disease, 9 had orbital recurrences and 2 died of widespread disease. Twelve patients had inflammatory lesions with distinctly different histologic features from those of the lymphoproliferative group. Symptoms and signs were similar to those in the latter group. The mean length of follow-up was 2.1 years. Four of the 12 had orbital recurrences; none had extraorbital disease or died of their disease. We feel that orbital lymphoproliferative lesions can easily be separated from clinically similar low-grade inflammatory lesions histologically and that they should be staged and followed like small lymphocytic lymphomas. Guidelines are given for handling these specimens in the laboratory.\r"

This article outlines an approach to the history, physical examination, diagnosis, and management of these infections. Adherence to such an approach should maximize the likelihood of attaining relief and obliteration of pain, prevention of acute and chronic sequelae, and ultimately, patient satisfaction.\r"

Early recognition of nasal cellulitis and mucormycosis with aggressive therapy is necessary to prevent serious complications. Multiple processes, including structural and drug-induced reactions, can mimic rhinitis. An orderly approach, including a good history and physical examination, coupled with use of the nasal smear, will allow the emergency physician to master this frequent complaint.\r"

Food boluses are most common in obstruction seen in adult patients and associated esophageal pathology is common in patients aged 60 years and older. Adults with nonfood foreign bodies have a high incidence of psychiatric, social, or chemical derangements. Pediatric patients most commonly ingest coins. Ingestions tend to occur during nonschool months or in high-risk situations, and repeat ingestions are not uncommon. Fatalities and other major complications are linked to type of foreign body, location, and duration of the impaction. Deaths have also occurred with endoscopic and enzymatic modalities of treatment. Glucagon and Foley catheter removal are safe techniques in selected patients, provided resuscitative skill and equipment are available. Based on these data, an algorithmic approach to the management of esophageal foreign bodies by the emergency physician is recommended (Table 5).\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen anesthetized mechanically ventilated patients recovering from multiple trauma were studied to compare the effects of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) and continuous positive-pressure ventilation (CPPV) on arterial baroreflex regulation of heart rate. Systolic arterial pressure and right atrial pressure were measured using indwelling catheters. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and mean airway pressure were continuously monitored. Lung volumes were measured using two linear differential transformers mounted on thoracic and abdominal belts. Baroreflex testing was performed by sequential intravenous bolus injections of phenylephrine (200 micrograms) and nitroglycerin (200 micrograms) to raise or lower systolic arterial pressure by 20-30 Torr. Baroreflex regulation of heart rate was expressed as the slope of the regression line between R-R interval of the ECG and systolic arterial pressure. In each mode of ventilation the ventilatory settings were chosen to control mean airway pressure and arterial PCO2 (PaCO2). In HFJV a tidal volume of 159 +/- 61 ml was administered at a frequency of 320 +/- 104 breaths/min, whereas in CPPV a tidal volume of 702 +/- 201 ml was administered at a frequency of 13 +/- 2 breaths/min. Control values of systolic arterial pressure, R-R interval, mean pulmonary volume above apneic functional residual capacity, end-expiratory pulmonary volume, right atrial pressure, mean airway pressure, PaCO2, pH, PaO2, and temperature before injection of phenylephrine or nitroglycerin were comparable in HFJV and CPPV. Baroreflex regulation of heart rate after nitroglycerin injection was significantly higher in HFJV (4.1 +/- 2.8 ms/Torr) than in CPPV (1.96 +/- 1.23 ms/Torr).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined airway closure with methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction in eight normal seated adults at a mean lung volume of 39% total lung capacity. Closure was evaluated in two ways. Regional closure was examined by comparing the regional distributions of 133Xe boluses distributed according to N2O uptake with those distributed by pulmonary perfusion; regions that exhibited less N2O uptake than perfusion were interpreted as having airway closure. In addition, we measured single-breath washouts of the same boluses; differences between the washouts indicated closure that was not necessarily regional. Basal airway closure increased with methacholine inhalation from 21 +/- 3 to 46 +/- 4% (means +/- SE; P less than 0.001). This was due to both decreased basal N2O uptake and a relative increase of basal perfusion. Washout curves of boluses distributed by perfusion did not change with bronchoconstriction. Before bronchoconstriction, washouts of boluses distributed by N2O uptake did not differ significantly from those distributed by perfusion. During bronchoconstriction, single-breath washouts of boluses distributed by N2O uptake showed increased concentration differences (P less than 0.015) that were significantly greater than those resulting from boluses delivered by perfusion. Changes in basal closure did not correlate with washout changes. We conclude that methacholine inhalation induced bronchoconstriction-increased basal airway closure and also increased airway closure in other lung regions in a way that did not relate to basal closure.\r"

A 3-h hyperglycemic clamp procedure (plasma glucose approximately 180 mg/dl) was used to study the insulin response to a fixed glycemic stimulus in 15 trained and 12 untrained subjects. During the 40-mU.m-2.min-1 insulin infusion, the glucose disposal rate was 10.2 +/- 0.5 mg.kg fat-free mass (FFM)-1.min-1 in the trained group compared with 8.0 +/- 0.6 mg.kg FFM-1.min-1 in the untrained group (P less than 0.01). In contrast, there was no significant difference in maximally stimulated glucose disposal: 17.7 +/- 0.6 in the trained vs. 16.7 +/- 0.7 mg.kg FFM-1.min-1 in the untrained group. During the hyperglycemic clamp procedure, the incremental area for plasma insulin was lower in the trained subjects for both early (0-10 min: 140 +/- 18 vs. 223 +/- 23 microU.ml-1.min; P less than 0.005) and late (10-180 min: 4,582 +/- 689 vs. 8,895 +/- 1,316 microU.ml-1.min; P less than 0.005) insulin secretory phases. These data demonstrate that 1) the improved insulin action in healthy trained subjects is due to increased sensitivity to insulin, with no change in responsiveness to insulin, and 2) trained subjects have a smaller plasma insulin response to an identical glucose stimulus than untrained individuals.\r"

Twenty nonathletic and 11 athletic boys (age 9-12 yr), 15 female adult runners, and 11 male nonathletic students participated in this study. The muscle composition of the leg and thigh were measured by ultrasound. The lactate threshold was assessed in terms of both the absolute work rate (ml.kg-1.min-1) and relative work rate. The relative cross-sectional area of the gastrocnemius to the plantar flexor (relative gastrocnemius area) was significantly negatively related to the absolute and relative lactate threshold in all groups. These results suggest that the relative gastrocnemius area may play an important role in determining the relative and absolute lactate threshold during running.\r"

During these trials, plasma glucose declined from 5.0 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.1 mM (P less than 0.001) and respiratory exchange ratio (R) fell from 0.87 +/- 0.01 to 0.81 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001). After resting 20 min the subjects attempted to continue exercise either 1) after ingesting a placebo, 2) after ingesting glucose polymers (3 g/kg), or 3) when glucose was infused intravenously (\"euglycemic clamp\"). Placebo ingestion did not restore euglycemia or R. Plasma glucose increased (P less than 0.001) initially to approximately 5 mM and R rose (P less than 0.001) to approximately 0.83 with glucose infusion or carbohydrate ingestion. Plasma glucose and R then fell gradually to 3.9 +/- 0.3 mM and 0.81 +/- 0.01, respectively, after carbohydrate ingestion but were maintained at 5.1 +/- 0.1 mM and 0.83 +/- 0.01, respectively, by glucose infusion.

Plasma insulin (approximately 10 microU/ml) and vastus lateralis muscle glycogen (approximately 40 mmol glucosyl U/kg) did not change during glucose infusion, with three-fourths of total carbohydrate oxidation during the second exercise bout accounted for by the euglycemic glucose infusion rate (1.13 +/- 0.08 g/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
