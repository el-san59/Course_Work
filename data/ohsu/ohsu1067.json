Blood routinely covers gowns during surgery and often contaminates surgeons' undergarments and skin. Because of risks to the surgical team by blood-borne pathogens, disposable and reusable gowns were examined. To quantify \"strike through,\" 1440 samples of gown fabric were tested against human blood in an apparatus designed to simulate abdominal pressure during surgery. Representative pressures (0.25 to 2.0 psi) and times (1 second to 5 minutes) were studied. Above 0.5 psi, spun-bond/melt-blown/spun-bond disposable products were more resistant than spun-lace cloth. New cloth gowns were better than those washed 40 times. Spun-bond/melt-blown/spun-bond fabric exposed to blood twice was more protective than spun-lace cloth challenged once. Gowns currently available exhibit varying resistance to strike through; only those with an impervious plastic reinforcement offer complete protection.\r"

Evaluation of 115 patients with primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax treated with tube thoracostomy revealed nearly maximal healing rates after 48 hours without a relevant increase if drainage was maintained for up to 10 days. In secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, a significantly lower healing rate was observed after 48 hours compared with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (60% vs 82%). Therapeutic success was not predictable by single clinical variables available at admission (eg, age, gender, and smoking habits) nor by their combinations. Recurrence rates were 30% in both primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Hospital stay averaged 6 days in primary and 15 days in secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Considering their efficacy and the low incidence of complications, the early use of invasive procedures such as surgical pleurectomy, after 48 hours of persistent gas leaking, seems justified. Shorter in-patient care and lower recurrence rates may result.\r"

We studied the progression of hepatocellular injury after ischemia and ischemia with reperfusion in rats. Irreversible injury was quantitated using a triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay that was shown to correlate with ultrastructural changes. Adenosine triphosphate decreased to 36% of basal values after 30 minutes, but returned to normal with reperfusion with no decrease in viability. In contrast, viability fell by 30% after 60 minutes of ischemia, and by 64% when 60 minutes of ischemia was followed by reperfusion. We conclude that reperfusion of ischemic liver increases the degree of irreversible damage. The model employed here seems to be useful for studying ischemic and reperfusion injury in the liver.\r"

After an intraperitoneal injection of labeled bacteria, blood radioactivity was only initially lower in E coli plus bile peritonitis compared with E coli peritonitis. Clearance from blood was lower in E coli plus bile peritonitis than in E coli peritonitis. Organ localization was similar in E coli peritonitis and E coli plus bile peritonitis with decreased splenic, increased pulmonary, and unchanged hepatic uptakes compared with controls. Impaired peritoneal absorption of bacteria, together with impaired local host defense, is likely to enhance the noxious effect of bile in E coli peritonitis.\r"

Exposure was excellent and allowed repositioning of leads for optimal defibrillation thresholds in 18 patients. Five of 19 patients who had previously undergone intrapericardial procedures required intrapericardial dissection for lead placement to provide satisfactory defibrillation thresholds. There were no intraoperative deaths or infarctions. The 30-day mortality rate of 3.9% was comparable with those in other series, and the use of muscle-sparing techniques and supplemental epidural anesthesia prevented pulmonary complications or the need for prolonged ventilatory support. We favor a muscle-sparing lateral thoracotomy incision for automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator insertion, particularly in patients with a history of previous intrapericardial procedures.\r"

However, early and late complications related to catheter-tip injury and balloon trauma continue to occur and compromise the results of surgical intervention. Myointimal hyperplasia is an example of an unusual late complication induced by balloon-related arterial wall trauma. Myointimal hyperplasia is a commonly recognized healing response of the arterial wall to endothelial injury but is rarely reported after balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy. The extensive nature of the injury increases the incidence of limb loss. The pathophysiologic nature of this process is reviewed, and pertinent structural details such as intimal thickening and disruption of the internal elastic lamina are presented. The pathogenesis of myointimal hyperplasia suggests guidelines for catheter use during embolectomy that may further reduce the incidence of this unusual complication.\r"

The strength and function in both prednisone-treated groups improved equally and were significantly better than in the placebo group. To compare alternate-day and daily dosing of prednisone with respect to benefits and adverse side effects, the placebo group was started on alternate-day prednisone therapy, and the treatment group regimens were changed to equivalent doses of alternate-day prednisone without breaking the double-blind nature. At the end of 6 months, the group that was changed from daily to alternate-day therapy had declined in strength back to levels observed 12 months previously, at the start of daily therapy. The group in which alternate-day therapy was started showed a significant improvement in strength at 3 months, similar in magnitude to the response of boys treated with daily therapy. However, their strength declined significantly in the subsequent 3 months compared with boys who received daily therapy. The frequency of side effects was not significantly different for alternate-day therapy compared with daily therapy. We conclude that alternate-day prednisone therapy effectively increases strength but does not sustain the improvement to the same extent as daily therapy or mitigate side effects.\r"

The age-adjusted incidences of 1.27 per 100,000 person-years in males and 1.03 per 100,000 person-years in females were lower than recent rates in the northern US, Canadian, and northern European studies but higher than rates in southern European studies. Comparisons with other recent incidence studies show less uniformity in occurrence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in both the overall rates and in the age- and sex-specific patterns, than was suggested by mortality studies. The incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis among blacks and whites was similar. Hispanic males had incidences similar to white males, although a deficit of female Hispanic cases was found in Harris County. The prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis peaked in the 65- to 74-year age group at 33 per 100,000 population among males and 19 per 100,000 population for females.\r"

The estimated prevalence of dementia for white women (2.9%) was similar to that for white men (3.3%), but the rate for black women was distinctly higher than for black men (19.9% and 8.9%, respectively). Blacks were more likely than whites to have a history of stroke, hypertension, and other chronic disorders that might have contributed to the development of dementia.

This study evaluated maternal and paternal age at birth of 237 patients with Alzheimer's disease, each of whom was matched to five control subjects based on sex, year of birth, survival age, and location of residence. It was found that decreased paternal age substantially increased the susceptibility to the common form of Alzheimer's disease that occurs after the age of 67 years, whereas advanced maternal age had a negligible effect on risk of Alzheimer's disease. The higher incidence of late-onset Alzheimer's disease among persons born to younger fathers is consistent with a genetic imprinting mechanism involving DNA methylation. The proposed model postulates a role for environmental agents in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and accounts for families that show an aggregation of cases but no apparent pattern of inheritance.\r"

The concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, the metabolites of these biogenic amines, and the specific activity of choline acetyltransferase were also determined in these four cortical regions as well as in the substantia nigra, thalamus, amygdala, and caudate nucleus. Psychosis was associated with significantly increased densities of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the prosubiculum and middle frontal cortex, respectively, with trends toward increased densities of these lesions in the other areas examined. This finding is consistent with the increased rate of cognitive decline that accompanies this behavioral disorder. Psychosis was also associated with the relative preservation of norepinephrine in the substantia nigra, with trends in this direction for five of the remaining seven brain regions examined, and a significant reduction of serotonin in the prosubiculum that was accompanied by trends toward reduced levels of serotonin and 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the remaining regions. The profile of neuropathologic and neurochemical changes associated with psychosis is distinct from that previously reported for major depression in the context of primary dementia.\r"

All patients were followed up for 12 months or until death. Frontal hypoperfusion (anteroposterior perfusion ratio, less than 0.90) was observed in 23 patients (77%). In eight patients who remained comatose and died, the total size of perfusion defects was larger (38% +/- 20%) than in the 21 patients who recovered consciousness (24% +/- 14%), but the anteroposterior ratio was similar in both of these patient groups (0.83 +/- 0.09) and significantly lower than in the controls (0.96 +/- 0.03). During follow-up, both the anteroposterior perfusion ratio and the relative defect size improved, but frontal hypoperfusion was still observed in seven of 13 patients. After cardiac arrest, regional cerebral blood flow is characterized by frontal hypoperfusion that tends to improve over time but that persists in most patients.\r"

The pathologic findings of the periventricular lesions consisted of gliosis with mild rarefaction and edema of the white matter. All patients had a sclerosing vasculopathy of unknown cause, which involved numerous small vessels within the periventricular lesions. The vessels stained negatively for amyloid, amyloid precursors, desmin, vimentin, keratin, immunoglobulin, and complement. On electron microscopy, small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries were characterized by swollen astrocytic foot processes surrounding the vessels; dense, perivascular collagen packing; crystalline arrays of filaments within basement membrane; giant lipid-laden lysosomes within perivascular cells; and narrowing of the vascular lumina. Similar changes were not seen in a control group of 19 patients. The pathologic features of the vessels in these cases are distinct from the vasculopathy associated with Binswanger's subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. We suggest that a spectrum of vasculopathies may be associated with dementia and periventricular hyperintense lesions on magnetic resonance imaging.\r"

First, a left superotemporal focus of activation, as measured by regional cerebral blood flow, was found to be positively correlated with task accuracy in a group of 69 normal adults. Next, that left superotemporal activation was replicated in a second group of 83 adults whose childhood reading ability was known from standardized tests given in childhood. Finally, in that latter group, childhood reading ability was also found to be inversely correlated with focal activation in a more posterior, temporoparietal area of cortex. Adult reading outcome was statistically unrelated to this finding. The results are interpreted as suggesting a trait anomaly of left hemisphere cerebral activation in adults who were dyslexic as children and as providing an existence proof of individual differences in focal cortical activation sites during constant task demands.\r"

  ".W": "The ability to generate antisaccades (eye movements deliberately made in the direction opposite to that of a visual stimulus) may be used to assess central nervous system function in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. However, the usefulness of this paradigm in clinical practice is limited by the need for an oculographic laboratory. We describe a clinical version of such an antisaccadic task and present normative data from 332 subjects. We also examined clinical antisaccades and cognitive performance in 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease, five patients with Huntington's disease, and 12 patients with pseudodementia. In Alzheimer's disease, error rates in the clinical antisaccadic test correlated well with those from a laboratory-based antisaccadic task measured on the same day by infrared oculography, confirming that the clinical antisaccadic test is a valid analog of the more sophisticated laboratory paradigms. Clinical antisaccadic error rates correlated strongly with the severity of dementia in Alzheimer's disease, and correlations with cognitive performance suggested that the clinical antisaccadic test may have some specificity for frontal lobe dysfunction. Patients with pseudodementia had normal clinical antisaccadic error rates, and the test may therefore be of use in differentiating dementia from pseudodementia. This clinical antisaccadic test provides a simple, reliable, and inexpensive quantitative clinical tool that is of value in the assessment of disturbances of higher cortical function.\r"

The medical symptoms of distorted body images match the literary description so precisely that illustrations from the original book depict them very accurately. Because Lewis Carroll suffered from classic migraine headaches, scholars have speculated that he may have experienced this syndrome himself.\r"

The embryologic origin remains a mystery; however, current theories implicate an aberration in primordial germ cell migration. Clinical presentation depends on tumor location and may involve endocrine, hypothalamic, visual, and cognitive dysfunction. In evaluating midline intracerebral masses, it is imperative that one be aware of the various radiologic appearances, endocrinologic changes, and chemical markers that help to distinguish germinomas from other neoplasms that appear in the pineal, suprasellar, and periventricular regions. Only through the careful evaluation of all available studies can the physician institute appropriate therapies such as biopsy, radiation, and chemotherapy. This article focuses on the epidemiology, embryology, clinical presentation, means of diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of this rare neoplasm.\r"

In previously reported cases of the syndrome, caused by stroke, however, the thalamus or brain stem has been the actual site of the lesion. We have studied two patients with infarct in the superficial middle cerebral artery territory involving the parietal operculum. Sensory involvement was purely subjective in the face, but severe hypoesthesia was present in the distal upper limb, involving mainly position sense, stereognosis, and graphesthesia. Temperature and pain sensation were involved in one patient. These findings correlated with involvement of the lower part of the postcentral gyrus, more caudal parts of the parietal operculum, and underlying white matter. This opercular cheiro-oral syndrome seems more uncommon than faciobrachiocrural hemihypesthesia associated with anterior parietal artery territory infarct. A double supply to the parietal opercular region through branches of the temporal arteries and anterior parietal artery may explain the rarity of cheiro-oral syndrome resulting from hemisphere stroke, because simultaneous and partial compromise to two different pial artery networks is uncommon.\r"

Crude agreement ranged from 77.8-100%. There was considerable discordance in assessing muscle tonus, equilibrium and protective reactions, spinal reflexes, tremor and dysmetria (crude agreement ranged from 49.7-97.9%).

Medical, legal and economic literature provide profiles of physicians involved in malpractice claims and the types of clinical situations in which suits are brought in general but no specifics on physiatry before 1973. Nine malpractice studies were examined to characterize malpractice claims in the field. The physiatrist's risk relative to other specialties could be studied specifically in three studies of 197,230 claims reported from 182 liability carriers. The number of claims brought was one-third of that predicted relative to the size of the specialty. The number of paid claims was one-fourth of that predicted, and the total dollar indemnity was one-fifth of that predicted. The average indemnity per claim rose 770% over a decade, from $12,000 in 1978 to $92,000 by 1988. Dollar losses were significantly lower than expected compared with other specialties classified by insurance carriers to be of similar risk such as neurology, pediatrics and general/family practice and one specialty considered to be very low, dermatology. Losses for physiatry were more similar to that of the very low risk category specialties such as psychiatry and pathology. One-fourth of successful claims resulting in one-third of the total dollar losses were associated with physical therapy. Cases involving femoral fracture comprised 14% of paid claims accounting for 34% of the total losses. Conditions of the vertebral column accounted for 35% of monetary losses and medication error accounted for 14% of monetary losses. The claim incidence was very low as one study of 71,130 claims identified none against physiatrists, with no more than 110 claims in any single study.\r"

They were used to survey 82 ventilator-assisted individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 273 physically intact health care professionals. A third instrument was devised to study the relative undesirability of dependence on mechanical ventilation. Ten of 80 responding patients (12.5%) expressed dissatisfaction with their lives in general. This compares with 9% of the surveyed health care professionals and 7% of the general population studied by Campbell. The health care professionals significantly underestimated the patients' scores in the life satisfaction and general affect instruments and significantly overestimated the patients' assessment of the relative hardship associated with ventilator dependence. We conclude that the vast majority of severely disabled chronic ventilator-assisted individuals with DMD have a positive affect and are satisfied with life despite the physical dependence which precludes many of the activities most commonly associated with perceived quality of life for physically intact individuals. Health care professionals should not use their judgment of the patient's quality of life to justify withholding life-sustaining therapy.\r"

Testing parameters included joint tenderness, joint swelling, time to walk 50 feet, handgrip strength and a written functional assessment. No significant exacerbation of joint symptoms using this weight-bearing form of exercise was observed. Tai-Chi Chuan exercise appears to be safe for RA patients and may serve as an alternative for their exercise therapy and part of their rehabilitation program. Weight-bearing exercises have the potential advantages of stimulating bone growth and strengthening connective tissue, but this effect needs to be documented in long-term studies.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the biomechanical adaptations used by the below-knee amputee while wearing a conventional prosthetic foot and to assess the influence of energy storing prosthetic feet on these adaptations. Mechanical power outputs of the lower extremity in five normal and five below-knee amputee subjects using the SACH, Seattle and Flex feet were studied. Ground reaction forces and kinematic data were collected at a walking speed of 1.5 m/s and were used to determine the muscular power outputs of the lower extremity during stance. Consistent patterns of muscular power output at the hip and knee of the residual limb occur. While wearing the SACH foot, negligible energy generation occurs at the prosthetic foot during pushoff. A decrease in energy absorption at the knee during the first half of stance and an increase in energy generation by the hip extensors were the major adaptations noted in the proximal muscle groups. Compared to the SACH foot, the energy storing feet demonstrated increased energy generation during pushoff. Despite the improvements in the performance of the energy storing prosthetic feet, no significant differences were found in the pattern or magnitude of knee and hip power outputs compared to the SACH foot.\r"

Of the complications associated with kidney failure, anemia and abnormal blood lipids profiles are among those that exercise may alter. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a self-monitored exercise program on the blood chemistry status in ESRD patients. The program consisted of aerobic activity maintained for a minimum of 15 min at least three times per week at an intensity of 10.8 +/- 2.13 on the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale (this scale correlates with heart rate and is used in cases where heart rate is not a reliable predictor of exercise intensity such as hemodialysis patients). Monthly blood samples were taken to assess the patients status regarding anemia and blood lipids. Results indicate no significant differences (P greater than 0.05) were seen from the beginning of the program until the end of the eighth month as seen below: [table; see text] Values are X +/- SEM. These data indicate that a self-monitored exercise program of moderate intensity may not be beneficial in helping regulate the anemia and altered blood lipid status of ESRD patients. Thus, since no physiological benefits are apparent with a self-monitored exercise program of low intensity, it is important to realize the potential risk involved with patients undertaking an unsupervised exercise program. These data illustrate that ESRD patients need supervised exercise programs in order to elicit a physiological training response.\r"

Twenty-five subjects (14 females, 11 males, mean +/- SD age 43 +/- 14 years) were studied; twenty-one subjects with focal myofascial pain and four with fibromyalgia. Spontaneous fibrillatory or positive sharp wave potentials were not found in any muscle in the 25 subjects. There was no evidence of focal motor unit activity in the tender points, trigger points or associated muscle bands in either group. Motor unit recruitment was similar in all areas sampled.

In the healthy controls the lower 95% tolerance limits for total 24 hour RR interval counts were approximately 2000 at age 25, 1000 at 45, and 500 at 65 years. Six controls confined to bed after injury had normal 24 hour patterns of RR counts, while eight other controls showed loss of diurnal variation in both heart rate and RR counts during a period of sleep deprivation. RR counts in ten controls on and off night duty increased during sleep whenever it occurred. Nearly half (146) the 343 diabetic patients had abnormal 24 hour RR counts. The percentage of abnormal RR counts increased with increasing autonomic abnormality assessed by a standard battery of tests of cardiovascular autonomic function. A quarter of those with normal cardiovascular reflex tests had abnormal 24 hour RR counts. There were close correlations between 24 hour RR count results and the individual heart rate tests (r = 0.6). The assessment of cardiac parasympathetic activity by 24 hour RR counts was reliable. The diurnal variations in RR counts seen in the controls were probably related to sleep rather than either posture or time of day. The method was more sensitive than conventional tests of cardiovascular reflexes.\r"

Malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly higher in the patients with congestive heart failure (median 9.0 nmol/ml interquartile range (IQR) 7.9-10.2) than in the controls (median 7.7 nmol/ml (IQR 6.9-9.2)). Plasma thiols were significantly lower in congestive heart failure (median 420 mumol/l (IQR 379-480)) than in the controls (median 463 mumol/l (IQR 445-525)). There was a significant but weak negative correlation between malondialdehyde and left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.35) and a positive correlation between plasma thiols and left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.39). This study provides clinical support for experimental data indicating that free radicals may be important in heart failure. It also suggests that the degree of free radical production may be linked to the severity of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Because they had irreversible damage to the left ventricular myocardium none of 12 patients with critical aortic stenosis diagnosed prenatally survived after postnatal treatment. This experience prompted three attempts at intrauterine balloon dilatation of the aortic valve in two fetuses with this condition. On each attempt the balloon catheter was successfully delivered to the left ventricle. In the first fetus the aortic valve was not crossed and the fetus died the next day. In the second fetus the balloon was correctly positioned across the aortic valve and inflated in the valve ring. After delivery, a further balloon angioplasty was performed; this relieved the stenosis but the patient died five weeks later from persisting left ventricular dysfunction related to endocardial fibroelastosis. Balloon angioplasty is feasible in fetal life but the prognosis depends on the ability of the relief of stenosis to limit, prevent, or allow regression of left ventricular damage before delivery.\r"

  ".W": "Troponin T is a unique cardiac antigen which is continuously released from infarcting myocardium. Its cardiospecificity as a marker protein might be particularly useful in assessing myocardial cell damage in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Therefore, circulating troponin T was measured in serial blood samples from 56 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and in two control groups--22 patients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery and 12 patients undergoing lung surgery by median sternotomy. In both control groups no troponin T could be detected, whereas activities of creatine kinase were raised in all 12 lung surgery controls and activities of the MB isoenzyme were raised in five of the 12 patients in the lung surgery group and in four of the 22 patients in the orthopaedic surgery group, respectively. All the patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 47) and cardiac surgery for other reasons (n = 9) had detectable concentrations of troponin T. Five patients had perioperative myocardial infarction detected as new Q waves and R wave reductions. In these five patients troponin T release persisted and serum concentrations (5.5-23 micrograms/l) reached a peak on the fourth postoperative day. In the 51 patients without perioperative myocardial infarction serum concentrations and the release kinetics of troponin T depended on the duration of cardiac arrest. In patients in whom aortic cross clamping was short troponin T increased slightly on the first postoperative days; in patients with longer periods of aortic cross clamping troponin T concentrations were higher and remained so beyond the fifth postoperative day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Doppler echocardiographic measurement of transmitral filling velocities seems to be a sensitive marker for resting left ventricular diastolic abnormalities in patients with coronary artery disease. The behaviour of these filling velocities during induced myocardial ischaemia, however, has not been fully studied. Left ventricular filling was assessed by pulsed Doppler ultrasound in 21 patients with angina pectoris and coronary artery disease and in five controls (patients with chest pain but without myocardial ischaemia). High dose dipyridamole infusion (0.9 mg/kg over 10 minutes) was used to provoke myocardial ischaemia, which was assessed by symptoms and electrocardiographic ST segment change. Doppler indices of diastolic filling were measured and the results expressed as percentage change from baseline values. Dipyridamole increased the heart rate and reduced systolic blood pressure equally in both groups. In the controls dipyridamole increased the peak filling velocities of both the early and atrial filling waves. In the 12 patients with coronary artery disease who did not develop evidence of myocardial ischaemia, the effect on left ventricular filling velocity resembled that in the controls though the time to peak change was delayed. Six of the nine patients with dipyridamole induced myocardial ischaemia had a significantly reduced maximum changes in early (+30% v +18%) and atrial (-0.2% v +33%) filling velocities compared with the controls. The remaining three patients had a decrease in early filling velocity (-20%) with an associated increase in atrial peak filling velocity (+21%). Dipyridamole increased diastolic filling velocities in the controls. In patients with coronary artery disease there was a variable change in diastolic filling indices which may be attributed either to the degree of myocardial ischaemia or to the different haemodynamic changes occurring during myocardial ischaemia.\r"

DESIGN--Data on 223 patients operated on at the Westminster Hospital, London, between 1946 and 1981, were collected and updated by questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS--All 223 patients recorded as undergoing operation for aortic coarctation up to the end of 1981. Fifteen of 197 survivors were lost to follow up; most of them were patients from overseas. OUTCOME AND RESULTS--The early mortality (within one month of operation) was 12% overall, 2.6% for elective surgery, and 0% for the 77 patients undergoing surgery since 1968. Survivors were followed up for a total of 3288 patient years; in 27 follow up lasted more than 30 years. In a few it reached 40 years. Twenty two patients died during this period, 18 from causes that could be attributed to coarctation or its repair. Mortality was highest more than 20 years after the operation. CONCLUSION--Repair increased life expectancy in patients with aortic coarctation. Late problems caused by persistent hypertension or recoarctation became apparent in long term survivors. The increased risk of late mortality associated with the duration of preoperative hypertension was not statistically significant. There were no deaths from cerebrovascular accidents. (In an earlier necropsy series cerebrovascular accidents accounted for 11.8% of deaths.) The incidence of deaths from aneurysms resembled that in the earlier necropsy series.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism that increases the orifice area of the mitral valve during balloon dilatation 43 surgically excised intact rheumatic mitral valves were studied. The main pathological features were (a) fibrosis of mitral valve leaflets and commissures (10 valves); (b) fibrosis with calcification of one commissure (eight anterolateral, seven posteromedial); (c) fibrosis with calcification of both commissures (seven valves); and (d) predominant involvement of the subvalvar apparatus (11 valves). The valves were assessed by photography and radiography before and after balloon dilatation (balloons up to 38 mm (bifoil 2 x 19 mm) and pressures up to 4 atmospheres). The valve was dilated in stages under direct visual control by balloons of increasing diameter. Splitting of the fused commissures was the most common mode of widening the orifice. However, the mitral valve leaflets were torn in two fibrotic valves and in six valves with extensive involvement of the subvalvar apparatus. In the fibrotic valves (group (a] the tear originated near the valve perimeter, at the thinnest part of the remaining valve leaflet. In the valves with subvalvar involvement splitting started at the apex of spaces between the fused chordal columns and proceeded upward. Where there is extensive involvement of the subvalvar apparatus in rheumatic mitral valve disease the risk of tearing of the valve leaflets by balloon dilatation is increased and this is likely to predispose to the development of acute valvar insufficiency.\r"

Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 4.8 (3.6) years (range two days to 14.7 years), and diagnosis occurred in infancy in eight. Associated cardiac abnormalities were present in 41 (71%) whereas fixed subaortic stenosis was an isolated lesion in 17 (29%). Four types of fixed subaortic stenosis were identified: short segment (47 (81%)), long segment (7 (12%)), posterior displacement of the infundibular septum with additional discrete narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract (3 (5%)), and redundant tissue arising from the membranous septum (1 (2%)). Echocardiographic studies had been performed before the diagnosis of fixed subaortic stenosis in nine patients, all with associated abnormalities. These were performed in infancy in each and showed a \"normal\" left ventricular outflow tract in six and posterior deviation of the infundibular septum in three. In 16 patients serial echocardiographic studies had been performed after the diagnosis of fixed subaortic stenosis but before surgery of the left ventricular outflow tract. Rapid evolution of short segment to long segment narrowing was seen in one patient, and tethering of the aortic valve or mitral valve developed in a further four patients. Aortic valve or mitral valve involvement was not seen before the age of three years but was common thereafter (10/40 patients, 25%). Fixed subaortic stenosis may be an \"acquired\" lesion with the potential for changes in form as well as progression in severity of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\r"

Ten patients, six under 1 year of age and four over, developed unilateral phrenic nerve injury. In those aged less than 1 year recovery after operation was prolonged because their diaphragmatic palsy made it difficult to wean them from the ventilator. Older children had symptoms but their rate of recovery did not seem to be affected by the phrenic nerve injury. Phrenic nerve damage was no more frequent after a lateral thoracotomy than after a median sternotomy. There was no significant association with the type of operation performed, the experience of the surgeon, the use of bypass or topical ice, the duration of bypass, circulatory arrest or aortic cross clamping, or the age of the patient at the time of operation. In patients who had cardiopulmonary bypass the risk of injury was significantly higher in those who had undergone previous operation. The 10% frequency of phrenic nerve injury determined in this prospective study was higher than that seen in earlier retrospective reports. Direct percutaneous stimulation of the phrenic nerve can be used at the bedside in infants and children to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of phrenic nerve palsy, and the results may influence early management.\r"

The rate of concurrent BP and malignancy (within 8 weeks) was 6.0% suggesting that there is probably a slight excess of malignancy in BP, but insufficient to warrant extensive investigation in pursuit of cancer. Comparison of the BP patients with and without cancer identified no clinical or immunopathological subgroups in whom investigations would be indicated. Three patients with both BP and malignancy were HLA-DR 13 positive, which may point to an immunogenetic predisposition to both diseases.\r"

In the first study two abrasive preparations (Brasivol fine and Brasivol medium) were compared with white soft paraffin and no treatment in eight volunteer subjects for their effects on the epidermis. The study was conducted over 3 days and measurements were taken of the effects on dansyl chloride-induced fluorescence to assess desquamation, epidermal thickness, and the tritiated thymidine autoradiographic labelling index. The abrasives were found to increase the desquamation rate significantly and to increase epidermal thickness and the epidermal labelling index compared to white soft paraffin and no treatment. In the second study the effect of one of the abrasive preparations (Brasivol medium) was compared with 0.05% tretinoin cream (Retin A) on the photodamaged skin of the dorsal aspects of the forearms of 12 subjects over an 8-week period. Cutaneous blood flow measured by the laser-Doppler flowmeter was found to be significantly increased in the abrasive-treated sites, but there was only a non-significant trend to increased blood flow in the tretinoin-treated sites. Measurements of skin thickness using pulsed A-scan ultrasound demonstrated that both treatments produced significant increases in thickness over the 8-week period but the increase was greater for the abrasive treated site. Measurements of the skin extensibility at the treated sites were made using a uniaxial extensometer. Forces needed for 30% skin extension were increased in the abrasive-treated sites only. Measurements of epidermal thickness and of [3H]-thymidine autoradiographic labelling indices showed greater increases in the abrasive-treated sites than in tretinoin-treated sites compared to untreated sites, but these increases were not statistically significant. No significant inflammation and no changes in the degree of elastosis or the presence of a 'repair zone' were found in any of the post-treatment biopsies. The results indicate that some of the changes produced in the skin by topical tretinoin that are taken to indicate a specific antiphotoageing effect may not in fact be specific and can be achieved by an abrasive preparation.\r"

Similarly, no sex differences were observed for TEWL and stratum corneum hydration. Capacitance was only significantly lower on the palms of the elderly. Regional differences showed a higher state of hydration on the forehead and postauricular as well as the upper arm, upper and lower back when compared with the volar forearm. TEWL was generally lower in the elderly on all anatomical regions except the postauricular and palm. A significant correlation was established between mu and capacitance for most regions. Between mu and TEWL significant correlation was observed only on the palm and thigh. These findings suggest that frictional properties of skin are dependent on more than water content or non-apparent sweating and the role of sebum secretion is suggested as one possible factor.\r"

Quantification of bacterial flora using both techniques showed high rates of colonization by S. aureus on both involved and clinically normal skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. A linear increase in S. aureus counts with increasing severity of dermatitis was found. In contrast, diphtheroids showed a trend of decreasing isolation rates and counts as the severity of the dermatitis increased. Isolation rates and absolute counts for micrococci/coagulase negative cocci were unaffected by the severity of the dermatitis.\r"

These molecules are expressed in various inflammatory dermatoses and in organ-culture explants. Triton X-100 extraction in the presence of calcium or EDTA suggested that calgranulins are detergent insoluble in the presence of calcium. The molecules were localized in a plaque-like structure at the cell periphery in lesional skin and in organ-culture explants. Following induction of calgranulins in vitro there was a redistribution of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton into a perinuclear halo, although desmosomes remained intact. These various features suggest that these members of the S-100 protein family have a role in cytoskeletal changes seen in various skin diseases.\r"

We have investigated the ultrastructural localization of basement membrane-related antigens in human foetal skin at different developmental ages using two monoclonal antibodies to a well-characterized basement membrane-associated heparan sulphate proteoglycan. A series of foetal skin specimens (range, 54-142 gestational days) were examined using an immunoperoxidase immunoelectron microscopic technique. In specimens representing very early developmental ages, very diffuse immunoreaction products were detected. However, by approximately 76 gestational days, some accentuation of heparan sulphate proteoglycan was noted along the lamina densa, and by 142 gestational days, the distribution of heparan sulphate proteoglycan was identical to that observed in neonatal and adult human skin. These findings demonstrate that active remodelling of the dermo-epidermal junction occurs during at least the first two trimesters, and affects not only basement membrane-associated structures but also specific antigens.\r"

We have administered one such GAG, heparin, to anagen-induced mice to help to elucidate this role, using the C57 Bl-6 model for murine hair growth studies. Heparin was found to exert dose- and hair cycle-dependent, differential effects on skin epithelial cell functions. Intraperitoneal, but not topical application of heparin inhibited the development of anagen follicles in anagen-induced mice as assessed by morphometry. When the skin of heparin-treated mice was cultured in an organ culture assay, the epidermis showed a significant increase in the synthesis of arginine-rich proteins (ARP), while epithelial bulb, but not epidermal cell proliferation was reduced in comparison with control skin. In mouse-skin organ culture, the effects of direct administration of heparin to the medium on epithelial cell proliferation and ARP synthesis were dose-dependent and varied (inhibition or stimulation of either parameter), depending on the stage of the hair cycle, the cell population in question (epidermal vs. epithelial bulb keratinocytes), and the length of incubation. PAM cell and mouse dermal papilla cell proliferation in vitro was inhibited by heparin. We conclude that heparin may be a useful tool for characterizing the role of GAG in epithelial cell biology and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in general, and in hair growth in particular.\r"

The mean sHA was significantly higher in the patients with PSS than in controls (mean +/- SD:80 +/- 43.4 micrograms/l vs. 42.3 +/- 19.1 micrograms/l, P less than 0.001). sHA was significantly higher in patients with proximal PSS than in patients with distal PSS (106.4 +/- 44.6 micrograms/l vs. 55.4 +/- 23.8 micrograms/l, P less than 0.001). A positive correlation was found between sHA and the disease score (r = 0.67, P less than 0.001). sHA was also correlated with lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (r = 0.70, P less than 0.001), but only in the those patients who had abnormal lung function, and therefore presumably had lung PSS involvement. We suggest that sHA could be an indicator of the degree of systemic involvement in PSS. Its prognostic value and possible use in the follow up of patients with PSS remain to be clarified.\r"

The mean and median chemiluminescence response were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in patients receiving 13-cis-retinoic acid than in untreated acne patients or age-matched controls. Pre-incubation of neutrophils with 13-cis-retinoic acid (10 nmol/l) did not affect the chemiluminescence response to formyl peptide. A sequential study over 20 weeks in seven patients demonstrated that chemiluminescence peaked after 2-8 weeks of treatment. In three patients this was accompanied by a worsening of their acne. These studies suggest that, in the initial phase, treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid may exacerbate, through pro-inflammatory priming of neutrophils, certain neutrophil-mediated inflammatory processes in acne.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen young male subjects with psoriasis (mean of 4.9% of skin surface area involvement) and 10 healthy controls underwent a heat exercise test (40 degrees C, 40% r.h.) for 2 h. Rectal temperature (Tr), mean skin temperature (Tsk), heart rate (HR) and heat storage (dS) were measured and calculated. A sharper rise was found for all parameters in the psoriatic patients as compared with controls. Statistically significant differences were found in Tr after 60 min (37.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 37.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C in patients and controls, respectively) and at termination of the exercise (38.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 37.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C). Heat storage at the end of the first hour was 78 +/- 9 and 30 +/- 7 kcal in patients and controls, respectively. At the end of 120 min, heat storage in the study group increased to 87 +/- 14 kcal, while the control group stored only 30 +/- 7 kcal. Sweat rate was lower in the psoriatic patients (590 +/- 49 g/h) than in controls (691 +/- 42 g/h), even when corrected for healthy skin area (337 +/- 26 g/h/m2 compared with 370 +/- 24 g/h/m2). It is suggested that psoriatic patients have a reduced ability to dissipate extra heat during exposure to exercise in the heat. Psoriasis should therefore be considered as a risk factor for heat intolerance.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the effectiveness of oral 8-methoxypsoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) using ultraviolet fluorescent lamps with peak emission at either 325, 352 or 370 nm in the treatment of 24 patients with psoriasis. The forearms of each patient were treated three times weekly with two of the three lamps. The erythemal sensitivity of each patient was tested before the first treatment to ensure that equally erythemal doses of radiation were given from each of the lamps. A side-to-side comparison was used to assess response to treatment at weekly intervals for the 6 weeks of the trial. The lamp with peak emission at 325 nm was shown to be significantly superior to either of the other lamps in terms of response assessed at weekly intervals, and time to clearance of psoriasis. An action spectrum, constructed from the median doses required for clearance of psoriasis using each of the lamps, showed that the effectiveness of the radiation decreased exponentially with increasing wavelength throughout the UVA waveband, such that radiation at 320 nm was an order of magnitude more effective than at 360 nm. This suggests that lamps with peak emission around 325 nm will be more effective than those conventionally used in PUVA units with a peak emission at 352 nm. Lamps with peak emission around 325 nm are also highly effective in the treatment of psoriasis with phototherapy alone. Thus a single treatment unit containing these lamps could be used either for PUVA or ultraviolet phototherapy of psoriasis, avoiding duplication or irradiation equipment.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective study of 643 cutaneous horns examined in our department between 1970 and 1989 revealed that 38.9% were derived from malignant or premalignant epidermal lesions, and 61.1% from benign lesions. Four main features were associated with premalignant or malignant histopathological change at the base of a cutaneous horn (base pathology). These were: (i) age--the mean age of the patients whose cutaneous horns showed premalignant or malignant base pathology was 8.9 years greater than the mean age of the patients where base pathology was benign (P less than 0.0005); (ii) sex--males were more likely to develop a cutaneous horn with (pre)malignant base pathology (P less than 0.001); (iii) site--over 70% of all (pre)malignant lesions were found on the nose, pinnae, backs of hands, scalp, forearms and the face; a cutaneous horn found at these sites was 2.1 times more likely to have derived from a (pre)malignant base than from any other part of the body (P less than 0.0001); (iv) geometry of the lesion--lesions with a wide base or a low height-to-base ratio were significantly more likely to show (pre)malignant base pathology. Of those solar keratoses giving rise to cutaneous horns, 8.9% also showed histological evidence of change to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); this figure was not significantly different from the 6.2% of solar keratoses without horns that showed SCC change during the same period (1970-89).\r"

Irradiation monochromator tests demonstrated an abnormal delay or reduction in the threshold to ultraviolet (UVB) irradiation-induced erythema similar to that of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). As with XP there was an elevated frequency of mutants resistant to 6-thioguanine in circulating T lymphocytes. The mutant frequency in a single obligate heterozygote was normal. In contrast to XP, in the two CS individuals studied, adaptive cell-mediated immunity and natural killer cell function were normal. Because the risk of skin cancer is very high in XP but not in CS, the normal immune function in CS provides evidence that immune surveillance may be important in UV tumorigenesis.\r"

SCF, in combination with interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) caused CD34+ cells to form increased numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colonies (CFU-GM), and to form macroscopic erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) in the presence of IL-3, erythropoietin (Epo), and SCF. We tested isolated CD34+lin- cells, a minor subset of CD34+ cells that did not display antigens associated with lymphoid or myeloid lineages, and CD34+lin+ cells, which contain the vast majority of CFC, and found that the enhanced colony growth was most dramatic within the CD34+lin- population. CD34+lin- cells cultured in liquid medium containing SCF combined with IL-3, GM-CSF, or G-CSF gave rise to increased numbers of CFC. Maximal numbers of CFU-GM were generated from CD34+lin- cells after 7 to 21 days of culture, and required the presence of SCF from the initiation of liquid culture. The addition of SCF to IL-3 and/or G-CSF in cultures of single CD34+lin- cells resulted in increased numbers of CFC due to the proliferation of otherwise quiescent precursors and an increase in the numbers of CFC generated from individual precursors. These studies demonstrate the potent synergistic interaction between SCF and other hematopoietic growth factors on a highly immature population of CD34+lin- precursor cells.\r"

At least 6.5 x 10(9) mononuclear cells/kg patient weight were collected from the peripheral blood of each patient, cyropreserved, and returned intravenously following CBV administration. Three patients had an early death 2, 22, and 25 days after PSCT. The actuarial event-free survival for these 56 patients at 3 years was 37% and was at least as good as that reported for relapsed Hodgkin's disease patients treated with CBV and ABMT. The 30 patients who had no marrow metastases at the time of PSC harvesting had an actuarial event-free survival of 47%, while those 26 patients with marrow metastases had a significantly different actuarial event-free survival of 27% (P = .02). CBV and PSCT for patients with relapsed Hodgkin's diseases who have marrow hypocellularity in traditional harvest sites or histopathologic evidence of BM metastases can result in long-term event-free survival.\r"

  ".W": "A liquid culture technique was used to study regulation of human megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro. Low-density cells from adult bone marrow were cultured in the presence of normal plasma, plasma from patients with aplastic marrows (AP), recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3). Megakaryocytes (MK) were studied at day 10 of culture by a two-color staining technique using a pool of monoclonal antibodies for their identification and propidium iodide to label DNA. Their ploidy distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. In some experiments cytoplasmic maturation was also studied by ultrastructural techniques. Normal plasma provides a low number of MK with a ploidy distribution including 8 N and 16 N MK. AP promoted in a dose-dependent manner proliferation of MK and some batches favored endoreplication. This effect was clearly demonstrated when ploidy distribution was compared between normal plasma and AP on parallel marrow cultures. However, ploidy distribution was shifted toward low values compared with uncultured MK. rhGM-CSF had no significant effect on these two parameters. In contrast, rhIL-3 from 0.1 U/mL to 100 U/mL had a proliferative effect but was unable to induce endoreplication. Furthermore, when associated with AP it totally abrogated the effect of AP on endoreplication because in most experiments more than 90% of MK were 2 N and 4 N. This effect was also observed when rhIL-3 was added after 7 days of culture (when it has little proliferative effects). Studies of the maturation of MK grown with rhIL-3 indicate that the majority were small mature cells synthesizing alpha-granules and demarcation membranes. The effect of AP on MK proliferation and endoreplication was not related to IL-6 because its IL-6 content was identical to that of normal plasma and its neutralization did not modify these parameters. In conclusion, this study indicates that liquid culture technique in association with flow cytometry could be a powerful tool in identifying the humoral regulators of human megakaryocytopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of several recombinant cytokines, including interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6, and IL-1 alpha, on megakaryocyte (MK) colony formation by a normal human bone marrow subpopulation (CD34+ DR+), enriched for the MK colony-forming unit (CFU-MK), was studied using a serum-depleted, fibrin clot culture system. IL-3 and GM-CSF, but not IL-6 or IL-1 alpha, stimulated MK colony formation by CD34+ DR+ cells. However, the addition of IL-1 alpha to CD34+ DR+ cultures containing IL-6 resulted in the appearance of CFU-MK-derived colonies, suggesting that IL-6 requires the presence of IL-1 alpha to exhibit its MK colony-stimulating activity (MK-CSA). Addition of neutralizing antibodies to IL-3 and GM-CSF, but not to IL-6 and IL-1 alpha, specifically inhibited the MK-CSA of IL-3 and GM-CSF, respectively. The addition of either anti-IL-6, anti-IL-1 alpha, or anti-IL-3 antisera to cultures containing both IL-6 and IL-1 alpha totally abolished the MK-CSA of the IL-6/IL-1 alpha combination. However, neither anti-IL-3 nor anti-GM-CSF antisera could totally neutralize the additive effect of the combination of IL-3 and GM-CSF on MK colony formation, indicating that these two cytokines act by affecting distinct effector pathways. These results suggest that while IL-3 and GM-CSF can directly affect CFU-MK-derived colony formation, IL-1 alpha and IL-6 act in concert to promote de novo elaboration of IL-3 and thereby promote CFU-MK proliferative capacity.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the interaction, in vitro, between diferric transferrin (FeTr), aluminum transferrin (AlTr), and human reticulocytes harvested from human placental blood. In particular, we aimed to determine the extent to which the kinetics of AlTr and FeTr differed. Using transferrin labeled with either 59Fe or 125I, the association of radiotracer with reticulocytes, as a function both of time and of transferrin concentration, was examined. Under the conditions of the experiments, the data are consistent with a mechanism involving at least three processes. Two early processes acting in parallel behave as a high-affinity saturable receptor and a low-affinity non-saturable receptor, neither of which distinguish between AlTr and FeTr. In a subsequent process, AlTr and FeTr exhibit different kinetics. This third process may be saturated by FeTr but not by AlTr. Interpreted in terms of a current conventional view of metallo-transferrin uptake, we conjecture that the early parallel processes involve cell surface phenomena including classical transferrin-receptor binding, and that the subsequent process represents events, possibly intracellular, involved in metallo-transferrin dissociation or further iron transport. The extent to which AlTr influences the interaction of FeTr with reticulocytes offers insight into both the normal physiology of iron uptake and the potential for toxicity by aluminum.\r"

  ".W": "Human hematopoietic colony-forming cells (CFC) express the CD34 antigen (CD34+) as well as differentiation antigens such as CD33 and HLA-DR. CD34+ cells that do not express these latter differentiation antigens have been shown to contain few CFC in direct culture, but generate increasing numbers of CFC when cultured over a marrow stromal cell layer in the long-term culture system. In this study we determined if CD34+ cells with low or absent expression of CD33 and a novel antigen, 7B9 (CD34+CD33-7B9-), could be distinguished from CD34+ cells expressing these antigens (CD34+CD33+7B9+) based on their proliferative responses to interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in a short-term liquid culture system. These two populations were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, cultured with IL-3 (10 ng/mL), G-CSF (100 ng/mL), or IL-3 and G-CSF, and 3H-thymidine uptake was measured. CD34+CD33-7B9- cells proliferated in the presence of IL-3, but not G-CSF. However, a synergistic response to the combination of IL-3 and G-CSF was seen in most experiments. In contrast, CD34+CD33+7B9+ cells proliferated in the presence of either IL-3 or G-CSF but did not display an additive or synergistic response to the combination of IL-3 and G-CSF. In colony-forming assays performed before and after liquid culture, the CD34+CD33-7B9- cells in two experiments contained 0.3% and 2.2% of all sorted marrow CFC before liquid culture and generated 40-fold and ninefold increases in the number of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), respectively, after liquid culture with IL-3 and G-CSF. In contrast, the CD34+CD33+7B9+ cells contained 99.7% and 97.8% of all sorted marrow CFC before liquid culture and had no change or a threefold increase in the number of CFU-GM, respectively, after liquid culture with IL-3 and G-CSF. Single-cell liquid cultures containing IL-3 and G-CSF with cells that were either CD34+CD33-7B9- and depleted of mature lymphoid cells (CD34+lin-) or were CD34+lin+ showed that a higher proportion of wells containing a CD34+lin- cell gave rise to one or more CFC (8.7%) than did wells containing a CD34+lin+ cell (2.9%), with the responding cells in the former population giving rise to an average of 2.9 +/- 0.6 CFC and in the latter population, 2.0 +/- 1.0 CFC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) and erythropoietin (Epo) were measured in 27 and 163 cases, respectively. Total nucleated cell and platelet counts did not change from the 18th to the 30th week of gestation. The lymphocytes represented the main population and the decrease of normoblastic cells made up for the increase in neutrophils. The increase of red blood cells and hemoglobin was substantial during the studied period. At mid trimester threefold more BFU-E were obtained than at birth. Epo levels remained stable throughout the pregnancy and no correlation was found between Epo and gestational age. These normal values of fetal erythropoiesis will improve our knowledge of physiology and provide a better insight into developmental hematopoiesis.\r"

Also analyzed were the radioprotective effects of simultaneous as well as sequential combinations of rG-CSF and rGM-CSF. Our findings in 1,180 mice provide direct evidence that in vivo administration of rG-CSF or rGM-CSF before TBI protects a significant fraction of mice from the lethal effects of LD100/30 TBI. At equivalent doses, rG-CSF displayed a more potent radioprotective activity than rGM-CSF. Not only was rG-CSF radioprotective at much smaller doses than rGM-CSF, the survival rate after lethal TBI was also significantly higher in mice receiving optimally radioprotective doses of rG-CSF as compared with mice receiving optimally radioprotective doses of rGM-CSF. Pretreatment of mice with rGM-CSF markedly attenuated the radioprotective affects of rG-CSF in lethally as well as supralethally irradiated mice. Pretreatment with rG-CSF followed by rGM-CSF was slightly more effective than rG-CSF alone in supralethally irradiated mice but not in lethally irradiated mice. Notably, marked differences among different strains of mice were noted regarding the optimally radioprotective doses of rG-CSF or rGM-CSF as well as probability of survival and median survival time after lethal or supralethal TBI. This report confirms and extends previous studies concerning the potential of cytokines in prevention or therapy of lethal radiation injury.\r"

Seven patients with acute leukemia who had been transfused during induction therapy were used as the test group, and, as a control group, five untransfused patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were also studied. Concurrent fibrinogen survival measurements were performed in all patients to assess whether hemostatic factor consumption (ie, disseminated intravascular coagulation) was present. Allogeneic platelet survival measurements were reduced from normal in all 12 study patients. In 8 of 12 patients, fibrinogen and platelet survival measurements were comparably reduced, suggesting disease-related platelet consumption. In four heavily transfused patients with acute leukemia, allogeneic platelet survivals were markedly reduced to less than or equal to 2.1 days, compared with the 3.5- to 7.4-day platelet survival measurements found in the other eight patients. The disproportionately short platelet survivals compared with fibrinogen survival measurements in these four patients, combined with documented positive antibody tests to their donors' platelets in the three patients with evaluable tests, suggested that these patients had become alloimmunized to platelets because of their prior transfusions. There was substantial concordance between the two radiolabeled allogeneic donor platelet survival measurements performed in each of these patients, suggesting that host rather than donor factors have a major influence on transfusion outcome (r = .93, P less than .001). The platelet cross-match tests, using the radiolabeled protein Staph A assay combined with the IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, had the best correlation with the posttransfusion recovery and survival of the donors' platelets.\r"

Cell-free supernatants prepared from n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-stimulated PMN were able also to induce platelet activation. Antibodies against cathepsin G and different serin protease inhibitors completely suppressed the activity of PMN-derived supernatants, indicating that cathepsin G is the major platelet activator released by PMN in our system. However, antiproteinases only partially affected platelet activation induced by PMN in mixed cell suspensions. Superoxide dismutase and catalase added to the cell suspension did not affect platelet activation nor potentiated serin protease inhibitors, making a role for short-lived oxygen radicals in our experimental system unlikely. Electron microscopic observation of stirred mixed cell suspensions preincubated for 2 minutes at 37 degrees C before stimulation showed a close PMN-platelets contact without any morphologic or biochemical event suggesting platelet activation. Preincubation of the cells without stirring to minimize PMN-platelet interaction before stimulation did not modify subsequent aggregation and platelet cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase in control samples. However, in this condition trypsin inhibitor from soybean completely prevented PMN-induced platelet activation. In samples preincubated without stirring in the presence of the antiproteinase, activated PMN stuck together but platelets preserved their discoid shape and did not appear significantly activated. We propose that membrane-to-membrane contact could create a microenvironment in which cathepsin G, discharged from stimulated PMN on adherent platelets, is protected from antiproteinases.\r"

  ".W": "The interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) is expressed as a 140-Kd membrane glycoprotein that binds IL-4 with high affinity. Recently, cDNA clones for the murine IL-4R have been isolated. One clone encodes an integral membrane protein, while another encodes a protein in which translation is terminated before the transmembrane region, thus producing a soluble form of the IL-4R (sIL-4R). HeLa cell clones overexpressing sIL-4R were isolated using a novel filter-overlay and 125I-IL-4 ligand binding technique. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the kinetics and affinity of IL-4 binding to the recombinant sIL-4R were similar to the native membrane-bound IL-4R. As low doses of sIL-4R specifically inhibited IL-4-induced proliferative responses in vitro, sIL-4R biodistribution and elimination parameters were evaluated to assess the pharmacokinetic potential of sIL-4R as a therapeutic agent. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that radiolabeled sIL-4R had a distribution half-life of 9 minutes and an elimination half-life of 2.3 hours following intravenous (IV) administration. When administered by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous (SC) injection, the elimination half-lives were prolonged to 4.2 hours and 6.2 hours, respectively. Although the initial blood level of sIL-4R was reduced if administered by SC injection, the bioavailability was comparable with IV administration. The main sites of sIL-4R elimination were the liver and kidney.\r"

  ".U": "91249089\r", 
  ".W": "The use of immunotoxins (IT) to selectively destroy acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vivo or in vitro is complicated by both the antigenic similarity of AML cells to normal progenitor cells and the difficulty of producing a sufficiently toxic conjugate. The monoclonal antibody (MoAb) anti-MY9 is potentially ideal for selective recognition of AML cells because it reacts with an antigen (CD33) found on clonogenic AML cells from greater than 80% of cases and does not react with normal pluripotent stem cells. In this study, we describe an immunotoxin that is selectively active against CD33+ AML cells: Anti-MY9-blocked-Ricin (Anti-MY9-bR), comprised of anti-MY9 conjugated to a modified whole ricin that has its nonspecific binding eliminated by chemical blockage of the galactose binding domains of the B-chain. A limiting dilution assay was used to measure elimination of HL-60 leukemic cells from a 20-fold excess of normal bone marrow cells. Depletion of CD33+ HL-60 cells was found to be dependent on the concentration of Anti-MY9-bR and on the duration of incubation with IT at 37 degrees C. More than 4 logs of these leukemic cells were specifically depleted following short exposure to high concentrations (10(-8) mol/L) of Anti-MY9-bR. Incubation with much lower concentrations of Anti-MY9-bR (10(-10) mol/L), as compatible with in vivo administration, resulted in 2 logs of depletion of HL-60 cells, but 48 to 72 hours of continuous exposure were required. Anti-MY9-bR was also shown to be toxic to primary AML cells, with depletion of greater than 2 logs of clonogenic cells following incubation with Anti-MY9-bR 10(-8) mol/L at 37 degrees C for 5 hours. Activity of Anti-MY9-bR could be blocked by unconjugated Anti-MY9 but not by galactose. As expected, Anti-MY9-bR was toxic to normal colony-forming unit granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM), which expresses CD33, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and also to burst-forming unit-erythroid and CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte, although to a lesser extent. When compared with anti-MY9 and complement (C'), Anti-MY9-bR could be used in conditions that provided more effective depletion of AML cells with substantially less depletion of normal CFU-GM. Therefore, Anti-MY9-bR may have clinical utility for in vitro purging of AML cells from autologous marrow when used at high IT concentrations for short incubation periods. Much lower concentrations of Anti-MY9-bR that can be maintained for longer periods may be useful for elimination of AML cells in vivo.\r"

It has been suggested that IL-6 is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases by autocrine or paracrine pathways. To examine whether IL-6 is possibly involved in the pathophysiology of Hodgkin's disease (HD), we analyzed the expression of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor mRNA and protein in cell lines and primary specimens from patients with HD. IL-6-specific transcripts were detected in three of six HD-derived cell lines by Northern blot analysis. In the culture supernatants of four HD-derived cell lines, IL-6 was detected by radioimmunoassay. Biologic activity of IL-6 was confirmed by proliferation of an IL-6-dependent cell line. In situ hybridization experiments showed IL-6-specific transcripts in Hodgkin (H) and Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells in primary tissues of two patients. In addition, mRNAs specific for the IL-6 receptor were detected in five HD-derived cell lines. Immunostaining experiments showed expression of IL-6 receptor molecules on H and RS cells in 8 of 16 cases with HD. Thus, our data suggest that IL-6 might be involved in the pathophysiology of HD.\r"

  ".W": "Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) occurs endemically in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, and West Africa, but occurs sporadically in most of the rest of the world. However, because ATLL and non-HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms share overlapping clinicopathologic features, the prevalence of ATLL in nonendemic regions is unknown. In this study, 75 T-cell neoplasms randomly procured from the metropolitan New York City area were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of integrated HTLV-I proviral sequences. HTLV-I genomic sequences were detected by PCR in 6 of the 75 cases (8%); this result was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. The clinicopathologic features of the HTLV-I positive and HTLV-I negative T-cell neoplasms were then compared. Although the clinicopathologic features of patients from these two groups overlapped, some findings were more commonly associated with HTLV-I positive neoplasms. Five of the six patients with HTLV-I positive neoplasms were from HTLV-I endemic areas, five were black, five were women, and five were less than 45 years of age, while the majority of the patients with HTLV-I negative T-cell malignancies were elderly white men. The incidence of hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions was significantly more common among patients with HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms (P less than .001 and P = .004, respectively). The immunophenotypes of the HTLV-I positive and negative tumors were similar; however, all HTLV-I positive neoplasms were CD7 negative (P less than .001). In summary, our findings: (1) demonstrate the special clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features of HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms, (2) suggest that most of the rare cases of HTLV-I-associated T-cell neoplasms occurring in HTLV-I nonendemic areas are actually endemic cases; and (3) that PCR is a sensitive, clinically useful technique for identifying HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms.\r"

We have previously reported a consistent pattern of novel sites of methylation in the 5' region of the calcitonin (CT) gene and other chromosome 11p loci in acute myelogenous and and lymphoid leukemias. In the present study, CT gene methylation patterns were investigated in peripheral blood from 51 patients with CML. Abnormal patterns were found in only 2 of 31 patients in chronic phase, but in 5 of 8 patients in accelerated phase, and in 11 of 12 patients in blast crisis (P less than .005). For one patient studied in blast crisis, abnormal CT gene methylation was found in the peripheral blast cells but not in the granulocytes. In two of three patients studied with CML and having normal peripheral cell patterns, abnormal patterns were found in marrow blast cells. In one patient, only partial normalization of the CT gene methylation pattern was seen after chemotherapy induction of a second chronic phase and the patient relapsed 5 months later. Our findings indicate that abnormal methylation of the 5' region of the CT gene is regularly a marker of disease progression in CML which may prove clinically useful. This abnormal methylation site is part of an imbalance in DNA methylation that may play a role in the progressive genetic instability which characterizes the advancing stages of CML.\r"

  ".W": "Calcitonin gene methylation at CCGG sites were determined in 39 chronic myeloid leukemia patients by isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease analysis. A total of 27 patients were analyzed while still in the chronic phase: 20 patients had a normal gene, and seven had a hypermethylated gene. There were 12 patients initially studied in accelerated or blastic phases. All but one patient showed gene hypermethylation, suggesting a good correlation between gene methylation and disease stage. All five patients who, while still in the chronic phase, had a major 3.1-kb hypermethylated calcitonin gene fragment, accelerated within 2 to 27 months. In consecutively analyzed patients, the initially normal calcitonin gene changed to a hypermethylated state as the disease escalated. The hypermethylation predicted disease acceleration with a median lead time of 6 months before any morphologic or clinical signs of disease progression were seen. The disease progressed in 8 of 27 patients initially studied in the chronic phase: in only two patients this occurred without predictive methylation changes. The results suggest that the assessment of calcitonin gene methylation status may be a promising tool for monitoring chronic myeloid leukemia disease escalation.\r"

A point mutation in the coding sequence of the p53 gene first appeared concomitantly with the blast crisis and then disappeared with the re-establishment of a second chronic phase. The chromosomal concomitant of the molecular alteration was a deletion of 17p. These observations suggest that abnormalities of the p53 anti-oncogene are temporally related to the clinical progression of some cases of CML and are probably responsible for the development of blast crisis in these cases.\r"

  ".W": "The bone marrow stromal cell-derived growth factor interleukin-7 (IL-7) is known to stimulate growth of normal human B-cell precursors. In the present report, we have examined the effect of IL-7 on neoplastic B-cell precursors. Leukemic cells from 20 patients with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were highly purified by removing contaminating T cells and monocytes by rosetting with immunomagnetic beads. IL-7 markedly reduced the DNA synthesis in leukemic cells from three patients. This inhibition of DNA synthesis was accompanied by maturation of the cells, as demonstrated by the induced expression of the differentiation antigens CD19, CD20, CDw75, and surface mu-chain, and a decreased expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. By examining G1 parameters, such as MYC, 4F2, and transferrin-receptor levels analyzed by flow cytometry as well as RNA and the cell cycle regulated antigen Ki67, it appeared that the cells were inhibited late in G1. Leukemic cells from the majority of the cases (12 of the 20 patients) responded to IL-7 with enhanced DNA synthesis without detectable maturation, as has been reported for their normal counterparts. Low molecular weight B-cell growth factor greatly potentiated the IL-7-induced growth stimulation of these cells. Thus, we have shown that IL-7 is capable of inhibiting proliferation of leukemic cells isolated from a subgroup of ALLs, and that this growth inhibition is accompanied by maturation of the cells.\r"

Seven of eight patients with hypercalcemia showed elevation of serum TNF-beta. On the other hand, TNF-beta could not be detected by the ELISA in 28 patients without hypercalcemia. The lower detection limit in this assay was 100 pg/mL, corresponding to 500 pg/mL by the conventional method. In two patients serum TNF-beta level decreased after treatment in association with the level of serum calcium. Furthermore, immuno-staining using anti-TNF-beta and avidin-biotin complex showed the presence of cytoplasmic TNF-beta in not only human T-cell leukemia virus type I infected cell lines, but also freshly isolated cells from ATL patients with hypercalcemia. The actual biologic activity of TNF-beta in serum was confirmed by a conventional bioassay in a patient with hypercalcemia, and its cytotoxic activity was inhibited by the addition of anti-TNF-beta antibody in the assay. These results suggested that serum TNF-beta might be one of the factors contributing to the hypercalcemia, at least in patients with ATL.\r"

  ".U": "91249097\r", 
  ".W": "Bone marrow cells from two pediatric patients completing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied using in situ hybridization with an alpha-satellite DNA probe specific for chromosome 17. Morphologic analysis of the end-therapy specimens from each patient had shown small numbers (7.5%, 8.5%) of cells that were suspicious for residual or recurrent disease. These cells could not be morphologically or immunophenotypically distinguished with certainty from immature lymphoid cells (hematogones), which may be present normally, sometimes in increased numbers, in the bone marrow specimens of children. In situ hybridization with a probe to chromosome 17 was used because the leukemic cells from each patient had originally been shown to have an extra copy of this chromosome. In one patient, in situ studies showed a population of cells (106 of 1,000 cells) with three hybridization signals indicating trisomy 17, and thus residual/recurrent leukemia. In the other patient trisomy 17 could not be detected. Additional hybridizations to previously stained bone marrow aspirate smears permitted a direct correlation of the cytogenetic findings with the suspicious cells on a cell-to-cell basis. The questionable cells were identified, photographed, and then re-examined after hybridization. In one patient, 13 of 18 (72%) of the suspicious cells were found to have trisomy 17, whereas in the other patient 0 of 24 (0%) demonstrated an extra copy of this chromosome. These cases illustrate a clinical application of interphase cytogenetic analysis and demonstrate how this technology can be used for direct correlation of cytogenetic findings with cell morphology. This technique should prove useful for the detection of minimal residual disease and for lineage studies in leukemia and myelodysplasia.\r"

Upon intraperitoneal (IP) transfer, cells from relapse samples of three children with T-lineage ALL spread hematogenously and infiltrated the non-lymphoid and/or lymphoid organs with a pattern reminiscent of the human clinical disease. These mice either died or were killed in extremis at a mean of 9 weeks. Moreover, cell lines established in vitro from two of these samples manifested identical homing and progression in the SCID mouse as compared with the original patients' cells. Thus, long-term culture of the primary leukemic T cells did not alter their invasive potential and migration pattern. When engrafted IP, three cell lines established from pre-B-ALL cases displayed primarily a lymphatic spread with induction of local tumor masses and kidney/liver nodules. Mice were killed at 11 to 13 weeks, but had not developed imminently fatal leukemia. However, when transferred intravenously, one pre-B ALL cell line was able to spread hematogenously and to infiltrate both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Overall, these data demonstrate that the SCID mouse provides an efficient and reproducible model to study the pathogenesis of childhood ALL, and may be a suitable system for evaluating therapy.\r"

Previous studies have linked either excessive MP release or reduced TIMP-1 production to the invasive and metastatic phenotypes of cancer cells. In the present study we investigated the relationship between the expression of TIMP-1 and the clinical behavior of 28 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Northern blot analysis showed that levels of TIMP-1 mRNAs correlated directly with clinical aggressiveness: tumors in the high-grade category contained the highest levels of TIMP-1 transcripts approaching those found in maximally growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts in vitro. In situ hybridization localized the TIMP-1 expression to stromal cells of endothelial and fibroblastic origin. In contrast, transcripts hybridizing with metalloproteinase gene probes (interstitial collagenase and 72-Kd type IV collagenase) were expressed at very low levels in malignant lymphomas and their expression was not coordinately regulated with that of TIMP-1. The majority of tumors expressed either interstitial collagenase or 72-Kd type IV collagenase, and only a small number expressed both. Interstitial collagenase transcripts were only detected in high-grade tumors. The relative levels of TIMP-1 expression did not correlate with the degree of fibrosis of the tumors. Our data suggest the importance of tumor-stromal interactions in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and moreover, our results indicate a possible relationship between high-level, localized expression of TIMP-1 and the malignant phenotype of high-grade advanced-stage lymphomas.\r"

In X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (Xb- CGD) the phagocytes are defective in the beta-subunit (gp91-phox) of this cytochrome. We have studied the genetic defect in a group of six X-linked CGD patients characterized by complete or partial loss of cytochrome b558 with the use of the polymerase chain reaction. All patients had a different single point mutation in the gp91-phox gene, indicating that the genetic defect in Xb- CGD is very heterogeneous. In one patient the mutation leads to a premature termination codon. In the other five cases these mutations predict incorporation of a different amino acid. The mutations were with one exception found in the N-terminal half of the protein, suggesting that this part of cytochrome b558 is important for the binding of the heme or for formation of a stable complex with p22-phox. Two histidyl residues were found that might be ligands of the heme iron.\r"

The sequencing data, compared with previously published sequences for the normal chromosomes A and B, show many similarities to chromosome B for haplotypes 19, 20, and 17, while haplotypes 3 and 31 are remarkably similar to chromosome A and also similar to each other. Several unique mutations were found in the 5' flanking regions (G gamma and A gamma) of haplotypes 19 and 20 and in the IVS-II segments of the same genes of haplotypes 19, 20, and 17; the IVS-II of haplotypes 3 and 31 were identical to those of chromosome A. Dot-blot analyses of amplified DNA from additional SS patients with specific probes have confirmed that these mutations are unique for each haplotype. The two general patterns that have been observed among the five haplotypes have most probably arisen by gene conversion events between the A and B type chromosomes in the African population. These patterns correlate with high and low fetal hemoglobin expression, and it is speculated that these and other yet unknown gene conversions may contribute to the variations in hemoglobin F and G gamma levels observed among SS patients. In vitro expression experiments involving the approximately 1.3-kb 5' flanking regions of the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes of the beta S chromosomes with the five different haplotypes failed to detect differences between the levels of expression, suggesting that the sequence variations observed between these segments of DNA are not the primary cause of the differences in hemoglobin F levels among the SS patients.\r"

In transgenic mice bled from a hematocrit of 55% to one of 10%, hepatocytes surrounding central veins synthesized large amounts of human EPO mRNA. EPO-producing cells were very rare in the area of portal triads. In transgenic mice bled to a hematocrit of 20%, a similar number and distribution of cells contained human EPO mRNA as was found with a 10% hematocrit, but the cells were less heavily labeled, indicating increased EPO production per cell at 10% hematocrit as compared with 20% hematocrit. No human EPO mRNA was detected in the kidneys of anemic transgenic mice, although endogenous murine EPO mRNA was strongly expressed in cortical interstitial cells. In sections of livers from nontransgenic mice bled from a hematocrit of 45% to one of 10%, only isolated cells produced EPO. When the types of cells could clearly be identified, approximately 80% of these cells were hepatocytes, while 20% had a nonepithelial morphology and were located in or adjacent to the sinusoidal spaces. When the sense strand was used as the RNA probe for in situ hybridization, no labeled cells were seen in normal or anemic livers. These results demonstrate that hepatocytes are responsible for production of EPO in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice and that a second cell type that is similar in morphology to EPO-producing interstitial cells in the kidney also produces EPO in the livers of nontransgenic mice.\r"

Increasingly sensitive detection methods have shown that MC occurs frequently. We report a highly sensitive novel method to assess MC based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Simple dinucleotide repeat sequences called microsatellites have been found to vary in their repeat number between individuals. We use this variation to type donor-recipient pairs following allogeneic BMT. A panel of seven microsatellites was used to distinguish between donor and recipient cells of 32 transplants. Informative microsatellites were subsequently used to assess MC after BMT in this group of patients. Seventeen of the 32 transplants involved a donor of opposite sex; hence, cytogenetics and Y chromosome-specific PCR were also used as an index of chimerism in these patients. MC was detected in bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood in 18 of 32 patients (56%) by PCR. In several cases, only stored slide material was available for analysis but PCR of microsatellites or Y chromosomal material could be used successfully to assess the origin of cells in this archival material. Cytogenetic analysis was possible in 17 patients and MC was detected in three patients. Twelve patients received T-cell-depleted marrow and showed a high incidence of MC as revealed by PCR (greater than 80%). Twenty patients received unmanipulated marrow, and while the incidence of MC was lower (44%), this was a high percentage when compared with other studies. Once MC was detected, the percentages of recipient cells tended to increase. However, in patients exhibiting MC who subsequently relapsed, this increase was relatively sudden. The overall level of recipient cells in the group of MC patients who subsequently relapsed was higher than in those who exhibited stable MC. Thus, while the occurrence of MC was not indicative of a poor prognosis per se, sudden increases in the proportions of recipient cells may be a prelude to graft rejection or relapse.\r"

  ".W": "Graft rejection, mixed chimerism, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), leukemia relapse, and tolerance are interrelated manifestations of immunologic reactivity between donor and host cells that significantly affect survival after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In this report, a mouse model of BMT, in which the donor and host were compatible at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), was used (1) to examine the interrelationship of pretransplant conditioning and T-cell content of donor BM with regard to lymphoid chimerism and GVHD and (2) to determine how these factors affected graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity and donor-host-tolerance. AKR (H-2k) host mice were administered optimal or suboptimal total body irradiation (TBI) as pretransplant conditioning followed by administration of BM cells from B10.BR (H-2k) donor mice with or without added spleen cells as a source of T lymphocytes. Transplanted mice were injected with a supralethal dose of AKR leukemia cells 20 and 45 days post-BMT to assess GVL reactivity in vivo. The pretransplant conditioning of the host and T-cell content of the donor marrow affected the extent of donor T-cell chimerism and the severity of GVH disease. GVL reactivity was dependent on transplantation of mature donor T cells and occurred only in complete chimeras. Transplantation of T-cell-deficient BM resulted in the persistence of host T cells, ie, incomplete donor T-cell chimerism, even when lethal TBI was used. Mixed chimerism was associated with a lack of GVL reactivity, despite the fact that similar numbers of donor T cells were present in the spleens of mixed and complete chimeras. In this model, moderate numbers of donor T cells facilitated complete donor T-cell engraftment, caused only mild GVHD, and provided a significant GVL effect without preventing the subsequent development of tolerance after conditioning with suboptimal TBI. In contrast, severe, often lethal, GVHD developed when the dose of TBI was increased, whereas tolerance and no GVH/GVL reactivity developed when the T-cell content of the marrow was decreased.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-nine patients with a history of low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in sensitive relapse or incomplete first remission underwent high-dose chemoradiotherapy and anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody (MoAb)-treated autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). At ABMT, 51 patients had low-grade histology and 18 patients had a history of low-grade NHL that had undergone histologic transformation to a higher-grade NHL. Before ABMT, only 20 of the 51 low-grade patients and 10 of the 18 patients with transformed histologies were in complete remission. Moreover, at the time of marrow harvest, 24 of the low-grade and eight of the transformed histology patients had histologic evidence of lymphoma cells infiltrating the marrow. Following high-dose therapy, only one acute, in-hospital death was observed. There was no significant difference in the disease-free survival (DFS) between patients with low-grade and patients with transformed histologies. Among patients with low-grade NHL, the patients in complete remission before ABMT experienced significantly longer DFS than those in partial remission (P less than .05). This preliminary study suggests that some patients with relapsed low-grade NHL may experience prolonged DFS following high-dose ablative therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The use of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and UV-A irradiation to inactivate contaminating donor leukocytes in platelet concentrates and to prevent primary alloimmunization against donor class I major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens in mice was investigated. CBA/CaH-T6J mice with the H2k haplotype and BALB/cByJ mice with the H2d haplotype were used as donors and recipients, respectively. The mixed leukocyte reaction between these two strains of mice showed that treatment of spleen cells with 500 ng/mL 8-MOP and 5J/cm2 UV-A inhibited 99% of responder and 92% of stimulator function. There was no measurable loss of platelet aggregating activity after the treatment. After two weekly transfusions of platelets without any treatment, 93% of control mice (n = 15) developed anti-H2k antibody. In contrast, only 33% of mice (n = 15) receiving platelets treated with 8-MOP and UV-A became alloimmunized. After six weekly platelet transfusions, all mice became alloimmunized. Nevertheless, the mean titers of anti-H2k antibody in sera of the treated groups were significantly lower than the control groups. One hour posttransfusion recoveries of 51Cr-labeled donor platelets were also higher in mice transfused with the treated platelets. Thus, the pretreatment of platelet concentrates with 8-MOP and UV-A irradiation effectively reduced the alloantigenicity of class I MHC molecules. The implication of this finding in relation to the mechanism by which donor leukocytes allosensitize recipients is discussed.\r"

DESIGN--Closed questionnaires given to parents of children with sickle cell disease and general practitioners in Brent. Urine samples from 23 children were tested for penicillin. SETTING--Paediatric haematology clinic, Central Middlesex Hospital, and general practices in Brent. SUBJECTS--50 children (aged less than or equal to 16) attending clinic with sickle cell disease over six months (33 HbSS, 12 HbSC, five HbS beta thalassaemia). 30 general practitioners: 15 with the greatest number of patients with sickle cell disease on the Brent register; 15 selected randomly from family practitioner committee's list. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Reported compliance with and awareness of importance of penicillin prophylaxis. Results of urine tests for penicillin. RESULTS--31 parents claimed that their children received penicillin every day and 19 that they received it most days (greater than or equal to 5 days a week). Penicillin was detected in only 10 of 23 urine samples tested. Parents and doctors seemed not to appreciate the importance of treatment: only eight parents were aware of the risk of death if penicillin were discontinued, and 16 doctors were unaware that regular penicillin prophylaxis prevents pneumococcal septicaemia and death in these children. CONCLUSIONS--Education for families with children with sickle cell disease must be improved. Specialised information and training are needed for doctors working in areas with a high prevalence of the disorder.\r"

DESIGN--Postal questionnaire survey of general practitioners. SETTING--Bristol and Weston health district. SUBJECTS--226 general practitioners, of whom 171 replied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Scores of quality and quantity of hospital and community services, frequency that services were identified as priorities for improvement, and the nature of written comments received about services. RESULTS--There was considerable agreement among respondents about which services were adequate and which were inadequate. Most services were perceived as at least adequate in both quality and quantity, but seven services were perceived by more than 60% (102) of doctors as inadequate or worse in quantity and eight by 10% (17) of doctors as poor in quality. Orthopaedics, ophthalmology, care of elderly people, and physiotherapy were the services doctors most wanted improved. CONCLUSIONS--A postal questionnaire is an acceptable and accurate method of obtaining general practitioners' views about services available to their patients. General practitioners' priorities differ from those obtained from hospital medical advisory mechanisms.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised, double blind, parallel group study. Treatment lasted for six weeks. Frequency of micturition and episodes of incontinence recorded on diary chart by patients. SETTING--Incontinence clinic and a geriatric day hospital at two teaching hospitals. PATIENTS--37 frail but ambulant patients, mean (range) age 80.4 (70-89) years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence, due to detrusor instability. Two patients withdrew before the first assessment (one in each group) and one could not complete the diary chart (placebo group). INTERVENTIONS--19 patients received bladder retraining and terodiline 25 mg daily and 18 bladder retraining and placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Change in urinary frequency and number of episodes of incontinence after six weeks' treatment. Patient's subjective evaluation of symptoms. RESULTS--Little difference was found in the results of treatment with terodiline and placebo. The change in episodes of incontinence per 24 hours was no different in the two groups (95% confidence interval -0.6 to 1.2; p = 0.75) and the difference between treatments in the change in frequency of micturition per 24 hours (-0.2) was not significant (-1.1 to 1.2; p = 0.76). Ten patients taking terodiline thought they had improved compared with seven receiving placebo; this difference was not significant. CONCLUSION--Although the number of patients in each group was small and may have been insufficient to detect a drug effect, the possible benefit of terodiline is likely to be small.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the efficiency of referral for suspected glaucoma to general practitioners and consultants by optometrists. DESIGN--A prospective survey covering 5% of all sight tests performed by optometrists in England and Wales over six months, with analysis of referred patients. SETTING--241 optometrists' practices in areas representative of England and Wales in socioeconomic terms. SUBJECTS--Of 275,600 people attending for a sight test, 1505 were referred with suspected glaucoma (0.9% of those aged over 4%). Outcomes were recorded for 1228 patients, 1103 (90%) of whom attended for examination by a consultant ophthalmologist (8% on a private basis). The analysis was confined to the 704 cases in which the information on diagnosis was received directly from a consultant or general practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diagnoses reported by consultant ophthalmologists. Waiting times before an appointment for examination by a consultant ophthalmologist. RESULTS--Glaucoma was confirmed in 283 of the 704 referred patients, and another 222 patients were considered to require further monitoring. In all, 112 (41%) of 275 confirmed cases of glaucoma were in patients with intraocular pressures greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg. At all levels of intraocular pressure the accuracy of referral was greater when the optometrist also recorded the presence of suspicious optic discs or loss of visual field, or both; but only 331 (47%) out of the 704 referred patients had been tested with a field screener. The median waiting time for an NHS clinic appointment was nine weeks. Almost a 10th of confirmed cases of glaucoma were in people in a high risk category for glaucoma who had to wait at least 14 weeks for an appointment. CONCLUSIONS--Closer cooperation, especially at the local level, among consultants, general practitioners, and optometrists is needed to improve testing and referral for suspected glaucoma. Optometrists should be encouraged to perform all the three main tests--ophthalmoscopy, tonometry, and perimetry--in patients before referral and to report precisely on reasons for referral to help prioritisation. The optometrist's referral letter to the general practitioner should always be passed on to the consultant. Similarly, the diagnosis should always be reported back to the optometrist.\r"

This suggests that direct surgical trauma to the upper genitourinary system may inhibit bladder function. We therefore suggest that pre-operative catheterisation should be considered in theatre, for patients undergoing pyeloplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Subjective and objective methods of demonstrating incontinence and assessing its severity have been compared in a group of elderly patients with a high incidence of severe urge incontinence. It was found that 24-h in-patient monitoring of urine leakage was the most sensitive method of demonstrating incontinence, with videourodynamic testing almost as good. In comparison, a 1-h pad test was poor. Visual inspection during physical examination seldom demonstrated leakage. For quantitative assessment of severity, 24-h monitoring gave the most reproducible results; it was also able to reveal significant changes in severity in response to pharmaceutical treatment. A 1-h pad test was less reproducible and suggested changes that were only poorly consistent with 24-h monitoring. The subjective responses of the patients were not useful in assessing changes in the severity of incontinence. Twenty-four hour monitoring thus stands out as a superior method of demonstrating and assessing incontinence.\r"

Three important diagnostic features are emphasised: symptoms referable to neurogenic bladder without an obvious neurogenic lesion (all 15 patients); skin or hair abnormalities in the lumbosacral region (9/15) and paraesthesia or other neurological disorders of the lower extremities (8/15). The definitive diagnosis can be made by careful inspection of a plain film of the lumbosacrum. Detrusor contractility was absent in 13 patients but preserved in 2; 11 patients were managed by clean intermittent catheterisation, 2 voided using detrusor contractility and 2 voided by means of the Valsalva/Crede manoeuvre. In 5 patients surgery in the intradural space preserved sexual function and prevented further deterioration in function of the lower extremities but could not restore bladder function that had already deteriorated. Complete continence was achieved in 11 patients and socially acceptable continence in 4. Early diagnosis and conservative treatment with clean intermittent catheterisation are extremely important in management. Should functional deterioration of the bladder and/or sensomotor function of the lower limbs occur, neurosurgery should be performed promptly.\r"

In some cases they were detectable 3 years after the initial examination but were completely absent from the colorectal mucosa of normal subjects. Metabolic disturbances (metabolic acidosis, increased anion gap, hyperchloraemia) were observed in a substantial number of asymptomatic patients. These findings stress the need for regular endoscopic, histological and metabolic follow-up in these patients and for life-long treatment with bicarbonate or citrate.\r"

Saturation experiments using 125I-Heat demonstrated that the density and binding affinity of alpha 1 adrenoceptors in the prostate capsules obtained from men with symptomatic and asymptomatic BPH were similar. Non-cumulative dose response experiments using phenylephrine demonstrated that the magnitude of the contractile response to phenylephrine was 4-fold greater in the prostate capsules from men with symptomatic BPH than from those with asymptomatic BPH. The EC50 of phenylephrine in the prostate capsules of men with symptomatic and asymptomatic BPH was similar. A correlation between alpha 1 adrenoceptor density and phenylephrine Emax was not observed, implying that either alpha 1 adrenoceptors are not localised exclusively to the prostate smooth muscle or that spare alpha 1 adrenoceptors exist. This study suggests that the neuropharmacological properties of the prostate capsule may play a significant role in the development of infravesical obstruction in the ageing male population.\r"

The need for immediate surgery is emphasised, in order to avoid erectile failure and curvature, which are typical complications of conservative treatment. Surgery consists of complete evacuation of haematoma, curettage and repair of the albuginea. If the fracture is associated with urethral disruption, the latter is also repaired.\r"

We have evaluated various techniques for cavernosometry: with and without intracavernous papaverine, with different dosages and modalities, with different modes of induction flow and at various intracavernous pressures. A standardised technique was tested and retested in 32 impotent men. If pharmacocavernosometry is accepted as the most reliable test and a maintenance flow less than 20 ml/min indicates optimal venous occlusion, plain cavernosometry gave 6% false positive and 16% false negative results. Pharmacocavernosometry was found to be highly reproducible with regard to maintenance flow for patients thought to have optimal venous occlusion and for those with supposed leakage. The induction flow was of no diagnostic value. After injection of papaverine the maintenance flow became a reproducible parameter for quantifying venous outflow and could be measured with an intracavernous pressure equivalent to systolic blood pressure to minimise cavernous arterial inflow and increase reproducibility.\r"

Poorly differentiated carcinomas and cancers of other types are very rare. The new grading system was found to be practical and a correlation between histological grade, clinical findings and prognosis was established. Patients with grade 1 tumours had an exceptionally favourable prognosis, with more than 80% being long-term survivors; for these patients, treatment with delayed side effects should be avoided and new forms of treatment should be explored.\r"

  ".W": "In 11 patients with long-term indwelling catheters the amount of catheter encrustation and urinary pH were measured and the urine regularly cultured over a prolonged period of time (median of 7 periods of 3 weeks). The mean urinary pH was related to the persistent presence of urease-producing micro-organisms (P. mirabilis) and urinary pH governed the precipitation of catheter encrustation. The critical pH appeared to be around 6.8. In patients with a mean urinary pH below this level the encrustation was minute (less than or equal to 2.9 mg phosphate). In patients with a mean urinary pH above 6.8 it was considerable but with a marked interindividual variation (35.5-138.7 mg phosphate). The composition of the encrustation was also strongly pH-related, with a much higher proportion present as magnesium ammonium phosphate in patients with a mean urinary pH above 6.8. The persistent presence of urease producers was not associated with a high pH or a more pronounced precipitation of phosphate in all patients. The amount of encrustation thus appears to depend not only on the presence of urease-producing micro-organisms but also on individual factors such as urinary composition.\r"

Seven ureters required a second injection and reflux was cured in 6 of these. The overall cure rate was therefore 80% after the second injection. There was one complication due to self-limiting ureteric obstruction following injection. The procedure is quick, easy to perform and effective. We have some reservations about the long-term efficiency and safety of subureteric Polytef injection in children.\r"

It has been reported most frequently in association with ureterosigmoidostomy, where clinical neurological symptoms have developed abruptly in association with markedly elevated plasma ammonia levels. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ureterosigmoidostomy patients might have subclinically elevated plasma ammonia levels, which would put them at risk of subsequently developing hyperammonaemic encephalopathy. Both urine and plasma ammonia levels were assayed in 10 asymptomatic paediatric urological patients with ureterosigmoidostomy. Ten paediatric colocystoplasty patients served as controls. Urine pH and urine ammonia levels were significantly higher in the ureterosigmoidostomy group. There was no significant difference in plasma ammonia levels between ureterosigmoidostomy and colocystoplasty patients. In none of the patients was the plasma ammonia level elevated, but 1 ureterosigmoidostomy patient had an exceedingly high urine ammonia level. It was concluded that an annual serum ammonia level in an asymptomatic ureterosigmoidostomy patient is probably not a valuable screen for subclinical hyperammonaemia.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the major risk factor associated with myocardial failure. An explanation for why a presumptive adaptation such as LVH would prove pathological has been elusive. Insights into the impairment in contractility of the hypertrophied myocardium have been sought in the biochemistry of cardiac myocyte contraction. Equally compelling is a consideration of abnormalities in myocardial structure that impair organ contractile function while preserving myocyte contractility. For example, in the LVH that accompanies hypertension, the extracellular space is frequently the site of an abnormal accumulation of fibrillar collagen. This reactive and progressive interstitial and perivascular fibrosis accounts for abnormal myocardial stiffness and ultimately ventricular dysfunction and is likely a result of cardiac fibroblast growth and enhanced collagen synthesis. The disproportionate involvement of this nonmyocyte cell, however, is not a uniform accompaniment to myocyte hypertrophy and LVH, suggesting that the growth of myocyte and nonmyocyte cells is independent of each other. This has now been demonstrated in in vivo studies of experimental hypertension in which the abnormal fibrous tissue response was found in the hypertensive, hypertrophied left ventricle as well as in the normotensive, nonhypertrophied right ventricle. These findings further suggest that a circulating substance that gained access to the common coronary circulation of the ventricles was involved. This hypothesis has been tested in various animal models in which plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone were varied. Based on morphometric and morphological findings, it can be concluded that arterial hypertension (i.e., an elevation in coronary perfusion pressure) together with elevated circulating aldosterone are associated with cardiac fibroblast involvement and the resultant heterogeneity in tissue structure. Nonmyocyte cells of the cardiac interstitium represent an important determinant of pathological LVH. The mechanisms that invoke short- (e.g., collagen metabolism) and long-term (e.g., mitosis) responses of cardiac fibroblasts require further investigation and integration of in vitro with in vivo studies. The stage is set, however, to prevent pathological LVH resulting from myocardial fibrosis as well as to reverse it.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Evaluation of gene expression in failing human heart has been limited by the availability of cardiac tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess gene expression in small quantities of failing and nonfailing human heart. PCR is a powerful new molecular biological tool that allows a small quantity of DNA to be amplified as much as 1 million-fold. Total RNA was extracted from 3-5 mg samples of human heart and reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA). With selected oligonucleotide primers, we used PCR to amplify cDNAs encoding atrial natriuretic peptide, beta-myosin heavy chain, phospholamban, and cytoskeletal beta-actin. To quantify the relative levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) in human heart, a known amount of a control RNA was present in the reverse transcription and PCR reactions. The amount of mRNA in the sample could therefore be assessed in relation to the amount of control product. The control RNA was transcribed from a synthetic DNA template containing primers complementary to those used to amplify the cDNAs of interest. Atrial natriuretic factor mRNA could not be detected in nonfailing human heart but was abundant in ventricular myocardium from failing human heart. In contrast, steady-state levels of phospholamban mRNA decreased, whereas levels of beta-myosin heavy-chain mRNA were unchanged with heart failure. CONCLUSIONS. Alterations in gene expression in the failing human heart appear to be selective. In addition, the present study suggests that PCR provides a rapid and economical way to quantify the expression of multiple genes of interest in endomyocardial biopsy specimens and may therefore be used to advance our understanding of heart muscle disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In patients with congestive heart failure, the chronotropic and inotropic responses to beta-adrenergic agonists are reduced. It is not known whether desensitization of peripheral beta-adrenoceptors accounts for impaired limb vasodilation in these patients. Accordingly, we studied 14 normal subjects and 13 age-matched patients with congestive heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS. To distinguish vasodilation mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and adenylate cyclase from that mediated by stimulation of guanylate cyclase, each subject received intrabrachial artery infusions of isoproterenol (1-100 ng/min) and sodium nitroprusside (0.3-10 micrograms/min), respectively. Forearm blood flow was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography. Maximal vasodilative potential, determined during reactive hyperemia, was reduced in the patients with congestive heart failure. The maximal forearm blood flow response to isoproterenol was comparable in patients with heart failure and in normal subjects (8.0 +/- 1.1 versus 9.2 +/- 1.2 ml/100 ml of tissue/min, respectively, p = NS). Furthermore, the dose-response relation to isoproterenol was similar in both groups. Likewise, the forearm vasodilative response to sodium nitroprusside was preserved in the heart failure group. Plasma concentration of norepinephrine was higher in the patients with heart failure (436 +/- 34 versus 201 +/- 74 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). When both groups were considered, there was no correlation between norepinephrine levels and the maximal forearm blood flow response to isoproterenol (r = 0.10, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor desensitization does not occur in the limb vessels of patients with congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The pathogenesis of sodium and water accumulation in chronic constrictive pericarditis is not well understood and may differ from that in patients with chronic congestive heart failure due to myocardial disease. This study was undertaken to investigate some of the mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using standard techniques, the hemodynamics, water and electrolyte spaces, renal function, and plasma concentrations of hormones were measured in 16 patients with untreated constrictive pericarditis and were measured again in eight patients after pericardiectomy. The average hemodynamic measurements were as follows: cardiac output, 1.98 l/min/m2; right atrial pressure, 22.9 mm Hg; pulmonary wedge pressure, 24.2 mm Hg; and mean pulmonary artery pressure 30.2 mm Hg. The systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances (36.3 +/- 2.5 and 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg.min.m2/l, respectively) were increased. Significant increases occurred in total body water (36%), extracellular volume (81%), plasma volume (53%), and exchangeable sodium (63%). The renal plasma flow was only moderately decreased (49%), and the glomerular filtration rate was normal. Significant increases also occurred in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (3.6 times normal), renin activity (7.2 time normal), aldosterone (3.4 times normal), cortisol (1.4 times normal), growth hormone (21.8 times normal), and atrial natriuretic peptide (5 times normal). The ratio of left atrial to aortic diameter measured by echocardiography was only minimally increased (1.29 +/- 0.04), indicating that in constrictive pericarditis the atria are prevented from expanding. The studies repeated after pericardiectomy in the eight patients showed that all measurements returned toward normal. CONCLUSIONS. The restricted distensibility of the atria, in constrictive pericarditis, limits the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor and, thus, reduces its natriuretic and diuretic effects. This results in retention of water and sodium greater than that occurring in patients with edema from myocardial disease. The arterial pressure is maintained more by the expansion of the blood volume than by an increase in the peripheral vascular resistance.\r"

In the Rotterdam QT Project, 6,693 consecutive patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were followed up for 2 years; of these, 245 patients died suddenly. A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and clinical data at the time of 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were collected for all patients who died suddenly and for a random sample of 467 patients from the study cohort. In all patients without an intraventricular conduction defect (176 patients who died suddenly and 390 patients from the sample), QT interval duration was measured in leads I, II, and III and corrected for heart rate with Bazett's formula (QTc). In patients without evidence of cardiac dysfunction (history of symptoms of pump failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%), QTc of more than 440 msec was associated with a 2.3 times higher risk for sudden death compared with a QTc of 440 msec or less (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.9). In contrast, in patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction, the relative risk of QTc prolongation was 1.0 (0.5, 1.9). Adjustment for age, gender, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and the use of drugs did not alter these relative risks. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that in patients without intraventricular conduction defects and cardiac dysfunction, QTc prolongation measured from the standard electrocardiogram is a risk factor for sudden death independent of age, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and drug use. In patients with cardiac dysfunction, QTc duration is not related to the risk for sudden death.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The Enalapril Postinfarction Exercise (EPIE) trial was designed to study the effect of enalapril treatment on peak and submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise performance over the course of 1 year in men after myocardial infarction with mild exercise intolerance. METHODS AND RESULTS. One hundred sixty men with a peak VO2 less than 25 ml/kg/min and without effort angina were randomized to receive enalapril 20 mg qd or placebo on a double-blind basis. The mean age was 60.3 +/- 7.6 years. All patients received concurrent beta-blocker therapy for secondary prophylaxis. Treatment began at 21 days (group 1, n = 100) or more than 6 months after infarction (group 2, n = 60). Patients underwent exercise with real-time gas-exchange analysis nine times over the course of 48 weeks. In group 1, improvement in exercise performance occurred during the course of the trial in both groups of patients receiving placebo or enalapril. The mean peak VO2 for the placebo-treated patients in group 1 increased from 18.3 +/- 3.4 ml/kg/min by 4.9% at 48 weeks (p less than 0.05). The corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 18.9 +/- 3.8 ml/kg/min with a 3.7% increase (p = 0.07). Total exercise time increased in the placebo-treated patients from 645 +/- 96 seconds by 7.3% (p less than 0.01). Corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 674 +/- 103 seconds with a 5.4% increase (p less than 0.01). In group 2, the mean peak VO2 at baseline for the placebo-treated patients of 20.3 +/- 3.8 ml/kg/min increased by 4.4% at 48 weeks (p = NS). The corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 19.2 +/- 3.6 ml/kg/min with a 2.6% increase (p = NS). Total exercise time increased in the placebo-treated patients from 677 +/- 114 seconds by 0.7% (p = NS). Corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 659 +/- 99 seconds with a 1.1% increase (p = NS). There were no significant differences between the placebo and enalapril subgroups at any time with regard to peak VO2, exercise duration, or the VO2 at the anaerobic threshold. CONCLUSIONS. This trial demonstrates that long-term converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril had no significant effect on the peak or submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise performance over the course of 1 year in men after myocardial infarction with only mildly reduced exercise capacity.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. To assess the likelihood of intermediate-term event-free survival (freedom from death, coronary artery bypass surgery, and myocardial infarction) in patients with multivessel coronary disease undergoing coronary angioplasty, 350 consecutive patients from four clinical sites were carefully evaluated and followed for 22 +/- 10 months. METHODS AND RESULTS. Eight clinical variables were evaluated at the clinical sites, and 23 angiographic variables describing the number, morphology, and topography of coronary stenoses were evaluated at a core angiographic laboratory. Most patients had Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III or IV angina (72%), two-vessel coronary disease (68%), and well-preserved left ventricular function (mean ejection fraction, 58 +/- 12%; range, 18-85%). Follow-up was complete in 99% of patients. At 2 years, event-free survival was 72%, overall survival was 96%, freedom from bypass surgery was 82%, and freedom from nonfatal myocardial infarction without surgery was 96%. Sequential Cox proportional hazards regression analyses allowing stepwise entry of variables prospectively coded as simple, as of intermediate complexity, or as complex found event-free survival to be independently predicted by low Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class, no diabetes, no proximal left anterior descending stenoses, and the sum of stenosis simplified risk-territory scores of 15 or less. In the absence of class IV angina and these risk factors, 2-year event-free survival was 87% and overall survival was 100%. In the presence of two or more of these risk factors, event-free survival was less than 50%. CONCLUSIONS. Recognition of risk factors for poor long-term outcome in this setting may improve clinical decision making and provide a framework on which to base meaningful subgroup analyses in randomized trials assessing the efficacy of coronary angioplasty.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of patients after percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) treatment of congenital pulmonary valve stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. This study represents a case series with duration (mean +/- SD) of follow-up of 4.6 +/- 1.9 years. Forty-six patients with a median age of 4.6 years (range, 3 months to 56 years) had BPV at one academic institution between June 1981 and December 1986. Mean peak systolic pressure gradients from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery were as follows: before BPV, 70 +/- 36 mm Hg; immediately after BPV, 23 +/- 14 mm Hg; at intermediate follow-up by cardiac catheterization or Doppler echocardiography at less than 2 years after BPV, 23 +/- 16 mm Hg (n = 33); and at long-term follow-up by Doppler at more than 2 years after BPV, 20 +/- 13 mm Hg (n = 42). BPV acutely reduced the gradient to less than 36 mm Hg for 41 of 46 (89%) patients. Available gradients at long-term follow-up were less than 36 mm Hg for 36 of 42 (86%) patients without additional procedures. A patient age of less than 2 years at the initial BPV was a significant risk factor for gradients over 36 mm Hg at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. BPV provides long-term relief of pulmonary valvular obstruction in the majority of patients. Close follow-up of patients who require BPV at less than 2 years of age is warranted.\r"

Stents were mounted over balloons and placed by standard catheterization techniques. Twenty-three patients had branch pulmonary artery stenosis. Thirty-six stents were placed successfully and had reduced pressure gradients from 50.6 +/- 24 to 15.9 +/- 13.4 mm Hg. Five patients had stents placed after atrial surgery: three in obstructed Fontan repairs, one at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction after sinus venous defect repair, and one at the site of a Glenn shunt. Atrial stents reduced pressure gradients from 9.8 +/- 8.2 to 2.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. One patient had a stent placed in the descending aorta after coarctation dilation, and the pressure gradient was reduced from 50 to 25 mm Hg. One patient had pulmonary vein dilation with stent placement. Two stents migrated at the time of placement; one required surgical removal, and one was anchored in place by balloon dilation. One patient died within 24 hours of catheterization because of thrombus obstruction of the Fontan repair. Nine patients have undergone recatheterization. All stented vessels have remained at the same caliber as at original stent placement. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that balloon expandable stents are useful in selected postoperative stenoses in congenital heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genesis of the Austin Flint murmur using Doppler and echocardiographic imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS. A total of 51 patients having significant aortic insufficiency and an anatomically normal mitral valve were evaluated. They were divided into two groups; 30 patients had an audible Austin Flint murmur (AFM+) and 21 did not (AFM-). All patients had a complete M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic examination to characterize left ventricular size and function, motion of the mitral valve, transmitral flow velocities, direction of the aortic insufficiency jet, and severity of aortic insufficiency. There was no significant difference in severity of aortic insufficiency between groups. There was, however, a significant difference in direction of the insufficiency jet. In the AFM+ group compared with the AFM- group, for the parasternal long-axis view 24 (80%) versus eight (38%) had their insufficiency jet directed at the mitral valve, for the apical five-chamber view the values were 25 (83%) versus five (24%), and for the apical long-axis view the values were 27 (90%) versus five (24%); for all comparisons p less than 0.01. There was also a greater frequency of localized anterior mitral leaflet distortion by two-dimensional echocardiography (AFM+:23 [77%] versus AFM-:five [24%]; p less than 0.001) and a greater frequency of Doppler striations overlying the aortic insufficiency jet (AFM+:25 [83%] versus AFM-:seven [33%]; p less than 0.001). Regarding transmitral flow velocities, there was no significant difference in filling patterns or absolute velocities during early or late diastole between groups. There was no gradient by Doppler analysis or by hemodynamics (n = 26) across the mitral valve in either group. There also was no difference in the frequency of preclosure of the mitral valve (AFM+:two versus AFM-:three). Systolic function was similar in both groups, but the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was significantly greater in the AFM+ group (6.8 +/- 0.8 cm) than in the AFM- group (6.2 +/- 0.7 cm, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study suggest that the primary factor responsible for the Austin Flint murmur is the presence of an aortic insufficiency jet directed at the anterior mitral leaflet. This, combined with the biphasic pattern of transmitral flow, distorts the shape of the anterior mitral leaflet as it opens and closes during diastole, making it shudder. The leaflet's shuddering sets up vibrations and shock waves that distort the aortic insufficiency jet, causing the observed Doppler striations and probably the sound of the murmur. There is no evidence from this study to support prior theories that have proposed functional mitral stenosis or diastolic mitral regurgitation as the source of the murmur.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether cinemagnetic resonance imaging can provide information regarding the proximal acceleration flow region in patients with aortic regurgitation and to analyze the relation between the area of the proximal acceleration flow delineated by cinemagnetic resonance imaging and the severity of aortic regurgitation delineated by angiography. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty-eight consecutive patients who underwent aortography were examined by cinemagnetic resonance imaging. The region of proximal flow acceleration was identified as a semicircular-shaped signal void in the aorta during diastole. Cinemagnetic resonance imaging detected the proximal acceleration flow region in 26 of the 30 patients who were proved to have this lesion (sensitivity, 87%). In eight patients without aortic regurgitation according to aortography, no proximal acceleration flow region was detected (specificity, 100%). The area of the acceleration flow signal void from the long-axis view was well correlated with angiographic degree of aortic regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS. Cinemagnetic resonance imaging is useful in detecting the proximal acceleration flow region and permits noninvasive assessment of the severity of aortic regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Plasmin is capable of degrading extracellular matrix components such as collagen in vitro. To evaluate the significance of this for in vivo conditions, we set out to study the effect of streptokinase, which acts by converting plasminogen to plasmin, on the serum concentrations of the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) and the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP). METHODS AND RESULTS. Twenty-three patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were included in the study; 17 of them received thrombolytic therapy, and six were treated conservatively. PIIINP and PICP were assayed with radioimmunoassays. Kinetics of creatine kinase-MB release were determined to differentiate reperfusers from nonreperfusers. Composite curves of creatine kinase-MB release were constructed for different patient subgroups. During streptokinase infusion the serum concentrations of PIIINP increased rapidly, with a maximum mean increase of 50% (from 2.2 +/- 0.2 to 3.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms/l) in 45 minutes. A similar increase was also observed in two patients who received thrombolytic therapy but did not subsequently develop any myocardial infarction determined on the basis of enzyme release. The relative increase in PIIINP during streptokinase treatment was higher in those acute myocardial infarction patients with probable reperfusion than those with nonprobable reperfusion. Corresponding changes in PIIINP were not seen in the control group. Two days later there was a second increase in serum PIIINP for both patient groups. This change coincided with a similar increase in PICP. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that streptokinase, probably by activation of plasminogen to plasmin, stimulates the breakdown of type III collagen during thrombolytic therapy. This phenomenon may decrease the risk of rethrombosis of the affected artery if the exposed collagen is responsible for thrombosis formation, but it could also be involved in the development of hemorrhagic complications during thrombolytic therapy. The second increase in PIIINP levels probably indicates type III collagen synthesis of the infarcted area. This investigation represents a pilot study, and more studies on the effects of various thrombolytic agents on interstitial collagen metabolism are obviously needed.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Ultrasonic angioplasty was recently shown to ablate thrombi and atherosclerotic plaques in vitro and to recanalize occluded arteries in experimental animal models. The goal of the present study was to examine the clinical feasibility of ultrasonic angioplasty. METHODS AND RESULTS. Intraoperative ultrasonic angioplasty was performed in vivo on totally occluded peripheral arteries (n = 7). The ultrasonic angioplasty device consists of a 1.6-mm diameter flexible wire attached to a piezoelectric crystal generating ultrasound at 20 kHz. The controls, totally occluded human atherosclerotic femoral arterial segments (n = 6), were crossed mechanically with the ultrasound wire ex vivo but without application of ultrasonic energy. Ultrasonic angioplasty achieved successful recanalization without perforation in all vessels. Angiograms of the treated arteries showed an average lumen patency of 82.5%. Histological examination of the recanalized arteries revealed that the recanalization had taken place through intima diffusely involved with complicated plaque. The treated arteries, compared with the controls, had greater area of recanalized lumen (5.9 +/- 1.8 versus 1.7 +/- 0.4 mm2, p less than 0.05) and more flow (49.3 +/- 16.0 versus 11.8 +/- 4.9 ml/min, p less than 0.03). The damage in treated and control arteries was similar. Size-distribution analysis of the plaque debris from the treated arteries showed that 41 +/- 5% of the debris was 0.2-8 microns, 48 +/- 8% was 8-30 microns, and the remainder was 30-100 microns. In the mechanically crossed arteries, there was a shift in the distribution to larger size debris with 47 +/- 1% greater than 100 microns (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Ultrasonic angioplasty may be a useful clinical method for recanalization of total occlusions in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Ultrasonic energy appears to cause controlled injury to the atherosclerotic intima by selectively disrupting the ultrasound-sensitive occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Rate-dependent conduction slowing by class I antiarrhythmic agents has clinically important consequences. Class I drugs are known to produce use-dependent sodium channel blockade. If rate-dependent conduction slowing by class I agents is due to sodium channel blocking actions, the kinetics of conduction slowing should be similar to those of depression of sodium current indexes in vitro. The purpose of the present investigation was to study the onset time course of ventricular conduction slowing caused by a variety of class I agents in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS. Twenty-seven patients undergoing electrophysiological evaluation for antiarrhythmic therapy were studied. Changes in QRS duration at initiation of ventricular pacing at cycle lengths of 400 and 500 msec were used to evaluate the kinetics of drug action. Mean time constants for each drug were similar to values for Vmax depression reported in vitro studies: flecainide, 24.9 +/- 11.6 beats in eight patients (versus 34.5 beats reported for Vmax block); propafenone, 17.8 +/- 6.9 beats in five patients (versus 8.4-20.8 beats); quinidine, 7.0 +/- 2.4 beats in six patients (versus 5.6-6.2 beats); and amiodarone, 3.6 +/- 2.0 beats for eight patients (versus 3.0 beats). Time constants were significantly different among the various drugs tested (p = 0.0002 at a cycle length of 400 msec; p = 0.002 at 500 msec), and there was a strong correlation (r = 0.89, p less than 0.0001) between values obtained at a cycle length of 400 msec and those at a cycle length of 500 msec. No rate-dependent changes in QRS duration were seen at onset of ventricular pacing among eight age- and disease-matched control patients not taking class I antiarrhythmic drugs, including three patients subsequently showing such changes during type I antiarrhythmic drug therapy. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that class I agents produce use-dependent QRS prolongation in humans with characteristic kinetics for each agent that are similar to the kinetics of Vmax depression in vitro. These results suggest that rate-dependent ventricular conduction slowing by antiarrhythmic drugs in humans is due to use-dependent sodium channel blockade.\r"

A strong correlation between rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease and HLA-DRw53 (72.9% in the disease group versus 39% in the control group: p = 0.00061, relative risk, 4.2; etiologic fraction, 0.43) was found. We also found an increase in the frequency of HLA-DR7 (57.5% in the disease group versus 26.3% in control group: p = 0.00715; relative risk, 3.8; etiologic fraction, 0.56).

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Cardiac tamponade after cardiac surgical procedures is often associated with hemodynamically significant localized pericardial effusions. The localized collection of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period and the atypical presentation of cardiac tamponade limit the use of conventional clinical and echocardiographic signs usually seen with a circumferential pericardial effusion. Observation of left ventricular diastolic collapse in the echocardiogram of a patient with postoperative regional cardiac tamponade prompted us to explore the frequency of this sign in regional cardiac tamponade. METHODS AND RESULTS. We retrospectively analyzed the echocardiograms of 18 patients with postoperative cardiac tamponade for the following echocardiographic findings: right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, left atrial collapse, and left ventricular diastolic collapse. Three of the 18 patients had circumferential pericardial effusion, and 15 had loculated pericardial effusion; in 10, the effusion was predominantly posterior, and in the other five, it extended laterally or inferiorly. The conventional echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade such as right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, and left atrial collapse were present in only 3, 1, and 3 of these 15 patients, respectively, but all exhibited left ventricular diastolic collapse. Increasing pressure within the compartment of a loculated pericardial effusion reaching the limit of pericardial distensibility and consequent transient reversal of transmural left ventricular pressure during diastole are most likely the basis for diastolic collapse of the thick-walled ventricle in a setting of regional cardiac tamponade. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that left ventricular diastolic collapse is a frequent sign of regional cardiac tamponade and could be a useful marker of tamponade in postoperative patients.\r"

  ".U": "91249442\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We studied the effects of low density lipoprotein (LDL) on endothelium function. METHODS AND RESULTS. Porcine epicardial and intramyocardial coronary arteries suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording were exposed to LDL for 2 hours and were then washed. In epicardial coronary arteries, oxidized LDL (30-300 micrograms/ml) but not native LDL or lysolecithin inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxations to serotonin, thrombin, and aggregating platelets (5,000-75,000/microliter). Endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin and A23187 and endothelium-independent relaxations to SIN-1 were unaffected by oxidized LDL. In intramyocardial coronary arteries, oxidized LDL had no appreciable effect on relaxations to serotonin. The effect of oxidized LDL on the response to serotonin in epicardial coronary arteries was completely prevented by dextran sulfate (10 micrograms/ml). The inhibitory effect of oxidized LDL persisted in the presence of pertussis toxin. Similar to the lipoproteins, L-NG-monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA) reduced relaxations to serotonin but not to bradykinin in epicardial coronary arteries. In the presence of L-NMMA, oxidized LDL further reduced the response to serotonin. In arteries in which relaxations to serotonin were inhibited by oxidized LDL, L-arginine but not D-arginine induced a full relaxation. Pretreatment with L-arginine potentiated relaxations to serotonin in arteries exposed to oxidized LDL. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, oxidized LDL activates the scavenger receptor on endothelial cells and inhibits the receptor-operated nitric oxide formation in epicardial but not in intramyocardial coronary arteries. The mechanism is not related to dysfunction of a Gi protein but is related to a reduced intracellular availability of L-arginine. The reduced nitric oxide formation at sites of early atherosclerotic lesions may favor platelet aggregation and vasospasm, both of which are known clinical events in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

The effects of carteolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, were compared with those of metoprolol in a murine model of viral myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy caused by encephalomyocarditis virus. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the acute experiment, BALB/c and DBA/2 mice were inoculated with encephalomyocarditis virus. BALB/c mice were then given carteolol at 1 (n = 10), 10 (n = 10), 30 (n = 11), or 100 mg/kg (n = 9) daily, and DBA/2 mice were given carteolol at 1 (n = 9) or 10 mg/kg (n = 9) daily starting the day of inoculation. Controls were given distilled water (n = 23 for BALB/c mice and n = 8 for DBA/2 mice). BALB/c mice were killed on day 7, and DBA/2 mice were killed on day 14. In the subacute experiment, DBA/2 mice were inoculated with the virus and then given carteolol at 1 (n = 12) or 10 mg/kg (n = 16), or distilled water (n = 27) daily, starting on day 14. Mice were killed on day 28. Virus replication, murine survival, heart weight to body weight ratio, and histopathological findings were similar in each group in the acute and subacute experiments. In the chronic experiment, DBA/2 mice were inoculated with the virus and were then given carteolol at 1 (n = 13) or 10 mg/kg (n = 9), metoprolol at 30 mg/kg (n = 9), or distilled water (n = 31) daily, starting on day 14. Mice were killed on day 104. Heart weight to body weight ratio and histopathological scores were significantly lower in mice given carteolol than in the infected control group. Furthermore, left ventricular cavity dimension, left ventricular wall thickness, and myocardial fiber diameter of the left ventricle were significantly reduced in mice given carteolol compared with the control group. Metoprolol did not cause any significant changes compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that carteolol prevents the development of myocardial lesions similar to those in dilated cardiomyopathy after myocarditis in the chronic stage.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Transient reversible myocardial dysfunction has been documented after episodes of exercise-induced ischemia. This study was undertaken to determine whether the duration or intensity of exercise affects the severity of postischemic dysfunction in this setting. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ten dogs were instrumented with ultrasonic microcrystals for measurement of wall thickening, with circumflex coronary artery flow probes, and with hydraulic occluders. Dogs performed low-intensity exercise, which was sufficient to increase coronary perfusion 50% above control, and high-intensity exercise, which was sufficient to double coronary blood flow. To investigate the effects of exercise intensity on postischemic dysfunction, we had dogs perform high-intensity exercise for 5 minutes in the presence of a stenosis. On the alternate day, dogs performed low-intensity exercise for 10 minutes in the presence of a stenosis. These two protocols provide equivalent coronary flow debts. Mean transmural blood flow during high-intensity exercise without stenosis (2.61 +/- 0.54 ml/min/g) was significantly higher than that during low-intensity exercise (1.74 +/- 0.61 ml/min/g, p less than 0.002). During high-intensity exercise with coronary artery stenosis, subendocardial blood flow was significantly lower than that during low-intensity exercise with stenosis (0.64 +/- 0.40 versus 1.08 +/- 0.28 ml/min/g, p less than 0.02). This difference in subendocardial perfusion was associated with greater degrees of regional dysfunction during exercise (circumflex wall thickening was 44 +/- 23% of control for high-intensity exercise versus 60 +/- 18% of control for low-intensity exercise, p less than 0.01). In addition, from 10 to 30 minutes after exercise, wall thickening in myocardium perfused by the circumflex coronary artery remained significantly lower after high-intensity exercise than that after low-intensity exercise. To assess the effects of exercise duration on the severity of postischemic dysfunction, we had dogs perform low-intensity exercise in the presence of a coronary stenosis for 10 minutes and low-intensity exercise for only 5 minutes on alternate days. Systolic wall thickening was significantly lower after low-intensity exercise for 10 minutes than after low-intensity exercise for 5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. High-intensity exercise results in greater degrees of subendocardial hypoperfusion and greater degrees of regional dysfunction both during and after exercise-induced ischemia than does low-intensity exercise. Second, exercise duration also exerts an effect on the severity of postischemic dysfunction, although the magnitude of this effect is less important than the effect of exercise intensity.\r"

Systemic vasodilation did not occur. Pulmonary vasodilation by NO inhalation was produced during infusion of U46619 for periods of 1 hour without observing evidence of short-term tolerance. Pulmonary hypertension resumed within 3-6 minutes of ceasing NO inhalation. In the normal lamb, the pulmonary vascular resistance, systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output, left atrial and central venous pressures were unaltered by NO inhalation. CONCLUSION.

Bradykinin has been demonstrated to be an endothelium-dependent vasodilator in the cerebral circulation of the mouse, but the actions of bradykinin on regional tissue perfusion in the canine coronary circulation have not been studied. METHODS AND RESULTS. The mechanism of coronary vasodilation by bradykinin was studied in open-chest, anesthetized dogs. The role of cyclooxygenase stimulation, bradykinin B2 receptor activation, and endothelium-derived relaxing factor in bradykinin-mediated vasodilation was studied in separate groups of dogs. Bradykinin was infused intracoronarily so as to avoid changes in systemic hemodynamics capable of altering the regional distribution of coronary blood flow (radioactive microspheres). Bradykinin produced a preferential increase in subendocardial blood flow. Pretreatment with indomethacin had no effect on bradykinin-mediated increases in total left ventricular flow or the transmural distribution of coronary blood flow. Blockade of bradykinin B2 receptors with the competitive antagonist [Thi5,8, D-Phe7]-bradykinin attenuated both the increase in total flow and redistribution of perfusion to the subendocardium produced by bradykinin. Inhibition of endothelium-derived relaxing factor with quinacrine, occlusion/reperfusion, or NG-monomethyl L-arginine attenuated the total increase in left ventricular flow and blocked the redistribution of flow to the subendocardium produced by bradykinin. CONCLUSIONS. The present results demonstrate that intracoronary infusion of bradykinin produces a preferential increase in blood flow to the subendocardium via stimulation of B2 receptors and the release of an endothelium-dependent relaxing factor that may be nitric oxide.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. To better understand the refractory period extension (RPE) produced by transcardiac shocks and its possible role in defibrillation, we measured RPE under various experimental conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using ventricular pacing in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, we characterized RPE in relation to the anatomic site of pacing, the local voltage gradient (LVG) produced by the shocks at the pacing site, and the pacing rate and pacing current used to make the measurements. We also determined if RPE persisted into the next refractory period after the shock and measured RPE at the end of 30-second episodes of acute ischemia to the pacing site, which were caused by occluding the left anterior descending artery. Each anatomic site tested showed RPE, which increased sharply with increasing LVG at lower levels but less sharply at higher LVG. The RPE versus LVG was approximated with an exponential curve that had an exponential constant of about 5-6 V/cm. At faster pacing rates, RPE occurred earlier in the refractory period but was unchanged when expressed as a percent increase of refractory period. RPE did not vary with the pacing current and was present only in the refractory period during which the shock was delivered. The RPE was not significantly altered by acute ischemia. These results show that transcardiac shocks selectively extend the refractory period of tissue proportional to the LVG and the timing of the shock in the refractory period. They are consistent with the concept that RPE prevents depolarization from tissue directly excited by a shock from propagating to tissue that was refractory to that same shock. CONCLUSIONS. The insensitivity of RPE to short ischemic episodes and the presence of RPE at increased activation rates suggest that RPE might exist under conditions of fibrillation and be a major determinant of the success or failure of defibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. To define the arrhythmogenic effects of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the intact heart, we carried out a detailed electrophysiological assessment in our previously validated feline aortic-banding model and then tested the effects of agents that blocked either the slow inward calcium or voltage-dependent potassium channel. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured intraventricular and interventricular conduction times, excitability thresholds, ventricular effective refractory periods, and monophasic action potential duration at several sites in cats with LVH as well as in concurrent control (sham-operated) cats. In addition, we assessed vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia using direct measurement of ventricular fibrillation (VF) thresholds and by standard techniques of programmed stimulation. Despite finding no difference between LVH and sham-operated cats in mean values for several electrophysiological parameters, the former group was significantly more vulnerable to VF, with more spontaneous VF and lower VF thresholds. Compared with the sham controls, LVH cats also had a greater dispersion of effective refractory period (35 +/- 11 versus 12 +/- 4 msec, p less than 0.01) and monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (69 +/- 25 versus 39 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.02). Verapamil had no significant effect on these electrophysiological parameters, nor did it affect VF threshold. However, risotilide, an inhibitor of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, narrowed dispersion of the effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration concomitant with a marked reduction in ventricular vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS. LVH has a pronounced effect on dispersion of refractoriness and repolarization and renders the ventricle more vulnerable to fibrillation. Blockade of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, but not the slow inward calcium channel, narrows the dispersion of recovery of excitability and protects against VF.\r"

Recent advances in adrenergic pharmacology have made possible the identification of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes using the specific blockers chloroethylclonidine and WB 4101. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, we used these two blockers to determine the mechanisms responsible for automatic rhythms occurring during simulated ischemia and reperfusion of isolated canine Purkinje fibers. Experiments were done in the presence of propranolol to minimize beta-adrenergic contributions to the rhythms studied. In the control situation, all fibers showed membrane potentials greater than -90 mV and normal automatic rhythms. During simulated ischemia, membrane potential depolarized to the -60 mV range. Abnormal automaticity was seen in 20% of fibers not treated with phenylephrine and in 50% of those superfused with 1 x 10(-7) M phenylephrine. The incidence of abnormal automaticity was reduced to 0% by WB 4101 (which blocks phosphoinositide metabolic effects of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the heart) and was increased to 90% by chloroethylclonidine (which blocks Na-K pump-stimulating effects of alpha-agonists). Moreover, the ischemic fibers were significantly more hyperpolarized during superfusion with WB 4101 than with chloroethylclonidine. Triggered activity induced by delayed or early after depolarizations was not seen in any experiment. CONCLUSIONS. Automatic arrhythmias induced by alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation during simulated ischemia may be attributed to a specific alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype that is blocked by WB 4101. These results have important implications with respect to the induction of arrhythmias in the setting of ischemia and the means for their prevention or treatment.\r"

Atherosclerosis has been associated with loss of artery wall distensibility in human cadavers and in experimental animal models, giving it the lay term \"hardening of the arteries.\" METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the effect of calcification on arterial distensibility, balloon pressure and volume were recorded during dilation of calcified aortas in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits in vivo. Calcification was induced by dietary supplements of cholesterol, vitamin D2, and calcium. Balloon pressure, volume, and time signals were acquired at high frequency with controls for temperature and balloon inflation rate. Resistance to balloon dilation was minimal in control rabbit aortas (delta Vmax = 5.0 +/- 3.5 microliters) and in excised nonatherosclerotic human coronary arteries, and it was small in aortas from cholesterol-fed rabbits (12.3 +/- 8 microliters), even when lipid levels were markedly elevated by a high cholesterol diet (611 +/- 347 mg/dl). With dietary cholesterol, vitamin D2, and calcium supplements, WHHL rabbits developed mild hypercalcemia (15 +/- 1.9 mg/dl), hypercholesterolemia (1,100 +/- 633 mg/dl), moderate-to-marked aortic calcification, and high resistance to balloon dilation (38 +/- 27) comparable to that seen in angioplasty patients. CONCLUSIONS. It is concluded that experimentally induced calcification decreases the distensibility of the rabbit aorta in vivo and that it yields to balloon dilation by plastic deformation closely resembling that seen in balloon angioplasty of human coronary arteries. These findings suggest that calcification contributes to arterial \"hardening\" associated with atherosclerosis.\r"

Recent advances in fetal echocardiography have necessitated further study on fetal in situ cardiovascular morphology of truncus arteriosus and the effects of truncal valve insufficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 55 fetal rats with truncus arteriosus among 300 fetuses from 40 virgin females treated with 200 mg fertilysin on the 10th day of pregnancy. After rapid whole-body freezing on the 21st day, the fetuses were studied by means of serial cross-sectional photographs of the frozen thorax. Thirty-five fetuses with a normal heart treated with fertilysin served as controls. Truncus arteriosus was characterized by a large ventricular septal defect, a solitary artery (truncus arteriosus) overriding the ventricular septum, the right and left pulmonary arteries originating from the truncus arteriosus with or without a common trunk (main pulmonary artery), and absent ductus arteriosus. Fetuses with truncal valve insufficiency had thick truncal valves, a large truncus arteriosus, and large ventricles. The subgroup of 12 fetuses with a large truncus (truncal diameter greater than 160% of the ascending aorta diameter in the controls) showed significantly greater values for right ventricular volume (200% of control) and mass (120% of control), left ventricular volume (170% of control) and mass (110% of control), right (120% of control) and left (110% of control) atrial volume, and pericardial fluid (140% of control) than the controls. These changes were less prominent and ventricular volumes were not increased in the remaining subgroup with a truncal diameter of 160% or less of aorta diameter in the controls. CONCLUSIONS. In fetal truncus arteriosus, truncal valve insufficiency was associated with increased ventricular volume load and incomplete cardiac compensation in rats.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The complete continuous-wave Doppler mitral regurgitant velocity curve should allow reconstruction of the ventriculoatrial (VA) pressure gradient from mitral valve closure to opening, including left ventricular (LV) isovolumic contraction, ejection, and isovolumic relaxation. Assuming that the left atrial pressure fluctuation is relatively minor in comparison with the corresponding LV pressure changes during systole, the first derivative of the Doppler-derived VA pressure gradient curve (Doppler dP/dt) might be used to estimate the LV dP/dt curve, previously measurable only at catheterization (catheter dP/dt). METHODS AND RESULTS. This hypothesis was examined in an in vivo mitral regurgitant model during 30 hemodynamic stages in eight dogs. Contractility and relaxation were altered by inotropic stimulation and hypothermia. The Doppler mitral regurgitant velocity spectrum was recorded along with simultaneously acquired micromanometer LV and left atrial pressures. The regurgitant velocity profiles were digitized and converted to VA pressure gradient curves using the simplified Bernoulli equation. The instantaneous dP/dt of the VA pressure gradient curve was then derived. The instantaneous Doppler-derived VA pressure gradients, instantaneous Doppler dP/dt, dP/dtmax, and -dP/dtmax were compared with corresponding catheter measurements. This method of estimating dP/dtmax from the instantaneous dP/dt curve was also compared with a previously proposed Doppler method of estimating dP/dtmax using the Doppler-derived mean rate of LV pressure rise over the time period between velocities of 1 and 3 m/sec on the ascending slope of the Doppler velocity spectrum. Both instantaneous Doppler-derived VA pressure gradients (r = 0.95, p less than 0.0001) and Doppler dP/dt (r = 0.92, p less than 0.0001) correlated well with corresponding measurements by catheter during systolic contraction and isovolumic relaxation (pooled data). The Doppler dP/dtmax (1,266 +/- 701 mm Hg/sec) also correlated well (r = 0.94) with the catheter dP/dtmax (1,200 +/- 573 mm Hg/sec). There was no difference between the two methods for measurement of dP/dtmax (p = NS). Although Doppler -dP/dtmax was slightly lower than the catheter measurement (961 +/- 511 versus 1,057 +/- 540 mm Hg/sec, p less than 0.01), the correlation between measurements by Doppler and catheter was excellent (r = 0.93, p less than 0.0001). The alternative method of mean isovolumic pressure rise (896 +/- 465 mm Hg/sec) underestimated the catheter dP/dtmax (1,200 +/- 573 mm Hg/sec) significantly (on average, 25%; p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The present study demonstrated an accurate and reliable noninvasive Doppler method for estimating instantaneous LV dP/dt, dP/dtmax, and -dP/dtmax.\r"

Catheter ablation of the AV junction is considered the procedure of choice for management of patients without bypass tracts with drug-resistant supraventricular arrhythmias. Catheter techniques have been used with increasing frequency in attempts to ablate accessory AV tracts. These techniques currently appear to be less effective than surgical techniques but involve less morbidity and expense. In some centers, accessory pathway ablation using catheter techniques is the procedure of first choice in selected patients with drug-refractory tachycardia mediated by an accessory pathway. Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia should be reserved for patients with mappable ventricular tachycardia who are not candidates for cardiac electrosurgery or insertion of an automatic defibrillator. The development of more flexible catheters and more manageable energy delivery systems holds promise for more effective catheter techniques.\r"

Based on experimental findings, we present and discuss a pathological classification of vascular injury or damage and its role in the pathogenesis of various vascular diseases. In addition, these animal models have provided insights into the roles of platelets and lipid metabolism in the evolution and progression of atherosclerosis and have suggested potential therapeutic applications. Thus, based on studies in the pig models, antiplatelet agents have been shown for the first time to have a beneficial effect in preventing the formation and progression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in humans. Similarly, our findings in high density lipoprotein plasma fractions regarding inhibition and even reversal of the process of atherosclerosis in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model have added new insights to an explosive field of lipoprotein research and provided new avenues of therapeutic strategies. our in vivo and ex vivo pig models of an extracorporeal perfusion chamber mimicking the various coronary conditions have aided in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the acute coronary syndromes and intensified our search for the ideal antithrombotic regimen in these high-risk patients. Finally, a carotid pig model of balloon angioplasty, a dog model of saphenous vein grafting, and a pig model of heart transplantation not only have provided insights into the pathophysiological process of accelerated atherosclerosis but also are allowing development of new antithrombotic and antiproliferative approaches for the prevention of these accelerated vascular diseases. In summary, we are entering an exciting era in vascular research. Significant advances in our understanding of vascular injury or damage as well as the interactions of blood cells and lipids with the vascular wall have allowed us to formulate new experimental strategies with subsequent clinical application in the prevention and progression of these vascular diseases.\r"

The canine models consist of a whole blood clot produced in the left anterior descending coronary artery (ER thrombus) or a 1-cm everted (inside-out) segment graft in the circumflex coronary artery that predisposes to occlusion with PR material (PR thrombus). The rabbit models consist of a femoral arterial whole blood clot (ER thrombus) or a femoral arterial eversion graft (PR thrombus). The whole blood clot models are sensitive to recanalization with rt-PA but are consistently associated with reocclusion, notwithstanding the concomitant use of heparin and/or aspirin. Clot lysis is accelerated and reocclusion is prevented by the administration of F(ab')2 fragments of a monoclonal antibody 7E3 directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor; of Argatroban, a synthetic thrombin inhibitor; or of kistrin, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-blocking polypeptide from the Malayan pit viper venom. The PR thrombus models are very resistant to recanalization with rt-PA, but this resistance can be overcome by the concomitant use of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-blocking antibody. Thus, selective platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are more effective than aspirin, heparin, or both in accelerating arterial thrombolysis with rt-PA; in preventing reocclusion after clot lysis; and in overcoming the resistance of PR thrombus to dispersion with rt-PA. These experimental animal models may be useful in the development of improved thrombolytic strategies using plasminogen activators in conjunction with specifically targeted antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary artery bypass grafts, angioplasty, and thrombolysis are beneficial procedures for patients with coronary artery disease. However, these procedures can fail by mechanisms related to interactions between platelets and the damaged arterial wall. An experimental model for studying some of the mechanisms of platelet interaction with endothelial- and medial-damaged stenosed arteries is described. Dogs or pigs are anesthetized, and the chest opened. The heart is exposed, the circumflex or left anterior descending coronary artery is dissected out, and an EMF or Doppler flow probe is placed on it. Distal to the flow probe, the artery is clamped with a vascular clamp to produce endothelial and/or medial injury. Then, an encircling plastic cylinder is placed around the outside of the injured artery, producing a \"critical stenosis.\" Acute platelet thrombus formation begins to occur in the stenosed lumen, gradually increasing the amount of stenosis. This causes the coronary flow to decline and reach zero flow when the artery is completely occluded. Then, the thrombus is embolized into the distal circulation, and flow is restored to normal levels. This occurs repeatedly causing cyclic flow reductions (CFRs). These CFRs can be made larger and to occur more frequently by increasing in vivo platelet activity, by raising the plasma catecholamine levels, or by increasing the collagen exposed in the stenosed lumen by increased medial damage. If an effective dose of an antiplatelet agent is given, the CFRs will be decreased in size and frequency or abolished entirely. Aspirin and other agents abolish the CFRs in this model; however, CFRs can be renewed by infusions of catecholamines or platelet activating factor. Thus, the model may be useful for studying mechanisms that enhance or inhibit arterial thrombosis in stenosed arteries with endothelial and medial injury.\r"

Two methods of arterial injury have been used to determine the thrombotic response of flowing blood in vivo. The first involves balloon catheter injury. After superficial denudation of endothelium from coronary intima, platelets adhere to the subendothelium in a monolayer. Similar numbers of adherent platelets are found in both phenotypes, but platelets in vWD pigs have impaired pseudopod formation and are less well spread morphological indexes of limited platelet activation. Deeper injury, which involves the media, produces nonocclusive platelet-fibrin microthrombi. The second injury method involves pinching the artery at a site of superimposed stenosis, a procedure that almost always exposes media. This procedure induces platelet-fibrin microthrombi in normal and vWD pigs, but only normal pigs develop occlusive thrombosis. Both methods of arterial injury have also been performed in normal and vWD pigs with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis promotes platelet spread in vWD pigs but does not abolish the protection from stenosis and injury-induced occlusive thrombosis. In addition, neutralization of vWF activity in normal pigs by a monoclonal antibody prevents the induction of occlusive thrombosis by the stenosis and pinch-injury procedure. This monoclonal antibody also causes performed platelet aggregates to break up. These experimental models of inducing arterial thrombosis have been used in normal and vWD pigs to demonstrate interactions between normal and atherosclerotic vessel wall constituents, circulating platelets and vWF that are fundamental in the process of arterial thrombosis.\r"

In the rat model, infusion of solvent for 60 minutes was associated with mean +/- SEM lysis within 90 minutes of 13 +/- 3% (n = 8) by external counting and 26 +/- 4% (n = 8) by radioisotope recovery. Intravenous infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) over 60 minutes caused dose-dependent progressive clot lysis; with 0.5 mg/kg, producing a plasma level of 0.14 +/- 0.04 microgram/ml, lysis was 64 +/- 9% (n = 4) by external gamma counting and 78 +/- 4% (n = 4) by residual isotope in the vein segment and was not associated with significant fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin breakdown. In the hamster model, infusion of solvent for 60 minutes was associated with lysis within 90 minutes of 19 +/- 4% (n = 11) by external gamma counting and 31 +/- 3% (n = 14) by residual radioisotope. Intravenous rt-PA during 60 minutes resulted in dose-dependent progressive thrombolysis; with 0.5 mg/kg, producing a plasma level of 0.14 +/- 0.01 micrograms/ml, lysis was 50 +/- 4% (n = 4) by external gamma counting and 78 +/- 5% (n = 4) by residual radioactivity, without an extensive decrease in fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin. Parallel experiments in the rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model with a rabbit blood clot with intravenous infusion over 4 hours produced 7 +/- 2% (n = 9) lysis with solvent and dose-dependent progressive lysis with rt-PA; with 1 mg/kg, producing a plasma level of 0.20 +/- 0.03 microgram/ml, lysis was 56 +/- 7% (n = 7) by external gamma counting and 61 +/- 7% (n = 7) by residual radioactivity, without extensive consumption of fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin. CONCLUSIONS. These two thrombosis models in small animals are as reproducible and quantitative as the extensively used rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model. The hamster pulmonary embolism model is superior because it is simpler and more straightforward and allows the performance of as many as 10 experiments by one investigator in 1 day.\r"

  ".W": "A traditional concern with drugs administered during pregnancy has been teratogenicity or the production of gross structural malformations. Beginning in the 1970s, it became increasingly evident that the issue of drug safety and risk assessment went far beyond structural defects. During the 1980s, the newly emerged research specialty of \"developmental toxicology\" came to encompass a wide range of adverse toxic outcomes that include not only birth defects but also neurobehavioral and other functional effects as well. Substances of use and abuse--the opiates, cocaine, and cannabis--have come to exemplify a diverse group of compounds that produce a broad spectrum of developmental outcomes. Unlike alcohol, neither the use of heroin nor methadone during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of birth defects but both produce a neonatal abstinence syndrome that can persist for as long as 6 months; follow-up to preschool years suggests possible risk of attention deficit and problems of fine motor coordination. Methodologic weaknesses of opiate animal models, especially with respect of appropriate dosing schedules, have hampered meaningful extrapolation of these studies to human risk assessment. Given the renewed interest in methadone maintenance as an important therapeutic intervention to reduce exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus, better designed animal studies are needed urgently to assess developmental risk, but these must incorporate techniques that better model human pharmacokinetics. Animal models of early cocaine exposure, driven by human reports of serious risk to the fetus and newborn, have found reproductive hazard, risk of neurobehavioral effects as well as altered CNS function. Whereas animal studies need to explore routes of administration other than sc and ig, particularly the volatilized form of cocaine, to date it appears that the processes of somatic growth and morphogenesis in rodents are not as sensitive to cocaine as is the functional development of the CNS. Finally, animal studies of cannabis have taught us some major methodologic and interpretive lessons for the continuing development and refinement of animal models of drugs of abuse. Of particular importance is that poorly controlled experiments that do not adequately consider the confounding influences of maternal toxicity, both prenatally and postnatally, are likely to yield a high rate of false-positive results. This is well illustrated by those studies of cannabis that antedated the current concern for pair-feeding and surrogate fostering. Nearly all of the studies that failed to include nutritional and fostering controls found neurobehavioral effects that included changes in activity as well as impairments in learning and memory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

With the information now available, it appears safe to conclude that placental dysfunction due to cocaine's vasoconstrictive activity increases risk for intrauterine growth retardation and prematurity; fetal disruption due to acute cocaine-induced vascular compromise places the fetus at risk for structural anomalies; and neurotoxicity due to cocaine's action at the postsynaptic junction places the infant at risk for neurobehavioral abnormalities. There are now needed more sophisticated analytic techniques that can consider the additive and interactive effects of demographic and lifestyle characteristics that place the cocaine-using pregnant woman and her child at risk.\r"

Although substance use by adolescents and adolescent pregnancy have both been well documented and studied, substance use by pregnant adolescents is just beginning to be studied systemically. Current studies show significant substance use both by self-report and objective testing among pregnant adolescents, with self-report alone underestimating use. Early risk profiles show several significant risk factors for alcohol and drug use by pregnant adolescents. Future directions for work with substance abuse with pregnant adolescents include changes in practice behavior by physicians and other health providers, and family education and support regarding sexuality and substance use. Further research is needed to determine prevalence of substance use among pregnant adolescents, how better screening and early intervention can be implemented, and the long-term effects of substance use on the adolescent and her baby.\r"

As the prevalence is likely to be 10% or greater in any community, obstetricians need to employ measures to detect chemical use, similar to measures taken to detect birth defects, gestational diabetes, syphilis, gonorrhea, and preeclampsia. The use of screening protocols must be accompanied by an awareness of the need for intervention and treatment resources. Identification of perinatal chemical use should be for purposes of medical and social intervention, not criminal prosecution. Obstetric management should focus on the prevention of preterm delivery and intrauterine growth retardation. It should be recognized that pregnancy provides a unique opportunity for the encouragement of positive health behaviors. Programs that include such components may be able to achieve more lasting effects.\r"

At present, antiviral therapeutic trials do not include pregnant women or neonates less than 3 months of age.

Obstetricians will be involved increasingly in providing care to HIV-infected patients and educating patients in order to prevent HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "What do we know about marijuana use among women of reproductive age and about the use of marijuana during pregnancy? Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit substance, and after alcohol and tobacco, the most commonly used drug during pregnancy. Women who use marijuana are more likely to be white, younger, and to use other substances. The characteristics of women who use marijuana during early pregnancy are similar, although women who continue to use marijuana throughout pregnancy are somewhat different. These women are less-well educated, of lower social class, much more likely to use other substances, and more likely to be black. We do not know why some women use marijuana while others do not, and why some women discontinue their use during pregnancy while others do not. What do we know about the effects of marijuana use during pregnancy? A number of studies have investigated the relationship between prenatal marijuana exposure and outcome at birth. The results, unfortunately, are equivocal. Prospective studies that have examined women at regular and frequent intervals during pregnancy, in general, have not found a relationship between marijuana use and birthweight (Day NL, Sambamoorthi U, Taylor P, et al: unpublished data, 1990) although some have reported a small effect of marijuana use on birth length (Day NL, Sambamoorthi U, Taylor P, et al: unpublished data, 1990). Other studies, some prospective and some retrospective, have reported correlations between marijuana use during pregnancy and smaller size at birth. Several of these studies, however, failed to control adequately for other illicit drug use while one used marijuana only as a dichotomous variable in the analysis. Therefore, we do not yet know whether there is or is not an effect of marijuana use during pregnancy on intrauterine growth retardation. Only a few studies have reported on growth outside the neonatal period, and these studies have not found a consistent effect of prenatal marijuana exposure. There are, however, too few reports to assume that this is definitive. Several studies reported a relationship between prenatal marijuana use and the gestational age of the infant. As with growth, however, other studies have not corroborated these findings. Similarly, two studies have noted an increase in morphologic abnormalities, although one of these did not have a control group for comparison. Most studies have reported finding no relationship with either minor or major morphologic abnormalities. At birth, investigators have assessed the relationship between prenatal marijuana exposure and neurobehavioral outcome. Again, the results are contradictory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Because pregnant women generally are receptive to suggestions about controlling their alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the professional is presented with an excellent opportunity to encourage behavior modification. Early recognition of the alcohol-abusing women and appropriate counseling are the cornerstones of treatment for these patients.\r"

The sex ratio was 2.4 males to 1 female. Patch tests were conducted in 79% of cases. Wet work industries predominated in females; in males the causative industries were more varied. Apprentices were affected in a high proportion of hairdressers and food handlers. Atopics accounted for 75% of the apprentice hairdressers. Atopics also were more prevalent in females with OSD than males. 29% of all cases had suffered from OSD for over 2 years before diagnosis. 75% of patients with OSD were less than 40 years of age at onset of OSD. Irritant contact dermatitis predominated over allergic contact dermatitis in all age groups except those over 60 years of age. Nickel was the predominant occupational allergen in females, whereas chromate was the predominant occupational allergen in males. 46% had been in the causative occupation for over 2 years before developing irritant contact dermatitis. Some new occupational allergens have emerged in recent years. OSD in Western Australia does not appear to differ in any major way from that reported from other countries.\r"

Cases of allergic contact dermatitis due to the release of hexavalent chromium (Cr64) from chromated surfaces have been reported. The main purpose of the present study was to develop a simple procedure for the determination of leachable Cr64 that could be used in industrial applications to check the quality of chromated products and to establish a \"threshold limit value\" for such products. Occlusive tests were performed in chromate-sensitive patients using chromated discs, and discs representing a release of 0.6 microgram/cm2 or more elicited positive results in all patients tested. It was proposed that the mean release of Cr64 from chromated parts should not exceed 0.3 microgram/cm2. Approximately 1 out of 4 yellow chromated parts, collected from a chromating plant and a car assembly plant, gave values above this limit. Today, several tests are performed to evaluate the technical quality of the chromate layers. It is suggested that the present method should be added to the test program in order to reduce the risk of causing chromate allergy.\r"

The most frequent positive reactions were to nickel sulphate (18%), fragrance-mix (8%), colophony (6%), neomycin (6%), cobalt chloride (6%), thiuram-mix (4%) and potassium dichromate (3%). The frequency of negative D2, positive D4 readings was sizeable for all but one substance, primin, with a range of 14% for fragrance-mix to 64% for neomycin. All of 21 positive reactions to primin were recorded on D2. In our opinion, it is unjustified to perform D2-only patch test readings.\r"

The present study compared these steroids for screening in addition to a standard patch test series. Of 727 patients, 28 (3.9%) reacted to tixocortol pivalate and 10 (1.4%) to hydrocortisone-17-butyrate; hydrocortisone gave an allergic reaction in 2 of 521 (0.4%) patients. Serial dilutions suggested that tixocortol pivalate, not marketed in Finland, caused allergic reactions which could possibly be cross-reactions to hydrocortisone. In contrast to previously published data, frequent cross-reactions occurred with hydrocortisone-17-butyrate and tixocortol pivalate. All allergic reactions to other corticosteroids found by testing with tixocortol pivalate concurred with reactions to hydrocortisone-17-butyrate. The study suggests that the most effective choice for routine testing for corticosteroid contact sensitivity would be both tixocortol pivalate and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate.\r"

The scores and SVL values returned to near-baseline values when cutting oil application was stopped. In addition, the effect of 2 \"after-work\" emollient creams on 8 guinea pigs' skin repeatedly treated with a cutting oil was assessed by similar methods. The visual scores and SVL values of guinea pig skin that was repeatedly treated with the cutting oil and moisturized with \"after-work\" emollient creams, were significantly higher than negative and positive control guinea pig skin.

  ".W": "Because the pathogenetic understanding of diabetic vascular complications remains fragmentary, and even the best available interventions may prove insufficient to arrest the progression of certain lesions, new avenuses of investigation should be pursued. One of these should be the early in vivo investigation of the cells that endure the pathological process (pericytes and endothelial and mesangial cells), preferably in humans. The abnormal vascular architecture (i.e., capillary acellularity, microaneurysms, thickened basement membranes, and mesangial expansion) and the hemostatic and hemodynamic alterations observed in diabetes point to an adaptive/maladaptive replicative and biosynthetic program triggered by the metabolic perturbation, but positive documentation of cellular changes in vivo remains grossly insufficient. Critical review of current knowledge of microangiopathy permits elaboration of specific questions that, with the tools provided by the new molecular technology, may be posed about vascular cells in situ. Knowing whether and how the cell types involved in the vascular complications of diabetes modify their differentiated functions may offer novel targets for intervention and, most important, should provide a much needed \"sounding board\" against which to test the viability and refine the focus of pathogenetic hypotheses.\r"

Therefore, in the isolated rat pancreas, we 1) studied and compared the effect of increasing concentrations of NE and NPY given alone on insulin secretion induced by 8.3 mM glucose and on pancreatic vascular flow rate and 2) investigated the effects of combinations of NPY and NE at low concentrations. NE induced a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin release between 1 and 50 nM (max 80%); beta-cells appeared sensitive to NPY at 0.1 nM, but the maximal reduction of insulin release was comparatively weak (25-30%) at 10 nM. The study of the effect of combinations of NE and NPY at different concentrations suggests that the two neurotransmitters act in an additive way to inhibit insulin secretion. NPY (0.1-10 nM) induced a marked dose-dependent reduction of pancreatic outflow rate with a biphasic pattern between 1 and 10 nM. On the other hand, at low concentrations (1 and 2 nM), NE induced a progressive increase in pancreatic outflow rate; a clear but transient decrease could only be observed at 50 nM before a secondary increase. A combined treatment with two effective concentrations of NPY (0.1 nM) and NE (1 nM) resulted in a progressive reversal by NE of NPY's vasoconstrictive effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of insulin deprivation and replacement on adipose tissue metabolism were investigated in vivo with microdialysis in nine insulin-dependent diabetic patients with no residual insulin secretion. Dialysis probes, implanted in abdominal subcutaneous fat, were continuously perfused, and tissue dialysate concentrations of glycerol (lipolysis index), glucose, lactate, and pyruvate were determined. Comparisons were made with respective metabolite levels in venous plasma. After termination of intravenous insulin infusion, free insulin in plasma fell from 130 to 70 pM. At the same time, glucose levels in plasma and adipose tissue rose in parallel. However, the relative increase in glucose levels was greater in adipose tissue than in blood. On the other hand, the increase in glycerol concentration in adipose tissue (35%) was markedly less than that in venous plasma (250%). Lactate and pyruvate levels in adipose tissue and blood remained unchanged. After the resumption of intravenous insulin, free insulin in plasma rose to approximately 600 pM. At the same time, the glucose levels in blood and adipose tissue decreased rapidly, and the glycerol concentration in these tissues decreased to 50% of the baseline levels. The lactate and pyruvate levels in subcutaneous tissue increased briefly after insulin replacement, whereas the lactate but not pyruvate levels in blood showed a similar increase. The alpha- or beta-blocking agents phentolamine and propranolol in the ingoing tissue perfusate did not influence tissue glycerol at any time during the experiment. We concluded that insulin-induced changes in circulating metabolites only partly reflect variations in adipose tissue substrate kinetics. During insulin deprivation, glucose is accumulated in the adipose tissue extracellular compartment, probably because of reduced utilization by the adipocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have measured several physiological beta-cell function tests--fasting plasma glucose, glucose disappearance constant, fasting insulin, acute insulin responses to arginine (AIRarginine) and glucose (AIRglucose), and glucose potentiation of AIRarginine (delta AIRarginine/delta G) and two direct objective measurements (pancreatic insulin content [PIC] and quantitative beta-cell mass)--in adolescent male baboons (Papio anubis/cyanocephalus). We have correlated in vivo measurements obtained within 3 days after the animals were killed with in vitro estimates of PIC and beta-cell mass in 15 animals, (2 nondiabetic requiring insulin treatment and 13 after varying doses of streptozocin to induce degrees of beta-cell damage ranging from normoglycemia to severe hyperglycemia). There was a strong linear correlation between beta-cell mass and PIC (r = 0.79, P less than 0.001). Physiological measures of beta-cell function were significantly correlated with both PIC and beta-cell mass. The correlations between physiological measures and beta-cell mass were linear and intercepted the beta-cell mass axis at 0.15-0.2 g, suggesting that in vivo measures of beta-cell function approach 0 when there is still approximately 40-50% of the beta-cell mass detectable histologically. With PIC, the linear correlations intercepted the axes close to 0. These findings provide considerable validity to the measurements of beta-cell function used in preclinical IDDM in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The glycemic thresholds for both neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms (and those for both epinephrine and pancreatic polypeptide release) were at lower plasma glucose concentrations in both patients with defective (n = 9, 22%) and those with adequate glucose counterregulation and, among the latter, in patients with lower compared with higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels. The data are consistent with the concept that both defective glucose counterregulation and improved glycemic control contribute to excessive hypoglycemia in IDDM by reducing awareness of symptoms of developing hypoglycemia and by impairing physiological defenses against hypoglycemia. Thus, hypoglycemic symptom unawareness is multifactorial in origin and may be partly reversible.\r"

In study 1, LH or saline was infused at 0.5 and 1.5 ml/min for 2 h each. Plasma free fatty acids rose from approximately 0.4 to 0.8 mM with the low rate and to between 1.6 and 2.1 mM with the high rate. Similar increases occurred in plasma concentrations of glycerol, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. LH infusions resulted in significant increases in C-peptide concentrations but had no effects on any of the other measured parameters of CHO metabolism. In study 2, LH or saline was infused as in study 1, but the compensatory insulin release was prevented by intravenous infusion of somatostatin and replacement of basal insulin and glucagon concentrations. This resulted in significant increases in plasma glucose (from 4.5 +/- 0.2 to 7.1 +/- 0.6 mM, P less than 0.001) and hepatic glucose output (from 9.0 +/- 1.5 to 11.3 +/- 1.4 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05) and a decrease in glucose clearance (from 2.32 +/- 0.13 to 1.44 +/- 0.11 ml.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05). We conclude that lipids can have adverse effects on CHO metabolism under basal conditions and that healthy individuals can compensate for these effects with additional secretion of insulin.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we selected patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) and hypertestosteronemia and a group of individuals with adrenal hyperplasia (AH) and elevated DHEA and studied their 1) insulin and glucose responses to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, 2) insulin resistance by hypoglycemic responses to a standard dose of intravenous (IV) insulin, and 3) insulin binding and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) responsiveness to insulin in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated T lymphocytes. PCO patients exhibited elevated basal and glucose-challenged insulin levels and had blunted hypoglycemic responses to IV insulin. Conversely, AH patients had hypoglycemic responses to IV insulin significantly greater than and basal and glucose-challenged insulin levels lower than the PCO patients and weight-matched control subjects. In vitro, T-lymphocyte insulin binding of the PCO patients was 40-60% below control values; in AH patients, insulin binding and PDH insulin sensitivity were above those of the control subjects. Testosterone levels in all study subjects were negatively correlated to T-lymphocyte insulin binding and positively correlated to basal insulin, insulin area under the curve (AUC), and insulin-glucose indices. DHEA levels were positively correlated to insulin binding and inversely related to basal insulin, insulin AUC, and insulin-glucose indices. In all instances, the parameters of insulin sensitivity were more strongly correlated to individuals' ratios of DHEA to testosterone than to either of these androgens alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine this hypothesis, the extent of erythrocyte membrane protein glycosylation and the oxidative status of spectrin, the major component of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, were examined. Labeling erythrocyte membranes with [3H]borohydride, which labels glucose residues bound to proteins, revealed that several proteins were heavily glycosylated compared with nondiabetic erythrocyte membranes. In particular, the proteins beta-spectrin, ankyrin, and protein 4.2 were the most glycosylated. Although sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of diabetic erythrocyte membranes did not reveal any quantitative or qualitative abnormalities in spectrin or other membrane proteins, examination of spectrin oxidative status by amino acid analysis and with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) (cDDP), a chemical probe specific for protein methionine and cysteine residues, demonstrated that the diabetic spectrin was oxidatively damaged: spectrin from diabetic subjects contained 35% less methionine (P less than 0.002), 15% less histidine (P less than 0.006), and a twofold increase in cysteic acid (P less than 0.001) compared with normal spectrin. Diabetic spectrin bound 32% less cDDP than normal spectrin (P less than 0.001); the lowest cDDP binding was observed with spectrin from insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. The extent of cDDP binding to diabetic spectrin correlated moderately and inversely with glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb) levels (n = 12, r = -0.727). Erythrocyte deformability, measured by ektacytometry, was decreased between 5 and 23% of control measurements (average of approximately 10%) in 21 of 32 diabetic subjects surveyed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The levels of CIAAs in 30 relatives exceeded our upper limit of normal (greater than or equal to 39 nU/ml), and 30 had high-titer ICAs (greater than or equal to 40 Juvenile Diabetes Foundation units [JDF U]). Eleven of the HLA-typed relatives developed diabetes during follow-up. Twenty-three percent (28 of 123) of the relatives with at least one HLA-DR4 allele were CIAA+ (CIAA greater than or equal to 39 nU/ml) versus 4% (6 of 141) among DR4- relatives (P less than 0.0001). Twenty-one of 22 of the highest CIAA values were all in the DR4+ group (DR4+ vs. DR4-, P = 0.003, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test). HLA-DR3 did not correlate with the level of CIAAs, and neither DR3 nor DR4 correlated with titer of ICAs measured in JDF U. We conclude that, in first-degree relatives of patients with type I diabetes, there is a striking association with HLA-DR4 in both the prevalence of relatives exceeding the normal CIAA range and in the level of CIAAs. These data suggest that a gene on HLA-DR4 haplotypes contributes to the level of anti-insulin autoimmunity, and we hypothesize that DR4-associated diabetes susceptibility, distinct from DR3-associated susceptibility, may be secondary to this influence.\r"

The prevalence of the onset of diabetes in the CFA-injected versus uninjected NOD mice was 2 of 81 (2.5%) vs. 231 of 379 (61%) among females and 2 of 44 (4.5%) vs. 83 of 336 (25%) among males, respectively. The incidence of histologically identifiable insulitis was significantly reduced in CFA-treated prediabetic female NOD mice (18%) compared with the incidence in female age-matched controls (70%). Splenocytes or Mac-(1+)-enriched splenocytes from CFA-treated NOD mice, when cotransferred with splenocytes from diabetic mice, reduced the incidence of diabetes provoked by diabetic splenocytes in vivo. In the spleen, CFA injection induced sustained increases in cell proliferation and an associated major increase in the numbers of an immature cell type that expressed the Mac-1 surface antigen. In CFA-treated NOD mice, lymphocytes derived from the spleen failed to respond in vitro to stimulation by the mitogen concanavalin A or by anti-CD3. When cocultured, Mac-1+ cells, enriched from the splenocytes of CFA-treated mice, suppressed concanavalin A- or anti-CD3-induced proliferation of T lymphocytes derived from either the spleen or thymus of untreated NOD mice. Therefore, treatment with CFA prevents the development of diabetes, and concomitantly, insulitis while stimulating the generation of splenic suppressor cells that are capable of suppressing diabetogenic T-lymphocyte function in vivo and in vitro.\r"

After an oral glucose load (1.2 g/kg) spiked with [U-14C]glucose (16.9 muCi/kg; protocol 1, n = 7), arterial blood lactate increased from 0.43 +/- 0.03 mM at basal to a peak of 1.04 +/- 0.07 mM at 45 min and then slowly decreased to 0.47 +/- 0.07 mM at 240 min. Arterial blood [14C]lactate peaked at 60 min and then decreased slowly to approximately 35% of the peak at 4 h. When arterial blood lactate peaked at 45 min, the proportion of arterial lactate that was derived from oral glucose was 34 +/- 3%. The integrated area under the curve of lactate derived from exogenous glucose was 40 +/- 2% of that of total lactate. The splanchnic bed released lactate and [14C]lactate during the initial 2 h after oral [14C]glucose. Thus, the splanchnic bed apparently contributed to the conversion of exogenous glucose to lactate. In the matched experiments (protocol 2, n = 5), dogs were given the same amount of oral glucose but no [14C]glucose, and [U-14C]lactate was infused into the right atrium to match the splanchnic [14C]lactate release from the first experiment. Despite a well-matched splanchnic [14C]lactate contribution, arterial concentrations of [14C]lactate were markedly lower in protocol 2 compared with protocol 1. The integrated area under the [14C]lactate profile in protocol 2 was only 11 +/- 1% of that in protocol 1. These results indicate that the splanchnic bed is responsible for only 11% of arterial blood lactate that was derived from oral glucose. We concluded that 1) after oral glucose loading, a major portion of circulating lactate has its origin not in exogenous glucose but in endogenous sources, and 2) the splanchnic bed is not the major site of oral glucose conversion to lactate after glucose ingestion.\r"
