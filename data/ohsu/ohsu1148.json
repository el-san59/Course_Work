The patient survival is 92.7%, and the first graft survival is 87.3%. At a very high frequency, the patients achieved good graft function, and they had a relatively low morbidity that was partially ascribable to minimal use and early discontinuance (in 60% of cases) of steroids. Renal dysfunction and other adverse findings were largely confined to patients with poor initial graft function and consequent apparent alteration of the kinetics of FK 506 elimination, causing functional overdosage. Results compare very favorably with our past record using conventional immunosuppression, and support the belief that FK 506 is a superior immunosuppressive agent which is suitable for chronic administration.\r"

Late renal function has been generally satisfactory in all three cohorts of patients, and the incidence of hypertension has been low. The therapeutic index of FK 506 is a good one, as revealed by these observations in patients whose most notable achievement was a low mortality.\r"

A control group of the same age and with normal weight-for-height was also selected for this study. The fatty acid pattern of total phospholipids from plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) was determined and then used as a biochemical variable for evaluating EFA status. A sharp fall in the relative percentage of n-6 (omega-6) fatty acids concomitant with an increase in the n-9 fatty acids in plasma and RBC phospholipids was observed. These results are consistent with the picture of EFA deficiency and showed that the deficiency state is well correlated with the severity of malnutrition. Calculation of the product-precursor ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from linoleic acid (18:2n-6) in RBC phospholipids provides evidence for an impairment in the elongation-desaturation pathway promoted by the protein-calorie malnutrition.\r"

As 12:0 + 14:0 was replaced by 16:0, a significant decrease occurred in total and LDL cholesterol, whereas slight increases in total cholesterol and the LDL-HDL ratio occurred when 16:0 replaced 18:2. Hegsted and Keys regression equations provided a good fit for the observed data, but the predicted total cholesterol response was perfect (r = 0.995) for both equations when 16:0 was considered neutral. Thus, under these conditions 16:0 was less cholesterolemic than 12:0 + 14:0 and only slightly cholesterolemic compared with 18:2.\r"

  ".W": "The absence of intraluminal nutrients during weaning in rats was shown to result in altered intestinal growth and maturation. In this study intestinal length, mucosal weight, DNA, protein, and total disaccharidase activities were significantly lower in animals sustained by intravenous nutrients over the normal weaning age than were normally weaned controls but were greater than preweaning values. Absorptive capacity for sucrose (assessed by hydrogen-gas production) was diminished, directly linking incomplete maturation of sucrase to diminished intestinal function. To determine whether these alterations were permanent, rats previously deprived of intraluminal nutrients over the weaning period were refed. Eight days after refeeding, all variables except total lactase had attained values found in normally weaned age-matched controls, including absorptive capacity for sucrose. Although intestinal growth and maturation is abnormal in the absence of intraluminal nutrients during weaning, the abnormalities are not permanent and are rapidly corrected upon refeeding.\r"

There were no differences observed in hormonal responses to protirelin between patients and controls. However, higher Beck Depression Inventory scores were associated with smaller baseline-corrected maximal changes in thyrotropin responses. Cardiovascular responses to protirelin did not differ between a subgroup of 15 patients with panic disorder and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Although protirelin produced robust increases in heart rate and blood pressure, only one patient with panic disorder experienced a panic attack during the infusion. The hormonal findings suggest that the presence of depressive symptoms may have a significant impact on various indexes of neuroendocrine responsivity and should be taken into consideration when looking at biologic measures in patients with panic disorder. The cardiovascular and behavioral findings do not support the hypothesis that all panic-producing stimuli are nonspecific and suggest that the induction of physical stimuli may be insufficient to produce panic attacks even in susceptible individuals.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of increasing the concentration of sevoflurane anaesthesia on diaphragmatic function was investigated in six mechanically ventilated dogs. Diaphragmatic function was assessed by measuring the transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated during bilateral supramaximal stimulation of the cervical phrenic nerves at frequencies of 0.5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 Hz under quasi-isometric conditions. Measurements were performed at 1, 1.5 and 2 MAC concentrations after maintaining stable conditions for one hour. The Pdi-stimulus frequency relationship was compared at each anaesthetic concentration. The sequence of changing anaesthetic depth was altered in random fashion among animals. The Pdi amplitude generated by single twitch (0.5 Hz) was unchanged at the three concentrations. In addition, no change in Pdi during 10, 20, 50 Hz stimulation was noted at any of the three levels of anaesthesia. By contrast, Pdi with 100 Hz stimulation during 2 MAC sevoflurane exposure (28.1 +/- 5.0 cmH2O) decreased below Pdi levels seen at 1 and 1.5 MAC (35.3 +/- 4.3 cmH2O and 31.5 +/- 4.3 cmH2O, respectively) (P less than 0.05). From these results, we conclude that sevoflurane impairs diaphragmatic function in deep anaesthesia.\r"

Non-invasive monitoring has the advantage of providing continuous and instantaneous information and could reduce the frequency of arterial blood gas sampling. Twenty patients were studied to determine the reliability of capnometry and pulse oximetry in this situation. The effects of hypothermia and moderate haemodynamic instability were examined. A further 40 patients were then weaned using non-invasive monitoring. Correlation between PaCO2 and PETCO2 was 0.64-0.79 for the mass spectrometer and 0.67-0.81 for the infra-red analyser. No clinical problems arose. The detection rate for mild hypercarbia was 78.6 per cent and 50 per cent for hypoxia. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Once CO2 and O2 gradients are established, pulse oximetry and capnometry provide sufficiently reliable monitoring to enable weaning from IPPV, with the advantage of continuous display, and allow a reduction in the use of arterial blood gas analyses.\r"

Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and vecuronium. After tracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with 70 per cent nitrous oxide in oxygen, fentanyl 2 micrograms.kg-1, vecuronium 0.05 mg.kg-1 and 0.8-1.0 per cent end-tidal isoflurane. A caudal block was performed before surgery. Systolic arterial pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and end-tidal isoflurane were maintained constant. Ventilation was adjusted to achieve an end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) of 20 mmHg. The PETCO2 was then randomly adjusted between 20 and 80 mmHg by the addition of carbon dioxide from an exogenous source. Cerebral blood flow velocity increased logarithmically and directly with the PETCO2 (r2 = 0.56). There were no complications associated with the use of transcranial Doppler sonography. These data indicate that CO2 has a direct effect on the velocity of blood in the middle cerebral artery in infants and children anaesthetized with isoflurane.\r"

The rate of oedema formation during crystalloid cardioplegia and the relation of this to changes in ventricular compliance and ventricular function following reperfusion were studied using an isolated rabbit heart preparation. Myocardial tissue water content increased during cardioplegic arrest and the water content prior to reperfusion demonstrated an inverse correlation with ventricular function after reperfusion. In further studies the effect of adding mannitol to a standard crystalloid cardioplegic solution was investigated. The preparations were divided into two groups: nine were administered a standard cardioplegic solution (Plegisol*) (control group) and a further eight were administered the same solution mixed with mannitol to adjust the osmotic pressure to 360 mOsmol.L-3 (mannitol group). The mannitol group demonstrated less increase in RV water content and superior LV dP/dtmax following reperfusion. It is concluded that mannitol enhances protection of the myocardium during cardioplegic cardiac arrest.\r"

SETTING: General and open heart ICUs in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Convenience sample of 74 seriously ill patients aged 17 to 88 yr. Twenty had hypertension: postoperative (n = 7), neurologic damage (n = 6), miscellaneous (n = 7), and were prescribed nitroprusside (n = 11) or nitroglycerin (n = 9). Fifty-four had hypotension: septic (n = 33), other (n = 21), and were prescribed norepinephrine (n = 30), dopamine (n = 11), epinephrine (n = 8), or dobutamine (n = 5). An additional 21 trials were omitted from analysis because of technical (n = 7), clinical (n = 1), or drug-related problems (n = 13). INTERVENTION: Closed-loop and manual drug administrations 1-hr were studied during periods in each patient. The target and observed mean arterial pressure (MAP) and drug infusion rate were recorded electronically every 30 sec. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Time taken to achieve initial control (min); fidelity of control (the integral of size and duration of error from target MAP +/- 10% in mm Hg.hr/hr); and average drug dose administered (microgram/min as % maximum possible per drug). RESULTS: Compared with manual control, closed-loop achieved faster initial control (log-rank chi 1 = 5.04, p less than .05) and greater fidelity (mean 1.37 vs. 2.36; F = 7.15, p less than .01). There was no difference in average drug dose administered. There was uniformity in the efficacy advantage of closed-loop drug administration across drugs and patient classifications. CONCLUSION: The new closed-loop system is more effective than the usual manual control in managing acute BP disturbances in the seriously ill patient.\r"

The pigs were hemorrhaged stepwise to a BP of 80 and 45 mm Hg, followed by retransfusion. PtCO2 was measured in the groin and subcutaneous PO2 was measured in the hip region. Intraluminal PCO2 was measured in the stomach, in the small intestine, and the sigmoid colon using silicone catheters. A simultaneous determination of arterial blood HCO3 concentration allowed pHi to be calculated using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Cardiac output was determined by thermodilution, and oxygen delivery (DO2) was calculated. RESULTS: Early indications of shock were decreases in PtCO2 and intestinal pHi (p less than .01). All measured variables decreased at the second step of bleeding. PtCO2 and subcutaneous PO2 was correlated to DO2 through the entire experiment (r2 = .25 and .49, respectively). Also, the pHi of the small intestine and the sigmoid colon correlated with DO2 (r2 = .36 and .25, respectively). PtCO2 and subcutaneous PO2 correlated with pHi in the small intestine and sigmoid colon. CONCLUSIONS: PtCO2 and pHi in the small intestine and sigmoid colon were the variables that most rapidly indicated blood volume loss. Subcutaneous PO2 and PtCO2, and small intestine and sigmoid colon pHi were correlated to total body oxygen transport. Peripheral tissue perfusion followed intestinal perfusion to some extent.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Striking increases in PCO2 of the myocardium have recently been documented during cardiac arrest. The purpose of the present study was to investigate selective effects of hypercarbia as distinct from acidosis on left ventricular contractile function and oxygen utilization. An isolated, spontaneously beating rat heart preparation was utilized. The perfusate was equilibrated with gases containing 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30% CO2. In a subset of experiments, the [H+] was adjusted independently of PCO2 by decreasing the concentration of HCO3-. RESULTS: When the PCO2 of the perfusate was progressively increased from 36 to 146 torr (4.8 to 29.5 kPa), the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) generated by the isolated heart and the maximum rate of pressure change in the left ventricle (dP/dt) were decreased to 20% of their control values. However, comparable acidosis in the absence of hypercarbia produced only minimal decreases in the LVSP or dP/dt such that contractility remained at greater than or equal to 88%. Increases in the perfusate PCO2 but not in the perfusate H+ were highly correlated with decreases in both myocardial contractility and oxygen consumption (r2 = .88). CONCLUSION: Hypercarbia rather than acidosis accounts for decreased contractility and oxygen utilization in the isolated perfused rat heart.\r"

All animals underwent dilutional exchange transfusion with 200 mL of rabbit RBCs and 5% human albumin. Half the animals were then acutely hemorrhaged and subsequent aliquots of blood removed as needed to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 40 mm Hg. RESULTS: By 6 hr after production of dilutional coagulopathy, masses and plasma concentrations of fibrinogen and Factor II had increased modestly but significantly, and Factor VII mass and concentration and in vitro coagulation had returned almost to normal; plasma volume was unchanged in the normotensive animals. In the hypovolemic shock animals, where coagulant mass regeneration was as rapid as in the normotensive animals, a doubling of total plasma volume (p less than .01) prevented the concentrations of fibrinogen and Factor II, and hence the coagulation times, from improving. CONCLUSIONS: Dilutional coagulopathy corrects spontaneously within hours. Normovolemic shock prolongs dilutional coagulopathy not by impairment of factor regeneration but because of further (internal) dilution due to plasma expansion. Rapid correction of dilutional coagulopathy is likely to necessitate cryoprecipitate administration.\r"

It has therefore been suggested that the reduction of energy expenditure at night could result in improved inspiratory muscle function during the day. Reported successes with nocturnal ventilation have not included measurements of inspiratory muscle endurance. We therefore electively ventilated six (five female, one male) patients (mean +/- SD) aged 36 +/- 13 years in whom respiratory failure (room air PaCO2, 60 +/- 13 mm Hg; PaO2, 44 +/- 11 mm Hg; SaO2, 75 +/- 12 percent) was consequent on restrictive ventilatory disease (vital capacity, 25 +/- 7 percent predicted; FEV1/FVC, 81 +/- 12 percent; total lung capacity, 40 +/- 5 percent predicted; MIPRV -42 +/- 10 cm H2O; MEP, 81 +/- 28 cm H2O). Positive pressure ventilation was administered with a customized closely fitting nasal mask attached to a volume-cycled pressure-limited ventilator. Full respiratory polysomnographic measurements as well as arterial blood gases, pulmonary function, distance walked in six minutes, and inspiratory muscle endurance were measured at baseline and after 3 and 14 months of ventilation. Ventilation improved saturation (baseline on O2; SWS 87 +/- 10, REM 79 +/- 14, ventilator on R/A; SWS 90 +/- 6, REM 89 +/- 5 percent) and transcutaneous Pco2 (baseline on O2; SWS 85 +/- 26, REM 94 +/- 39, ventilator on R/A; SWS 53 +/- 9, REM 58 +/- 9 mm Hg). During ventilation, the quantity and distribution of sleep was similar to that observed prior to ventilation. Daytime gas exchange improved as did the six-minute walking test (initial test = 429 +/- 120 m, three months after ventilation = 567 +/- 121 m), both of these improvements being sustained at 14 months. Inspiratory muscle endurance measured using a pressure threshold load (mean mouth pressure = 45 percent MIPRV) improved from 7.1 +/- 3.4 minutes at baseline to 14.8 +/- 7.6 minutes at 3 months, an improvement sustained at 14 months. There was no change in measured lung volumes or respiratory muscle strength. We conclude that the improvement in nocturnal gas exchange, daytime functioning, and arterial blood gases resulting from nocturnal positive pressure ventilation is associated with an increase in inspiratory muscle endurance sustained at 14 months.\r"

Improvement in Pdimax was the best predictor of recovery (r = 0.48; p less than 0.001). Maximal inspiratory force correlated with Pdimax (r = 0.48; p less than 0.005), but FVC did not. The TTdi rarely exceeded the expected fatigue threshold of 0.15 in spite of the patient's inability to sustain ventilation. Although our patients demonstrated diaphragmatic weakness, TTdi did not demonstrate diaphragmatic fatigue.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to determine whether vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), reported to stimulate basal PRL secretion, affects PRL processing by lactotrophs. Initially, rat anterior pituitary quarters were incubated for 2 h with [3H]leucine, with and without 10(-5) M VIP, and immunoreactive and immunoprecipitable rPRL were measured during 56 mM KCl perifusion to determine total and 3H-labeled PRL, respectively. Inclusion of VIP increased immunoreactive PRL (P less than 0.05), decreased immunoprecipitable PRL (P less than 0.01), and, therefore, decreased the specific activity of labeled PRL (P less than 0.001). These results suggested an enhanced release of newly synthesized PRL before KCl depolarization, thus decreasing the release of labeled PRL. To discriminate between the two PRL pools, newly synthesized and storage, pituitary quarters were incubated with and without 10(-5) M VIP for 4 h with [14C]leucine, 2 h in cold medium and 2 h with [3H]leucine. Immunoprecipitable PRL was measured during perifusion with 56 mM KCl. Data were depicted as the 3H/14C disintegrations per min ratio of PRL released/3H/14C disintegrations per min of total tissue to account for any differences in tissue labeling. This ratio was greater for tissue labeled in the presence of VIP (P less than 0.002). To determine whether VIP, as a secretagogue, differentiates between the newly synthesized and storage pools, VIP was added after pulse chase, as previously described. No preferential release was observed between the two groups. Finally, using the same [3H]- and [14C]leucine-labeling protocol with and without 10(-5) M VIP, tissue was perifused with medium 199 for 1 h, with 10(-5) M TRH for 30 min, with medium 199 for 30 min, and with 56 mM KCl for 1 h. Inclusion of VIP increased the 3H/14C released/3H/14C total tissue ratio during basal perifusion (P less than 0.04) and TRH exposure (P less than 0.05). Within the control group, the TRH ratio was greater than basal (P less than 0.003). These experiments suggest that newly synthesized PRL is preferentially secreted over stored PRL from tissue incubated with VIP during pulse-chase labeling; however, addition of VIP as a secretagogue did not affect either PRL pool preferentially.\r"

  ".W": "A RIA for bovine (b) FSH-suppressing protein (FSP) was developed using an antiserum raised in a rabbit to purified 39-kDa bFSP, iodinated 35-kDa FSP as tracer, and purified 35-kDa bFSP as standard. Purified 35-kDa FSP was iodinated using the iodogen procedure, and the iodinated FSP was purified by dye affinity chromatography. After a logit log-dose transformation of the dose-response curves, parallel displacement lines were observed between 31-, 35-, and 39-kDa FSP, bovine follicular fluid, bovine granulosa cell culture medium, and medium from bovine granulosa cells stimulated with bFSH. The specificity of the assay was investigated by comparing the immunoassay levels of FSP with in vitro bioassay levels based on the ability of FSP/inhibin to suppress FSH in rat anterior pituitary cell cultures in fractions obtained throughout the purification procedure of FSP from bovine follicular fluid. This demonstrated that 1) the FSP immunoactivity was associated with in vitro bioactivity in all fractions of the purification procedure; 2) a number of inhibin-related and other proteins showed low (less than 0.5%) or nondetectable cross-reactivity in the RIA; and 3) the in vitro biological to immunological ratios for 31-, 35-, and 39-kDa FSP were similar, indicating that the RIA detects all forms of purified bFSP. The secretion of FSP by bovine granulosa cells in culture was investigated in the presence and absence of bFSH and bLH, respectively. FSP production was proportional to granulosa cell number and decreased from highest levels at 24 h to lowest levels at 96 h of culture. The addition of either bFSH or 8-bromo-cAMP to the culture medium stimulated FSP production by a factor of 2-3 at 48 and 72 h of culture, while the addition of bLH had no effect on FSP production. Theca interna tissue cultured under the same conditions did not produce FSP. In contrast to FSP, stimulation of bovine granulosa cells with bFSH or bLH had no effect on inhibin production during the 96 h of culture, while the addition of bFSH and bLH caused a stimulation of progesterone production at 48 and 72 h of culture. It is concluded that 1) the RIA described here is specific for all mol wt forms of bFSP; 2) FSP was secreted by bovine granulosa cells and not thecal cells in vitro; and 3) FSP secretion by bovine granulosa cells in vitro is regulated by bFSH and not bLH.\r"

Sertoli cells from 10-day-old rats were cultured on plastic and on different extracellular matrix substrates [laminin, a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel), and a synthetic laminin peptide containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide sequence] to investigate the effects of the extracellular matrix on FSH responsiveness. Both laminin and Matrigel markedly enhanced the cAMP response to FSH and cholera toxin, indicating modifications at the level of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory (G) proteins. Furthermore, Sertoli cell grown on either of these two substrates responded to physiological levels of FSH (25-50 ng/ml), whereas pharmacological levels of FSH (500 ng/ml) were required for cells grown on either plastic or on the RGD-containing laminin peptide. Immunoblotting of Sertoli cell plasma membranes with antibodies directed against the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G-protein (Gs alpha) of adenylyl cyclase indicated that Sertoli cell culture on either laminin or Matrigel increased the amounts of Gs alpha. These results were further confirmed by immunoprecipitating the Gs alpha protein from the particulate fraction of [35S]methionine metabolically labeled Sertoli cells. However, Northern blot analysis using a cDNA probe for Gs alpha did not demonstrate changes in gene expression when Sertoli cells were grown on the various substrates. Immunofluorescent studies revealed that the Gs complex of adenylyl cyclase was preferentially located at the base of the Sertoli cells at the site of contact with the extracellular matrix. These data suggest that culture of epithelial Sertoli cells on basement membrane substrates enhances the Gs complex of adenylyl cyclase and the cAMP response to FSH, consistent with the more differentiated morphology and function of the cells.\r"

  ".W": "Dexamethasone (Dex), when administered in high doses, has been shown to suppress spontaneous and GnRH-induced gonadotropin secretion, but the level and the mechanism(s) of this effect are unknown. We administered Dex to castrate testosterone-replaced male rats to determine if gonadotropin gene expression is affected and whether Dex differentially influences GnRH-modulated parameters of gonadotrope function: induction of GnRH receptors (GnRH-R) and gonadotropin synthesis and secretion. GnRH was given iv at 25 ng/pulse at 8, 30, and 120 min intervals for 48 h. Rapid GnRH injection frequency preferentially increased alpha and LH-beta messenger RNA (mRNA) responses to GnRH as well as LH secretion. Slower GnRH injection frequencies were required to increase levels of GnRH-R, FSH-beta mRNA, and FSH secretion. Dex selectively inhibited the serum LH, alpha, and LH-beta mRNA responses to GnRH, but not the serum FSH or FSH-beta mRNA responses. Additionally, it augmented the GnRH-induced increase in GnRH-R. We conclude: 1) induction of GnRH-R, gonadotropin synthesis, and secretion require different modes of GnRH stimulation; 2) Dex acts directly on the gonadotrope to differentially modulate GnRH-induced increases in GnRH-R levels, gonadotropin gene expression, and gonadotropin secretion; and 3) GnRH effects upon induction of GnRH-R, LH, and FSH synthesis and secretion are likely to be mediated via different cellular pathways.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was performed to compare and contrast the effects of two gonadal polypeptides, inhibin and follistatin, on ovariectomy-induced hypersecretion of FSH and LH. Ovariectomies were performed 1 week before study. Follistatin was purified from porcine follicular fluid, and human inhibin A was produced by recombinant DNA technology. On the day of study, a blood sample was taken from intraatrial cannulae inserted on the previous day, the materials were injected, and additional blood samples were taken at various times thereafter. Serum FSH and LH levels were determined by RIA. Both follistatin and inhibin exhibited dose-dependent suppression of circulating FSH but not LH levels, with initial decreases in FSH levels by both materials observed between 2-4 h post injection. Maximal suppression of FSH by each polypeptide occurred between 4-6 h depending on dose. Based on the dose-response relationships, it was determined that inhibin was approximately five times as potent as follistatin in suppressing FSH release. However, despite the greater biopotency of inhibin than follistatin, the duration of action of even the highest dose of inhibin (50 micrograms) was between 4-9 h, whereas the duration of FSH-suppressing activity by the two highest doses of follistatin (40 and 80 micrograms) was between 10-21 h. Data obtained from a second experiment conducted to examine the effects of inhibin and follistatin on anterior pituitary gonadotropin responses to LHRH were consistent with in vitro data showing direct pituitary effects of the gonadal polypeptides. Collectively, these results demonstrate that both purified porcine follistatin and recombinant human inhibin A profoundly suppress serum FSH levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with inhibin being more potent in this regard. Whereas the onset of action is similar for the two polypeptides, the duration of action of follistatin is longer than that for inhibin, suggesting, among other factors, different metabolic clearance rates or different pretranscriptional mechanisms of action of follistatin and inhibin.\r"

  ".W": "Canatoxin (CNTX), the toxic protein purified from Canavalia ensiformis, has been shown to induce secretion from different cellular systems through a mechanism involving a lipoxygenase-mediated pathway. Here it is shown that CNTX causes insulin release from isolated rat pancreatic islets. This effect is time and dose dependent, occurs in the absence as well in the presence of glucose, and is markedly reduced at lower temperatures (15 C). At 1-2 microM, the insulinotropic effect of CNTX is equivalent to that of 20 mM glucose, and the two responses are not additive. The stimulatory effect of CNTX is not caused by a toxic or lytic effect of the toxin on the islets, since islets once exposed to CNTX are able to respond a new insulinotropic stimulus. The phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine impairs insulin release induced by either CNTX or glucose. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenation of arachidonic acid, fails to affect insulin release, but two lipoxygenase inhibitors block it, and epinephrine reduces it. These data suggest that CNTX may act on islets through the same pathway as that used by glucose, with both effects being mediated by lipoxygenases.\r"

The present study was designed to examine the interaction between T and inhibin, in the presence and absence of GnRH, using dispersed pituitary cells in monolayer culture and cells perifused with pulses of GnRH from intact, 2-week castrated, and castrated T-replaced young adult male rats. The effect of partially purified inhibin from primate Sertoli cell culture medium (pSCI) to suppress basal FSH secretion was similar with pituitary cells from intact and castrated rats. T increased basal FSH secretion in the presence or absence of pSCI but did not alter the dose-dependent suppression of FSH by pSCI with cells from either intact or castrate rats. Castration increased basal FSH and LH secretion, whereas only basal FSH release was increased with cells from T-replaced castrates. T pretreatment increased the action of pSCI to suppress GnRH-stimulated FSH and LH release from perifused pituitary cells. These data indicate that T and inhibin exert opposite but independent effects on basal FSH release. The action of inhibin to suppress basal FSH secretion is not impaired by the absence of T and inhibin subsequent to castration. By contrast, the actions of T and inhibin to suppress GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion are coordinated and interrelated.\r"

TCB treatment did not affect hepatic uptake and metabolism of T3.

Measurement of the microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) activities confirmed that T4 UDPGT was induced by TCB, whereas T3 glucuronidation was unaffected. T3 UDPGT activity showed a discontinuous variation, which completely matched the genetic heterogeneity in androsterone glucuronidation in Wistar rats.

  ".W": "Recent observations disclosed the multiplicity of granulosa cell-derived high affinity insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) and revealed the striking ability of high doses of FSH to suppress their constitutive release under both in vitro and in vivo circumstances. It is the objective of this communication to characterize in greater detail the modulatory effect(s) exerted by FSH on the elaboration of IGFBPs by granulosa cells from immature, estrogen-primed rats. The ability of FSH to regulate the elaboration of granulosa cell-derived IGFBPs proved dose-dependent but biphasic in nature. Specifically, FSH concentrations in the range of 1-3 ng/ml applied for 72 h produced a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in polyethylene glycol-precipitable [125I]IGF-I binding activity corresponding to all IGFBP species detectable by ligand blotting. In contrast, treatment with higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 10 ng/ml) of FSH resulted in progressive dose-dependent inhibition of the constitutive release of IGF-I binding activity (80% inhibition at the 100 ng/ml dose level) and the virtual elimination of all detectable IGFBP species. Time-course studies disclosed a significant (P less than 0.05) initial (apparent at the 24-h time point) stimulatory effect of a high dose of FSH (100 ng/ml) corresponding mostly (but not solely) to the single minor (23K) IGFBP band. In contrast, more prolonged exposure to FSH (greater than or equal to 48 h) produced progressive time-dependent decrements in IGF-I binding activity, an effect associated with a decrease in the relative representation of the major band doublet (28-29K), the 23K species being all but eliminated under these experimental circumstances. Hypophysectomy produced significant (P less than 0.05) inhibition of the subsequent in vitro release of granulosa cell-derived precipitable IGF-I binding activity strongly suggesting that (presumptively stimulatory) pituitary principles other than FSH are likely involved in the regulation of granulosa cell IGFBP release and that the trophic influence of these putative agents appears to outweight the potential disinhibition of FSH hormonal action. Taken together, these findings indicate that the pituitary regulation of granulosa cell-derived IGFBPs is complex and is not FSH-exclusive. Our findings further indicate that the ability of FSH to regulate granulosa cell-derived IGFBPs is dose- and time-dependent but biphasic in nature, an effect characterized by an early low-dose stimulatory effect and a late high-dose inhibitory effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These findings, when viewed in light of differences in PRL cell responsiveness from one pituitary region to another, raised the possibility that suckling may influence responsiveness of cells in only a specific portion of the gland rather than in the entire pituitary. To address this issue, we evaluated cell responsiveness by performing plaque assays [with and without TRH, Angiotensin II (AII), and dopamine] on cells from two different regions of pituitaries from suckled and nonsuckled rats. These pituitary regions consisted of the inner zone, which is a central area proximate to the neurointermediate lobe, and an outer zone, which encompasses the remaining peripheral area of the anterior lobe. We found that inner zone cells from nonsuckled animals were highly responsive to dopamine and relatively unresponsive to TRH and AII. However, after suckling, a complete shift occurred with inner zone cells becoming sensitive to TRH and AII and resistant to dopamine. In contrast to these inner zone alterations, outer zone cells did not change after suckling, but remained responsive to TRH and AII and unresponsive to dopamine. Our results demonstrate clearly that suckling-induced alterations in PRL cell responsiveness to certain modulatory agents can be attributed to a discrete subpopulation of cells located in a specific region of the pituitary.\r"

In pituitary cell cultures without bicarbonate, GnRH-stimulated LH release was reduced by Na+ omission, by amiloride, and by amiloride analogs that selectively block Na+/H+ exchange. The Na+ dependence of amiloride action (EC50, 14 and 100 microM in medium with 20 and 135 mM NaCl, respectively, and no effect in Na(+)-free medium) and the order of potency of these analogs, indicated specific inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange. 5-(N,N-Di-methyl)amiloride (DMA; a potent Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor) reduced GnRH-stimulated LH release but not GnRH receptor binding or Ca2+ ionophore (A23187)-stimulated LH release, suggesting inhibition at a locus beyond receptor occupancy but before exocytosis. Amiloride analogs that selectively inhibit Na+/Ca2+ exchange also modestly reduced GnRH-stimulated LH release. Bicarbonate (10 mM) reduced the inhibitory effects of DMA and Na+ omission (but not the effects of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitors or of a Ca2+ channel antagonist), and the effect of bicarbonate was inhibited by a blocker of bicarbonate-dependent antiports. These observations reveal the Na+ dependence of GnRH action and that gonadotropes possess a Na+/H+ exchanger. The Na+ dependence of GnRH-stimulated LH release appears to reflect at least in part dependence upon this antiport. Prevention of the Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor effects by bicarbonate supports the specificity of their action, but suggests regulation of this antiport as an unlikely means of controlling LH release in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "During prolonged periods of reduced dietary energy, there is a reduction in secretion of LH in females. To test the hypothesis that decreased secretion of LH is due to reduced secretion of GnRH, 18 ovariectomized ewes were fed either a low-energy diet (LOW, 60% of the National Research Council recommendations, n = 12) or a normal diet, (control, n = 6), for 127 days. Each ewe received basal levels (approximately 5 pg/ml) of estradiol via sc Silastic implants. After 127 days, serum concentrations of FSH and LH were reduced (P less than 0.05) by 63% and 77%, respectively in LOW ewes compared to control ewes. Pituitary concentrations of FSH and LH in LOW ewes also were reduced by 56% and 80%, respectively. Compared to levels in control ewes, concentrations of messenger RNAs for alpha-, FSH beta-, and LH beta-subunits were reduced by 75%, 76%, and 91%, respectively. Pulsatile administration of GnRH (250 ng/2 h) for three weeks to LOW ewes restored each of the parameters to levels not different from those in controls. By the end of the study, serum concentrations of GH in all LOW animals had risen dramatically, but not in control ewes. Therefore, it appears that exogenous GnRH is capable of restoring synthesis and secretion of gonadotropins in ewes receiving low-energy diets. These results provide support for the hypothesis that reduced dietary energy results in decreased secretion of GnRH.\r"

  ".W": "The uterine cervix is a hormonally responsive organ whose function is tightly regulated during pregnancy. Interstitial collagenase is believed to play a key role in the mechanism of cervical dilatation. This study examines the hormonal regulation of procollagenase gene expression in primary monolayer cell cultures derived from cervices of 50-day pregnant guinea pigs. Procollagenase production was constitutive in these cells. Activity was stimulated up to 2-fold by interleukin 1 beta, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone. The effect of estradiol was completely inhibited by indomethacin and the estrogen antagonist, tamoxifen. The endogenous and the stimulated procollagenase were completely blocked by cycloheximide and by actinomycin D, indicating the need for protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis, respectively. Progesterone and 17-OH progesterone also stimulated procollagenase production at physiological concentrations (10(-8) M). The stimulatory effect of progesterone was blocked by the antiprogesterone RU38486. Procollagenase mRNA was stimulated by interleukin 1 beta (5 U/ml) and by 17 beta-estradiol (10(-10)-10(-8) M) and progesterone (10(-8) M). But progesterone at 10(-4) M completely blocked the stimulatory effect of 17 beta-estradiol on procollagenase mRNA. Increased availability of prostaglandins by mobilization of arachidonic acid by phospholipase A2 or by the addition of prostaglandin F2 alpha and prostaglandin E2 resulted in a 2-fold increase in procollagenase activity in culture media. These studies demonstrate that procollagenase gene expression is hormonally controlled in the cervix of pregnant guinea pig.\r"

  ".U": "91114677\r", 
  ".W": "Lactotrophs, somatotrophs, and thyrotrophs have been shown to contain immunoreactive galanin. Furthermore, estrogen stimulates galanin mRNA and peptide levels in the rat anterior pituitary, particularly within lactotrophs. To determine whether galanin is released from the anterior pituitary in a regulated manner, we used cultured pituitary cells from male and ovariectomized Fischer 344 rats implanted with estrogen-containing capsules. Anterior pituitary cells (5 x 10(5) cells/well) were challenged (0.5-3 h) with hypothalamic factors known to regulate anterior pituitary hormone secretion, and medium galanin levels were measured by RIA. In female pituitary cells, galanin secretion was inhibited by dopamine (10 and 100 nM) and stimulated by TRH (20 and 100 nM). Although galanin release was significantly lower in male pituitary cells, dopamine and TRH inhibited and stimulated galanin secretion, respectively. Medium galanin levels were also significantly reduced by somatostatin (5 nM) in both female and male cells. The pattern of PRL release in response to dopamine, TRH, and somatostatin was similar to that observed for galanin, regardless of the sex of the pituitary donor. Although galanin has been localized in somatotrophs, 5 nM GH-releasing hormone (GRF) failed to alter galanin release in male as well as female pituitary cells; GH secretion was significantly increased by GRF. LHRH (5 nM) and CRF (5 nM) failed to alter galanin release in vitro. We conclude that in estrogen-exposed pituitary cells obtained from male and ovariectomized Fischer 344 rats: 1) galanin secretion is inhibited by dopamine and somatostatin, and stimulated by TRH; 2) GRF, LHRH, and CRF do not regulate galanin release in these cells; and 3) the profile of the regulated pathway for galanin release suggests that the primary location of galanin is the lactotroph, probably within secretory granules.\r"

  ".W": "A previous study demonstrated that prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) stimulates a transient increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ levels [( Ca2+]i) in ovine large luteal cells. In the present study, the magnitude of the PGF2 alpha (0.5 microM)-induced calcium transient in Hanks' medium (87 +/- 2 nM increase above resting levels) was reduced (P less than 0.05) but not completely eliminated in fura-2 loaded large luteal cells incubated in Ca2(+)-free or phosphate- and carbonate-free medium (10 +/- 1 nM, 32 +/- 6 nM, above resting levels; respectively). Preincubation for 2 min with 1 mM LaCl3 (calcium antagonist) eliminated the PGF2 alpha-induced calcium transient. The inhibitory effect of PGF2 alpha on secretion of progesterone was reduced in Ca2(+)-free medium or medium plus LaCl3. Resting [Ca2+]i levels and basal secretion of progesterone were both reduced (P less than 0.05) in large cells incubated in Ca2(+)-free medium (27 +/- 4 nM; 70 +/- 6% control, respectively) or with 5 microM 5,5'-dimethyl bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid (40 +/- 2 nM; 49 +/- 1% control; respectively). In addition, secretion of progesterone was inhibited (P less than 0.05) by conditions that increased (P less than 0.05) [Ca2+]i; that is LaCl3 ([Ca2+]i, 120 +/- 17 nM; progesterone, 82 +/- 8% control) and PGF2 alpha ([Ca2+]i, 102 +/- 10 nM; progesterone, 82 +/- 3% control). In small luteal cells, resting [Ca2+]i levels and secretion of progesterone were reduced by incubation in Ca2(+)-free Hanks ([Ca2+]i, 28 +/- 2 nM; progesterone, 71 +/- 6% control), however, neither LaCl3 nor PGF2 alpha increased [Ca2+]i levels or inhibited secretion of progesterone. The findings presented here provide evidence that extracellular as well as intracellular calcium contribute to the PGF2 alpha-induced [Ca2+]i transient in large cells. Furthermore, whereas an adequate level of [Ca2+]i is required to support progesterone production in both small and large cells, optimal progesterone production in large cells depends upon an appropriate window of [Ca2+]i.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system inhibits insulin secretion. We tested the hypothesis that activation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on the beta-cell by epinephrine or clonidine attenuates insulin release by an effect on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) and examined the role of G-proteins in this signal transduction pathway. Using a cultured SV40-transformed hamster beta-cell line (HIT cells) as a model system, we determined the effect of alpha 2-adrenergic agonists on insulin secretion, 86Rb+ efflux (a marker for K+ channel flux), and the free cytosolic Ca2+ level [( Ca2+]i) monitored in fura-2-loaded cells. In a dose-dependent manner, epinephrine and clonidine (10(-8)-10(-5)M) attenuated the increase in [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion induced by either K+ depolarization or stimulation of the VDCC with the agonist Bay K 8644. Epinephrine failed to affect the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by carbamylcholine, an agent that mobilizes intracellular Ca2+. Epinephrine also did not changes 86Rb+ efflux from HIT cells. The inhibitory effects of epinephrine were prevented by the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist idazoxan, but were unaffected by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine. Pretreatment of HIT cells with pertussis toxin (0.1 micrograms/ml) overnight abolished the inhibitory effects of epinephrine and clonidine on both [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion. These data suggest that one mechanism by which alpha 2-adrenergic agonists inhibit insulin secretion is by inhibiting Ca2+ influx through VDCC, an action that is mediated through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein.\r"

  ".U": "91114688\r", 
  ".W": "We recently demonstrated that GH and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) act in a similar manner to prime macrophages in vitro and in vivo for enhanced superoxide anion release. In this report we investigated the physiological role of the pituitary gland and GH in in vivo priming of resident peritoneal macrophages for the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in vitro. Compared to normal rats, hypophysectomized animals had an 83% reduction in macrophage production of TNF alpha after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Sham operation had no significant effect on the ability of macrophages to secrete TNF alpha in response to lipopolysaccharide. Both native pituitary-derived porcine GH (48 micrograms/rat.9 days) and native pituitary-derived rat GH (96 micrograms/rat.9 days) more than tripled the in vitro production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (342 and 358 vs. 112 U/mg protein for placebo-treated rats, respectively). Each of these preparations of GH also increased growth more than 6-fold in hypophysectomized rats (32 and 30 g vs. 5 g in placebo controls). Heat inactivation of native pituitary-derived porcine GH significantly reduced its in vivo ability to augment both TNF alpha synthesis by macrophages and body growth. Recombinant rat IFN gamma (2000 U/rat.9 days) more than tripled the production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (343 vs. 112 U/mg protein). In contrast to its in vivo effects, addition of GH in vitro to macrophages from hypophysectomized rats did not prime these cells for the synthesis of TNF alpha, indicating an indirect mechanism of action for GH. To further test the biological relevancy of GH with respect to synthesis of TNF alpha, hemorrhagic necrosis of TNF alpha-sensitive murine methyl-cholanthrene-induced tumors was assessed in pituitary-intact mice. Native porcine GH (133 micrograms/mouse.7 days) significantly augmented both the necrosis to tumor ratio and the hemorrhage to tumor ratio. These findings establish the physiological relevance of the pituitary gland and GH in the priming of macrophages for TNF alpha synthesis.\r"

Prevention of meningitis by routine immunization of infants, who are at greatest risk, offers the only practical way of reducing the incidence of this disease. Widespread use of the recently developed protein conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b by itself could reduce the incidence of bacterial meningitis in the U.S. by more than half. To prevent disease caused by the other pathogens, an effective vaccine against the group B meningococcus must be developed, and the immunogenicity of the pneumococcal and quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines should be improved. Until such time that universal immunization of infants with highly immunogenic vaccines is possible, continued efforts must focus on targeting immunization at high-risk individuals and using chemoprophylaxis to prevent secondary disease where indicated. Addendum: On October 4, 1990, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration licensed the praxis Haemophilus influenzae type b-protein conjugate vaccine (Hboc) for use in infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with a booster dose at 15-18 months.

During the posttreatment colposcopic follow-up examination, all the patients demonstrated lesions colposcopically consistent with adenosis of the vagina or vulva within the area treated with the CO2 laser. Biopsies of the lesions were performed, adenosis was confirmed histologically, and endometriosis was ruled out histologically.

Contraindications to iodinated contrast agents included renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and contrast hypersensitivity. Sixteen aortic, 15 iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial, five aorta-iliac-femoral and four aorta-iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies were performed. In 11 studies, imaging of selected arterial segments required the addition of 10 to 60 ml of dilute nonionic contrast. Guided by carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies four femoral-tibial bypasses, three aneurysmorrhaphies, two aortorenal bypasses, one aortofemoral bypass and one femoral-femoral bypass were successfully performed in 11 patients. In addition, carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography directed angioplasties of the common iliac (4), superficial femoral (6), popliteal (3), or tibioperoneal trunk (1) were performed in 10 patients. Complications of carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography included transient deterioration in renal function in three patients in whom 20 ml of nonionic contrast was used, a nonfatal myocardial infarction after a popliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in one patient, and transient tachypnea and tachycardia during a carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography study in one patient. Diagnostic arteriograms are obtainable using carbon dioxide as the contrast agent. Carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography permits patients with symptomatic arterial disease at high risk for contrast related complications to safely undergo arteriography and subsequent arterial reconstruction or endovascular intervention.\r"

Individuals who survive cardiac arrest are at high risk for recurrent arrhythmias and sudden unexpected death.

Caring for the survivor of cardiac arrest requires a detailed clinical investigation to define the underlying cardiac anatomy and left ventricular function and to elucidate the mechanism and characteristics of the patient's arrhythmia. Appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy, such as drugs or a nonpharmacological intervention (eg, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), is then selected based on these considerations. In addition, ischemia is treated aggressively with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and, when appropriate, with surgical coronary artery revascularization.\r"

With fresh plasma samples, 3 donors and 6 recipients who were 4-RIBA positive were also PCR positive. 4 4-RIBA indeterminate and 78 4-RIBA negative samples of donors and recipients were PCR negative. Of 6 4-RIBA positive recipients, 5 were PCR positive four to six years later. 1.6% of the 383 recipients became chronically infected with HCV. The new 4-RIBA represents a candidate confirmation test to discriminate between infective and non-infective HCV C-100 ELISA-positive blood donors.\r"

Various methods of intraoperatively monitoring the facial nerve have been developed to reduce the incidence of facial paralysis. We report our experience with an intraoperative monitoring technique using intramuscular EMG electrodes to detect subclinical electrical responses that were amplified and made audible to the operating surgeon after gating stimulus artifacts. A 3.6% incidence of facial paralysis in 111 consecutive cases with this intraoperative monitoring method compared with 14.5% in 207 previously unmonitored cases indicates significant reduction of this complication in cerebellopontine angle surgery (p less than 0.001). Along with this reduction in facial paralysis, an increase in the percentage of partial facial paresis was observed in the monitored group (p less than 0.05). The percentage of those with intact facial function was similar in the monitored (82.0%) and unmonitored groups (78.3%).\r"

In three years' experience with the KTP-532 laser, 80 primary and revision stapedotomies have been completed by this author. The author's experience with low morbidity and high air-bone gap closure rates are presented. The absence of apparent cochlear injury suggests that properly used KTP laser systems are safe. Competitive results were obtained with less than prolific numbers of stapes surgeries.\r"

In most ears with Meniere's disease, the pressure necessary to indent the lateral semicircular duct is 2 to 3 mm of water. The pressure is more in those ears with a large negative summating potential than in those with a normal negative summating potential. The pressure is less after the shunt in the lateral semicircular duct is created and the negative summating potential returns to normal. In some ears with the classic picture of Meniere's disease, the endolymph pressure is normal and there is a normal negative summating potential. Presumably, one should not create a shunt in the lateral semicircular duct in ears with normal pressure.\r"

In the Palmerston North mouse, a model for systemic lupus erythematosus, sclerotic lesions consistently develop within the modiolus that are correlated with systemic autoimmune disease symptoms. No lesions were seen in 2-month-old mice, which is before autoimmune disease onset at 4 months. Lesions were first seen in mice at 6 to 8 months of age and increased in size and frequency thereafter. By 20 months, all ears examined had the otic capsule lesions, which were primarily perivascular in location and composed of both noncellular and cellular elements. The noncellular material was globular to fibrillar in arrangement and stained positively for calcium. The associated cells appeared to be metabolically active fibroblasts. It is proposed that the Palmerston North mouse may serve as a model to further investigate the role of autoimmunity in otosclerosis and other forms of otic capsule osteogenesis.\r"

In order to examine this possibility, microdensitometry was carried out on type I, type IIA, and type IIB fibers in the cat sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and thyrohyoid muscles using histochemical techniques for a variety of enzymatic markers of oxidative and glycolytic capacity and for fiber size. It was found that the infrahyoid muscles were composed of muscle fibers having enzyme profiles generally similar to those of fiber types in the limb muscles.\r"

These cases evaluated two encephaloceles, two postinflammatory dehiscences, two temporal bone fractures, one glomus jugulare tumor, one acoustic neuroma, and one meningioma. We found 3DCT useful in these temporal bone applications as a supplement to standard two-dimensional CT scanning (2DCT). While 3DCT provided a better preoperative understanding of the underlying anatomy, no treatment was modified solely on the basis of the information derived from the 3-D presentation of data. We conclude that, although 3DCT images have some qualitative advantages over 2DCT techniques, their value in further defining temporal bone morphology must be evaluated against the cost entailed by their use.\r"

A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) infuser is available that allows the patient to direct delivery of their own analgesia. The physician orders the narcotic analgesic dose to be given, the interval between doses, and the total amount of analgesic to be delivered over 4 hours. The patient simply presses a button connected to the analgesic infuser, which delivers a predetermined intravenous dose of the particular analgesic. The infuser is then \"locked out\" for an interval of 10 to 15 minutes before the patient can direct another dose of medicine. This system allows the patients to initiate intravenous delivery of their narcotic analgesic, and maintain control of pain, using small incremental doses of the analgesic agent. This PCA pump has been used successfully in a number of patients undergoing various general, head and neck, and facial aesthetic procedures. The general concept of the PCA pump, guidelines for use, and contraindications are presented.\r"

Temporary relief from symptoms has been reported in patients treated with botulinum toxin percutaneously injected into the thyroarytenoid muscle. A newly developed method of treatment differs from reported methods by increasing the accuracy of botulinum toxin placement, reducing soft tissue trauma, and applying basic scientific information about the functional histology of intrinsic laryngeal musculature. Sixteen patients with primarily adductor spasmodic dysphonia were treated. Initial assessment included laryngeal examination by indirect laryngoscopy, videoendoscopy, and stroboscopy, neurology examination (including laryngeal EMG), and vocal function studies with acoustic analysis and aerodynamic studies. A device originally designed for collagen injection allowed the precise microdelivery of toxin to the thyroarytenoid muscle. Indirect laryngoscopy was used to direct the needle, in an attempt to cover a broad area of motor end plates. The minimally effective dose was titrated for each patient, to avoid paralysis and preserve laryngeal function. All patients showed improved voices after treatment. There were no major complications. The basic technique can be performed in the otolaryngologist's office and does not require electromyography equipment or expertise.\r"

Although this entity has been previously reported, an association between maxillary sinus hypoplasia and anomalies of other paranasal sinus structures, such as the uncinate process, has not yet been described. Additionally, the literature lacks a system by which the various types of maxillary sinus hypoplasia can be classified using computerized tomographic (CT) imaging. Two hundred and two consecutive coronal sinus computerized tomographic scans from patients undergoing evaluation at our institution were analyzed to determine the prevalence of MSH and associated paranasal sinus anomalies. The overall prevalence of maxillary sinus hypoplasia was 10.4%. Three distinct patterns of hypoplasia were evident. Type I, characterized by a normal uncinate process, a well-defined infundibular passage, and mild sinus hypoplasia, occurred in 14 patients (6.9%). Type II, characterized by absence or hypoplasia of the uncinate process, an ill-defined infundibular passage, and soft-tissue density opacification of a significantly hypoplastic sinus occurred in 6 patients (3.0%). Type III, characterized by absence of the uncinate process and a profoundly hypoplastic, cleft-like sinus, occurred in 1 patient (0.5%). Recognition of associated anomalies of the uncinate process in patients with maxillary sinus hypoplasia undergoing sinus surgery is of utmost clinical significance because the uncinate process serves as a key landmark during functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Failure to recognize hypoplasia or absence of the uncinate process could lead to inadvertent intraoperative damage to the adjacent medial orbital wall.\r"

In situ oral cavity implantation has been documented, but its natural history is not defined. In light of this, an improved model is described. Forty-two nude mice had tumor cells from one of two established laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines implanted into the floor of the mouth. The tumor mass was measured and followed. When the tumor burden was great enough to cause cachexia, the animals were killed and submitted for microscopic examination. Pulmonary metastases were noted in 44%, bone invasion in 80%, angioinvasion in 76%, and soft tissue invasion in 96% of the animals. Growth characteristics in the head and neck have not been documented in previous models. Our model not only exhibits the locally invasive activity typically associated with malignant neoplasms, but also closely parallels the results of clinical studies examining the percent of end stage patients and autopsies with pulmonary metastases. Therefore, this model should open the way for more meaningful in vivo studies of nonsurgical treatment modalities for both local and metastatic tumor foci in head and neck cancer.\r"

The development of methods for spatial localization by use of multiply tuned radio frequency coils that permit the measurement of multiple nuclear MR spectra (1H and 31P) from precisely defined volumes of interest has provided a basis for integrating spectroscopy into the clinical MRI examination. This offers a means for noninvasive monitoring of relative concentrations of mobile metabolites within a tumor. With the use of imaging to determine proper coil placement, a test-retest variance of about 17% is seen on MR spectroscopy. Data are presented from MRI/MRS studies for four head and neck lesions: (1) a squamous cell carcinoma of the lip; (2) a juvenile angiofibroma extending into the nasal cavity; (3) a massive chondrosarcoma of the nasal septum; and (4) a cervical nodal metastasis of a squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx. Spectra are evaluated by comparison of relative concentrations of phosphorus compounds. The concentrations of phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters are significantly higher in the neoplasms studied than in normal skeletal muscle. The developing role of integrated MRI/MRS to monitor the response of malignant neoplasm to radiation therapy is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91117459\r", 
  ".W": "Nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) has become the predominant cause of both acute suppurative otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion. It has now been well-demonstrated that both outer membrane proteins and restriction fragment analysis of the bacterial genomes of concomitant nasopharyngeal and middle ear effusion isolates of NTHI are identical. It is therefore of critical importance to understand the mechanisms whereby bacteria that are present in normal healthy children in small numbers become the predominant organism in the nasopharynx in otitis media. The studies presented here suggest that nontypable Haemophilus influenzae can effectively decrease ciliary function as measured by stroboscopic illumination of ciliary beat frequency on human adenoidal organ culture. This organism also produces significant histopathologic and ultrastructural damage to the epithelial cells and cilia of adenoid organ culture, demonstrated by both light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The data suggest the following hypothesis: nontypable Haemophilus influenzae can destroy mucociliary function and allow increased bacterial replication in the mucus overlying the nasopharyngeal mucosa. The mucociliary system of the eustachian tube may also be involved in a similar manner, thus allowing bacteria to enter the middle ear space via the eustachian tube.\r"

  ".W": "Radiation therapy has been the treatment most frequently used for early vocal cord cancer with surgery usually in the form of total laryngectomy held in reserve as a salvage option. We report our experience in selected patients who, having failed radiation therapy for their early vocal cord cancers, underwent frontolateral hemilaryngectomy as attempted salvage surgery. Between 1977 and 1986, fourteen patients at the University of Pittsburgh Eye and Ear Hospital underwent hemilaryngectomy for salvage of their stage I vocal cord squamous cell carcinoma after full-course radiation therapy had been unsuccessful. Over this same time period, 77 patients underwent total laryngectomy for salvage of radiation therapy failure. Three patients failed hemilaryngectomy, two of whom were ultimately salvaged with total laryngectomy. Thus a 79% salvage rate was achieved with hemilaryngectomy with an average followup of 90 months. The overall cure rate was 93% (13 of 14) with voice preservation in 86% (12 of 14). Decannulation, postoperative infection, and initiation of oral intake were not influenced by age. Such problems occurred more often in patients undergoing radiation therapy compared to those undergoing hemilaryngectomy without previous radiation therapy. These results indicate that hemilaryngectomy may be used for the salvage of radiation therapy failures of stage I vocal cord carcinoma with good success and without undue morbidity.\r"

We describe the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these patients, as well as reasons for each occurrence. Sporadic reports of angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitor therapy have appeared in the literature. This represents the first time a significant series of patients from the same institution have encountered this complication over a short period of time, suggesting that the complication may be much more common than has been thought.\r"

For comparison, the same enzyme activities were measured in extraocular muscle tissue and in three hindlimb muscles rich in either slow oxidative (soleus), fast glycolytic (white part of vastus lateralis), or fast oxidative glycolytic (plantaris) muscle fibers. ChAT and AChE activities were much higher in middle ear muscles than in hindlimb muscles, consistent with a denser neuromuscular innervation, as in extraocular muscles. By contrast, MDH and LDH activities were remarkably low in the middle ear muscles, lower than in any of the hindlimb muscles or the extraocular muscles. Denervation of the stapedius muscle by peripheral transection of the facial nerve resulted in decreases in all four enzyme activities without associated changes in the tensor tympani. Surgical ablation of the peripheral facial nerve supply to the stapedius muscle appears to be a feasible option for producing its denervation. The results suggest some rather specialized chemical characteristics for the middle ear muscles.\r"

The charts of 444 patients with laryngeal cancer who were treated surgically between 1976 and 1988 revealed stomal recurrence in 15 (3.4%). Eighty percent of the patients with stomal recurrence had tumors in the subglottis. In comparison to patients with different sites involved this was significant (p less than 0.001). Other variables examined and analyzed included primary stage, previous treatment, neck pathologic status, neck treatment, age, sex, postoperative adjunctive therapy, and timing of tracheotomy. Tumor involvement of the subglottis is the single most important variable in stomal recurrence of carcinoma. Previous conservation laryngeal surgery and preoperative/emergency tracheotomy are not related to stomal recurrence of carcinoma. Mean length of survival for patients with stomal recurrence of carcinoma in our series was 8.9 months. Two patients were successfully treated with extensive surgical resection. The dismal prognosis of stomal recurrence of carcinoma suggests that management of this condition should focus on prevention. Treatment of patients with tumors of the subglottis should include attention to the paratracheal region and superior mediastinum, in conjunction with laryngectomy immediately after initial diagnosis.\r"

Morphometric analysis showed that both indomethacin and calcitonin inhibited active otosclerosis-like lesions (bone resorption) and rats immunologically induced with type II collagen, and indomethacin had a much higher inhibitory effect than calcitonin. In in vitro studies we found that conditioned medium from splenic lymphocytes of rats immunized with type II collagen stimulated collagenase production by macrophages and fibroblasts. Collagenase is the major enzyme for degradation of the organic components of bone. Treatment of the immunized rats with indomethacin and calcitonin significantly reduced the stimulatory effect of the lymphocyte-conditioned medium on collagenase production. Indomethacin caused a greater reduction of the stimulatory effect of the lymphocytes on collagenase production than calcitonin. These findings are in agreement with results of the morphometric study. Results of the present study also suggest that cell-to-cell interaction plays an important role in collagenase production for degradation of organic components of bone resorption in otosclerotic lesions.\r"

Fungal sinus diseases run the gamut from allergic fungal rhinitis and allergic fungal sinusitis, through fungus balls, to invasive and fulminant fungal sinusitis. Allergic fungal sinusitis may be thought of as the sinus counterpart of allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease. Patients typically are first seen with chronic sinusitis. They may be atopic, and the peripheral blood often shows elevated IgE levels and absolute eosinophil counts. Such patients may be managed conservatively, requiring only surgical drainage and corticosteroid therapy. Fungus balls are typified by the so-called \"aspergilloma.\" Although patients often have some predisposing factor, such as local tissue hypoxia or massive fungal exposure, most patients are not immunocompromised. Fungus balls may be treated with the traditional Caldwell-Luc operation or with newer endoscopic procedures. Invasive or fulminant fungal sinusitis generally occurs in immunosuppressed patients and merits aggressive surgical excision and debridement, as well as systemic chemotherapy, usually amphotericin B. In this article, we review fungal disease of the paranasal sinuses and present findings from our review of patients with chronic sinusitis.\r"

Thirty-seven patients underwent thirty-eight gold weight upper lid implants to rehabilitate paralysis of the eyelid from various causes. When indicated, implantation was combined with lower lid ectropion repair, medial canthoplasty or brow lift. Because of encouraging results in patients with longstanding facial paralysis, \"early\" implantation (within 1 month of paralysis) was offered to patients with severe lagophthalmos in whom (1) a severe neural injury was documented at the time of transtemporal surgery or (2) delayed, incomplete return of function was expected. Gold weight implantation resulted in excellent eyelid closure, protection, and cosmesis. There were no infections or extrusions. Lagophthalmos and exposure keratitis resolved or were significantly improved in all patients, and most were able to dispense with eyedrops and salves. Visual acuity improved in 95% of patients--a benefit even those without preoperative keratitis often achieved. A mild worsening of one patient's pre-existing astigmatism developed, which resolved after reimplantation with a lighter weight. The implant is easily removed from those patients who, having undergone early implantation, eventually recover adequate function. Gold weight loading has become our procedure of choice for eyelid rehabilitation.\r"

This study correlates excitability with histologic characteristics of muscles reinnervated via nerve-muscle pedicles (NMP) and direct nerve implants (DNI). Strength duration curves were measured in 13 rabbits 3.5 to 5 months after reinnervation by NMP (n = 6) and DNI (n = 7). Following this, control (n = 5) and reinnervated straps were harvested immediately before the animals were killed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The material was submitted for hematoxylin-eosin stains as well as trichrome stains for general morphology, myofibrillar ATPase and NADH for fiber typing, and cholinesterase for determination of denervated fibers. In all animals with low chronaxie, expected type grouping from reinnervation was noted (n = 10). By contrast, the three animals in which chronaxie was abnormally elevated demonstrated fibrosis, inflammation, and absence of or poor type grouping. This suggests that type grouping is necessary for excitability after reinnervation of paralyzed striated muscles.\r"

  ".W": "A combined hyperthermia and chemotherapy approach was used to treat five patients with locally advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck whose tumors had failed to respond to chemotherapy. In two patients, tumor had recurred after initial combined modality therapy (surgery/radiation) and had failed to respond to one course of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (cisplatin/5-FU) chemotherapy. The three remaining patients were enrolled onto a phase II evaluation of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin/fluorouracil for advanced head and neck carcinomas and had failed to achieve a partial remission after one treatment cycle. Palpable cervical tumors were heated to 40 degrees to 42 degrees C for 30 to 40 minutes, during which time cisplatin (100 mg/m2) was infused intravenously. A 5-day infusion of 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2/d) followed. Despite less than a partial response to previous cisplatin/fluorouracil chemotherapy alone, two patients had complete clinical resolution of the heated tumor volume with two cycles of the combined thermochemotherapy approach. One patient achieved a partial remission with this approach. The remaining two patients died shortly after the initial thermochemotherapy treatment, as a result of progressive tumor growth. The two complete responders were subsequently treated with radiation (1 patient) and radical neck dissection (1 patient) and remained without evidence of disease 2 and 26 months after the completion of therapy, respectively. The toxicity of this combined modality approach was acceptable and appeared to be no greater than had been experienced during earlier treatment with chemotherapy alone. Further studies using a combination of these treatment modalities for locally advanced head and neck carcinomas are warranted.\r"

Epiglottitis is thought to be more common in children than in adults, but this relation has never been clearly established. This article attempts to evaluate the incidence of this disease. A review of the literature regarding the incidence is correlated to new data from the 1981 Census of Canada and the Med-Echo System of the province of Quebec. It suggests that the incidence rate is approximately 60/million for children (1/17,000), whereas it is 10/million for adults (1/103,000). These rates are based on the analysis of 712 pediatric cases and 257 adult cases. After a review from various sources, my estimation is that a slightly lower than 3-to-1 ratio of cases is probable between the pediatric and adult cases of acute epiglottitis.\r"

Measurement of transit time of a droplet of Tc-99m phytate on the nasal mucosa appears to differentiate patients with immotile cilia syndrome from normal controls. A positive test, however, can occur also in smokers and in patients with other nasal and paranasal problems. The test is reproducible, cost-effective, and noninvasive, enabling the clinician to make a more appropriate selection of patients needing further investigation.\r"

The experimental model of otitis media was developed by inoculation of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa suspension. When HRP could penetrate into the inner layer of a normal RWM, the duration of HRP instillation into the round window niche was 10 minutes. The permeability of the RWM in otitis media was as follows: 3-day animals showed penetration of HRP into the middle layer. In 1-week animals, HRP had penetrated into the inner layer in all 10 ears. In 2-week animals, HRP had penetrated into the inner layer in 6 of 11 ears. In 4-week animals, however, HRP was not seen in 6 of 7 ears. HRP had penetrated through the damaged focus of the epithelial cells by inflammation. These results suggest that any derangement of the epithelial linings could increase the penetration of HRP and also ototoxic materials into the inner ear through the RWM.\r"

The animals used for acute observation were killed immediately for morphologic studies; those used for long-term observation were kept alive for 2, 4, or 10 weeks. Acute observation revealed that sensory and supporting cells were elevated from the basement membrane only in the irradiated area. No rupture of the membranous labyrinth was observed. Long-term observation revealed that the otolith of the macula utriculi had disappeared in 2-week specimens. The entire macula utricili had disappeared in 10-week specimens. No morphologic changes were observed in cochlea, semicircular canals, or membranous labyrinth. The saccule showed similar changes.\r"

Today's preferred methods of repair are transnasal and transpalatal. Each method has its advantages, disadvantages, proponents, and opponents. The main disadvantage of the transnasal procedure is limited vision, even with a microscope, especially in newborn infants, and the inability to adequately remove enough vomerine septal bone to prevent restenosis. Endoscopic transnasal repair of choanal atresia provides excellent visualization and the ability to perform exact surgery on patients of all ages. Described are four patients who underwent endoscopic repair of choanal atresia. Three of the four have patent nares, one patient after revision surgery. The technique is discussed along with its advantages and disadvantages relative to other surgical treatment modalities.\r"

  ".U": "91117490\r", 
  ".W": "Oxygen free radicals have been implicated in postischemic tissue damage in a variety of experimental models including the island skin flap. Previous studies have demonstrated that supplementing animals with exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD), a free radical scavenger, improves tissue survival in island flaps. No studies to our knowledge have attempted to inhibit endogenous SOD in a skin flap model. In this experiment 20 control rats demonstrated a 12.00% flap necrosis 7 days after a modified ventral island skin flap was raised. A second group of 20 rats were supplemented with exogenous SOD (50,000 U/kg 30 minutes preoperatively and 12 hours postoperatively) and demonstrated a statistically significant decreased flap necrosis of 5.28%. A third group of 20 rats received diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC, 0.5 gm/kg 12 hours preoperatively), an agent previously shown to inhibit SOD, and demonstrated a statistically significant increased flap necrosis of 19.77%. In a final group of 20 rats the effect of DDC was overcome by supplementation with exogenous SOD, obtaining a flap necrosis of 8.35%. Our results add further support to the importance of SOD and oxygen free radicals in postischemic tissue damage by demonstrating increased tissue necrosis with inhibition of endogenous SOD. This suggests that there is a baseline degree of SOD activity in ischemic areas working to preserve tissue. It appears that the copper-containing species of SOD found primarily in the cytoplasm plays a pivotal role in preservation of postischemic tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The development of valid objective measurements of vocal cord vibration during phonation is a goal of current research in laryngeal physiology. An excised canine larynx was used to study the effects of vocal cord tension, air flow rate, and glottic width on glottographic parameters. The electroglottographic and photoglottographic wave-forms were simultaneously recorded as the vocal cord tension, glottic width, and air flow rate were systematically varied. These glottographic waveforms were analyzed to determine the open quotient and speed quotient. Multiple regression analysis of the data obtained from 10 larynges showed the open quotient to be directly related to vocal fold tension (p less than 0.001), glottic width (p less than 0.01), and fundamental frequency (p less than 0.001). Speed quotient was inversely related to glottic width and and subglottic pressure (p less than 0.05). Regression analysis also showed frequency of vibration to be directly related to tension (p less than 0.001) and inversely related to glottic width (p less than 0.001), with different combinations of glottic tension and width capable of producing the same frequency. The open and speed quotients thus reflect the changes in the vibratory patterns of the vocal folds produced by alterations in tension and width. The clinical implications of these results will be discussed, with emphasis on glottography as an objective assessment of the various laryngeal framework procedures being performed.\r"

In the epithelium of supra- and subglottic regions, a dense distribution of substance P (SP)- and calcitonin gene-related polypeptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive (IR) nerve fibers was observed. Some vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-IR intraepithelial nerve fibers were also seen in the subglottic region. In the laryngeal glands, a dense distribution of VIP-IR nerve fibers with a few SP- and enkephalin (ENK)-IR nerve fibers were found around the acini. In the walls of arteries in the lamina propria, many VIP-, SP-, and CGRP-IR nerve fibers were seen, whereas neuropeptide Y-, ENK-, and VIP-IR nerve fibers were predominantly distributed around the arteries in the vocal muscle. In the free edge of the vocal cord, few immunoreactive nerve fibers were detected within the epithelium and around the arteries in the lamina propria. These results suggest that there are regional differences in the occurrence of peptides in nerve fibers innervating the epithelium and the blood vessels in the larynx and that the perception mechanism of the epithelium and the regulatory system of local blood flow are varied according to their location in the larynx.\r"

Intraoperative comparisons were made between the two methods with regard to blood loss and operating time. Postoperatively bleeding and healing time were also recorded. A questionnaire answered on a daily basis assessed the patient's pain. Disadvantages of the KTP/532 tonsillectomy included increased cost, increased total operating time as a result of increased setup time and laser malfunctions, delayed healing, and no statistically significant improvement in level of pain.

  ".W": "The eradication of basicranial meningiomas by traditional surgical techniques is often hindered by neoplastic entanglement with critical neurovascular structures. Apparent, complete tumor resection is frequently followed by extensive, yet clinically silent, recurrent disease with local infiltration of bone, cranial nerves, and brain. Fifty-five cases of sphenoid wing or parasellar meningioma were analyzed to identify clinical manifestations suggestive of early tumor recurrence. Regrowth patterns were then defined according to preoperative radiographic and intraoperative surgical findings. Medial tumor regrowth, involving the cavernous sinus, caused neurapraxia of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, with associated diplopia or ophthalmoplegia. Inferior (caudal) regrowth of disease involved the infratemporal fossa, pterygomaxillary space, or paranasal sinuses by bony erosion of the middle cranial fossa floor or through natural anatomic foramina and fissures. Such inferior extension was manifested clinically by facial hypesthesia, trismus, and referred otalgia caused by trigeminal nerve involvement and by autophony or serous otitis media related to eustachian tube obstruction. Posterior tumor regrowth occurred along the petrous bone and horizontal carotid canal, resulting in internal auditory meatus erosion and cerebellopontine angle extension with associated tinnitus, hearing loss, unsteadiness, and occasional facial twitching. While the clinical and radiographic evaluations of any patient with a suspected recurrent basicranial meningioma are critical in planning the method and magnitude of reoperation, an understanding of potential recurrence patterns can be used in devising more extensive, combined approaches that may allow complete tumor extirpation at the initial surgical intervention.\r"

The diagnosis of PLF has been based on the subjective evaluation of vestibular function tests and the intraoperative macroscopic visualization of \"clear fluid\" from the oval/round windows at the time of exploratory tympanotomy. However, the subjective visual characterization of PLF varies among observing surgeons. Furthermore, perilymph can be \"contaminated\" with serum, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and local anesthesia. This article presents a scientific biochemical microassay for the free amino acid profile of perilymph. Microaliquots of uncontaminated perilymph were sampled from the bilateral round windows (scala tympani) of 20 guinea pigs and analyzed for 19 free amino acid concentrations (FAAC) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These samples were compared with the FAAC of guinea pig serum samples. Perfect predictor value ranges were nonoverlapping for 12 of 19 free amino acids in perilymph vs. plasma. Amino acid microassay of middle ear fluid for verification of \"true\" perilymph vs. nonperilymph fluids by the identification of nonoverlapping FAA markers may allow scientific verification of the existence of PLF in \"suspected\" patients.\r"

Blood flow measurements were taken on each animal just before each inflation, immediately after inflation, and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 hours after expansion. Measurement of flow changes immediately after each inflation of the expander showed that, initially, blood flow in the tissue overlying the expander recovered quickly, but as the expansion process was continued, the flow did not return to baseline values so rapidly. This might be an indication that tissue expansion in patients could be carried out more rapidly during the initial inflations, with increasing recovery periods between inflations as the expansion process continued.\r"

Followup ranged from 6 months to 4 years. Hearing results were similar in the two groups (71% with air-bone gap less than 30 dB). There were no instances of facial nerve injury or sensorineural hearing loss. Facial nerve monitoring was used. Complications of stenosis and drainage were more common with the transmastoid approach. In both groups, hearing results were accomplished with the patients' intact ossicles or prosthetic reconstructions. Meticulous soft-tissue technique, with split-thickness grafts covering all exposed bone, is the key to preventing stenosis. For the three cases of patients with thick, acellular atresia plates, a different approach was developed. Maintaining proper orientation during the medial dissection is more difficult in these cases. By opening the antrum primarily and identifying the lateral canal, ossicles, and facial nerve, an ear canal can then be created anteriorly with these landmarks in view. An intact canal wall-like procedure is carried out. Although hearing results are similar, the anterior approach, because of fewer postoperative complications, is now our procedure of choice. Proper orientation and soft-tissue technique are the keys to successful correction of the congenitally atretic ear canal.\r"

A complementary DNA clone for a protein that bound to regulatory elements of the apoAI gene was isolated. This protein, designated apoAI regulatory protein-1 (ARP-1), is a novel member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. ARP-1 bound to DNA as a dimer, and its dimerization domain was localized to the COOH-terminal region. ARP-1 also bound to a thyroid hormone-responsive element and to regulatory regions of the apoB, apoCIII, insulin, and ovalbumin genes. In cotransfection experiments, ARP-1 downregulated the apoAI gene. The involvement of ARP-1 in the regulation of apoAI gene expression suggests that it may participate in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis.\r"

AA produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of 86Rb uptake--an effect that was prevented by selective blockade of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Inhibition by cytochrome P450 blockade of the effect of AA on 86Rb uptake could be circumvented by addition of the principal products of AA metabolism in the mTALH.\r"

The alpha subunit of a newly discovered pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein (Gq) has recently been isolated and is now shown to stimulate the activity of polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from bovine brain. Both the maximal activity and the affinity of PI-PLC for calcium ion were affected. These results identify Gq as a G protein that regulates PI-PLC.\r"

Clinical studies have shown it to be as effective as the standard antidepressant drugs currently used in the treatment of major depression. It is useful in patients resistant to other agents as well as in patients with atypical depression. Bupropion is 10 to 100 times less likely to induce cardiac conduction problems than the tricyclic drugs, and orthostatic hypotension is rare. Minimal anticholinergic effects account for its being generally well tolerated. The most common side effect is dry mouth. An epileptogenic potential is prominently reported. Because it may lower the convulsive threshold, bupropion is not recommended for individuals who may be predisposed to seizures. In people without an increased ictal risk factor, and when dosage is maintained at 450 mg/day or less in a divided schedule, the seizure rate is comparable to that of other antidepressant drugs.\r"

  ".W": "We describe eight patients who had terminal lung cancer causing severe dyspnea unrelieved by oxygen, nonnarcotic drugs, or intermittent bolus narcotics. We treated these patients with continuous intravenous infusion of morphine, beginning with bolus IV injections of 1 or 2 mg of morphine every 5 to 10 minutes until the patient reported relief. A continuous morphine infusion was then started, with the hourly dose equal to 50% of the cumulative bolus dose. Vital signs, degree of sedation, and blood gases were serially followed. Six patients achieved good dyspnea relief, one had moderate relief, and one had a poor response. Variable changes were noted in the PaO2, whereas PaCO2 steadily increased in five of seven patients, and pH decreased in six. There was little change in systolic blood pressure or pulse, and only one individual had less than 10 respirations per minute. The major side effect of treatment was sedation, treated by temporarily discontinuing morphine until the patients' mental status improved and then restarting the infusion at a 50% lower hourly morphine dose. Mean time of study was 30 hours (range 16 to 87 hours). Seven of the eight study patients died during treatment. Whether morphine therapy shortened survival is uncertain. We conclude that continuous morphine infusion is effective therapy for severe dyspnea. The treatment is ethically justified. Relief of suffering is the primary goal of therapy, and less risky treatments are unavailable.\r"

Currently, there is confusion in the literature regarding appropriate treatment of patients known to possess these antibodies. We have reported the case of a patient at 29 weeks' gestation who had elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, and early intrauterine growth retardation. Studies were positive for the presence of both lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. After delivery, chest pain and a pleural effusion developed as further manifestations of the patient's autoimmune disease.\r"

Diabetes developed in 75%, 15%, and 0% of the three groups. Animals protected from diabetes by FK 506, and killed in the nondiabetic state at 120 days had normal intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, virtual absence histopathologically of autoimmune insulitis, normal pancreatic insulin content, and immunocytochemical confirmation of islet insulin and glucagon content. Forty five to 75 days after stopping FK 506, about 3/4 of the animals who were diabetes free at 120 days have remained so. These results provide support for a clinical trial of FK 506 for recent onset diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "The thromboxane-receptor antagonist, SQ 30,741, may be used as adjuvant therapy for thrombolysis and has also been shown to have antiischemic activity that is independent of its thrombolytic activity. Since tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and SQ 30,741 may be administered simultaneously, we determined whether the antiischemic effects of SQ 30,741 can be potentiated by t-PA. This was accomplished by combining doses of t-PA and SQ 30,741, which alone were not cardioprotective. Anesthetized dogs were subjected to left circumflex coronary artery occlusion for 90 minutes and reperfusion for 5 hours. The dogs were treated during reperfusion with a dose of t-PA that caused approximately a 30% reduction in plasma fibrinogen alone or in combination with 1.5 mg/kg + 0.4 mg/kg/hr SQ 30,741, which started 10 minutes after initiation of ischemia. At these doses, neither t-PA nor SQ 30,741 alone significantly reduced infarct size (57% +/- 6%, 50% +/- 10%, 57% +/- 6% of the left ventricular area at risk for vehicle controls, t-PA, and SQ 30,741 respectively); however, combination treatment resulted in a significant reduction in infarct size (37% +/- 5% of the left ventricular area at risk). Higher doses of t-PA and SQ 30,741 alone significantly reduced infarct size. The protective effects of t-PA and SQ 30,741 occurred without altering peripheral hemodynamic status. No differences in collateral or reperfusion blood flow were observed between groups. Thus although SQ 30,741 may act to improve the efficacy of thrombolysis, t-PA may in turn enhance the antiischemic activity of SQ 30,741 or at least reduce the threshold dose.\r"

Recombinant t-PA has played a vital role in the treatment of MI, restoring coronary arterial patency, limiting infarct size, preserving ventricular function, and improving patient survival. It has been shown to be safe when given to carefully selected patients and, although indications for clinical use have been relatively restricted, they appear to be expanding considerably. Future investigations must continue to focus on patient selection to allow treatment for all patients who would derive benefit and to establish dosing regimens and adjuvant therapies that will maximize coronary reperfusion while concomitantly limiting reocclusion and hemorrhagic complications.\r"

The clinical course of 373 patients--50 (13%) of whom developed complete AV block--admitted with inferior wall AMI and given thrombolytic therapy within 6 hours of symptom onset was studied. Acute patency rates of the infarct artery after thrombolytic therapy were similar in patients with or without AV block. Ventricular function measured at baseline and before discharge in patients with complete AV block showed a decrement in median ejection fraction (-3.5 vs -0.4%, p = 0.03) and in median regional wall motion (-0.14 vs +0.24 standard deviations/chord, p = 0.05). The reocclusion rate was higher in patients with complete AV block (29 vs 16%, p = 0.03). Patients with complete AV block had more episodes of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (36 vs 14%, p less than 0.001), sustained hypotension (36 vs 10%, p less than 0.001), pulmonary edema (12 vs 4%, p = 0.02) and a higher in-hospital mortality rate (20 vs 4%, p less than 0.001), although the mortality rate after hospital discharge was identical (2%) in the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that complete AV block was a strong independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (p = 0.0006). Thus, despite initial successful reperfusion, patients with inferior wall AMI and complete AV block have higher rates of in-hospital complications and mortality.\r"

We confirmed this association in five of seven Italian MERRF pedigrees. The mutation was specific for the MERRF trait, because it was never found in mtDNA of non-MERRF individuals, including 14 normal and 110 diseased controls. Our study corroborates the idea that the A----G(8344) mutation is the most frequent and widespread genetic cause of MERRF.\r"

Sustained-action theophylline (250 mg three times or four times a day) or placebo was administered for 2 days, and the alternate drug was administered on the following 2 days. Sleep studies were performed on Nights 2 and 4 with spirometry at 9:00P.M. and 7:00A.M. Two puffs of metaproterenol or albuterol were administered at 10:00P.M. on both study nights. A theophylline level, drawn at bedtime (10:00 to 11:00P.M.), was 14.2 +/- 0.78 micrograms/ml on the theophylline nights and less than 2 on placebo nights. The morning FEV1 was significantly better during theophylline administration (1.27 +/- 0.12 versus 1.00 +/- 0.11 L, p less than 0.001). The mean arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2) were also better during NREM sleep on theophylline nights. Neither the mean SaO2 and transcutaneous PCO2 during REM sleep nor the apnea plus hypopnea index (events per hour of sleep) differed between placebo and theophylline nights. Theophylline administration did not impair the amount or architecture of sleep as neither total sleep time nor the fraction of time spent in Stages 1, 2, and 3/4 and REM differed between the two regimens. The number of arousals per hour of sleep was slightly less on theophylline nights (19.9 +/- 1.7 versus 24.9 +/- 2.7, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because glycosaminoglycans and particularly hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HA), may play an important role in the extracellular matrix response to early injury and subsequent fibrosis, this study was undertaken to define the early time course of changes in HA and hyaluronidase. Hamsters were given either 1 unit bleomycin sulfate in 0.2 ml saline or 0.2 ml saline (control), and randomly selected animals from both groups were killed at Days 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 17. Glycosaminoglycan fractions prepared from lung tissue of individual animals were analyzed for HA. The maximal HA content was reached 6 days after instillation of bleomycin and was 14.6-fold the normal value. The weight of injured lungs was 2.3-fold the control value. Thus, the increase in HA content was 30-fold. By Day 7 the HA content had dropped sharply. It then declined gradually to approximately double control values at Day 17. The specific activity of lysosomal hyaluronidase was the same in bleomycin-treated lungs and control lungs. Total units of the enzyme were increased in injured lungs, even at the time of maximal HA content, indicating active turnover of HA. The maximal HA content occurs prior to the rise in collagen and elastin biosynthesis. This observation in addition to the magnitude of the increase and its abrupt decline suggest that HA may be an important initiating factor for pathologic changes in lung extracellular matrix components.\r"

Increasingly, however, isolated motor-tract involvement has been reported. A new technique, magnetic coil stimulation of the cortex, directly monitors the motor tracts.

To test the effects of thrombolysis on the incidence and evolution of late potentials, 158 consecutive patients were prospectively studied during the first 10 days after acute myocardial infarction. The study population consisted of two groups: 93 control patients treated conservatively and 65 patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Recordings of signal averaged electrocardiogram were obtained within two days and 7-10 days after infarction. The incidence of late potentials in the first two days after infarction was not significantly different in the thrombolytic and control groups (14% v 11.8%). By 7-10 days the incidence of late potentials among patients who underwent thrombolysis remained unchanged (14%); however, it increased significantly in the control group (11.8% to 22.5%). Thus thrombolysis seems to reduce the evolution of late potentials within 10 days of infarction. Because the risk of fatal arrhythmias is higher in patients with late potentials this study may partly explain the reduced mortality after thrombolysis.\r"

The ventilatory response to exercise was assessed by calculation of the slope of the relation between minute ventilation and rate of carbon dioxide production. There was a close correlation between the severity of heart failure, determined as the maximal rate of oxygen consumption, and the ventilatory response to exercise. Reanalysis of the data after correction for ventilation of anatomical dead space did not significantly weaken the correlation but reduced the slope of the relation by approximately one third. These results show that the increased ventilatory response to exercise in patients with chronic heart failure is largely caused by mechanisms other than increased ventilation of anatomical dead space. This finding supports the concept that a significant pulmonary ventilation/perfusion mismatch develops in patients with chronic heart failure and suggests that the magnitude of this abnormality is directly related to the severity of chronic heart failure.\r"

  ".U": "91120635\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To reexamine the mortality experience of a cohort of long-term users of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in comparison with that reported previously for the same cohort of women, paying particular attention to cardiovascular mortality, deaths from breast and endometrial cancer, and deaths attributed to suicide or suspected suicide. DESIGN--Longitudinal cohort of 4544 long-term users of HRT amongst whom mortality is being monitored prospectively in comparison with expected rates in the female population of England and Wales (taking account of age and calendar period). SUBJECTS--4544 women, all of whom were recruited from specialist menopause clinics around Britain and had taken at least one year's continuous HRT at the time of recruitment to the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, deaths from female cancers, deaths attributed to suicide or suspected suicide. RESULTS--Overall mortality (based on 236 deaths over the entire study period from recruitment to December 1988) remained significantly lower than expected on the basis of national rates (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence limits (CL) 0.47-0.66). When specific causes were considered, the only mortality ratios greater than unity were for injury, poisoning and violence (1.54, 95% CL 1.02-2.06), and for suicide and suspected suicide ('suicide') (2.40, 95% CL 1.68-3.11). Comparison of the ratios for the 112 additional deaths with those obtained in our previous analysis revealed that one of the few ratios to show any increase was that for breast cancer mortality. This rose from a significant deficit of 0.55 (95% CL 0.28-0.96) in the earlier period to 1.00 (95% CL 0.55-1.45) in the later period. There was also a suggestion of an increase in breast cancer risk with increasing duration since first use of HRT. Most of the other cause-specific ratios were very similar over the two periods. The ratio of death from all circulatory diseases was notably lower in the later analysis (RR 0.37, 95% CL 0.15-0.58) than in the earlier analysis (0.51, 95% CL 0.36-0.69), as were all of the subcategories of cardiovascular death. The mortality ratio for cancer of the ovary and uterine adnexa fell from 1.12 in the previous analysis to 0.63 (95% CL 0-1.41). The mortality ratio for 'suicide' also decreased, but was only slightly lower in the later period. As before, however, there was evidence of a relatively high prevalence of prior psychiatric problems amongst the recent 'suicide' deaths, suggesting that the excess of deaths from 'suicide' may be a manifestation of selection. CONCLUSION--These data are consistent with a beneficial effect of HRT on cardiovascular diseases, although updated information comparing progestogen-opposed and -unopposed treatment is not available. The increase in breast cancer mortality contrasts with the pattern for all other specific causes examined; taken together with the suggestion of an increase in breast cancer mortality with increasing interval since first exposure to HRT, this finding is somewhat worrying.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study the effect of long-term continuous combined oestrogen/progestogen therapy on calcium metabolism, lipoproteins, and bleeding pattern in early postmenopausal women. DESIGN--A prospective, open, controlled study. After initial examinations, control examinations were performed every three months for the first two years and every year for the following three (two) years, with determinations of bone mass, serum lipoproteins, and bleeding pattern. SETTING--Out-patient research clinic at The Department of Clinical Chemistry, Glostrup Hospital, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS--Eighteen healthy women between 6 months and 3 years after a natural menopause, entered in a trial of continuous long-term hormone replacement therapy and a comparison group of 19 age-matched untreated women. INTERVENTION--The treated group received 2 mg of 17 beta-oestradiol combined with 1 mg of norethisterone acetate orally each day continuously for 5 years with a 3 month therapy-free interval after the first 2 years. The women were investigated before treatment, then every 3 months for the first 2 years and every year for the next 3 years for determinations of bone mass, serum lipoproteins and bleeding patterns. The comparison group was followed-up in parallel for the first 4 years. Forearm bone mass was measured with single photon absorptiometry. Blood and urine samples were taken in the morning after an overnight fast and tobacco abstinence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The effects of hormone therapy on bone mineral content in the forearm, on serum and urine indices of calcium metabolism, on serum levels of total, high (HDL-C) and low (LDL-C) density lipoprotein cholesterol, and bleeding pattern. RESULTS--Bone mineral content in the forearm was stable during the 5 years of treatment, whereas it declined significantly averaging 10% after 4 years in the comparison group. The biochemical estimates of bone turnover decreased to premenopausal level in the hormone group, whereas they remained at a high level in the comparison group. In the hormone group total cholesterol and LDL-C decreased by 20% whereas HDL-C was virtually unchanged. The treatment was associated with minor irregular bleeding in nine women during the first 6 months of treatment, after which no bleeding was experienced. CONCLUSION--Continuous combined oestrogen/progestogen therapy can keep early postmenopausal women free of bleeding episodes for a period of 5 years, after the first 6 months in which spotting occurs in 25%. The therapy prevented bone loss completely. The changes in serum lipoproteins were concordant with a lipid profile associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease.\r"

  ".U": "91120949\r", 
  ".W": "Human progenitor-derived erythroblasts have been recently shown to respond to erythropoietin (Epo) with an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration [Cac]. To explore the role of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins in mediating the rise in [Cac], single day 10 erythroid burst forming unit (BFU-E)-derived erythroblasts loaded with Fura-2 were pretreated with pertussis toxin (PT), stimulated with Epo, and [Cac] measured over 18 minutes with fluorescence microscopy coupled to digital video imaging. The [Cac] increase in day 10 erythroblasts stimulated with Epo was blocked by pretreatment with PT in a dose-dependent manner but not by heat-inactivated PT. These observations provided strong evidence that a PT-sensitive GTP-binding protein is involved. To further characterize the GTP-binding protein, day 10 erythroblast membrane preparations were solubilized, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for the known PT-sensitive G-protein subunits: the three subtypes of Gia (1,2, and 3) and Goa, Gia1 or Gia3 and Gia2 were identified but no Goa was found. To examine the influence of Epo on adenylate cyclase activity, day 10 erythroblasts were initially treated with Epo, isolated membrane preparations made, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production by adenylate cyclase in membrane preparations in the presence of theophylline measured. Epo did not inhibit but significantly stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. However, the mechanism of increase of [Cac] appears to be independent of adenylate cyclase stimulation because treatment of erythroblasts with the cell-permeant dibutyryl cAMP failed to increase [Cac]. In summary, pertussis toxin blocks the increase in [Cac] in erythroblasts after Epo stimulation suggesting that this response is mediated through a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. Candidate PT-sensitive GTP-binding proteins identified on day 10 erythroblasts were Gia 1, 2, or 3, but not Goa.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicated a correlation between the formation of EDTA-resistant (irreversible) platelet-fibrinogen interactions and platelet cytoskeleton formation. The present study explored the direct association of membrane-bound fibrinogen with the Triton X-100 (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO) insoluble cytoskeleton of aspirin-treated, gel-filtered platelets, activated but not aggregated with 20 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or 150 mU/mL human thrombin (THR) when bound fibrinogen had become resistant to dissociation by EDTA. Conversion of exogenous 125I-fibrinogen to fibrin was prevented by adding Gly-Pro-Arg and neutralizing THR with hirudin before initiating binding studies. After 60 minutes at 22 degrees C, the cytoskeleton of ADP-treated platelets contained 20% +/- 12% (mean +/- SD, n = 14) of membrane-bound 125I-fibrinogen, representing 10% to 50% of EDTA-resistant fibrinogen binding. The THR-activated cytoskeleton contained 45% +/- 15% of platelet bound fibrinogen, comprising 80% to 100% of EDTA-resistant fibrinogen binding. 125I-fibrinogen was not recovered with platelet cytoskeletons if binding was inhibited by the RGDS peptide, excess unlabeled fibrinogen, or disruption of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex by EDTA-treatment. Both development of EDTA-resistant fibrinogen binding and fibrinogen association with the cytoskeleton were time dependent and reached maxima 45 to 60 minutes after fibrinogen binding to stimulated platelets. Although a larger cytoskeleton formed after platelet stimulation with thrombin as compared with ADP, no change in cytoskeleton composition was noted with development of EDTA-resistant fibrinogen binding. Examination of platelet cytoskeletons using monoclonal antibodies, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting showed the presence of only traces of GP IIb-IIIa in the cytoskeletons of resting platelets, with no detectable increases after platelet activation or development of EDTA-resistant fibrinogen binding. These data suggest that GP IIb-IIIa-mediated fibrinogen binding to activated platelets is accompanied by time-dependent alterations in platelet-fibrinogen interactions leading to the GP IIb-IIIa independent association between bound fibrinogen and the platelet cytoskeleton.\r"

Deficiencies or abnormalities of the coagulation system, of platelet function, or of factor XIII and alpha-2-antiplasmin were excluded. Consistently, however, over a period of 7 years, a high basal euglobulin fibrinolytic activity was observed that was characterized by a high tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, normal t-PA antigen, and undetectable plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity. The high specific activity of t-PA (640,000 IU/mg) and the minimal amounts of t-PA/PAI-1 complexes detected by fibrin zymography suggest that in this patient all t-PA was active. This is in striking contrast to normal plasma, where the majority of t-PA is complexed to PAI-1. Thus, in this patient, a severe deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with a delayed type bleeding tendency. Our observation underscores the importance of plasma PAI-1 for the stabilization of the hemostatic plug.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to enhance the fibrinolytic activity of endothelial cells (EC), a retroviral vector containing the human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) cDNA was constructed. Sheep EC were stably transduced with the vector, resulting in a 30-fold increase in t-PA activity over that detected in EC transduced with a control vector. Southern and Northern analyses confirmed the presence of both the vector sequence and the appropriate mRNA transcripts. Secretion of high levels of recombinant human t-PA continued in vitro for the duration of the experiments, up to 11 weeks after transduction, although the rate of t-PA secretion decreased in some of the EC lines. Zymographic analysis of conditioned medium from t-PA-transduced EC showed the presence of two new molecular species with plasminogen activator activity that could be specifically immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antihuman t-PA antibody. The relative molecular masses of these species (60 to 80 and 110 Kd) suggest that they represent recombinant human t-PA both free and bound to sheep plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Consistent with this interpretation, the 110-Kd species could be specifically immunoprecipitated with antiserum to PAI-1. These studies demonstrate that retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer may be used to increase total EC fibrinolytic activity.\r"

Granulocyte-CSF was inactive. The increases in BMM u-PA activity were inhibited by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone, and by agents that raise intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, including prostaglandin E2 and cholera toxin. These changes in u-PA activity were paralleled by corresponding changes in u-PA mRNA levels. Evidence was obtained for protein kinase C and phospholipase C-mediated stimulation of BMM u-PA activity and mRNA levels; however, no evidence was found for an involvement of Na+/H+ exchange or Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity, Ca2+ fluxes, or pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Several findings point to a dissociation between macrophage u-PA expression and DNA synthesis.\r"

SETTING--Two haemophilia centres in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS--88 Haemophiliac patients infected with HIV-I for whom sera were available from before seroconversion and in whom clinical follow up data were available. RESULTS--Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significant difference between a high titre (greater than 1600) p24 antibody response at seroconversion and prolonged time before the development of HIV related disease (p = 0.0008). In contrast, higher titres of antibody to gp120 at seroconversion (greater than 25,600) correlated with more rapid clinical deterioration (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS--The first humoral response to HIV proteins at seroconversion is associated with clinical outcome; patients with an initial low titre antibody response to the gagp24 protein have a significantly faster rate of progression to CDC stage IV disease. Patients with a high titre p24 antibody response progress to AIDS more slowly, and these data provide an explanation why p24 antigenaemia is not universally detected in patients with AIDS. It is unclear whether the association between a strong initial p24 antibody response and slower progression of HIV disease is causal and if so whether it is due to viral or host factors.\r"

At baseline, 21 patients had a creatinine clearance below 80 ml/min/1.73 m2. The two treatment phases (with either misoprostol, 600 micrograms daily, or matching placebo tablets) were separated by a washout phase in which diclofenac (150 mg daily) was continued. After treatment with misoprostol/diclofenac the glomerular filtration rate was 72 +/- 5 ml/min (mean +/- standard error), and the effective renal plasma flow was 295 +/- 21 ml/min. After treatment with placebo/diclofenac, the corresponding values were 71 +/- 5 ml/min and 296 +/- 21 ml/min, respectively. We concluded that misoprostol has no effect on the renal function of RA patients treated with diclofenac.\r"

The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with Mesna. Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d. Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d. There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria. At 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion (1), nausea (1), and Grade 2 leukopenia (1). The recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion. Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial. The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria. The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to $890 per cycle. Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained.\r"

Patients with underlying chronic hemolytic anemia or preexisting gallstones were excluded. Nine female and seven male patients with a median age of 12.4 years (range, 1.2 to 22.8 years) at diagnosis of primary cancer had gallstones develop 3 months to 17.3 years (median, 3.1 years) after therapy was initiated. Cumulative risks of 0.42% at 10 years and 1.03% at 18 years after diagnosis substantially exceed those reported for the general population of this age group. Treatment-related factors significantly associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis were ileal conduit, parenteral nutrition, abdominal surgery, and abdominal radiation therapy (relative risks and 95% confidence intervals = 61.6 [27.9-135.9], 23.0 [9.8-54.1], 15.1 [7.1-32.2], and 7.4 [3.2-17.0], respectively). There was no correlation with the type of cancer, nor was the frequency of conventional predisposing features (e.g., family history, obesity, use of oral contraceptives, and pregnancy) any higher among the affected patients in this study than in the general population. Patients with cancer who have risk factors identified here should be monitored for the development of gallstones.\r"

  ".W": "A two-part experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that myocardial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, as measured by coronary venous oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, determine coronary blood flow during increases in myocardial oxygen consumption. The left main coronary artery was pump-perfused at constant pressure in closed-chest, anesthetized dogs. Oxygenators in the perfusion circuit permitted control of coronary arterial gas tensions. The steady-state relation between coronary venous oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions and coronary flow at a constant myocardial oxygen consumption was determined by locally altering coronary arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions. Values of coronary venous oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions and coronary flow were also obtained at normal coronary arterial gas tensions during pacing-induced increases in myocardial oxygen consumption. The data yielded a hyperbolic relation among coronary venous oxygen and carbon dioxide tension and coronary flow during constant myocardial metabolism, suggesting a synergistic interaction between myocardial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in determining coronary flow. This relation was then used to predict the coronary flow change during pacing-induced increases in myocardial metabolism. Approximately 40% of the flow response during pacing-induced increases in myocardial oxygen consumption was predicted. In conclusion, coronary venous oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions synergistically interact to produce steady-state changes in coronary flow at a constant myocardial oxygen consumption. Changes in myocardial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions can account for about 40% of the change in coronary flow during moderate changes in myocardial oxygen consumption.\r"

  ".W": "In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Phase II trial, patients received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and were randomized to either a conservative or an invasive strategy. Within this study, the effects of immediate versus deferred beta-blocker therapy were also assessed in patients eligible for beta-blocker therapy, a group of 1,434 patients of which 720 were randomized to the immediate intravenous group and 714 to the deferred group. In the immediate intravenous group, within 2 hours of initiating rt-PA metoprolol was given (5 mg intravenously at 2-minute intervals over 6 minutes, for a total intravenous dose of 15 mg, followed by 50 mg orally every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and 100 mg orally every 12 hours thereafter). The patients assigned to the deferred group received metoprolol, 50 mg orally twice on day 6, followed by 100 mg orally twice a day thereafter. The therapy was tolerated well in both groups and the primary end point, resting global ejection fraction at hospital discharge, averaged 50.5% and was virtually identical in the two groups. The regional ventricular function was also similar in the two groups. Overall, there was no difference in mortality between the immediate intravenous and deferred groups, but in the subgroup defined as low risk there were no deaths at 6 weeks among those receiving immediate beta-blocker therapy in contrast to seven deaths among those in whom beta-blocker therapy was deferred. These findings for a secondary end point in a subgroup were not considered sufficient to warrant a recommendation regarding clinical use. There was a lower incidence of reinfarction (2.7% versus 5.1%, p = 0.02) and recurrent chest pain (18.8% versus 24.1%, p less than 0.02) at 6 days in the immediate intravenous group. Thus, in appropriate postinfarction patients, beta-blockers are safe when given early after thrombolytic therapy and are associated with decreased myocardial ischemia and reinfarction in the first week but offer no benefit over late administration in improving ventricular function or reducing mortality.\r"

Adverse neurological events occurred in 23 patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (2.5%) [nine cerebral infarctions (1.0%), 12 intracerebral hemorrhages (1.3%), and two subdural hematomas (0.2%)] and in 33 patients treated with 100 mg rt-PA (1.1%) [20 cerebral infarctions (0.7%), 11 intracerebral hemorrhages (0.4%), and two subdural hematomas (0.1%)]. The difference in adverse neurological events observed comparing the two rt-PA regimens was primarily due to a higher frequency of intracerebral bleeding among patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (1.3% versus 0.4%, p less than 0.01). Patients with recent (within 6 months) histories of stroke were not eligible for the study, and patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease were declared ineligible early in the study. The small number of patients (89, or 2.3%) with any history of neurological disease, intermittent cerebral ischemic attacks, or stroke who were enrolled before the stricter eligibility criteria were imposed or on the basis of incomplete baseline information experienced an increased frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage compared with patients without such histories (3.4% versus 0.5%). Mortality at 6 weeks after presentation among 23 patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage was 47.8%. Intracerebral hemorrhage is a severe but infrequent complication of rt-PA therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The combined frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral infarction after treatment with 100 mg rt-PA is comparable to that observed in other trials with thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

The validity of coronary sinus blood sampling was verified by simultaneous measurement of the ANF level. The plasma endothelin-1 levels in venous and coronary sinus blood of the spasm-provoked patients (n = 12) were 1.71-fold and 2.16-fold higher, respectively, than those of nonprovoked cases (n = 5, p less than 0.01). During left coronary spasm, the endothelin-1 level in coronary sinus transiently decreased from 2.27 +/- 0.14 to 1.76 +/- 0.14 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) and returned to the control level (1.98 +/- 0.20 pg/ml) after the spasm resolved, whereas the change was equivocal during right coronary spasm. In contrast, the patients in whom spasm was not provoked showed no changes and maintained low endothelin-1 levels both before and after the maximal provocation (0.90 +/- 0.13 versus 0.90 +/- 0.13 pg/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because their autocrine and paracrine effects are not fully understood, expression of such growth factor genes in specific cell types in vivo would help to determine their mechanism of action. We describe a method to transfer vascular smooth muscle cells expressing recombinant gene products to localized segments of the arterial wall. Vascular smooth muscle cells from the inbred Yucatan minipig were infected in vitro with an amphotropic, replication-defective retrovirus transducing the gene for Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. Vascular smooth muscle cells expressing this recombinant gene were implanted, using a catheter, into denuded iliofemoral artery segments of pigs in vivo. These arteries subsequently demonstrated beta-galactosidase activity in cells of the intima and media. This method, which provides for the introduction of genetically modified smooth muscle cells, can be used to define the biological effects of recombinant genes in the vessel wall and potentially to provide alternative treatments of vascular diseases.\r"

These techniques have been applied for screening asymptomatic individuals, diagnosis of symptomatic patients, monitoring of interventional or surgical procedures, and follow-up of the natural history or the efficacy of medical, interventional, or surgical therapy of vascular disease.

Isolated perfused rat kidneys were used to study the effects of plasma fractions obtained by gel filtration from essential hypertensive patients (n = 40) and from normotensive subjects (n = 36) on resistance vessels. Perfusion pressure was recorded at a constant flow. 2. Plasma fractions were obtained by gel filtration and contained substances with a molecular mass in the range 1000-1500 Da. The plasma fractions from hypertensive patients used in this study had been shown to increase blood pressure after intravenous injection in rats. 3. In the isolated rat kidneys, the hypertensive fractions increased perfusion pressure by 20 +/- 17 mmHg (mean +/- SD, range 5-58 mmHg, n = 40). The analogous fractions from normotensive subjects did not change perfusion pressure significantly. 4. In Ca2(+)-free medium containing 2 mmol/l ethyleneglycol bis-(aminoethyl ether)tetra-acetate, the change in perfusion pressure induced by active plasma fractions was reduced by 95.2 +/- 6.3%. Addition of nifedipine to the perfusion medium reduced, but did not abolish, the pressure response of the kidneys. 5. In solutions containing phentolamine or saralasin, vasoconstriction was not reduced. 6. Thus in the active fractions from hypertensive plasma, a vasopressor agent with direct action on resistance vessels can be demonstrated. This substance probably acts by increasing Ca2+ influx in vascular smooth muscle cells.\r"

Dichloroacetate, a stimulator of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, might offer an alternative treatment. The present study therefore examines the metabolic and haemodynamic effects of dichloroacetate and sodium bicarbonate in healthy volunteers. 2. On 2 different days, sodium dichloroacetate (50 mg/kg body weight) or sodium bicarbonate (1.5 mmol/kg body weight) was given intravenously as a single bolus in 10 healthy volunteers. Haemodynamic parameters were measured using a microprocessor-controlled system. Measurements were performed before and 30 and 60 min after infusion. 3. After administration of dichloroacetate, cardiac index increased from 2.3 +/- 0.03 to 2.7 +/- 0.1 1 min-1 m-2 (P less than 0.05), peripheral vascular resistance decreased from 266 +/- 9.7 to 240 +/- 1.7 kPa s l-1 (2662 +/- 97 to 2398 +/- 169 dyn s cm-5, P less than 0.05), oxygen availability increased from 442 +/- 16 to 535 +/- 30 ml min-1 m-2 (P less than 0.05) and serum lactate concentration fell from 1.4 +/- 0.14 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmol/l (P less than 0.05). With infusion of sodium bicarbonate there were no significant effects on any of these variables. 4. Our results show that dichloroacetate administered intravenously reduces the serum lactate concentration. The main effects of dichloroacetate itself are on the haemodynamic variables. Dichloroacetate increases cardiac index and oxygen availability and decreases peripheral vascular resistance, whereas sodium bicarbonate has no effect on haemodynamic or metabolic parameters. These data give some further insights in the actions of dichloroacetate and support the use of dichloroacetate as alternative therapy in various forms of metabolic acidosis.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 405 drug-treated diabetic subjects aged 50-74 yr. In all three areas, glyburide comprised approximately 75% of the oral treatment. RESULTS: In accordance with sales, Gotland was found to be a heavy-use area, characterized by a high prevalence of insulin treatment (43%), combination therapy with sulfonylureas and biguanide (28%), and high prescribed daily doses (PDDs) of glyburide (15.5 +/- 0.8 mg) compared with other areas. In Skelleftea, 38% were on insulin, 4% were on combination therapy, and the PDD of glyburide was 7.1 +/- 0.6 mg. In Tierp, 27% were on insulin, 26% were on combination therapy, and the PDD of glyburide was 11.4 +/- 0.7 mg. In Gotland, both men and women had significantly lower HbA1c levels, regardless of treatment mode, and a tendency to be more overweight compared with the area with the least pharmacological intensity (Skelleftea). CONCLUSIONS: In the three diabetic populations, good metabolic control, defined as an HbA1c level of less than 7% and acceptable weight control (body mass index less than 27 for men and less than 25 for women), was achieved among only 16% in Gotland, 17% in Skelleftea, and 12% in Tierp.\r"

The relationship between cognitive functioning and epilepsy is complex, however, with widely differing degrees of intellectual impairment--ranging from minimal to severe and progressive--related to diverse types of epileptic seizures, syndromes, and etiological factors. Prolonged and frequently repeated seizures are typically associated with more severe effects on cognitive functioning, particularly if epilepsy is symptomatic, i.e., secondary to a demonstrable brain lesion. A combination of such factors may contribute to the mental deterioration seen in many children suffering from severe epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "Human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) superovulation combined with washed intrauterine insemination (IUI) has been advocated for the treatment of various forms of infertility when more traditional therapy has failed. To assess the relative efficacy of combined treatment with hMG and IUI compared with either hMG or IUI alone, pregnancy outcomes of the three treatment groups were compared in couples having infertility because of male factor, cervical factor, endometriosis, or unexplained. A total of 751 cycles were analyzed from 322 couples. The mean cycle fecundity rate associated with hMG/IUI therapy was significantly higher than either hMG or IUI therapy alone for all patients (hMG/IUI = 19.6%, hMG = 6.3%, IUI = 3.4%). The improvement in cycle fecundity rates with hMG/IUI therapy was also observed when the couples were separated by infertility diagnostic groups: male factor (hMG/IUI = 15.3%, hMG = 4.4%, IUI = 3.0%), cervical factor (hMG/IUI = 26.3%, hMG = 7.9%, IUI = 5.1%), endometriosis (hMG/IUI = 12.85%, hMG = 6.6%), and unexplained infertility (hMG/IUI = 32.6%, hMG = 5.5%, IUI = 0%). Moreover, in patients who had failed to conceive with hMG or IUI alone, the cycle fecundity rate when they were switched to hMG/IUI therapy equaled that of patients who received combined therapy from the onset. We conclude that cycle fecundity rates and cumulative pregnancy rates are significantly greater using a combination of hMG and IUI compared with either modality alone in the treatment of male factor, cervical factor, endometriosis, or unexplained infertility. Indeed, in couples with nontubal related infertility, cycle fecundity rates with hMG/IUI approach the rates seen with in vitro fertilization and gamete intrafallopian tube transfer.\r"

Two groups of 12 patients each were suppressed with GnRH-a and stimulation with a fixed dose of hMG. The control group (n = 10) received equal doses of hMG only. The follicular phase and the number of hMG ampules was significantly higher in the study group. Basal FSH levels and FSH levels during hMG treatment were significantly lower in patients treated with GnRH-a. Peak estradiol levels and the outcome of in vitro fertilization treatment were similar in the three groups. We suggest that the delay in ovarian response in patients treated with a combination of GnRH-a and hMG is because of lack of endogenous contribution of FSH, resulting in low circulating levels of FSH. An increase of serum FSH levels by administration of higher doses of hMG can reverse this effect.\r"

The gonadotropin response to subsequent gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH) administration was also studied. Eight women received 8-hour infusions of either Fenoldopam (0.5 microgram/kg per minute) (Smith Kline and French, Harrow, United Kingdom) or placebo. After 7 hours of infusion, GnRH was given intravenously. The luteinizing hormone (LH) response to GnRH was significantly higher during Fenoldopam compared with placebo (LH; 13.1 +/- 9.0 versus 9.4 +/- 4.3 IU/L). Basal LH levels, pulse amplitude, and pulse frequency during Fenoldopam infusion were not different from placebo. Prolactin levels increased significantly during Fenoldopam (24 +/- 2 micrograms/L) compared with placebo (16 +/- 2). The results suggest that D-1 receptor stimulation does not affect pulsatile gonadotropin secretion but increases the pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. Additionally, dopamine and Fenoldopam have opposite effects on PRL secretion, the latter increasing PRL levels.\r"

Women who received four or more oocytes were three times more likely to achieve a clinical pregnancy than those who received three or less. There was no statistically significant difference in pregnancy rates between patients who received five, six, seven, or eight oocytes.

Of 26 patients who had cycles during which no oocytes were retrieved, 10 were pregnant in the past and 20 had at least one other IVF cycle that yielded oocytes. There was no difference in the frequency of any stimulation protocol among the failure cycles compared with the successful ones. Hormonal response pattern and the number of large follicles observed sonographically did not differ between the two occasions. Fertilization occurred in 70% of the successful cycles and two biochemical pregnancies were recorded. In 13 patients, at least one cycle was canceled because of poor ovarian response, but 9 of these 13 had at least one other successful cycle. We conclude that the so-called empty follicle syndrome cannot be predicted by the pattern of ovarian response and does not predict a reduced fertility potential in future cycles.\r"

Basal levels of plasma T were reduced in the 1st 2-week-long period of hypoprolactinemia. In the 4-week-long period of hypoprolactinemia, the maximal response of plasma T to hCG stimulation was significantly reduced. The findings suggest that normal levels of plasma PRL may play an important role in the secretion of T in the human testes in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally assumed that the immunological activity of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) molecule, as reported in the radioimmunoassay (RIA), is identical to the molecule's biological activity. To test the validity of this assumption, the receptor-binding and immunological activities of FSH in the serum of 35 infertile males and 11 fertile males were determined by radioreceptor assay (RRA) and by the standard RIA. The results were analyzed in terms of the ratio of binding (RRA) to immunological (RIA) activity x 100%, referred to as the B/I%, for each patient based on data from the RRA and RIA, respectively. The B/I% for fertile men ranged from 44% to 113% (mean of 80%). In the group of 11 infertile men with normal FSH levels by RIA (50 to 300 ng/mL), there was no significant difference in B/I% (range of 27% to 99%, mean of 59%) from the fertile controls. However, a statistically significant decrease in B/I% (range of 7% to 35%, mean of 18%) was noted in the 24 hypergonadotropic infertile men with RIA levels of serum FSH greater than 300 ng/mL. These significant discrepancies between receptor-binding and immunological activities of serum FSH raise the question of whether RIAs alone are valid parameters for the endocrine evaluation of infertile men with elevated serum FSH levels.\r"

Eighteen immunobead test positive sera and 18 negative sera were used as the standard for the other two assays. Of the 18 positive sera, 14 (77%) and 5 (27%) were positive in the immunofluorescence assay and the radiolabeled antiglobulin assay, respectively. Four (22%) of the low titer immunobead test positive sera were negative by both the immunofluorescence assay and the radiolabeled antiglobulin assay. However, there was a significant positive correlation between the results of the immunofluorescence assay and the radiolabeled antiglobulin assay (r = 0.73) and between the results of the radiolabeled antiglobulin assay and the titer of the immunobead test (r = 0.82). The use of an unselected sperm population in the radiolabeled antiglobulin assay and the classical indirect immunofluorescence method using methanol-fixed sperm gave false-positive results in the radiolabeled antiglobulin assay and the immunofluorescence assay. These results suggested that immunoglobulin G antisperm antibody positive sera may be reactive both to sperm surface and internalized sperm antigens.\r"

CML may be formed by oxidation of fructoselysine (FL), the Amadori adduct formed on nonenzymatic glycosylation of lysine residues in protein, or by reaction of ascorbate with protein under autoxidizing conditions. We proposed that measurements of tissue and urinary CML may be useful as indices of oxidative stress or damage to proteins in vivo. To determine the extent to which oxidation of nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins contributes to urinary CML, we measured the urinary concentrations of FL and CML in diabetic (n = 26) and control (n = 28) patients. The urinary concentration of FL correlated strongly with HbA1 measurements and was significantly higher in diabetic compared with control samples (9.2 +/- 6.5 and 4.0 +/- 2.8 micrograms/mg creatinine, respectively; P less than 0.0001). There was also a strong correlation between the concentrations of CML and FL in both diabetic and control urine (r = 0.67, P less than 0.0001) but only a weakly significant increase in the CML concentration in diabetic compared with control urine (1.2 +/- 0.5 and 1.0 +/- 0.3 micrograms/mg creatinine, respectively; P = 0.05). The molar ratio of CML to FL was significantly lower in diabetic compared with control patients (0.25 +/- 0.12 and 0.43 +/- 0.16, respectively; P less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "myo-Inositol uptake by culture neuroblastoma cells at a concentration of myo-inositol less than 50 microM was largely Na+ dependent. Exposing neuroblastoma cells to media supplemented with increasing concentrations of myo-inositol resulted in an increase in myo-inositol accumulation and intracellular content, but myo-inositol incorporation into phospholipids was not increased. The data indicate that myo-inositol exists as separate pools in neuroblastoma cells, and one or more of these pools may contribute to phospholipid synthesis. Exposing neuroblastoma cells to an increased concentration of glucose caused a decrease in myo-inositol uptake by two separate mechanisms. Acute exposure of the cells to 30 mM glucose caused a myo-inositol concentration-dependent decrease in Na(+)-dependent myo-inositol uptake. We propose that the acute inhibition of myo-inositol uptake by glucose is likely due to a competitive type of inhibition. Chronic exposure of cells to media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose also caused decreases in myo-inositol uptake and incorporation into inositol phospholipids and intracellular myo-inositol content. This decrease in myo-inositol metabolism persisted at a higher concentration of external myo-inositol than the acute inhibition. Supplementing media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose with 250 microM myo-inositol restored myo-inositol metabolism and content. The inhibition of myo-inositol uptake by cells chronically exposed to increased concentrations of glucose or galactose was due to a noncompetitive type of inhibition that was blocked by the addition of sorbinil. Chronic exposure of neuroblastoma cells to media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose caused a decrease in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase transport activity and resting membrane potential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Autoimmune diabetes mellitus affects greater than 50% of diabetes-prone BB (DP BB) rats but less than 1% of diabetes-resistant BB (DR BB) rats. We report an outbreak of spontaneous diabetes among DR BB rats that coincided with serologic evidence of the onset of viral infection. This apparent link between a change in the environment and the expression of diabetes then led us to study the interaction of environmental exposure to viral pathogens in this disorder with virally seropositive and seronegative populations of BB rats and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), an interferon inducer known to accelerate diabetes onset in DP rats. We administered a cytotoxic anti-RT6 monoclonal antibody, poly I:C, or both to DR rats. Depletion of the RT6.1+T-lymphocyte population has previously been shown to induce diabetes and thyroiditis in DR rats. RT6 alone did not induce diabetes in seronegative DR rats, and poly I:C was only weakly effective, but nearly all animals given both reagents became diabetic. When given to seropositive DR rats, either reagent alone induced diabetes; when given to non-BB rats, neither agent was effective. Poly I:C also accelerated the onset of DP diabetes to a greater extent in seropositive than in seronegative rats. We conclude that expression of the genetic predisposition to diabetes present in all BB rats depends on cellular factors that include the presence or absence of regulatory (RT6+) T lymphocytes and modulatory environmental factors including exposure to viral pathogens.\r"

In contrast, the viral-antibody-free (VAF) environment did not alter the resistance of pre-VAF diabetes-resistant (DR) rats to spontaneous and RT6+ T-lymphocyte-depletion-induced diabetes. Pre-VAF and VAF rats have essentially the same lymphocyte subsets, and VAF-DP rats are susceptible to the adoptive transfer of diabetes and to the diabetes-accelerating effects of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid injections. These results suggest that the presence of environmental viral pathogens may act to inhibit effector cell function in lymphopenic DP rats while enhancing effector cell activity in nonlymphopenic DR rats.\r"

The cause of these explosions is ignition of gas containing hydrogen (greater than 4%) or methane (greater than 5%), and oxygen. Hydrogen and methane are products of colonic bacterial metabolism. Oral solutions used for colonoscopy preparation are designed to cleanse the colonic lumen but provide no substrate for fermentation reactions. In 52 patients undergoing colonoscopy, gas samples were collected from the right, transverse, and left colon and analyzed for hydrogen, methane, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. The highest hydrogen and methane concentrations were 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively, less than 16% of the explosive level. Oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were close to those of air, suggesting that the bulk of colonic gas was air infused during the procedure. We conclude that the concentrations of explosive gases are well below the hazardous levels when oral colonic cleansing solutions and standard colonoscopic procedures are employed.\r"

In normal subjects, therefore, the difference between the two markers may arise from bacterial break-down of lactulose but not of 51Cr-EDTA in the distal bowel, urinary excretion of lactulose representing small intestinal permeation and that of 51Cr-EDTA representing both small and large intestinal permeation. The markers were then given simultaneously to nine patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The 24 hour urinary recovery of 51Cr-EDTA in the patients was significantly greater than normal (4.64 (1.20) v 2.27 (0.15)% oral dose; p less than 0.01), but that of lactulose was not significantly affected. Moreover, the increase in 51Cr-EDTA recovery was most noticeable in the later urine collections. Both of these findings suggest that NSAIDs may increase colonic permeability.\r"

Levels of h-ANF were raised only in patients with evidence of severe renal impairment (serum creatinine greater than 300 mumol/l and urine output less than 100 ml/24 hours). h-ANF values were median 4.15, range 2-9 pmol/l and 10.1, 1-25 pmol/l for the control and severe renal impairment groups respectively (p less than 0.001). In the latter plasma renin activity was raised compared to that in control subjects (median 19.8, range 1.04-41.7 and 2.86, 1.87-5.9 pmol/l/h respectively, p less than 0.02). Plasma aldosterone concentration was also raised in patients (2176, 199-6894 pmol/l compared to 368, 133-578 pmol/l in control subjects, p less than 0.01). Haemodialysis induced changes in circulating h-ANF which correlated with volume and right atrial pressure changes (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05 respectively). In six patients with no or mild renal failure infusion of 900 ml 5% human albumin solution caused a significant increase in plasma h-ANF (p less than 0.05) without natriuresis or diuresis, a finding compatible with the hypothesis that there may be resistance to h-ANF in this group. The present findings indicate that there is no deficiency of h-ANF in fulminant hepatic failure and that known mechanisms of h-ANF release are not impaired.\r"
