The appearance of immunoglobulin-producing cells (plasma cells) in the inner ear structure was examined immunohistochemically in frozen sections. Four to 10 days following antigen challenge, 5 of the 20 animals showed significantly increased plasma cells in the subepithelial connective tissue of the endolymphatic sac (ES). Those cells showed positive reactions, mainly with IgG followed by IgM. The cells that reacted positively with IgA were few. Some of these plasma cells were considered to contain the specific antibody against HRP. The results indicate the role of the ES as a local immune response region for the inner ear complex, as well as the existence of an immunologic route from the middle ear cavity to the inner ear, particularly to the ES.\r"

The mean concentrations of albumin, immunoglobulin G, histamine, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were significantly greater in PL from ears with induced OME than in that from normal control ears. The 3H-PGE2 placed on the round window membrane of pathologically affected ears passed into PL in significantly greater amounts than in normal control ears. The findings indicate that the immune complexes placed in the middle ear cavity affect the biochemical milieu of PL, and that MEE is a result of immune complexes.\r"

The Km values for ATP obtained for the wild-type polymerase were similar to those reported previously. To further characterize the observed inhibition kinetics, in vitro transcription products synthesized in the presence or absence of RDP and RTP were purified by CsCl centrifugation and were primer extended with oligonucleotides specific for either positive-sense leader or nucleocapsid mRNA transcripts. The ratios of leader to nucleocapsid mRNA were measured from primer-extended in vitro transcription products. It was found that the addition of RDP or RTP did not significantly change the in vitro ratio, suggesting that the polymerase is blocked before it enters the 3' end of the template.\r"

The inhibitory activity was antagonized by proteinase K and beta-amylase and inactivated by heating at 80 degrees C for 30 min. The purified substance exhibited two typical absorption bands in the infrared spectrum at 1,650 and 1,075 cm-1, corresponding to peptide linkages and carbohydrate residues, respectively. These findings allowed us to characterize the antimicrobial compound as a thermolabile glycoprotein. The substance exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum, being active against clinical and environmental isolates from related and nonrelated taxonomical bacterial groups as well as against the producer strain and other similar marine bacterial strains. The inhibitory glycoprotein did not display cytotoxicity toward mammalian and fish cell lines.\r"

This loss of RNA correlated well with loss of viability and was not accompanied by solubilization of the cell wall or comparable losses of either protein or DNA. Simultaneous treatment with penicillin G and either chloramphenicol or rifampin resulted in reduced levels of killing and the complete inhibition of RNA loss. These findings define a new mechanism of penicillin G-induced killing in the absence of cell wall disruption and suggest a basis for drug-induced antagonism of penicillin G-mediated nonlytic death.\r"

ACV was administered topically (5%) or orally (5 mg/ml), while A1110U was applied topically (3%). In all but one experiment, the effect of combination therapy was greater than that calculated for the sum of the individual drug effects in limiting the development of herpetic skin lesions in mice. In several experiments, combination therapy totally eliminated all signs of infection. This synergistic chemotherapeutic efficacy was evident in infections caused by ACV-susceptible as well as several ACV-resistant HSV-1 strains. These results indicate that this combination therapy may provide a significant improvement in clinical responses over single-agent topical therapy.\r"

The antitumor agents VP-16 (demethylepipodophyllotoxin ethylio-beta-D-glucoside) and ellipticine demonstrated drug-enhanced topoisomerase II DNA cleavage (the concentration of drug that induced 50% of the maximal DNA cleavage in the test system [CC50]) at levels of less than or equal to 5 micrograms/ml. Nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, and oxolinic acid did not induce significant topoisomerase II DNA cleavage, whereas ciprofloxacin did induce some cleavage above background levels. CP-67,015, a new 6,8-difluoro-7-pyridyl 4-quinolone which possesses potent antibacterial activity, inhibited bacterial DNA gyrase at 0.125 micrograms/ml in a nonradioactive DNA cleavage assay. Unlike other quinolones characterized to date, CP-67,015 was shown to strongly enhance topoisomerase II-induced radiolabeled DNA cleavage with a CC50 of 33 micrograms/ml and demonstrated cleavage in a nonradiolabeled DNA cleavage assay with a CC50 of 73 micrograms/ml. The topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of DNA by CP-67,015 is consistent with its reported clastogenic effect on DNA in cell culture and its positive mutagenic response in mouse lymphoma cells. In vitro topoisomerase II catalytic and cleavage assays are useful for gaining preliminary information concerning the possible interaction(s) of some quinolones with eucaryotic topoisomerase II which may relate directly to their safety (mutagenicity, clastogenicity, or both) in human and veterinary medicinal usage.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between the chemical structure and epileptogenic activity of quinolones was investigated. When the quinolones were administered intravenously to mice concomitantly with oral biphenylacetic acid, a major metabolite of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug fenbufen, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and pipemidic acid, which have an unsubstituted piperazine moiety at the 7 position of their parent nuclei, provoked clonic convulsions and subsequent death at doses of 6.25 mg/kg or more in a dose-dependent manner. AM-1091 and T-3262, which have an unsubstituted aminopyrrolidine moiety at their 7 positions, were less epileptogenic than the compounds listed above were. In contrast, ofloxacin, AT-4140, and nalidixic acid, which have piperazine substituted with methyl group(s) or no piperazine moiety at their 7 positions, never induced convulsions, even at doses of 100 mg/kg. Lomefloxacin, which has a 3-methyl piperazine, however, provoked convulsions at doses of 6.25 mg/kg or more. In the presence of biphenylacetic acid, all the test quinolones except nalidixic acid competitively inhibited [3H]muscimol binding to receptor sites for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in vitro. Nalidixic acid did not inhibit the binding at all, even at the highest concentration tested, i.e., 10(-4) M. The 50% inhibition doses for [3H]muscimol binding varied within 4 orders of magnitude or more, between 10(-8) to more than 10(-4) M for various compounds, and there was a close correlation between the epileptogenic activities of quinolones and their inhibitory potencies for [3H]muscimol binding to GABA receptor sites. These results indicate that the epileptogenic activity of quinolones possibly relates to the GABA-like structures of substituents at their 7 positions, which act as antagonists of GABA receptors.\r"

Unactivated peritoneal macrophages were infected with the virulent RH strain of T. gondii and exposed to the 1,2,4-trioxanes at different concentrations. The antitoxoplasmic activity of the drugs was first assessed with [3H]uracil, which is incorporated by the parasite but not the host cell. Pentatroxane and thiahexatroxane were the most active, exhibiting 90% inhibitory concentrations of 6.8 and 5.3 micrograms/ml, respectively. Furthermore, microscopic examination of the infected macrophages after treatment with pentatroxane, thiahexatroxane, and hexatroxanone at their respective 90% inhibitory concentrations confirmed the inhibition of intracellular growth of T. gondii. Their activities were comparable to those of pyrimethamine (1 micrograms/ml) and pyrimethamine (0.1 micrograms/ml) in combination with sulfadiazine (25 micrograms/ml). Pentatroxane and thiahexatroxane were also able to inhibit intracellular growth of T. gondii within nonprofessional phagocytes (HeLa cells), suggesting that the antitoxoplasmic activity was not caused by a macrophage-specific mechanism, such as macrophage activation. However, the 1,2,4-trioxanes were not active against extracellular T. gondii. Pentatroxane and thiahexatroxane are new, promising compounds that deserve further study to assess their usefulness for treating toxoplasmosis.\r"

The in vivo absorption (dose, 0.2 mmol/kg) and the conversion to the active compound, penciclovir, were determined in rats. Compared with the sodium salt of penciclovir given intravenously, the bioavailabilities of penciclovir from orally administered penciclovir, BRL 42359, famciclovir, and BRL 43599 were 1.5, 9, 41, and 27%, respectively. These prodrugs and 6-deoxyacyclovir were tested for stability in rat duodenal contents and for metabolism in rat intestinal wall homogenate, liver homogenate, and blood and in the corresponding human fluids and tissues. Famciclovir was much more stable than BRL 43599 in human duodenal contents (half-lives, greater than 2 h and 7 min, respectively) yet was efficiently converted to penciclovir by the tissue homogenates. The major metabolic pathway was by deacetylation followed by oxidation at the 6 position. The rate of oxidation was comparable to that of 6-deoxyacyclovir, which is known to be converted efficiently to acyclovir in humans. Famciclovir was selected for further evaluation and progression to studies in humans. These subsequent studies confirmed that, after oral dosing with famciclovir, more than half the dose was absorbed and rapidly converted to penciclovir.\r"

In fact, after a sample or urine was filtered through an Acrodisc (0.45 micron pore size), radiochemical and microbiological data for the filtrate were very similar. Possible metabolites were looked for by high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the teicoplanin complex composition in the urine samples, with both UV and radioactivity detection. The quantitation, based on the 14C percentage in each peak, showed that no more than 3 to 5% of the [14C]teicoplanin underwent metabolic and/or chemical transformation.\r"

Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.\r"

Over the 7-day study, 12 adult male subjects received 12 administrations each of the capsule, solution, and syrup formulations every 4 h (six times daily) in a randomized sequence. Frequent blood samples were collected over the 4-h period after dose 12 was administered. Zidovudine concentrations in plasma were determined by a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay. Results from statistical analyses indicated that all three formulations were bioequivalent with respect to systemic availability (area under the time-concentration curve) and that the syrup was also equivalent to the solution with respect to the maximum peak concentration in serum. The lower relative maximum peak concentration in serum (approximately 81%) and small delays in time to peak concentration (less than 30 min) of the capsule formulation as compared with the liquid formulations are thought to be due to the additional processes of disintegration and dissolution associated with capsule administration. All three preparations were well tolerated during the 7-day study.\r"

A positive serologic test result was not suspected on clinical grounds in any of these patients. All were detected by routine screening. Of the 16 patients, 15 had charts available for review. Seven patients were treated for primary or late syphilis; four patients had received previous treatment; and four patients had no evaluation of test results and received no treatment. Routine screening of hospitalized patients who are alcohol or drug abusers is justified, but close follow-up is necessary to make screening meaningful.\r"

Calcipotriol and calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3) show similar receptor binding and comparable effects on cell differentiation. However, calcipotriol seems to be at least 100 times less potent in its effects on calcium metabolism. In a double-masked study involving 50 patients with psoriasis vulgaris, the efficacy and tolerability of ointments containing various calcipotriol concentrations (25, 50, or 100 micrograms/g) or the vehicle alone were compared in a study involving a right-left, within-patient randomized design. Patients were treated twice daily for 8 weeks. Marked improvement was seen in 40% of the patients treated with the 25-micrograms/g concentration of calcipotriol in 63% of patients treated with the 50-micrograms/g concentration, and in 88% treated with the 100-micrograms/g concentration. No patient treated with placebo had more than slight improvement. Five patients developed facial dermatitis during the study. The serum levels of ionized calcium were unchanged. This study demonstrates that calcipotriol ointment provides an effective and well-tolerated treatment of psoriasis vulgaris.\r"

The choice of a 48-hour measurement was validated by phototesting an additional 11 subjects to determine the time course of PUVA erythema. No correlation was demonstrated between minimal erythema dose for UVB, minimal phototoxic dose for PUVA, and sun-reactive skin type. The mean slope of the dose-response curve for UVB erythema was four times steeper than that for PUVA. Psoralen-UVA erythema reached a broad maximum between 48 and 96 hours after irradiation. Using objective methods we have demonstrated that the commonly accepted view of a steep dose-response relationship for PUVA erythema is not valid.\r"

A total of 315 isolates (162 anaerobes and 153 aerobes) were recovered. An average of 0.8 aerobic or facultative isolates per infected cyst were recovered, and this number was unrelated to the cysts' anatomic sites. However, the number of anaerobic bacteria varied; they were isolated more frequently in perirectal (1.5 isolates per specimen), vulvovaginal (1.4), and head (1.1) infections, and less frequently in trunk (0.7) and extremities (0.4) infections. The predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (81 isolates), group A streptococcus (9 isolates), and Escherichia coli (7 isolates). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Peptostreptococcus species (85 isolates) and Bacteroides species (55 isolates, including 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus and 9 Bacteroides fragilis groups).

This was first done using clinical data only, then using the combination of clinical and gross necropsy findings and finally using clinical, gross necropsy, histological and any other information (for example, chromosome analyses, microbiological investigations). Only 14 (6%) of deaths changed groups within the Wigglesworth classification when gross necropsy findings were considered as well as clinical findings, and altogether only 21 (9%) changed classification when complete investigations were available. There was an unacceptable amount (15%) of disagreement between the classifiers, largely the result of failure to comply with the rules laid down for classification. We set out amendments to Wigglesworth's original definitions to clarify certain ambiguities.\r"

Twelve of 22 babies born before 33 weeks' gestation excreted 2,3-butanediol, as did six born between 33 and 36 weeks. Six very immature babies also excreted acetoin, the metabolic precursor of the diol. Other products derived from carbohydrate included methylmalonic and ethylmalonic acids in one baby, and D-lactic acid in five. Acetoin has never been found in urine before, and the other four acids have been found only rarely. Excretion of these metabolites by preterm babies can be explained by increased intestinal permeability, unabsorbed lactose in the colon, and colonisation with certain opportunistic micro-organisms prevalent in neonatal units, including klebsiella, serratia, and enterobacter. The findings support evidence from breath hydrogen analysis that carbohydrate fermentation takes place in the gut of preterm infants.\r"

The blood flow velocity in the ascending aorta was measured by a range gated Doppler technique and multiplied by the cross sectional diameter measured by cross sectional and M mode echocardiography. Left ventricular output remained high in the first two hours, 235-243 ml/min/kg, despite a 10% decrease in heart rate. The fall in heart rate was compensated for by a 15% increase in stroke volume. Between 2 and 24 hours there was a significant fall in mean (SD) left ventricular output to 187 (35) ml/min/kg caused mainly by a reduction in stroke volume. The fall in left ventricle output after two hours may reflect an adaptation to the decreased demand on the left ventricle as the ductus constricts.\r"

Mean serum IgM concentration for Wilson-Mikity syndrome was 1.02 g/l whereas it was 0.14 g/l for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 0.32 g/l for unexplained chronic lung disease. The incidence of chorioamnionitis was significantly higher in Wilson-Mikity syndrome (30/35) compared with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (4/16) and with infants without chronic respiratory insufficiency (145/490).

  ".W": "To establish time trends in surgical rates for peptic ulcer disease, all surgical departments in Sweden were requested to complete a questionnaire regarding elective operations for gastric and duodenal ulcers and emergency operations for ulcer perforations performed in 1956, 1966, 1976, and 1986. A total of 8558 operations were reported for these years. The incidence of elective surgery declined steadily, the rates being 72.1, 45.0, 31.9, and 10.7 per 100,000 inhabitants. The male:female ratio fell from 4.2 to 1.5:1, while the duodenal/gastric ulcer ratio remained virtually unchanged. The operation rate for perforation decreased by 50%, from 12.8 to 6.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. We conclude that there has been a dramatic decline in elective peptic ulcer surgery in Sweden that began long before the advent of fiberoptic endoscopy, highly selective vagotomy, or H2-receptor antagonists. The comparable decline in emergency procedures suggests that true changes in the incidence or severity of the disease have occurred. In the future the few patients still needing elective surgery for peptic ulcer may have to be served by a small number of specialized centers.\r"

  ".W": "Recently a number of surgeons have recommended radical resection of gastrinomas in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). We have developed a useful technique for preoperative localization of gastrinomas--the selective arterial secretin injection test (SASI)--and we recommend an intraoperative secretin test (IOS) for deciding the radicality of resection of gastrinomas. Here the results of SASI and IOS tests in 11 patients with ZES are examined and compared with the results of other techniques. The SASI test localized gastrinomas in all of the patients, while the sensitivity of ultrasonography, computed tomography, arteriography, or portal venous blood samplings was between 1/11 and 5/11. On the basis of the results of the SASI test, radical resection of gastrinoma was performed in four patients (three pancreatoduodenectomies and one extirpation). After pancreatoduodenectomy, immunohistologic study of the specimen revealed multiple microgastrinomas and lymph node metastases in two patients and the coexistence of a microgastrinoma and a gastinoma in one patient. The IOS test was useful in the estimation of the advisability of radicality, and in two patients total gastrectomy was not performed because of the results of the IOS test. These four patients are well and have returned to work, and their serum gastrin levels are below 35 pg/mL. Thus we believe SASI and IOS tests are helpful for planning curative resection of gastrinomas.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term injection sclerotherapy after proved variceal bleeding was assessed in 245 patients. The majority had alcoholic cirrhosis and the patients were equally distributed between modified Pugh-Child's risk grades A, B, and C. Esophageal varices were eradicated in 88% of the 140 patients who survived long enough for analysis, and remained eradicated for a mean of 19.4 months. The incidence of recurrent variceal bleeding after the first hospital admission was 0.02 bleeding episodes per patient month of follow-up study and was markedly reduced after eradication of varices. The overall cumulative survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years were 54%, 39%, and 29%, respectively. The prognosis was influenced by the risk grade and the number of variceal bleeds before entering the study and to a lesser extent by the etiology of the cirrhosis. Fifty-two per cent of the patients died during the 10-year period. Liver failure was the major cause of death. Complications were mostly of a minor nature but they became cumulative with time. Minor complications included mucosal slough and injection-site leak, although the latter had an associated mortality risk. Significant esophageal stenosis and esophageal rupture were rare. As a result of this study a more radical surgical policy is proposed for sclerotherapy failures. These are defined as patients in whom varices are difficult to eradicate or who continue to have major variceal bleeds. Such patients should be subjected to either a portosystemic shunt or a devascularization and transection procedure.\r"

Eighteen lesions measuring 0.5 to 5.0 cm were confirmed histologically in the 11 cases. Histologically 10 of the 18 lesions were carcinomas in situ (ep cancer), and the other 8 lesions were carcinomas confined to the mucosa other than ep cancer (mm cancer); all 18 lesions were squamous cell carcinomas. Six (85.7%) of the seven mm cancers showed abnormal radiographic findings regardless of the size. Similarly these findings were noted on four of five (80%) ep carcinomas 2 cm or larger in size. All 15 lesions diagnosed before operation showed abnormal findings on conventional endoscopy regardless of the size and depth of transmural invasion. Morphologic change was observed in 9 lesions (53.3%), while 13 (86.7%) showed color change; most of the lesions (80%) were manifested as redness. Dyeing of the resected specimen with Lugol solution (Katayama Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) showed all 18 cancerous lesions as unstained areas. Among the 18 lesions, two lesions were unstained areas, which agreed with the areas determined histologically. An additional lesion was visible with dye endoscopy as an unstained area but it was not visible with radiography or conventional endoscopy. Dye endoscopy using Lugol solution is very important because it allows detection and evaluation of the extent of esophageal mucosal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats is associated with a reversible lung injury that is characterized by alveolar capillary endothelial-cell injury, increased microvascular permeability, interstitial edema formation, and intraalveolar hemorrhage and fibrin deposition. The role of mediators in this injury was analyzed using gravimetric data, microvascular permeability indices, electron microscopy, and a quantitative morphometric analysis. Neutrophil depletion induced by a specific antibody was highly protective against lung injury. Interruption of the complement pathway (using low dose Naja naja cobra venom factor) also protected against lung injury. Catalase and superoxide dismutase were also protective. The iron chelator deferoxamine and the hydroxyl radical scavenger, dimethylsulfoxide, were not protective against acute lung injury. These data suggest that complement, neutrophils, and neutrophil-derived (H2O2-dependent) oxygen products mediate lung injury that occurs secondary to cerulein-induced pancreatitis. In contrast to other models of neutrophil-dependent, oxygen-radical-mediated lung injury, this lung injury does not appear to be an iron-dependent and hydroxyl-radical mediated injury. We postulate that the process of acute pancreatitis leads to complement activation followed by neutrophil recruitment, sequestration, and adherence to alveolar capillary endothelial cells. Ultimately lung injury appears to result from local endothelial-cell injury secondary to neutrophil-generated oxygen products that may be myeloperoxidase dependent.\r"

Therefore a prospective study was designed to determine if abdominal drainage could be safely avoided after liver resection and was evaluated in 61 consecutive patients. There was one postoperative death (1.7%) from variceal bleeding. Four other patients (6.7%) developed an abdominal complication: two right subphrenic hematomas requiring reoperation in one case and two incisional ascitic leaks requiring incisional repair in one patient. There was neither a subphrenic abscess nor bile peritonitis. Postoperative hospitalization was 11.5 +/- 3 days in the entire group and 8.5 +/- 1 days in patients without complications. These results suggest that liver resection can be performed safely without abdominal drainage and that the routine use of drains is unnecessary.\r"

Mean age was 62 years and 75% were female. Symptoms, signs, and laboratory and imaging studies were uniformly unhelpful in determining the diagnosis. Early diagnosis at a stage amenable to surgical excision remains the sole salvation. Patients who receive chemotherapy did better than those who did not, but this is probably a reflection of patient selection. Newer treatment modalities are urgently needed.\r"

Desmoid tumors tend to grow steadily, regardless of tumor location. However differences in the aggressive nature of these tumors are seen when age and sex distributions are scrutinized. Although recurrence rates are high, excisional therapy is the best first approach. An exception is the case in which tumor excision is either particularly dangerous or likely to result in significant physical handicap. Radiation or drug therapy are most often used with recurrent disease or as an alternative to mutilating surgery. Although many pharmacologic approaches have been advocated, (including antiestrogen therapy, cyclic-AMP, and prostaglandin inhibition), results are anecdotal at best.\r"

To characterize the scope and consequences of childhood chest injury, we reviewed the records of 105 children (ages 1 month to 17 years, mean 7.6 years) with chest injuries admitted to a level I pediatric trauma center from 1981 to 1988. Nearly all injuries (97.1%) were due to blunt trauma, and more than 50% were traffic related. Rib fractures, commonly multiple, and pulmonary contusions occurred with nearly equal frequency (49.5% and 53.3%, respectively), followed by pneumothorax (37.1%) and hemothorax (13.3%). One fourth of all pneumothoraces were under tension. Significant intrathoracic injuries occurred without rib fractures in 52% of cases with blunt trauma. Associated head, abdominal, and orthopedic injuries were present in 68.6% of children reviewed. One in five received endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support for 1 to 109 days. Presence or absence of head injury neither increased the need for respiratory support (29.4% vs. 17.2%, respectively; p = 0.24) nor affected the duration of support for those who were ventilated (6.8 +/- 8.9 days vs. 3.3 +/- 2.6 days, excluding one ventilator-dependent head-injured patient and five early deaths). The presence of associated injuries, intubation, and pneumothorax or hemothorax all resulted in significantly longer hospitalizations and more severe injury as measured by Injury Severity Score (ISS). Age, rib fracture, and contusion had no effect. Rarely encountered were ruptured diaphragm (2 cases), transection of the aorta (1), major tracheobronchial tears (3), flail chest (1), and cardiac contusion (2). Only two of the three children with penetrating injuries and three of the 83 (3.6%) with blunt injuries underwent chest operations. Six children (7%) died, one from a penetrating injury and five from blunt mechanisms. Chest Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and ISS correlated significantly with mortality; age and head AIS did not. Rib fractures, lung contusions, and associated head, abdominal, and skeletal injuries are common because of the predominance of blunt-injury mechanisms. Nearly one half of chest injuries occurred without rib fractures. The need for ventilatory support is uncommon; when required, its duration is generally brief. Aortic transection, flail chest, and penetrating injuries more frequently encountered in adults and are uncommon in children. Thoracotomy generally is not required.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Two patients whose bypass procedures were initially unsatisfactory because of a poor choice for anastomosis stimulated a review of variations in the distal popliteal artery in 1000 femoral arteriograms. The popliteal arterial anatomy could be assessed in 605 extremities and the tibial arterial anatomy in 495 extremities. Seventy-five variant cases were identified. Normal branching of the popliteal artery was present in 92.2%. Among the 7.8% incidence of variants, the majority (72%) were either high origin of the anterior tibial artery or a trifurcation pattern. Of variant patterns to the foot (5.6%), the most common was that in which the supply to the distal posterior tibial artery arose from the peroneal artery. We propose a unified classification of the popliteal and tibial arterial variations that encompasses both anatomic areas. Variant arterial supply to the foot can be suspected when the infrapopliteal vessels show a hypoplastic or aplastic anterior or posterior tibial artery and compensatory hypertrophy of the peroneal artery. Knowledge of these variants is important to angiographers and vascular surgeons.\r"

  ".W": "Late failure of reversed vein bypass grafts is preceded by the appearance of stenotic lesions, which progress to total occlusion. These lesions appear either as intrinsic graft lesions or as new arteriosclerotic lesions in contiguous arteries. The present study summarizes the University of Pennsylvania experience with these lesions in 521 vein grafts inserted from 1979 to 1985. The grafts were grouped according to the site of the distal anastomosis; 231 above-knee popliteal (FP AK), 171 below-knee popliteal (FP BK), and 119 tibial (FT). The overall incidence of stenotic lesions was essentially identical with the three grafts (21%), but the relative incidence of intrinsic graft to arterial lesions was higher with the more distal grafts. The most common graft lesions developed adjacent to the proximal anastomosis, which is the narrowest part of a reversed vein graft. The popliteal artery was the most common site of outflow stenosis. There was negligible incidence of tibial lesions. The most common inflow arterial lesion was located in the common femoral and iliac arteries. The superficial femoral artery (SFA) was a rare site of inflow stenosis, even though it was at risk because 96 grafts originated from the SFA or popliteal artery. Sixty-seven per cent of the graft and 52% of the arterial lesions were treated successfully by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; the rest had minor surgical revisions. This resulted in a 19%, 10%, and 9% improvement in 5-year patency for the FT, FP BK, and FP AK bypasses. These results justify an aggressive policy of graft surveillance to identify and treat stenotic graft lesions before graft occlusion.\r"

Twenty-eight patients undergoing colectomy and ileoanal anastomosis were studied. Removal of the mucosal layer of the distal rectum was performed using a titanium probe vibrating at 23 kHZ with an amplitude of 300 microns. This method produces complete mucosal destruction and the resulting debris and irrigating fluid is removed through the hollow central portion of the probe. Healing of the ileoanal anastomosis does not appear to be adversely affected by the use of this technique. Because ultrasonic fragmentation is not dependent on the integrity of the submucosal plane, it may be advantageous in those cases in which severe inflammation and submucosal scarring make manual dissection of the rectal mucosa difficult to perform.\r"

DNA content was determined by flow cytometric analysis and each tumor was categorized as diploid or nondiploid. Of the parameters studied, Dukes' classification and tumor DNA ploidy were found to be significant prognostic indicators.

However, evidence supporting this association has not been consistent. We report on a prospective follow-up study of 103 males (ages 16 to 23 years), who were diagnosed as hyperactive (attention-deficit disorder with hyperactivity) between ages 6 and 12 years, and 100 normal controls. The official arrest records of all subjects who resided in New York State during the follow-up interval were obtained. Blind diagnoses (based on structured interviews with subjects and their parents) were made on 98% of the initial cohort at follow-up. Although other investigators have reported on the delinquent behavior of hyperactive children in a prospective design, to our knowledge, follow-up mental status has not been studied previously in relation to official arrest records. Significantly more probands than controls had been arrested (39% vs 20%), convicted (28% vs 11%), and incarcerated (9% vs 1%). The presence of an antisocial/conduct disorder in young adulthood almost completely accounted for the increased risk for criminal activities in the former hyperactive children whether or not it was accompanied by a substance use disorder. Continuing attention-deficit disorder with hyperactivity at follow-up, by itself, was not associated with arrest history. The findings support the view that childhood attention-deficit disorder with hyperactivity is a risk factor for later criminality, but that this relationship is almost exclusively mediated by the development of an antisocial disorder in early adulthood.\r"

However, concerns that the mild and often transient nature of these phenomena will foster unreliability have discouraged their use. We assessed the test-retest reliability of \"subdisorder\" anxiety symptoms in 104 outpatients with anxiety. Good to excellent agreement was found for lifetime occurrence of any panic attack, the spontaneous and situationally predisposed subtypes of panic, and five nonsocial irrational fears (public transportation, driving oneself, crowds, situations associated with death [eg, dead bodies and funerals], and cats and dogs). Four social and three additional nonsocial fears were considered to have adequate reliability. However, agreement on stimulus-bound panic, \"near\" panic attacks, persistent generalized anxiety, and the remaining nine nonsocial and six social irrational fears was only fair to poor. The major source of unreliability was variation in information reported by the subject to the rater.\r"

We found that during baseline patients with generalized anxiety disorder differed from controls on electromyographic, but not on autonomic, measures. During psychological stress tasks, patients with generalized anxiety disorder showed a weaker mean skin conductance response with a narrower range in both skin conductance and heart rate than controls. These findings suggest that sympathetic inhibition, rather than enhancement, occurs in patients with generalized anxiety disorder during performance stress.\r"

We attempted to determine if low electrodermal activity could be a genetic marker by testing subjects at genetic risk for affective disorder. High-risk subjects, 22 offspring of a parent with bipolar affective disorder, and 27 low-risk controls 15 to 25 years old had skin conductance recorded bilaterally during rest periods, presentation of 10 nonsignal tones, and performance of reaction-time and mental arithmetic tasks. There were no significant differences in skin conductance levels under any condition or in the frequency or amplitude of orienting responses to nonsignal tones. During task periods high-risk subjects showed significantly greater electrodermal activity that was lateralized to the left hand. Self-rated depression was higher in the high-risk group during task periods. The results show that low electrodermal activity is not a likely genetic marker for affective disorder but suggest that autonomic hyperresponsivity, atypically lateralized information processing, and depressive affect occur during mild stress in persons at risk for the development of affective disorder.\r"

The most common psychiatric features were abnormal behavior and personality change, although depression and cognitive impairment were also rated frequently. Schizophrenialike psychoses were rare, apparently occurring at no more than chance frequency. Psychiatric symptoms were related to neurologic rather than hepatic symptoms, and certain symptoms (incongruous behavior, irritability, and personality change) had a particularly significant relationship with bulbar and dystonic disorders but not with tremor. Psychiatric manifestations are important in Wilson's disease, and many of the psychopathologic features seem to have an organic basis.\r"

By comparison with controls and with patients suffering from Alzheimer-type dementia (in which there is also temporal horn enlargement), the change is highly significantly selective to the left hemisphere. This deviation was not accompanied by an increase in glial cell number (examined chemically by assay of diazepam-binding inhibitor immunoreactivity and microscopically by density of staining with the Holzer technique). The findings are consistent with the view that schizophrenia is a disorder of the genetic mechanisms that control the development of cerebral asymmetry.\r"

Giant cells in giant cell myocarditis and in the Aschoff lesions of rheumatic carditis expressed macrophage, but not myocyte, antigens, suggesting derivation along macrophage lineage.

  ".W": "Patterns of intermediate filament expression of 10 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs) were immunohistochemically evaluated using acetone-fixed frozen sections. Seven cases represented the storiform-pleomorphic subtype, 2 were of myxoid type, and 1 was of giant-cell type. All cases had been studied by electron microscopy, and no proof for the diagnoses of liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma could be obtained. All tumors showed prominent vimentin immunoreactivity in the tumor cells. Cytokeratin-positive neoplastic cells were found in 2 cases, and in the majority of tumor cells in 1 of these. The 68k neurofilament-positive cells were found in 2 cases. Desmin was not found beyond doubt in the neoplastic cells in any cases, and all cases were negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein. The expression of several types of intermediate filament indicates divergent differentiation properties in MFH and may suggest the heterogeneity of this entity, but more cases should be studied to elaborate any possible consistent patterns of intermediate filament expression in different types of MFH. The expression of multiple types of intermediate filament proteins in MFH can alternatively signify random activation of the corresponding genes in the primitive tumor cells. The complex patterns of intermediate filament proteins in morphologically defined MFHs should be taken into account in the practical immunohistologic analysis of tumors.\r"

  ".U": "90073177\r", 
  ".W": "Two distinct forms of microcalcification are found in breast disease. The more commonly recognized type is basophilic and nonbirefringent and consists predominantly of calcium phosphates (type II). The other type is a birefringent, colorless crystal that is composed of calcium oxalate (type I). It has not been emphasized in the literature that calcium oxalate can produce radiopacities and yet is easily overlooked in tissue sections. In this study, histologic sections taken from 127 randomly selected, mammographically directed biopsies were reviewed and the presence or absence of microcalcifications, the type of microcalcification, and the associated disease process were noted in each case. Seventy-eight of the 127 specimens were obtained because of suspicious calcifications detected by mammography and 9 (11.5%) contained only type I microcalifications, 9 (11.5%) contained both types I and II microcalcifications, and 48 (61.5%) contained only type II microcalcifications; in 12 specimens (15.4%), microcalcifications were not identified. The overall incidence of type I calcifications was 17.3% (22/127), but the incidence in those specimens obtained because of calcifications detected by mammography was 23.1% (18/78). Type I microcalcifications were found only in benign cysts and were not associated with carcinoma or epithelial hyperplasia, whereas type II microcalcifications were associated with benign or malignant lesions. These findings are in keeping with the hypothesis that type I microcalcifications are a product of secretion whereas type II microcalcifications are a result of cellular degeneration or necrosis. In biopsies in which type II microcalcifications are not identified, examination of sections under polarized light may reveal the presence of calcium oxalate crystals.\r"

The mass and the underlying bladder wall consisted of multiple cystic cavities of various sizes and hyperplastic smooth-muscle bundles. Light microscopy identified numerous tubuloglandular structures, most of them lined by transitional cell epithelium. Simple or ciliated columnar cells and occasional mucous cells were also present, particularly in the epithelium of cystic cavities. Some tubules had communicated with the bladder lumen.

Irradiation to the breast and regional lymph nodes was carried out with cobalt 60 teletherapy in 2-Gy fractions to 50 Gy, followed by an additional boost of 10 Gy to the tumorectomy site with coned electrons. Cosmesis was analyzed by scoring the effects of surgery, as well as the effects of irradiation, and by photographic assessment. After a follow-up of 24 to 119 months (median, 36 months), 82% of the patients were found to have good or excellent cosmetic scores. There was a trend that favored better cosmetic results in younger patients and in patients with outer-quadrant lesions. No significant impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on the cosmetic outcome or on the complications of treatment was demonstrated. There were six local recurrences (5.2%), three of which were true recurrences and the other three that were new primary tumors; 11 distant failures (9%) occurred. The following side effects from irradiation developed in only 5 patients (4.1%): match-line fibrosis (n = 2), soft-tissue necrosis (n = 1), and persistent tenderness (n = 2). The conditions of the two patients with persistent tenderness responded favorably with conservative management. We concluded that a lumpectomy, followed by radiation therapy, provides good cosmetic results without compromising the local control rate. If adjuvant chemotherapy is planned, we recommend that it be administered before radiation therapy in favor of concomitant therapy with both modalities.\r"

No specific factors achieved statistical significance; however, patients having more than one site of metastasis and patients whose metastases arose less than 5 years after treatment of the primary tumor tended to have shorter overall survival times. More than one modality of treatment was used in the majority of patients. Complete surgical resection of metastases offered the best chance for prolonged survival and palliation. With long survival times being the rule, several treatment modalities are often required to provide continuous palliation.\r"

We found that the oxygen delivery and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient on the third day after the diagnosis of ARDS were the two most important correctable correlates. Both eventually effected the development of multiple-system organ failure and survival. These data provide clinical evidence that optimization of both the oxygen delivery and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient after the onset of ARDS may allow resolution of ARDS, prevent additional organ dysfunction, and improve survival.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the incidence of decreased red blood cell deformability (RBCD) in sepsis and the association between decreased RBCD and oxygen free radical generation (as measured by malonyldialdehyde) and the occurrence of multiple-system organ failure (MSOF). Patients were divided into three groups: septic (n = 28), nonseptic (n = 15), and control (n = 5). Serial measurements of deformability index, malonyldialdehyde, and MSOF were made. The deformability index for the septic group (0.23 +/- 0.17) was significantly less than that for the nonseptic (1.12 +/- 0.48) and control (1.11 +/- 0.25) groups. The malonyldialdehyde levels for the septic group (4.5 +/- 1.0 nmol/mL) were significantly greater than those for the nonseptic (2.7 +/- 0.9 nmol/mL) and control (2.6 +/- 0.8 nmol/mL) groups. The MSOF index for the septic group (10.1 +/- 2.5) was significantly greater than that for the nonseptic (7.6 +/- 1.7) and control (6.0 +/- 0.0) groups. An inverse correlation existed between malonyldialdehyde and deformability index ( = .501, less than .001, n = 40) and between deformability index and MSOF index (= .350, less than .05, n = 61). We conclude that RBCD is decreased during human sepsis; free radicals generated during sepsis may play a role in the decrease in RBCD. Decreased RBCD may contribute to the MSOF that occurs during sepsis.\r"

We have studied pathophysiologic and histopathologic alterations in a potential model of multiple organ failure. Wistar rats received one of the following solutions by intraperitoneal injection: 4 mL of saline, 4 mL of mineral oil, or 1 mg per gram of body weight of zymosan A in 4 mL of mineral oil. Animals that received zymosan developed hypoxia, decreased creatinine clearance, and changes in hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 content and aniline hydroxylase activity. Bacterial translocation occurred in the zymosan group. The lungs, liver, and kidneys of the animals that received zymosan exhibited histopathologic changes. We conclude that this model fulfills our criteria for a model of multiple organ failure.\r"

Volume-pressure measurements were determined in the excised lungs using both air and saline, which eliminated surface tension forces. Total lung wet and dry weight, nitrogen level, and DNA and protein content were measured. Lungs of the rats that received TNF accepted significantly smaller volumes of air and saline at all pressures compared with the control group. Both the lung wet and dry weights increased with TNF. Lung DNA and protein content also increased, suggesting increased cellularity in the TNF-infused lungs. Thus, the lungs of the TNF-treated rats were stiffer, with reduced compliance values, and heavier due to increased water content and increased cellularity. These data indicate that sublethal administration of TNF in this rat model induces the adult respiratory distress syndrome and increases the work potential of respiration.\r"

  ".W": "The local application of antibiotics to treat intraperitoneal contamination has been used with variable results. Liposomes are not rapidly absorbed from the peritoneal cavity, offering a potential delivery system for intraperitoneal antibiotics. The effects of liposome-incorporated antibiotic administration in a fecal peritonitis model were compared with the effects of conventional intraperitoneal and intramuscular antibiotics. Rats were divided into four groups: untreated, intramuscular cefoxitin, intraperitoneal cefoxitin, and intraperitoneal liposome-incorporated cefoxitin. Quantitative blood cultures were drawn at 4 and 24 hours. Liposome delivery of cefoxitin significantly reduced mortality and bacteremia at 4 and 24 hours compared with control subjects and conventional antibiotic groups. Peritoneal abscess formation tended to decrease in the liposome antibiotic group (mean +/- SEM, 6.86 +/- 0.79) compared with the group receiving free intraperitoneal administration of antibiotics (10.33 +/- 1.63). We conclude that liposomal delivery significantly enhances the effectiveness of cefoxitin in this model of peritonitis.\r"

  ".W": "Activated macrophages convert L-arginine to citrulline and unstable nitrogen oxides that have cytotoxic properties. We recently have shown that the inhibition of protein synthesis in Kupffer cell (KC):hepatocyte (HC) coculture, following exposure to gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), is due to the metabolism of L-arginine by this cytotoxic pathway. Although this finding supports a role for activated KCs and the L-arginine-dependent mechanism in the HC dysfunction seen in sepsis, it and previous studies have failed to demonstrate direct damage to HCs by adjacent KCs. The current study was undertaken to determine if KCs exposed to lipopolysaccharide could directly damage HCs and, if so, whether the damage was dependent on the metabolism of L-arginine. By using the release of aspartate aminotransferase as a marker of HC damage, it was found that a significant aspartate aminotransferase release by KC:HC cocultures in response to lipopolysaccharide occurred only if L-arginine was present. In addition, requirements for significant aspartate aminotransferase release included KC:HC ratios of 7.5:1 or greater and L-arginine concentrations of 1 mmol or more. Although the KC-induced damage was mild, these results show that in vitro HC damage in KC:HC coculture does require the metabolism of L-arginine and supports a hypothesis that toxic L-arginine metabolites may contribute to liver cell damage in patients with sepsis.\r"

Since severe injury is frequently complicated by immunosuppression as manifested by sepsis, we hypothesized that the wound may be a source of factors that impair host immune responses. Therefore, we studied the effect of systemic wound fluid administration on the survival of rats subjected to an acute peritonitis model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, fitted with internal jugular catheters 48 hours previously, underwent cecal ligation and puncture with a 23-gauge needle. Immediately after the operation, rats were treated intravenously every 12 hours with either wound fluid obtained from 10-day-old healing wounds and adjusted to 10 mg of protein per milliliter or rat serum. In vitro testing of the wound fluid showed it to be highly inhibitory of thymic lymphocyte mitogenesis. Rats treated with wound fluid had significantly higher mortality after peritonitis than did control rats. The data show that the wound contains factors that can impair host immune responses to sepsis. This suggests that the wound may be the source of posttraumatic host immunosuppression.\r"

It is known that sublethal doses of endotoxin induce transient refractoriness (tolerance) to some of its effects. We studied the role of TNF in endotoxin tolerance in rats. Weight loss, lethality, and TNF production were measured after an initial dose of endotoxin and after subsequent doses. Weight loss reached its peak 72 hours after the initial endotoxin challenge, followed by recovery even under continued administration of endotoxin. While tolerant, rats could survive a dose of endotoxin that was lethal for 100% of naive rats. The high serum levels of TNF, observed 90 minutes after the first dose of endotoxin, markedly diminished when rechallenged during tolerance. Recovery of responsiveness to these effects followed the refractory phase by 3 weeks. We concluded that endotoxin tolerance is associated with a reduced secretion of TNF.\r"

Risk factors for CMV disease included donor CMV seropositivity, antilymphocyte therapy, and retransplantation. The mean time of occurrence of CMV disease was 38.3 days after transplantation, and the most frequent site of disease was the hepatic allograft. A total of 69 patients were treated with intravenous ganciclovir, with a prompt and lasting response documented in 51 (73.9%). The remaining 18 (26.1%) developed recurrent CMV disease, which was more common after primary CMV exposure. Cytomegalovirus disease was ultimately controlled by ganciclovir in 94.2% of cases. This disease occurs early after transplantation and can be related to well-defined risk factors. Although ganciclovir therapy is effective, preliminary experience with prophylaxis shows promise in reducing the incidence of CMV disease.\r"

This synergistic effect was not seen in cells from patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. Fatty-acid analysis of neutrophils from patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and controls showed remarkable similarity in all quantities of fatty acids measured except for arachidonic acid, where there was a 22% reduction in patients' cells compared with controls. Assay of the rate of generation of LTB4 and its degradation product, 20-hydroxy LTB4, revealed that reduced LTB4 generation in patients' neutrophils was not due to increased degradation of LTB4 by hydroxylase enzymes. When the amount of LTB4 being generated per milliliter of whole blood was analyzed in the patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and compared with controls, it was determined that the potential to generate LTB4 in patients in the intensive care unit was three to five times greater than in controls.\r"

We have examined the significance of MRSA colonization and infection in 1100 consecutively admitted, seriously burned patients in whom vancomycin was used to treat all staphylococcal infections. Colonization with S aureus (SA) was identified in 658 patients, in 319 of whom MRSA colonization was identified. Two hundred fifty-three SA infections occurred in 178 patients; of these infections, 58% were pulmonic and 38% were bacteremic. Methicillin-resistant SA infections occurred in 58 of the SA-infected patients. A severity index, based on multiple-regression analysis of mortality as a function of burn size and age in the study population, was used to estimate expected mortality. We demonstrated no measurable increase in mortality attributable to MRSA in this population of burned, SA-infected patients. The results question the clinical and economic value of added control practices, such as closing of units, refusal of transfer or admission, added isolation, treatment of carriers, furlough of colonized staff, and other expensive measures that are specifically directed at prevention of MRSA infections in critical care areas.\r"

This study examines the coexistence of these two problems and suggests a common underlying biochemical system. We examined these two entities by retrospective chart review and cerebrospinal fluid biochemistry. We found a prevalence of 10.9% for dementia, 51% for depression, and 5.4% for coincident depression and dementia. In a prospective study of patients with Parkinson's disease we found a continuum of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations. Patients who were either depressed or demented had lower concentrations of this metabolite than other patients with Parkinson's disease, but patients who were depressed and demented had the lowest levels. These results suggest that the coexistence of dementia and depression represents a unique clinical entity in Parkinson's disease. The serotonergic system may be involved in depression and dementia because evidence of a cumulative effect on this biochemical system is present.\r"

Patients with Parkinson's disease had more severe impairment related to speed of information processing, and, unlike patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type, they also had disturbance of mood. The nature of visuospatial abnormalities also differentiated the two groups. The pattern of neuropsychological differences is consistent with the cortical-subcortical hypothesis.\r"

Twenty of these subjects were prone to falling and the remaining 20 were nonfalling controls. These two groups were comparable in terms of age and sex (mean age, 83.3 years [SE, 1.7 years]). The group of fallers had significantly worse gait and equilibrium scores and a greater degree of white-matter hypodensity on computed tomography. White-matter hypodensity correlated with impaired gait and equilibrium scores but not with impaired performance on cognitive testing.

Although sound recognition performance correlated significantly with auditory verbal comprehension scores, a sound recognition defect was also identifiable in the subgroup of patients with SDAT who had normal verbal comprehension. Qualitative analysis of sound recognition errors revealed that nonaphasic patients with SDAT made predominantly acoustic errors, whereas semantic errors were found almost exclusively in aphasic patients. These findings suggest that the auditory sound agnosia of patients with SDAT may be subdivided into perceptual-discriminative and semantic-associative types.\r"

This index has been calculated for each ear separately and after adding the responses of both ears. Its reliability is shown to be better in the latter situation. In all of the patients the interhemispheric asymmetry index was in the normal range for the Na component. For the Pa component this index was abnormal in 11 patients with cortical temporal lobe or subcortical lesions interrupting acoustic radiations. These results confirm that the Pa is dependent on the integrity of acoustic radiations and auditory cortex in the supratemporal plane, whereas the Na component would be generated at a subcortical level. Unilateral extinction of the dichotic listening test was found to correlate with abnormal Pa component asymmetry in the case of lesions involving the auditory structures.\r"

Mean flow values for averaged hemispheric, infarct, and homologous contralateral regions of interest (ROIs) were determined. All patient CBF values were significantly below comparable CBF ROIs in neurologically normal controls using Wilcoxon's two-sample rank testing. Multiple regression analysis disclosed a significant correlation between contralateral CBF are both localized CBF in the infarct ROI and patient age. Correlations between contralateral CBF and dependency score or severity of neurologic deficit at time of positron emission tomography, expired PCO2, mean arterial blood pressure, serum glucose or hematocrit, risk factor score, and number of days studied after stroke were not statistically significant. Although we did not identify the biologic mechanisms involved, we conclude that CBF reduction contralateral to a strictly unilateral ischemic infarction is due to a combination of aging and transhemispheric diaschisis.\r"

Subjects were asked whether they experienced headache in the past year, the frequency and severity of their headaches, and whether they experienced three symptoms of migraine: unilaterality, nausea or vomiting, an aura preceding the headache. Prevalence of headache in those aged more than 65 years declined with age in both men and women; women had a higher prevalence in each age group. The same was true for frequent, severe, and migrainous headache. We examined age- and sex-adjusted correlations of headache with several medical and social factors. Prevalence of any headache was strongly associated with joint pain, depression, bereavement, waking during the night, use of eyeglasses, symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and self-assessment of health. Similar variables were associated with frequency, severity, and migrainous symptoms, and thus could not be distinguished among these various types.\r"

He traces the development of ethics teaching at that school and of his conviction that medical cases must be the focus of ethics education, not merely as illustrations but as the matrix of the ethical problems encountered and their resolution. Eventually, a required fourth-year course was developed that focused upon four essential aspects of medical cases: medical indications, patient preferences, quality of life, and external socioeconomic factors. This course and its evaluation--including inherent quandaries of evaluating ethics teaching--are described; he attributes the success of the course to the appropriateness of the four-part format for analysis and the support and participation of leading members of the medical faculty. Throughout this description of the UCSF program are short descriptions of the additions to the bioethics literature that were made during the mid- and late 1970s. The author then describes the present ethics teaching program at the University of Washington School of Medicine, where he has taught since 1987, and the intriguing and perhaps innovative possibilities for expanding and redefining that program.\r"

The author discusses several crucial decisions made in the first year of the program (1978-79) that affected the nature and development of the program: first, to begin the medical humanities courses in the preclinical required curriculum and use these courses as a base to build on in the clinical years; second, to develop a program through all years of training while preserving time for faculty research; third, to arrange for program faculty to team-teach with clinical faculty; fourth, to show the importance of the humanities programs and courses by the way in which they were constructed and situated in the curriculum; and fifth, to seek primarily to teach a method of inquiry.\r"

They then describe in detail such a program at Loyola University of Chicago Medical Center; the program consists of a four-year required curriculum that is clinically reinforced by having the students accompany attending physicians on rounds and is taught by faculty representing a wide range of disciplines in medicine and other fields. The paper offers several guidelines to the person or persons who would organize and direct a clinical medical humanities program, describes obstacles that the Loyola program faced when it was getting started, presents the purpose, focus, and curricular topics of the program, and discusses its future. The authors conclude that the use of the clinically oriented approach will continue to prevail in medical humanities teaching, both at Loyola and in medical humanities programs overall. This approach challenges good teachers to make their best efforts at reconciling their own disciplines with that of medicine; in this process, a new medical humanities discipline emerges that is not so much an application of the humanities to medicine as it is an evocation of humanities themes from the clinical encounter itself.\r"

The focus of the article is on two key differences between the Penn State ethics program and most other such programs: the teaching of medical ethics within the context of other issues of value and meaning in medicine, and the fact that the humanities faculty is involved in the activities and structures of the medical center of which the medical school is a part.

The residency program was founded in 1980 to develop a model training program for internal medicine residents with a primary care focus. The three objective of the curriculum are (1) to enable residents to recognize the ethical implications of both inpatient and outpatient clinical cases, (2) to teach residents to recognize ethics issues and alternatives in order to arrive at a well-rounded clinical strategy, and (3) to help them learn to communicate sensitively with patients and others about these ethics issues and proposed management plans. The six major topics covered by the curriculum (for example, informed consent) are co-taught in a seminar format by one or more of the three members of the multidisciplinary ethics faculty (a philosopher, an internist, and a communications specialist) and experienced physicians. The authors describe the program, the roles of the various faculty members, the program's focus on case discussions, the receptivity of the residents and faculty to the program, the use and training of a multidisciplinary faculty, efforts aimed at evaluation, and future directions of the program.\r"

Results indicate a statistically significant increase (p less than or equal to .0001) in the level of moral reasoning of students exposed to the medical ethics course, regardless of format. Moreover, the unadjusted posttest scores indicated that the case-study method was significantly (p less than or equal to .03) more effective than the lecture method in increasing students' level of moral reasoning. When adjustment were made for the pretest scores, however, this difference was not statistically significant (p less than or equal to .18). Regression analysis by linear panel techniques revealed that age, gender, undergraduate grade-point average, and scores on the Medical College Admission Test were not related to the changes in moral-reasoning scores. All of the variance that could be explained was due to the students' being in one of the two experimental groups. In comparison with the control group, the change associated with each experimental format was statistically significant (lecture, p less than or equal to .004; case study, p less than or equal to .0001). Various explanations for these findings and their implications are given.\r"

Specifically, the residents were given a list of 35 medical ethics topics and asked to indicate whether they would like more attention to a topic, or whether it had received enough or too much attention. (They could also indicate that they though the topic was inappropriate for attention during residency.) The residents were also given a list of 17 teaching methods for medical ethics and asked to indicate whether each method was very useful, somewhat useful, or not useful. Sixty-one percent of the residents responded. Approximately three-fourths of these had had some formal teaching about medical ethics in both medical school and residency, and nearly all indicated that they wanted more ethics training on specific topics. Certain topics were chosen as particularly suitable or unsuitable for such training; many of those judged as deserving more attention concerned legal issues and end-of-life issues. Most of the responding residents regarded standard clinical teaching formats as very useful for learning about medical ethics but regarded several other methods are not useful. The authors discuss the implications of these and related findings.\r"

To assess the mechanism of its antihypertensive effect, the hemodynamic and endocrinological responses to terazosin were determined before, 3, and 12 months after the administration of terazosin. Blood pressure significantly decreased within 2 weeks after the start of terazosin and its effect was sustained throughout the 12 month period. Pulse rate did not change except slight increase in the third month. The hemodynamic studies revealed that total peripheral resistance significantly decreased and cardiac output slightly increased, indicating that the antihypertensive effect of terazosin is mainly produced by its vasodilation. Blood volume and plasma volume did not change. Although plasma renin activity remained the same, plasma aldosterone significantly decreased in response to terazosin. Plasma noradrenaline increased in the third month, but returned to the baseline level in the twelfth month. Thus, terazosin monotherapy lowered blood pressure throughout one year without drug tolerance including volume expansion and/or accentuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or sympathetic function.\r"

This practice was correlated with physician opinions about the efficacy of hypertension treatment and the reported influence of pharmaceutical representatives on physician practice.

  ".W": "The clinical usefulness of the quadriceps H-reflex is limited because of the difficulty of elicitation and its inherent variability in amplitude. In the present study we attempted to identify the influence of methodological variables (head position and remote muscle contractions) on the amplitude of the H-reflex evoked in vastus medialis, vastus lateralis and rectus femoris from the right leg of 13 healthy adult subjects. Square wave stimuli (1-ms duration) were delivered percutaneously to the femoral nerve. The 50% maximal amplitude H-reflexes were evoked while the subject reclined with head facing to the right, left, up and down or while the subject performed Jendrassik's maneuver. The results show a significant increase in the reflex amplitude when the subject's head was turned to the right; there was either a mild increase or no change in amplitude of the response when the subjects faced to the left, up and down. The evoked potential tended to decrease when the subjects closed their eyes; however, the tendency to increase with neck position was not changed. Remote muscle contractions enhanced the amplitude of the response. These results present further evidence of the characteristics of the quadriceps H-reflex and identify postural influences as one controllable source of variability in the L3-L4 root electrodiagnostic test.\r"

This cDNA encoded a functional trans-activator (TAT) as shown by cotransfection into murine cells with a HIV promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase DNA construct. The tat cDNA was cloned into an avian retroviral expression vector, a modified spleen necrosis virus (SNV), and high-titer infectious stocks of recombinant virus (SNV-tat) were recovered from dog cells. Hybridization analyses indicated that SNV-tat was stably propagated in these cells for months. We also prepared recombinant cells that stably carry reporter genes, either a human gene encoding a soluble CD4 receptor (sCD4) or the human preprorenin gene, under the transcriptional control of the HIV promoter. Medium obtained from these cell cultures after infection with control viruses or an SNV carrying an antisense tat contained only low background levels of sCD4 or prorenin (HRN) as determined by specific immunoassays (1-10 ng protein per 10(6) cells per ml medium). In contrast, cells infected with SNV carrying tat in the transcriptional sense orientation secreted 75 +/- 7 ng sCD4 and 73 +/- 4 ng HRN per 10(6) cells per ml medium. Moreover, these proteins were constitutively secreted at these levels during months of subculturing. The data indicate that sCD4 and HRN are secreted from these cells because of a TAT-mediated trans-activation of the HIV reporter gene DNA and/or RNA. This combination of recombinant cells, SNV-tat, and specific immunoassays provide a rapid, quantitative, and safe bioassay to seek inhibitors of TAT.\r"

  ".W": "A new approach to detect and enumerate HIV-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in the peripheral blood was developed using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) methodology. ASC to an HIV envelope recombinant protein were demonstrated in 75% of 16 adults and 72% of 21 children with untreated AIDS or ARC and in 63% of 34 asymptomatically infected adults but in none of the 51 HIV antibody-negative individuals. Only 1 of the 13 adults receiving AZT therapy yielded a positive reaction, and 27% of the 30 infants born to seropositive mothers were found to have HIV-ASC. The number of HIV-ASC in positive individuals varied from 8 to 202 per 10(6) circulating mononuclear cells. The reactivity was specifically inhibited by soluble HIV antigen and was abrogated by cycloheximide, indicating that the observed reaction was the result of de novo synthesis of HIV-specific antibodies. Nonspecific polyclonal B cell activation was unlikely to be responsible for the results observed as no reactivity was found to a common antigen, tetanus toxoid. Since circulating antigen-specific ASC reflect persistent or recent antigenic stimulation, our findings indicate that this new approach could provide a dynamic perspective of the natural course of virus-immune system interactions in individuals infected with HIV, as well as in those undergoing prophylactic or therapeutic interventions.\r"

SBL-K135 is a new HIV-2 isolate obtained from a patient with clinical AIDS from Guinea-Bissau.

Among the HIV-2--positive sera, 91% neutralized any of the HIV-2 isolates, 67% neutralized both HIV-2 isolates, and 37% neutralized any of the HIV-1 isolates. Thus, neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1-- and HIV-2--positive sera can be cross-reacting, type-specific, or strain-specific. The cross-neutralizing titers were lower than the neutralizing titers against the type-specific viral isolates. The presence of cross-neutralizing antibodies was related to the presence of neutralizing antibodies against both type-specific isolates.\r"

  ".W": "The uptake of 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine was examined in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and uninfected T cell line (H9 cells), a B cell line (Namalwa), and in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. After a 10-minute incubation at ambient temperature, the intracellular 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine-derived radioactivity was 8- to 16-fold higher than the extracellular radioactivity. In metabolically inactive cells (0 degrees C), the intracellular and extracellular 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine-derived radioactivities were nearly equal. In infected and noninfected H9 cells, a large excess of p-nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside or pyrimidine nucleosides weakly inhibited the uptake of 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (7-30%), whereas deoxycoformycin was a stronger inhibitor (50-80%). Purine nucleosides minimally enhanced the uptake (10-20%). The cellular uptake was not associated with the accumulation of dideoxyadenosine triphosphate. In normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the uptake of 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine was inhibited by all agents except 2'-deoxyadenosine (15% enhancement). In contrast to H9 cells, the formation and accumulation of dideoxyadenosine triphosphate paralleled the uptake of dideoxyadenosine. The results of these studies suggest that the major route of transport of 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine into cells is by simple diffusion and that different metabolic patterns exist among cell lines and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. An understanding of these cellular differences could aid in the development of therapeutic strategies directed against HIV.\r"

The flow properties of white cells were tested after myocardial infarction, by measuring the filtration rates of cell suspensions through 8 microns pore filters. Compared with mononuclear cells from age matched controls, mononuclear cells from patients with infarction showed impaired filterability within the first day after the onset of pain; this condition persisted for at least two days and by day 10 it was improved. On day 1, granulocyte filterability and the proportion showing morphological evidence of activation were nearly normal. By day 3 the flow resistance and activation had increased, but the changes seen depended on the age of the patient. The filterability and activation of granulocytes from patients aged less than 60 were significantly increased from day 1, whereas there were no changes in granulocytes from patients aged greater than 60 years. Suspensions of unfractionated white cells showed changes intermediate between the mononuclear cells and granulocytes. A group of five patients who presented with chest pain but who were subsequently found not to have had an infarction showed no evidence of abnormal filterability or activation. The changes in filterability probably reflect white cell activation, which may have an adverse effect on the perfusion of the ischaemic myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "An electrogram was recorded from the angioplasty catheter guide wire when coronary blood flow was interrupted in 20 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from the right ventricular septum together with the routine electrocardiogram. The patients were studied during angioplasty for lesions in the left anterior descending (12), circumflex (3), and right coronary arteries (6). ST elevation in the electrogram recorded in the left anterior descending and circumflex systems was usually more obvious than that in the electrocardiogram. Signals obtained from the right coronary artery were of very low amplitude and registered only minimal ST changes. The ST elevation developed in the electrogram during insertion of the catheter before inflation of the balloon in 11 of the 15 patients undergoing angioplasty of the left system. In eight of the patients showing pre-inflation ST elevation the ST shift lessened after successive inflations. Monophasic action potential recordings were obtained during 45 balloon inflations in 19 patients. In those patients undergoing angioplasty for lesions of the circumflex coronary artery the monophasic action potential showed no change during balloon inflation. In patients undergoing angioplasty for the right coronary artery the mean normalised duration at 60 seconds' occlusion was 99.6 (1.5)% of control. Of a total of 25 occlusions in the patients undergoing angioplasty for the left anterior descending coronary artery 19 showed shortening of less than 5%, five showed shortening between 5 and 10%, and one showed a shortening of 16.4% in the monophasic action potential. The QT interval was satisfactorily measured in the electrogram during 36 balloon inflations, and in 24 of these it was also measured in the electrocardiogram. QT changes in the electrogram tended to be the opposite of those in the electrocardiogram. When changes in RR interval were minimal (less than 20 ms) during the balloon inflation 14 of 17 electrograms showed QT prolongation but only one of 12 electrocardiograms showed prolongation. Conversely one of 17 electrograms showed shortening compared with eight of 12 electrocardiograms. There was angiographic evidence of the development of collaterals in six of 15 patients undergoing angioplasty of the left system. ST segment elevation in both the electrogram and electrocardiogram was less pronounced in these patients than in those without evidence of the development of collaterals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Despite treatment with 5-7 (median 6) antiarrhythmic drugs symptoms had persisted in all the patients. Cathodal discharges of 0.5-39.5 J were delivered to the distal electrode (in one case in parallel with the middle electrode). In all patients shocks produced complete atrioventricular block; this was permanent in eleven (79%). Four patients required a second procedure. In one patient, only a transient atrioventricular block could be produced and catheter ablation with a conventional power source also failed. In the other two atrioventricular conduction was modified such that previously ineffective treatment produced satisfactory control of heart rate. The cumulative energy delivered to those in whom permanent complete heart block resulted ranged from 3.6 to 97.8 (mean 38.3) J with a mean of three shocks (range 1-7) delivered per patient.

Fifteen of the 26 patients had had at least one episode of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation each day in the period immediately before the intravenous administration of amiodarone. Amiodarone controlled ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in nine of these 15 patients; in three further cases it was successful when supplemented by additional administration of a previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drug and ventricular pacing. Two patients died despite these measures. In one, the amiodarone infusion had to be stopped because of an arrhythmogenic effect. Sustained deterioration of haemodynamic function or of pre-existing intraventricular conduction disturbances was never seen. Intravenous amiodarone was effective in terminating sustained ventricular tachycardia and in preventing frequent episodes of ventricular arrhythmia that were refractory to other antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

To assess the pitfalls of using valve gradients alone 636 patients with aortic stenosis in whom the aortic valve area had been calculated by the Gorlin formula were studied. The correlation between valve area and aortic gradients was poor. No gradient was found that was both sensitive and specific for aortic stenosis. The maximum predictive accuracy was 81% for a mean gradient of 30 mm Hg and 80% for a peak gradient of 30 mm Hg. A mean gradient of 50 mm Hg or a peak gradient of 60 mm Hg were specific with a 90% or more positive predictive value. It proved difficult, however, to find a lower limit with a 90% negative predictive value. Patients with severe aortic stenosis and low gradients (peak or mean gradient of less than 30 mm Hg) had small ventricles (on both angiographic and echocardiographic data) with good ejection fractions and so were unlikely to be detected subjectively. In comparison patients with mild aortic stenosis and low gradients tended to have more aortic regurgitation but have similar degrees of left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiographic or electrocardiographic criteria. The aortic valve area should be measured in all patients with the suspicion of severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of less than 50 mm Hg (50% of patients in this study) or a peak gradient of less than 60 mm Hg (47% of patients in this study).\r"

The distribution of other antigens was not significantly different in the two groups. The distribution of blood group antigens, immunoglobulin concentrations, and disease severity was similar in patients with the HLA-DR4 antigen and those without it.

Four had anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery and two had anomalous origin of the left pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta. Two of these six patients had tetralogy of Fallot. Two patients died in the first month of life. No changes in the pulmonary vasculature were seen at necropsy. Corrective surgery was attempted in two patients with associated tetralogy of Fallot when they were two years old but both died. At necropsy there was severe pulmonary vascular disease in the lung supplied by the anomalous pulmonary artery but no pulmonary vascular hypertensive changes in the lung supplied by the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle. Two recent patients underwent successful anastomosis of the anomalous pulmonary artery to the main pulmonary artery at three months and one month and three weeks of age respectively. Intraoperative lung biopsy in the latter patient showed early changes in both lungs. Both echocardiography and cardiac catheterisation were used in the diagnoses. Systemic or suprasystemic pressures were found in the pulmonary artery arising from the right ventricle as well as the anomalous pulmonary artery in the three patients without tetralogy of Fallot. Anomalous origin of a pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta is a distinct entity and differs from other aorto-pulmonary arterial connections. Early surgical intervention is recommended in all patients (including those patients with associated tetralogy of Fallot) because of the risk of rapid development of irreversible pulmonary vascular disease.\r"

In the preterm labour group 24 women had normal placental histology, and gestational age was 34 (31-36) weeks (median and range); 18 women had evidence of chorioamnionitis and gestational age was significantly shorter, 30 (24-36) weeks; three other patients had placental abruption. In the absence of inflammatory infiltration of these tissues the highest PGE output (fmol/mg dry weight/2 h) was found after labour at term and the lowest after uncomplicated preterm labour: 2640 (360-15,580) (median and range) compared with 1414 (164-11,045) in amnion, 677 (100-3245) compared with 308 (39-1086) in choriodecidua, and 1200 (520-3022) compared with 578 (150-1859) in placenta, respectively. Tissues showing chorioamnionitis produced much higher outputs of PGE from amnion (12,278, 1799-82,617) and from choriodecidua (1018, 216-11,768), but not from placenta (616, 89-4131). Chorioamnionitis seems to cause very early preterm labour by increasing PG production in the amnion and choriodecidua.\r"

Replies were received from 253 (92%) of 276 consultant obstetric units canvassed. Biophysical methods of assessing fetal well-being in the antepartum period are almost universally employed and are accepted as the best discriminators of the need to deliver the pregnancy. The number of fetal heart rate monitors on labour wards has increased by 88%. Overall, 63% of units monitor more than 60% of their patients in labour, and 87% permit suitably trained midwives to apply fetal scalp electrodes, which must now be regarded as standard practice. There is still a need for a simplified technique for fetal blood sampling. The perinatal mortality rate correlates with a prematurity factor and probably bears a greater relation to the population served than to the degree of monitoring provided.\r"

Most patients were delivered for cardiotocographic fetal distress or unstable maternal blood pressure. Eighty-five babies (80%) survived and were well at follow-up at 1 year; the perinatal mortality was 123/1000 total births. One patient had postpartum eclampsia, one had pulmonary oedema and one had transient renal failure, but all mothers left hospital well. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the primary positive factor for survival of a healthy baby was gestational age, which was strongly correlated with birthweight. The need for caesarean section as an emergency, hypotension after parenteral hydralazine, intrauterine growth retardation, and severe proteinuria were adverse factors. Intraventricular haemorrhage had a major adverse effect on neonatal survival; it was predisposed to by prolonged maternal hypertension and by low gestational age.\r"

  ".W": "The composition of the connective tissue of human cervix and corpus uteri was studied in tissue specimens from seven nonpregnant women and 14 pregnant women, delivered at term by section, to examine spontaneous cervical ripening and labour-induced changes in both the uterine and the cervical connective tissue. The main finding in both the cervix and the corpus was a large (40-60%) decrease of the collagen concentration. The collagen extractability, obtained by pepsin digestion, was increased twofold, suggesting a change of the organization of the collagen fibrils. This reorganization process could also be demonstrated by a large increase of the collagenolytic activity demonstrated with an artificial DNP-peptide substrate. The concentrations of sulphated glycosaminoglycans was lower in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. The results show that both the cervix and the corpus uteri contain substantial amounts of connective tissue components (collagen, sulphated glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronic acid) and that during ripening, reconstruction of the connective tissue components occurs in both sites. This indicates that the cervical state reflects that of the myometrium.\r"

Placental production of the two protein hormones, hCG and hPL, did take place, and whereas the circulating levels were not as high as in normal pregnancies, levels did usually increase before clinical evidence of miscarriage occurred. hCG was not a sensitive discriminator of subsequent failure. In these women there were no significant hormone differences between those with evidence of a fetus and those without.\r"

Discharge rates for both acute and chronic disease increased over the review period and there was a 28% increase in the discharge rate for total disease. Women in their 20s were most likely to be involved and this group showed the greatest increase in the discharge rate, both for acute and chronic disease. In the 20-24-year age group the rate of discharge for acute disease rose by 50%, from 125.6/100,000 in 1975 to 189.0/100,000 in 1985. Patients with a diagnosis of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease tended to be older than those with acute disease. Women who were divorced were more at risk of both acute and chronic forms of the disease than single or married women. Increase in the use of surgery to confirm the diagnosis occurred only for those with chronic disease. About a quarter of patients with acute disease had the diagnosis confirmed surgically, and this proportion did not change in the period studied, although laparoscopy increased as laparotomy decreased.\r"

  ".W": "Autoimmunity to collagen was investigated in several naturally occurring arthropathies of the dog. Increased levels of serum anti-native collagen type II antibody, as assessed by ELISA, were shown in 72.4% of dogs with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 88% of dogs with infective arthritis (IA) and 52% of dogs with osteoarthritis (OA) (p less than 0.001). The mean levels of antibody in cruciate disease patients (CR) were also significantly increased compared to control dogs (p less than 0.01). Serum anti-collagen antibody in OA dogs correlated with that in precipitated serum immune complexes. There was also a correlation between anti-collagen antibody level in synovial fluid and in synovial fluid complexes in dogs with rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament. In all patient groups, collagenase digestion of polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitates from sera and synovial fluids caused a significant rise in specific antibody levels to collagen, indicating the presence of collagen-anti-collagen complexes in all arthropathies. In dogs with RA, the levels of collagen-specific antibody in synovial fluid complexes correlated with the total IgG in these complexes. These findings implicate collagen-anti-collagen complexes in the pathogenesis of naturally occurring joint diseases in the dog, but they are unlikely to be the primary aetiological mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Fatigue, a complex symptom, significantly affects the quality of life in many patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To understand this phenomenon, 23 patients with SLE and fatigue were studied. Standardized tests of depression (NIMH), fatigue, exercise tolerance (ETT) on a bicycle ergometer, and SLE activity were obtained. At baseline, SLE patients had significantly lower maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) than normals (p less than 0.005). Adjusted for age and sex, SLE patients perform at 54% of their expected maximum VO2, which is similar to published data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Depression by NIMH was not correlated with VO2 max or length of time on ETT. Fatigue measured by Profile of Mood States (POMS) was correlated with ETT time (r = 0.476, p less than 0.025) and with VO2 max (r = -0.402, p less than 0.07). After an 8-week aerobic conditioning programme the experimental group increased their aerobic capacity by 19% in contrast to 8% in controls. This change correlated with decreased fatigue as measured by visual analogue scales. Exercise did not exacerbate disease, and only two of 16 experimental subjects experienced transient joint symptoms during exercise.\r"

PA X-rays of the knee are positioned on a conventional viewing box. A video image of the radiograph is converted to digital form, stored and displayed on a closed circuit television monitor. This is edited and analysed by a microcomputer. After careful positioning under a computer generated grid on the television screen, automatic measurements are made using an edge detection facility. Two different edge detection algorithms were compared. Reproducibility is very good. Inter- and intra-observer relationships are also good with no significant difference between observers using a paired t-test and very good correlations. Results show that rapid, reliable and accurate measurement of joint space size can be achieved using digital image analysis. The application of image handling computers to radiological scoring is important in our understanding of joint destruction and the progression of the rheumatic diseases.\r"

A 4-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial followed by a 4-month open study showed that amantadine could under these circumstances be of considerable therapeutic benefit while having no effect on patients without elevated antibody titres against influenza A.\r"

No other renal tubular abnormalities were detected. Comparing urate metabolism with that of four cases of inborn renal hypouricaemia, the degree of uricosuria was lower. One patient showed elevation of serum and urinary oxypurine, which normalized with return of a normal blood uric acid level. In all cases, the serum urate returned to normal after improvement of liver function. We suggest that renal uricosuria due to an isolated renal defect of urate transport might contribute to hypouricaemia in these cases but that inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity might also contribute to this phenomenon.\r"

The tests, an inexpensive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) fingerprick test for tetanus antibodies and a modification of the Schick skin test for susceptibility to diphtheria, were administered before the booster injection. One week later the ELISA test was repeated and the result of the modified Schick test read. On both occasions a diphtheria microneutralization assay was done for \"gold standard\" evidence of prior exposure to diphtheria toxoid or toxin. The results were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a single prebooster tetanus ELISA test or a modified Schick test for predicting which children with no records could be safely protected with only one DT booster dose instead of the primary series of three or four doses usually given to such children. Only 6 of the 34 subjects (18%) were totally without prior exposure to tetanus toxoid. Two of the six (6% of 33 subjects) appeared to mount a primary immune response to diphtheria toxoid as well. An initial ELISA titre of 0.01 IU/ml or lower correctly identified all six children needing a full series of tetanus toxoid (sensitivity for a primary immune response 100%) and falsely identified only 3 of 28 immune children as needing the series (specificity for immunity 89.3%). The modified Schick test appeared to have even greater accuracy for identifying children needing a full series of diphtheria toxoid. However, its use, entailing the costs of an extra nurse visit, would have prevented only seven more children from receiving an unnecessary full series of diphtheria toxoid than use of the baseline tetanus ELISA test alone.\r"

  ".W": "The functional efficacy of a conventional 7F (high flow) coronary catheter (hand injection) was compared with a 5F (high flow) catheter using hand and powered injection in 29 patients with ischemic heart disease. Patients were randomized to 5F or 7F catheters as the initial catheter. Consecutive comparative coronary angiograms were performed in the 15 degrees right anterior oblique (RAO) view using Judkin's technique. Visual diagnostic grade (Grade 1 = Diagnostic, Grade 2 = Equivocal, Grade 3 = Nondiagnostic), vessel filling, vessel density (using a densitometer and corrected for background), streaming, and dislodgement were all evaluated independently by two experienced angiographers with correlation of results. Mean diagnostic grade (1.31 +/- 0.48) was significantly better with the 7F compared to 5F (hand) 1.72 +/- 0.81 and 5F (power) 2.00 +/- 0.71 (P less than or equal to 0.05) for each. Streaming was seen in 55% of injections with 5F (hand) versus 88.5% with 5F (power) and 20.7% with 7F. Measured vessel density was not different for the two catheters. Coronary injection dislodgement occurred significantly more often with 5F power injections than with hand injection of either catheter. Finally, in 6 (30%) of 20 patients in which the 5F was randomly the second catheter used, the operator had to revert to the 7F catheter in order to obtain adequate images. In conclusion, angiographic quality is reduced with 5F catheters compared to 7F high flow in certain patients. Thus, to achieve optimal diagnostic angiograms, larger lumen catheters may be required during certain procedures initially begun with 5F catheters.\r"

The USCl probe TM catheter is an example of a low-profile catheter that has shown favorable applicability in dilating high-grade stenoses. Preliminary data indicate that this device has good trackability and an extremely low profile, which allows penetration of stenoses where other current low-profile catheters have failed.\r"

Control coronary angiography showed a patent vessel in all but one. Repeat angioplasty or bypass surgery was unnecessary. During 1 year mean follow-up time all patients remained free of symptoms. The reperfusion catheter is a safe and effective means of perfusing a coronary artery after failure of thrombolytic therapy and coronary angioplasty in cases where emergency bypass surgery is not performed because operative morbidity is expected to outweigh the benefit of myocardial salvage, or when it cannot be immediately organized.\r"

We provide documented evidence on the potential of cough-CPR to maintain adequate systemic arterial blood pressure and consciousness during malignant ventricular arrhythmias, including the longest cough-CPR episode (75-90 sec), with continuous hemodynamics recorded. Results in three patients disclose that 1) mean arterial pressure during cough-CPR was 47-66% of nonarrhythmic baseline at a cough rate of 38-46% of normal sinus rhythm heart rate; 2) mean arterial pressure during hypotensive ventricular tachycardia was 17-60 mm Hg higher with than without cough-CPR; 3) at comparable diastolic pressures (33 vs. 31 mm Hg), systolic arterial pressure during cough-CPR was 40 mm Hg higher than basic CPR; and 4) consciousness can be maintained with cough-CPR during prolonged malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Thus cough-CPR can be a valuable adjunct in maintaining patient stability while definitive therapy for the malignant ventricular arrhythmia is administered.\r"

The 525-line acquisition with digital upscan 1,023-line display had superior image quality compared with 525-line display.

Therefore, if the need for such catheters arises, the vessel must be left unprotected during attempts to recross the lesion. We describe a new technique using a combined balloon-on-a-wire system and an exchangeable guidewire, which permits the crossing and dilation of severely stenosed coronary arteries, while at the same time offering vessel protection and balloon catheter exchange.\r"

The ingestion of different microorganisms by blood granulocytes or monocytes may involve a variety of cell membrane recognition structures (e.g., immunoglobulin or complement receptors, lectin-like structures or other nonspecific binding sites). It is of interest to know which mechanism plays a prominent role in the management of a particular type of infection. Forty-three pathogenic bacterial suspensions were obtained from patients under mechanical ventilation at the onset of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections. They were coincubated with blood granulocytes from the same or other patients in the presence or absence of the corresponding serum. Phagocytosis and the oxidative burst were then assayed. We conclude the following: a) Substantial phagocytosis was found under serum-free conditions and the patients' sera did not dramatically enhance bacterial uptake during the first days after the onset of clinical symptoms. b) The phagocytes from an infected patient did not display any peculiar inability to bind to the bacteria that grew successfully in this subject. Hence, the occurrence of a particular infection might be dependent on a defect of intracellular killing of ingested pathogens or on the conditions of infection development.\r"

While various conditions affect the physiologic responses to atropine, little is known of the pharmacokinetics of this drug except under resting conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in mongrel dogs under two experimental conditions, moderate hemorrhage and hypothyroidism, to determine whether im absorption and elimination of atropine (0.05 mg/kg body weight) were affected by changes in hemodynamic or metabolic status. Using a randomized, crossover experimental design, it was found that during hypovolemia the mean volume of distribution was reduced by 22% (2.50 +/- 0.62 vs. 3.21 +/- 0.63 L/kg), with no changes in peak serum level, total atropine availability, elimination half-life, or whole-body clearance. Hypothyroidism was associated with a significant increase in peak serum atropine concentration (26.4 +/- 3.9 vs. 20.6 +/- 4.9 ng/ml) and drug bioavailability (48.5 +/- 8.8 vs. 30.0 +/- 10.7 ng/ml.h), while the clearance was reduced by 39% (426 +/- 34 vs. 696 +/- 187 ng/ml.min). These results suggest that atropine kinetics are not altered appreciably during moderate hemorrhage. In hypothyroidism, alterations in atropine pharmacokinetics may warrant modification of drug dose and frequency of administration.\r"

By comparison, in the previous 20 consecutive pediatric patients with cardiac arrest in which there was no response to two standard doses of epinephrine, none had ROSC.

Survival to hospital admission and to discharge was superior in the conventional CPR group vs. the experimental group (p less than .01). In a subset of adult cases whose causes of arrest were nontraumatic, survivor rates still favored the conventional CPR group: 33.5% of 337 vs. 22.5% of 365 (p less than .001). In limited cases where cardiac arrest was due to other heart disease, was vascular in origin or secondary to other natural diseases or from hypertensive cardiovascular disease, or when ECG on arrival was an agonal rhythm, survival was better (but not statistically significantly) in the experimental group. There were no statistically significant differences in the Glasgow coma scores between surviving patients in either group at 24 h post-hospital admission or discharge. It is concluded that survival in the SC-V CPR group was lower, likely reflecting a deleterious effect of the experimental technique of resuscitation. Also noted was that 14% of the control patients and 6% of the experimental patients survived with manual CPR alone.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic response after an iv loading dose of amiodarone for resistant supraventricular tachyarrhythmias was studied in ten critically ill patients receiving a catecholamine infusion for shock. A loading dose of amiodarone, 3.7 to 5.0 mg/kg, was infused over 2 h while the catecholamine infusion dose requirements were monitored. There was a significant decrease in heart rate (mean 16%, p less than .01), and an increase in stroke volume index (mean 29%, p less than .01) and left ventricular stroke work index (mean 34%, p less than .01). Cardiac index, oxygen availability index, and mean arterial pressure were not changed significantly. The reported adrenoreceptor antagonism of amiodarone did not change catecholamine dose requirements in this study. In nine of ten patients, sinus rhythm was achieved and maintained. The loading dose of amiodarone had no significant acute effect on plasma digoxin concentrations. Despite good arrhythmia control, mortality was high.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between cell metabolism and both hemodynamics and oxygen transport/utilization (VO2/DO2) pattern were evaluated intra and postoperatively in eight patients undergoing major valvular heart surgery with the aid of moderately hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Quadriceps femoris specimens were obtained by the needle biopsy technique for muscle ATP, ADP, AMP, phosphocreatine (PCr), creatine and lactate determination at anesthesia induction, after CPB, as well as in the ICU 18 h after surgery. Moreover, hemodynamic variables, oxygen transport and utilization indices, and plasma lactate were measured at the same intervals and throughout the CPB period. After CPB, muscle ATP and PCr contents were reduced (p less than .05) as compared to those of both pre-CPB patients and healthy control subjects; muscle and plasma lactate levels were increased (p less than .05). Mean VO2 and DO2 values measured during CPB significantly decreased (p less than .05), but VO2 reduction was proportionally greater than that of DO2 (-62% vs. -41%). No correlation was found between VO2 and DO2 at that time, but a significant relationship (p less than .05) was found at the end of CPB. A further decrease in muscle ATP and PCr levels was measured in the ICU, as muscle and plasma lactate levels were still elevated. At that time, VO2 and DO2 were not significantly different from pre-CPB values, but were significantly (p less than .05) correlated with each other.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After 2 h of tourniquet ischemia of the rats' hind limb, groups of animals were given iv lactated Ringer's solution (RL), serum albumin 5%, or varying MW fractions of biodegradable macromolecules of hydroxyethyl starch (HES), glycogen, and dextran. At the conclusion of the 24-h reperfusion period, the rat gastrocnemius muscles were collected. Water and K+ differences between the ischemic and control muscles were compared. Rats given a 100,000 to 300,000-dalton fraction of HES had significantly decreased water content (5.1 +/- 3.4%) when compared to rats receiving RL (8.3 +/- 2.2, p less than .01), less than 100,000 dalton HES (8.3 +/- 3.2, p less than .05), less than 300,000 glycogen (7.9 +/- 2.5, p less than .01), or dextran 150,000 (8.3 +/- 1.5, p less than .05). Rats given 100,000 to 300,000-dalton HES also had significantly higher ischemic muscle K+ content as compared to the nontourniquet control (difference 14.2 +/- 9.7 mEq/g) than rats receiving any of the other solutions (range 32.5 to 39.3) except the 300,000 to 1,000,000-dalton fraction of HES. Regression analysis comparison of K+ difference to the histologic evaluation of the muscles on the criteria of polymorphonuclear infiltration and interstitial edema (0, best; 3, worst) had a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = .73. Reduction of abnormally increased microvascular permeability may be accomplished by the iv use of appropriate sized biodegradable macromolecules.\r"

Strips of human atrial myocardium, discarded during cardiac surgery, were obtained from pediatric (2 to 18 months) and adult (40 to 60 yr) patients, and their electrically driven contractions were studied. The inotropic response of pediatric myocardium to phenylephrine was five times larger than that of the adult myocardium (p less than .05). The beta-agonist, isoproterenol, was also administered to the same myocardial specimens, and the average pediatric myocardial response was three times larger than that of the adult myocardium (p less than .05). Strips of right ventricular myocardium were obtained from four age groups of rats: 14 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 18 months, and exposed to phenylephrine. We demonstrated two age-related phenomena: a) a biphasic response with an early short negative inotropic effect preceding a sustained positive inotropic effect was registered in most of the rats aged 3 months and older, but in none of the youngest age group. b) A high mean positive inotropic response (211% of basal response) was generated in the youngest age group, whereas the oldest age group of rats showed only a slight response (8% of basal response, p less than .05). We conclude that loss of myocardial responsiveness to alpha and beta-agonist with increasing age is a prominent feature. The pattern of the ventricular responsiveness to phenylephrine also changes during aging as it turns from monophasic to biphasic.\r"

Some strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus produce a mucoid extracellular material known as slime or glycocalyx that helps bacteria adhere to the surface of biomaterials. We examined by scanning and transmission electron microscope the surface of 29 polyvinyl ETT removed from neonatal patients, and ten unused ETT. Multiple surface irregularities were found in the unused tubes. These irregularities were most prominent in the tip and around the side hole. Amorphous material containing slime-producing bacteria was found on 29 ETT removed from patients. Tubes in place for longer times had greater areas of surface covered; the amorphous material was more concentrated in the areas where surface irregularities were most prominent. No clinical correlation with pulmonary nosocomial infection was established.\r"

The reliability of various RAP interval values in predicting optimal WP was then studied in these patients.

  ".W": "Epidemiologic and clinical evidence has suggested a possible association between anal cancer and human papillomavirus (HPV) types that are known to be associated with cervical and other genital cancers. Using Southern blot and dot blot analysis, the authors examined 45 primary anal malignancies for HPV DNA types 6, 11, 16, and 18. HVP 16, DNA was detected in 23 of 41 (56 percent) anal squamous-cell carcinomas (SCC) and in the lymph-node metastases of two of these tumors. In addition, HPV 18 DNA was detected in 2/41 (5 percent) anal SCCs. Anal SCC contained no detectable HPV 6 or 11 DNA. The remaining four primary anal malignancies were not squamous carcinomas and did not contain any detectable HPV DNA. Nonmalignant anal epithelium and malignant rectal mucosa obtained from surgical patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy and abdominoperineal excision of the rectum did not contain any detectable HPV DNA. HPV 16 DNA in anal cancer was predominantly integrated into the host cell DNA. In situ hybridization was used to demonstrate that HPV 16 DNA in anal SCC tissues is confined to the nuclei of carcinoma cells. The results of this investigation closely parallel similar studies of cervical cancer and lend support to the concept of the involvement of HPV 16 and 18 in the development of anal and genital squamous-cell carcinoma.\r"

Four hundred thirteen (97 percent) of the colonoscopic examinations correlated with the pathologic specimen, but, in 16 cases (3 percent), lesions were missed. In total, 17 adenomatous polyps and 3 cancers were found in the surgical specimens that were not documented at colonoscopy. Eighteen patients had total preoperative colonoscopy and total abdominal colectomy, which makes for a reliable model to judge the accuracy of colonoscopy. In these 18 patients, 17 of the pathologic specimens correlated with the endoscopic findings, which yields an accuracy rate of 94 percent. Blind areas in the colon, plus misjudgment that the scope had reached the cecum, are responsible for the majority of colonoscopic errors.\r"

As a group, incontinent patients usually exhibit lower pressure profiles than do continent patients regardless of age and gender; however, both the resting pressure of the internal anal sphincter and the voluntary contractile pressure of the external anal sphincter are decreased with age, and both are lowered in women compared with men. Sphincter relaxation and perception of gastrointestinal events are not altered in incontinent patients, and they are not different between men and women or between elderly and younger patients.\r"

In all of these patients, endoscopic studies revealed multiple or innumerable small (less than 4 mm in diameter) polypoid lesions, all recognizable as whitish, sessile elevations. Histologic findings of the biopsy specimens from the polypoid lesions showed tubular adenoma, with or without lymphoid hyperplasia, in nine (50 percent), but only lymphoid hyperplasia in the other nine patients. Colonic metaplasia was present in the adjacent ileal mucosa in 3 patients with ileal adenomas. The incidence (83 percent) of ileal adenomas detected 113 to 249 months after colectomy was higher than that (33 percent) found 7 to 90 months after surgery. In view of these results, endoscopy and biopsy of the terminal ileum, as well as the retained rectum, should be done periodically for postcolectomy patients with this disease.\r"

Penetrating abdominal trauma index, associated injuries, length of operative procedure, wounding agent, length of hospital stay, method of treatment, and septic complications were evaluated. Twenty-eight patients were treated with colostomy at the site of injury: five with diverting colostomy proximal to repair, 30 with primary repair (either single or multiple injuries), and two with exteriorization and early drop back. Overall septic morbidity was 15 of 65 (23 percent) patients. No statistically significant difference was found in morbidity between colostomy, 9 of 33 (27 percent), and primary repair, 6 of 30 (20 percent). The two patients with exteriorized repairs had no morbidity. No deaths were reported among the 65 patients studied. Thirty-two of the 33 (97 percent) colostomies were later closed with morbidity in 7 of 32 (22 percent). The mean length of stay for primary repair patients was 10.3 +/- 2.8 days and for colostomy patients, 25.7 +/- 3.8 days, counting days for both initial and colostomy closure admissions (P less than .05). Colostomy was not mandated by anatomic location or number of colonic injuries, circumference of colonic wall involved, presence of fecal contamination, or involvement of mesenteric blood supply. This study indicates that primary repair does not carry an increased risk of septic complications and saves the patient the significant risk and increased hospital stay of colostomy closure. Prospective studies addressing this area are indicated.\r"

  ".W": "For patients needing proctocolectomy, there are several alternatives available today for the previously dominating conventional ileostomy. Currently, the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis attracts major interest. Various reservoir procedures have been proposed, but the ideal reservoir design is still debated. The double-folded ileal reservoir (Kock pouch) has a large capacity, low pressure, and is expandable. It is successfully used for the construction of continent ileostomies, continent urostomies, and for replacing the urinary bladder by connecting the reservoir to the urethra. In view of these facts, it was decided to interpose the Kock pouch between the ileum and the anus after colectomy and mucosal proctectomy in a small number of patients, and to study and evaluate its merits in this position. Six consecutive patients formed the study group. Three months after ileostomy closure the stool frequency was 4 every 24-hours, range 3 to 5, and remained so during the follow-up period. All patients could sleep through the night without bowel movements or soiling. None of the patients used pads. The capacity of the reservoir increased from a mean of 100 ml preoperatively to 550 ml one year after ileostomy closure. The large reservoir capacity and the low pressure can explain the good functional results.\r"

Six patients (26 percent) showed aneuploidy (abnormal DNA stemlines) and 1 had possible aneuploidy. All 3 patients with high-grade dysplasia showed aneuploidy (or possible aneuploidy) preceding or coexisting with the severe dysplastic changes. In 1 of these patients, the presence of aneuploidy preceded two diploid carcinomas. One patient was found to have had aneuploidy for seven years without evident malignant transformation. Further prospective studies are necessary to determine the value of DNA analysis in relation to morphologic examination in surveillance of patients with ulcerative colitis.\r"

This procedure has the negative aspects of requiring a general anesthetic and leaves the infirm patient with a stoma that they cannot easily attend to. Ablation of tumor by Nd-Yag laser has been available for several years, with passage of the laser fiber through a colonoscope. To evaluate the role of laser photocoagulation in the palliation of colorectal tumors or benign strictures, the authors summarized their initial experience, trying to define the indications, various methods of treatment, and complication rate in these patients. This technique is difficult to perform and has the added risk of intestinal perforation but does obviate anesthetic and surgical risks. Seven patients with recurrent metastatic colorectal obstruction, three patients with benign colonic strictures, and two patients with large villous tumors were treated with Nd-Yag laser passed via the colonoscope. The mean age was 71 years (range, 52 to 86 years). Five patients received sedatives only, six patients received epidural anesthetic, and one had a general anesthetic. The average total energy used was 3702 joules on noncontact fibers, and the average number of pulses was 126. Distance of the lesion from the anal margin ranged from 0.5 to 30 cm. Ten of twelve tumors were within 15 cm of the dentate line. In the most distal lesions, manual debulking with biopsy forceps facilitated the laser treatment. Symptomatic relief was achieved in all patients. One patient required a colostomy one month after treatment because of incontinence. Another patient needed a resection of a benign stricture after three laser treatments. Other than one case of microperforation, treated conservatively with antibiotics, no other complications occurred and there was no mortality. The authors believed that the Nd-Yag laser plays a specific role in the treatment of high-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "The extent of resection was assessed in 45 temporal lobectomies for medically intractable epilepsy with mapped temporal lobe foci. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the coronal plane was used to quantify the extent of resection of superior lateral, inferior lateral, basal, and medial structures, including the amygdalohippocampal complex. A new 20-compartment model of the temporal lobe was used for this assessment. Blinded interobserver variability was minimal. Intraoperative measurements and maps routinely overestimated the actual extent of resection, especially of medial structures. One year after surgery, 70% of patients remained seizure-free (except for auras). Seizure-free outcome was accomplished despite varying degrees of resection, but was more likely achieved with more extensive resections in all compartments. Among patients with mesiobasal foci, seizure-free outcome correlated significantly with extent of resection of amygdalohippocampal complex. We conclude that assessment of extent of resection by postoperative MRI provides an objective basis of evaluating outcome after temporal lobectomy. It allows a rational approach to understanding of operative failures and is potentially useful in comparing efficacy of various surgical approaches.\r"

The Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) was administered preoperatively and postoperatively. Postoperative decrease in percentage of retention of verbal material correlated with extent of medial resection of left temporal lobe, whereas decrease in percentage of retention of visual material correlated with extent of medial resection of right temporal lobe. These correlations approached but did not reach statistical significance. Extent of resection correlated significantly with the presence of visual field defect on perimetry testing but not with severity, denseness, or congruity of the defect. There was no correlation between postoperative dysphasia and extent of resection in any quadrant. Assessment of extent of resection after temporal lobectomy allows a rational interpretation of postoperative neurologic deficits in light of functional anatomy of the temporal lobe.\r"

Within the single NREM stages, phase A consists of clusters of phasic events associated with transient arousal activation, whereas phase B is represented by the periodic reappearance of the EEG background and reflects a rebound inhibitory condition. The polysomnograms of 10 subjects with a wide age range and affected by primary generalized epilepsy displayed significant differences (all at p less than 0.01) between the spike indexes (S-W/min) of CAP (2.9) and NCAP (1.3), of phase A (7.4) and phase B (0.3), and of NCAP and phase B. For distribution of S-W, a significant prevalence of EEG paroxysms was detected during CAP as compared with NCAP (68 vs. 32%, p less than 0.001), and 93% of all the interictal bursts that occurred in CAP occurred in phase A (p less than 0.001). Our data stress the arousal-dependent influence of CAP and NCAP on modulation of generalized epileptic mechanisms during sleep.\r"

Mean follow-up from first seizure to the last contact with the patient was 51 months (SEM 8.17 months). Ictal semiology was characterized by three types of seizures: simple PS with motor signs, complex partial seizures (CPS) with impairment of consciousness at onset followed by motor manifestations, and CPS with motor activity at onset. Versive phenomena, oroalimentary automatisms, and vegetative manifestations were frequently associated. The topography of the ictal discharges and the elementary ictal events, suggested involvement of the temporal lobe and somatomotor area. The diagnosis of PS can be difficult during the first year of life since some patients beginning with generalized seizures may evolve into partial seizures. The prognosis is guarded with regard to seizure persistence, but the neurologic outcome is better as a whole than is reported for infancy-onset epilepsies.\r"

The EEG was initially characterized by a hemihypsarrhythmia and afterward, over the malformed hemisphere, by a rather high-frequency background activity associated with almost continuous transients of spikes, sharp waves, and spike and waves that progressively involved the contralateral hemisphere. Hemispherectomy was performed in two children with sudden and complete recovery from seizures and improvement in psychomotor development. Macroscopic examination was consistent with the computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing pachygyria and poorly represented white matter. Histologic examination showed the characteristic absence of cortical neuronal layering, and the presence of giant neurons, neuronal heterotopias, and gliosis. For hemispherectomy to be successful, we believe prolonged EEG monitoring is needed to verify that no seizures are originating in the normal hemisphere.\r"

  ".W": "The steroid content of 72 follicular fluids (FF) obtained from 42 women subjected to ovulation induction with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue D-Trp6 and human menopausal gonadotropin was studied in terms of the evolution of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) results. The FF were classified into several categories based on oocyte evolution. Individual values of FF estrone and estradiol (E2), as well as androstenedione and testosterone could not be correlated with ET outcome. However, FF progesterone (P) levels for follicles leading to pregnancy were significantly lower when compared with those in the other categories. The correlation between the E2/P ratio and E2 permitted the definition of a band wherein IVF-ET outcome was successful and enabled the characterization of different functional follicular maturational states.\r"
