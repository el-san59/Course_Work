The efficacy and safety of prophylactically administered Lactinex (culture of L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus) was compared with placebo for the prevention of amoxicillin-induced diarrhea in pediatric patients. Lactinex or placebo was administered four times a day for ten days to coincide with the antibiotic therapy.

  ".W": "Using a pharmacy intervention form, we measured the influence that university-based pharmacy educational personnel had on the pharmacy department's drug costs and on patient charges over a three-month period. A total of 278 interventions were made; 88.8 percent were implemented. Implemented interventions decreased drug costs by $1661.99 and decreased patient charges by $5938.37. The average implemented intervention decreased drug cost by $6.73 and patient cost by $24.04. Regardless of economic benefits, 218 of the 247 implemented interventions were considered to have positive clinical effects on patient care. Educational personnel were responsible for generating $6028.27 of fee revenues to the pharmacy department through generation of pharmacokinetic drug dosing consults. We conclude that the educational programs provided by the pharmacy department through affiliation with a college of pharmacy directly contributed $7690.26 to the pharmacy department in the form of cost-avoided dollars and revenue generation over a three-month period. The provision of educational services by a hospital pharmacy department results in financial rewards as well as other benefits that have been previously described.\r"

The authors examine peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. More than 90% of these cells bound T-lymphocyte specific antibodies, failed to bind B-lymphocyte specific antibodies, had rearranged T-cell receptor beta-chain genes and had retained immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in the germline configuration. Despite these T-lineage markers, the majority of these cells had rearranged kappa immunoglobulin light chain genes. This provides the first conclusive evidence for rearranged kappa genes in malignant T-lineage cells and warns that gene rearrangement studies alone cannot indicate tumor cell lineage. To detect T-lineage cells that rearrange immunoglobulin genes, multiple immunophenotypic and genotypic parameters must be evaluated. These cells may provide important models to study how normal and malignant cells rearrange lymphocyte receptor genes.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of an antiulcer drug, colloidal bismuth subcitrate (De-Nol), on the proteolytic activity of pepsin toward gastric mucus and salivary epidermal growth factor was investigated. Samples of pig gastric mucus and mouse epidermal growth factor were incubated with pepsin in the absence and in the presence of De-Nol, and the released alpha-amino acid residues were quantified. Results of analysis revealed that, in the absence of De-Nol, the apparent Km value of pepsin toward gastric mucus was 1.4 g/L and that towards epidermal growth factor 120 microM. Introduction of De-Nol to the incubation mixtures led, in both cases, to reduction of the rates of proteolysis. With gastric mucus, the rate of proteolysis inhibition was proportional to the De-Nol concentration up to 1 x 10(-2) g/L, at which point a 54% reduction in mucus proteolysis occurred, whereas, with epidermal growth factor, this concentration of De-Nol caused nearly 52% inhibition in the rate of proteolysis. The apparent Ki value for peptic degradation of gastric mucus in the presence of De-Nol was 2.1 x 10(-4) g/L and that for peptic degradation of epidermal growth factor 1.8 x 10(-2) g/L. The results suggest that among the beneficial effects of colloidal bismuth subcitrate on ulcer healing is its ability to interfere with peptic digestion of the protective gastric mucus coat and of such important bioactive protein as epidermal growth factor.\r"

Proton beam radiotherapy was applied to the lesion, since surgery was contraindicated. The total dose to the stomach lesion was 61 Gy in 7 wk. The tumor on the stomach regressed, with flattening of the round wall of the lesion. The reactive changes of the proton beam radiotherapy, based on the histopathological examination, revealed extensive tumor necrosis and sparing of vital architecture of normal tissue around the irradiated tumor tissue. Only small clusters of vital or devitalized tumor cells with less than approximately 5% of the whole tumor tissue remained after treatment. We suggest that a high dose of radiation delivered by well-defined proton field could result in an improved therapeutic outcome without undue risk of injury to normal tissue.\r"

The gastrostomy tube itself was patent, and the end still protruded into the lumen of the stomach so that tube feeding was not impaired. Endoscopy, in combination with passage of Savary dilators over a guidewire, was safely used to remove the gastrostomy tube and buried bumper. We recommend this approach in patients with the \"buried bumper\" syndrome to prevent continued tube migration into the gastric and abdominal walls.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Recombinant gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma) inhibits IgE synthesis in vitro by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). These data suggest a role for rIFN-gamma in the treatment of patients with severe atopic dermatitis (AD) and elevated IgE levels. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of rIFN-gamma treatment on IgE production in patients with AD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients with chronic severe AD were treated with rIFN-gamma. In part I of the study, 14 patients were treated with daily subcutaneous injections at three successive dose levels (0.01 mg/m2, 0.05 mg/m2, and 0.1 mg/m2) for 5 days with 2 days off between each dose level. In part II, eight patients received rIFN-gamma at 0.05 mg/m2, daily for 6 weeks. One patient from part I and eight patients from part II of the study received three times per week maintenance thereby for up to 14 months. Prior to and at selected times during and after treatment, the clinical and immunologic status of the patients was assessed. RESULTS: In part I, spontaneous de novo IgE synthesis by PBMC was inhibited in 10 patients receiving rIFN-gamma at 0.01 mg/m2 (p = 0.038) and in nine at 0.1 mg/m2 (p = 0.066). There was no reduction of serum IgE levels at any of the three dose levels. Total clinical severity showed improvement at each dose level (p less than 0.04) with worsening 3 days after discontinuation of treatment. In part II, there was no significant inhibition of spontaneous IgE synthesis by PBMC nor was there any reduction of serum IgE. Nevertheless, there was a progressive and significant reduction (p less than 0.01) in total clinical severity over the 6 weeks of daily rIFN-gamma with a sustained improvement during maintenance therapy. CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot study suggest that rIFN-gamma may be efficacious in the treatment of AD and that further clinical trials are warranted.\r"

This study compares the two methods with regard to multiple objective end points of performance, therapy, and outcome in a highly matched case-control fashion. The intravascular approach is better on almost every level. More surviving infants who are in better condition at a mature gestation and whose mothers have fewer complications and sequelae are the result. Whereas intraperitoneal transfusion should not be abandoned altogether, it is a second-line procedure used only in very limited circumstances. Intravascular fetal transfusion offers realistic prognosis for intact survival at virtually any extreme of alloimmune disease.\r"

Studies suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies may inhibit the production of prostacyclin by vascular tissues. We incubated sera from women with moderate to high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies with primary human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures. Intact confluent, subconfluent, hydrogen peroxide-damaged, and mechanically damaged endothelial cell monolayers were evaluated for the production of the prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in the presence of sera that were positive and negative for antiphospholipid antibodies. All sera were assayed for baseline concentrations of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha before incubation with endothelial monolayers. Additionally, the extent of binding of antiphospholipid antibodies to intact and damaged endothelium was studied by immunofluorescent techniques and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results indicate that prostacyclin production is not impaired by sera containing antiphospholipid antibodies, regardless of the condition of the endothelium. Further, we were unable to demonstrate binding of immunoglobulin from sera containing antiphospholipid antibodies to intact or damaged endothelium. However, the baseline concentration of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was nearly fourfold higher in sera containing antiphospholipid antibodies. The finding of elevated baseline serum concentrations of prostacyclin metabolite in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies suggests a condition of long-term stimulation or altered metabolism of prostacyclin.\r"

  ".W": "Using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for cross-reactive idiotypes (CRIs) associated with human monoclonal IgM autoantibodies, we examined 57 biopsy specimens that previously had been noted to have immunohistologic features of CD5-positive B-cell small lymphocytic (SL) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Twenty-five lymphoma specimens were noted to be from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Eight of thirty-four (24%) immunoglobulin (Ig) kappa light-chain expressing lymphomas reacted with 17.109, a MAb specific for a major CRI encoded by a conserved Ig kappa variable region gene (Vk gene) of the VkIIIb sub-subgroup. All 17.109-reactive tissues and two 17.109-negative specimens were recognized by another MAb specific for VkIIIb framework determinant(s). Seven of all fifty-six (13%) Ig-expressing tumors bound G6, a MAb specific for an autoantibody heavy-chain-associated CRI that is encoded by a conserved antibody heavy chain variable region gene(s) (VHgene) of the VH1 subgroup. All seven G6-positive lymphomas and two G6-negative tumors reacted with Cc1, another MAb specific for a rheumatoid factor heavy-chain-associated CRI. A third autoantibody-heavy-chain-associated CRI, termed Lc1, was expressed by seven (13%) other lymphomas. Finally, a fourth MAb specific for RF heavy-chain-associated CRI, named B6, detected two additional tumors. The expression frequencies of autoantibody-associated CRIs among SL NHL patients without peripheral lymphocytosis did not differ from those noted among patients with CLL but were significantly higher than those observed among patients with NHL of follicular center-cell origin. These data imply that the malignant B cells of patients with either CD5-positive B-cell SL NHL or CLL express a restricted set of Ig V genes that have not substantially diversified from the germline DNA.\r"

  ".U": "90225099\r", 
  ".W": "Activated monocytes forming intravascular clumps in the veins of most organs appeared in LEW rats after a 3-day intravenous treatment with recombinant rat gamma interferon. Phenotyping in situ and in cytospot preparations of perfusates revealed that the cells coexpressed the rat monocyte/macrophage antigen ED1 and class II MHC molecules. In addition, most cells reacted with a rat CD11b antibody and weakly expressed determinants detected by the W3/13 and Ox22 reagents. Minor fractions of the activated monocytes were positive for rat CD4 and the Ox2 and ED3 determinants. Cell proliferation was assessed by double staining for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation and phenotypic markers. Of the ED 1-positive class II-positive cells, 80% were labeled with BrdUrd after 3 days of combined infusion with gamma interferon. Pulse labeling for 30 minutes revealed 8% BrdUrd-positive intravascular ED 1-positive class II-positive monocytes in situ on day 3 of treatment, which contrasted with almost-absent labeling of this cell population in normal LEW rats. It is concluded that interferon not only promotes activation but also intravascular division of monocytes or their immediate precursors. Interestingly, cells of identical morphology and phenotype were observed in the vasculature of rats during lethal graft-versus-host reactions. Activated monocytes may thus contribute to the pathologic consequences of cytokine treatment and severe systemic immune reactions in vivo.\r"

Lithium produced a robust reversal of carbamazepine-induced leukopenia, increasing WBCs, predominantly neutrophils, to levels significantly above placebo baseline values. The combination produced additive antithyroidal effects, resulting in greater decreases in T4 and free T4 than with carbamazepine alone; the addition of lithium was associated with the emergence of a modestly higher TSH level. The authors discuss clinical and theoretical implications of these findings.\r"

The leukocyte esterase test has the lowest average cost-per-cure ($51) compared with direct-smear fluorescent antibody ($192) and culture ($414). Compared with the DFA, we estimate that the leukocyte esterase test saves over $9,727 per cohort of 1,000 sexually active adolescent males screened. Sensitivity analyses show the leukocyte esterase test results in a lower cost-per-cure and lower overall costs (per cohort) than culture and direct-smear fluorescent antibody at any prevalence of C. trachomatis infection, and lower overall costs (per cohort) than no screening at prevalences above 21 percent.\r"

Tuberculosis patients may have strong antibodies against it, and their peripheral blood mononuclear cells respond to it with gamma-interferon production and lymphocyte proliferation. Antigen 85 is actively secreted into the culture medium during culture in vitro and is known to bind human fibronectin. A double-antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantification of antigen 85 is described. A mouse monoclonal antibody, HYT27, was used as capture antibody in the assay. HYT27 was characterized in crossed immunoelectrophoresis and found to bind all three components of the antigen 85 complex. By radioimmunoassay, HYT27 was found to bind equally well to antigens 85A and 85B. In the ELISA assay, a rabbit anti-antigen 85 antiserum was used in the second antibody layer. The specificity of the assay was tested using several different antigen preparations. The purified BCG 85A and 85B components were compared, and there was a 10 times lower sensitivity for antigen 85A due to weaker rabbit antibodies toward this component. The purified components MPT44 and MPT59 from M. tuberculosis H37Rv were compared with the components of BCG and found to correspond to BCG 85A and 85B, respectively. Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium avium both contained partially identical antigens. Small amounts of antigen 85 were detected in Mycobacterium leprae sonicates. Detecting antigen 85 by sensitive methods may be of great value in the early diagnosis of mycobacterial disease.\r"

The aim was to identify factors that may contribute to the development of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea were excluded from the study. Detailed lifetime histories of smoking, alcohol, and snoring were obtained from all patients together with measurements of lung function and of upper airway size. Thirty-three patients with FEV1 less than 1.5 L were studied, of whom 19 were eucapnic and 14 were hypercapnic. Both groups had a similar degree of chronic airflow limitation and similar lung volumes and DLCO. The hypercapnic group had more hypopneas and desaturated more severely during sleep. The greatest differences between the groups were in their alcohol consumptions, snoring histories, and upper airway dimensions. The eucapnic patients were characterized by lower lifetime alcohol intake, minimal snoring, and large upper airway size. In contrast, the hypercapnic patients were characterized by excessive lifetime alcohol consumption, habitual snoring over many years, and a small upper airway size. Our findings suggest that chronic, heavy alcohol use and upper airway dysfunction are important factors in the development of hypercapnic respiratory failure.\r"

For the first 4 days of study, all patients received bronchodilating aerosols and chest physiotherapy but no antibiotics. During this time, the patients showed significant improvement in mean FVC, FEV1, and maximal midexpiratory flow rate (FEF25-75). In 12 of 13 trials, the patients showed no significant increases in the density of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during these first 4 days. In these 12 trials, the patients were stratified by their initial FVC and randomized to receive either parenteral tobramycin and ticarcillin (n = 7) or placebo (n = 5), in addition to continued aerosol and chest physiotherapy. In the remaining trial, the patient had a significant rise in the density of P. aeruginosa and was assigned to the antibiotic group. During the next 14 days of therapy, the antibiotic group showed significantly (p less than 0.01) greater reductions in log10 colony-forming units (cfu) of P. aeruginosa per gram of sputum and greater increases in FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75 than did the placebo group. The degree of decrease in log10 cfu P. aeruginosa/g sputum correlated significantly (p less than 0.001) with the degree of improvement in FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was no evidence of contractile fatigue or alterations in glycogen or lactate concentrations in the diaphragm of unbound spontaneously breathing animals. With thoracoabdominal binding, there was a fall in maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdimax) and the ratio of diaphragmatic force divided by neural input (Pdi/Edi ratio); there was no change in diaphragm glycogen, but there was a significant rise in lactate. In the bound and phrenic-paced animals Pdimax and Pdi/Edi ratio fell, and there was significant glycogen depletion and lactate accumulation. There was a significant correlation between diaphragm function and the levels of diaphragm glycogen and lactate at the point of respiratory failure. We conclude that (1) respiratory failure induced by incremental inspiratory threshold loading was not associated with either contractile fatigue of the diaphragm or diaphragmatic biochemical changes in unbound spontaneously breathing animals, (2) when mechanisms that preserve diaphragmatic function are circumvented by phrenic pacing and/or thoracoabdominal binding, diaphragm fatigue and biochemical changes occur, and (3) there is a significant relationship between in vivo evidence of contractile fatigue of the diaphragm and diaphragmatic glycogen depletion and lactate accumulation.\r"

Hyperosmolar activation was examined, and both cell types were shown to release histamine but little or no leukotriene C4 or D4 (LTC4/D4) and, in the case of mast cells, little or no prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). In addition, hyperosmolar buffers were capable of preventing the formation of LTC4/LTD4 in basophils stimulated by anti-IgE when added simultaneously, or 2, 5, or 10 min after, the addition of anti-IgE. Catabolism of PGD2 and LTC4/D4 was not increased. Experiments with cell lysates demonstrated that intracellular formation, rather than secretion, was arrested in hyperosmolar buffers. We conclude that this selective inhibition of mediator production is a unique response of mast cells and basophils to osmotic activation. Although the mechanism of this selective cellular response is not clear, these in vitro observations have important therapeutic and pathophysiologic implications for the airway response to hyperosmolar stimuli.\r"

CD4+ lymphocytes from patients with acute severe asthma showed significant increases in the expression of three surface proteins associated with lymphocyte activation (interleukin-2 receptor [IL-2R], class II histocompatibility antigen [HLA-DR], and \"very late activation\" antigen [VLA-1]) as compared with those from normal control subjects. In contrast, CD8 cells were devoid of IL-2R and VLA-1, in both patients with acute severe asthma and control subjects, and the expression of HLA-DR on these cells was not increased above that of control subjects.

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of high doses of beta-ser-interferon (recombinant human 17-serine beta-interferon) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and Kaposi sarcoma. DESIGN: A nonrandomized, controlled trial of two high-dose regimens of beta-ser-interferon administered until tumor progression, toxicity, or an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infection occurred. SETTING: An AIDS treatment clinic at a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: A sequential sample of 39 patients with biopsy-proven, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma were enrolled during a 2-year period. Thirty-eight patients were evaluable for response. Most patients (35 of 38) had one or more of the following clinical or laboratory predictors for a poor response to interferon therapy: HIV p24 antigenemia, low CD4 cell numbers, elevated beta 2-microglobulin levels, previous opportunistic infections, or previous systemic chemotherapy. INTERVENTIONS: Beta-ser-interferon was self-administered subcutaneously at home 5 days per week. The first 21 patients used 90 million IU/d, and the remainder used 180 million IU/d. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Six patients (16%) had a major clinical response, and 15 (39%) had stable disease for prolonged periods. Toxicities were minimal; the major toxicity was a skin reaction at the injection site. The HIV p24 antigen level declined more than 50% in 8 of the 19 patients with initial values greater than 50 pg/mL. Antiretroviral activity and antitumor activity were seen only in patients with normal initial beta 2-microglobulin levels. Minimal changes were seen in CD4 and CD8 cell numbers. Only 1 patient had an opportunistic infection while on study, but five other patients developed infections after treatment was discontinued for an incidence of six opportunistic infections in 285 patient-observation months. CONCLUSIONS: The high doses of interferon did not improve the major response rate in patients with poor-prognosis, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma. There was, however, a suggestion of antiviral activity in patients with normal beta 2-microglobulin levels and a decrease in the expected incidence of opportunistic infections.\r"

Administration of rat recombinant interferon-gamma markedly augmented both myelin-induced and T-cell line-mediated experimental autoimmune neuritis. Conversely, in vivo application of a monoclonal antibody to interferon-gamma suppressed the disease. Clinical and electrophysiological findings were corroborated by semiquantitative morphometric analysis. Mechanisms responsible for the enhancing effects of interferon-gamma include upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression in the nerve lesion, increased cellular influx of T cells and macrophages, and heightened macrophage activity with enhanced release of toxic oxygen species. These observations establish a pivotal role of the cytokine interferon-gamma in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system.\r"

To begin to understand the molecular events that contribute to cell proliferation in these benign tumors, we have analyzed extracts of neurofibromas to determine whether they contain mitogens for Schwann cells or fibroblasts, or both. Schwann cell and fibroblast mitogens are present in neurofibroma extracts. All the neurofibromas analyzed contain a Schwann cell mitogen similar to a neuronal cell surface molecule known to stimulate Schwann cell proliferation during normal development; this mitogen also stimulates fibroblast proliferation. Basic fibroblast growth factor is present in 60% of tumors evaluated. Accumulation of mitogenic substances may contribute to the growth of neurofibromas.\r"

Tissue cages were implanted into guinea pigs and subsequently infected (100% rate) with 10(2) or more CFU of Staphylococcus aureus Wood 46. When a single dose of 30 mg of fleroxacin or vancomycin per kg of body weight was administered intraperitoneally, bactericidal levels of the antimicrobial agent were found in the tissue cage fluid after 3 h (when guinea pigs were inoculated with S. aureus) and during the next 24 h. Either fleroxacin or vancomycin successfully prevented experimental infection in all tissue cages challenged by 10(2) CFU of S. aureus Wood 46. When tissue cages were challenged with 10(4) CFU of S. aureus Wood 46, however, fleroxacin was more effective than vancomycin (P less than 0.05) in reducing colony counts below the detection limit of 10 CFU/ml in the inflammatory fluid of all tissue cages during the initial 48 h. In contrast to their initially different actions, the effects of the antibiotics were similar after 7 days, mostly because bacterial regrowth occurred more frequently in the fleroxacin-treated than in the vancomycin-treated tissue cages. These data show that experimental infections of subcutaneous tissue cages are a useful model for studying the prophylaxis of foreign body infections with antimicrobial agents.\r"

  ".U": "90225732\r", 
  ".W": "The renal handling of fleroxacin was studied by renal clearance and stop-flow techniques in rabbits and dogs and by analyzing the pharmacokinetics with and without probenecid in humans. In rabbits the excretion ratios (fleroxacin intrinsic renal clearance/glomerular filtration rate) were greater than unity (2.01) without probenecid and were decreased to a value below unity (0.680) with probenecid. In dogs, on the other hand, the excretion ratios were less than unity (0.608 and 0.456) both without and with probenecid, and so were not affected by probenecid. This fact suggested that fleroxacin was excreted into urine by both glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion in rabbits, but only by glomerular filtration in dogs, accompanied by partial renal tubular reabsorption in both species; these mechanisms were also supported by stop-flow experiments. In humans probenecid treatment induced increases in the elimination half-life and area under the serum concentration-time curve and decreases in apparent serum clearance, renal clearance, and urinary recovery of fleroxacin. The excretion ratio without probenecid was 1.13, which was significantly decreased to 0.750 with probenecid. These results indicated that both renal tubular secretion and reabsorption contributed to renal excretion of fleroxacin in humans. The contribution of tubular secretion was species dependent and was extensive in rabbits, minimal in dogs, and moderate in humans. Renal tubular reabsorption was commonly found in every species. The long elimination half-life of fleroxacin in humans might be explained by its small total serum clearance and small renal clearance, which are attributed to less tubular secretion and more tubular reabsorption.\r"

Combinations of 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides plus dextran sulfate exerted similar synergistic antiviral effects without concomitant increases in toxicities. When sCD4 and dextran sulfate were combined, apparent antagonism was observed. We confirmed that no combination of sCD4 plus 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine, 2',3'-dideoxyinosine, or 2',3'-dideoxycytidine significantly increased the inhibitory effect on colony formation of human myeloid-monocytic bone marrow cells in vitro at the concentrations used in this study.

Crude cell walls from noninduced cells or from induced cells treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate to remove the inducible proteins were shown to bind vancomycin, in contrast to cell walls containing the cytoplasmic membrane-associated induced proteins, which did not bind vancomycin. Cytoplasmic membranes from vancomycin-induced cells did not inactivate (bind) vancomycin or teicoplanin, but they could protect the glycopeptides from being bound to the synthetic pentapeptide. This protection could be competitively abolished by D-alanyl-D-alanine. A decrease in glycopeptide binding to the pentapeptide was observed in a time-dependent fashion after treatment of the pentapeptide with the cytoplasmic membranes from induced cells. We hypothesize that the inducible proteins are responsible for glycopeptide resistance due to the binding to, and subsequent enzymatic modification of, the pentapeptide precursor of peptidoglycan, which is considered to be the natural target of glycopeptides.\r"

All isolates were verified as the same strain by DNA probe. MICs of all quinolones tested were 16- to 32-fold higher for the posttherapy isolates; nonquinolone MICs were unchanged. The isolates were compared by analyses of outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide composition, antimicrobial susceptibilities, measurement of accumulation of ciprofloxacin, and inhibition of DNA gyrase activity by ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid. No significant changes in outer membrane proteins or ciprofloxacin accumulation were observed; however, both posttherapy isolates lost the long chain O-polysaccharide component of lipopolysaccharide. Preparations of DNA gyrase from the quinolone-resistant posttherapy isolates were 16- to 32-fold less sensitive to inhibition of supercoiling by ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid than was gyrase from the pretherapy isolate. Inhibition studies on combinations of heterologous gyrase subunits showed that decreased inhibition was conferred by the resistant gyrase A subunits. Thus, acquired resistance to ciprofloxacin in this strain involved an alteration in the A subunit of DNA gyrase and was associated with changes in lipopolysaccharide.\r"

Four of these had MBCs of penicillin equal to 2 to 4 x the MIC, and six exhibited a paradoxical response to penicillin, i.e., the bactericidal activity of the antibiotic had a concentration optimum at 2 to 4 x the MIC and decreased significantly at concentrations above this. We found that the paradoxical response to penicillin was an intrinsic and stable property of a strain, but that its phenotypic expression was not homogeneous; only a fraction of the cell population that died at low concentrations was able to survive at high penicillin concentrations. The size of this fraction increased with increasing antibiotic concentration and reached a maximum in the late-log phase of growth. All 10 strains produced a lytic enzyme that was active on Micrococcus luteus heat-killed cells, whereas only some strains lysed E. faecalis heat-killed cells. Strains producing large amounts of the latter enzyme did not show the paradoxical response to penicillin, whereas mutants of these strains that lacked this enzymatic activity paradoxically responded to the antibiotic activity. In addition, from strains that showed paradoxical response to penicillin and produced only the enzyme that was active on M. luteus, it was possible to isolate mutants that were also capable of lysing E. faecalis cells and that were killed with similar efficiency by all concentrations above the MBC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A single oral dose of penicillin V (36 mg/kg) or amoxicillin (50 mg/kg), two oral doses of penicillin V (36 and 18 mg/kg with a 7-h interval between doses), or six oral doses of amoxicillin (50 mg/kg followed by 8.5 mg/kg at 8-h intervals) protected recipients of the lowest inoculum concentration; protection diminished with increasing inocula.

All regimens evaluated were highly effective in preventing endocarditis when rabbits were challenged with 10(4) CFU. The combination of penicillin and streptomycin was the best regimen tested.

Unencapsulated E. coli strains were readily opsonized in serum and easily ingested by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and antibiotics did not further enhance the phagocytosis rates. In contrast, encapsulated bacteria were poorly opsonized in human serum, and phagocytosis was enhanced after overnight exposure to 0.5x the MICs of the antibiotics, with the exception of cefepime. Incubation of unencapsulated as well as encapsulated bacteria in complement-inactivated serum markedly reduced the bacterial uptake by polymorphonuclear leukocytes regardless of the presence of antibiotics. Slide agglutination assays, performed either with a monoclonal antibody for capsular polysaccharide or with an antiserum raised against the stable unencapsulated mutant E. coli O7:K-, showed reduction but not lack of the capsular polysaccharide of encapsulated E. coli O7:K1, and better exposure of subcapsular epitopes, after incubation with 0.5x the MICs of antibiotics. Flow cytometric analysis of encapsulated E. coli exposed to netilmicin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin revealed that the reduction in capsular material was homogeneous among the bacterial population. Treatment with cefepime and ceftriaxone induced two populations of bacteria that differed in the amount of K antigen present. These results indicate that sub-MICs of netilmicin, ceftriaxone, fleroxacin, and ciprofloxacin influenced complement-mediated opsonization, probably due to changes in the capsular polysaccharide structure.\r"

  ".U": "90225771\r", 
  ".W": "Some enteric bacteria, such as Enterobacter cloacae, can develop high-level resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins by overproducing their chromosomally encoded type I beta-lactamases. This is because these agents are hydrolyzed rapidly at pharmacologically relevant, low (0.1 to 1 microM), concentrations, owing to their high affinity for type I enzymes. In contrast, the more recently developed cephalosporins, with quaternary-nitrogen-containing substituents at the 3 position, show increased efficacy against beta-lactamase-overproducing strains and, indeed, have a much lower affinity for type I enzymes. However, the possible contribution of an improved outer membrane permeability in their increased efficacy has not been studied. We found by proteoliposome swelling assays that cefepime, cefpirome, and E-1040 all penetrated the porin channels of Escherichia coli and E. cloacae much more rapidly than did ceftazidime and at least as rapidly as did cefotaxime. Considering that the influx of anionic compounds such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime will be further retarded in intact cells, owing to the Donnan potential, we expect that the newer compounds will penetrate intact cells 2 to 10 times more rapidly than will cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The kinetic parameters of hydrolysis of these agents by E. cloacae beta-lactamase showed that at 0.1 microM, they were hydrolyzed much more slowly than was cefotaxime and at about the same rate as or a lower rate than was ceftazidime. The combination of these two effects explains nearly quantitatively why these newer agents are more effective against some of the beta-lactamase-overproducing gram-negative bacteria.\r"

This review compares these agents in three areas: efficacy, adverse drug reactions, and drug interactions. Although limited published data exist for famotidine and nizatidine, both are as effective as the better-studied ranitidine and cimetidine when administered appropriately. Subtle differences exist among the four agents in the areas of drug interactions and adverse effects. Individual practitioners may decide if these differences are important enough to affect drug choice.\r"

A highly sensitive serum thyrotropin assay was used initially to screen 968 subjects. Elevated values (greater than 6 mU/L) were found in 7.3%, while suppressed values (less than 0.1 mU/L) were present in 2.5% subjects. Protirelin stimulation testing demonstrated exaggerated responses in 95% of the subjects with elevated thyrotropin levels and subnormal responses in 81% of the subjects with suppressed thyrotropin levels. Thyroid dysfunction, as defined by abnormalities of both serum thyrotropin level and protirelin response, was calculated to be present in 8.9% of the population. The prevalence was greater in whites (vs blacks), in women, and in subjects older than 75 years as compared with the 55- to 64-year age group. Hypothyroidism was calculated to be present in 6.9% subjects. Despite an increased prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in these subjects, only 8.5% of them had subnormal serum thyroxine concentrations. Hyperthyroidism was calculated to be present in 2.0% of the population, two thirds of whom were taking thyroid hormone preparations. These results suggest a significant prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in the elderly, with important sex and racial differences.\r"

The US Department of Veterans Affairs is one of the first agencies to adopt PPS funding for rehabilitation; this early adoption of PPS provides a unique opportunity to test for both beneficial and adverse outcomes. This study compared hospital stay, readmission rate, and incidence of nursing home placement before and after introduction of PPS on a 22-bed rehabilitation service. Hospital stay decreased from 29.3 days to 26.4 days, but 64% more patients were discharged to nursing homes. Findings suggest that PPS may overlook home care in favor of placement, which neutralizes the cost benefits of the proposed reimbursement system. Further research on the effects of PPS is needed to determine (1) impact on clinical aspects of rehabilitation and (2) whether other funding mechanisms are more appropriate.\r"

If responses in 4 of 6 selected measures were required for improvement (by greater than or equal to 20% for morning stiffness, Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate, joint pain/tenderness score, and joint swelling score, and by greater than or equal to 2 grades on a 5-grade scale, or from grade 2 to grade 1 for patient's and physician's overall assessments of current disease severity), few placebo-treated patients qualified as improved, whereas significantly more DMARD-treated patients demonstrated improvement. The proposed index appears to be useful in estimating the probability that an RA patient will improve if taking a placebo during a DMARD trial, and may be a useful tool for analysis of DMARD studies.\r"

To determine potential antibody differences between IgG aPL-positive women with and without fetal death, we studied aPL isotype, subclass, anticoagulant activity, phospholipid specificity, and antibody avidity in selected sera from pregnant SLE patients with high-titer IgG aPL. For controls, we selected sera from pregnant SLE patients who had negative results on tests for IgG aPL (with and without fetal loss). None of the specified antibody characteristics distinguished between the aPL-positive patient groups, nor were other specificities defined in IgG aPL-negative sera from women with fetal death. Although high-titer aPL is a good predictor of fetal death, currently known characteristics, other than a high titer of aPL, do not identify which women will experience this complication.\r"

Staphylococcal culture medium increased the release of gelatinolytic, collagenolytic, and caseinolytic activity into the medium of isolated chondrocytes or cartilage organ culture. The proteolytic activities were determined in assays using radiolabeled substrate and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Staphylococcal culture medium was proteolytically inactive by both assay techniques. RNA synthesis of isolated chondrocytes was unaffected by staphylococcal culture medium, whereas overall protein synthesis was inhibited by 84%. An analysis of extracts of Staphylococcus aureus-infected rabbit knee cartilage by substrate gels showed increased gelatinolytic and caseinolytic activity compared with extracts of uninfected knee cartilage. Our data suggest that the rapid loss of proteoglycan and persistent degradation of cartilage in staphylococcal septic arthritis is due to the production and activation of chondrocyte proteases.\r"

Only 36% of the patients with OI presented the combination of CD4 cells less than 0.200 x 10(9)/l and p24 in serum.

Treatment of CEM cells, prior to or after acute infection with HIV-1, reduced subsequent viral production, but the best inhibitory effect was obtained with treatment before and after infection: an 80% inhibition was achieved with as little as 3 micrograms/ml of PC6. Comparable results were also obtained when PC6 was used to inhibit HIV-1 replication in the U937 human histiocytic lymphoma cell line. Both PC6 and PC7 were relatively nontoxic to cells. The anti-HIV-1 effect of PC6 and PC7 we observed in this report, coupled with earlier reports of their immunopotentiating properties suggest their potential as ideal therapeutic agents for the treatment of AIDS.\r"

Highly purified activated FcR-bearing monocytes-macrophages were infected with HIV-1 in the presence of the sera, then washed and cocultured with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a normal donor. Productive viral infection, as evaluated by p24 antigen semiquantitative assay in the culture supernatants, allow evaluation of protective/enhancing activity of the sera.

Measurements of cardiac output by the carbon dioxide rebreathing method were not significantly different from those obtained with dye dilution (mean difference -0.3 l/min, SD 0.76, 95% confidence interval -0.7 to 0.1). Thermodilution significantly over-estimated cardiac output by a mean of 2.2 l/min or 39% (SD 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 2.8) compared with the carbon dioxide rebreathing method and significantly overestimated cardiac output by 1.9 l/min or 31% (SD 1.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.5) compared with dye dilution. The reproducibility of measurements of cardiac output in individual patients was satisfactory with the dye dilution method but was poor with carbon dioxide rebreathing and thermodilution. Indirect measurement of resting cardiac output by the Gould 9000IV automated carbon dioxide rebreathing method is more accurate but the variability inherent with this method requires that multiple measurements be taken for each determination. Measurement of cardiac output by the thermodilution method by a commercially available cardiac output computer was not satisfactory because not only was there considerable variability between repeat measurements but the method also consistently overestimated cardiac output compared with the dye dilution method.\r"

In 41 patients undergoing direct laryngoscopy, PaCO2 and PtCO2 were measured simultaneously during high frequency jet ventilation under general anaesthesia. PtCO2 and PaCO2 correlated significantly (r = 0.88), but PtCO2 underestimated PaCO2 by 0.84 (SD 0.72) kPa. The arterial to tracheal PCO2 difference was influenced by airway obstruction.\r"

Unlike conventional oscillatory ventilators it is free from restrictions to inspiratory or expiratory gas flows and open to atmosphere at all times, making it intrinsically a safe system for ventilation. A prototype rotating jet oscillatory ventilator designed for application in infants was evaluated in rabbits (mean weight 3.8 kg). The positive peak and mean airway pressures were significantly less during oscillatory ventilation at 300 and 420 b.p.m. compared with normal and high frequency positive pressure ventilation at 30 and 300 b.p.m., respectively, while maintaining blood-gas tensions within the normal range. An increase in the oscillatory frequency from 300 to 420 b.p.m. provided no further benefit in terms of airway pressure, tidal volume or blood-gas tensions.\r"

  ".W": "We have purified factor VIII from a patient with moderately severe hemophilia A (FVIII, 4 U/dL; FVIII:Ag, 110 U/dL) and subjected the protein to Western blot analysis after time course activation with thrombin. The cross reacting material-positive (CRM+) FVIII has the normal distribution of heavy and light chains before thrombin activation, and, after incubation with the enzyme, appropriate cleavages are made at positions 740 and 1689. However, the normal thrombin cleavage at position 372 in the heavy chain of this molecule does not occur. This result is consistent with the demonstration in the patient's leukocyte DNA of a C to T transition in codon 372, leading to the substitution of a cysteine for an arginine residue at the heavy chain internal cleavage site. The severely impaired functional activity of this molecule confirms that the heavy chain of FVIII must be proteolysed in order to effect full cofactor activation in vivo. However, a threefold activation was detected when this protein was incubated with thrombin. No evidence of thrombin-mediated cleavage at position 336 in the heavy chain was detected, in contrast to the variant recombinant B domainless-molecule, FVIII 372-Ile, described by Pittman and Kaufman (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 85:2429, 1988). Using gel permeation studies of the FVIII/von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex before and after thrombin activation, we have demonstrated that the 40 Kd A2 domain of wild type FVIII dissociates from vWF after cleavage by the enzyme. In contrast, incomplete dissociation was detected in the case of FVIII 372-Cys. We conclude that the functional defect in FVIII 372-Cys is a consequence of the resistance to proteolysis of the internal scissile bond in the heavy chain.\r"

Eight patients requiring parenteral nutrition were evaluated, using indirect calorimetry measurements, to determine the nutritional influence on the rates of substrate utilization in the critical period of catabolic illness due to accidental trauma. Five days of total parenteral nutrition, providing calories to match the measured basal resting energy expenditure and N to replace the initial urinary losses a) shifted the RQ from 0.74 +/- 0.03 to 0.81 +/- 0.03, b) improved but could not reverse negative N balance, c) decreased net fat oxidation, d) increased carbohydrate and protein oxidation, e) elevated daily norepinephrine and epinephrine excretion rates, and f) attained positive energy balance. The results suggest that positive energy balance could be achieved in trauma patients by providing total energy intake matching their basal measured energy expenditure plus 7% to 10% for activity energy expenditure. To prevent further loss of lean body mass, an N intake of 350 mg/kg.day was needed in these catabolic ICU patients.\r"

Release of PA activity was maximal at low Ca concentrations ([Ca]) and suppressed at physiological [Ca]. PA secretion at high [Ca], like that of PTH, was increased by treatment of cells with chloroquine and/or 3-methyladenine. Secretion from organoids was not affected by hydrocortisone hemisuccinate, but was strongly increased by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In cell homogenates, PA specific activity was highest in microsomes, from which less than 50% could be solubilized by Triton X-100. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of microsomes and media followed by zymography on fibrin-agarose gels showed that PA from both sources had an apparent mol wt of 44,000. No inhibitors of PA were detected by reverse zymography. PA activity was inhibited by placental urokinase (uPA) inhibitor and amiloride, which indicated that it was a uPA, but the secreted form required tissue-type PA stimulator (fibrin peptides) or denatured microsomes for full activity. Neither the microsomal nor the secreted forms of PA were active with S-2444, a substrate specific for active uPA. By comparison with the characteristics of human activators, the results suggested that parathyroid cells secrete uPA that is primarily in the precursor form single chain urokinase or scuPA.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of progesterone on the estradiol (E2)-induced FSH surge and FSH beta messenger RNA (mRNA) using immature rat models developed previously to demonstrate inhibition or facilitation of the LH surge by progesterone. Twenty-eight day-old rats that received E2 implants at 0900 h had FSH surges about 1700 h on day 29 (32 h). In rats treated with E2 alone, serum FSH was 15.1 +/- 1.6 ng/ml at this time, while in those animals treated concurrently with E2 and progesterone, serum FSH was significantly suppressed (8.3 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, P less than 0.001). For demonstration of progesterone facilitation, rats were primed for 24 h with E2 before progesterone treatment. This led to premature and enhanced FSH secretion: at 1400 h on day 29 serum FSH was 45.5 +/- 2.7 ng/ml compared to 6.4 +/- 0.5 ng/ml in rats treated with E2 alone. To examine the effects of these dual actions of progesterone on FSH synthesis, steady state concentrations of FSH beta mRNA were measured by Northern analysis. FSH beta mRNA generally increased in parallel with FSH release. Levels of this mRNA were about 1.5-fold higher in rats undergoing E2-induced FSH surges than in rats in which the surge was blocked by progesterone. Also, at the onset of the progesterone-facilitated FSH surge, FSH beta mRNA was about 5-fold higher in animals treated with E2 and progesterone than in those treated with E2 only. On the morning after the FSH surge (48 h after E2 treatment) FSH beta mRNA was low to undetectable. In contrast, levels of FSH beta mRNA were 7- to 8-fold higher at this time in rats in which the surge was blocked by progesterone. Serum inhibin concentrations were significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) in animals treated with E2 alone for 32 h (3077 +/- 260 fmol/ml) or 48 h (2344 +/- 148 fmol/ml) compared to those treated with E2 and progesterone in the inhibition paradigm (2469 +/- 106, 1896 +/- 114 fmol/ml, respectively). After 32 h of E2 treatment in the facilitation paradigm, serum inhibin was comparable (P greater than 0.2) in rats treated for 8 h with blank implants (2592 +/- 168 fmol/ml) and those treated for 8 h with progesterone (2720 +/- 188 fmol/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In this study the acute effects of PMSG on protooncogene expression, DNA synthesis, and steroid secretion were examined. The levels of c-fos, c-myc, and beta-actin mRNA were measured in total RNA samples from granulosa cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. PMSG increased the mRNA levels of c-fos, c-myc, and beta-actin within 15 min. Fos and myc proteins were localized within granulosa cells by immunocytochemistry. Less than 10% of granulosa cells stained for c-fos or c-myc proteins in the control samples. In contrast, approximately 40% of the cells stained for these protooncogene proteins 30 min after PMSG injection (P less than 0.05). These values declined to about 10% of the cells 60 min after PMSG injection. DNA synthesis, as estimated by [3H]thymidine incorporation, increased 30 and 60 min after PMSG (P less than 0.05). 17 beta-Estradiol and progesterone synthesis did not change within 60 min of PMSG injection. These data demonstrate that 1) c-fos and c-myc are expressed in ovarian granulosa cells; 2) the expression of the genes encoding c-fos, c-myc, and beta-actin is rapidly increased by gonadotropin; and 3) the increase in the corresponding products of the c-fos and the c-myc genes precedes an increase in DNA synthesis and steroid production. These data suggest that the expression of c-fos and c-myc may be a part of the molecular mechanism through which gonadotropins regulate granulosa cell function.\r"

A decrease in PTH receptor affinity seen in the presence of guanine nucleotides demonstrated that PTH receptors on the UMR-106 cells are coupled to guanyl nucleotide-binding proteins. Although PTH is a potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase in the UMR-106 cells, comparison of PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase and PTH binding curves indicated the presence of receptors that are not linked to the adenylate cyclase system. Our studies also demonstrated that 125I-labeled rPTH-(1-34) bound to UMR-106 cells is rapidly internalized at 22 C, whereas PTH bound at 4 C remains intact and on the cell surface. Internalization of 125I-labeled rPTH-(1-34) was associated with degradation and release of the hormone at 22 C. Three morphologically distinct cell types were identified in subconfluent cultures of UMR-106 cells. Autoradiographic analysis of 125I-labeled rPTH-(1-34) binding demonstrated differential PTH receptor expression in these cell types. The most abundant PTH binding was observed over a cell type with long cytoplasmic extensions. This cell was reminiscent of the predominant PTH target cell previously identified in the rat metaphysis in vivo, suggesting that the UMR-106 cell line may represent neoplastic transformation of the PTH target cell.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been shown to be capable of both the enhancement and suppression of gonadotropin secretion from pituitary cells. In order to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms which might account for these actions, we have examined the effects of NPY on gonadotropin secretion stimulated by either cell depolarization or by GnRH from primary cultures of rat pituitary cells. In one set of experiments, we measured single-cell [Ca2+]i using the Ca2(+)-sensitive intracellular fluorescent indicator Fura-2, in gonadotropes which had been identified using a reverse hemolytic plaque assay employing an antiserum to LH. In another group of investigations, we measured FSH and LH secretion in response to depolarization or stimulation with GnRH, and examined the influence of NPY on these patterns of secretion. NPY was active in inhibiting the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i signal induced by depolarization with 20 mM K+, as well as in substantially blocking the secondary plateau phase of the GnRH-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. However, the peak [Ca2+]i transients occurring in response to either depolarization with 50 mM K+ or the initial phase of the GnRH-induced response, were not sensitive to blockade by NPY. Moreover, treatment of the cells for 24 h with pertussis toxin prevented the NPY-mediated inhibition of the GnRH-stimulated [Ca2+]i plateau. Cell depolarization by 50 mM K+ induced 3-fold increases in FSH and LH release over 2-h incubations. GnRH (100 nM) elicited a 9-fold increase in FSH and a 14-fold stimulation of LH over the same time period. NPY had insignificant effects upon depolarization-induced hormone release, but at 1 microM partially suppressed LH release elicited by 100 nM GnRH over 2 h. We conclude that NPY is capable of inhibiting [Ca2+]i signals in gonadotropes that are stimulated by GnRH, and that these effects are mediated through activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. These effects on [Ca2+]i may underly the inhibitory effects of NPY on gonadotropin secretion.\r"

  ".U": "90228233\r", 
  ".W": "Activins, initially identified as FSH-releasing proteins, have now been shown to exert effects on other cell types of the anterior pituitary, including the somatotrophs. In the present study the inhibitory action of activin-A (beta A beta A) on GH secretion was characterized using primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. Activin-A suppressed basal GH secretion for up to 72 h (the longest time tested). Immediately after the treatment period with activin-A, when the cells were thoroughly washed and further incubated with or without rat GH-releasing factor (rGRF), basal and stimulated GH secretion were partially inhibited as well. In parallel, activin-A pretreatment diminished rGRF-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The effects of activin-A were time- and concentration-dependent, with half-maximal inhibition occurring in the range of 20-30 pM activin-A. A minimum pretreatment time of 3 h was required for maximal effect, and when rGRF and activin-A were added simultaneously, no inhibition was evident. Secretory responses of activin-A-pretreated cells to rGRF were influenced by glucocorticoids. When cells were cultured in the presence of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, pretreatment (72 h) with activin-A attenuated rGRF-stimulated GH secretion only during short (1-h), but not longer (3-h), exposure periods to the neuropeptide. In the absence of dexamethasone, rGRF-stimulated GH secretion was inhibited at all incubation times tested (up to 3 h). A 3-h exposure to the protein factor did not alter total (cellular plus secreted) immunoreactive GH levels, suggesting that the inhibition of secretion with the shorter treatment was not secondary to attenuated GH biosynthesis. However, longer (72-h) treatment with activin-A decreased total GH levels, indicating lower GH biosynthetic rates, as previously shown. Somatostatin is recognized as the primary negative modulator of GH secretion. Activin-A and SRIF inhibited GH secretion additively, suggesting distinct mechanisms of action for each. GH secretion in response to other secretagogues, such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, forskolin, cholera toxin, and 8-bromo-cAMP, was also suppressed after activin-A pretreatment. The presence of the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin-D completely blocked the inhibitory effect of a 3-h activin-A pretreatment on subsequent rGRF-stimulated GH secretion. Pertussis toxin was only partially effective in preventing the inhibition by activin-A. The results of this study indicate that activin-A plays a crucial role as a modulator of somatotropic function, inhibiting GH secretion at the level of the secretory process and secondary to the inhibition of GH biosynthesis.\r"

To demonstrate that one of these cDNAs, bovine PRL-related cDNA-I (bPRCI), is expressed at the protein level, a recombinant form of the bPRCI product was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. An antiserum raised against this recombinant product did not cross-react with the pituitary members of the PRL-GH family or with bovine placental lactogen, although cross-reactivity within the bPRC subfamily cannot be ruled out. The antiserum detected a doublet with apparent mol wt of 34,000 and 35,000 in bovine fetal placenta, but not in other fetal tissues. Treatment with several glycosidases revealed a glycoprotein with asparagine-linked carbohydrates of the biantennary complex or hybrid type. We conclude that the bovine fetal placenta expresses at least one of the novel members of this gene family at the protein level.\r"

  ".U": "90228237\r", 
  ".W": "Previously we had shown that cis-platinum decreases testosterone levels in rat serum and that hCG reverses this effect. The purpose of these studies was to determine the biochemical basis of cis-platinum-mediated effects on testicular testosterone production. In the testis of rats treated with cis-platinum (7 mg/kg, iv), the mitochondrial P-450scc concentration and side-chain cleavage activity were depressed by 40%. Also, the microsomal 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity and cytochrome P-450 concentration were decreased. Testicular binding capacity (in vitro) for [125I]hCG was decreased by 75-80%. On the other hand, FSH binding to Sertoli cell membrane receptors was not appreciably changed. hCG (25 IU/100 g daily) in treated rats caused complete occupancy of the remaining 20-25% LH receptors and caused a 20- to 30-fold increase in serum and testicular testosterone, a 2-fold increase in mitochondrial P-450scc, and a 5-fold acceleration of side-chain cleavage activity. 17 alpha-Hydroxylase activity and microsomal cytochrome P-450 were not increased over the control values. In addition to testicular functions, pituitary glycoprotein hormone production was assessed. Treatment of rats with cis-platinum (7 mg/kg, iv) did not change serum LH or FSH, but caused a 50% decrease in serum and testicular testosterone levels. A GnRH challenge test (1.5 micrograms/100 g, in 30 min) of treated rats caused prompt increases of 10- to 15-fold in serum LH and resulted in increases in serum and testicular testosterone. Thus, there was little evidence for cis-platinum effects at the level of hypothalamus or pituitary that could account for the decreased testosterone production. Reversal of the cis-platinum effect on steroidogenesis by hCG or GnRH appears to be due to the induction of suprasaturating levels of LH with full occupancy of remaining Leydig cell LH receptors. This, in turn, would reverse the diminished levels of mitochondrial side-chain cleavage activity and cytochrome P-450scc. These data suggest that cis-platinum causes a depression in serum testosterone, mainly by decreasing the number of LH receptors and inhibiting side-chain cleavage activity.\r"

Normal animals were surgically prepared for the clamp procedure and then gavaged with glyburide, 2 mg/kg/day, or with normal saline for 6-18 days. Basal plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower in glyburide-treated animals compared to controls, but basal plasma insulin concentrations were the same. Rates of glucose disposal, calculated before and during insulin infusions of 2 to 40 mU/kg.min with plasma glucose concentration clamped at 125 mg/dl, were significantly greater in the glyburide-treated rats compared to controls. Insulin dose-response curves demonstrate that glyburide treatment increased both insulin sensitivity and responsiveness. Basal hepatic glucose production, estimated by D-[3-3H]Glucose infusion, was significantly greater with glyburide treatment; however the sensitivity of the liver to suppression by insulin infusions of 2 and 4 mU/kg.min was unchanged. These data suggest that the decreased basal plasma glucose concentration observed in rats chronically treated with glyburide is the result of increased glucose disposal in peripheral tissues and not associated with an increase in plasma insulin concentrations or a decrease in hepatic glucose production.\r"

  ".W": "It is questioned whether alterations of the sympathetic nervous system can explain the specific increment of the adipocyte alpha 2-adrenoceptor observed during white adipose tissue (WAT) enlargement and fat cell size increment. The impact of a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced sympathectomy, validated by determination of the WAT norepinephrine content, was tested on isolated white fat cell alpha 2-adrenoceptor function and binding [( 3H]RX 821002 and [3H]UK 14304 binding). Chemical sympathectomy of standard adult hamsters, neither alters the alpha 2-adrenergic-dependent antilipolysis nor the adipocyte alpha 2-adrenergic binding. A slight hypersensitivity of the beta 1-adrenergic lipolytic response was observed, without modification in beta-adrenergic binding [( 125I]cyanopindolol binding). Compared with controls, caloric restriction (10 days) of adult hamsters induced a large decrease in adipocyte alpha 2-adrenoceptor (P less than 0.001) with a parallel decrement in the mean fat cell size (P less than 0.001) and alpha 2-adrenergic responsiveness while there was no significant variation of the WAT norepinephrine content (on a per pad basis). 6-Hydroxydopamine treatment of the restricted animals (from day 6 to day 9) induced a higher preservation of adipocyte alpha 2-adrenoceptor density (P less than 0.001), no change in alpha 2-adrenergic responsiveness, and higher preservation of mean fat cell size (P less than 0.05) than in the restricted only animals. No significant modification in the beta-adrenergic binding was observed whatever the conditions. It was concluded that the specific increment in the adipocyte alpha 2-adrenoceptor during fat mass enlargement was not directly dependent on sympathetic nervous system alterations. Nevertheless, the sympathetic-dependent mobilization of the fat stores, after induction of caloric restriction, can indirectly modulate the alpha 2-adrenoceptor density in the adipocyte by promoting changes in white fat cell size.\r"

  ".W": "The association of neuropeptide-Y (NPY)-immunoreactive (IR) axon terminals with TRH-synthesizing neurons in the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) has been studied. Immunocytochemical single and double labeling studies were performed at both light and electron microscopic levels using antiserum to NPY and, as a marker of TRH-containing neurons, antisera recognizing the N-terminal flanking peptides of the TRH prohormone, prepro-TRH-(25-50) and prepro-TRH-(53-74). At the light microscopic level, a diffuse group of TRH-IR cell bodies were observed in the anterior parvocellular subdivision of the PVN and became more numerous and densely clustered in the medial and periventricular parvocellular subdivisions. NPY-IR fibers were observed to innervate all subdivisions of the PVN, but were particularly dense in the anterior, medial, and periventricular parvocellular subdivisions of the nucleus, where they appeared to contact TRH-synthesizing perikarya and neuronal processes. At the ultrastructural level, numerous NPY-IR axon terminals containing labeled vesicles were either tightly juxtaposed to TRH-producing neurons or seen to establish both symmetric and asymmetric synaptic contacts with TRH-containing cell bodies and dendrites. Some NPY-IR axon terminals also established synaptic contacts with unlabeled PVN perikarya and processes or were found in close apposition to blood vessels. These data provide a morphological basis to suggest NPY-mediated neuroendocrine regulation over the biosynthesis and/or secretion of TRH in the PVN. Reports of the colocalization of NPY and catecholamines in the same axon terminals raises the possibility of a potential interaction between NPY and catecholamines to influence TRH neurons in the PVN. Morphological evidence for synaptic interactions between NPY-IR axon terminals and non-TRH-containing neurons in the PVN further suggests that this peptide may influence other neuroendocrine systems.\r"

  ".W": "Two antisera (Anti-P7 and Anti-P10) were raised against (-Gln-His-Pro-Gly-) elongated peptides: P7 Gln-His-Pro-Gly-Lys-Arg-Phe) and P10 (Ser-Lys-Arg-Gln-His-Pro-Gly-Lys-Arg-Phe). They recognized TRH extended peptides but not TRH. A RIA against P7 and a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay against P10 were used to identify two major high mol wt forms of 25-35 K and 6-8 K in chromatography fractions of adult and fetal mouse as well as adult rat hypothalami. The existence of the largest form was confirmed by immunoblotting with Anti-P7. During mouse hypothalamus development in vivo and in vitro, the ratio of TRH content vs. P10-associated immunoreactivity increased several times. This suggests that these Pro-TRH peptides are precursors of TRH biosynthesis and indicate an acceleration of TRH processing during development. Double immunostaining with A-TRH and A-P7 of hypothalamic cells taken on the 16th fetal day and cultured for 6, 12, and 18 days in vitro (DIV) revealed three populations of neurons: 1) a very minor population (approximately 2%) of small round cells positive with A-TRH only; 2) a major population of neurons positive with both A-TRH and A-P7. 3) multipolar neurons positive with A-P7 only (up to approximately 45% after 18 DIV). The respective distribution of TRH and P7 along neurites also varied with time in culture. Whatever perikarya staining, TRH was restricted to short neurites and growth cones before synapse formation and, during synapse development, to varicosities and terminal boutons. However even at the latest stage examined some varicosities and terminal boutons were positive with A-P7 only. These results suggest a preferential processing of pro-TRH at a post-Golgi step during axonal transport to growth cones and synaptic boutons.\r"

TH mRNA and TH were quantified by an S1 nuclease protection assay and an immunoblot assay, respectively. Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and dopamine secretion were evaluated using their rates of accumulation in the culture medium. The rate of accumulation of DOPA was 2-3 times that of dopamine. Inhibitors of TH activity caused a dose-dependent reduction in DOPA secretion. During an 11-week culture of dissociated cells, TH mRNA increased from 1.6 to 2.8 attomole/well between the first and fourth week of culture, remained steady to the ninth week, and then declined. TH increased from 12 to 105 fmol/well between the first and seventh week and then declined. DOPA secretion increased until the sixth week and then remained steady to the tenth week. An extract of rat pituitaries stimulated DOPA secretion by the cultures in a dose-dependent manner. This activity, attributed to a cytotropic factor (CTF), was inactivated by heating for 10 min in a boiling water bath, but was unaffected by trypsin digestion. Incubation with CTF for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h resulted in a day by day increase in the secretion of DOPA. After 96 h of culture with CTF, the amount per well of TH mRNA, but not TH, was significantly (P less than 0.01) greater than the control value. Pituitary CTF is probably not PRL, since rat PRL did not appreciably affect DOPA secretion or the amount of TH mRNA or TH in the cells. Withdrawal of CTF from CTF-stimulated cells resulted in a marked reduction in DOPA secretion as well as a decrease in TH mRNA. These results support the hypothesis that the pituitary gland contains a cytotropic factor that stimulates TH expression in fetal brain cells of the hypothalamus-midbrain.\r"

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and zymography demonstrated two major Mr-forms of plasminogen activators that were found to be strongly increased by castration; inclusion of quenching antibodies in the zymography and immunoblotting analysis identified these as urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and its Mr 30,000 degradation product, respectively. A third, less abundant form, which was identified as tissue-type plasminogen activator, was also increased by castration. The induction of the plasminogen activators was prevented by treating the rats with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. The increase in u-PA antigen was quantitated by the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The increases in u-PA activity and antigen were traced back to a corresponding increase in u-PA messenger RNA (mRNA). By immunohistochemical methods, the u-PA was found to be present in scattered single cells at the surface of the epithelium facing the lumen of the glandular ducts. Such cells were present in control as well as in castrated rats, but their number increased after castration. In addition, after castration, u-PA immunoreactivity appeared in cells throughout the epithelium. These results suggest a role for plasminogen activation in castration-induced involution of the rat ventral prostate, and a role in the normal turnover of the rat ventral prostate epithelium.\r"

  ".U": "90228261\r", 
  ".W": "Steady state levels of plasma membrane receptors (measured in radioligand assays) result from processes that contribute to the production of receptors (synthesis, recycling, and unmasking) as well as those that contribute to the loss of receptors (degradation, internalization, and inactivation). Accordingly, we have previously adapted the density shift technique to determine the contribution due to synthesis of GnRH receptors. In the present study we have evaluated the ability of homologous hormone to affect the rate of synthesis of these receptors. Additionally, because of its role in other actions of the releasing hormone, the requirement for extracellular Ca2+ to mediate the effects of GnRH was assessed. Cultures of pituitary cells, prepared from female weanling rats, were used for all studies. After treatment with GnRH, a GnRH antagonist, or the calcium ionophore A23187, with or without EGTA (a calcium chelator), cells were further cultured for up to 24 h in medium containing either dense or normal amino acids. After this treatment, receptors for GnRH were covalently linked to a radiolabeled photoaffinity probe [( 125I]Tyr5-[azido-benzoyl-D-Lys6-GnRH]) then solubilized in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Receptors that had incorporated the dense amino acids (i.e. newly synthesized receptors) were separated from those that had been synthesized before the addition of dense amino acids by velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients (0-20% sucrose, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; centrifuged at 156,000 x g for 24 h). After centrifugation, gradients were fractionated, and the radioactivity in each fraction was quantified. GnRH treatment (10 or 0.1 nM) increased the rate at which dense amino acids were incorporated into GnRH receptors (t 1/2 = 13 +/- 2, 15 +/- 1, and 25 +/- 2 h for 0.1 nM GnRH, 10 nM GnRH, and control values, respectively). GnRH antagonist alone did not change the rate of GnRH receptor synthesis (t 1/2 = 22 +/- 3 h) compared to the control value (t 1/2 = 25 +/- 2 h) and was able to block the effects of GnRH. The effects of GnRH were not antagonized by inclusion of 3 mM EGTA during treatment (t 1/2 = 15 +/- 1 h vs. 13 +/- 2 h for 0.1 nM GnRH in the presence and absence of 3 mM EGTA, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Increased calcium may result from activation of phospholipase-C, since there is an increase in inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol, and a redistribution of protein kinase-C (PKC) from cytosolic to a particulate cell fraction in GnRH-stimulated pituitary cultures. A GTP-binding protein (G-protein) may mediate GnRH actions, since GTP stimulates LH release in permeabilized gonadotropes and decreases receptor affinity for a GnRH analog. In the present study we have used sodium fluoride, an exogenous activator of G-proteins, to investigate the possibility of a G-protein link between GnRH receptor activation, phospholipase-C activity, and LH release. Treatment of primary pituitary cell cultures from immature female rats with sodium fluoride stimulated the release of 20% total cellular LH and increased inositol phosphate accumulation. Sodium fluoride-stimulated LH release was insensitive to cholera toxin and pertussis toxin. Sodium fluoride-stimulated LH release was additive with a maximally effective concentration of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and was not inhibited by depletion of cellular PKC, suggesting that PKC does not mediate sodium fluoride effects. Treatment of cultures with 3 mM EGTA and 10 nM GnRH for 5 and 16 h reduced pituitary responsiveness to subsequent treatment with GnRH, but had no effect on sodium fluoride-stimulated LH release. Although the precise mechanism of sodium fluoride-stimulated LH release remains to be described, our results support a role for a G-protein in regulation of LH release by the releasing hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Because the role of the pituitary in the testicular control of gonadotropin secretion remains controversial, we examined the effects of castration on the release of LH and FSH under basal conditions and in response to GnRH stimulation by dispersed pituitary cells in monolayer culture as well as by cells perifused with pulses of GnRH. These effects were compared to changes in LH beta, FHS beta, and alpha-subunit mRNA levels determined by Northern blot analysis. Pituitary cells were prepared from 7-week-old intact rats and rats orchidectomized 2 weeks previously. Castration increased basal FSH secretion from monolayer cultures, interpulse FSH release from perifused pituitary cells, FSH beta mRNA concentrations and serum FSH levels each approximately 2-fold, whereas pituitary FSH contents were similar in cells from intact and castrated rats. Pituitary LH content rose 3-fold, LH beta mRNA rose 5.6-fold, and basal LH secretion increased 6-fold, but serum LH levels increased 22-fold. Thus, the change in FSH synthesis inferred from the increase in FSH beta mRNA was proportional to the increase in FSH secretion both in vitro and in vivo. Whereas the basal release of LH in vitro was also proportional to the change in LH beta mRNA, secretion of LH in vivo exceeded these changes, underscoring the importance of increased GnRH to the serum LH castration response. Castration resulted in an increase in the sum of FSH content and secretion during 10 days in culture in the absence of GnRH, indicating ongoing FSH synthesis. Total LH declined in cells from intact rats, and this decline was prevented by castration; this effect may be due to a castration-related decrease in intracellular LH degradation or increased LH synthesis in the absence of GnRH. Castration also augmented the GnRH-stimulated release of LH and FSH from monolayer cultures 4.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, and increased the amplitude of GnRH-stimulated LH and FSH pulses 5- and 2-fold in experiments with perifused pituitary cells. The EC50 for GnRH was unaffected by castration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the mechanisms of homologous and heterologous regulation of PTH receptor binding and receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase activity in the osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106. Pretreatment with PTH resulted in a time- and dose-dependent decrease in PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase which was maximal after 2 h and at a concentration of 10(-8) M rat (r)PTH-(1-34). PTH pretreatment over the same dose range also diminished receptor binding of 125I-labeled rPTH-(1-34); however, maximal loss of binding required 14 h and was greater than the loss of maximal adenylate cyclase activity. After 24 h pretreatment with rPTH-(1-34), cell surface receptors were decreased from 21,000 sites per cell to 2,700 sites per cell, and these down-regulated PTH receptors could not be detected in either vesicular or cytosolic subcellular fractions. Recovery from such homologous down-regulation appeared to require new receptor synthesis. Heterologous down-regulation of PTH receptors was demonstrated when UMR-106 cells were preincubated with prostaglandin E2 or (Bu)2cAMP. Heterologous desensitization was shown to be the result of a reversible modification of the PTH receptor which decreased binding affinity and decreased PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase. Postreceptor components were also examined, and PTH but not prostaglandin E2 pretreatment was shown to decrease guanyl nucleotide binding (G) protein-mediated adenylate cyclase stimulation. This decrease in G protein function was associated with a loss of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation and was also detected by immunoblotting. These results indicate that PTH responses in osteoblastic cells are modulated by diverse mechanisms involving modifications both to the receptor and to postreceptor components of adenylate cyclase.\r"

Preovulatory follicles dissected from ovaries of normal cyclic adult rats on the morning of proestrus exhibit steroidogenic and histological signs of atresia after 24 h of culture under the conditions of 5% CO2 and air. Follicles cultured for 24 h in 5% CO2 and 95% O2 appeared histologically and steroidogenically healthy. Under both culture conditions, human recombinant TNF (5 ng/ml) significantly increased the production of pregnenolone, progesterone, 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone, and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone by the follicles. Follicles cultured in 5% CO2 and air exhibited no change in androstenedione or estradiol production compared to control follicles incubated without TNF. In contrast, follicles cultured in 5% CO2 and 95% O2 responded to TNF with increased androstenedione and estradiol production. Separation of the thecal and granulosa compartments indicated that the increased progestin production observed in the whole follicle in response to TNF originated from the theca. TNF significantly inhibited basal and FSH-stimulated progesterone production from the granulosa of preovulatory follicles. Exogenous substrate added to whole follicles cultured in the presence or absence of TNF indicated that TNF enhanced the conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol to pregnenolone. These studies reveal that TNF enhanced steroidogenesis in both healthy and atretic follicles and that this action of TNF is on the theca, where TNF increases the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. The data imply that TNF has differential effects on thecal and granulosa steroidogenesis.\r"

At 60 min, compared to baseline, there was an increase in cardiac output (7.7 +/- 0.5 to 8.5 +/- 0.6 L/min, p less than 0.02) and a tendency for right atrial pressure to decrease (9.3 +/- 0.8 to 7.50 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, NS), with no change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (10.9 +/- 0.9 to 10.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg). Between 3 and 12 hr later, there was a drop in right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output to 5.6 +/- 0.6 (p less than 0.02), 7.2 +/- 0.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.002) and 7.2 +/- 0.6 L/min (NS) respectively, indicative of the development of relative hypovolemia and suggesting that therapeutic plasma expansion is appropriate at this time. Two-dimensional echocardiography before paracentesis (n = 8) showed a reduction in the right to left atrium area ratio as compared with values in patients with minimal ascites (0.54 +/- 0.04 vs 0.82 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.0001). This technique may help in identifying patients with right atrial compression caused by tense ascites.\r"

At the end of the 12-hr period, hemorrhage had been equally controlled in both groups (18 of 23; 78% in group I and 19 of 24; 79% in group II). When attempted, balloon tamponade appeared more efficient in the failures of group I (4 of 4) than did terlipressin plus nitroglycerin in the failures of group II (0 of 3), although this difference was not significant. Major complications were rare (one in each group) and never required cessation of therapy. Thus terlipressin and nitroglycerin were as effective as balloon tamponade in controlling variceal hemorrhage and were associated with few minor complications.\r"

  ".W": "To delineate the role of plasmin inhibitors, especially the two molecular forms of alpha 2-antiplasmin (that is, the plasminogen-binding and the nonplasminogen-binding forms), in the control of systemic effects during thrombolytic therapy, the consumption of plasmin inhibitors and the degree of fibrinogen breakdown were studied in 35 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or streptokinase. At a low degree of plasminogen activation (in six patients treated with rt-PA), plasminogen-binding alpha 2-antiplasmin was consumed first. At a higher degree of plasminogen activation (in 20 patients), plasminogen-binding alpha 2-antiplasmin became exhausted (less than 20%) and other plasmin inhibitors (that is, nonplasminogen-binding alpha 2-antiplasmin and alpha 2-macroglobulin) were consumed. After extensive plasminogen activation (in nine patients treated with streptokinase), plasminogen-binding alpha 2-antiplasmin consumption was complete and nonplasminogen-binding alpha 2-antiplasmin and alpha 2-macroglobulin were consumed to about 30% to 50% of the pretreatment level. No significant C1-inactivator consumption occurred, even at extreme degrees of plasminogen activation. Fibrinogen breakdown as a marker for systemic effects correlated strongly with consumption of plasminogen-binding alpha 2-antiplasmin. Fibrinogen breakdown did occur, but only when the amount of plasminogen-binding alpha 2-antiplasmin was decreased to less than 20% of the pretreatment level. The other plasmin inhibitors could not prevent fibrinogen breakdown. These results were confirmed by in vitro studies. It is concluded that plasminogen-binding alpha 2-antiplasmin is the most important inhibitor of plasmin in the circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether acute myocardial dysfunction was common in the early postoperative period, serial hemodynamic measurements and radionuclide evaluation of ventricular function were performed before and after operation in 24 patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery. All patients had uncomplicated surgery, and no patient sustained an intraoperative infarction. In 96% of patients, significant depression in right and left ventricular ejection fraction was seen postoperatively, reaching a nadir at 262 +/- 116 min after coronary bypass. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 58 +/- 12% preoperatively and 37 +/- 10% at trough. Right ventricular function displayed a similar pattern. These findings were also associated with depressed cardiac and left ventricular stroke work index despite maintenance of adequate ventricular filling pressures and mean arterial pressure. The depression in ventricular function was partially reversible within 8 to 10 h after surgery. Left ventricular ejection fraction had increased to 55 +/- 13% at 426 +/- 77 min after coronary bypass and showed complete recovery within 48 h. Left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volume index increased significantly postoperatively, but recovery in left ventricular ejection fraction was mostly due to decreases in end-systolic volume index (50 +/- 22 ml at trough and 32 +/- 16 ml at recovery). Depressed myocardial function was independent of bypass time, number of grafts placed, preoperative medications or core temperatures postoperatively. Postoperative therapy with pressors or inotropic agents delayed but did not prevent the occurrence of postoperative ventricular dysfunction. Despite improvements in operative techniques and methods of myocardial protection, postoperative left ventricular dysfunction continues to be common in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine if circulating levels of atrial natriuretic factor comparable with those seen in pathophysiologic states alter autonomic control of the circulation, direct recordings of hemodynamic variables and efferent sympathetic nerve activity to muscle (microneurography) were obtained during two separate protocols in a total of 21 normal men (age 25 +/- 1 years). In protocol 1, the responses of 10 men were compared during incremental mechanical unloading of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors with lower body negative pressure versus responses to comparable unloading during infusion of alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor. Lower body negative pressure decreased pulmonary artery diastolic and right atrial pressures, did not alter arterial pressure or heart rate and increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity from 205.2 +/- 36.3 to 438.7 +/- 100.2 units/min (p less than 0.01). Intravenous infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (25 ng/kg per min) increased plasma levels of the hormone from 24 +/- 4 to 322 +/- 34 pg/ml (p less than 0.01, n = 6), produced similar decreases in pulmonary artery diastolic and right atrial pressures, did not alter arterial pressure, increased heart rate and increased sympathetic nerve activity from 233.1 +/- 35.6 to 387.2 +/- 64.9 units/min (p less than 0.05). Thus, during similar hemodynamic perturbations produced by lower body negative pressure or infusion of atrial natriuretic factor at the dose used in this study, these subjects exhibited comparable sympathoexcitatory responses, with a 109 +/- 23% increase in sympathetic activity during lower body negative pressure and a 76 +/- 19% increase during atrial natriuretic factor infusion (p = NS). In protocol 2, the responses of 11 additional men were examined during lower body negative pressure performed before and again during infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (12.5 ng/kg per min). During baseline (prehormone) trials, lower body negative pressure (-14.5 +/- 1.6 mm Hg) decreased central venous pressure, did not change arterial pressure or heart rate and increased sympathetic nerve activity from 215 +/- 47.7 to 372.3 +/- 64.3 units/min (p less than 0.001). Infusion of atrial natriuretic factor increased plasma levels of the hormone from 39 +/- 8 to 313 +/- 18 pg/ml (p less than 0.01, n = 7); central venous pressure was held constant during hormone infusion by intravenous infusion of saline solution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of substance P, a putative central and peripheral neurotransmitter, on coronary vasculature and its mechanisms were studied in 31 anesthetized open chest dogs. Without coronary stenosis, intracoronary infusion of substance P (0.001 to 1 pmol/kg per min) for 40 s increased coronary blood flow up to 173 +/- 10.7% in dose-dependent fashion. Application of coronary stenosis created by an inflated intraluminal microballoon that preserved active vasomotion of the stenosed segment produced a pressure gradient of 34 +/- 2 mm Hg, a decrease in rest coronary blood flow of 21 +/- 1.6% and significant depression of the rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dP/dt). During coronary stenosis, substance P increased coronary blood flow up to 150 +/- 9.4%, lowered mean distal coronary pressure and decreased stenosis resistance in dose-dependent fashion. After endothelial denudation of the proximal part of the coronary artery, the substance P-induced increments in coronary blood flow during coronary stenosis were abolished. In vitro measurements of isometric tension from both intact and denuded portions of coronary arteries confirmed a marked inhibition of substance P-induced relaxation in the denuded segments. These results show the obligatory role of the endothelium in substance P-induced coronary artery dilation. Furthermore, intracoronary infusion of substance P (1 pmol/kg per min) from the site distal to coronary stenosis that precluded the responsiveness of the large coronary artery decreased coronary blood flow by 24 +/- 4%, lowered mean distal coronary pressure by 15 +/- 1.9 mm Hg and intensified stenosis resistance by 77 +/- 7.2%. Thus, substance P exerts a direct potent dilating effect on both large and small coronary arteries. However, because of its strict endothelium-dependency, this peptide may play a detrimental role in the regulation of coronary blood flow when an atherosclerotic stenotic lesion with endothelial damage or dysfunction is present in the proximal part of the coronary artery.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the alpha-atrial natriuretic factor in congenital cardiac malformations, three groups of children, aged 7 months to 16 years, with different hemodynamic situations were studied during routine cardiac catheterization. Twenty-one (group I) had tetralogy of Fallot, 24 (group II) had a left to right shunt with pulmonary hypertension and 12 (control group) had a minor cardiac lesion. Alpha-atrial natriuretic factor levels were determined by a radioimmunoassay on blood samples from the inferior vena cava, right atrium, pulmonary artery, left atrium and aorta. To evaluate the effect of an acute volume load, measurements of hormone and pressures were repeated after right ventriculography. Alpha-atrial natriuretic factor levels varied over a wide range in all groups and in all chambers investigated. Nevertheless, children with pulmonary hypertension had significantly higher levels of the hormone (p less than 0.01) and were well separated from the control group, but less well from those with tetralogy of Fallot. A 50% increase of alpha-atrial natriuretic factor from the inferior vena cava to the right atrium occurred in patients with shunt lesions with pulmonary hypertension and in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (p less than 0.001) and a further 30% increase from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery (p less than 0.05). After right ventriculography, a 100% to 200% increase of alpha-atrial natriuretic factor was observed in the total sample (p less than 0.001). A positive correlation was observed between right atrial mean pressure and right atrial alpha-atrial natriuretic factor (r = 0.63) and between pulmonary artery mean pressure and pulmonary artery alpha-atrial natriuretic factor (r = 0.61).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The focus of this study was to describe the scope of the problem of pain in a long-term care facility. Ninety-seven subjects from a 311-bed multilevel teaching nursing home were interviewed, and charts were reviewed for pain problems and management strategies. Functional status, depression, and cognitive impairment were also evaluated. Results indicate that 71% of residents had at least one pain complaint (range, 1-4). Of subjects with pain, 34% described constant (continuous) pain and 66% described intermittent pain. Of 43 subjects with intermittent pain, 51% described pain on a daily basis. Major sources of pain included low back pain (40%), arthritis of appendicular joints (24%), previous fracture sites (14%), and neuropathies (11%). Moderately strong correlations were found between pain and infrequent attendance at recreational and social activities (r = .50). However, little correlation was observed between pain and the Yesavage Depression Scale, the Folstein Mini-Mental State Scale, or basic ADLs measured by the Katz Scale. Pain-management strategies consisted of analgesic drugs, physical therapy, and heating pads. Only 15% of patients with pain had received medication within the previous 24 hours. The findings suggest that pain is a major problem in long-term care. Strategies for pain management appear to be limited in scope and application in this setting. Important barriers were identified that influence the reporting and management of pain in this setting.\r"

One hundred thirty-three frail elderly women were recruited from seven nursing homes in central Pennsylvania for a three-year clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a behavioral therapy on urinary incontinence. All of the patients had more than one medical diagnosis. Eighty percent had cardiorespiratory conditions; the most prevalent diagnoses were cardiovascular diseases. Eighty percent had one or more neurological diseases, including \"organic brain syndrome\" (47%) and senile dementia (30%); 44% had arthritis/rheumatism. Half of the patients showed severe cognitive impairment; only 12% showed no cognitive impairment. Sixty-three percent were totally dependent; 68% used wheelchairs, 61% were chairbound; 50% had impairments in vision, one-third in hearing, and 14% in speech. Normal bladder capacity, absence of detrusor instability, and satisfactory bladder emptying, as evidenced by low residual urines, was found in 41% of the patients, suggesting that incontinence in this elderly group may not be a primary bladder problem, but rather that mental and physical disabilities may be a more important underlying cause of incontinence in these patients. An important finding in this study is that 34% of the patients had detrusor instability. It is theoretically possible that pharmacologic therapy with anticholinergic agents or imipramine could improve incontinence in this group. Five percent were found to have large residual urine volumes in association with high-capacity bladders suggesting overflow incontinence as the cause of their daily leakage. Pelvic relaxation and stress leakage was far less common in this elderly group of nursing home patients than in young and middle-aged women.\r"

One hundred nine older subjects underwent comprehensive assessment, which included a questionnaire completed by the primary caregiver to assess the sense of burden in providing care. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of service use at 12 months. Among measures of the older person's cognitive and physical abilities, only activities of daily living predicted increased use of services. When the measure of caregiver burden was added, it also entered as an independent predictor, which significantly improved the prediction of service use (chi 2 = 5.9, P less than .02). In a separate analysis, caregiver burden predicted both the use of home services and nursing-home placement. During longitudinal follow-up, the measure of burden decreased over 12 months for the sample, with the greatest reduction in burden occurring for caregivers whose relative was placed in a nursing home. The fact that caregiver burden was the most important factor in determining who would use formal services suggests that burden should be evaluated as part of geriatric assessment.\r"

  ".W": "The proposed function of intermediate filaments is to provide a cell type-specific structural framework that maintains cell shape and organelle distribution and mediates signal transduction through its connections with the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Vimentin is the intermediate filament protein expressed in B lymphocytes. Immunocytochemical analysis of the high salt-stable cytoskeletons from B cells stimulated with anti-Ig revealed an increased accumulation of vimentin in the cytoskeleton compared to nontreated controls. This increased accumulation of vimentin in the cytoskeleton was manifested by the organization of vimentin into extensive filamentous arrays (EFA) as viewed in the fluorescent microscope. In contrast to the effects of anti-Ig, activation of B cells with LPS did not induce the organization of vimentin into EFA. This suggested that signals unique to anti-Ig directed EFA formation. Immunocytochemical results were verified by biochemical analysis showing that vimentin was more abundant in isolated cytoskeletons from anti-Ig activated B cells, than cytoskeletons isolated from LPS-activated B cells. These observations established a relationship between increased content of vimentin in the cytoskeleton and the formation of EFA. By testing a wide variety of activating agents, we were able to correlate increased vimentin expression in the cytoskeleton to activating agents that cross-link membrane Ig. It appeared that treatment of B cells with LPS prohibited the induction of EFA by anti-Ig because cotreatment with both anti-Ig and LPS resulted in decreased vimentin accumulation in the cytoskeleton to a level less than that in resting cells. The significance of these results with regard to B cell biology is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90229710\r", 
  ".W": "We have measured Ca2+ mobilization in a panel of B lineage cell lines after stimulation with anti-Ig to assess whether membrane Ig transduces a functional signal in cells that are representative of immature, mature, or terminally differentiated stages. For these studies, three transfected cell lines which express the same IgM molecule (300-19 microns lambda 36/8, K46-17 microns lambda, and J558L microns lambda 3) as well as two lines expressing an identical IgD molecule (K46 delta m2.6 and J558L delta m8.8) were used. Cross-linking of membrane Ig on IgM+ or IgD+ lymphomas (K46-17 microns lambda or K46 delta m2.6) resulted in a Ca2+ mobilization response that is similar to that seen in mature, resting B cells. Both intracellular release and extracellular influx of Ca2+ were observed. In contrast, ligation of membrane Ig on an IgM+ pre-B cell line (300 - 19 microns lambda 36/8) induced extracellular influx of Ca2+ but no detectable intracellular release. Finally, cross-linking of membrane Ig on IgM+ or IgD+ plasmacytomas (J558L microns 3 or J558L delta m8.8) or an IgD+ B cell hybridoma (B1.8.delta 1) expressing an endogenous Ig gene, did not result in a detectable Ca2+ mobilization response. Importantly, stimulation of cells with the GTP-binding protein activator, aluminum fluoride, resulted in a comparable Ca2+ mobilization response in all cell lines. In view of the fact that aluminum fluoride induced a Ca2+ response in the terminally differentiated B cell lines, J558L microns 3, J558L delta m8.8, and B1.8.delta 1, it is likely that there is an alteration in the signal transduction cascade at some point proximal to GTP binding protein activation. This finding suggests that differentiation of the B cell is accompanied by the loss or alteration of one or more components that couple membrane Ig to subsequent signal transduction elements. Finally, it has previously been demonstrated that the IgM+ cell lines described above, express the recently described membrane Ig-associated protein, B34. Thus, it is apparent based on the fact that the J558L microns 3 cell line does not mobilize Ca2+ after stimulation with anti-Ig, that coexpression of B34 in association with membrane Ig does not constitute a functional receptor complex capable of activating GTP-binding proteins that in turn regulate Ca2+ mobilization.\r"

  ".W": "Helper (CD4+) T lymphocytes recognize protein Ag as peptides associated to MHC class II molecules. The polymorphism of class II alpha- and beta-chains has a major influence on the nature of the peptides presented to CD4+ T lymphocytes. For instance, T cell responses in H-2k and H-2b mice are directed at different epitopes of the hen egg lysozyme (HEL) molecule. The current studies were undertaken with the aim of defining the role of mixed haplotype I-A (alpha k beta b and alpha b beta k) molecules in T cell responses to HEL in (H-2k x H-2b)F1 mice, as well as the nature of the immunogenic peptides of HEL recognized in the context of I-A alpha k beta b and I-A alpha b beta k. A series of HEL-reactive T cell lines and hybridomas derived from MHC class II heterozygous (C57BL/6 x C3H F1) mice were established. Their responsiveness to HEL and synthetic HEL peptides was analyzed with the use of L cells transfected with either I-A alpha k beta b or I-A alpha b beta k as APC. Out of 28 clonal T cell hybridomas tested, 13 (46%) only responded to HEL presented by I-A alpha k beta b, 11 (40%) by I-A alpha b beta k (and to a minor extent I-A alpha k beta k), only 4 (14%) were primarily restricted by I-Ak, and none by I-Ab. All the I-A alpha k beta b-restricted T cell hybridomas responded to the HEL peptide 46-61 and to its shorter fragment 52-61, even at concentrations as low as 0.3 nM. As this determinant has been previously defined as immunodominant for I-Ak but not for I-Ab mice, these results suggest a role for the I-A alpha k chain in the selection and immunodominance of HEL 52-61 in H-2k mice. The fine specificity of I-A alpha k beta b-restricted T cell hybridomas for a series of different HEL peptides around the sequence 52 to 61 suggests that peptide 52-61 binds to I-A alpha k beta b with higher affinity than to I-A alpha k beta k. The peptides recognized in the context of I-A alpha b beta k and I-A alpha k beta k were not identified.\r"

Regardless of the selection haplotype the CD4-/CD8- cells are capable of activation by anticlonotypic mAb indicating that negative selection does not inactivate the \"forbidden\" TCR. Rather, the lack of response to H-2Ld in the negative haplotype is likely to absence of CD8 required to produce a functional response to H-2Ld. The similarity of surface phenotype and functional activity of these CD4-/CD8- cells maturing in different haplotypes suggests they may arise by an alternative lineage which, unlike the dominant TCR alpha/beta pathway, does not require coexpression of CD4/CD8.\r"

We have studied cytokine gene expression in RA by in situ hybridization of SF cells, enzymatically dispersed ST cells, and frozen sections of ST. RA ST cells (n = 7) were studied and a high percentage of cells hybridized to the following anti-sense probes: IL-6 = 19 +/- 3.3%; IL-1 beta = 9.9 +/- 1.7%; TNF-alpha = 5.8 +/- 1.4%; granulocyte-macrophage-CSF = 2.2 +/- 0.8%; transforming growth factor-beta 1 = 1.3 +/- 0.2% (p less than 0.05 for each compared to sense probes). Similar results were found using osteoarthritis ST cells, although the percentage of cells expressing the IL-6 gene (7.1 +/- 2.5%) was significantly less in osteoarthritis compared to RA. RA ST cells did not significantly bind the IFN-gamma probe (0.2 +/- 0.1% positive), although they were capable of expressing the IFN-gamma gene if stimulated with PHA. The OKM1+ population of ST cells (i.e., macrophage lineage cells) was greatly enriched for IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, whereas the OKM1- population (lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and type B synoviocytes) was enriched for IL-6. The vast majority of cells expressing the IL-6 gene were non-T cells. Furthermore, hybridization to RA ST frozen sections localized IL-6 mRNA to the synovial lining layer, which is comprised of type A and type B synoviocytes. In contrast to the high level of cytokine gene expression observed in ST, SF cells did not hybridize significantly to any of the cytokine probes. If stimulated with LPS or PHA, SF cells expressed IL-1 beta or IFN-gamma genes, respectively.\r"

These T cell clones are CD3+CD8+ and are MHC class I-restricted in their target specificity. They are, therefore, CTL. Interestingly, all gag-specific CTL clones, as well as the gag-specific lytic activity of PBL of this monkey, demonstrated specificity for a single 25 amino acid fragment of the SIVmac gag protein. Moreover, they were restricted in their lytic function by a single MHC class I allele.

  ".U": "90229726\r", 
  ".W": "Here we report that IL-3 (also referred to as multi-CSF because of its colony-stimulating activity on a variety of hemopoietic cell lineages) can function as a macrophage-activating factor (MAF). IL-3 was able to regulate the expression of class II MHC Ag and the cellular interaction molecule lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 on the surface of murine peritoneal exudate cells. The kinetics of IL-3-induced Ia expression appeared to be distinct from that induced by either IFN-gamma, IL-4, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. IL-3 was also distinguished from these factors by the finding that it did not induce macrophage tumoricidal activity. In addition to its inherent MAF activities, IL-3 also showed a marked synergy with low doses of LPS (0.05 to 0.5 ng/ml) as well as IFN-gamma in Ia induction. When lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 expression was evaluated, the effects of these stimuli appeared to be only additive. Although LPS has been shown to inhibit IFN-gamma-induced Ia expression, in our experiments this property of LPS is manifest only when present at doses greater than or equal to 50 ng/ml. At lower concentrations, LPS potentiated both IL-3- and IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC Ag expression. Data presented here also suggest that the synergistic interactions between low doses of LPS and IL-3 are not mediated by known LPS-inducible cytokines of macrophage origin, because rIL-1, TNF-alpha, or IL-6 did not enhance the response to IL-3. Because IL-3 can also participate in the regulation of IL-1 expression, it appears that IL-3 can function as a MAF which selectively regulates the accessory cell characteristics required for Ag presentation, as opposed to the cytolytic functions of the macrophage.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that IL-3, a cytokine produced by both Th1 and Th2 type CD4+ T cells, displays macrophage-activating potential. IL-3, like IFN-gamma, readily induced functions related to Ag presentation (e.g., Ia and lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 expression). However, in contrast to the response elicited by IFN-gamma, tumor cytotoxicity was not induced by IL-3. In this paper we have evaluated the capacity of IL-3 to regulate IL-1 expression. Our data demonstrate that although IL-3 alone was unable to induce the production of substantial IL-1 bioactivity in peritoneal exudate cells, it contributed synergistically to the induction of IL-1 bioactivity in the presence of suboptimal doses of LPS. It was of interest that IFN-gamma, which can also interact synergistically with LPS, was unable to complement the partial signals provided by IL-3 for the expression of IL-1 bioactivity, suggesting that IL-3 and IFN-gamma may be providing similar stimulatory signals in this respect. Our studies on the mechanism of synergy between IL-3 and LPS indicated that the effect of LPS did not appear to be mediated by the well-characterized LPS-inducible cytokines of macrophage origin (i.e., IL-1, alpha and beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6). The best characterized function of IL-3 is its multicolony-stimulating activity as a CSF; in this context we also studied granulocyte-macrophage CSF and noted that it behaves similarly to IL-3 in that it can synergistically contribute to IL-1 induction. A similar, but more dramatic induction of IL-1 synthesis in response to IL-3 was demonstrated by the P388.D1 murine macrophage cell line. The kinetics and the molecular mechanism of the response of P388.D1 to IL-3 indicate several unique features of IL-3-induced IL-1 expression: 1) IL-3 itself induced IL-1 mRNA expression, which was unaccompanied by substantial production of bioactivity, either cell-associated or secreted into the culture supernatant; 2) IL-3 synergized with suboptimal doses of LPS to induce not only heightened IL-1 mRNA levels but bioactivity as well; and 3) IL-3, when combined with LPS, altered the kinetics of IL-1 message and bioactive protein production in response to LPS: IL-3 and LPS induced an early release (3 to 7 h poststimulation) of the IL-1 protein as well as a second peak of mRNA and bioactivity (at 12 to 36 h), which was not observed in response to either IL-3 or LPS alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged exposure of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, a cultured analog of rat mast cells, to 0.1 microM dexamethasone resulted in global suppression of various stimulatory events in response to Ag and a global enhancement of the same stimulatory events to the adenosine analog, N-(ethylcarboxamide)adenosine (NECA). We had previously shown that Ag and NECA both activate phospholipase C but by different mechanisms; cells that had been treated with cholera or pertussis toxin, for example, responded to Ag but not to NECA with the release of inositol phosphates, increase in levels of cytosolic Ca2+, and secretion. Because the toxins still inhibited the responses to NECA in dexamethasone-treated cells, the effects of dexamethasone may have been exerted at the level of receptor/G-protein coupling rather than at the level of effector systems. Additional evidence for this was the following: 1) NECA-induced hydrolysis of the inositol phospholipids was still enhanced after permeabilizing (with streptolysin O or Staphylococcus alpha-toxin) and washing the cells; 2) the response to the G-protein stimulant, guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate was also enhanced in permeabilized, dexamethasone-treated cells and 3) binding and kinetic studies suggested that the enhanced responsiveness to NECA was attributable in part to an increase in receptor number. The suppressive action of dexamethasone on Ag-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, however, was readily lost by permeabilizing RBL-2H3 cells. The results indicate, therefore, that treatment with dexamethasone leads to changes in receptor-coupling mechanisms that are either resistant to (i.e., NECA-mediated responses) or reversed by (i.e., Ag-mediated responses) cell permeabilization.\r"

Where detected, CRI(+) RF were present in low concentrations (6B6.6: 1.21 +/- 1.56 micrograms/ml; 17.109: 1.20 +/- 1.15 micrograms/ml) and constituted a small fraction of the total IgM RF in these sera (6B6.6: 0.9 +/- 2.2%; 17.109: 0.8 +/- 0.9%). There was no correlation between either RF CRI and levels of IgM RF (r less than 0.1, p greater than 0.5). Levels of 6B6.6(+) RF did not correlate with 17.109(+) RF (r = -0.11, p = 0.47). In selected sera that contained both RF CRI, it was possible to selectively absorb 6B6.6(+) RF. Taken together, these data indicate the mutual independence of these two RF CRI among polyclonal RF and suggest the presence of distinct regulatory mechanisms governing their expression. Moreover, that these two CRI constitute a small proportion of polyclonal RF, in contrast to their striking predominance among monoclonal RF paraproteins, argues for the importance of other germline VL genes contributing to polyclonal RF production or the presence of extensive somatic mutation among polyclonal RF in RA.\r"

TR310 immunoprecipitates TCR from cell lysates, co-modulates with CD3, and can be used for immunofluorescence staining of T cells. By using this antibody, we found that the average percentage of V beta 7+ peripheral T cells in Mls-1b mice was 3.8%, but only 0.8% in Mls-1a mice. A similar difference was also observed in the mature TCRhi thymocyte subsets, suggesting that V beta 7+ T cells are deleted during intrathymic maturation in Mls-1a mice.

  ".W": "The effect of platelet activating factor (PAF) on the generation of cyclo-oxygenase-derived arachidonic acid metabolites was examined on purified eosinophils harvested from the peritoneal cavity of male guinea pigs. PAF produced a concentration-dependent increase in the amount of immunoreactive thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and PGE1/E2 released from these inflammatory cells at a relative molar ratio of 30:1. The EC50 of PAF was 20 to 40 nM and maximum stimulation (4.5-fold) of both prostanoids occurred at 1 microM PAF. The ability of PAF to generate TXA2 was rapid (t 1/2 = 9 s), transient (40 s), noncytotoxic, and noncompetitively antagonized by the PAF-receptor blocking drug, WEB 2086. On an equimolar (100 nM) basis, PAF was significantly more effective than C5a, fMLP, and PMA at stimulating TXB2 release but markedly less potent than the calcium ionophore, calcimycin. Pretreatment of eosinophils with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor flurbiprofen (8 microM for 5 min) abolished the ability of PAF to promote both TXB2 and PGE1/E2 release. Likewise, dazmegrel (50 microM for 5 min), a selective inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase, abolished PAF-stimulated TXB2 release but markedly augmented the elaboration of PGE1/E2. Inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase with flurbiprofen affected neither the ability of PAF to elevate the intracellular calcium ion concentration (measured by fura-2 fluorescence) nor its appetency to generate superoxide anions at any PAF concentration examined. It is concluded that activation of guinea pig eosinophils by PAF is receptor-mediated and independent of the concomitant generation of cyclo-oxygenase-derived excitatory prostanoids. Inasmuch as TXA2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchial hyperreactivity, then these data implicate the eosinophil as a potential source of this lipid mediator.\r"

  ".W": "In NK cell-mediated cytolysis, the degranulation of the NK cell, and the binding and polymerization of its effector molecule cytolysin/perforin, are Ca2+ dependent. To determine if increases in the target cell free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) are also important for cytotoxicity, we examined the effects of Ca2+ substitutes, promotors of Ca2+ influx; and inhibitors of Ca2+ efflux on the cytolysis mediated by purified cytolysin. Ca2+ promoted cytolysin-mediated cytolysis but could also inactivate cytolysin on preincubation in the absence of target cells. Ba2+ and Sr2+ could not alone promote cytolysin-mediated cytolysis but did enhance Ca2(+)-driven cytolysis. Preincubation with Ba2+ and Sr2+ did not inactivate cytolysin. One interpretation which these results suggested was that neither Ba2+ nor Sr2+ were involved in cytolysin polymerization and pore formation, but could act intracellularly as Ca2+ analogs once pore formation had occurred. The synergistic interaction of cytolysin and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 further supported a role for increased [Ca2+]i in cytolysis. Inhibitors of Na+/Ca2+ exchange, namely low Na+ medium, ouabain, and the amiloride analogs 2',4'-dimethylbenzamil, 5-(N-4-chlorobenzyl)-2',4'dimethylbenzamil, and alpha-phenylbenzamil all markedly enhanced cytolysin-mediated cytolysis. These results support the hypothesis that the Ca2+ dependency of NK cell- and cytolysin-mediated cytolysis is related to increases in target cell [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, they indicate that Na+/Ca2+ exchange is an important counterlytic mechanism.\r"

Exp. Med. 1987; 165:1393-1402). We show that dLPS can inhibit the ability of LPS, but not TNF, to elicit the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), prostacyclin, and PGE2 by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. dLPS also prevented the accumulation of specific PAI-1 mRNA in response to LPS, but not to TNF. Neither the LPS- or TNF-induced expression of PAI-1 nor the dLPS inhibition of the LPS response was mediated by prostanoids. These results indicate that dLPS can specifically block a variety of endothelial cell responses to LPS and provide support for the hypotheses 1) that dLPS and LPS may interact with a common target molecule on or in endothelial cells, and 2) that dLPS, produced by enzymatic deacylation of LPS in vivo, could inhibit endothelial cell stimulation by LPS and thereby limit the host inflammatory response to invasive gram-negative bacteria.\r"

Inasmuch as rIFN-gamma has been shown to modulate monocyte/macrophage PG synthesis, we examined the effect of rIFN-gamma on the activation sequence leading to collagenase production. The addition of rIFN-gamma (10 to 1000 U/ml) to Con A-stimulated monocytes resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of PGE2 and collagenase synthesis. The suppression of collagenase production by rIFN-gamma was related to its ability to reduce PGE2 levels as demonstrated by the restoration of collagenase activity by the addition of PGE2. HPLC analysis of the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites released by monocytes showed that rIFN-gamma caused a reduction in the release of AA and products of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. These data indicated that rIFN-gamma decreased eicosanoid production by inhibiting the release of AA from phospholipids. This conclusion was supported by the reduction in membrane bound phospholipase activity in rIFN-gamma-treated monocytes. Moreover, the inhibition by rIFN-gamma of PGE2 and collagenase was reversed by the addition of phospholipase A2. Our findings demonstrate that rIFN-gamma inhibits phospholipase activity in activated monocytes and as a result blocks PGE2-dependent collagenase synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of Trypanosoma cruzi secretion products on the capacity of helper (Th) and cytotoxic (Tc) cells to express IL-2R, CD3, CD4, and CD8 in response to PHA or anti-CD3 stimulation. To this end, we used a culture system in which blood forms of the parasite were cocultured with human PBMC. Two-color flow cytometry studies revealed that, under these conditions, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of both Th and Tc cells expressing IL-2R (inhibition range = 30 to 65%). These effects were already demonstrable 18 h after mitogenic activation, and maximal reductions occurred after 48-72 h. T cruzi-induced suppression of IL-2R expression was accompanied by a marked decrease in surface CD3, CD4, and CD8. The surface densities of these markers on the CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells was markedly inhibited by the parasite. This effect was sometimes accompanied by a significant drop in the percentage of positive cells. Diminished expression of all of these surface molecules was observed on activated, but not on resting cells, i.e., no effects occurred in the absence of mitogen. The suppressed expression of CD3, CD4, and CD8 was also seen at 18 h, and occurred concomitantly with a marked decrease in cell proliferation. The inhibited expression of IL-2R, CD3, CD4, and CD8 molecules by Th and Tc might underlie the immunosuppression that occurs during the acute phase of Chagas disease (caused by T. cruzi). Our recent observation that the parasite suppresses responses of human lymphocytes separated by a cell-impermeable membrane, raises hopes that parasite product(s) may be useful reagents for studying the regulation of the expression of IL-2R, CD3, CD4, and CD8, which are known to play key roles during lymphocyte activation.\r"

Combined treatment of ANA-1 with IFN-gamma plus LPS resulted in a decrease in c-fms mRNA greater than that induced by LPS alone. Nuclear runoff experiments demonstrated that the down-regulation of c-fms mRNA by LPS or LPS plus IFN-gamma was controlled at a transcriptional level. Moreover, experiments in which c-fms mRNA expression was evaluated after the block of RNA or of protein synthesis did not reveal any difference in c-fms mRNA stability in LPS-treated and in untreated cells. These results demonstrate that LPS does not affect the stability of c-fms mRNA, but it decreases the transcription of the gene.\r"

However, immature CD4+8+ thymocytes do not secrete IL-2 or proliferate in response to stimulation. We have analyzed murine thymocyte populations enriched for CD4+ and CD4+8+ cells as well as the functionally mature CD4+ lymphoma C6VL-B and the CD4+8+ lymphoma 1010 for their ability to express mRNA related to early products of T cell activation signals. When stimulated with the calcium ionophore (Ionomycin) plus PMA, all the cells, regardless of their phenotype, accumulated abundant levels of c-myc mRNA. However, in contrast to the CD4+ thymocytes and C6VL-B, which accumulated abundant levels of IL-2 transcripts, neither the normal CD4+8+ thymocytes nor 1010 expressed IL-2 mRNA before or after stimulation. We have also examined these cells for the presence of the murine equivalents of two nuclear DNA-binding factors, NFAT-1 and NFIL2-A, which have been shown to be involved in IL-2 gene expression in human T cells. Our results indicate: 1) NFIL-2A binding activity is constitutively expressed in both CD4+ and CD4+8+ thymocytes and lymphomas and 2) NFAT-1 binding activity is readily detected in CD4+ thymocytes and C6VL-B, but is detected in very minimal amounts in populations enriched for CD4+8+ thymocytes and in 1010 upon activation. These results suggest that the failure of CD4+8+ thymocytes to express IL-2 mRNA upon stimulation may be in part due to the lack of inducibility of NFAT-1 binding activity, and that functional maturation of this population might be associated with acquisition of the ability to induce NFAT-1 activity.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past decade, immunotoxins (IT) composed of mAb covalently coupled to toxins or their subunits have been developed for the treatment of malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Despite specific binding to target cells, not every mAb makes a therapeutically potent ricin A chain-containing IT (IT-A). A number of variables influence the potency of a mAb as an IT-A, including the affinity of the mAb, the nature and density of the cell surface Ag, and the type of target cell used. The present report investigates the influence of the epitope specificity of a mAb on the effectiveness of that mAb as an IT-A. Seven mAb directed against different regions of the mouse delta H chain of surface IgD, were conjugated to deglycosylated ricin A chain, and tested for their ability to kill murine B cells. The panel of IT-A had similar A chain activities and similar binding avidities. However, the mAb directed against epitopes in the Fc portion of surface IgD made more effective IT-A than those directed against epitopes in the Fd region. Overall, the anti-Fc-A were approximately 60- to 150-fold more toxic than the anti-Fd-A. Taken together with previous studies, these findings suggest that the epitope on a target Ag recognized by a given mAb is an important variable in determining the potency of a mAb as an IT-A.\r"

The addition of IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma enhanced the monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity of the human melanoma cell line, A375, as well as the human colon carcinoma cell line, HT-29. However, IFN-alpha generally induced more monocyte-mediated lysis of the A375 cells, whereas IFN-gamma induced more monocyte-mediated lysis of the HT-29 cells. These differences are, in part, due to the direct effects of the IFN on the tumor cells. Pretreatment of A375 cells with either IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma significantly enhanced their susceptibility to lysis by untreated monocytes. However, only IFN-gamma pretreatment of HT-29 cells enhanced the lysis of these cells by untreated monocytes. Differences were also observed in the activation of monocytes by IFN-alpha vs IFN-gamma with respect to their ability to induce soluble cytotoxic factors. We found that the addition of IFN-gamma and tumor cells (either the A375 or HT-29 cells) to monocytes induced TNF release, whereas IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma alone or IFN-alpha and tumor cells had no effect. Despite its presence, TNF did not appear to play a major role in the killing of either tumor cell line. However, inhibitors of H2O2-myeloperoxidase system suppressed both IFN-alpha- and IFN-gamma-induced cytotoxicity of the HT-29 cells. Thus IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma can induce both similar and distinct mechanisms of cytotoxicity in monocytes. In addition, both IFN types can increase the susceptibility of tumor cells to lysis by untreated monocytes, although sensitivity to IFN-alpha vs IFN-gamma may vary with different tumor cell lines. These differences observed between IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma on monocytes and tumor cells could have important implications for the clinical use of these cytokines.\r"

Adherence to intact intestinal mucosa in situ was demonstrable with both Fim+ and Fim- bacteria, but Fim+ strains were preferred because they showed approximately twofold higher numbers of adhered bacteria compared to Fim- strains. Additionally, bacterial adherence to intact mucosa in situ was consistently higher in well-fed controls than in malnourished rats. Ultrastructural studies revealed marked cell destruction and lysis in malnourished rats, whereas no histological change was detected in the mucosa of control animals.

  ".W": "To evaluate the relationship between Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization and the development of lung disease, we studied 895 patients who attended our cystic fibrosis clinic between 1975 and 1988. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa colonization was 82%. Patients who acquired P. aeruginosa in the first year of life had a similar 10-year survival rate (85%) to that in patients who were colonized between the ages of 1 and 7 years (87%), and to that in patients colonized after the age of 7 years (78%). One year before colonization, mean age, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory flow in the mid-expiratory phase were similar to those in a group of patients who remained free of P. aeruginosa. No significant change in pulmonary function variables could be demonstrated 1 year and 2 years after the colonization. The rate and duration of hospitalization did not increase in the years after P. aeruginosa colonization compared with the years before colonization. By the age of 7 years, the mean percentage of predicted FEV1 was lower by 10% in patients who were already colonized by P. aeruginosa compared with those who were not colonized (p less than 0.01). A similar reduction in FEV1 was observed at all ages from 7 to 35 years, but no precipitate rate of decline in FEV1 could be associated with P. aeruginosa colonization. We conclude that although P. aeruginosa colonization is associated with 10% lower lung function, it does not cause an immediate and rapid reduction, as has been previously reported. The clinical course and the pulmonary deterioration in cystic fibrosis after P. aeruginosa colonization is a gradual and variable process.\r"

  ".W": "Infants experience dramatic changes in fluid balance during the first few days of life, which provides an opportunity to observe the interrelationships of changing atrial size, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion, and renal function during a relatively short period. To study these relationships, we examined nine infant boys (mean birth weight 1180 gm and gestational age 30 weeks) at 20 to 28 hours of age and then at four 24-hour intervals. Measurements included plasma ANP concentration, two-dimensional echocardiographic estimations of left and right atrial volumes, Doppler determination of ductus arteriosus patency, creatinine clearance, urine flow rate, urinary sodium excretion, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) excretion. Plasma ANP concentration was found to decrease with age and to correlate with decreasing size of the right atrium, closure of the ductus arteriosus, urinary cGMP excretion, and sodium excretion. We speculate that elevated plasma ANP values in a preterm neonate reflect an expanded volume state. As volume contraction, reflected by decreasing atrial volume and body weight occurs, ANP levels decrease, which may diminish diuresis. These findings are compatible with a significant role for ANP in volume homeostasis of newborn infants.\r"

Despite high levels of inspiratory oxygen, the ethane and pentane output was low within the first 24 hours; thereafter it increased up to 100 and 30 fold, respectively. On days 1 to 3 there was no detectable correlation between lipid peroxidation and fractional inspiratory oxygen. However, on days 4 and 5, lipid peroxidation and fractional inspiratory oxygen showed a significant correlation. Maximal amounts of expired ethane and pentane were significantly higher for patients with a poor outcome (five deaths, six cases of bronchopulmonary dysplasia) than for those with good outcome (eight infants surviving intact) (p less than 0.01). The results imply a role for free oxygen radicals in the pathogenesis of life-threatening complications in the very low birth weight infant.\r"

  ".W": "Because the monobasic potassium phosphate salt (monobasic) improves the solubility of calcium and phosphorus in amino acid plus dextrose solutions, compared with the current mixtures of monobasic plus dibasic salts (dibasic), we tested the bioavailability and clinical effects of monobasic in 16 parenterally fed low birth weight infants at standard (n = 8) and high levels (n = 8) of mineral intakes. A constant infusion of macronutrients and vitamin D was provided in a crossover design of two four-day periods. With standard intakes of calcium (35 mg/kg/day, 0.9 mmol/kg/day) and phosphorus (30 mg/kg/day, 1 mmol/kg/day), there was no difference between monobasic and dibasic regimens on balance data or plasma biochemical monitoring (calcium, phosphorus, pH, carbon dioxide pressure, base excess, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D). With the use of the monobasic regimen, the mineral intakes were doubled without precipitation in the infusate: calcium, 70 mg/kg/day (1.8 mmol/kg/day), and phosphorus, 55 mg/kg/day (1.7 mmol/kg/day). This led to increased apparent retention of both calcium (63 +/- 5 mg/kg/day, 1.58 +/- 0.12 mmol/kg/day) and phosphorus (52 +/- 4 mg/kg/day, 1.67 +/- 0.14 mmol/kg/day) compared with that for standard levels of mineral intake. The improvement of calcium-phosphorus balance was accompanied by more severe calciuria (9 +/- 2 mg/kg/day, 0.2 +/- 0.05 mmol/kg/day) and by metabolic compensation for an increased acid load. In addition to the possibility of exceeding the buffering capacity of the infant, this relative acidosis could also be evidence of improved bone mineralization.\r"

Steady-state plasma concentrations of 50 micrograms/ml were obtained within 30 min after the start of infusions corresponding to a total clearance of 2.4 l/kg/hr. Postinfusion, ddl concentrations declined biphasically from plasma with alpha T1/2 = 3 min and beta T1/2 = 35 min. STeady-state concentrations of ddl in brain tissue and CSF were 2.6 micrograms/g in tissue and 0.81 microgram/ml in CSF, respectively. These values represent 4.7 and 1.5%, respectively, of the simultaneously determined plasma concentration. The estimated brain vascular space contribution to the observed brain uptake was 4.1%, obtained by least squares fitting of a compartmental pharmacokinetic model to the uptake data. Postinfusion, the elimination of ddl from the brain and CSF was significantly slower than from plasma, resulting in increased brain/plasma and CSF/plasma ratios after the infusions. The low steady-state brain/plasma or CSF/plasma ratios suggest rapid disappearance of ddl from the CNS relative to its rate of entry. These data indicate that ddl penetrates poorly into the brain. Thus, prodrugs with enhanced blood-brain barrier transport may improve the delivery of ddl to the brain.\r"

The diastolic pressure recorded in animals treated with the vehicle was 41 +/- 1 mm Hg, and administration of BAY K 8644 increased the diastolic pressure to 53 +/- 3 mm Hg, whereas nifedipine caused a decrease in diastolic pressure to 33 +/- 2 mm Hg. AVP, ET1 and ET3 dose-dependently increased diastolic blood pressure, with AVP being the most potent and producing the greatest total increase in pressure. ET1 was more potent than ET3; however, the maximal increases produced by the endothelins were identical. The actions of ET3 but not AVP were potentiated in the presence of BAY K 8644. Furthermore, nifedipine significantly impaired responses induced by endothelin but not those produced by AVP. It was observed that animals treated with pertussis toxin 3 days before the conduction of the experiments had a significantly lower diastolic blood pressure as compared with saline-treated animals. Treatment with pertussis toxin caused the dose-diastolic pressure response curve to ET to be displaced to the right, whereas the dose-diastolic pressure response to AVP was not affected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

[3H]Inositol-I-PO4 accumulation during a 60-min exposure to an alpha-1 or alpha-2 agonist in the presence of 5 mM LiCl was used as an index of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis. Norepinephrine (1-30 microM) produced a concentration-related increase in [3H]inositol phosphate formation with an EC50 of 2.3 microM. Equieffective contractile concentrations of TL-99 (1 microM) and methoxamine (100 microM) produced similar increases in [3H]inositol-I-PO4 formation (1.41- and 1.70-fold increases over control, respectively). Norepinephrine EC50 values of 0.54, 1.7 and 1.0 microM were obtained for contractile responses in 1.25 mM Ca++, 0 mM Ca++ and 0 mM Ca++ + 0.1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, respectively. Calcium omission (no ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid) produced similar inhibition of alpha-2 and alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated responses, assessed as inhibition of the area under the concentration-effect curve. Calcium omission generally produced a slightly greater inhibition of TL-99- or methoxamine-induced contractile responses than did nifedipine (0.1 or 1 microM), but the combination of calcium-omission and nifedipine practically abolished the contractile responses. However, the combination of a calcium omission and nifedipine did not prevent the accumulation of inositol monophosphate stimulated by TL-99 or methoxamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Chronic opioid treatment of neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 cells induces desensitization of the opioid receptor and this may involve a change in membrane protein phosphorylation. In an attempt to mimic this possible mechanism, we studied effects of phorbol ester activation of protein kinase C on opioid receptor activity. Incubation of NG108-15 hybrid cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) abolished up to 45% of opioid inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in intact cells, while basal accumulation and prostaglandin E1-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation were unaltered. This decrease of opioid inhibition was dose- and time-dependent and the potency order of phorbol esters and apparent K activation (90 nM) for TPA were consistent with phorbol esters acting through the stimulation of protein kinase C. TPA also decreased the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation mediated through muscarinic and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. These effects of TPA were best explained by a TPA-induced alteration of the inhibitory nucleotide-binding protein (Gi), the common transducer protein of these receptors. Impairment of Gi by TPA treatment was evidenced by a reduction in agonist-stimulated GTP hydrolysis and activation by GTP. Quantification of Gi by pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation revealed that TPA decreased maximal labeling. In summary, phorbol esters appeared to attenuate opioid receptor activity by altering the activity of the transducer protein Gi.\r"

There were 106 ultrasound scans performed. Of the patients 68 had a blinded excretory urogram for comparison, including 20 who underwent additional studies (computerized tomography scans of the abdomen and pelvis, and/or radiologist-performed ultrasound examinations of the kidneys and bladder). All 18 patients who underwent office ultrasound but not excretory urography each underwent computerized tomography scans of the abdomen and pelvis and/or radiologist-performed ultrasound examinations of the kidneys and bladder. Office ultrasound detected 5 of 6 kidney stones, 6 of 6 hydronephrotic kidneys, 5 of 7 renal masses (4 of 6 cysts and 1 of 1 renal tumor), 3 of 3 bladder stones and 3 of 3 bladder diverticula. Subtle changes of chronic renal infection noted on excretory urography in 4 patients were not detected on corresponding ultrasound scans but voiding cystourethrograms revealed no reflux, and comparison to prior studies confirmed that these renal units were stable. Outpatient ultrasonography performed by the urologist proved to be a cost-effective and sensitive screening examination for urological disorders in the spinal cord injury population. The technique is easily learned, well tolerated and indicated when further urological evaluation is required.\r"

Ofloxacin (200 mg b.i.d.) was given to the patients for 12 to 39 days. Two patients also received additional parenteral antibiotic therapy. Subjective and objective improvement occurred in all patients during treatment, and complete resolution was documented in all patients, with one exception.

  ".U": "90231365\r", 
  ".W": "Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a short stature, brachydactyly, subcutaneous ossifications, and reduced expression or function of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs alpha) of adenylate cyclase, which is necessary for the action of parathyroid and other hormones that use cyclic AMP as an intracellular second messenger. We identified a unique Gs alpha protein in erythrocytes from two related patients with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy and reduced Gs alpha bioactivity. The Gs alpha variant was recognized by a carboxyl terminal-specific Gs alpha antiserum but not by polyclonal antiserums specific for the amino terminus of Gs alpha. To investigate the molecular basis for this structurally abnormal Gs alpha protein, we studied the Gs alpha gene by restriction-endonuclease analysis. DNA from the two patients had an abnormal restriction-fragment pattern when digested with Ncol, which was consistent with loss of an Ncol restriction site in exon 1 of one Gs alpha allele. Amplification of a 260-base-pair region that includes exon 1 of the Gs alpha gene and direct sequencing of the amplified DNA revealed an A-to-G transition at position +1 in one Gs alpha allele from each of the two patients. This mutation converts the initiator ATG (methionine) codon to GTG (valine), blocking initiation of translation at the normal site. Translation of the abnormal Gs alpha messenger RNA would result in the synthesis of a truncated Gs alpha molecule lacking the amino terminus. We conclude that in at least some patients with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy, the disease is caused by a single-base substitution in the Gs alpha gene and is thus due to an inherited mutation in a human G protein.\r"

CGRP is one of the most potent vasodilators known. It occurs in and is released from perivascular nerves and has been detected in the blood stream, suggesting that it is important in the control of blood flow. The mechanism by which it dilates arteries is not known. Here, we report that arterial dilations in response to CGRP are partially reversed by blockers of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP)), glibenclamide and barium. We also show that CGRP hyperpolarizes arterial smooth muscle and that blockers of K(ATP) channels reverse this hyperpolarization. Finally, we show that CGRP opens single K+ channels in patches on single smooth muscle cells from the same arteries. We propose that activation of K(ATP) channels underlies a substantial part of the relaxation produced by CGRP.\r"

  ".W": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus with a genome of 230 kilobases (Kb) encoding about 200 genes. Although infection is generally innocuous, HCMV causes serious congenital and neonatal disease, and is a dangerous opportunistic pathogen in immune-deficient individuals. We have identified a family of three HCMV genes which encode polypeptides containing seven putative membrane-spanning domains, and a series of well-defined motifs characteristic of the rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors (GCRs). By these criteria all three of the HCMV sequences are homologous to cellular GCRs. Members of this receptor family function in visual signal transduction, regulation of homeostasis, and development, and include known and potential oncogenes. These receptors are activated by photons or small molecules such as neurotransmitters, and glycoprotein hormones. The finding of viral-encoded GCR homologues implies a further level of complexity in the interactions between HCMV and its host, and may provide a potential pathway for virally transformed cell proliferation. Their identification could permit the development of a novel class of antiviral drugs analogous to beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists.\r"

One of the best characterized fusions in Escherichia coli is phi(lamB-lacZ)42-1(Hyb), which produces a hybrid protein with the signal sequence and 181 N-terminal amino acids of the exported protein LamB, attached to LacZ. In common with other LacZ hybrids, the LamB-LacZ(42-1) protein is poorly exported from E. coli, conferring a Lac+ phenotype. beta-Galactosidase activity decreases markedly when cells producing the LamB-LacZ protein are grown at 42 degrees C or when a heat-shock response is induced at lower temperatures by overproducing heat-shock factor RpoH3, indicating the LacZ hybrids are being efficiently targeted to the cell envelope. We now report that the heat-shock proteins DnaK and GroEL can, in sufficient amounts, decrease beta-galactosidase activity and facilitate the export of lacZ-hybrid proteins.\r"

Three clusters of alpha 3 residues contribute to the binding, with an exposed, negatively charged loop (residues 223-229) playing a dominant role. CD8 binding correlates with cytotoxic T-cell recognition and sensitivity to inhibition by anti-CD8 antibodies. Impaired alloreactive T-cell recognition of an HLA-A2.1 mutant with reduced affinity for CD8 is not restored by functional CD8 binding sites on an antigenically irrelevant class I molecule. Therefore, complexes of CD8 and the T-cell receptor bound to the same class I major histocompatibility complex molecule seem to be necessary for T-cell activation.\r"

Few microorganisms have sufficiently distinctive morphology to be recognized by microscopy. Culture-dependent methods are biased, as a microorganism can be cultivated only after its physiological niche is perceived and duplicated experimentally. It is therefore widely believed that fewer than 20% of the extant microorganisms have been discovered, and that culture methods are inadequate for studying microbial community composition. In view of the physiological and phylogenetic diversity among microorganisms, speculation that 80% or more of microbes remain undiscovered raises the question of how well we know the Earth's biota and its biochemical potential. We have performed a culture-independent analysis of the composition of a well-studied hot spring microbial community, using a common but distinctive cellular component, 16S ribosomal RNA. Our results confirm speculations about the diversity of uncultured microorganisms it contains.\r"

There is considerable evidence for the involvement of adenylate cyclase in vertebrate olfactory transduction, and some data indicate that phospholipase C may have a central role in insect olfaction. However, one must show that odorants not only stimulate enzyme activity but also induce changes in concentrations of relevant second messengers. One important criterion for a candidate second messenger of chemo-electrical transduction is that its formation must precede the onset of the odorant-induced membrane permeability changes which proceed on a subsecond time-scale. Here we report an odorant-induced, transient accumulation of cyclic AMP in isolated olfactory cilia from rats, and the generation of inositol trisphosphate in antennal preparations from insects, both of which show subsecond time courses that are sufficiently rapid to mediate the odorant-regulated permeability of olfactory receptor cells.\r"

  ".W": "At least two membrane receptors have been defined through which human T lymphocytes can be induced to proliferate and differentiate, namely the CD3-Ti antigen receptor complex and the CD2 molecule. Monoclonal antibodies directed at either CD2 or CD3 induce intracellular second messenger production and subsequent protein phosphorylation. On most human non-B lymphocytes, CD3-Ti and CD2 are coexpressed and seem to be functionally interrelated. But there are minor subpopulations in which these receptor systems can transduce signals despite a mutually exclusive expression, indicating that CD3-Ti and CD2 can act independently of each other. This view is supported by the finding that most monoclonal antibodies directed at the CD45 molecules are strongly co-mitogenic with CD2 but not CD3 monoclonal antibodies. As the intracytoplasmic domains of CD45 have tyrosine phosphatase activity these functional effects could be explained by a physical association between CD2 and CD45. Using chemical crosslinking techniques, we now show that CD45 is linked to CD2 on the surface of human T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90231469\r", 
  ".W": "Contrary to the traditional view that microtubules pull chromosomes polewards during the anaphase stage of meiotic and mitotic cell divisions, new evidence suggests that the chromosome movements are driven by a motor located at the kinetochore. The process of chromosome segregation involves proper arrangement of kinetochores for spindle attachment, followed by spindle attachment and chromosome movement. Mechanisms in Drosophila for chromosome segregation in meiosis differ in males and females, implying the action of different gene products in the two sexes. A product encoded at the claret locus in Drosophila is required for normal chromosome segregation in meiosis in females and in early mitotic divisions of the embryo. Here we show that the predicted amino-acid sequence of this product is related to the heavy chain of kinesin. The conserved region corresponds to the kinesin motor domain and includes the ATP-binding site and a region that can bind microtubules. A second region contains a leucine repeat motif which may mediate protein-subunit interactions necessary for attachment of chromosomes to the spindle. The mutant phenotype of chromosome nondisjunction and loss, and its similarity to the kinesin ATP-binding domain, suggest that the product encoded at claret not only stabilizes chromosome attachments to the spindle, but may also be a motor that drives chromosome segregation in female meiosis.\r"

Although several thrombolytic agents, such as urokinase and anticoagulants, are recommended for treatment, major significant risks include cerebral hemorrhage, especially in patients with venous infarction. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has shown a high affinity for fibrin-bound plasminogen, while exhibiting a low affinity for circulating plasminogen. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this drug for use in cerebral sinus thrombo-occlusive disease. Eleven adult male rabbits were chosen as experimental animals. All animals underwent microsurgical dissection of their major dural venous sinuses. Direct compression was used to form a thrombus within the sinus. The presence of significant venous thrombosis was confirmed radiographically by iohexol sinography. Subsequently, tPA was delivered systemically via the marginal ear vein at a dose of 3000 units/h; the result was total lysis of the clot documented by a sinogram 1 hour after the drug was administered. Postmortem pathological examination confirmed total lysis in seven of eight animals. One animal showed partial retained clot fragments. No significant coagulopathic state was observed. In three control animals, saline was infused without clot lysis. We conclude that tPA is a highly effective agent for the lysis of acute induced venous sinus thrombosis in an experimental model.\r"

A human malignant astrocytic glioma cell line (U-251 MG) and a medulloblastoma cell line (D283 Med) were maintained for 3 weeks in an organ culture system using adult human brain cortex, dura mater, or Gelfoam sponge as growth matrices. The cells were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) at different time points, and immunohistochemistry was performed for BrdU, glial fibrillary acidic (GFA) protein (in U-251 MG), and neurofilament (NF) protein (in D283 Med). In the U-251 MG line, the cells grew successfully in each matrix, forming a fibrillated solid area and a peripheral zone of invasion. The labeling index (LI) expressed as the percentage of BrdU-labeled cells and the percentage of GFA protein-positive cells in the two zones of the explants were analyzed. The LIs in all cultures were significantly higher in the peripheral than in the central zones. On the other hand, the percentage of GFA protein-positive cells in each matrix was greater in the central zone than in the periphery. The LI was inversely correlated with the percentage of GFA protein-positive cells over the areas counted in each growth matrix. GFA protein production in cells grown on cortex and on dura mater was significantly higher than that in cells grown on Gelfoam. In the D283 Med line, the cells formed an aggregated zone, with peripheral cells infiltrating the Gelfoam. This line showed poor growth on human cortex. Cells grown on the dura demonstrated an LI similar to that on Gelfoam, and cells often infiltrated the dura.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) during hyperventilation and hypercapnia. Since the cerebral cortex drains almost exclusively to the superior sagittal sinus, these flow measurements represent an index of global CBF. MR flow quantification provides a new means for assessing dynamic changes in CBF, and may prove useful for monitoring the effects of various disease processes and pharmaceutical agents on CBF.\r"

A major concern in both of these disease states is the development of cerebral edema during treatment. The guiding principles of therapy in both disease states are rehydration, electrolyte replacement, insulin therapy, and treatment of any underlying illnesses. If the patient is hypotensive, therapy begins with colloid or normal saline administration to support blood pressure. Fluid and electrolyte deficits should be calculated and replaced during 48 hours. Low-dose insulin therapy is employed for treatment of hyperglycemia. Neurologic function should be carefully monitored and mannitol administered if a change in neurologic function occurs.\r"

An initial 2-month training and supervisory period was followed by a 6- to 7-month period during which the children or their parents infused IVIg in a home setting. Eight children received an average dose of 204 +/- 12 mg/kg every 2 weeks, two children received a dose of 400 mg/kg every month, and an additional two children received 240 to 250 mg/kg every 10 days. Peak and trough levels varied from 946 +/- 20 mg/dL and 627 +/- 16 mg/dL, respectively, in children receiving IVIg every 2 weeks. The peak-trough values for the children receiving IVIg every month were 1105 +/- 94 mg/dL and 457 +/- 78 mg/dL, while those of children receiving IVIg every 10 days were 840 +/- 24 mg/dL and 553 +/- 109 mg/dL. A total of 224 infusions were administered, with only two minor reactions occurring (reaction rate of 0.9%). There was no difference in the frequency of infections and antibiotic use during the study compared with the previous phase. The results demonstrate that home self-infusion of IVIg in children is safe and feasible.\r"

The encoded protein has 401 amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 44,972 daltons, and it shares approximately 42 percent amino acid sequence identity with arrestin (S-antigen), which has been proposed to quench the light-induced cascade of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate hydrolysis in vertebrate photoreceptors. Unlike the 49-kilodalton protein, however, arrestin, which appears to bind to phosphorylated rhodopsin, has not itself been reported to undergo phosphorylation. In vitro, Ca2+ was the only agent found that would stimulate the phosphorylation of the 49-kilodalton protein. The phosphorylation of this arrestin-like protein in vivo may therefore be triggered by a Ca2+ signal that is likely to be regulated by light-activated phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C.\r"

APP is an integral membrane glycoprotein and is secreted as a carboxyl-terminal truncated molecule. APP cleavage, which is a membrane-associated event, occurred at a site located within the beta/A4 region. This suggests that an intact amyloidogenic beta/A4 fragment is not generated during normal APP catabolism. Therefore, an early event in amyloid formation may involve altered APP processing that results in the release and subsequent deposition of intact beta/A4.\r"

The mean (SEM) serum albumin concentration was 40.3 (0.57) g/l (reference range 35-50 g/l) and mean (SEM) serum transferrin 1.77 (0.1) g/l (reference range 2.0-3.0 g/l). Although only three patients were hypoalbuminaemic, transferrin concentrations were depressed in 26 patients. There was a significant fall in the serum concentrations of both prealbumin and transferrin in the first postoperative week. Nutritional insufficiency was particularly severe in the four patients who developed an early bronchopleural fistula. It is concluded that protein-energy malnutrition is common in patients with operable bronchial carcinoma and that routine postoperative feeding does not prevent further depletion of circulating proteins. A larger prospective study is needed to examine the relation between preoperative nutritional state and outcome.\r"

Fifty two patients had chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the remainder having pneumoconiosis, bronchiectasis, fibrosing alveolitis, and congestive cardiac failure. Of the 54 cases where indications for treatment could be compared with the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) guidelines, only 23 (43%) met the full DHSS criteria before the start of treatment. The median length of treatment was 16 months. At follow up 51 patients had an arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) greater than 8.0 kPa when breathing oxygen. They had a significantly higher PaO2 when breathing air than before long term oxygen therapy (6.7 (SD 1.2) kPa before oxygen treatment, 7.6 (1.4) kPa on reassessment). A similar change was seen in the 23 patients assessed as recommended by the DHSS (6.1 (0.8) kPa; 7.2 (1.2]. PaO2 during the breathing of air was less than 7.3 kPa at reassessment in only 21 (33%) patients.

  ".U": "90233132\r", 
  ".W": "The increase in extracellular potassium [K+]o levels during the early phase of myocardial ischemia may result in part from activation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channels. Glyburide, a second-generation hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, is a potent blocker of these channels. We studied the effects of glyburide on [K+]o and on intramyocardial conduction delay during a 10-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery in the dog. K(+)-sensitive electrodes and bipolar plunge electrodes were introduced to record, respectively, [K+]o and local electrograms from close sites in midmyocardial regions in normal, border, and ischemic zones. Recordings were obtained before (control ischemia [CI]) and 20 minutes after intravenous administration of 0.15 mg/kg of glyburide (glyburide plus ischemia [G + I]). During G + I the extent of the increase in [K+]o was less compared to that during CI, and the difference was statistically significant during the first 7 minutes of ischemia in the ischemic zone and during the first 4 minutes of ischemia in the border zone. On the other hand, the degree of local intramyocardial conduction delay was significantly reduced during G + I compared to CI during the entire 10 minutes of ischemia in both the ischemic and border zones. In summary, our results have shown that glyburide significantly reduced the rise of [K+]o and intramyocardial delay during the early phase of acute ischemia and could thus attenuate the electrophysiologic consequences of ischemia that underlie the initial phase of malignant tachyarrhythmias. Although the effects of glyburide may result in part from a direct action of the drug on cardiac adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channels, other metabolic antiischemic effects cannot be ruled out.\r"

To determine if baroreceptor control of peripheral vascular resistance is also impaired, heart rate and hind limb vascular responses to phenylephrine and nitroglycerin administration were compared in control dogs and in dogs with heart failure produced by chronic rapid ventricular pacing. Baroreflex control of the heart rate was depressed in the dogs with heart failure, as evidenced by a reduced slope of the blood pressure-to-heart rate relationship (controls: -2.5 +/- 0.3 beats/mm Hg versus heart failure: -1.5 +/- 0.2 beats/mm Hg [(p less than 0.04)]). Arterial blood pressure in the dogs with heart failure was also reduced (controls: 90 +/- 3 mm Hg versus heart failure: 75 +/- 3 mm Hg [(p less than 0.01)]). Nevertheless, dogs with heart failure exhibited normal slopes of the blood pressure versus hind limb vascular resistance relationship (controls: -2.4 +/- 0.4 units/mm Hg versus heart failure: -2.9 +/- 0.5 units/mm Hg [(p = NS)]), consistent with preserved baroreflex control of the peripheral vasculature. These data suggest that heart failure impairs arterial baroreflex control of heart rate and lowers the baroreflex pressure operating range but does not alter baroreflex control of peripheral resistance.\r"

Nitroglycerin decreased peak early filling velocity (E velocity) in both normal (p less than 0.01) and LVH subjects (p less than 0.05) but did not significantly alter peak late filling velocity (A velocity), early filling velocity time integral (VTI E), or late velocity time integral (VTI A). In normal subjects, nifedipine decreased E velocity (p less than 0.01) but did not significantly change A velocity, VTI E, or VTI A. In LVH subjects nifedipine increased E velocity (p less than 0.05) as well as VTI E (p less than 0.05) and the ratio of VTI E/VTI A (p less than 0.05). Thus nifedipine, unlike nitroglycerin, improves the transmitral Doppler flow profile in patients with concentric LVH.\r"

Coronary arteriography was performed before and at regular predefined intervals up to 90 minutes from the start of rt-PA administration, and at 24 hours. Acute recanalization of the infarct-related coronary artery was demonstrated in 7 of 12 patients (58%; 95% confidence interval 28 to 85%) in the infusion group and 11 of 14 patients (79%; 95% confidence interval 49 to 95%) in the bolus group (difference not significant).

Levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, a stable metabolite of PGI2, increased from baseline values (less than 20 pg/ml) to 605 +/- 41 pg/ml during infusion. Levels of fibrinopeptide A, beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, thromboxane B2 and the platelet aggregates ratio in blood were similar between the 2 groups before, during and after PGI2 infusion. Prostacyclin reduced ex vivo platelet aggregation to adenosine diphosphate and thromboxane B2 generation by approximately 50% during the infusion period with return of aggregation to baseline and platelet thromboxane B2 production to above baseline after the discontinuation of PGI2. Thus, despite favorable effects of PGI2 upon platelet aggregation and systemic hemodynamics, the prostanoid failed to improve the clinical evolution of unstable angina.\r"

  ".W": "Indapamide is an effective antihypertensive agent in humans and in experimental hypertensive animals. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether indapamide affects endothelium-dependent and independent relaxations in canine femoral arteries. Rings (with or without endothelium) were contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha (2 X 10(-6) mol/liter) before the addition, in a cumulative fashion, of relaxing agents. Indapamide (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/liter) had no direct effect on unstimulated or prostaglandin-stimulated preparations; it did not alter relaxations of preparations with endothelium induced by acetylcholine, bradykinin, adenosine diphosphate or the calcium ionophore A23187. Similarly, it did not affect relaxations induced by sodium nitroprusside, prostacyclin or forskolin in preparations with or without endothelium. Indomethacin shifted the concentration-response curve to bradykinin to the right and did not alter that to the other relaxing drugs. The reduced relaxation to bradykinin was reversed in a concentration-dependent manner by indapamide (10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/liter). In the presence of indomethacin, indapamide shifted the concentration response curve to prostacyclin (in rings with endothelium) and to forskolin (in rings with and without endothelium) to the left. Thus, indapamide does not directly affect endothelium-dependent and independent relaxations. However, when prostanoid production is impaired, indapamide facilitates the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s), and to a lesser extent, the direct action on vascular smooth muscle of prostanoids (prostacyclin) released from the endothelium.\r"

Two immunogenic components of the excretory/secretory products are proteolytic enzymes that degrade host hemoglobin in the lumen of the parasite gut. These enzymes, CP1 and CP2, belong to the class of cysteine proteinases. In this study, a preparation containing both proteinases has been used to detect proteinase antibodies in the sera of individuals living in Burundi. Of 133 individuals tested, 92% were excreting schistosome eggs. All patients with documented infections had positive anti-proteinase IgG titers (mean = 1:614), while 82% had positive IgM titers (mean = 1:267). Six weeks following praziquantel treatment, patients were assessed for egg excretion and antibody titer. Anti-proteinase IgG titers were significantly lower (mean = 1:259) than pre-treatment titers. Patients who were infected with S. japonicum or S. haematobium typically showed a cross-reactive IgG response. Patients from non-endemic regions yielded negative titers, and those with non-trematode parasites were negative (79%) or weakly positive. S. mansoni cysteine proteinases may be used for the detection of schistosome infections.\r"

To determine whether differences in patient severity were detectable in air transport programs, helicopter-transported patients were examined by three established physiologic scores: the Trauma Score, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score, and the Rapid Acute Physiology Score. These scores were obtained prospectively on 1,868 consecutive patient transfer requests from six air medical services for periods ranging from two to six months. A patient meeting strict physiologic criteria was considered critically ill. Overall, 42.6% of the patients (range, 34.8% to 53.3%) were considered critically ill. Patients transported from inpatient hospital units and patients with cardiac disease were less likely to be critically ill than those transported emergently from scenes of accident or from emergency departments. There were also significant differences between programs with regard to the percentage of critically ill patients transported. This study suggests that physiologic scoring may be useful in comparing air ambulance programs and that a majority of patients transported by these services may not be critically ill.\r"

Cervical test results from the initial sexual assault examination were compared with cervical tests on 399 randomly selected female emergency department patients who presented for other gynecological conditions or lower abdominal pain. The victims of sexual assault had ten of 210 positive cervical NG cultures (4.76%), and 13 of 213 positive cervical CT smears (6.1%) at the first visit. These prevalence rates were not significantly different (P = .3058). There were none of 28 positive rectal NG cultures (0%) and one of 22 positive rectal CT smears (4.34%) (P = .451). None of the 43 oral NG cultures was positive. Seventy-three victims returned for follow-up examination. No follow-up cervical, rectal, or oral NG cultures were positive. However, one of 53 follow-up cervical smears for CT was positive, but this was not significantly different than for cervical NG (P = .461). Sexually assaulted patients had ten of 210 (4.76%) cervical NG cultures positive, and nonassaulted patients showed 53 of 393 positives (13.4%) (P less than .001).

This prevalence of grade I hypothyroidism is significantly greater than that reported in studies of unselected bipolar patients during long-term treatment with lithium carbonate, although only 63% of this sample of rapid cycling patients was taking lithium carbonate or carbamazepine. The association of rapid cycling with grade I hypothyroidism cannot be accounted for by lithium carbonate use or by the preponderance of women among rapid cycling patients. These findings (1) indicate that hypothyroidism during bipolar illness is a risk factor for the development of rapid cycling, and (2) leads to the hypothesis that a relative central thyroid hormone deficit occurring in bipolar patients predisposes to a rapid cycling course.\r"

The maximum increment in thyrotropin above baseline (delta thyrotropin) was significantly greater at 11 pm than at 8 am both in patients and in controls. However, the difference between 11 pm delta thyrotropin and 8 am delta thyrotropin (delta delta thyrotropin) was significantly lower in patients than in controls. The lower delta delta thyrotropin found in patients could not be explained by differences in age, body weight, sex, or thyroid functioning. In the overall population, delta delta thyrotropin correlated with circadian variables (ie, mesor and amplitude). With the use of a criterion of less than 3 mU/L to define a blunted delta delta thyrotropin, the diagnostic sensitivity was 89% and the specificity was 95%. We suggest that delta delta thyrotropin has the advantage of taking into account chronobiologic influences in the interpretation of the protirelin/thyrotropin challenge, and this may explain the improved diagnostic value derived from this measure in the diagnosis of major depressive episode.\r"

Patients with Vmax above 2.5 nmol/s per milligram of protein or Km above 5.0 mumol/L had a high incidence of postoperative complications even after minor hepatic resection. By contrast, even patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis could tolerate major hepatic resection as long as their Vmax and Km values were within the normal range. These findings indicate that the cytochrome c oxidase activity in liver specimens can serve as a prognostic sign in hepatic resection even in patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis.\r"

Although the etiology of HO is not known, the main goal in its management is to retain the maximum possible functional range of movement in the joint involved. Toward this end, surgical resection of HO with etidronate disodium treatment to mobilize ankylosed joints has been reported, as has forceful joint manipulation in head-injured adults with HO. This paper presents two cases of extensive HO formation around hip and knee joints in patients who developed pseudoarthrosis. Cinradiographic assessment of the joints involved revealed pseudoarthrosis formation at the same axis as the normal anatomical plane of the joint, thus permitting functional range of movement.\r"

  ".W": "A murine monoclonal antibody (MA-12E6A8) was raised against human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), which, in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reacted 15,000-fold better with recombinant two-chain u-PA (rtcu-PA) than with recombinant single-chain u-PA (rscu-PA). The antibody had no effect on the activity of rtcu-PA or on its inhibition by a chloromethylketone, but reduced the inhibition of rtcu-PA by recombinant plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (rPAI-1) at least 10-fold. The dissociation constant of the rtcu-PA/MA-12E6A8 complex was 7 nmol/L. An ELISA was developed using MA-12E6A8 as capture antibody and a horseradish peroxidase conjugated u-PA specific antibody for tagging. It recognized free and active site blocked rtcu-PA but not rtcu-PA in complex with rPAI-1 or with alpha 2-antiplasmin. This ELISA was used to monitor the generation of rtcu-PA during fibrin clot lysis with rscu-PA in human plasma. Addition of 5 micrograms/mL rscu-PA to 3 mL plasma containing a 0.2 mL 125I-fibrin labeled plasma clot caused 50% clot lysis in 62 +/- 13 minutes (mean +/- SD, n = 6), at which time 99 +/- 28 ng/mL rtcu-PA was detected but no fibrinogen breakdown had occurred. Fifty percent fibrinogen breakdown did occur only when rtcu-PA had reached a level of 1,000 +/- 270 ng/mL (at 150 +/- 21 minutes). rscu-PA, 2 micrograms/mL, induced 50% clot lysis in 160 +/- 41 minutes (n = 6); no fibrinogen degradation occurred within 4 hours and rtcu-PA levels did not exceed 80 ng/mL. In the absence of a fibrin clot, 5 micrograms/mL rscu-PA added to human plasma did not result in significant generation of rtcu-PA (less than 50 ng/mL after 4 hours) and no fibrinogen degradation was observed. These results indicate that clot lysis with rscu-PA in a plasma milieu does not require extensive systemic conversion of rscu-PA to rtcu-PA, and that fibrinogen degradation occurs secondarily to systemic conversion of rscu-PA to rtcu-PA.\r"

Using pairs of flanking primers, each pair including one annealing to repeat sequences within the switch region and one of three primers from the c-myc region (first intron, 3', or 5' flanking sequence of the first exon of c-myc), we have been able to amplify DNA fragments containing the corresponding breakpoint regions from chromosome 14 in both cell lines and biopsied tumor samples. The definitive demonstration of sequences from both chromosomes in these fragments permitted the confirmation of the presence of a translocation. Because of the sensitivity of PCR, we were able to localize breakpoints in samples containing as few as 1 neoplastic cell in 10(8) cells. PCR provides a valuable tool for the detection of 8;14 chromosomal translocations, which should prove to be of value in diagnosis and molecular epidemiologic studies, as well as providing a means of detecting minimal disease.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the value and timing of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 586 patients in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study Phase II-A were randomized among three treatment strategies, one using immediate coronary arteriography followed by PTCA if appropriate (immediate invasive strategy group, n = 195), a second that deferred angiography and PTCA for 18-48 hours (delayed invasive strategy group, n = 194), and a third, more conservative, approach in which PTCA was used only if ischemia occurred spontaneously or at the time of predischarge exercise testing (conservative strategy group, n = 197). Predischarge contrast left ventricular ejection fraction, the primary study end point, was similar among the patients in all three treatment groups and averaged 49.3%. The finding of a patent infarct-related artery at the time of predischarge arteriography was equally common among the patients in the three groups (mean, 83.7%); however, the mean residual infarct artery stenosis was greater in the patients in the conservative strategy group (67.2%) as compared with the patients in the immediate invasive (50.6%) and the delayed invasive strategy groups (47.8%) (p less than 0.001). Immediate invasive strategy led to a higher rate of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) after PTCA (7.7%) than did delayed invasive and conservative strategies (2.1% and 2.5%, respectively; p less than 0.01). Furthermore, among patients not undergoing CABG during the first 21 days, blood transfusion of more than 1 unit was used in 13.8% of the patients in the immediate invasive strategy group, 3.1% of the patients in the delayed invasive strategy group, and 2.0% of the patients in the conservative strategy group (p less than 0.001). At 1-year follow-up, the three treatment groups had similar cumulative rates of mortality (8.7%, pooled over all groups), fatal and nonfatal reinfarction (8.5%), combined death and reinfarction (14.5%), and CABG (17.2%), although the cumulative performance rate of PTCA remained higher in the invasive groups (immediate invasive strategy group, 75.8%; delayed invasive strategy group, 64.3%; and conservative strategy group, 23.9%; p less than 0.001). Thus, because conservative strategy achieves equally good short- and long-term outcome with less morbidity and a lower use of PTCA, it seems to be the preferred initial management strategy.\r"

No data exist, however, regarding whether this damage can be detected in the clinical setting or whether it interferes with the detection of true myocardial infarction. Forty-nine patients who received defibrillations by patch electrodes were studied prospectively. We attempted to document the presence of myocardial injury with the following three commonly used modalities for the detection of myocardial infarction: serial electrocardiographic changes, serial creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and CPK-MB release, and technetium 99m pyrophosphate scanning. Fifteen patients received defibrillations by AICD patches at the time of AICD generator replacement. Nine patients received defibrillations at the time of new AICD lead placement. The average total energy delivered was 85 +/- 29 J. None of these patients had detectable myocardial injury. Ten patients had defibrillations by the AICD patches at the time of bypass operation. One patient in this group developed acute myocardial infarction in the inferior wall after posterior descending coronary bypass operation, as detected by electrocardiogram, 99mTc pyrophosphate scanning, and CPK-MB analysis. Fifteen patients were evaluated for spontaneous AICD discharges. Thirteen had a maximum of five consecutive shocks, and cumulative energy delivered was not greater than 330 J. None of these patients had detectable injury. Two patients had CPK-MB release of 15.3% and 7.5%, respectively. One of these patients had a positive 99mTc pyrophosphate scan.

  ".W": "It has previously been demonstrated that predictable changes occur in mitral flow velocities under different loading conditions. The purpose of this study was to relate changes in pulmonary venous and mitral flow velocities during different loading conditions as assessed by transesophageal echocardiography in the operating room. Nineteen patients had measurements of hemodynamics, that is, mitral and pulmonary vein flow velocities during the control situation, a decrease in preload by administration of nitroglycerin, an increase in preload by administration of fluids, and an increase in afterload by infusion of phenylephrine. There was a direct correlation between the changes in the mitral E velocity and the early peak diastolic velocity in the pulmonary vein curves (r = 0.61) as well as a direct correlation between the deceleration time of the mitral and pulmonary venous flow velocities in early diastole (r = 0.84). This indicates that diastolic flow velocity in the pulmonary vein is determined by the same factors that influence the mitral flow velocity curves. A decrease in preload caused a significant reduction in the initial E velocity and prolongation of deceleration time, and an increase in preload caused an increase in E velocity and shortening of deceleration time. An increase in afterload produced a variable effect on the initial E velocity and deceleration time and was dependent on the left ventricular filling pressure. The change in systolic forward flow velocity in the pulmonary vein was directly proportional to the change in cardiac output (r = 0.60). The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure correlated best with the flow velocity reversal in the pulmonary vein at atrial contraction (r = 0.81). Use of pulmonary vein velocities in conjunction with mitral flow velocities can help in understanding left ventricular filling.\r"

  ".W": "The role of body fat distribution, as assessed by the ratio of waist-to-hip circumferences (WHR), in statistically explaining differences in levels of lipoproteins between men and women was studied using data collected in 1985-1986 from employed adults (mean age, 40 years). As compared with the 415 women, the 709 men had higher mean levels of triglycerides (+38 mg/dl) and apolipoprotein B (+11 mg/dl) as well as lower mean levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (-15 mg/dl) and apolipoprotein A-I (-19 mg/dl). Additionally, men were more overweight, consumed more alcohol, and exercised more frequently than women but were less likely to smoke cigarettes. Controlling for these characteristics, however, did not alter the differences in lipoprotein levels between men and women. In contrast, adjustment for WHR (which was greater among men) reduced the sex differences in levels of apolipoprotein B (by 98%), triglycerides (by 94%), HDL cholesterol (by 33%), and apolipoprotein A-I (by 21%). Similar results were obtained using analysis of covariance, stratification, or matching; at comparable levels of WHR, differences in lipid and lipoprotein levels between men and women were greatly reduced. Although these results are based on cross-sectional analyses of employed adults and need to be replicated in other populations, the findings emphasize the relative importance of body fat distribution. Whereas generalized obesity and body fat distribution are associated with lipid levels, fat distribution (or a characteristic influencing fat patterning) can be an important determinant of sex differences in levels of triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoproteins B and A-I.\r"

Because coronary resistance vessels are spared from the development of overt atherosclerosis, endothelium-dependent responses were examined in these vascular segments. Malaysian cynomolgus monkeys (n = 6) were made atherosclerotic by being fed a 0.7% cholesterol diet for 18 months. Control monkeys (n = 6) were fed a standard diet. Coronary microvessels (122-220 microns) were studied in a pressurized (20 mm Hg), no-flow state using a video-imaging apparatus. Relaxations of microvessels, preconstricted with the thromboxane analogue U46619, were determined in response to acetylcholine, bradykinin, the calcium ionophore A23187, adenosine, and sodium nitroprusside. Microvascular relaxations to bradykinin and A23187 were reduced in atherosclerotic monkeys compared with controls, whereas acetylcholine produced additional contraction in atherosclerotic monkeys. Responses of preconstricted microvessels to adenosine and sodium nitroprusside were identical in atherosclerotic and control animals. Indomethacin did not alter responses in control or atherosclerotic animals. Histologic examination revealed neither intimal thickening nor plaque formation in microvessels of this size class despite marked changes in conduit arteries. Electron microscopy showed minor alterations of endothelial cell morphology in microvessels of atherosclerotic animals. In conclusion, long-term hypercholesterolemia markedly impairs endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in the coronary microcirculation where overt atherosclerosis does not develop. These changes in endothelial cell function may significantly alter regulation of myocardial perfusion by neurohumoral stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Extraction and clearance kinetics of [1-11C]acetate were examined in 65 experiments in 30 open-chest dogs. Twenty-nine studies were performed at control, 13 during ischemia, eight after reperfusion, 13 during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, and two during alteration of cardiac workload. [1-11C]Acetate was injected directly into the left anterior descending coronary artery, and myocardial tissue-time activity curves were recorded with a gamma probe. The single-pass extraction fraction averaged 64.2 +/- 9.7% in control, 65.3 +/- 9.1% in ischemia, 70.0 +/- 4.4% in reperfusion, and 46.5 +/- 7.4% in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia groups. 11C clearance was biexponential in all cases. The rate constant k1 for the first rapid clearance phase correlated closely with myocardial oxygen consumption (r = 0.94) in control, ischemia, reperfusion, and dipyridamole-induced hyperemia groups. Monoexponential fitting of only the first linear part of the clearance curve yielded the rate constant kmono, which also correlated with myocardial oxygen consumption (r = 0.96). Arterial lactate concentrations and the amount of free fatty acid oxygen equivalents consumed by the myocardium were shown to have a small but statistically significant impact on the relation between [1-11C]acetate clearance rate constants and myocardial oxygen consumption. The fraction of 14CO2 activity contributing to overall 14C activity leaving the myocardium after simultaneous injection of [1-14C]acetate (n = 24) was relatively high in all cases (97.4 +/- 2.5% in control, 89 +/- 2.6% in ischemia, 94.1 +/- 3.5% in reperfusion, and greater than 99% in dipyridamole groups), indicating that externally measured 11C clearance corresponds to CO2 production and thus to tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In conclusion, the results validate the use of [1-11C]acetate as a tracer of oxidative myocardial metabolism for use with positron emission tomography.\r"

In 29 pigs, intramyocardial pH was continuously measured with a glass electrode advanced into the midmyocardium of the posterior left ventricle through a diaphragmatic window. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was electrically induced by alternating current applied to the epicardium of the left ventricle. After 3 minutes of VF, precordial compression was begun and continued for an interval of 8 minutes. Sodium bicarbonate (a carbon dioxide-generating buffer), Carbicarb (a carbon dioxide-consuming buffer), and hypertonic sodium chloride (control solution) were infused into the right atrium during cardiac resuscitation. Defibrillation was attempted by transthoracic direct-current shock after 11 minutes of VF. Intramyocardial pH progressively decreased from an average value of 7.26 before VF to 6.87 before infusion of buffers. Systemic circulation and great cardiac vein pH significantly increased after administration of the two buffer agents. However, intramyocardial pH continued to decline to an average of 6.62 after 11 minutes of VF, and this decline was not altered by either buffer solution or by the saline control. As in previous studies, resuscitability was closely related to coronary perfusion pressure at the time of direct-current countershock but not to pH. Accordingly, the rationale of reversing acidosis by the administration of these buffer agents is not supported. Even more important, neither carbon dioxide-consuming nor carbon dioxide-producing buffers altered myocardial acidosis or improved myocardial resuscitability under controlled experimental conditions of cardiac arrest.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the vasodilator function of endothelium that regenerated after balloon angioplasty and the relation of this function to the extent of vascular injury and to subsequent intimal proliferation. Balloon angioplasty was performed in the left iliac artery of 47 New Zealand White rabbits. Vascular responses were examined in vitro 2 and 4 weeks after a \"severe\" injury (3.0-mm balloon) or a \"moderate\" injury (2.5-mm balloon). Both degrees of balloon injury caused complete endothelial denudation. Endothelial regrowth 2 weeks after either injury was confirmed histologically. Although the regenerated cells had irregular sizes and polygonal shapes and lacked the typical alignment in the direction of blood flow, immunocytochemical staining for factor VIII-related antigen identified these cells as endothelium. To study the vasodilator function of regenerated endothelium, rings of balloon-injured and control (contralateral) iliac arteries were suspended in organ chambers for recording of isometric force. Endothelium-dependent relaxation of balloon-injured vessels to acetylcholine and to the calcium ionophore A23187 were reduced at 2 and at 4 weeks after severe injury. After moderate injury, endothelium-dependent relaxations to these agents were reduced at 2 weeks but had normalized by 4 weeks. Endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside, however, was preserved in all study groups. Morphometric analysis revealed an inverse correlation between the degree of intimal thickening and maximal relaxation to acetylcholine (r = 0.45, p less than 0.01). Thus, there is a persistent attenuation of receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxations after arterial injury. The regenerated cells have an altered morphological appearance, but staining for factor VIII-related antigen confirms their endothelial origin. The degree and duration of endothelial dysfunction depends on the severity of the initial injury and is related to the extent of intimal thickness.\r"

The development of stimulatory tests to evaluate secretory reserve has been of particular value for the early detection of endocrine tumors and preneoplastic lesions in the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. In addition, analysis of tumor markers has been of considerable importance for estimating total tumor burden and assessing responses to various therapeutic modalities. Recent advances in molecular biologic and cytogenetic technologies have the potential for prenatal detection of some forms of the inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was the prospective evaluation of the relationship between serum and pleural fluid antibody levels to mycobacterial antigens and their role in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleuritis. The setting was a tertiary care medical center. Thirteen patients with tuberculous pleuritis and 53 control subjects with pleural effusion (22 with carcinoma, 17 with cardiac failure, and 14 with empyema or parapneumonic effusion) were studied. The level of IgG was measured by ELISA. The median titers of antibody to both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M avium were significantly higher in the serum and pleural fluid of the patients with tuberculosis than in the control patients. There was a very close relationship between the levels of M tuberculosis (r = 0.95) and M avium (r = 0.94) antibodies in the serum and pleural fluid. We concluded that the levels of antimycobacterial IgG in pleural fluid, adjusted to constant protein concentration, are very closely related to the serum levels. Therefore, these antibodies in the pleural fluid probably result from passive diffusion from serum and not local production. Measurement of pleural fluid antibody levels will not add diagnostic sensitivity or specificity to that achieved with serodiagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "New incentives regarding delivery of inpatient care by physicians and administrators have resulted from Medicare's DRG-based prospective reimbursement system. As these payment systems become widely adopted by other third-party payors, implications for adequate hospital reimbursement and quality inpatient care will intensify. This study of inflammatory bowel disease inpatients examines discharge data for 300 patients comprising 507 admissions from 1983 to 1987 at a large tertiary center hospital. While only 10.8% of these discharges were Medicare patients, all discharges were assigned a diagnosis-related-group reimbursement to derive a theoretical monetary loss or gain for the hospital. Overall hospital losses averaged $127.24 per case for this patient population, in which the medical and pediatric cases were adequately reimbursed, and the surgical admissions represented greater losses. The average length of stay for all patients decreased from 11.9 to 7.4 days over the study period, mostly a result of reductions in surgical hospital stays. We conclude that reimbursement for medical and pediatric discharges under DRG 179 appear adequate for this hospital, while surgical inflammatory bowel disease reimbursement is not. These data will be useful for comparison of future trends of inpatient utilization for inflammatory bowel disease patients as prospective reimbursement practices become more widespread.\r"

The results of the [51CR]EDTA test were compared with the serum levels of the acute-phase reactant proteins (APRP) and with the result of the [111In]leukocyte scanning, respectively, as an indirect and direct method to assess intestinal inflammation. In a group of healthy adult controls, the upper normal value for the 24-hr urinary [51CR]EDTA excretion was 3.61 (97.5% percentile) and the mean coefficient of variation was 21%. Sensitivity and specificity of the [51CR]EDTA test in identifying active inflammation expressed by increased serum levels of APRP were, respectively, 97% and 54% in the unresected group and 68% and 52% in the resected group of patients. The low specificity of the test was due to the presence of increased [51CR]EDTA urinary excretion in about half the cases with normal serum levels of APRP. The [111In]leukocyte scanning was performed in a subgroup of 11 patients (three unresected and eight resected) with normal serum levels of APRP, six with increased and five with normal [51CR]EDTA urinary excretion. All six patients with increased intestinal permeability had a positive 111In image of mild to moderate degree of activity. A positive 111In scan was present in two of the five patients with normal permeability; these were two resected patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results from 68 cycles of daily intramuscular (IM) FSH and 41 cycles of IM hMG were compared. The ovulation rate, maximum serum estradiol (E2) levels achieved, and pregnancy rate were similar in both groups, but FSH resulted in significantly fewer follicles developing and hyperstimulation. The 68 cycles of daily IM FSH were further compared with the outcome of administering the FSH as an alternate-day IM injection in 70 cycles, and by subcutaneous pulsatile injection in 31 cycles. There were no differences in any of the parameters measured between daily and alternate-day FSH. Pulsatile FSH required a greater total dose over a longer period of time to achieve stimulation. It also produced fewer follicles, a lower maximum serum E2 level, and the lowest incidence of hyperstimulation. Twenty pregnancies resulted, of which 6 aborted in the first trimester; there was 1 set of twins and 13 singleton pregnancies. The cumulative pregnancy rate after 6 treatment cycles was 62%.\r"

Despite this, little is known regarding the prognosis of future menotropin-induced pregnancies in women who abort in their first hMG pregnancy. We retrospectively reviewed the obstetrical outcome of women who achieved two or more menotropin pregnancies between the years 1980 and 1987. Nineteen of 40 patients (48%) whose first hMG pregnancy ended in an early spontaneous abortion went on to abort in a second hMG pregnancy, as compared with only 1 of 15 women (6.7%) whose first hMG pregnancy was successful. Age, parity, weight, height, and plasma estradiol levels at hCG administration did not differ between the two groups. From this data we conclude that women whose first hMG pregnancy results in a spontaneous abortion are at high risk for another spontaneous abortion in a subsequent menotropin conception.\r"

Pooled human FF was found to inhibit binding of radioiodinated human FSH (125I-hFSH) to its receptor in a concentration-related manner. Fractionation of human FF by sequential ultrafiltration through membranes of calibrated pore size resulted in human FF components of low (500 to 5,000) and high (greater than 5,000) molecular weight, (Mr) respectively. Each of these inhibited 125I-hFSH binding to receptor in a concentration-related manner. Dansylation of the above components revealed the Rf = 0.15 dansyl derivative to be present in unfractionated human FF and in the low (500 to 5,000 Mr), but not the high (greater than 5,000 Mr), component of human FF. These findings are consistent with those previously reported for bovine FF and porcine FF and indicate that human FF contains FSH receptor-binding inhibitors with properties similar to those observed in animal species.\r"

The window of implantation may represent one of the rate-limiting steps in IVF success. We therefore investigated estimated implantation times of 10 consecutive IVF singleton pregnancies, achieved using pituitary suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) before and during ovarian stimulation with human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), and compared those with 9 consecutive IVF pregnancies achieved by hMG stimulation only. Estimated implantation times were calculated by regression analysis of serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements between days 7 and 16 after ET. The GnRH-a/hMG pregnancies implanted between days 7 and 11, whereas hMG pregnancies implanted between days 7 and 9 after ET. The hCG regression curve for the GnRH-a/hMG pregnancies revealed a delay of 1.5 days in estimated implantation time compared with the hMG only group. There were no significant differences in pretransfer in vitro embryos development between the two groups. Thus, the delay in hCG rise probably reflects a delay in embryo implantation. We therefore conclude that a GnRH-a/hMG stimulation protocol appears to widen the implantation window in comparison with a hMG only protocol. This observation may at least in part explain the improved IVF pregnancy success with GnRH-a/hMG stimulation protocols.\r"

Comparison of the hormonal pattern of both groups showed that a premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge was avoided only in group A, and only in this group a second follicle aspiration for IVF-ET was done, and two pregnancies were achieved. In group B, aspiration for IVF-ET was canceled because of premature LH surge. It is suggested that aspiration of a single leading follicle during ovulation induction may be an efficient method to avoid premature LH surge enabling other follicles to develop up to the preovulatory stage.\r"

To control for embryo quality, IVF patient characteristics were matched to those of the oocyte donors with regard to age and previous gravidity. All cycles were performed in an identical manner, using standardized ovarian stimulation protocols, transvaginal follicle aspiration, fertilization and culture in vitro, and transcervical embryo transfer. A similar number of oocytes per cycle were obtained, fertilization rates were similar, and similar numbers of embryos were transferred in both groups. Transferred embryos had similar numbers of blastomeres and were morphologically judged to be of similar quality in both groups. Implantation rates per individual embryo were significantly higher in donor than in standard IVF (35% versus 10.7%) as were ongoing per embryo implantation rates (23% versus 8%). Clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates per cycle were likewise higher in the donor group than in the standard IVF group (67% versus 39%, and 61% versus 30%, respectively). We conclude that COH inhibits embryo implantation after IVF by decreasing endometrial receptivity, which is an important factor in IVF pregnancy success.\r"

After 6 mo of treatment, the preventive effect on heart-rate variability was partial, and the vagus nerve demonstrated an increase in regenerating myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. These data suggest that autonomic neuropathy involving the vagus nerve is metabolically induced by demonstrating that inhibition of the polyol pathway significantly delays the occurrence of functional and structural autonomic neuropathy despite the presence of hyperglycemia.\r"

DR islet grafts were then transplanted into both groups. DR transplants into STZ-induced diabetic DR rats produced long-term normoglycemia. In contrast, DR transplants into DR rats that had been treated with anti-RT6 monoclonal antibody were all destroyed within an average of 4 days. Allogeneic islets transplanted into both STZ-induced and RT6-depleted diabetic DR rats were rejected within a mean of 3 days.

  ".W": "The possibility that prostacyclin or thromboxane biosynthesis is abnormal in patients with established mild essential hypertension was investigated in 46 patients. These eicosanoids have opposing effects both on vascular smooth muscle and on platelets. An imbalance in their biosynthesis could therefore influence both vascular tone and predisposition to thrombosis. We studied the relation between blood pressure and the biosynthesis of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 by measuring urinary excretion rates of stable breakdown products of prostacyclin (6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha) and of thromboxane A2 (thromboxane B2 and 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2) using immunoaffinity chromatography and gas chromatography/electron capture mass spectrometry. Excretion rates of both of the prostacyclin-derived products ranged from less than 5 to more than 100 ng/g creatinine; each was significantly negatively correlated with blood pressure (r = 0.36-0.45). A reduction of 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha excretion of 100 ng/g creatinine was associated with an increase in arterial pressure of 14 mm Hg (systolic) and 8 mm Hg (diastolic) in patients who had been without antihypertensive medication for 2 weeks. The same reduction in 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha excretion was associated with an increased pressure of 19 mm Hg (systolic) and 12 mm Hg (diastolic) (2p less than 0.05 for diastolic pressure and 2p less than 0.01 for systolic pressure in each case). There were similar correlations between the excretion rates of these products and blood pressure in the same patients while they were receiving antihypertensive therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Two subclasses of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-specific phosphodiesterases were identified in vascular tissue from several beds. The activity of one subclass (phosphodiesterase IB) was stimulated severalfold by calmodulin and selectively inhibited by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor TCV-3B. The activity of the other subclass (phosphodiesterase IC) was not stimulated by calmodulin and was selectively inhibited by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor M&B 22,948. To assess the involvement of both subclasses in regulating cyclic GMP-dependent responses, the ability of TCV-3B and M&B 22,948 to potentiate the in vitro and in vivo responses to the endogenous guanylate cyclase stimulator atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was evaluated. Both TCV-3B and M&B 22,948 relaxed isolated rabbit aortic and pulmonary artery rings and also potentiated the relaxant effect of ANF. In addition, both inhibitors produced small increases in urine flow and sodium excretion in anesthetized rats and potentiated the diuretic and natriuretic responses to exogenous ANF. M&B 22,948 (30 micrograms/kg/min) produced a threefold increase in the natriuretic response to simultaneously administered ANF, and TCV-3B (10 micrograms/kg/min) produced a twofold increase in the response to ANF. The results of the present experiments suggest that both the calmodulin-sensitive and calmodulin-insensitive subclasses of cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterase play a role in regulating the in vitro and in vivo response to ANF.\r"

Compared with normal subjects (n = 19), the group with sarcoidosis had increased numbers of CD3+ alpha beta-negative (-) T cells in the blood (normal, 58 +/- 12 cells/microliters; sarcoid, 192 +/- 45 cells/microliters, P less than 0.05) and in the epithelial lining fluid of the lung (normal, 78 14 cells/microliters; sarcoid, 240 +/- 60 cells/microliters, P less than 0.04) and a concomitant elevated number of blood and lung CD3+ gamma delta+ T cells, owing to a striking increase in the number of CD3+ gamma delta+ T cells in a subgroup (7 of 20) of sarcoid individuals. The elevated numbers of sarcoid blood gamma delta+ T lymphocytes were mostly Ti gamma A+ and delta TCS1-, a pattern also seen in normal individuals, consistent with the majority of gamma delta+ T cells expressing one gamma-chain variable region, V gamma 9. The observation of an increase in the total gamma delta+ T cell numbers in a sarcoid subgroup suggests that various specific stimuli may trigger the expansion of different T cell subpopulations within different groups of individuals with sarcoidosis.\r"

The antibody is produced by an EBV-transformed B cell line derived from a patient with multiple myeloma whose myeloma protein is also an IgG, 3I-reactive, F4-reactive, DNA-binding immunoglobulin, although the 2A4 antibody does not itself represent the myeloma protein. The 2A4 heavy chain is encoded by a VH4 gene, a D-D gene fusion and the JH6 gene; the light chain is derived from a Vk1 gene and the Jk2 gene. This is the first human antibody shown to have a CDR3 encoded by a D-D fusion. DNA sequence analysis of the 2A4 VH gene together with a Southern blot of genomic DNA probed with a 2A4 VH-specific oligonucleotide strongly suggest it to be somatically mutated. The data provide evidence that human autoantibodies can be products of somatically mutated genes and suggest that the 2A4 antibody may reflect the selective pressure of antigen.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that aldose reductase inhibition may prevent or delay the development of functional and structural neuropathy in the insulin-deficient diabetic Bio-Breeding rat (BB-rat), hyperglycemic rats were begun on the aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) ponalrestat 25 mg/kg body wt soon after the onset of diabetes and followed for 4 or 6 mo. Ponalrestat treatment completely prevented the characteristic nerve conduction slowing and structural abnormalities of the node of Ranvier for 4 mo despite only partial preservation of axonal integrity. Ponalrestat treatment for 6 mo achieved a partial but significant prevention of nerve conduction slowing, axoglial dysjunction, and axonal degenerative changes. This incomplete but significant prevention of neuropathy by ponalrestat suggests that additional mechanisms besides polyol-pathway activation may be of importance in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. Alternatively, the dosage used in the present study may not have been sufficient to achieve a complete prevention. Despite the only partial protective effect of ARI treatment on degenerative peripheral nerve changes in hyperglycemic BB-rats, 6 mo of treatment resulted in a more than threefold increase in regenerating nerve fibers. These data suggest that prophylactic ARI treatment may be efficacious in delaying the development of diabetic neuropathy.\r"

Expression of major histocompatibility complex (HLA in humans) class II determinants on bone surface cells may be important in local immune cell activation. In this study, expression of HLA-DR and DQ by cultured human bone cells (HBC) derived from normal trabecular bone surfaces was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis and immunoperoxidase techniques using monoclonal antibodies. A subset of HBC (10-30%) expressed DR constitutively while 5-15% displayed DQ during long-term culture. HBC lacked a number of monocyte and lymphocyte markers. In addition, both DR+ and DR- HBC (FACS separated) produced osteocalcin stimulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (1,25(OH)2D3). This suggests that both phenotypes belong to the osteoblast lineage. The number of DR+ HBC was increased by interferon-gamma (IFN gamma; 40-95% DR+ cells) whereas DQ+ HBC remained unchanged or was slightly increased (5-20% DQ+ cells). Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D3 enhanced IFN gamma-induced DR expression and at high concentration (10(-7) M) augmented DR expression by itself. Other major osteotropic factors, parathyroid hormone, interleukin 1, and calcitonin, did not affect HBC DR expression. The findings suggest that HBC may participate in activation of the immune system and that some osteotropic factors may regulate this function.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombin increases intracellular calcium ([Ca++]i) in several cell types and causes a positive inotropic effect in the heart. We examined the mechanism of the thrombin-induced [Ca++]i increase in chick embryonic heart cells loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator, indo-1. Thrombin (1 U/ml) increased both systolic and diastolic [Ca++]i from 617 +/- 62 and 324 +/- 46 to 1041 +/- 93 and 587 +/- 38 nM, respectively. An initial rapid [Ca++]i increase was followed by a more sustained increase. There were associated increases in contraction strength, beat frequency, and action potential duration. The [Ca++]i increase was not blocked by tetrodotoxin or verapamil, but was blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml). The thrombin-induced [Ca++]i increase was partly due to intracellular calcium release, since it persisted after removal of external calcium. The [Ca++]i increase in zero calcium was more transitory than in normal calcium and was potentiated by 10 mM Li+. Thrombin also induced influx of calcium across the surface membrane, which could be monitored using Mn++ ions, which quench indo-1 fluorescence when they enter the cell. Thrombin-induced Mn++ entry was insensitive to verapamil, but was blocked by 2 mM Ni++. Thrombin increased inositol trisphosphates by 180% at 90 s and this effect was also blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Conclusion: thrombin promotes calcium entry and release in embryonic heart cells even when action potentials are inhibited. Both modes of [Ca++]i increase may be coupled to the receptor by pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins.\r"

The rat models of adjuvant arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis were investigated using proliferation assays and limiting dilution techniques to quantify the changes in reactivity of a heterogenous population of lymphocytes to the relevant antigen. Stimulation with concanavalin A for 2 d and then culture in IL-2-containing medium led to a substantial increase in the activity and frequency of the specific autoimmune T cells. Enrichment of antigen-specific T cells could be demonstrated using lymph node, spleen, or peripheral blood lymphocytes, from rats late in the course of disease. The effect was not evident in lymphocytes from the thymus. These results are relevant to the clinical application of T cell vaccination and to investigation of self-antigens in autoimmune disease.\r"

The mechanisms responsible for hyperproduction of IgE in HIE patients are presently unknown. We investigated whether spontaneous in vitro IgE synthesis by PBMC from seven HIE patients was sensitive to signals (cell adhesion, T/B cell cognate interaction and lymphokines: IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-gamma) known to regulate IgE induction in normals. Our results show that, unlike IL-4 dependent IgE synthesis induced in normals, spontaneous IgE production by PBMC from HIE patients was not blocked by monoclonal antibodies to CD2, CD4, CD3, and MHC class II antigens. Furthermore, antibodies to IL-4 and IL-6 did not significantly suppress IgE production. IFN-gamma had no significant effects on spontaneous in vitro IgE synthesis. To test whether an imbalance in lymphokine production might underlie hyperproduction of IgE in HIE patients, mitogen-induced secretion of IL-4 and IFN-gamma by PBMC was assessed. No significant difference was detected between HIE patients and normal controls. Thus, ongoing IgE synthesis in the HIE syndrome is largely independent of cell-cell interactions and endogenous lymphokines, and is due to a terminally differentiated B cell population, no longer sensitive to regulatory signals.\r"

P. carinii infections are seen in patients with decreased numbers of helper T lymphocytes, suggesting that these cells are important in preventing infection. To test this hypothesis, we sought to establish experimental infection with P. carinii in mice selectively depleted of helper T lymphocytes. Weekly injections of a monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody produced sustained depletion of helper T lymphocytes from blood and lymphoid organs. To establish pulmonary infection, lymphocyte-depleted mice were then given intratracheal inoculations of P. carinii organisms derived from the lungs of chronically infected athymic mice. Pulmonary infection with P. carinii was demonstrable in the antibody-treated mice and was centered around the conducting airways. Infection was persistent for up to 3 mo with continued antibody treatments, and yet could be cleared from the lungs if antibody treatments were discontinued. This experimental model of P. carinii infection permits the study of infection associated with a specific immune defect and implicates the helper T lymphocyte as a critical cell in host defense against this pathogen.\r"

The findings reinforce the concept that histamine is the major, but not exclusive, mediator of the WFR. In contrast, histamine accounted for but a limited portion of the LCR, but 48 hours of pretreatment with three different cyclooxygenase inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, or diclofenac sodium, had but a minor influence on the WFR, whereas all drugs produced a distinct overall inhibition of the LCR. However, for indomethacin, the inhibition was preceded by a potentiation (at 1 to 2 hours), which was abolished by antihistamines, suggesting increased histamine release from skin mast cells after cyclooxygenase inhibition. Furthermore, there was synergism between indomethacin and antihistamines during the LCR, and the combination of diclofenac sodium with antihistamines produced additive inhibition. It is proposed that cyclooxygenase products, such as prostaglandins and thromboxanes, contribute to IgE-dependent skin reactions, both as modulators of mediator release and as vasoactive mediators.\r"

Efficacy was measured by physician assessment of overall disease severity based on history and physical examination at specified intervals and by the average daily patient symptom diary scores for each of three mastocytosis-related symptoms that had previously appeared to be alleviated by the use of this drug. Efficacy variables were compared for a 4-week baseline period, during which patients received open-labeled cromolyn sodium, and at 4-week intervals during a 16-week period of random assignment to cromolyn sodium or placebo. Overall disease severity and symptoms recorded in patient diaries were graded on a scale of 0 (absent) to 5 (incapacitating). The average physician assessment of disease severity and symptom scores of the patients in the placebo-treated group increased significantly during the randomization phase relative to patients in the cromolyn sodium-treated group, reflecting an exacerbation of symptoms with drug withdrawal (p less than 0.05 and less than 0.028, respectively). When the symptom scores were analyzed separately for gastrointestinal manifestations of disease (diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting), cromolyn sodium treatment was significantly beneficial relative to placebo (p less than 0.02), whereas the benefit for nongastrointestinal manifestations did not reach statistical significance.\r"

There was no difference in baseline and prechallenge FEV1 after placebo, SK&F 104353, and terfenadine administration. The median ratio of the provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 from baseline (PD20) with terfenadine over PD20 with placebo was 12.36 (range, 3.2 to 30.3; p less than 0.01) and that of PD20 with SK&F 104353 over PD20 with placebo was 1.51 (range, 0.8 to 5.9; not significant). Analysis of individual results demonstrated a shift toward the right of the dose-response curves to histamine with SK&F 104353 compared to that with placebo in three subjects, whereas the active compound did not exhibit any protective effect against histamine in the remaining nine subjects. We conclude that there is a leukotriene component to the bronchial responses to histamine in some, but not all, subjects. This component remains, however, small and does not appear to be clinically important in the population of subjects with asthma that was studied.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a potent inhibitor of IgE synthesis in rodents. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period clinical trial of human recombinant IFN-gamma in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Forty-five adults with well-documented ragweed-allergic rhinitis were randomized into three groups of 15 adults each and received subcutaneous injections three times weekly. The first treatment period (4 weeks during the off season) began on April 18, 1988; the second treatment period (6 weeks during ragweed pollination) began on August 15, 1988. All subjects received the same treatment in both periods. Group 1 received 0.2 mg per injection of IFN, group 2 received 0.02 mg of IFN, and group 3 received placebo. One subject in group 1 and three subjects in group 2 withdrew because of adverse reactions, and three subjects withdrew for personal reasons. There were no significant differences in mean weekly symptom scores or supplemental medication scores among the three groups in either treatment period. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the changes of serum IgE antibody to crude ragweed extract or in serum total IgE among the three groups during or before the ragweed-pollination season. These results indicate that this treatment regimen with IFN-gamma does not alter IgE production in patients with ragweed hay fever and indicate the need for further clinical research of lymphokine modulation of IgE production.\r"

  ".W": "The case of Ms. Nancy Cruzan is the first so-called \"right to die\" case to be heard by the US Supreme Court. The Missouri Supreme Court had ruled that Ms. Cruzan's parents, who are also her court-appointed guardians, cannot authorize the withdrawal of artificial hydration and nutrition from their daughter. Ms. Cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state since an auto accident more than six years ago. Even though Ms. Cruzan is only 32 years old, the decision in her case will have serious implications for care of the elderly. Key features of the Missouri Supreme Court decision include their claims that (1) the authority for surrogate decision-making flows from the parens patriae power of the State rather than from the authority of the incompetent person, (2) the State has an unqualified interest in the preservation of life, and (3) the medical provision of nutrition and hydration ought to be considered differently than other forms of medical treatment. Such claims are at considerable variance from accepted standards of ethically defensible decision-making that focus on the well-being of the patient understood according to the patient's own values and life goals. If the US Supreme Court restricts decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatment according to patient prognosis, capacity for decision-making, type of treatment, or state of residence, then a patient-centered standard of medical decision-making will be impossible to sustain and the maximization of life extension will be required without regard to the suffering thereby imposed.\r"

  ".W": "T cell somatic hybrids were obtained by fusion of human tetanus toxoid-specific gamma + delta + T cells and a T cell lymphoma cell line that expresses beta-chain but not alpha-chain transcripts. The hybrids simultaneously and independently expressed alpha beta and gamma delta TCR heterodimers on the cell surface without any significant differences in the level of expression. No heterodimers containing alpha delta-, beta delta-, beta gamma-, and alpha gamma-chains were transported to the cell membrane, indicating a chain specificity in dimer formation. The presence of productively rearranged gamma- and delta-alleles in the hybrid cells and immunoprecipitation of an identical type of TCR-gamma delta from both hybrid and parental gamma + delta + T cells suggests that TCR-gamma delta on the hybrid cells derives from gamma + delta + T cells. Anti-TCR (TCS-delta 1 or WT31) and anti-CD3 antibodies induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i in the double-positive hybrids and their variants positive for either the alpha beta or gamma delta complex. Double positive hybrid cells were refractory to stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody after pretreatment with a mixture of anti-TCR-gamma delta and anti-TCR-alpha beta antibodies but not with either antibody alone indicating the functional independence of the two receptors. However, only gamma delta heterodimer receptor was able to respond to tetanus toxoid presented on autologous APC as measured by induction of the p55 chain of IL-2R on stimulated cells.\r"

  ".U": "90237475\r", 
  ".W": "Cross-linking class II molecules on resting human B cells can initiate phosphatidyl inositol turnover and an increase in intracellular calcium concentration levels comparable with that seen with the cross-linking of surface Ig receptors. The calcium response is most evident on dense B cell fractions: buoyant cells are less responsive, even though the levels of class II expression are similar on dense and buoyant tonsillar B cells. Human B cell lines exhibit the same absence of correlation between intensity of the calcium signal and levels of surface class II expression, indicating that responsiveness is related to the state of differentiation of the cell rather than the amount of class II expressed. Cross-linking class II on normal B cells or B cell lines caused accumulation of inositol phosphates, suggesting class II induces calcium release from intracellular stores, rather than through direct regulation of calcium channels. The calcium response mediated through class II was completely abolished by bringing the protein tyrosine phosphatase, CD45, into close proximity with surface class II. This result indicated that protein tyrosine phosphorylation might regulate the signal transduced through this molecule. In support of this notion we found that tyrosine phosphorylation is induced when small dense tonsillar B cells are stimulated with either anti-Ig or with antibodies to class II. Finally, in B cell proliferation assays we show that cross-linking class II molecules on dense tonsillar B cells synergize strongly with suboptimal concentrations of PMA or IL-4. The significance of these results is discussed with regard to the cognate signal between B and T lymphocytes.\r"

These primates usually are born as dizygotic twins and, due to placental vascular anastomoses, develop sharing each others' bone marrow elements. Strikingly, almost 50% of the PBL of a member of a twin pair are derived from the hematopoietic stem cells of its cotwin. To clarify the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of tolerance in these stable chimeras, MHC gene products have been biochemically characterized in cloned, genetically distinct, male and female lymphocytes from two male/female cotton-top tamarin twin pairs. Extensive MHC class II sharing between the genetically distinct cell populations was not seen in the two twin pairs. This was consistent with the MHC class II polymorphism seen in the species. However, the MHC class I gene products expressed by one member of a twin pair were almost identical to those expressed by its cotwin. A human minisatellite probe demonstrated restriction fragment length polymorphism in DNA from these animals, indicating extensive polymorphism. Thus, MHC class I sharing did not occur due to inbreeding in these animals. Additionally, another bone marrow-chimeric primate species, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), expresses MHC class I molecules with low levels of variation. These studies suggest that the stable chimerism of bone marrow-chimeric primates may be facilitated by MHC class I similarity between the genetically distinct bone marrow derived-cell populations in their circulation.\r"

Thymic regeneration after irradiation is the product of a limited pool of intrathymic radioresistant stem cells undergoing simultaneous differentiation. We show that in this model of T cell development, thymic regeneration follows a pathway in which the IL-2R is transiently expressed on CD4-/CD8- cells. IL-2R expression occurred during the exponential growth period of thymic regeneration, and IL-2R blocking prevented this explosive growth. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the IL-2R blockade affected primarily the development of the immature CD3-/CD4-/CD8- (triple negative) cells and their ability to generate CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ or CD3+/CD4+/CD8- and CD3+/CD4-/CD8+ thymocytes. Thus, our findings demonstrate that blocking of the IL-2R resulted in an arrest in proliferation and differentiation by intrathymic radioresistant stem cells, indicating that the IL-2/IL-2R pathway is necessary for the expansion of immature triple negative T cells.\r"

To determine the origin of these expanded populations of lpr and gld T cells, we examined the expression of CD2 molecules and mRNA transcripts in association with other cell surface phenotypes of these cells and correlated them with subpopulations of DN T cells in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissues. The results indicated that both lpr and gld cells are negative for the transcript and product of the CD2 gene. Both lpr and gld DN T cells were CD2-, CD3+, CD4-, CD8-, CD25-, CD45R+, TCR alpha/beta+, TCR gamma/delta-, HSA(J11d)-/+, Thy-1+/-, and Lp-1-/+. Studies of thymocytes in normal mice using three-color flow cytometry analysis showed that there are at least eight phenotypically distinct populations of DN thymocytes, one of which is similar to lpr and gld cells in terms of CD2-, CD3+, TCR alpha/beta+ and CD25- phenotypes, although they did not express CD45R, HSA, or Lp-1. A very minor population of these CD2-CD3+ TCR alpha/beta+ DN T cells were also detected in peripheral T cells from normal mice. These findings may provide insight into not only the origin of the aberrant lpr and gld T cells but also normal T cell development.\r"

In our study we examine the expression of lymphokine genes in mitogen-activated T cells from four patients with CVI. T cells from patients with CVI did not differ significantly from normals in total T cell number, CD4/CD8 ratio, CD45R expression, or proliferation in response to PHA. However, T cells from this group of patients did exhibit significant abnormalities of mitogen-induced lymphokine gene expression. T cells from patients exhibited significantly decreased expression of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-gamma when compared to normal controls. In contrast to these abnormal findings, mitogen-activated T cells from patients with CVI expressed normal amounts of IL-2R alpha and c-myc suggesting that these patients have a selective abnormality of T cell activation. Furthermore, it is likely that the deficient production of IFN-gamma by patient T cells is partially due to the abnormality of IL-2 production as the levels of IFN-gamma mRNA detected during the initial IL-2-independent phase of T cell activation were normal and the addition of exogenous rIL-2 was able to normalize IFN-gamma production by PHA-stimulated patient cells. Finally, supernatants from PHA-activated cultures of patients PBMC were deficient in their ability to support Ig secretion by Staphylococcus A Cowan's-activated normal B cells suggesting that these T cell abnormalities may contribute to the pathogenesis of this syndrome.\r"

Immunization with tetanus toxoid induced predominantly IgG antibody responses in serum and in the PBMC. The IgA antibody response was low, and was mostly of the IgA1 subclass. In contrast, immunization with polysaccharide Ag (Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, C, Y, W-135, and Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides) elicited a major IgA response predominantly of the IgA2 isotype. Analysis of the molecular forms of secreted IgA antibodies indicated that polymers were produced early after immunization, irrespective of the nature of the Ag. When compared with serum antibody and to PBMC cell responses, systemic immunization with polysaccharides induced a minor salivary response dominated by IgG and IgM antibodies. In contrast, the presence of antipolysaccharide antibodies in bile, irrespective of their isotype, paralleled the serum response 14 days after the immunization with polysaccharide Ag. These results suggest that biliary Ig were mostly derived from serum. Different patterns of the expression of MHC class II Ag on T cells, B cells, and monocytes during the course of immunization with protein or polysaccharide Ag were observed: whereas protein Ag induced a high frequency of HLA-DP- and HLA-DR-expressing cells early in the course of immunization, polysaccharide vaccines elicited low and protracted increases of HLA-DP+ T cells. Polysaccharide vaccine covalently coupled to a protein carrier induced a higher frequency of antipolysaccharide antibody-secreting cells in peripheral blood and increased the IgG to IgA ratio among polysaccharide-specific antibody-secreting cells.\r"

Recently, we and others have shown that rat and human hepatoma cells express IL-6 mRNA, and the question arose as to whether normal hepatocytes express IL-6 and whether any such expression occurs under normal physiologic conditions or is seen in inflammation. Poly A+ mRNA of liver from normal rats and from rats undergoing an acute phase response was not positive when probed with cDNA for rat IL-6 under conditions in which macrophage mRNA was strongly positive. We then compared poly A+ mRNA from purified hepatocytes freshly isolated from normal rats--from rats that were undergoing an acute inflammatory response and from freshly isolated normal hepatocytes that had been cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (microM). Only the mRNA from normal hepatocytes cultured for 24 h in the absence of any glucocorticoid was obviously positive for IL-6. The increased expression of gamma-fibrinogen mRNA indicated the presence of inflammation. These results confirm the identification of IL-6 as an exogenous hormone for regulating normal hepatic acute phase protein synthesis in inflammation and rules out an autocrine mechanism being active in the liver in normal homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) synthesize and secrete C component factors H and C3. Addition of T cell growth factor to HUVEC enhanced factor H production, and caused a profound increase in C3 production. In the present study, investigations were initiated to characterize the effects of purified rIL-1 and rIFN-gamma on the production of factor H and C3 at the protein and mRNA level. IFN-gamma enhanced factor H production in a dose-dependent fashion and a two-fold increase was observed with an optimal dose of 200 U/ml, whereas IFN-gamma had no effect on C3 production. IL-1 inhibited factor H secretion, but the production of C3 was increased 10-fold at an optimal dose of 500 pg/ml of IL-1. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that addition of IL-1 to HUVEC resulted in an induction of C3 production after more than 24 h, whereas IFN-gamma already had a significant effect on factor H production after 8 h of culture. IL-1 in combination with IFN-gamma had a synergistic effect on C3 production. The effects of IL-1 and IFN-gamma on factor H and C3 production by HUVEC could be blocked by using neutralizing amounts of antibodies specific for these cytokines. Northern blot analysis showed that factor H mRNA expression was enhanced in IFN-gamma-treated HUVEC and C3 mRNA was induced in IL-1-treated HUVEC, indicating that the observed increase of factor H and C3 probably is controlled by enhancement of transcription or stability of the transcript.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) and a series of CsA analogs that bind with decreasing affinity to cyclophilin, to evaluate the involvement of this protein in the release of preformed (histamine) and de novo synthesized (peptide leukotriene C4; LTC4) mediators of inflammatory reactions from human basophils. CsA (8 to 800 nM) concentration-dependently inhibited (5 to 60%) histamine release from peripheral blood basophils challenged with anti-IgE. CsA was more potent (92.6 +/- 1.8 vs 59.1 +/- 4.5%; p less than 0.001) and, at low concentrations, more effective when the channel-operated influx of Ca2+ was bypassed by the ionophore A23187 (IC40 = 24.1 +/- 3.9 vs 105.5 +/- 22.2 nM; p less than 0.05). CsA had no effect on the release of histamine caused by phorbol myristate and bryostatin 1 that activate different isoforms of protein kinase C. Inhibition of histamine release from basophils challenged with anti-IgE was not abolished by washing (three times) the cells before anti-IgE challenge. CsA also inhibited the de novo synthesis of LTC4 from basophils challenged with anti-IgE. The inhibitory effect of CsA was very rapid, and the drug, added from 1 to 10 min during the reaction, inhibited the ongoing release of histamine caused by anti-IgE and by A23187. The experiments with CsA analogs (CsG, CsC, CsD, and CsH) showed that CsH, which has an extremely low affinity for cyclophilin, has no effect on basophil mediator release. In addition, there is a significant correlation between the concentrations of CsA, G, C, and D that inhibited by 30% the histamine release induced by anti-IgE (r = 0.99; p less than 0.001) and by A23187 (r = 0.87; p less than 0.001) and their affinity for cyclophilin.\r"

Calcium ionophores are also well known for their ability to prime phagocytic cells. In the current studies, nonelicited rat alveolar macrophages were analyzed for the ability of ATP as well as FMLP, C5a, platelet-activating factor and calcium ionophore (A23187) to modify levels of intracellular calcium and to enhance superoxide anion (O2-) production in response to immune complexes. Although none of these agents induced a O2- response under the conditions employed, all, except FMLP and C5a (human, recombinant) increased intracellular calcium, although the temporal features of the increases varied with the agent. In contrast to the inability of FMLP and C5a to cause intracellular calcium increases in macrophages, these same peptides caused dose-dependent intracellular calcium increases in rat neutrophils, whether the cells were derived from the blood or from the peritoneal cavity. On the basis of the effects of EGTA, the calcium increases in alveolar macrophages were caused by intracellular release of calcium in addition to some influx of extracellular calcium. Although ATP caused a dose-related increase in the level of intracellular calcium in alveolar macrophages, the cells were not \"primed\" for enhanced O2- responses to immune complexes. In contrast, platelet-activating factor and A23187, each of which induced increased intracellular levels of calcium, were able to prime macrophages for enhanced O2- responses. C5a and FMLP neither increased intracellular calcium levels nor primed macrophages for enhanced O2- responses to immune complexes. It is not clear if the inability of ATP to prime alveolar macrophages is caused entirely by insufficient increases in intracellular calcium or if ATP is unable to bring about additional changes that are relevant to the priming phenomenon.\r"

  ".U": "90237507\r", 
  ".W": "The widely accepted hypothesis that the increased 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) in stimulated cells is derived from phosphoinositides was tested by comparing the pattern of molecular species of phosphatidylinositol (PI) to that of DAG in mast cells. For any glycerol-based lipid, molecular species are defined by unique combinations of the two fatty acids esterified to glycerol. The quantitative frequency distribution of these molecular species represent a \"fingerprint\" that provides a sensitive approach to assessing precursor/product relationships. Based on mass, the molecular species fingerprints PI, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine were determined in unstimulated mast cells and compared to that of the DAG found after stimulation by IgE R bridging, compound 48/80 and the Ca+2 ionophore A23187. The molecular species fingerprint of DAG before stimulation was quite different from that of PI.IgE R cross-linking caused a 1.5 to 2-fold increase in DAG mass 1 to 3 min after stimulation with a concomitant shift in the pattern of DAG molecular species to one that bore only a partial resemblance to that of PI suggesting that considerably less than half of the incremental DAG is likely derived from PI. Ten to 20 min after Ag challenge, DAG levels became maximal (3.2- and 2.9-fold, respectively), but its molecular species pattern returned toward that seen in unstimulated cells suggesting that only perhaps 25% of the incremental DAG might be derived from PI. The molecular species fingerprint of DAG much more closely resembled that PC suggesting that as much as 75% of the incremental DAG might be derived from PC. Similar observations were made when 48/80 and A23187 were used as secretory agonists. These experiments indicate that the DAG participating in the \"phosphoinositide cycle\" represents a quantitatively modest fraction of the DAG accumulating in stimulated mast cells and suggest that mechanisms other than PI hydrolysis, including perhaps a \"PC cycle,\" are more important than previously assumed in causing the rise in DAG during activation.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet contain Fc gamma RII. However, little is known about how the expression of these receptors is regulated. Inasmuch as platelet activation by a variety of agonists increases the expression of several proteins on the platelet surface, we used flow cytometry to study the effect of platelet activation on the expression of platelet Fc gamma R by measuring the binding of fluorescein-labeled oligomeric IgG (FITC-IgG oligomer) and fluorescein-labeled mAb IV.3 (FITC-IV.3), a mAb that recognizes Fc gamma RII, to platelets. The number of Fc gamma R per platelet was determined by relating the binding to platelets of FITC-IV.3, measured by flow cytometry, to the binding of 125I-labeled IV.3, measured using a standard filtration assay. Nonactivated, gel-filtered platelets from nine healthy donors expressed a mean of 891 Fc gamma R per platelet, whereas platelets activated at 25 degrees C by thrombin or PMA expressed a mean of 1382 Fc gamma R an average increase of 55% (p less than 0.001). Binding of FITC-IgG oligomer increased to a similar extent when platelets were stimulated by these agonists. A smaller increase in the number of Fc gamma R expressed on the platelet surface was measured when platelets were stimulated with ADP, though no increase was observed with epinephrine. The agonist-dependent increase in Fc gamma R expression did not occur when platelets were studied at 4 degrees C or in the presence of agents that elevate intracellular levels of cAMP, suggesting that platelet activation was required for this process. Agonist-stimulated Fc gamma R expression did not depend on dense-granule secretion, because it was observed at low agonist concentrations in the absence of 14C-serotonin release. These studies demonstrate that the number of Fc gamma R expressed on the platelet surface increases when platelets are activated by several agonists, perhaps as a result of the exposure of Fc gamma R located along the surface-connected open canalicular system, or the fusion of platelet alpha-granule and plasma membranes during the activation process. Increased Fc gamma R expression may promote the clearance of IgG-containing immune complexes from the circulation, and contribute to the development of immune complex-mediated thrombocytopenia.\r"

All classes of lymphocytes are involved. A similar, but much smaller, expansion in cell numbers occurs after exposure to a comparable dilution of normal chick allantoic fluid. In the control group, this increase in lymph node size is totally prevented by the in vivo depletion of CD4+ T cells whereas there is only a 50% reduction in the virus-infected mice. The lymphocyte component of the cellular exudate in the lungs of infected mice is dominated by activated, CD8+ T cells, which are also prevalent in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Elimination of the CD4+ subset does not greatly diminish the severity of this inflammatory process. The CD4-depleted mice clear the virus from the lung, and there is little effect on the frequency of virus-specific, cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors in either the lymph node or the lung. Substantial involvement of CD4+ T cells is not essential for the development of effective cell-mediated immunity in mice with influenza.\r"

  ".W": "Immunologic screening of cDNA expression libraries has been widely used for the identification of DNA sequences encoding the immunologically relevant proteins of many pathogenic microorganisms. For reasons that are not entirely clear, sequences encoding 70-kDa heat shock and related proteins (hsp70), which are among the most highly conserved proteins known, have routinely been identified by this approach. Consequently, hsp70 proteins have been proposed to be involved in the autoimmune processes thought responsible for the pathogenesis of the diseases caused by some of these organisms, e.g., chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection (Chagas' disease). Therefore, we investigated whether hsp70 might be a specific target of the human humoral immune response to T. cruzi infection, and, if so, whether humoral autoimmunity to hsp70 might play a role in pathogenesis. We found that hsp70 is indeed a major polypeptide Ag in Chagas' disease, but that the antibodies to T. cruzi hsp70 do not react with human hsp70--even though the proteins display 73% amino acid sequence identify. These results indicate that self-tolerance to hsp70 is maintained during chronic T. cruzi infection and strongly argue against a role for humoral autoimmunity to hsp70 in the pathogenesis of Chagas' disease.\r"

  ".W": "These studies explore the suppression of resistance to schistosomiasis mansoni through interactions of autologous immune functions derived from an induced anti-idiotypic response. This anti-clonotypic response is induced by immunization with syngeneic L3T4+ receptor-bearing lymphoblasts and for the sake of description is termed \"auto-anti-idiotypic\". It is antigenically restricted and cannot be induced by allogeneic cells. Anti-idiotypic immunization profoundly suppressed the development of protective immunity after exposure to irradiated cercariae and altered a wide variety of functional humoral and cellular immune responses to the parasite. In addition to quantitative suppressive effects, the anti-idiotypic network also regulated qualitative aspects of the immune response by increasing the heterogeneity and reducing the functional binding avidity of antibody for Ag. These effects also were reflected in analogous alterations in cellular reactivity, using the criteria of the Ag mediated blast transformation and delayed type hypersensitivity. Thus idiotypic regulation can mold the specificity and sensitivity of the immune response to Schistosoma mansoni by affecting quantitative and qualitative responses. Manipulation of idiotypic recognition provides an approach to optimize the expression of protective resistance to schistosomiasis.\r"

Ovarian response, as measured by oocytes recovered and maximum estradiol levels observed, was significantly improved in all groups and this was associated with a prolonged follicular phase, significantly more human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) stimulation and a relatively high incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation, particularly in pregnant patients. Of specific techniques in the GnRHa cycle, GIFT produced a pregnancy rate per treatment of 50% (10/20); IVF-ET, 22% (8/36); PROST, 28% (13/46); and TEST, 19% (3/16). No cycles were abandoned, compared with a cancellation rate of 24% in previous cycles without GnRHa. Patients with PCO performed particularly well on GnRHa management, with a pregnancy rate per treatment of 58% (7/12). Pregnancy rates per treatment for the other groups were as follows: elevated age, 27% (9/33), high androgens, 40% (2/5); premature LH surges, 32% (9/28); and poor responders, 17.5% (7/40).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
