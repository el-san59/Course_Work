  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although the antiviral agent ribavirin improves the course of lower respiratory tract disease in spontaneously breathing infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection, it is not known whether ribavirin can benefit infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus disease who require mechanical ventilation. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of ribavirin (20 mg per milliliter) administered continuously in aerosolized form to infants receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure that was caused by documented respiratory syncytial virus infection. RESULTS. Of the 28 infants (mean [+/- SD] age, 1.4 +/- 1.7 months) enrolled, 7 had underlying diseases predisposing them to severe infection (mean age, 3.0 +/- 2.6 months), and 21 were previously normal (mean age, 0.8 +/- 0.9 month). Among the 14 infants who received ribavirin, the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 4.9 days (as compared with 9.9 days among the 14 who received placebo; P = 0.01), and the mean length of supplemental oxygen use was 8.7 days (as compared with 13.5 days; P = 0.01). The mean length of the hospital stay was 13.3 days after treatment with ribavirin and 15.0 with placebo (P = 0.04). When only the 21 previously normal infants were considered, the mean length of the hospital stay was 9.0 days for the ribavirin recipients and 15.3 days for those who received placebo (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS. In infants who require mechanical ventilation because of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, treatment with aerosolized ribavirin decreases the duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen treatment, and the hospital stay.\r"

  ".U": "91260875\r", 
  ".W": "The positive inotropic effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart is partly mediated by an increase in the voltage-gated Ca2+ current (ICa). This increase is generally attributed to beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of the Ca2+ channel. It has been suggested that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation cannot explain all the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists on ICa and that a parallel membrane-delimited pathway involving the 'direct' action of the G protein Gs also stimulates ICa. A precedent exists for such a membrane-delimited pathway in the activation of a K+ channel by acetylcholine in heart. A membrane-delimited pathway for stimulation of ICa might be important in rapid beat-to-beat regulation of contraction by the sympathetic nervous system, because isoproterenol may produce a biphasic increase in ICa with the rapid phase (tau = 150 ms) putatively mediated by the direct pathway and the slow phase (tau = 35 s) by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. Here we report that in frog, rat, and guinea pig ventricular myocytes ICa increases slowly and monophasically in response to isoproterenol. The increase is completely blocked by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. Furthermore, the time course of the increase in ICa closely parallels the increase in contractile force produced by sympathetic nerve stimulation. These data refute earlier suggestions that regulation of Ca2+ channels by the sympathetic nervous system involves or requires a direct G-protein pathway.\r"

  ".U": "91260876\r", 
  ".W": "The ras-encoded p21ras proteins bind GTP very tightly, but catalyse hydrolysis to GDP very slowly. In humans, two genes encode proteins that stimulate this GTPase activity (GAP, or GTPase-activating proteins), one of relative molecular mass 120,000, referred to as p120-GAP, and another NF1-GAP, which is encoded by the neurofibromatosis type-1 gene. Both GAPs are widely expressed in mammalian tissues. Here we show that although they will both bind oncogenic mutants of p21ras, neither will stimulate their GTPase activity. NF1-GAP binds to the p21ras proteins up to 300 times more efficiently than p120-GAP. The two GAPs are inhibited to different extents by certain lipids: micromolar concentrations of arachidonate, phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate affect only NF1-GAP. This inhibition does not compete with p21ras, and lipid-inactivated NF1-GAP can still bind p21ras. We used the detergent dodecyl maltoside, which inhibits only NF1-GAP, to distinguish between the two activities in cell extracts and found both types present together in several mammalian cell lines. In contrast, GAP activity in extracts of Xenopus oocytes was not affected by dodecyl maltoside. By these criteria, the mammalian cells contain both GAP activities and the oocytes have only p120-like GAP activity. These results indicate that more than one GAP regulates p21ras in the same cell.\r"

It is thought to be responsible for retrograde axonal transport and other aspects of organelle motility and may have a role in the poleward movement of mitotic chromosomes. Cytoplasmic dynein is an oligomeric complex of two catalytic heavy chains and a number of accessory subunits. We now report the cloning and sequencing of a complementary DNA for one of these species, a cytoplasmic dynein-associated polypeptide of relative molecular mass 150,000 (Mr 150K). A full-length cDNA was found to contain an open reading frame of 4.0 kilobases, which is predicted to encode a polypeptide of Mr 145K. It has extensive homology with the product of the Drosophila gene Glued, which encodes a polypeptide of Mr 148K. The Glued mutation is dominant, with pleiotropic developmental defects in heterozygotes and an embryonic lethal phenotype in homozygotes. As dominant mutations may involve disruption of normal protein-protein interactions, the Glued mutation should provide insight into the mode of action of cytoplasmic dynein in vivo.\r"

Cloning and sequencing of rat brain dynamin complementary DNA identified an N-terminal region of about 300 amino acids which contained the three consensus elements characteristic of GTP-binding proteins. Extensive homology was found between this domain and the mammalian Mx proteins which are involved in interferon-induced viral resistance, and with the product of the VPS1 locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has been implicated both in membrane protein sorting, and in meiotic spindle pole separation. Dynamin-containing microtubule bundles were not observed in an immunofluorescence study of cultured mammalian cells, but a role for a GTP-requiring protein in intermicrotubule sliding during mitosis in plants has been reported. We report here that Drosophila melanogaster contains multiple tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated forms of dynamin, which are products of the shibire locus previously implicated in endocytic protein sorting.\r"

We measured soluble CD8 (sCD8) levels in the CSF of patients with MS, other inflammatory neurologic diseases (INDs), and noninflammatory neurologic diseases (NINDs). sCD8 levels in the CSF of MS and IND patients were elevated compared with NIND patients. Patients with acute infections of the CNS showed the highest absolute values of sCD8, but the amount of sCD8 per CSF white blood cell was greatest in MS and NIND patients. We found no difference in serum sCD8 levels among the groups. In MS, the combination of increased CSF sCD8 levels and sCD8 per cell may reflect CD8 T-lymphocyte activation within the brain or immunodysregulation confined to the CNS.\r"

Although oral contraceptives have been useful for the treatment of androgen excess, little is known of the independent effects of the various progestins and estrogens on inhibition of skin 5 alpha-reductase activity. We incubated minces of normal genital and pubic skin with physiologic concentrations of 3H-testosterone to assess 5 alpha-reductase activity by its conversion to 3H-dihydrotestosterone. In separate experiments, 5 alpha-reductase activity was assessed before and after the addition of progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, levonorgestrel, norethindrone, 17 beta-estradiol, and ethinyl estradiol. Progesterone, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone demonstrated 97 +/- 5.3%, 47.9 +/- 6.3%, and 59 +/- 4.6% inhibition, respectively, of genital skin 5 alpha-reductase activity at 10(-4) mol/L (P less than .01). Medroxyprogesterone acetate, however, failed to affect 5 alpha-reductase activity at similar doses. Estradiol exhibited 40.8 +/- 14.2% inhibition at 10(-4) mol/L (P less than .01), whereas ethinyl estradiol at concentrations from 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L failed to inhibit 5 alpha-reductase activity. We conclude that progesterone and the 19-nor-derivatives inhibit 5 alpha-reductase activity at high doses, whereas medroxyprogesterone acetate does not. Therefore, the 19-nor-progestin component may expand the usefulness of oral contraceptives in the treatment of hirsutism by an inhibitory action on skin 5 alpha-reductase activity.\r"

In term labor and in true preterm labor, fetal breathing movements were markedly decreased and could not be induced by maternal hypercapnia. Among women with suspected preterm labor, initial absence of fetal breathing movements and failure to evoke this response by maternal hypercapnia predicted delivery within 48 hours with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 95.5%. Induced maternal hypercapnia fails to stimulate fetal breathing movements in true term and preterm labor and may assist in distinguishing between true and false preterm labor.\r"

Serum gonadotropins and E2 levels were measured serially, and postmenopausal symptoms were prospectively recorded. Administration of 0.2 mg transdermal E2 immediately after surgery suppressed the post-castration rise in gonadotropins for at least 4 days, but LH and FSH levels did increase to the menopausal range after 2 weeks despite continued therapy. Sustained circulating levels of E2 with transdermal E2 therapy were comparable to follicular phase values. Vasomotor symptoms were well controlled by 0.2 mg of transdermal E2 in the majority of patients during the clinical trial. There was no significant estrogen-related morbidity despite the large doses used. Two patients had skin irritation at the patch site causing discontinuation of therapy. These data suggest that large doses of transdermal E2 can suppress gonadotropin levels only for a brief interval. We were unable to demonstrate any long-term alteration in the hypothalamic-pituitary set point for sensitivity to exogenous E2.\r"

  ".W": "The nitrovasodilators, nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside, cause both arterial and venous smooth muscle dilation by the intracellular release of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an accumulation of cyclic GMP. The endogenous formation of nitric oxide results in vasodilatory activity similar to the nitrovasodilators. Nitroglycerin is commonly used in the treatment of angina pectoris because of its ability to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption. Most likely, this response occurs as a result of a reduction in preload, which can decrease arterial wall tension and improve coronary blood flow. This pharmacologic effect warrants the use of nitroglycerin in the treatment of myocardial ischemia or infarction, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. Sodium nitroprusside is effective in reducing arterial blood pressure in hypertensive crisis as a result of systemic vasodilation leading to a reduction in preload and afterload. Sodium nitroprusside is not as effective in the treatment of angina pectoris or in diminishing of myocardial ischemia because it does not preferentially improve blood flow to ischemic myocardium over nonischemic myocardium. Inhibition of platelet aggregation has been demonstrated with these drugs, but the clinical applications need further investigation. Nursing interventions for the patient on nitrovasodilator therapy include careful hemodynamic monitoring and drug infusion, along with elimination of physical and emotional stimuli that can aggravate the patient's underlying pathology.\r"

To provide these data, we reviewed the records for four one-week periods (January, April, July, and October) of a large pediatric emergency department to describe the population in terms of age, chief complaints, diagnoses, time of arrival, seasonal variation, and disposition. There were 3796 log entries. Complete information on all variables was obtained on 3784 patients. Age ranged from one day to 39 years, and the mean age was 6.0 +/- 6.15 years. One half of all emergency department visits were by children three years old or younger. On the other hand, 12% of visits were by adolescents (ages 13 to 18), and one in 25 visits was made by an adult (greater than 18 years old). The majority of chief complaints and final diagnoses were related to infection and trauma. More than half of the patients arrived on the evening shift, between 4 pm and 12 am. Eleven percent of the children seen on day and evening shifts and 13% from the night shift were admitted. From the analysis of our data we recommend expanded skills in the management of minor trauma for pediatric residents, an emphasis on management of infections for nonpediatric emergency specialists, and extensive training in both pediatric and adult trauma for physicians in pediatric emergency medicine fellowships.\r"

When compared with a population of 78 normal children, the infected children were more likely to present with cough, difficulty in breathing, and lethargy. Pneumonia, diarrhea, and dehydration were more common diagnoses in the infected children, who were more likely to be admitted, had more invasive procedures, and required more professional staff to provide care. There was no significant difference in the frequency of visits (visits/month of age) when comparing the two groups. As expected, the infected children presented with problems associated with pediatric HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest that HIV-1-infected children require an increased level of care in the emergency department and subsequent admission to the hospital. These children did not visit the emergency department more frequently than the controls. This may be the result of an active outpatient HIV clinic in our hospital, which is available to both scheduled and unscheduled patients.\r"

Deletion by programmed cell death (apoptosis) is triggered if a T cell that has received a signal through its T cell receptor complex also receives a signal through the alpha 3 domain of its class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. Such a signal can be delivered by a CD8 molecule, which recognizes the alpha 3 domain, or by an antibody to this domain. Precursors of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL's) and T helper cells are sensitive to this signal but become resistant at some point before completing differentiation into functioning CTL's or T helper cells. Because CTL's carry CD8, they can induce cell death in T cells that recognize them. This pathway may be important in both removal of autoreactive T cells and immunoregulation.\r"

CREB residue Ser133 was the major site of phosphorylation by the CaM kinases in vitro and of phosphorylation after membrane depolarization in vivo.

Infectious prion particles are composed largely, if not entirely, of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein, which is encoded by a chromosomal gene. A posttranslational process, as yet unidentified, converts the cellular prion protein into an abnormal isoform. Scrapie incubation times, neuropathology, and prion synthesis in transgenic mice are controlled by the prion protein gene. Point mutations in the prion protein genes of animals and humans are genetically linked to development of neuro-degeneration. Transgenic mice expressing mutant prion proteins spontaneously develop neurologic dysfunction and spongiform neuropathology. Understanding prion diseases may advance investigations of other neurodegenerative disorders and of the processes by which neurons differentiate, function for decades, and then grow senescent.\r"

The Ypt1 protein was found on the outer side of these vesicles. The transport process is completed by fusion of these vesicles with the acceptor compartment, and Ypt1 protein activity was needed for this step. Thus, a specific GTP-binding protein is required for either attachment or fusion (or both) of secretory vesicles with the acceptor compartment during protein secretion.\r"

Preoperative nutritional support should be delivered via the gastrointestinal tract whenever feasible, generally in the form of enteral diets, which can be given via a feeding tube or as a dietary supplement. Patients with a functional gut who cannot eat because of anorexia or upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction are candidates for preoperative tube feedings. Total parenteral nutrition should be the mainstay of nutritional support when the gastrointestinal tract cannot be used adequately. An improvement in nutritional indices (e.g., serum transferrin, lymphocyte count) may be associated with decreased perioperative morbidity, although the strength of this relation is not clear. In the absence of improvement in such indices, the duration of nutritional support required to decrease operative morbidity is unknown. Postoperatively, enteral tube feedings (delivered via a nasojejunal tube or feeding jejunostomy) should be provided to all preoperatively malnourished patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract who are unable to consume adequate calories orally. Postoperative TPN should be reserved for malnourished patients with a nonfunctional gut or for patients who develop a postoperative complication that precludes enteral feeding. Current nutritional formulas have often neglected the metabolic and nutritional requirements of the intestinal tract. In the future, the combined use of specific nutrients and growth factors may improve nutritional rehabilitation in catabolic patients.\r"

Such surgery has the potential to cause significant nutritional consequences affecting patient outcome. Often, patients present malnourished preoperatively because of their chronic gastrointestinal disease, advanced age, or comorbidity. Still others are at great risk for developing malnutrition postoperatively secondary to the hypercatabolism of prolonged illness or postoperative complications. In addition, the surgical alterations of the gastrointestinal tract might disrupt normal function sufficiently to result in chronic nutritional deficiencies. Because starvation is no longer an acceptable condition, these concerns need to be recognized prior to surgery, and if indicated, nutritional support must be initiated preoperatively. Placement of feeding jejunostomy catheters for early enteral support should be considered for all high-risk patients. Equally important, surgeons should maintain a watch for future nutritional innovations that will improve their ability to meet patients' nutritional requirements.\r"

The role of nutritional therapy in cancer patients remains to be defined. Clearly, patients with severe malnutrition benefit from nutritional intervention. However, the benefit of nutritional therapy in less severe cases of malnutrition as an adjuvant to oncologic therapy has yet to be established.\r"

When multiple organ failure develops, the mortality rate is high, and therapy is unlikely to be effective unless the causative process (e.g., infection, low cardiac output) can be eliminated. Thus, the prevention of multiple organ failure and the prevention or early treatment of infection are paramount. Organ and nutritional support to prevent complications is necessary. The gastrointestinal tract should be used for nutrition whenever possible with a blenderized regular diet with fiber, glutamine, and short-chain fatty acids to protect and preserve the gut. If parenteral nutrition is necessary, special solutions may be necessary for the liver, kidneys, or lungs. If not, protein with 45% branched-chain amino acid, medium- and short-chain triglycerides, glutamine supplementation, and carbohydrates seem best. Other substances are being evaluated that may be helpful in nutrition and organ support, including arginine, xylitol, growth hormone, and anabolic steroids. Multiple organ failure should be prevented, if at all possible, by stopping or controlling the injury, removing as much necrotic tissue as possible, improving blood flow and oxygen consumption, supporting metabolism, and preventing infection or treating it early and adequately. Nutritional support plays a key role in preventing metabolic failure.\r"

We report 37 patients with ureteral pseudodiverticula, of whom 17 (46%) had associated uroepithelial malignancy. Ureteral pseudodiverticula were diagnosed in all patients on excretory or retrograde urography as an incidental finding during evaluation for a variety of urologic symptoms and signs. All patients were assessed with urinalysis, urine culture, cystoscopy, and when indicated, ureteroscopy. Diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was made by surgery or endoscopic biopsy in 16 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in one. In nine patients with radiographs showing ureteral pseudodiverticula and a urinary tract filling defect (usually in the bladder), 78% of the cases were proved malignant. In six patients with ureteral pseudodiverticula and a stricture in the ureter or renal collecting system, 67% of the cases were proved malignant. Of the patients with tumor, 53% had a single ureteral pseudodiverticulum. In two cases, the pseudodiverticula antedated the diagnosis of malignancy by 2 and 4 years, respectively. Our experience suggests that the association between ureteral pseudodiverticula and uroepithelial malignancy may be more common than previously assumed, approaching 50%. Even a single ureteral pseudodiverticulum should be regarded as a serious marker for potential malignancy, antedating cancer by 2-10 years, and such patients should be closely followed up. The coexistence of ureteral pseudodiverticula and a stricture or filling defect in the urinary tract is highly suggestive that a tumor is present.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow suppression is often the limiting factor in the use of radiation therapy. In order to determine if MR imaging can be used to quantify bone marrow changes, we performed a serial prospective study of patients with lung cancer (six cases) and lymphoma (six cases). Quantitative and qualitative assessments of T1-weighted sagittal images, 750/33 (TR/TE), obtained at 0.6 T before, during, and after radiotherapy showed increased signal intensity in the radiated portions of the spine. These changes appeared as early as 2 weeks after the beginning of radiation, continued to increase until a maximum value was attained, and then persisted during the follow-up period of 2 years. A significantly higher (p less than .04) ratio of pretreatment to maximum posttreatment signal intensity was seen in patients with lymphoma than in those with lung cancer, and pretreatment values in patients with lymphoma were significantly lower (p less than .01). The lower pretreatment values found in the patients with lymphoma may have been due to the smaller amount of yellow marrow in these patients, who were significantly younger (33 vs 62 years). The higher ratio of pre- and posttreatment signal intensity may have been related to the larger amount of hematopoietic marrow available to undergo fatty replacement. The persistence of elevated signal intensity for as long as 2 years after radiation suggests an endpoint in the process of marrow conversion, but not reversal in the form of regeneration of hematopoietic bone marrow. Quantitative MR evaluation of bone marrow may be of considerable value as a noninvasive means of monitoring the effects of radiotherapy.\r"

The control group (group A; n = 25) did not receive preoperative gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, but patients in Group B (n = 25) received 2 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist before undergoing hysterectomy. Patients in the two groups were similar with respect to age, gravidity, parity, pretreatment uterine size, and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Patients in group B had an increase in hemoglobin levels (10.75 to 12.12 gm/dl, p less than 0.05) and a decrease in uterine volume (1086.7 to 723.4 ml, p less than 0.05) after 8 weeks of agonist therapy and were more likely to undergo vaginal hysterectomy (76.0% vs 16%). Patients in group B also had shorter hospitalizations (5.2 vs 3.8 days, p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "An examination of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuronal cell damage may lead to the design of pharmacologic interventions during presumed or actual fetal asphyxia. Hypoxia-ischemia in its severest form results in insufficient adenosine 5'-triphosphate production. The most important effect of this is failure of adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent membrane functions, which maintain ionic homeostasis, that is, ionic pumping. There is K+ efflux and Na+ influx across the cell membrane, depolarization of the cell membrane, opening of the voltage-dependent calcium channels, and entrance of Ca++ into the cell. Cytosolic Ca++ is also increased by Ca++ efflux from the mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca++ is a toxin in high cytosolic concentrations; it activates phospholipases A and C, which cause membrane breakdown and release of free fatty acids, including arachidonic acid. The membrane is damaged, lysis occurs, and the neuron dies. High cytosolic Ca++ also causes release of excitatory amino acids (especially glutamate), which overwhelm the suppressant neurotransmitters, causing seizures, increased metabolism, and aggravation of the insufficient adenosine 5'-triphosphate availability. Thromboxane A2 is generated from arachidonic acid, increasing smooth muscle tone and thereby worsening the ischemia. Cyclooxygenase activity also results in formation of oxygen-free radicals that contribute to cell membrane damage, lysis, and death. Possibilities for pharmacologic interventions include (1) calcium channel blockers and antagonists, (2) excitatory neurotransmitter blockers, (3) oxygen-free radical scavengers (e.g., superoxide dismutase), (4) cyclooxygenase or prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, and (5) seizure suppressants (e.g., phenobarbital). Some of these treatments have been shown experimentally to limit neuronal death in the adult and fetus, and after more investigative work they may be applicable to clinical practice.\r"

Significant and at times dramatic differences among the treatment groups were found, with progestin-prepared endometrium being the least successful and leuprolide-prepared endometrium the most successful. In addition, the prolonged suppression provided for a period of time after the procedure by depot leuprolide is likely to help inhibit endometrial regeneration and provide even better long-term success of the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 17 patients with allergic asthma was challenged with aerosolized antigen, and the excretion of the peptidoleukotriene metabolite leukotriene (LT) E4 in the urine was determined as an index of leukotriene synthesis. The allergen challenge caused a drop in FEV1 of 25 to 59% within the first 2 h in all patients. This was associated with an increase in urine LTE4 excretion during the subsequent 12 h. The amount of urinary LTE4 excreted increased from a 12-h baseline level of 46 +/- 6.8 ng to a postallergen challenge level of 92 +/- 13 ng. In a similar experimental protocol methacholine challenge alone did not significantly increase urinary LTE4 excretion. In comparing all individuals as a group, there was no significant positive correlation between the magnitude of the drop in FEV1 during the immediate asthmatic response (IAR) and the increased amount of LTE4 excreted in the urine (p = 0.08). These parameters were still not significantly correlated when airways reactivity (log PC20) was also considered (p = 0.057). However, when each individual was compared to self in the presence and absence of cromoglycate, a significant correlation was found to exist between the drop in FEV1 during the IAR, the excretion of urinary LTE4, and the airways reactivity. No correlation was found between the increase in urine LTE4 excreted during the 12 h following allergen challenge and the severity of late (3 to 12 h) responses to allergen, but there was a significant prolonged (12 to 36 h) elevated urine LTE4 excretion in those patients with the most severe late asthmatic response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Serologic markers for hepatitis viruses were studied in 40 children who developed acute hepatitis during antituberculosis therapy with rifampin and isoniazid, with the aim of assessing the contributory role of these viruses toward producing hepatic injury. Hepatitis A and B were confirmed in 7.5 and 35% patients, respectively, by IgM antibodies. Epidemiologic evidence suggested the possibility of non-A, non-B hepatitis in at least a few of the remaining 23 children. Hepatitis B was seen more often in children with severe tubercular disease (72%) and was largely (92.8%) parenterally transmitted. The study highlights that the endemicity of viral hepatitis in developing countries, among other factors, could also be responsible for the reported higher incidence of hepatotoxicity from developing countries and also for the increased risk of hepatotoxicity seen in severe tubercular disease.\r"

There was no overall linkage between RA and either IgCH or D14S1. However, Gm haplotype similarity in affected siblings appeared greater in either DR4-positive as compared to DR4-negative sibships or in sibships without clinical or serological evidence of autoimmune thyroid disease when compared to sibships with such evidence. In association studies there were no associations at the D14S1 locus. Within the Ig CH region there were no overall associations. However, within the RA population G1m (z) and G3m (g) both appeared less frequent in DR4-negative RA versus both DR4-positive RA and versus control groups. Analysis of DNA variants at Ig CH loci showed differences at the gamma 4 locus with a 9.0 kb fragment appearing less frequently in DR4-positive RA versus DR4-negative RA and control groups. The results suggest a weak or HLA-DR dependent effect of genes linked to the Ig CH region on susceptibility to RA.\r"

The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases.

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of interferon therapy on hepatocyte human leukocyte antigen class I and class II antigen expression and intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (n = 11) and C (n = 10). Interferon-alpha was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 3 to 18 million international units daily for 4 wk. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained just before and immediately after treatment, and the specimens were stained by the indirect immunoperoxidase method for evaluation of human leukocyte antigen expression and lymphocyte subsets. Before therapy, no significant difference was noted between hepatitis B and C in human leukocyte antigen class I antigen expression on hepatocytes or in the lymphocyte subsets in the intralobular and portal areas. After interferon-alpha treatment, hepatocyte expression of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens and serum beta 2-microglobulin levels were virtually unchanged in chronic viral hepatitis C patients, but both were increased in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. Human leukocyte antigen class II antigens were not expressed during treatment. The mean number of intralobular CD3+ and CD8+ cells and the mean serum ALT level decreased significantly in chronic viral hepatitis C patients (p less than 0.05) but not in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. The mean number of intralobular CD4+ cells was unaffected by interferon therapy in both groups. In all 21 patients, the changes in CD8+ cell numbers paralleled the changes in serum ALT levels. Our findings suggest that T-cell cytotoxicity may play an important role in hepatocyte damage in both chronic viral hepatitis C and chronic viral hepatitis B and that the response to interferon-alpha differs in these two types of hepatitis.\r"

Hepatitis C virus RNA became undetectable after 4 to 8 wk of interferon administration in 13 of the 16 patients. During 6 mo of follow-up, 5 of the 13 patients who became negative for hepatitis C virus RNA after interferon administration remained negative, and all five continued to have normal ALT levels. Repeat liver biopsy in these five patients revealed histological improvement. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, which was initially positive in all treated patients, fell to undetectable levels in three of the five patients. In contrast, aminotransferase levels rose again in all eight patients who had become hepatitis C virus RNA negative but had again exhibited hepatitis C virus RNA after completion of therapy. In 16 untreated patients, hepatitis C virus RNA remained detectable. These results indicate that detection of hepatitis C virus RNA may be useful as a marker of viral replication in chronic hepatitis C; they also suggest that interferon should again be administered to patients who become hepatitis C virus RNA negative on treatment but again exhibit this marker of viral replication when treatment is stopped.\r"

Age-related changes in both the amounts and the intralobular distributions of these enzymes were demonstrated, and the enzymes differ in these regards: In fetal liver, P-450 IA2 and P-450 IIC were very low, when present at all, whereas P-450 IIIA, epoxide hydrolase and the reductase were already abundant and found in all the hepatocytes. During the postnatal period, P-450 IIC dramatically increased and was observed in all hepatocytes, the centrilobular ones being more intensely stained. P-450 IIIA was restricted to centrilobular and midzonal hepatocytes in normal adult liver. P-450 IA2 showed this same intralobular distribution; however, its presence was detected only several weeks or months after birth as judged both by immunohistochemical and immunoblotting techniques. Epoxide hydrolase and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase were easily visualized in all hepatocytes regardless of the age of the donor; in child and adult livers, centrilobular hepatocytes were more intensely stained. Immunoreactive protein contents and corresponding messenger RNA levels correlated well with immunohistochemical observations. No major modification was seen in fibrotic liver, whereas both positive and negative cells were observed in cirrhotic liver nodules for all enzymes studied.\r"

  ".W": "The intravenous administration of dimethylethanolamine in the rat promotes a selective enrichment of liver membranes with polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines. The effect of dimethylethanolamine pretreatment on cholestasis induced by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide, a potent cholestatic agent, was assessed in this study. Dimethylethanolamine, dissolved in sodium-taurocholate was infused intravenously (0.3 mg/kg/min) for 15 hr. One group of control rats (estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls) received the bile salt only. An estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide bolus was then injected intravenously (10.4 mg/kg) into dimethylethanolamine-pretreated and estradiol 17 beta-D-control rats, and its effect on bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was compared for 3 hr. The estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide inhibitory effect on bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was significantly antagonized by dimethylethanolamine pretreatment. The maximum inhibition of bile flow was found 30 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration, when it decreased from 3.5 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/100 gm (basal) to 0.9 +/- 0.3 microliters/min/100 gm in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls, whereas in dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats this decreased only from 3.2 +/- 0.4 (basal) to 2.3 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/100 gm. Bile flow and the biliary secretion of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine and bile salts were significantly higher in the dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats than in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls (p less than 0.02) during the cholestatic phase. The inhibitory effect of estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide on bile flow was associated with a marked decrease of membrane fluidity (p less than 0.001) assessed by 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy and with a cholesterol enrichment of microsomes, sinusoidal and canalicular liver plasma membranes and inhibition of sinusoidal Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity (p less than 0.05). These membrane alterations persisted 180 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration despite complete normalization of bile flow. Dimethylethanolamine pretreatment significantly counteracted the reduction of membrane fluidity (p less than 0.001), the cholesterol enrichment and the inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase (p less than 0.05) promoted by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration in all membrane subfractions 30 and 180 min after administration. In addition, dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats had more polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane phosphatidylcholine with respect to the control groups. Dilatation of canaliculi and loss of microvilli were evident in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls 180 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that suppression of ventricular arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs after myocardial infarction improves survival, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was initiated. Suppression was evaluated before randomization during an open label titration period. Patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed were randomized in the main study and those whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed were randomized in a substudy. Overall survival and survival free of arrhythmic death or cardiac arrest were lower [corrected] in patients treated with encainide or flecainide than in patients treated with placebo. However, the death rate in patients randomized to placebo therapy was lower than expected. This report describes the survival experience of all patients enrolled in CAST and compares it with mortality in other studies of patients with ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. As of April 18, 1989, 2,371 patients had enrolled in CAST and entered prerandomization, open label titration: 1,913 (81%) were randomized to double-blind, placebo-controlled therapy (1,775 patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed and 138 patients whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed during open label titration); and 458 patients (19%) were not randomized because they were still in titration, had died during titration or had withdrawn. Including all patients who enrolled in CAST, the actuarial (Kaplan-Meier) estimate of 1-year mortality was 10.3%. To estimate the \"natural\" mortality rate of patients enrolled in CAST, an analysis was done that adjusted for deaths that might be attributable to encainide or flecainide treatment either during prerandomization, open label drug titration or after randomization. Because the censoring procedure excluded patients treated with encainide or flecainide after randomization, the mortality estimate will be less than the unadjusted mortality estimate of 10.3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The patient characteristics and outcomes were studied in the 318 patients who survived open label drug titration in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) and who were not randomized to double-blind therapy and in 942 patients, who were randomized to double-blind placebo therapy. The patients randomized to placebo therapy had a lower total mortality or resuscitated cardiac arrest rate (4% vs. 8.5%). However, at baseline, nonrandomized patients were dissimilar from patients randomized to placebo in the following ways: older; lower left ventricular ejection fraction; greater use of digitalis, diuretic drugs and antihypertensive agents; lesser use of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and more frequent prior cardiac problems, including runs of ventricular tachycardia and left bundle branch block. A matched comparison that took these inequities into account showed no significant differences in mortality or rate of resuscitation from cardiac arrest between nonrandomized patients and clinically equivalent patients randomized to placebo. Cox regression analysis indicated that two factors significantly increased the hazard ratio for arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest in the nonrandomized patients: female gender (4.7, p less than 0.05) and electrocardiographic events (ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, widened QRS complex, heart block, bradycardia) during open label titration (7.0, p less than 0.005). However, some potentially important differences between men and women were not included in the Cox regression model. Of the nonrandomized patients, approximately 70% were not randomized because of lack of suppression of ventricular premature depolarizations or adverse events, or both, and the remaining 30% because of patient or private physician request with no indication of another reason.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most patients had severe preoperative symptoms with functional class III (39.8%) or IV (57.1%) limitation. The overall 30 day postoperative cardiac mortality rate was 15.7%. The total in-hospital mortality rate was 18.8%; the mean postoperative hospital stay was 16.4 +/- 13.3 days. The perioperative mortality rate for elective operations was as follows: coronary artery bypass (5.6%), aortic valve replacement (9.6%), aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (17.9%) and mitral valve surgery with or without coronary bypass (21.4%). Urgent operations were performed in 39 patients (20.4%) with a total perioperative mortality rate of 35.9%; urgent coronary artery bypass was performed in 26 patients (67%) with an in-hospital mortality rate of 23.1%. Clinical evidence of left ventricular failure, functional class IV symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%, mitral valve repair or replacement for severe mitral regurgitation and urgent operation were associated with an increased perioperative mortality rate. Follow-up study in all 155 patients surviving postoperative hospitalization at 22.6 +/- 14.8 months showed significant improvement in symptom status in all surgical subgroups. There were 18 follow-up deaths (11.6%); 10 were noncardiac. The actuarial survival rate of the entire study group was significantly better than that in age- and gender-matched control subjects (p = 0.037).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Athymic (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 mice have levels of potentially autoreactive V beta 3- and V beta 11-bearing T cells that are significantly higher than those of euthymic CB6F1 mice. Examination of potentially autoreactive cells in athymic AKR mice, however, yielded contrasting results. V beta 6+ cells, which are deleted intrathymically in normal AKR mice, are present in the repertoire of young (less than 6-wk-old) AKR nu/nu mice. Isolation of a cloned CD4+V beta 6+ cell line with Mls-1a reactivity from young AKR nu/nu mice indicates that the correlation between TCR usage and specificity is consistent with that described in euthymic mice and that this population contains autoreactive T cells that are not anergic. By 6 mo of age, however, cells expressing V beta 6 are no longer detectable. Inability to detect these cells is not simply caused by failure to expand these cells in culture, because freshly isolated populations from old nude mice exhibit the same selective absence of V beta 6-bearing cells. The data strongly suggest that extrathymic deletion, rather than clonal anergy, accounts for the apparent absence of autoreactive V beta 6-bearing cells in aged AKR nu/nu mice.\r"

  ".U": "91268534\r", 
  ".W": "An important event in the migration of lymphocytes out of the blood is their adherence to endothelial cells (EC). In inflammatory sites cytokines activate EC and promote lymphocyte EC adherence and migration. Small peritoneal exudate lymphocytes (sPEL) preferentially migrate from the blood to cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and to sites injected with IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha/beta, and TNF-alpha, rather than to peripheral lymph nodes. The basis of this migration is sPEL adherence to cytokine-activated EC. To study this adhesion mAb to rat sPEL were screened for inhibition of sPEL adherence to IFN-gamma-stimulated EC. One mAb, TA-2, inhibited IFN-gamma-stimulated adherence to EC by 60%. This antibody had no effect on the baseline adherence of sPEL to unstimulated EC. Treatment of sPEL, but not EC, with TA-2-inhibited adhesion. TA-2 also inhibited adhesion to EC activated with mIL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS, and the adhesion of spleen T cells to activated EC. The TA-2 Ag was expressed on virtually all lymph node, spleen, and sPEL lymphocytes but sPEL expressed two to three times higher levels than lymph node lymphocytes, and the highest levels were found on CD4+ and CD45R- memory T cells. TA-2 immunoprecipitated a group of four polypeptides with molecular mass of 150, 130, 83, and 66 kDa. Finally, TA-2 inhibited sPEL adhesion to TNF-alpha and IL-1 stimulated human umbilical vein EC to the same extent as an anti-human VCAM-1 mAb, and combinations of TA-2 and anti-VCAM-1 were not different from treatment with either antibody alone. Thus, TA-2 appears to recognize rat VLA-4 based on immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and lymphocyte EC studies. VLA-4 mediates the adhesion of rat lymphocytes to rat microvascular EC stimulated with IFN-gamma, mIL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS. VLA-4 is important in the increased adhesion of sPEL to EC and the enhanced sPEL migration to inflammation may in part be explained by increased expression of VLA-4 on these cells.\r"

  ".U": "91268540\r", 
  ".W": "Lymphocyte proliferation in Con A- or LPS-stimulated murine splenic cell (SC) cultures was suppressed by the addition of excess macrophages. In Con A-stimulated cultures, suppression was associated with the expression of nitric oxide-synthesizing pathway (NOSP) activity as demonstrated by the accumulation of nitrite, a degradation product of nitric oxide (NO), in the culture supernatants. That NO, a cytotoxic and anti-proliferative metabolite of l-arginine, or other reactive nitrogen intermediates generated through the NOSP mediated the suppressive effect was suggested by the reversal of suppression brought about by the addition of a specific inhibitor of the NOSP (NG-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate) to the culture media. No NOSP activity was detectable in LPS-stimulated SC/macrophage cocultures. The role of T cell-derived IFN-gamma in the induction of the NOSP was investigated by the use of anti-IFN-gamma-mAb. Antibody-treated Con A supernatants failed to induce the NOSP in macrophages, and the addition of the mAb to Con A-stimulated SC/macrophage cocultures obviated the suppressive effects. Indomethacin and catalase only partially restored proliferation in Con A-stimulated SC/macrophage cocultures but were remarkably efficient in preventing macrophage-dependent suppression when LPS was used as the mitogenic stimulus. These results demonstrate a regulatory system of potential relevance in sites of predominant macrophage infiltration by which T cell-derived IFN-gamma activates the production of the mediator, NO, that suppresses T cell proliferation. In addition, these data demonstrate that, although the suppressive effects of excess macrophages appear to be expressed nonspecifically toward both T and B cells, suppression is mediated through a different mechanism in each case.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously characterized more than 20 proteins induced by the immunoregulatory lymphokine IFN-gamma in human fibroblasts by their m.w. and isoelectric points determined in two-dimensional gels. Some of these proteins are induced uniquely by IFN-gamma, whereas others are also induced by IFN-alpha, TNF, or IL-1. Recent technologic advances have allowed us to begin to rapidly identify proteins induced by IFN-gamma and other cytokines by sequencing the induced proteins from blots of preparative two-dimensional gels of total cell lysates. In this study, we show that the approximately 21 kDa, isoelectric point greater than 7 protein induced by IFN-gamma is manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), a mitochondrial protective enzyme encoded by a nuclear gene. Mn-SOD is induced by IFN-gamma and also by TNF in all four human cell lines examined: HS153 fibroblasts, ACHN renal carcinoma, A549 lung carcinoma, and A375 melanoma. Induction of Mn-SOD mRNA is a primary, rapid, and dose-dependent response to IFN-gamma. In ACHN renal carcinoma cells, Mn-SOD mRNA and protein are induced synergistically by IFN-gamma in combination with either TNF or IL-1, and the induced protein is enzymatically active. IFN-gamma and TNF together induce Mn-SOD mRNA by more than 100-fold relative to its level in untreated ACHN cells. The induction of Mn-SOD by IFN-gamma and its synergistic induction by IFN-gamma in combination with TNF and IL-1 should protect healthy cells from the toxicity of O2- during an immune response, and may provide a mechanism for selective killing of infected cells.\r"

To determine the mechanism of this suppression, the immunoregulatory activity of culture supernatants obtained from peripheral blood CD4+ Leu-8+ T cells cultured with anti-CD3 mAb and PMA (Leu-8+ supernatant) was determined. Leu-8+ supernatant suppressed PWM-stimulated Ig synthesis in cultures containing non-T cells and CD4+ Leu-8- T cells. In contrast, the supernatant from CD4+ Leu-8- T cells did not suppress Ig synthesis. The inhibitory activity of CD4+ Leu-8+ T cell supernatants could not be accounted for by a deficiency or excess of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-6, or PGE2. In studies examining the effect of CD4+ Leu-8+ supernatant on T cells, the supernatant did not alter either mitogen-induced proliferation or the helper function of CD4+ Leu-8- T cells. In studies examining the effect of CD4+ Leu-8+ supernatant on B cells, the supernatant inhibited Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain-induced B cell Ig secretion but not B cell proliferation. The suppressor activity of Leu-8+ supernatant was eliminated by protease treatment and was eluted by HPLC in two main peaks, with molecular sizes of 44 and 12 kDa. In summary, these studies indicate that supernatants from activated CD4+ Leu-8+ T cells directly suppress B cell Ig production.\r"

  ".W": "The nucleated cell death mediated by C5b-9 depends on the extent of C fixation and parameters that affect the ability of the cell to eliminate C5b-9. When C5b-9 formation exceeds elimination, cell death can be initiated. High Ca2+ in the medium accelerates Ehrlich ascites cell death induced by a large number of C5b-9, whereas osmotic prevention of cell swelling has little effect in protecting Ehrlich cells from killing by C5b-9. In the present study, we investigated the interrelationship between intracellular Ca2+, intra- and extracellular adenine nucleotides, and mitochondrial membrane potential, to understand the mechanism of acute cell death induced by C5b-9. When Ehrlich cells carrying C5b-8 were exposed to C9, rapid and profound ATP depletion in the cell was observed before cell death. Leakage of the adenine nucleotides ATP, ADP, and AMP also began during the prelytic phase. Studies using digital imaging fluorescence microscopy showed that loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was noted immediately after C9 addition but before nuclear staining with propidium iodide. These findings suggest that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ through C5b-9 channels and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential may initiate rapid cell death. The prelytic leakage of ATP precursors may also contribute to cell death by decreasing nucleotide pools, because recovery of ATP production was observed after a similar degree of ATP loss in cells exposed to sublethal doses of KCN, in which ADP and AMP leakage was not present.\r"

In these studies arachidonic acid and other cis-unsaturated fatty acids (but not trans-unsaturated or saturated fatty acids) increased the specific binding of the nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, [35S]GTP gamma S, to purified neutrophil membrane preparations and elicited superoxide anion generation from intact neutrophils. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.70) between the capacity of fatty acids to increase nucleotide binding and to elicit the respiratory burst. Scatchard plot analysis of binding at equilibrium demonstrated an increase in the number of available GTP binding sites in the presence of 50 microM arachidonic acid. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents interfered with the arachidonic acid effect on [35S]GTP gamma S binding. ADP-ribosylation of the pertussis toxin substrate Gi alpha within the plasmalemma-reduced specific [35S]GTP gamma S binding and blocked arachidonate-dependent enhancement of binding. Moreover, pertussis toxin treatment of intact neutrophils inhibited arachidonic acid-induced superoxide anion generation. The data indicate that arachidonic acid directly activates a GTP binding protein in the neutrophil plasma membrane and may thereby act as a second messenger in signal transduction.\r"

If the phosphatase activity of CD45 was processing spatial information coming from occupied receptors and leading to the directional cell response, sequestering CD45 in one region of the cell surface should lead to a decreased ability of the cells to orient in a gradient of chemoattractant. CD45 was capped by sequential addition of KC56, a mAb against CD45, and a rabbit anti-mouse antiserum. Cells with capped CD45 were able to orient toward N-formylnorleucylleucylphenylalanine and C5a at levels similar to those achieved by cells processed simultaneously but without capping CD45. This indicates that the spatial arrangement of CD45 is not critical for the ability of cells to orient in a gradient of chemoattractant.\r"

Sera were obtained from 33 VL patients, eight patients with subclinical VL, and from 27 normal volunteers. Only sera from VL patients markedly reduced Con A-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses, as well as IL-2 or IFN-gamma production by normal lymphocytes. Addition of exogenous human rIL-2 to cultures containing VL patient sera partially reversed the normal lymphocyte proliferative capacity and restored IFN-gamma production. This phenomenon was consistent with the presence of greatly elevated levels of soluble IL-2R (sIL-2R) in VL patients' sera (4299 +/- 2351 U/ml), well above those of normal sera (180 +/- 94 U/ml), or of sera from patients with subclinical leishmania infection without immunosuppression (1002 +/- 281 U/ml). Furthermore, the removal of sIL-2R reduced VL serum suppressive activity as evaluated by effects on IL-2 and on IFN-gamma production. These data suggest the participation of high levels of sIL-2R in the serum-mediated suppression in VL.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the specificity of naturally acquired IgM bactericidal for strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae that varied in sensitivity to the lytic action of normal human serum (NHS) and the relative ability of these strains to deplete the classical (CP) and alternative (ACP) C pathways. Lysis of both highly sensitive and relatively insensitive strains was inhibited by the same gonococcal lipooligosaccharides (LOS), as well as by Salmonella minnesota Re LOS and three hexosamine-containing glycose polymers. A polymer of N-acetylgalactosamine phosphate was the most inhibitory; a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine phosphate only partially inhibited. Neither 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (dOc1A) nor a polymer that contained dOc1A but not hexosamine inhibited NHS lysis. A co-polymer of N-acetylgalactosamine-dOc1A inhibited both bactericidal activity and the binding of IgM to the LOS of a highly serum-sensitive (sers) gonococcal strain. Carboxyl reduction of the dOc1A in this polymer did not affect its inhibitory capacity for gonococcal antibody, but abolished its binding to homologous antibody induced by vaccination. CP activity was not affected by vaccination. CP activity was not affected by absorption of NHS with gonococcal strains, whereas ablation of CP activity markedly but variously diminished lytic activity for highly sers strains. ACP activity was variously depleted by gonococcal strains, and the proportion of bacteria that could be lysed through the ACP varied among strains and among different populations of a given strain. The titer at which a strain was sensitive to NHS lysis was a function of its ACP consumption (p = 0.006), which accounted for 70% of the differences in titer among strains. Analyses of the absorbed sera revealed that the gonococci had variously depleted properdin from NHS as assessed by using an Ag-capture solid-phase RIA. Addition of purified properdin to absorbed sera restored ACP activity to normal levels. Western immunoblots of gonococcal lysates showed that purified properdin bound directly to a 39-kDa outer membrane protein. We conclude that both CP activation by IgM binding to LOS epitopes, one of which contains hexosamine, and ACP activation, which is a function of strain-specific direct binding of properdin, can initiate lysis of sers strains and that ACP activation, also enhances lysis and accounts for variations in sensitivity of sers strains.\r"

  ".W": "The differential induction of cytokines associated with Th1 and Th2 subsets has recently been described during Trichinella spiralis infection. Increased levels of resistance appear to correlate with elevated levels of the Th1-associated cytokines, IFN-gamma and IL-2. In the present report, a filter immunoplaque assay is used to quantify the actual numbers of cells that secrete IFN-gamma and IL-5. It is demonstrated that, in T. spiralis-infected B10.Q mice, Th1- and Th2-associated responses are compartmentalized to different lymphoid organs. Thus, Ag-induced IFN-gamma-producing cells predominate in the spleen, whereas IL-5-producing cells prevail in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). A corresponding compartmentalization of Ag-specific IgA and IgG1 antibody-secreting cells to the MLN is also noted. The virtual absence of Th1-associated responses in the MLN appears to be an Ag-associated phenomenon. MLN from either naive or T. spiralis-infected mice do have the capacity to secrete IFN-gamma if stimulated with Con A. The striking compartmentalization of Ag-driven cytokine responses seen in this parasite system may facilitate study of the mechanisms that regulate the induction of Th1 and Th2 subsets.\r"

  ".W": "These studies assess the roles of subpopulations of T lymphocytes in resistance to Schistosoma mansoni. CDF rats were depleted of the T cell subpopulation bearing the high affinity IL-2R by in vivo treatment with ART18+ mAb or of soluble IL-4 by treatment with 11B11 mAb. The development of parasites, the expression of resistance after sensitization, and the intensity of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), Ag-mediated blast transformation (AMBT), IgG2a, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, and IgE-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity responses against S. mansoni or control Ag were ascertained. Isolated T cell subpopulations were assessed in vivo and in vitro for effects upon the protective Ir. Depletion with ART18 mAb suppressed the development of W3/25+ helper-inducer cells and resulted in the initial survival of more worms, decreased resistance to challenge after initial sensitization, decreased IgG2a and IgE antibody, AMBT, and DTH reactivity against schistosome Ag. Depletion with ART18 did not prevent the development of OX8+ (T suppressor) cells. Depletion with 11B11 mAb led to insignificant changes in initial parasite survival and resistance to challenge; had no effect on IgG2a antibody, AMBT, or DTH; but profoundly suppressed the IgE responses against the parasite. Protective immunity to S. mansoni in rats is dependent upon IL-2R-bearing T lymphocytes and regulated by OX8+ cells but not absolutely contingent upon IL-4 or the IgE response.\r"

A remarkable similarity of VH gene sequences with previously sequenced antinucleic acid autoantibodies (Eilat, D., D. M. Webster and A. R. Rees. J. Immunol. 141:1745, 1988) was noted. This finding indicates that a small number of unique VH genes is involved in this autoimmune response and that the sequences of these genes are correlated with the different specificities for the autoantigen. The VK sequences appeared, by computer search, to be selected nonrandomly, but their use was not restricted to autoantibodies. An additional striking feature was evident in the construction of the D region elements, giving rise to CDR3 peptides that can interact with DNA and RNA. These constructs probably include D-D fusion products, which are relatively rare in Ig rearrangements.\r"

  ".W": "E710.2 is a cloned T cell line that was isolated from an AKR/J thymic tumor. This clone expresses Thy-1, heat-stable Ag, and the CD3/TCR complex but does not express CD4 or CD8. When the E710.2 cell line is injected into syngeneic mice, it grows as a malignant tumor in lymphoid organs and the thymus. In contrast, this cell line does not grow in vitro under standard culture conditions. This latter property allowed us to analyze the in vitro responsiveness of this CD4-CD8- cell line to stimulation by pharmacologic agents and cellular elements from the spleen and thymus. E710.2 cells proliferate when stimulated with phorbol esters or when cocultured with thymocytes or splenocytes. We could not detect soluble stimulatory factors in cultures of E710.2 and/or lymphoid cells, suggesting that cell contact might be required for this response. The stimulatory activity in thymus and spleen appears to be broadly expressed, because all cell subsets that were examined from these tissues stimulate this cell line. The stimulation of E710.2 cells is not MHC-restricted and is not inhibited by anti-MHC mAb. Furthermore, the responsiveness of these cells is not decreased when the TCR/CD3 complex is modulated from the cell surface. Similarly, TCR/CD3-deficient E710.2 variant clones retain their responsiveness to thymic and splenic cell stimulation. These findings suggest that there is a TCR-independent pathway of activation in E710.2 that is stimulated by a broadly expressed, non-MHC-encoded molecules(s).\r"

  ".W": "IL-4 is known to inhibit the growth and differentiation of 14-day-old fetal mouse thymus in organ culture. Here we report that IFN-gamma reverses this IL-4-mediated growth inhibition. Thymus lobes from 14-day-old fetuses were cultured for 12 days in medium containing 100 IU/ml rIL-4 either in the absence or presence of rIFN-gamma (100 to 1000 IU/ml). After culture, the cell yields and the absolute numbers and frequencies of the major subpopulations according the coordinate expression of CD4 and CD8 were estimated. IL-4 treatment alone was found to result in a seven-fold decrease in cell yield and an almost complete absence of the CD4+CD8+ subpopulation. Addition of IFN-gamma reversed IL-4-mediated inhibition in a dose-dependent fashion, with an optimal dose ranging from 200 to 500 IU/ml. IFN-gamma exerted this effect only when added within the first 48 h of initiating the culture. The specificity of the reversal effect was ascertained by neutralization of the effect by a neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma mAb and by lack of activity of human IFN-gamma. In the absence of IL-4, IFN-gamma had a growth-promoting effect as evident from a threefold increase in cell numbers.\r"

Using sheep E derivatized with CD3 antibodies, we show that metabolic inhibition of SRBC by depleting intracellular ATP with iodoacetamide, or even conversion of SRBC to \"ghosts\" by hypotonic lysis and resealing, has no effect on cytolysis. In the presence of EGTA or cholera toxin, both of which inhibit CTL degranulation, there is a strong suppression of both serine esterase release and cytolysis. These data show clearly that in some situations CTL are able to lyse target cells without any active participation by the target cells themselves.\r"

Here we demonstrate that the signal provided by CD4+ T cells can be replaced by anti-CD40 mAb. Highly purified surface (sIgM+) human B cells cultured with soluble anti-CD40 mAb in the presence of IL-4 produced IgM, total IgG, IgG4, and relatively high levels of IgE, indicating that production of these isotypes represented H chain switching and was not the result of a selective outgrowth of isotype committed B cells. No IgA was produced in these cultures. However, the T cell signal was different from the signal provided by anti-CD40 mAb, because in contrast to CD4+ T cells, anti-CD40 mAb failed to induce germ-line epsilon transcripts. However, anti-CD40 mAb strongly enhanced germ-line epsilon mRNA expression induced by IL-4. In addition, IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, and anti-CD23 mAb, which block IL-4-induced IgE production by PBMC, or B cells cocultured with CD4+ T cell clones, failed to inhibit IgG4 and IgE synthesis induced by anti-CD40 mAb. Finally, anti-CD40 mAb and CD4+ T cell clones had strong synergistic effects on IgG4 and IgE synthesis. These results indicate that different B cell activation pathways can result in IgG4 and IgE switching in the presence of IL-4.\r"

The addition of free carnitine doubled the rate of palmitoyl-CoA utilization in both heart and liver, but palmitoyl-CoA oxidation was always much lower than that of palmitoyl-carnitine. In livers of piglets from sows fed 8% fat, palmitoyl-carnitine oxidation was slower (P less than 0.03) than in piglets from sows fed 0% fat. Heart tissue metabolized isovalerate faster (P less than 0.02) when piglets were from sows fed fat compared with those from the nonfat group. A lysine x fat interaction was observed for piglet liver metabolism of isovalerate and acetoacetate, suggesting that a more metabolically developed pig results when sows are fed 0.48% lysine without supplemental fat during gestation. Carnitine did not seem to be the limiting factor for the oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA, and gestational dietary fat and lysine seemed to influence substrate metabolism in the newborn pig.\r"

The feeding of PCB resulted in more cholesterol in all fractions of serum lipoproteins tested, especially HDL (HDL1 and HDL2). Dietary supplementation of methionine primarily increased HDL cholesterol. The elevation of serum lipoprotein cholesterol due to PCB and/or methionine was significant in HDL1, which showed alpha-mobility. These results showed that methionine and PCB significantly influenced HDL metabolism. The secretion rate of VLDL was higher in rats fed PCB than in controls, but the addition of methionine to diets did not affect the secretion rate of VLDL cholesterol.

The titer of antibody to the p24 core protein and the concentration of serum neopterin were measured in 238 HIV-1-seropositive subjects in a prospective cohort study of homosexual men. Antibody titers were extremely variable among cohort participants but relatively stable over time, suggesting inherent differences in the initial immune response capacity. Neopterin concentrations were also variable at cohort entry but generally increased over time. These two markers, measured at cohort entry, had powerful and independent predictive value for the development of AIDS up to 54 months before diagnosis. Subjects with low antibody titers and high levels of neopterin, had the highest incidence of AIDS (60% over 54 months). Patients with low antibody or high neopterin alone had an intermediate risk (34% incidence) and less than 10% of those with high antibody and low neopterin developed AIDS. We propose that the initial immune response to HIV and virus-mediated immune system activation are independent and innately variable components of an individual's response to HIV infection that interact to determine the clinical outcome.\r"

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), long-chain triglycerides (LCT), chemically defined triglycerides (CDT; structured lipid with a high purity of 94.3%), and a mixture of MCT and LCT (MIX) were prepared as the lipid emulsions. TPN provided 350 kcal/kg/day, with a nonprotein calorie/nitrogen ratio of 160. The TPN-1 group received 10% nonprotein calories and the TPN-2 group received 30% nonprotein calories. MCT TPN was found to have some disadvantages, especially with regard to nitrogen balance and plasma albumin levels. Total cholesterol and phospholipids tended to be high in the MCT TPN group. The hepatic lipid content was higher in the lipid-free TPN and the MCT TPN groups, and lower in the CDT and LCT TPN groups. Histologically, the livers of the MIX, CDT, and LCT TPN groups showed less fatty change than those of the FREE and MCT groups.\r"

  ".W": "The physiologic response to stress can create a net loss of nitrogen, which is indicative of a catabolic state. Nitrogen balance has been demonstrated to be a useful clinical indicator of a patient's catabolic state and the effectiveness of parenteral nutrition, but requires an estimate of total urinary nitrogen excretion. The standard method for determining total urinary nitrogen excretion is 24-hour urinary urea nitrogen excretion. Unfortunately, the 24-hour urine collection is inconvenient, cumbersome, sometimes inaccurate, and induces a lag in response time to changes in therapy. Although shorter collection times have been proposed, the validity of shorter-timed determinations remains open to question. To evaluate the estimation of 24-hour urine urea excretion from shorter-timed determinations, the urinary urea nitrogen excretion of 4-, 8-, and 12-hour durations was regressed against the 24-hour collection in 56 critically ill adult patients. The 12-hour determination provided satisfactory estimates of the 24-hour nitrogen excretion, but the 4-hour and 8-hour determinations did not. Thus, two times the 12-hour urine urea nitrogen determination can be substituted for the 24-hour determination in calculating nitrogen balance. A 12-hour determination can provide a more rapid turnaround of biochemical analysis, allow more timely nutritional intervention, decrease nursing time, and reduce the frequency of inaccurate or lost specimens.\r"

Two groups (n = 8) of pigs were prefed for 8 days either an omega 3 FA or an omega 6 FA diet (Weaner Pig Feed with either menhaden or corn oil to produce a eucaloric feed with 15% fat) and then injected with live Escherichia coli. The omega 3 FA diet increased the concentration of eicosapentainoic acid (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) in plasma lipids, and increased the ratio of EPA to arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 omega 6) in platelets from 1:20 to 1:1 over the 8 days. Following the injection of bacteria, there was a fall in PaO2 and blood pressure that was attenuated (p less than 0.05) by the omega 3 FA diet. The omega 3 FA diet, compared to the omega 6 FA diet, also attenuated the rise in thromboxane B2 (3.0 +/- 1.1 vs 12.9 +/- 5.7 ng/mL) and 6 keto-PGF1 alpha (0.8 +/- 0.5 vs 1.7 +/- 1.1 ng/mL) associated with bacteremia. We conclude that dietary omega 3 FA attenuated the physiologic response to sepsis, possibly by modifying arachidonic acid metabolism.\r"

Thirteen male patients who underwent operation for esophageal cancer (group E), and 11 men (who underwent gastric or colorectal surgeries (group GC) were studied. The measurement of whole-body protein turnover, synthesis, and breakdown were made preoperatively on the 3rd and 10th postoperative day with constant infusion of [15N]glycine during isocaloric and isonitrogenous total parenteral nutrition. Significant increases in the rates of whole-body protein turnover (flux) and breakdown were seen in group E on the 3rd postoperative day (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively), whereas the increases were not significant in group GC. The rates of whole-body protein flux and breakdown were significantly greater in group E than group GC (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). The rate of protein synthesis significantly increased in group E (p less than 0.05), but did not alter or slightly decreased in group GC. The rates of whole-body protein flux and breakdown in group E were still significantly greater on the 10th postoperative day than preoperatively. It was concluded that unchanged or slightly decreased rates of whole-body protein synthesis with slightly increased breakdown were seen in the group of patients who underwent gastric or colorectal surgery, whereas synthesis increased significantly with a greater increase of breakdown in patients receiving severe surgical procedures, esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.\r"

A colonized catheter was defined as a catheter with a positive semiquantitative culture of the catheter tip (greater than or equal to 15 colonies on the plate). Catheter-related sepsis (CRS) was defined as a catheter with either the same organisms cultured from the catheter tip and from blood or with defervescence following catheter removal. Two hundred sixty-nine catheters were inserted for TPN for a total of 4433 patient days, with a mean length of stay of 16.5 days. Forty-two of the 269 catheters (15.6%) were colonized and more than half (57.1%) of the organisms cultured were Gram-negative bacilli or enterococci. Nineteen of the 42 colonized catheters were associated with CRS with a CRS rate of 7.1% among the 269 catheters. A DSF was present in 165 of the 244 patients or in 188 of the 269 catheters (69.9%). The colonization rate of 19.1% (36/188) in those catheters with DSF was significantly higher than that of 7.4% (6/81) in those without DSF (p less than 0.05). Those patients with DSF or with a colonized catheter were associated with a high mortality (p less than 0.001). Sepsis was responsible for 33 of the 48 patients (68.8%) who died. The data stress the important contribution of DSF to the colonization of TPN catheters and to the mortality of these critically ill surgical patients.\r"

Four-day-old piglets were infused for 7 days with a TPN solution that provided either 4.2 mmol Ca and 2.1 mmol P/kg/24 h as CaGluc and KPhos (the maximum quantities that can be provided using these sources), or 15.0 mmol Ca and 15.0 mmol P/kg/24 h as CaGP. Ca and P retentions were more than six times greater (p less than 0.01) in the piglets receiving CaGP (14.5 +/- 0.2 vs 2.2 +/- 0.3 mmol Ca/kg/24 h and 13.3 +/- 0.4 vs 2.4 +/- 0.1 mmol P/kg/24 h) (Mean +/- SEM). The ratio of Ca to fat-free dry weight, an indicator of bone mineralization, was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in the humerus (174.8 +/- 2.2 vs 147.2 +/- 6.7) and femur (158.3 +/- 4.8 vs 130.1 +/- 7.8) in the CaGP group. This study showed that CaGP is efficiently used as a source of Ca and P in TPN solutions for piglets. The results suggest that the use of CaGP as the source of Ca and P in TPN solutions may prevent the development of the undermineralized bone seen in low-birth weight infants nourished intravenously.\r"

A 41-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of hyperglycemia and dysuria. She had stopped insulin self-injection therapy for 2 years and diarrhea had become worse, resulting in malnutrition. Following enteral alimentation by elemental diet (ED) with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), frequency of diarrhea remarkably decreased and general nutritional condition was improved. At the first step, the patient was given 600 kcal/d ED through the tube sustained in the jejunum. Total calorie intake for 24 hours was gradually increased to the level of 2400 kcal/d and this therapy continued for 5 months. During this period, blood glucose level was kept in almost normal range (between 100 and 200 mg/dL) through the continuous insulin infusion of regular insulin (1.0-1.5 U/h). Thereafter, general conditions were improved and frequency of diarrhea gradually decreased. When this treatment was stopped, watery diarrhea, steatorrhea, and hypoalbuminemia completely disappeared and she gained 12 kg of body weight. Furthermore, spontaneous urination appeared following this treatment. This case suggests that the enteral hyperalimentation combined with strict control of blood glucose, using the CSII, may be an effective therapy for such severe diarrhea with malnutrition in diabetes.\r"

These patients as a result of treatment with chemotherapy and immunosuppressive agents undergo catabolic stress. The metabolic effect of an increased nitrogen dose during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was studied in 28 BMT patients. Patients were given TPN formulas providing a nitrogen intake of either 267 +/- 44 mg of N/kg/d or 330 +/- 60 mg of N/kg/d. Total calories, nonprotein and protein, were held constant at 40 kcal/kg/d for all patients. Data was collected for three periods posttransplant beginning at 3 days posttransplant through day 16. Both study TPN formulas improved patient weight and TIBC values over baseline. Nitrogen balance (NB) values were not significantly different at any study period. However, an overall group effect favored the H-N formula (p less than 0.01). BMT patients undergo catabolic stress which was reflected by average values of 24-hour urine urea nitrogen increasing from 8.1 +/- 4 g/d at baseline to 19.8 +/- 7.2 g/d at period 3 (p less than 0.01). The H-N formula did not differentially increase blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine levels. Metabolic cart measures also showed no increase in metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, or percent contribution of protein to total metabolic expenditure. Providing a caloric intake of 40 kcal/kg/d was excessive, where 30 to 35 kcal/kg/d would meet metabolic demands. Pertinent clinical outcomes including length of stay, relapse rate, and survival were monitored, but no conclusions could be drawn in this study. The H-N formula was more effective in reducing loss of lean body mass without causing detrimental metabolic effects in BMT patients.\r"

The values of KBD for CO2 suggested a mean EPBF of 1.9 +/- 0.1 (SEM) ml/min for isosmotic exchanges and 2.7 +/- 0.2 ml/min for hyperosmotic ones with a mean maximum nUFR of 0.43 +/- 0.01 ml/min. Cp of CO2 measured after the first five minutes of dwell underestimated EPBF. In normally hydrated rats, maximum nUFR was achieved when the peritoneal filtration fraction was 32 +/- 2%. This value is similar to the glomerular filtration fraction in rats of 30%. Thus, our results indicate the following relationships: EPBF = (approximately 3 x maximum nUFR)/(1 - hematocrit). EPBF was about six times greater than maximum nUFR and exceeded about 57 times nUFR obtained under isosmotic conditions. These differences between EPBF and nUFR suggest normal EPBF is not a major limiting factor for maximum ultrafiltration achieved during peritoneal dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. A recent randomized controlled trial of intravenous immune globulin in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the rate of bacterial infections among patients who received intravenous immune globulin. We used decision-analysis techniques to determine whether prophylactic intravenous immune globulin is likely to result in an overall clinical benefit to patients who receive this treatment and to examine its cost effectiveness. METHODS. We constructed a model to compare two strategies: treatment with intravenous immune globulin at a dose of 400 mg per kilogram of body weight every three weeks and no immune globulin therapy. Baseline estimates of the efficacy of intravenous immune globulin were derived from the published results of the randomized trial. The costs of treatment, complications, and infections were estimated on the basis of component costs. Health outcomes were measured in terms of gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy. RESULTS. Intravenous immune globulin therapy can result in a loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy when the inconvenience of treatment is taken into account. If the inconvenience of treatment is not considered, therapy results in a gain of 0.8 quality-adjusted days per patient per year of therapy at a cost of $6 million per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS. Decision-analysis modeling may be applied to the results of randomized controlled trials to assess the potential clinical and financial effects of adopting the intervention in medical practice. In the case of intravenous immune globulin therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, this type of analysis suggests that treatment might not result in improved quality or length of life and that it is extraordinarily expensive in comparison with other treatments generally accepted as cost effective.\r"

Although antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are known to be associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis, little is known about the pattern of HCV replication, its relation to antibody levels, and the clinical course of non-A, non-B hepatitis. METHODS. We measured HCV RNA in serial serum samples from five patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis who were followed for 10 to 14 years after transfusion. We also studied four chimpanzees that were experimentally infected with serum from four of these patients. Serum HCV RNA was detected by a \"nested\" polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay that used two sets of primers derived from the third (NS3) and fourth (NS4) non-structural gene regions of the HCV genome. RESULTS. HCV sequences were detected by PCR in only two of the five patients and two of the four chimpanzees with the set of primers corresponding to the NS3 region, but in all five patients (and in all four chimpanzees) with the primers from the NS4 region. Serum HCV RNA was first detected within three weeks of transfusion in all five patients and within one week in three patients. The viremia lasted less than 4 months in the patient (and two chimpanzees) with acute, self-limited hepatitis, whereas it persisted for 10 to 14 years in the four patients (and for 1 and 3 years in two chimpanzees) with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Antibodies to HCV were first detected at week 12 to 14; they disappeared after nine years in the patient with self-limited disease and became borderline after five years in one of the patients with chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS. During the early phase of primary HCV infection, there is a period of several months of sero-negativity during which HCV RNA is the only diagnostic marker of infection. The disappearance of HCV RNA from serum appears to correlate with the resolution of non-A, non-B hepatitis, whereas viremia persists in patients whose disease progresses to chronic hepatitis. In contrast, antibody levels do not necessarily remain elevated in patients with chronic disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Neutropenia and infection are major dose-limiting side effects of chemotherapy. Previous studies have suggested that recombinant methionyl granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can reduce chemotherapy-related neutropenia in patients with cancer. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test this hypothesis and the clinical implications. METHODS. Patients with small-cell lung cancer were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant methionyl G-CSF to study the incidence of infection as manifested by fever with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, less than 1.0 x 10(9) per liter, with a temperature greater than or equal to 38.2 degrees C) resulting from up to six cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or G-CSF, with treatment beginning on day 4 and continuing through day 17 of a 21-day cycle. RESULTS. The safety of the study treatment could be evaluated in 207 of the 211 patients assigned to either drug, and its efficacy in 199. At least one episode of fever with neutropenia occurred in 77 percent of the placebo group, as compared with 40 percent of the G-CSF group (P less than 0.001). Over all cycles of chemotherapy, the median duration of grade IV neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, less than 0.5 x 10(9) per liter) was six days with placebo as compared with one day with G-CSF. During cycles of blinded treatment, the number of days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, the number of days of hospitalization, and the incidence of confirmed infections were reduced by approximately 50 percent when G-CSF was given, as compared with placebo. Mild-to-moderate medullary bone pain occurred in 20 percent of the patients receiving G-CSF. CONCLUSIONS. The use of G-CSF as an adjunct to chemotherapy in patients with small-cell cancer of the lung was well tolerated and led to reductions in the incidence of fever with neutropenia and culture-confirmed infections; in the incidence, duration, and severity of grade IV neutropenia; and in the total number of days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics and days of hospitalization.\r"

  ".W": "Proteins often differ in amino-acid sequence across species. This difference has evolved by the accumulation of neutral mutations by random drift, the fixation of adaptive mutations by selection, or a mixture of the two. Here we propose a simple statistical test of the neutral protein evolution hypothesis based on a comparison of the number of amino-acid replacement substitutions to synonymous substitutions in the coding region of a locus. If the observed substitutions are neutral, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed differences between species should be the same as the ratio of replacement to synonymous polymorphisms within species. DNA sequence data on the Adh locus (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.1) in three species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup do not fit this expectation; instead, there are more fixed replacement differences between species than expected. We suggest that these excess replacement substitutions result from adaptive fixation of selectively advantageous mutations.\r"

  ".U": "91271233\r", 
  ".W": "A glnB gene is identified in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, and its gene product is found to be covalently modified as a result of imbalance in electron transfer in photosynthesis, where photosystem II is favored over photosystem I. The gene was cloned and sequenced and found to encode a polypeptide of 112 amino acid residues, whose sequence shows a high degree of similarity to the Escherichia coli regulatory protein, PII. In E. coli, PII is involved in signal transduction in transcriptional and post-translational regulation of nitrogen assimilation. Increase in ammonium ion concentration is shown to decrease covalent modification of the Synechococcus PII protein, as in enteric bacteria. We therefore propose that the photosynthetic electron transport chain may regulate the pathway of nitrogen assimilation in cyanobacteria by means of posttranslational, covalent modification of the glnB gene product. The existence of the glnB gene in different strains of cyanobacteria is demonstrated and its implications are discussed.\r"

The first cassette polF contains the full-length pol open reading frame; the second cassette pol100 starts with the first AUG codon of the pol gene and deletes 103 amino acids from the amino terminus of the pol gene product; the third cassette pol97 deletes the entire protease coding sequence; the fourth cassette pol66 deletes both the protease and endonuclease/integrase coding sequences; and the fifth cassette pol51 contains the reverse transcriptase coding sequences plus 39 3'-terminal nucleotides of the RNase H coding sequences. We have expressed these five forms of the pol gene in Spodoptera frugiperda SF9 cells and have analyzed for both reverse transcriptase and RNase H activities. The polF construct expressed several processed forms, 66 kDa, 51 kDa, and 34 kDa proteins, that were detected only by Western blot. In contrast, pol100, pol97, pol66, and pol51 products were expressed at high levels and were readily detectable in gels by staining. The levels of expression of these four products were estimated to be greater than 150 mg/liter of culture (5 x 10(8) cells). Activity gel analyses showed that the pol100, pol97, pol66, and pol51 products possess reverse transcriptase activity; however, only pol97 and pol66 have RNase H activity. Our results demonstrate that many forms, including partially cleaved forms of human immunodeficiency virus 1 pol gene products, possess reverse transcriptase activity but only certain forms have RNase H activity.\r"

Specifically, we have shown that in implants containing a beta-galactosidase gene linked to either an immediate early promoter of cytomegalovirus or a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene promoter, only the DHFR promoter allows long-term expression. We propose that choice of the promoter manifests significant influence on the long-term expression of genes introduced in fibroblast implants by retroviral vectors.\r"

Among 58 clinically well-defined chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) patients, 49 (84.5%) were positive for p22 antibody (anti-p22), whereas 42 (72.4%) were positive for C100-3 antibody (anti-C100-3), as measured by the present assay using the HCV nonstructural protein as antigen. Thirty-nine patients (67.2%) had both antibodies. No significant level of anti-p22 was detected in sera of chronic hepatitis B patients or normal blood donors. In typical post-transfusion NANBH patients, anti-p22 could be detected at, or even before, the first alanine aminotransferase peak. Anti-p22 was also detected in blood donors who were previously shown to be involved in transmitting HCV but in whose serum anti-C100-3 was not detectable. The ELISA detecting antibody to the HCV core protein expressed and properly processed in animal cells will be useful for mass screening of donor blood as well as for early diagnosis of hepatitis C.\r"

These receptors are preferentially expressed in postmitotic cells, transducing signals specified by their endogenous agonist, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Cells transfected with individual human mAChR genes were morphologically indistinguishable from parental NIH 3T3 cells in the absence of agonist. In contrast, when cultures were supplemented with carbachol, a stable analog of acetylcholine, foci of transformation readily appeared in m1, m3, or m5 but not in m2 or m4 mAChRs transfectants. Receptor expression was verified by ligand binding and was similar for each transfected culture. Transformation was dose-dependent and required only low levels of receptor expression. In transformation-competent cells, agonist induced phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, whereas in m2 or m4 transfectants, receptors were coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. These findings demonstrate that mAChRs linked to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis can act as conditional oncogenes when expressed in cells capable of proliferation.\r"

A monoclonal antibody to P. falciparum specific for the (NANP)n amino acid sequence bound to the engineered antibody, and a synthetic (NANP)3 peptide blocked this interaction. Immunization of rabbits and mice with the engineered antibody resulted in the elicitation of a humoral response to (NANP)3 synthetic peptide and P. falciparum parasite. In mice, in which immunity to the (NANP)n epitope is highly restricted by immune response genes, antibodies were induced in responder and nonresponder haplotypes of the major histocompatibility complex. Rabbit antibodies efficiently inhibited the in vitro invasion of cultured liver cells by P. falciparum parasite. Collectively, this study indicates that immunity to malaria in the absence of the parasite can be induced using antibody variable regions engineered to mimic the parasite's molecular structure. In general terms, the results suggest that antibody (idiotype) mimicry of an exogenous antigen is possible and may only require a discrete stretch of identity between the two molecules. The implication for the preparation of antibody-based vaccines and idiotype regulation of immunity are discussed.\r"

One protein (17 kDa) modulates the low-affinity Fc receptor for IgE on lymphocytes (i.e., CD23); it decreases the binding avidity of IgE to CD23-bearing B cells without affecting quantitative expression of CD23 and is thus designated epsilon-receptor-modulating protein. The second protein (30 kDa) suppresses IgE biosynthesis (i.e., SFA). This purified SFA suppresses interleukin 4-induced IgE and IgG1 synthesis by lipopolysaccharide-activated spleen cells but has no effect on other antibody isotypes; since the activity of SFA is not blocked by anti-interferon gamma monoclonal antibody, it is thus distinct from interferon gamma. The data presented indicate that epsilon-receptor-modulating protein and SFA are protein molecules that are involved in modulating the CD23 molecule and IgE antibody synthesis, respectively.\r"

  ".U": "91271269\r", 
  ".W": "This laboratory has previously demonstrated that there is an opiate receptor-mediated, concentration-dependent modulation of the electrically stimulated release of enkephalin from the guinea pig myenteric plexus. Low doses of opioids (nanomolar) enhance release, whereas higher concentrations (10-100 nM) inhibit release. We now demonstrate that the in vivo i.p. administration of the islet-activating protein from pertussis toxin (PTX; 50 micrograms/500 g of body weight) markedly diminishes the potency of mu, delta, or kappa-selective opioids to inhibit the evoked release of enkephalin. In contrast, PTX is without effect on the enhancement of enkephalin release observed after treatment with nanomolar concentrations of the above opioids. Conversely, pretreatment with cholera toxin (CTX; 0.01 nM for 3 hr in vitro) has no effect on the mu, delta, or kappa opioid inhibition of evoked enkephalin release but abolishes the ability of nanomolar concentrations of these agonists to enhance stimulated enkephalin release. These data indicate that different classes of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) appear to mediate the opioid enhancement or inhibition of stimulated enkephalin release. Furthermore, they suggest that a PTX-sensitive G protein (Gi or Go) and a CTX-sensitive G protein (Gs) are integral components of the mechanism that mediates opioid inhibition and opioid enhancement, respectively, of evoked enkephalin release. To our knowledge, this report represents the first demonstration that Gs-coupled opiate receptors (in addition to those that are coupled to Gi) can modulate transmitter release.\r"

The identification of these guanylate cyclases was confirmed using three chromatography systems with the purified enzymes. Specific binding to Con A-Sepharose suggested that rod guanylate cyclase is a glycoprotein. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of purified toad, frog, and bovine enzymes resolved two, three, and five variants, respectively, that differed in isoelectric point. Two variants of toad guanylate cyclase showed differences in various characterizations.

Here we report that Thr286 is the major CaM kinase autophosphorylation site occupied in situ in \"organotypic\" hippocampal cultures. Measurement of Ca(2+)-independent CaM kinase activity revealed that approximately one-third of the kinase is autophosphorylated in situ when the basal Ca2+ concentration is 15-43 nM. This proportion was substantially reduced 30 min after removal of extracellular Ca2+ or treatment of the cultures with protein kinase inhibitors and was increased by treatment with okadaic acid. Therefore, the high proportion of autophosphorylated kinase at basal Ca2+ concentrations appears to be maintained by Ca(2+)-dependent autophosphorylation. Homogenates of intact hippocampi also contain a high proportion of Ca(2+)-independent type II CaM kinase, 13-23% depending on developmental age. Thus, in hippocampal neurons, an important function of the autophosphorylation mechanism may be to produce a relatively high level of CaM kinase activity, even at basal Ca2+ concentrations, permitting both upward and downward local regulation by physiological agents.\r"

The bacterial multidrug efflux system transported similar drugs and was sensitive to similar inhibitors as the mammalian multidrug transporter, P-glycoprotein. The gene coding for the bacterial multidrug transporter, like the P-glycoprotein gene in mammalian MDR cells, was amplified in the resistant bacteria. On the other hand, the bacterial multidrug transporter showed no sequence similarity to P-glycoprotein but exhibited an obvious homology to tetracycline efflux pumps and carbohydrate-ion symporters. These results show that the transport of structurally unrelated molecules can be mediated by members of different families of membrane transporters.\r"

Application of solutions of topa to the chicken eyecup preparation results in glutamatergic responses mediated predominantly by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Pharmacological activity depends upon oxidation in solution to a new compound. This compound is tentatively identified as topa quinone. Solutions of topa are toxic to cortical neurons in culture, and this toxicity is blocked by the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. These results suggest that production or accumulation of topa or its oxidation products might be involved in excitotoxicity, especially in dopaminergic neurons and their projection targets.\r"

  ".U": "91271301\r", 
  ".W": "Somatic mutation in immunoglobulin genes is localized to a 2-kilobase region of DNA surrounding and including rearranged variable (V), diversity, and joining (J) gene segments encoding heavy and light chains. To examine the structural basis for targeted mutation, we developed an assay to score mutation on plasmid substrates by using a reporter gene: a bacterial gene encoding an amber-suppressor tRNA molecule was placed 3' of a rearranged kappa VJ gene within the boundaries of mutation. The reporter gene is exquisitely suited for mutational analysis because it is only 200 base pairs (bp), which should not greatly disrupt structure of the immunoglobulin locus, and gene function depends on secondary structure, which means mutation can be scored in many different nucleotide positions. The plasmid was used to make transgenic mice, which were then immunized. The shuttle vector was retrieved by plasmid rescue into an indicator strain of Escherichia coli that contained an amber mutation in its beta-galactosidase gene. Integrity of the tRNA molecule was monitored by colony color, which permitted many transformants to be screened visually. Mutations were not seen in DNA from a transfected B-cell line grown in vitro or in DNA from nonlymphoid tissue of transgenic mice, indicating that the reporter gene was stable during cell division and DNA manipulations. However, when the transgenic mice were immunized, DNA from splenic B cells contained point mutations in the reporter gene at a frequency of 10(-3) per transformant. Sequence analysis of 17 mutated transgenes revealed that the mutations were 1- and 2-bp deletions in the tRNA gene, and one plasmid had an additional 2-bp deletion in the V gene. In contrast, previous studies have shown that mutations in endogenous VJ genes are predominantly nucleotide substitutions and have only 6% deletions. Two other plasmid constructs were analyzed in transgenic lines: no mutations were found when the tRNA gene was placed distal to the VJ gene, and no mutations were seen when the immunoglobulin promoter was deleted. Although we lack direct evidence that the deletions in the tRNA gene are caused by the same mechanism that acts on VJ genes, we have shown that mutations in this assay occur in a manner consistent with immunoglobulin-specific mutation in that they are found in splenic B cells and not in tail tissue, depend on position next to the VJ gene, and require transcription of the VJ gene.\r"

Their transposition is usually difficult to study, particularly in humans, where some diseases have been shown to result from LINE insertion mutations. This is due to the fact that most copies of any particular family of elements are defective and that their transposition frequency is low. By contrast, the I factor of Drosophila melanogaster transposes at high frequency during I-R hybrid dysgenesis and is a good model for studying the LINE element superfamily. LINEs encode putative polypeptides showing similarities with viral reverse transcriptases but, unlike viral retrotransposons, they do not have terminal repeats and their ability to transpose by reverse transcription has previously only been inferred from structural analysis. Here we present direct evidence for LINE retrotransposition. Transposition of an I factor marked by an intron resulted in accurate removal of the intron.\r"

  ".W": "Promoters in Escherichia coli that are negatively regulated by the CytR repressor are also activated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complexed to cAMP; as a characteristic, these promoters encode tandem binding sites for cAMP-CRP. In one such promoter, deoP2, CytR binds to the region between the tandem CRP binding sites with a relatively low affinity; in the presence of cAMP-CRP, however, the repressor and activator bind cooperatively to the DNA. Here we have investigated this cooperativity by isolating mutants of the CRP protein that abolish CytR regulation without exhibiting a concomitant loss in their ability to activate transcription. Four different, single amino acid substitutions in CRP give rise to this phenotype. These amino acids lie in close proximity on the surface of the CRP tertiary structure in a portion of the protein that is not in contact with the DNA. In vitro analyses of one of the CRP mutants show that it interacts with the DNA in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type CRP, whereas its interaction with CytR is perturbed. These results strongly indicate that cooperative DNA binding of CytR and cAMP-CRP is achieved through protein-protein interactions.\r"

This protein is thought to be a motor for the movement of membranous organelles in cells. Recently Hollenbeck and Swanson [Hollenbeck, P. J. & Swanson, J. A. (1990) Nature (London) 346, 864-866] showed that kinesin is involved in the positioning of tubular lysosomes in macrophages. However, the role of this protein in the movement of organelles was not yet clear. We used a polyclonal antibody against the kinesin heavy chain that inhibited kinesin-dependent microtubule gliding in vitro to study the role of kinesin in the movement of pigment granules in melanophores of the teleost black tetra (Gymnocorymbus ternetzi). Microinjection of the antibody into cultured melanophores did not produce any specific effect on the aggregation of pigment granules in melanophores, but it did result in a strong dose-dependent inhibition of the dispersion. Immunoblotting of melanophore extracts showed that the kinesin antibody reacted in these cells with a single protein component with a molecular mass of 135 kDa. Thus, kinesin is responsible for the movement of pigment granules from the center to the periphery of the melanophore.\r"

One of the functions of protein-tyrosine phosphatases is to reverse the effect of protein-tyrosine kinases, many of which are oncogenes, suggesting that some protein-tyrosine phosphatase genes may act as tumor suppressor genes. A hallmark of tumor suppressor genes is that they are deleted in tumors in which their inactivation contributes to the malignant phenotype. In this study, one PTP gamma allele was lost in 3 of 5 renal carcinoma cell lines and 5 of 10 lung carcinoma tumor samples tested. Importantly, one PTP gamma allele was lost in three lung tumors that had not lost flanking loci. PTP gamma mRNA was expressed in kidney cell lines and lung cell lines but not expressed in several hematopoietic cell lines tested. Thus, the PTP gamma gene has characteristics that suggest it as a candidate tumor suppressor gene at 3p21.\r"

In the present study of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes in 25 non-Jewish PV patients, DR4, DQw8 was found in 12 of the patients and DRw6, DQw5 was found in 15. Only 3 patients had neither. Only 1 of the DR4, DQw8 haplotypes was [HLA-B38, SC21, DR4, DQw8] and 2 were HLA-B35, SC31, DR4, DQw8; most were the presumed fragments (SC31, DR4, DQw8) or (SC21, DR4, DQw8) or DR4, DQw8 with some other complotype. Of the patients with DRw6, DQw5, all were DRw14, DQw5, and 6 had a rare Caucasian haplotype, HLA-Bw55, SB45, DRw14, DQw5. Four of 6 of these were found in patients of Italian extraction, as was the 1 normal example. The non-Jewish patients were of more Southern European extraction than our controls. This suggests that there are two major MHC susceptibility alleles in American patients with PV. The more ancient apparently arose on a haplotype in the Jews, HLA-B38(35), SC21(SC31), DR4, DQw8, and spread to other populations largely as D-region segments. The other arose in or near Italy on the haplotype HLA-Bw55, SB45, DRw14, DQw5 and has also partially fragmented so that many patients carry only DRw14, DQw5. The available data do not permit the specific localization of either the DR4, DQw8- or the DRw14, DQw5-linked susceptibility genes.\r"

The larger RNA codes for a 338-amino acid protein, whereas the smaller RNA results from the removal of an additional 140 nucleotides from FosB mRNA by alternative splicing. This alternative splicing event places a stop codon following the \"leucine zipper\" region and results in a shorter protein (FosB2) of 237 amino acids that lacks 101 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. FosB2 is able to form heterodimers with c-Jun and bind to an AP-1 site but is not able to activate the transcription of promoters containing AP-1 sites. Furthermore, FosB2 can not only suppress the transcriptional activation by c-Fos and c-Jun of promoters containing an AP-1 site but also interferes with the transforming potential of viral and cellular Fos proteins. We propose that FosB2 protein functions as a trans-negative regulator.\r"

Generation of cell lines is facilitated by the introduction of immortalizing oncogenes into cell types of interest. One gene known to immortalize many different cell types in vitro encodes the simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor (T) antigen (TAg). To circumvent the need for gene insertion in vitro to generate cell lines, we created transgenic mice harboring the SV40 TAg gene. Since previous studies have shown that TAg expression in transgenic mice is associated with tumorigenesis and aberrant development, we utilized a thermolabile TAg [from a SV40 strain, tsA58, temperature sensitive (ts) for transformation] to reduce the levels of functional TAg present in vivo. To direct expression to a broad range of tissues, we used the mouse major histocompatibility complex H-2Kb promoter, which is both widely active and can be further induced by interferons. tsA58 TAg mRNA was expressed in tissues of all animals harboring the hybrid construct. Development of all tissues was macroscopically normal except for thymus, which consistently showed hyperplasia. Fibroblast and cytokeratin+ thymic epithelial cultures from these mice were readily established without undergoing crisis and were conditionally immortal in their growth; the degree of conditionality was correlated with the levels of tsA58 TAg detected. One strain of H-2Kb-tsA58 mice has been bred through several generations to homozygosity and transmits a functional copy of the transgene.\r"

The important target genes and, hence, the molecular mechanism of Fos function are, however, still unknown, partly due to the lack of a tightly regulated Fos-induction system. Here we show that different activities of the Fos protein can be controlled hormonally by fusing the mouse c-Fos protein to the ligand-binding domain of either the rat glucocorticoid or the human estrogen receptor. These fusion proteins stimulate AP1-dependent transcription and repress endogenous fos mRNA synthesis in a strictly hormone-dependent manner. Expression of these chimeric proteins in rat fibroblasts results in fast, reversible, and tightly controlled transformation in response to hormone. A Fos-estrogen receptor expressing cell line was used to isolate Fos-responsive genes by subtractive cDNA cloning. Run-on analysis of one of these genes showed that its transcription is rapidly and directly regulated by the hormone-activated Fos-estrogen receptor protein, demonstrating the potential of this induction system for identifying Fos target genes.\r"

  ".W": "Kinetic properties of the purified alpha, beta, and gamma subspecies of protein kinase C (PKC) to respond to diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), and Ca2+ were reinvestigated in the presence of several fatty acids. Although responses of these enzyme subspecies to the lipids slightly differed from one another, the reaction velocity of these subspecies was significantly enhanced by synergistic action of diacylglycerol and a cis-unsaturated fatty acid. Arachidonic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and docosahexaenoic acids were active in this role, whereas saturated fatty acids such as palmitic and stearic acids were inactive. Elaidic acid was also inactive. In the presence of both PtdSer and diacylglycerol, the cis-unsaturated fatty acids increased further an apparent affinity of PKC to Ca2+ and allowed the enzyme to exhibit almost full activation at nearly basal levels of Ca2+ concentration. The concentration of fatty acid giving rise to the maximum activation of enzyme was approximately 20-50 microM. The result presented herein implies that the receptor-mediated release of unsaturated fatty acids from phospholipids may take part, in synergy with diacylglycerol, in the activation of PKC even when the Ca2+ concentration is low. A possibility arises, then, that the activation of PKC is an integral part of the signal-induced degradation cascade of various membrane phospholipids, which is initiated by the actions of phospholipase C and phospholipase A2.\r"

The effect was concentration dependent with a half-maximal effect in the 100-200 pM range. Injection of alpha o* stimulated protein kinase C activity. Coinjection of the peptide containing residues 19-36 of protein kinase C [PKC-(19-36)], a specific protein kinase C inhibitor, blocked the alpha o*- but not progesterone-induced maturation. Cycloheximide and the injection of antisense oligonucleotides specific to the c-mos transcript blocked alpha o-induced maturation. Immunoprecipitation with a mos protein-specific monoclonal antibody showed that alpha o-injected oocytes had phosphorylated mos protein. When PKC-(19-36) was coinjected with alpha o*, phosphorylated mos protein was not observed. These observations indicate that alpha o*, through protein kinase C and the translation of c-mos, can trigger meiotic division of Xenopus oocytes. Our results raise the possibility that persistently activated G proteins through cellular protooncogenes may regulate cell-cycle resumption.\r"

All the mutations are located in the relatively conserved central region of the protein. A comparative analysis of the CIII protein sequence in lambda, HK022, and the lambdoid bacteriophage P22 leads us to suggest that this central region assumes an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. This part of the lambda cIII gene was cloned within a fragment of the lacZ gene (the alpha-complementing fragment). The resulting fusion protein displays CIII activity. Mutations that yield a nonfunctional fusion protein map within its CIII moiety.

  ".W": "We have determined a molecular defect to be the likely basis for inactivity of the tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) from a patient with tyrosinase-negative oculocutaneous albinism. A single base (thymine) was inserted in exon 5 of the tyrosinase gene following codon 471 in the putative transmembrane coding region. This insertion caused a shift in the reading frame of 19 amino acids at the 3' end and introduced a premature termination signal that would be expected to truncate the protein by 21 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. The albino tyrosinase was not recognized by antibodies directed to the carboxyl terminus of tyrosinase. Furthermore, as shown by gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated protein, the tyrosinase was approximately 3 kDa smaller than normal. Similar immunoprecipitation data were obtained when cloned normal and mutant tyrosinases were expressed in COS-1 cells.\r"

Functional activation of transcriptional factor c-Jun/AP-1 is believed to play an important role in signal transduction of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced tumor promotion. Suppression of the c-Jun/AP-1 activation by curcumin is observed in mouse fibroblast cells. In vitro experiments indicate that inhibition of c-Jun/AP-1 binding to its cognate motif by curcumin may be responsible for the inhibition of c-Jun/AP-1-mediated gene expression. These findings show that the effect of curcumin on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced inflammation/tumor promotion could be studied at the molecular level.\r"

The PSI RC was obtained in two forms, monomeric and trimeric. The two forms contained the same number of pigments per P700 and displayed similar photochemical activities. The two forms had nearly identical polypeptide subunit compositions; the only observed difference was an additional subunit of about 12 kDa observed in the trimeric form. The purified preparations of both the monomeric and the trimeric forms were used for crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis. The trimeric PSI RC preparations produced several three-dimensional crystal forms, one of which, the \"hexagonal needle\" form (THN), had a hexagonal unit cell with dimensions of 300 x 300 x 160 A, containing four PSI RC trimers. The monomeric preparations also produced single crystals of several forms under various crystallization conditions. One of these crystal forms, the \"hexagonal plate\" (MHP), diffracted to a resolution of about 5.5 A. It had a hexagonal unit cell with dimensions of 192 x 192 x 163 A, containing six PSI RC monomers. Comparison of the PSI RCs in the crystals with those in the precrystallization preparations demonstrated that neither the monomeric nor the trimeric form of PSI RC was altered by the crystallization process. Both forms retained their original polypeptide subunit composition and their pigment content.\r"

The involucrin gene of the tarsioids alone contains repeats at both sites, for it derived repeats at site P from a common ancestor of tarsioids and prosimians and a repeat at site M from a later common ancestor of tarsioids and anthropoids. After their divergence from the tarsioids, the anthropoids added many more repeats to site M and excised the older segment of repeats from site P; in contrast, the tarsioids stopped adding repeats at site M, retained the earlier segment of repeats at site P, and enlarged it. In the revision of their involucrin genes, the two lineages followed alternative routes. The mechanisms by which the revisions took place have been subject to abrupt onset or termination.\r"

  ".W": "Protooncogene c-fos is induced by activation of adenylate cyclase through the major cAMP-responsive element (CRE) centered at position -60 of the promoter. cAMP induction is followed by a rapid decrease in transcriptional rate, reminiscent of down-regulation after serum stimulation. Fos protein is known to negatively autoregulate serum-induced transcription of c-fos promoter, but whether Fos is responsible for down-regulation of cAMP-induced transcription is unclear. Here we show that Fos is unable to down-regulate CRE-mediated activation. We present evidence that the transcriptional antagonist CRE modulator (CREM) can bind to c-fos CRE and heterodimerize with activator CRE-binding protein, thereby blocking cAMP induction. Furthermore, expression of antisense CREM enhances c-fos basal and cAMP-induced transcription. CREM does not antagonize serum-induced transcription; therefore, we conclude that down-regulation of c-fos is exerted by different effectors, depending upon which signal transduction pathway is activated. We speculate that, by its c-fos down-regulatory function, CREM may act as an antioncogene.\r"

  ".U": "91271407\r", 
  ".W": "The human T-cell line Jurkat was found to contain at least two immunologically distinct isoforms of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC), PLC-beta 1 and PLC-gamma 1. Treatment of Jurkat cells with antibody to CD3 led to phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 but not of PLC-beta 1. The phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 occurred rapidly and transiently on both serine and tyrosine residues; tyrosine phosphorylation reached a maximum level less than 1 min after stimulation and decreased rapidly, both in the presence and in the absence of orthovanadate. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis revealed that the major sites of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation in PLC-gamma 1 from activated Jurkat cells are the same as those in PLC-gamma 1 from cells treated with peptide growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Previously, it has been shown that multiple phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 by the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases leads to activation of PLC-gamma 1. Thus, the current data suggest that inositol phospholipid hydrolysis triggered by the T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex is due, at least in part, to activation of PLC-gamma 1 and that the mechanism by which this activation is achieved involves phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues on PLC-gamma 1 by a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase coupled to the T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex.\r"

Using the electroantennogram (EAG), a measure of antennal physiology, we have found an adult antennal defect in the olfactory behavioral mutant abnormal chemosensory jump 6 (acj6). The acj6 EAG defect was mapped to a single locus and the same mutation was found to be responsible for both reduction in EAG amplitude and diminished behavioral response, as if reduced antennal responsiveness to odorant is responsible for abnormal chemosensory behavior in the mutant. acj6 larval olfactory behavior is also abnormal; the mutation seems to alter cellular processes necessary for olfaction at both developmental stages. The acj6 mutation exhibits specificity in that visual system function appears normal in larvae and adults. These experiments provide evidence that the acj6 gene encodes a product required for olfactory signal transduction.\r"

The authors present estimates of the economic costs from these causes for 1985 and 1988, based on current and reliable data available from national surveys and the use of new costing methodology. The total losses to the economy related to alcohol and drug abuse and mental illness for 1988 are estimated at $273.3 billion. The estimate includes $85.8 billion for alcohol abuse, $58.3 billion for drug abuse, and $129.3 billion for mental illness. The total estimated costs for 1985, $218.1 billion, include $51.4 billion for direct treatment and support costs; $80.8 billion for morbidity costs, the value of reduced or lost productivity; $35.8 billion for mortality costs, the value of foregone future productivity for the 140,593 premature deaths associated with these disorders, based on a 6 percent discount rate and including an imputed value for housekeeping services; and $47.5 billion in other related costs, including the costs of crime, motor vehicle crashes, fire destruction, and the value of productivity losses for victims of crime, incarceration, crime careers, and caregiver services. The cost of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome associated with drug abuse is estimated at $1 billion, and the cost of fetal alcohol syndrome is estimated at $1.6 billion. The estimates may be considered lower limits of the true costs to society of alcohol and drug abuse and mental illness in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence rate of drug use by pregnant women in the United States has been shown to range from 7.5 percent to 11 percent. Drug exposure in utero has been associated with deleterious effects on the fetus and newborn. Public health officials are currently confronted with difficult policy decisions with regard to testing and reporting of pregnant and post-partum women and the provision of appropriate services. The widespread lack of consistent policy on the State level has led to bias in testing and reporting procedures and to the inappropriate use of the legal system as a deterrent to drug use during pregnancy. A survey of the 50 States and the District of Columbia found that no State currently has enacted legislation regarding testing. Thirteen States have mandatory reporting policies for drug-exposed newborns. Eleven of these States require reporting to social service agencies, at least 3 States routinely report to criminal justice agencies, and 10 require that reports be filed as child abuse or neglect. Many States without mandatory reporting statutes indicate that reports are made to social service agencies at the discretion of the health care provider. During fiscal year 1990, only 22 States specifically allocated funds for programs that address perinatal substance use. In States with mandatory reporting policies, reports should be made only to social service agencies in conjunction with the provision of appropriate preventive, medical, and social services to the woman and her infant. Interagency coordination is necessary to standardize testing and reporting practices within States and to effectively allocate resources.\r"

  ".W": "Although most women infected with HIV are intravenous drug users, some contact the virus through sexual contact with IV drug users. To reach at-risk women, public health officials must develop a range of prevention strategies. One approach, skills training, holds promise as a means of altering risk-related sexual behavior. In this study, 91 women methadone patients were pretested and randomly assigned to an information-only control control group or a skills-building intervention group. Skills-building intervention consisted of five sessions of small groups in which participants identified their own high risk sexual behaviors, discussed their negative associations with condoms, and practiced skills which involved asking partners to use condoms. Compared with members of the control group, respondents in the intervention group reported that they initiated discussion of sexual issues with their partners more frequently, felt more comfortable talking with them about safer sex, and reported using and carrying condoms more frequently. The high rates of attendance and program retention by skills-building participants suggest that such groups may be supportive and useful in the design of risk reduction and drug abuse treatment programs. The modest outcomes of this study underscore the difficulty of altering risk behavior but also serve as a basis for future AIDS prevention studies.\r"

The context for collection of these data over a 9-month period in 1989 is described. Baseline demographic characteristics including distributions by ethnicity, sex, age, and length of stay in the United States, as well as family heart health history, hypertension level, and heart health awareness of these subjects are presented. For example, 85 percent of the immigrants did not know what could be done to prevent heart disease. Implications for the design of ethnically approved and scientifically valid prevention strategies are discussed. Based on these data, the authors realized that multiple health education strategies tailored to what they were learning about Southeast Asians would be needed. Through Southeast Asian leaders, they were led to using wall calendars, with words specific to each Southeast Asian language, that had a monthly heart health slogan as one avenue to reach Southeast Asians. Another strategy was to develop videotapes featuring cultural content but including heart health \"commercials.\" The authors concluded that, although scientific validity of risk reduction interventions are important, customizing these strategies to ethnically specific modes of interaction are equally important.\r"

  ".W": "Community-wide surveys were conducted in Winona and St. Cloud, MN, Eau Claire, WI, and Sioux Falls, SD, in 1986 and 1987 to determine the current status of the supply and demand of health promotion activities in nine categories. Supply and demand indicators were conceptualized and defined as program options (different activities in a coded list) and participation (registrations). An annual inventory of all health promotion activities in each community was complied from interviews with providers of such activities. Interviews of probable community providers was followed by a nomination process to identify others. Providers at worksites were interviewed in a separate study with matching data endpoints. Results show that exercise programs have the highest levels of options and participation in all four cities. On the supply side of total programs offered, there was similarity in rates among three of the cities, with only Winona offering more health promotion opportunities. There was similarity also in the areas of health where most programs are offered, favoring exercise, followed by the heart disease risk factor areas of screening, smoking cessation, and nutrition education. On the demand side of participation, there was similarity in total participation rates among three of the four cities with Sioux Falls showing substantially higher demand. Exercise showed the highest participation in all cities, but there was little similarity among the cities in ranking participation in the other areas of health promotion. In the four cities combined, high levels of program options with low participation were characteristic of smoking cessation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91271517\r", 
  ".W": "In July 1989 an outbreak of shigellosis occurred among visitors to a recreational park in Oakland County, MI. An epidemiologic investigation discovered an association between illness and swimming in a pond at the park, especially for those who had put their head underwater. No other factors were epidemiologically incriminated. A total of 65 cases were identified; nine were culture confirmed, all Shigella sonnei. Several water samples evaluated for fecal coliform counts shortly after the outbreak were found satisfactory. Cultures of water samples were negative for Shigella species. Inspection of the park's sewage disposal and toilet facilities found all equipment in proper working condition and no evidence of a sewage contamination event from these potential sources. No other commercial or residential sources of potential sewage contamination existed near the pond. Investigators concluded that Shigella contamination of the pond by a swimmer or swimmers on one or more occasions was a strong possibility. Factors supporting this conclusion included elevated incidence of S. sonnei in the community during the 2 months prior to the outbreak, greater use of the pond, warm water and air temperatures, and inadequate water exchange in the pond. This report adds one of the few documented outbreaks of shigellosis implicating bather contamination to the literature on the growing number of incidents that have been associated with recreational use of water.\r"

  ".U": "91271518\r", 
  ".W": "Dientamoeba fragilis is a pathogenic protozoan parasite that has no cyst stage. Because of the lack of a cyst stage, the laboratory detection of D. fragilis in stool specimens is dependent on the stool processing and examination methods employed. Failure to use recommended stool fixation and permanent staining techniques almost precludes identification of D. fragilis, which is associated with gastrointestinal illness in humans. In this survey, questionnaires were mailed to all State and territorial public health laboratories requesting information on the number of ova and parasite examinations, methods of processing and examining stools, and the number of D. fragilis positive stools for 1985. Forty-three of 54 (80 percent) laboratories responded. Results showed that those laboratories which reported D. fragilis detection examined more stools using recommended stool fixation methods and were more likely to stain permanently all stools examined. Permanent staining of all stools, as compared to loose and watery stools only, resulted in a fivefold greater detection of D. fragilis. More State and territorial public health laboratories reported finding D. fragilis infections in 1985 than in a 1978 survey performed by the Centers for Disease Control. However, in 1985 only six laboratories reported 82 percent of all D. fragilis detections. To increase the probability of detecting D. fragilis in stool specimens, the findings suggest that all stools should be submitted fixed in polyvinyl alcohol fixative, sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin fixative, or Schaudinn's fixative. Further, all specimens, regardless of consistency, should be permanently stained prior to microscopic examination.\r"

For the mortality-related measures, age-specific and age-adjusted rates are also calculated. The pivotal epidemiologic measure in these calculations is the smoking-attributable fraction, and attributal risk measure. A multiple-measure approach (attributable mortality and economic costs) to quantifying a health problem is termed \"disease impact estimation.\" Previously, national and State-specific estimates of smoking-attributable mortality and economic costs were calculated using SAMMEC software, the predecessor of SAMMEC II. SAMMEC II is completely menu-driven and operates within the Lotus 1-2-3 software as a set of linked spreadsheets. SAMMEC II adapts national epidemiologic methods for use by State and local health departments. Increased exposure of public health professionals to disease impact estimation techniques, as demonstrated by SAMMEC II, will lead to improvements in both methodology and the quality of smoking-related health data. The primary purpose of SAMMEC II, however, is to provide State or locality-specific data on the health consequences of smoking to policymakers and public health professionals in these jurisdictions.\r"

Because sample surveys are expensive, indirect methods of estimation using secondary data sources are frequently used to arrive at quick annual estimates. Census data on poverty are often incorporated into such methods, but out study of the eight southeast States in Federal Region IV shows that available census data severely underestimate the proportion of pregnant women who are poor. Updated poverty data from the 1990 census will not solve this problem of underestimation. Alternative methods for estimating the number of women in need of subsidized prenatal care services, for measuring unmet need, and for doing estimates on the county level are presented and evaluated. Such considerations are especially important, given the new Title V block grant reporting requirements.\r"

Although a two-dose schedule had been under discussion for the previous 10 years, this policy change was finally prompted in New York State by widespread measles outbreaks in 1989 among college and high school students who had been appropriately vaccinated with a single dose of measles vaccine. These outbreaks affected 21 college and secondary school campuses with 91 cases of measles and led to the administration of 53,093 doses of vaccine at a cost in excess of $859,000 for vaccine alone. In addition, there were major disruptions of intercollegiate athletic and scholastic events and physician and public confusion over the different recommendations for \"outbreak\" versus \"routine\" measles immunization. In response, the New York State Department of Health adopted a policy of two doses of measles vaccine required for entrance into kindergarten and college beginning in the fall of 1990. This report describes the data and process that were used in reaching this policy decision.\r"

The efficacy of this therapeutic maneuver has not been thoroughly tested. We studied 26 subjects with fasting serum glucose (FSG) levels greater than 8.3 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) despite maximum doses of either GB (20 mg/day) or GZ (40 mg/day). Group 1 consisted of 16 subjects taking GB (mean FSG = 12.7 mmol/L [228 mg/dL]) and group 2 included 10 subjects taking GZ (mean FSG = 13.0 mmol/L [234 mg/dL]). Subjects continued taking their original SGS for 8 weeks then switched to a maximum dose of the alternate agent for an additional 8 weeks. Values for FSG, hemoglobin A1c, and lipids were recorded before the study and after 8 weeks on each SGS trial. No significant changes were noted for any variable in either group. When maximum dose GB therapy was compared to maximum dose GZ therapy in the combined study group (n = 26), no advantage was noted for either agent. We conclude that metabolic control in NIDDM patients failing to respond to therapy with maximum dose GB or GZ is not improved by switching to the alternate SGS.\r"

The mean concentration of tissue-type plasminogen activator in the hematoma content was higher than that in the plasma. The more the sinusoids in the outer membrane were developed, the higher the concentration of tissue-type plasminogen activator contained in the hematoma fluid. In chronic subdural hematoma, overproduction and oversecretion of tissue-type plasminogen activator from the sinusoidal and capillary endothelial cells in the outer membrane cause increased fibrinolysis, which in turn impairs hemostasis, and hemorrhage from the capillaries recurs, resulting in enlargement of the chronic subdural hematoma.\r"

Relaxations caused by nicotine, K+, arachidonic acid, and prostaglandin I2 were suppressed, but the relaxant response to calcium ionophore A23187 and substance P did not change significantly. These results suggest that contractions mediated via activation of alpha, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and prostaglandin F2 alpha receptors are potentiated, and relaxations caused by stimulation of vasodilator nerves and by endogenous and exogenous prostaglandin I2 are attenuated in dog basilar arteries exposed to subarachnoid clot. On the other hand, certain relaxations possibly mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor do not appear to be significantly influenced.\r"

Changes in platelet function have been reported previously in migraine sufferers and there is evidence that hyperaggregability occurs during a migraine attack. It was decided to assess platelet aggregation with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from nicardipine-treated migraine sufferers because dihydropyridine derivatives are known to inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- and epinephrine-induced aggregation. Aggregation induced by 1.4 mumol/L arachidonic acid was similar in PRP from control subjects and untreated migraine sufferers, whereas 1 or 2 mumol/L ADP-induced aggregation was lower in PRP from migraine sufferers. Treatment with 20 mg of nicardipine three times daily for 2 months significantly (p less than 0.05) increased 2 mumol/L ADP-induced aggregation.

The tumor cells of malignant histiocytosis generally expressed the monocyte markers CD11b, CD11c, CD14, and CD45, especially after induction with phorbol ester. In contrast, the tumor cells of true histiocytic lymphoma exhibited a marker expression very similar to that of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease. These cells expressed markers CD30, 2H9, and 1A2, but rarely expressed CD11b, CD11c, CD14, or CD45. Regardless of their cytologic features, the tumor cells from both types of histiocytic lymphoma exhibited diffuse nonspecific esterase and acid phosphatase activities, and they expressed histiocyte markers CD15, CD68, LN5, 1E9, and M387 to varying degrees. The tumor cells from both lymphomas did not exhibit T- or B-cell markers, T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, or gene translation products, even when they were induced with phorbol ester. The phenotypic expression in these two histiocytic malignancies suggests that they are derived from different types of histiocytes, or from histiocytes in different stages of maturation or differentiation, or from histiocytes that have distinct mechanisms of tumorigenic transformation. The expression of circulating monocyte markers in malignant histiocytosis suggests that this tumor originates in monocytes or free histiocytes, whereas the phenotype of true histiocytic lymphoma is compatible with an origin in fixed histiocytes, which generally are devoid of the monocyte markers CD11b and CD14.\r"

  ".W": "Progressive cerebral deposition of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta P) occurs in Alzheimer's disease and during aging of certain mammals (eg, human, monkey, dog) but not others (eg, mouse, rat). The authors cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA encoding the beta-protein precursor (beta APP) of cynomolgus monkey. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 695-residue protein is completely homologous to that of human. The alternatively transcribed exons encoding the Kunitz protease inhibitor region in monkey were cloned, showing only a single conservative amino acid substitution in the 751-residue form of beta APP and four substitutions in beta APP770. Immunoblots of cerebral cortex with antibodies to various beta APP domains showed highly similar beta APP polypeptides in human and monkey, in contrast to those of mouse and rat. The latter differences reflect sequence substitutions, transcriptional regulation, and possibly post-translational modifications that may decrease the amyloidogenic potential of rodent beta APP. Immunocytochemistry of aged cynomolgus brain showed A beta P deposited in blood vessels and diffuse and compacted plaques closely resembling those of humans, and the presence of beta-amyloid-associated proteins (alpha 1-antichymotrypsin; complements C1q and C3c) characteristic of A beta P deposits in Alzheimer's disease. The authors' findings demonstrate that cynomolgus monkey and perhaps other primates provide a close animal model for examining the early transcriptional and post-translational processing of beta APP that precedes A beta P deposition during aging and in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

The authors have studied a series of 44 T-cell lymphomas with a panel of seven reagents reactive with four different TCR beta-chain variable region families. The authors found that, with this limited panel, restricted V gene usage of the neoplastic cells could be demonstrated in 29% of TCR-positive lymphomas. Whereas this is somewhat higher than expected, no preferential use of specific families could be demonstrated. An additional, unexpected finding was that most large cell T-cell lymphomas did not express TCR despite the presence of cytoplasmic CD3. The findings indicate that with a somewhat expanded panel it should be feasible to demonstrate restricted V gene usage as an indicator of clonality in a majority of T-cell lymphomas in a manner similar to the application of anti-immunoglobulin subclass antibodies in the diagnosis of clonal B cell proliferations.\r"

This method is based on the densitometric evaluation of the multiband pattern of TCR-gamma gene rearrangements detectable in Southern blot analyses of polyclonal T-cell DNA digested with HindIII. These rearrangements can be detected down to a limit of approximately 5% T-cell DNA. The information derived from this type of analysis can be used to roughly assess the total T-cell content of lesional tissue specimens expressed as a percentage of total tissue DNA, and can be correlated with the pattern of T-cell infiltration visualized by immunohistology. This assessment can be used also to determine the threshold, expressed as a percentage of total lesional T-cell DNA instead of total tissue DNA, required for the detection of a monoclonal T-cell population by Southern blot analysis. These quantitative relationships may prove useful for studying cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and associated precursor conditions.\r"

  ".W": "To define further the characteristics of CD8+ cells in skin lesions of CD3+ CD4+ mycosis fungoides (MF), the authors used single- and double-label immunohistologic techniques and in situ hybridization to detect antigens and transcripts associated with certain types of cytotoxic or suppressor function. The cytotoxic markers included CD16, CD56, CD57, and an anti-sense probe for human Hanukah factor (HuHf) mRNA. Analysis of 23 cases demonstrated that lesional CD8+ cells were CD3+ T cells that generally lacked expression of any of the cytotoxic markers studied. Analysis of another 10 cases confirmed the CD3+ T-cell lineage of lesional CD8+ cells and demonstrated that these cells also lacked expression of the suppressor-associated marker, CD11b. In aggregate, these results indicate that most CD8+ cells in CD3+ CD4+ MF skin lesions are of T-cell rather than NK-cell differentiation. Their overall phenotype suggests that they may be major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T cells lacking appreciable levels of HuHF serine protease. Because the induction of CD8+ suppressor T cells is mediated by CD4+ T cells expressing the CD45RA+ RO- phenotype, CD45 epitope expression was studied in 15 MF cases. The vast majority (13/15) contained CD3+ CD4+ tumor cells that were CD45+ RA- RB+ RO+ 2B11+. This phenotype is consistent with memory T cells rather than suppressor-inducer T cells, and correlates with the paucity of phenotypically defined suppressor T cells in CD3+ CD4+ MF skin lesions.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the impact of budgeting based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) on inpatient psychiatric care in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. DRG-based budgeting was implemented by the VA in 1984 and suspended in 1988. METHOD: Computerized discharge abstracts were obtained for all episodes of VA inpatient care occurring from 1980 through 1989. The number of discharges per year, number of unduplicated patients treated, mean length of stay, total number of bed days of care per unique patient per year, readmission rates, and number of episodes of care per operational bed were determined for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric (medical-surgical) hospitalizations occurring before, during, and after DRG-based budgeting was in effect. RESULTS: In the case of VA psychiatric care, DRG-based budgeting was associated with more episodes of care, shorter lengths of stay, higher readmission rates, and more episodes of care per occupied bed. DRG-based budgeting had similar effects on medical-surgical care, although an increase in the number of episodes of care was not observed. During the first year after this funding mechanism was suspended, changes in both psychiatric and medical-surgical care that were related to DRG-based budgeting were slowed and, in some cases, reversed. CONCLUSIONS: Both psychiatric and medical-surgical inpatient care in the VA were sensitive to changes in funding mechanisms. These changes were generally similar to those observed in psychiatric care provided by non-VA hospitals reimbursed under Medicare's DRG-based prospective payment system.\r"

Although residential clients experienced the largest relative changes in weeks worked and real earnings, a benefit-cost calculation suggests that additional residential treatment cannot be justified from earnings improvements alone. These results may indicate a need for more employment services while in treatment.\r"

Most of these deaths could be prevented if the tractors were equipped with roll-over protective structures (ROPS). This study estimates the number of tractors in New York without ROPS, projects their retirement, and then estimates the number of lives which would be saved if ROPS were retrofitted on old tractors. The basic costs associated with mandating ROPS are calculated from these estimates. The minimum economic cost of mandating ROPS is $511,136 per life saved for the retrofits, and an additional $253,254 per life saved for every $1 million spent annually on enforcement. It is concluded that a policy mandating ROPS on all tractors would be expensive, but should be considered with particular attention to the need for and cost effectiveness of enforcement.\r"

Indications included gastric stasis after gastric surgery (11 patients), gastroparesis and reflux or both in critically ill trauma patients (10), stricture secondary to vertical banded gastroplasty (3), and partial gastric outlet obstruction (5). Two endoscopic techniques were used. The guidewire method in which a flexible, Silastic feeding tube is advanced over the guidewire to the desired site had 82 per cent success (22 of 27). Adjunct fluoroscopy achieved a 94 per cent success rate (17 of 18); success without fluoroscopy was 56 per cent (5 of 9). The pull-along method attached a suture to the feeding tube tip which was grasped with forceps and moved to the correct location (93% success; 13 of 14). Fluoroscopy was not used with this method. Feeding tubes were successfully placed in 35 of 41 attempts (85%) in 27 of 29 patients. Failures were caused by an inability to intubate the efferent limb of a gastrojejunostomy (2) and unrecognized guidewire movement (4). Tube use ranged from one day to six months. We conclude that endoscopic placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes is an effective means to establish a route for enteral nutrition in selected patients.\r"

There were three postoperative complications. Ten patients were discharged (5 home, 5 skilled facility) and six expired. All patients had functioning tracheostomies and PEGs at the time of disposition.

We injected a mixture of thrombin, sodium tetradecyl, and cefazolin and studied the effect of this sclerosant on selected hemostasis parameters. Twenty-four patients with liver cirrhosis (Child's Classification C) were studied 29 times. Blood samples were drawn before and immediately after the injection of the sclerosant. In seven patients we collected a sample 30 minutes and 24 hours after treatment. Before injection, almost all patients had elevated D-dimer, t-PA and PAI-1 levels. Fibrinogen, antithrombin, alpha-2 antiplasmin, and protein C were decreased. Only thrombin/antithrombin III complex (TAT) levels were within normal ranges. Immediately after the injection, TAT, D-dimer, and t-PA levels rose significantly (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001), PAI-1 and PC levels decreased (P less than 0.01), while antithrombin, alpha-2 antiplasmin, and fibrinogen concentrations were unchanged. TAT and D-dimer levels were still elevated after 24 hours (P less than 0.05). These data indicate that thrombin entered the systemic circulation (elevated TAT) and that the hemostasis system was briefly systemically activated (elevated D-dimer). In spite of these changes in the hemostasis system, clinically there were no detectable thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications.\r"

Eleven of these children (eight girls and three boys) all more than 10 years of age (mean follow up 8.1 years; range 3-13) had thrombotic episodes (9%). Thrombosis was one of the presenting signs in seven patients; in five it was associated with typical symptoms of SLE, and in the other two the thrombotic episode was isolated and diagnosis of SLE was delayed one and three years. Of a total of 16 thrombotic episodes (six of which were recurrent), 14 involved the leg veins, and in four there was associated pulmonary embolism. There were two episodes that affected cerebral arteries. The American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for SLE as well as the incidence of lupus anticoagulant, positive direct Coombs test, and vasculitis in this group of patients was compared with the incidence in patients with SLE but no thrombosis. Only lupus anticoagulant was significantly associated with thrombotic episodes: eight of 11 (73%) of patients with SLE and thrombotic (arterial or venous) episodes had lupus anticoagulant compared with only 10 of 74 patients (14%) with no history of thrombotic events in the same age group.\r"

These signs are not observed in animals infected with a canine strain of T. cruzi (Tc-D). To understand the biochemical basis for these early cardiac effects, we examined the beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase complex in myocardial membranes prepared from animals infected with either of the two strains. In animals infected with Tc-O (symptomatic), the maximum velocity (Vmax) decreased and concentration of agonist resulting in 50% of Vmax (Kact) increased for isoproterenol-dependent adenylate cyclase activity; in animals infected with Tc-D (asymptomatic), Vmax and Kact for isoproterenol were unchanged from control, uninfected animals. beta-Receptor density decreased by 20% in symptomatic animals with no change in affinity, whereas no differences were observed between uninfected and infected asymptomatic animals. A complex pattern of changes was apparent in the guanine nucleotide binding protein, Gs, in the setting of infection. Alterations in cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation patterns as well as immunochemical detection with anti-G alpha s antisera suggested a change in the biochemical nature of the Gs species and not necessarily a physical loss of this protein. Reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity in cyc- membranes demonstrated a decrease in hormone-sensitive Gs activity in membranes prepared from symptomatic animals without a change in activity demonstrable in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. Collectively, the results suggest that the depression in beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase activity associated with symptomatic infection of beagles with T. cruzi occurs primarily as a result of changes in the Gs protein complex, most likely resulting in an uncoupling of the beta-adrenergic receptor from the Gs protein.\r"

DESIGNS: Patients were prospectively randomized to treatment with total parenteral nutrition, either alone, with sucralfate, or with ranitidine. SETTING: A multidisciplinary ICU from a tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients submitted to prolonged mechanical ventilation, with normal hepatic and renal function, in metabolic stress, and receiving total parenteral nutrition. INTERVENTIONS: On admission, we determined the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and the catabolic index score. We also performed an endoscopic examination on day 3, every 7 days subsequently, and whenever needed. Thirty patients received total parenteral nutrition alone. Twenty-four patients received total parenteral nutrition and sucralfate (1 g by nasogastric tube every 4 hrs). Nineteen patients received total parenteral nutrition and ranitidine (50 mg iv every 6 hrs). MAIN RESULTS: The overall occurrence rate of gastroduodenal mucosal damage was 29.6%. The overall frequency rate for stress ulcerations was 15.6% and was 6.2% for stress hemorrhage. There were no deaths secondary to stress hemorrhage. The difference in the frequency of stress-induced mucosal lesions and stress hemorrhage between the studied groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Additional prophylaxis to total parenteral nutrition in the form of sucralfate and ranitidine to prevent acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not required in this group of ICU patients.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective study of recently intubated, mechanically ventilated patients. SETTING: The medical ICU in a county hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-two mechanically ventilated medical ICU patients were studied within 36 hrs of intubation. Patients were all supported with volume-cycled ventilation in the assist-control mode. INTERVENTIONS: Timed expired gas collection and an arterial blood gas. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measurements of minute ventilation and CO2 production (VCO2) were made from a timed expired gas collection. PaCO2 was sampled during the gas collection and deadspace was determined. Minute ventilation, VCO2, deadspace, and PaCO2 values in the patients were compared with predicted normal values, and excess minute ventilation due specifically to each component was calculated. Patients were separated clinically into groups: adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, obstructive lung disease, pneumonia, and drug overdose. Comparisons were then made between groups. Excess minute ventilation for the entire study population was secondary to increased deadspace (39%), low PaCO2 (36%), increased VCO2 (15%), and the interactive effect of deadspace and VCO2 (10%). VCO2 contributed little to excess minute ventilation early in respiratory failure, even in the ARDS and sepsis groups. Deadspace contributed significantly to excess minute ventilation in all groups, especially in the ARDS group, where it accounted for 53% of the excess ventilation. Low PaCO2 set-point was the predominant cause of excess minute ventilation in the sepsis group, where it contributed to 57% of their total excess minute ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Although all groups initiated on mechanical ventilation had an excess ventilatory requirement, the contribution of individual components varied considerably between clinical groups.\r"

SETTING: Surgical and pediatric ICUs in a tertiary care university hospital. RESULTS: When expired minute volume was measured over a range of 4 to 28 L in six intubated patients, expired minute volume measured by the prototype system demonstrated a correlation coefficient of .998 compared with simultaneous expired minute volume measured by a Tissot spirometer. Organic solvent combustion demonstrated a maximum error of 3.8% for oxygen consumption (VO2) and an average error of 1.73 +/- 1.25% (SEM). The maximum error for the respiratory quotient was 3.0%, with an average error of 1.75 +/- 1.07%. VO2 (predicted) vs. VO2 (measured) demonstrated a correlation coefficient of .997. Validation with the nitrogen dilution method over a range of FIO2 from 0.21 to 0.60 demonstrated a maximum error of 7.9%, with an average error of -1.72 +/- 1.1% (n = 51).

  ".U": "91275759\r", 
  ".W": "We have reported previously that thyroid gland blood flow, expressed as vascular conductance (C) per mass, is decreased at very low and increased at very high chronic plasma TSH concentrations, but is apparently unchanged over a broad range of plasma TSH concentrations encompassing normal levels. The aim of the present study was to examine the apparently very steep dose-response relationship between elevated plasma TSH and thyroid vascular C/mass. In the first series of experiments, endogenous plasma TSH concentrations were manipulated by treating male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-280 g) for 6 days as follows: 1) controls (0.5 ml saline/day, ip), 2) propylthiouracil injections (2.0 mg PTU/day, ip), 3) PTU plus partial thyroid hormone replacement (2.0 mg PTU/day and 0.3-0.9 microgram T4 plus 0.075-0.225 microgram T3/100 g.day via continuous sc infusion), or 4) TRH (9-1200 micrograms TRH/100 g.day via continuous iv infusion). The vascular C values of the thyroid gland, salivary gland, kidney, and pancreas were determined using the reference sample version of the radioactive microsphere technique. PTU treatment led to the expected hypothyroidism, increased plasma TSH concentrations (959 +/- 66 vs. 154 +/- 22 ng/dl), increased thyroid weight (9.19 +/- 0.36 vs. 4.60 +/- 0.15 mg/100 g), and increased thyroid vascular C/mass (495 +/- 51 vs. 127 +/- 20 microliters/mm Hg.g/min). PTU-treated rats receiving partial thyroid hormone replacement demonstrated a dose-related suppression of plasma TSH, thyroid weight, and thyroid vascular C. Although, TRH treatments resulted in increased plasma TSH concentrations (e.g. 1200 micrograms TRH, 706 +/- 46 ng/dl) and thyroid weight (e.g. 1200 micrograms TRH, 7.45 +/- 0.41 mg/100 g), thyroid vascular C per tissue mass was not significantly increased after any TRH treatment (e.g. 1200 micrograms TRH, 166 +/- 19 microliters/mm Hg.g/min). Thus, at similarly elevated plasma TSH concentrations, the thyroid vascular C/mass of PTU- and TRH-treated rats constituted separate populations. Both PTU- and TRH-induced thyroid growth were accompanied by similar alterations in thyroid gland morphology (i.e. increased cellular mass with little change in the total amount of colloid). To investigate the mechanisms involved, groups of rats were treated for 6 days as follows: 1) control, 2) PTU or methimazole (25 mg MMI/day, ip), 3) PTU or MMI plus thyroid hormone replacement (1.2 micrograms T4 plus 0.3 microgram T3/d.100 g), 4) TRH (12 micrograms/100 g.day), and 5) PTU or MMI, thyroid hormones, and TRH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

However, there was no effect on adenylate cyclase activity in membranes from STZ diabetic animals. Also, a polyclonal antipeptide antibody was raised to a highly conserved segment of the Gi alpha 2 subunit. This antibody specifically recognizes a 41 kilodalton protein, is blocked by an excess of peptide, does not recognize the alpha-subunit of transducin, and immunoprecipitates a 41 kilodalton protein which was ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin. Immunoblots using this antibody detect no difference between normal and STZ diabetic animals in the level of liver plasma membrane Gi expression. Therefore, STZ-induced diabetes altered the function of Gi but had no effect on Gi expression.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies demonstrate that several cytokines are potent modulators of steroid release from the testis. In an attempt to determine whether these agents may influence other types of secreted substances, we used plaque assays to measure the effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha on transferrin (TF) release from Sertoli cells in culture. Because Sertoli cells from different parts of the tubule respond differently to modulatory factors, we used cultures obtained by microdissection from stages III-V, VII, IX-XI, and XIII of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. Our results revealed that each agent increased the rate of TF plaque formation from cultures of IX-XI, and XIII staged segments but not from those staged III-V and VII. Moreover, IL-6, but not the other cytokines, modified the response of Sertoli cells to another regulator, FSH. This was evidenced by our findings that pretreatment with IL-6 for 1 h resulted in FSH-induced increases in the rate of plaque formation for cells from IX-XI segments, in addition to those segments which are normally responsive without pretreatment (III-V and VII segments). Further experiments revealed that IL-6 also had a chronic influence on the proportion of TF secretors present in certain staged cultures. Treatment for 24 h with IL-6 markedly reduced the percentage of TF secretors in cultures from stage XIII segments and resulted in a slight increase in TF cells for stage VII cultures. However, no chronic influences in TF secretors were detected with either IL-2 or tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment. Our results demonstrate very clearly that certain cytokines acting in a stage specific manner have acute and/or chronic influences on the release of TF from Sertoli cells. These findings, when viewed in light of reports of the presence of these factors in the testis, suggest strongly that cytokines or cytokine-like substances, by modulating the release of Sertoli cell substances, may play an important role in testis function.\r"

  ".W": "The keratinocyte has receptors for, responds to, and produces both tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D]. Both TNF and 1,25-(OH)2D facilitate the differentiation of keratinocytes. To explore the possibility that TNF stimulates keratinocyte differentiation at least in part by regulating 1,25-(OH)2D production we examined the effect of TNF on both 1,25-(OH)2D production and differentiation (transglutaminase activity, cornified envelope formation) at different stages of differentiation. 1,25-(OH)2D production, transglutaminase activity, and cornified envelope formation are sequentially increased during differentiation such that 1,25-(OH)2D production occurs first, followed by transglutaminase activity and, finally, cornified envelope formation. In preconfluent cells, TNF stimulated 1,25-(OH)2D production. Interferon-gamma also stimulated 1,25-(OH)2D production at low concentrations, but this was not additive to that by TNF. The stimulatory effect of TNF was maximal after 1-2 days of incubation and decreased with prolonged incubation. TNF had little effect on cornified envelope formation and transglutaminase activity in the preconfluent cells. Once keratinocytes achieved confluence, TNF stimulated transglutaminase activity and cornified envelope formation, but inhibited 1,25-(OH)2D production. Our results suggest that TNF regulates 1,25-(OH)2D production as part of its ability to accelerate keratinocyte differentiation; whether TNF stimulates or inhibits 1,25-(OH)2D production depends on whether TNF is added before or after the cell has reached its maximal capacity to make 1,25-(OH)2D.\r"

  ".W": "Peritubular cells that surround the seminiferous tubules have been shown to produce a paracrine factor, termed P-Mod-S, that has dramatic effects on Sertoli cell function in vitro and is postulated to be important in the control of testicular function. The current study was designed to determine whether P-Mod-S has the ability to regulate Sertoli cell function during pubertal development. Sertoli cells were isolated from 10-, 20-, and 35-day-old rats which correspond to the prepubertal, mid-pubertal, and late pubertal stages of development. Histochemical analysis of cultured cells isolated from each age group was performed to establish the purity of the cell populations used. Testicular transferrin production by Sertoli cells was used as a marker of cellular differentiation. Basal production of transferrin by the cultured cells was found to increase during the pubertal period. P-Mod-S stimulated transferrin production by Sertoli cells isolated from 10-, 20-, and 35-day-old rats. FSH appears to enhance the ability of Sertoli cells to respond to P-Mod-S with cells obtained from 10-day-old rats. Sertoli cells from 35-day-old rats were nonresponsive to regulatory agents such as FSH. P-Mod-S alone, however, significantly stimulated transferrin production by Sertoli cells from this more adult stage of development. P-Mod-S was the only individual regulatory agent tested that could stimulate transferrin production by Sertoli cells from 35-day-old rats. Results indicate that P-Mod-S has the ability to regulate Sertoli cell function throughout pubertal development. Observations suggest that P-Mod-S and FSH may act together in the prepubertal testis to promote Sertoli cell differentiation and that P-Mod-S may act in the adult testis to maintain optimal Sertoli cell function and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "In the juvenile male rhesus monkey in which an adult-like pattern of endocrine activity in the pituitary-testicular axis is imposed by pulsatile stimulation with exogenous GnRH, administration of inhibin antiserum elicits a marked and selective hypersecretion of FSH. This finding suggests that in the monkey, testicular inhibin plays a major role in the postpubertal regulation of this gonadotropin. The purpose of the present study was to confirm this view more directly. To this end, 10 adult male rhesus monkeys were implanted with indwelling venous catheters and housed in specialized cages that permit continuous access to the venous circulation with minimal restraint and without tranquilization. Six of the males received a continuous infusion of an ovine antiserum to the alpha-subunit of human inhibin (iv bolus injection of 2.22 ml/kg BW, followed by a continuous infusion of serum at 0.62 ml/kg BW.24 h), and 4 animals received a similar infusion of control ovine immune serum. The duration of the infusion of the inhibin antiserum ranged from 2.5-7.5 days, and that for the control serum was 7.5 days. The FSH response to immunoneutralization of circulating inhibin was determined by measuring concentrations of this gonadotropin in sequential plasma samples collected between 1900-2300 h on the day before initiation of the anti-serum infusion and, depending on the duration of the infusion, on days 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 of antiserum administration. In 5 of the 6 animals that received the inhibin antiserum, a progressive hypersecretion of FSH was observed during the initial 2.5 days of the infusion. This increase in circulating FSH concentration, which reached, by day 2.5 of treatment, a value 2- to 3-fold greater (P less than 0.05) than the pretreatment control level, was not associated with changes in either LH or testosterone levels. Continuation of the infusion of the inhibin antiserum beyond 2.5 days invariably resulted in a marked decline in LH and testosterone secretion, suggesting that the hypophysiotropic drive to the pituitary-testicular axis may have been compromised, presumably by a mechanism related to the infusion of heterologous serum. Infusion of the control immune serum for 2.5 days was not associated with an elevation of circulating FSH concentrations, and changes in circulating concentrations of plasma LH and testosterone were, as expected, unremarkable. Continuation of the infusion of control serum, like that of antiserum, generally resulted in a temporary but precipitous decline in LH and testosterone secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The actions of CCK8 were inhibited by lanthanum and manganese, agents that block transmembrane calcium fluxes, and by chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA. In pancreatic acini, lanthanum and manganese also partially inhibited the effects of carbachol and bombesin on Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 levels. In acini, the CCK8-mediated increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 levels were progressively greater as the extracellular calcium concentration was raised from the micromolar range to 1.28 mM and progressively smaller as the manganese concentration was raised from 10 microM to 1 mM. Furthermore, the CCK8-mediated rise in Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels was partially attenuated by the calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. These findings indicate that extracellular calcium enhances the ability of CCK8 and other calcium-mobilizing agonists to generate biologically active inositol phosphates in pancreatic acinar cells.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous and CRF-stimulated changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were studied in two types of corticotrophs: 1) cultured human ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma cells (hACTH cells), and 2) identified small ovoid corticotrophs cultured from normal rat pituitaries. [Ca2+]i was monitored in individual corticotrophs by dual emission microspectrofluorimetry using indo-1 as the intracellular fluorescent Ca2+ probe. In hACTH cells, [Ca2+]i measurements were carried out in combination with electrophysiological recordings obtained using whole cell patch-clamp techniques. It was shown that a single spontaneous Ca(2+)-dependent action potential led to a marked transient increase in [Ca2+]i in human tumoral corticotrophs. Spontaneous fluctuations in [Ca2+]i were also observed in unpatched corticotrophs whether derived from human pituitary tumors or normal rat tissue. Based on their striking kinetic features and their sensitivity to external Ca2+, we suggest that these spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients were the consequence of action potential firing. Under separate voltage-clamp (patch-clamp) conditions, tumor corticotrophs showed two Ca2+ current components: a low threshold, rapidly inactivating (T-type) current, and a higher threshold, slowly inactivating (L-type) current. The dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker PN 200-110 (100 nM) abolished the L-type current without affecting the T-type current, while the inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+ (200 microM) suppressed both Ca2+ currents. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (5 microM) did not affect inward currents in tumor corticotrophs. Both L- and T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were involved in controlling [Ca2+]i transients in both tumor and normal corticotrophs, inasmuch as Cd2+ (200 microM) abolished [Ca2+]i) transients, while PN 200-110 (100 nM) greatly diminished, but did not completely abolish, [Ca2+]i transients. The latter did not appear to depend on a voltage-dependent Na+ influx, since they were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (5 microM). Corticotrophs generate [Ca2+]i transients in response to the hypothalamic secretagogue CRF by acting on their membrane excitability. Indeed, we demonstrated in combined fluorescent and electrophysiological experiments that CRF (100 nM) had a coordinate action on human tumoral corticotrophs comprised of a modest depolarization and an increase in the frequency of both action potentials and subsequent [Ca2+]i transients. A coincident increase in the peak amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient and after hyperpolarization was also observed in some CRF-stimulated cells. CRF (100 nM) evoked qualitatively similar [Ca2+]i patterns in human tumoral and normal rat corticotrophs not subjected to patch-clamping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dual wavelength digital imaging microscopy to detect fura-2 has been employed to characterize in normal bovine PRL-secreting cells the effects of TRH and dopamine on the intracellular ionized calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i). Concentrations of TRH greater than 10 nM caused a rapid but transient increase in [Ca2+]i, arising mainly from intracellular calcium stores, since it was unaffected by lowering extracellular calcium with EGTA or blocking calcium channels with Co2+. The threshold for TRH action was close to 0.1 nM. TRH action was dose dependent, with lower concentrations (less than 1-10 nM) slowing the time to peak [Ca2+]i response. The TRH-induced [Ca2+]i rise had a Q10 of about 2. TRH caused multiple transient increases in [Ca2+]i, but a recovery time of 10-15 min was required for full restoration of the TRH-induced response. In some cells the [Ca2+]i response to TRH was polarized to one region of the cell, suggesting the following possibilities, none of them exclusive: 1) Ca2+ release sites may be localized within the cell; or 2) an efficient local mechanism exists for lowering Ca2+ once it is liberated inside the cells; or 3) barriers may exist to diffusion of Ca2+ released within the cell. Extracellular application of Co2+, Mn2+, and EGTA under basal conditions resulted in lowering of [Ca2+]i within seconds, consistent with tonic Ca2+ influx under resting conditions which could contribute to the basal release of hormone. Dopamine, a PRL release-inhibiting factor, also lowered [Ca2+]i under basal conditions. However, the [Ca2+]i response of lactotrophs to TRH was unaffected by dopamine. This suggests that dopamine and TRH act via separate intracellular pathways to modulate hormone secretion. Applications of forskolin preceding the TRH-induced transient rise in [Ca2+]i resulted in a prolonged plateau rise in [Ca2+]i. This was mainly due to increased influx of Ca2+ since addition of Co2+ or EGTA-containing or Ca(2+)-free medium during this phase of response lowered the plateau concentration of [Ca2+]i.\r"

  ".W": "Granulosa cell lines, transformed by SV40 T-antigen and Ha-ras oncogene, have recently been established that can produce progesterone at levels comparable to those of highly differentiated cultures of primary granulosa cells (1-4). Here, the hypothesis that these cells contain a mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, and that stimulation of the receptor can trigger progesterone production in these cells, was tested. The agonist of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, Ro5-4864, produced a 3- to 5-fold stimulation (P less than 0.005) of progesterone production both in differentiated granulosa primary cultures and in the oncogene-transformed cell lines. Ro5-2807 (diazepam, Valium) exerts a similar effect on granulosa cell steroidogenesis while the specific agonist of central benzodiazepine receptor Ro15-4513 was without effect. The effects of Ro5-4864 or Ro5-2807 were not additive to those of gonadotropins and cAMP. Intact isolated mitochondria possessed high-affinity binding sites to [3H]-Ro5-4864 (Kd = 3.03 +/- 0.70 nM), which were enriched by 1 order of magnitude in these organelles compared to total cell homogenate. Bound Ro5-4864 could be competitively displaced with 1 microM unlabeled Ro5-4864 and Ro5-2807, but not with specific ligands of central benzodiazepine receptors Ro15-4513 and Ro15-1788. Prolonged elevation of cAMP in these cells caused a 30% (P less than 0.01) rise in the number of receptors. Mitochondria of NIH 3T3 cells contained only 30-40% (P less than 0.001) of the Ro5-4864 binding sites of mitochondria from steroidogenic cells, whereas yeast mitochondria lacked them completely. The existence of functional peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in mitochondria suggests that they may have a physiological role in the mobilization of cholesterol into mitochondria, and in elevating progesterone production in ovarian cells. The modulation of the interaction between benzodiazepine compounds and the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor by progesterone metabolites suggests new interrelationships between peripheral and central nervous system receptors sensitive to benzodiazepines.\r"

  ".W": "Previously we raised an antiserum (4BII) against nuclear T3 receptor (NT3R), which recognizes c-erb A/NT3R alpha 1 and beta, but not alpha 2. An immunohistochemical study using 4BII revealed that among the tissues examined, the cerebral cortex, anterior pituitary, and thyroid gland exhibited strong immunostaining in the nuclei. In the present study we examined the localization of NT3R proteins in individual cell types of rat anterior pituitary, using the technique of double immunostaining with 4BII and antibodies against pituitary hormones. The cryostat sections and paraffin sections of rat pituitary were incubated with 4BII at 4 C overnight. The NT3R proteins were visualized as brown in the nuclei by avidin-biotin peroxidase staining. The control sections incubated with an antiserum which had previously absorbed with c-erb A peptide or an inactive antiserum showed very poor nuclear staining under the same condition. After being washed with 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.2) for 2 h to remove 4BII, the sections were incubated with antiserum against individual anterior pituitary hormones at 4 C overnight. Using the method of alkali phosphatase/naphthol/Fast blue staining, the peptide hormones in the cytosol were stained blue. Double staining with 4BII and anti-FSH beta or anti-LH beta anti-serum clearly demonstrated that gonadotrophs contained the NT3R proteins. Similarly, the NT3R proteins in corticotrophs were demonstrated by the immunostaining with 4BII and anti-ACTH antiserum. As expected, the NT3R proteins were present in somatotrophs, thyrotrophs, and lactotrophs. On the other hand, folliculo-stellate cells, which are nonhormone secreting cells and are identified by their S-100 protein immunoreactivity, were stained by 4BII only faintly. The present study demonstrated the existence of NT3R proteins not only in somatotrophs, thyrotrophs and lactotrophs but also gonadotrophs and corticotrophs, suggesting some action of thyroid hormone through the receptor in these cells.\r"

Results from Western blotting indicated that in serum-free medium 2 nM met-hGH induced an approximately 100% increase in vinculin expression relative to that in cells maintained in serum-free medium alone. GH-elicited alterations in vinculin expression were dose dependent. GH treatment elevated levels of tubulin to a lesser extent, whereas actin expression was unaffected by GH. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that GH treatment promoted a 200% increase in vinculin synthesis on day 4 relative to that in control cells. GH had no effect on phosphorylation of vinculin in 3T3-F442A cells. Based on Northern blotting, we noted that GH induced approximately a 200% increase in levels of vinculin mRNA on day 4. GH responsiveness as well as levels of vinculin were similar in 3T3-GI-16 (a highly adipogenic subclone of the 3T3-F442A cell) and 3T3-F442A cells. The GH-dependent increase in vinculin protein expression was not observed in nonadipogenic 3T3-C2 cells, suggesting that this effect of GH was related to the program of differentiation. Interestingly, levels of vinculin in nontreated 3T3-C2 cells were approximately 10-fold lower than levels in 3T3-F442A cells. GH-mediated alterations in vinculin expression in 3T3-F442A cells were abolished by treatment with fetal bovine serum, a potent mitogen. Our data indicate that increased expression of vinculin is a component of the GH-induced portion of the adipose differentiation program.\r"

TRH levels in extracted cells rose from undetectable at 3 days to 267 +/- 22.5 fmol/well (p less than 0.01) at 21 days in culture. When AP tissue was extracted without dissociation or culture TRH was undetectable. The molar ratio of TRH/PYE27 was approximately 5:1 as predicted by the structure of PreProTRH. Extracts of cultured AP cells coeluted with TRH and PYE27 standards when subjected to HPLC analysis. Basal TRH secretion was 13.2 +/- 1.8 fmol/well/30 min at 18 days in culture; depolarizing concentrations of K+ (55 mM) caused a 2.2 fold (p less than 0.01) Ca++ dependent increase in TRH release. Immunostaining for PYE27 was found in approximately 10% of the cell population. Our results suggest that authentic ProTRH peptides are synthesized by AP cells in long term culture but not in situ. While the mechanism of activation of the PreProTRH gene needs to be elucidated we propose that TRH and/or other ProTRH derived peptides may exert paracrine effects on AP function.\r"

Recently we have specifically identified three CaM binding proteins of the gonadotrope as calcineurin, caldesmon, and spectrin. Caldesmon (identified by seven polyclonal and a monoclonal antibody, as well as by functional characteristics) appears to be a CaM-regulated, F-actin binding, protein. This 84,000 mol wt component (CaD84) is heat stable and cosediments with F-actin in the absence of Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+ (greater than 1 microM) this protein disassociates from F-actin and reassociates with calmodulin. We have prepared an antibody which blocks the caldesmon-actin interaction. In the present study, we have loaded this antibody into cells to prevent the (re-)association of caldesmon with F-actin. This treatment synergistically augments the ability of GnRH and other secretogogues (maitotoxin, phorbol myristyl acetate) to stimulate gonadotropin release from the pituitary. This finding, along with the previous observations that GnRH provokes a sufficient rise in intracellular Ca2+ to allow CaM to redistribute and bind proteins which it regulates, suggests a role for caldesmon in GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin release from the pituitary.\r"

A double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted so that the left and right lungs were ventilated independently. By alternately ventilating each lung, we could completely abolish CO2 oscillations without affecting the mean blood gas levels (withdrawal of CO2 oscillations). The CO2 oscillation was calculated from arterial pH oscillation measured by a rapidly responding intra-arterial pH electrode. Respiratory center output was monitored by use of a moving time average of the phrenic neurogram. A 3-min period of withdrawal of CO2 oscillations was bracketed by two control periods (simultaneous ventilation of lungs for 3 min) to avoid the confounding effect of the baseline drift in the respiratory center output. The amplitude of the CO2 oscillations in the control was 2.33 +/- 0.89 (SD) Torr. When the difference in the mean level of arterial PCO2 between the control and withdrawal of CO2 oscillations was minimized (-0.09 +/- 0.54 Torr; P greater than 0.25), we found negligible change in the minute phrenic activity during withdrawal of CO2 oscillations (-0.02 +/- 6.11% of the control, P greater than 0.98, n = 49; 99% confidence interval -2.36 to 2.32%). Thus we conclude that the maintenance of normal respiration at rest is not critically dependent on a phasic afferent input to the respiratory center arising from respiratory CO2 oscillations.\r"

  ".W": "Capillary CO2 exchange in vivo is affected by several interdependent reactions and transport processes. A mathematical model that includes all the significant chemical and transport events that are presumed to occur during capillary gas exchange has been used to investigate the effect of inhibition of 1) erythrocyte HCO(3-)-Cl- exchange, 2) lung carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity with access to plasma, and 3) erythrocyte CA activity on overall pulmonary CO2 excretion (VCO2) during rest and moderate exercise. Any decrement in VCO2 due to inhibition of HCO(3-)-Cl- exchange and/or CA activity, should result in compensatory alterations in cardiac output and/or an increase in the mixed venous blood-to-alveolar PCO2 gradient [(delta PCO2)V-A] to restore steady-state VCO2. Our computations show that complete inhibition of erythrocyte anion exchange would require a compensatory increment in cardiac output of approximately 30-40% or an increase in (delta PCO2)V-A from 6 to 8.3 Torr at rest and from 12 to 15.6 Torr during moderate exercise, if lung CA activity is intact. In the absence of availability of lung CA activity to plasma, the necessary (delta PCO2)V-A is 10.5 Torr at rest and 19.5 Torr during moderate exercise. Complete inhibition of lung and erythrocyte CA activity is predicted to require (delta PCO2)V-A of 39.1 Torr at rest and 74.2 Torr during moderate exercise. These results suggest that HCO(3-)-Cl- exchange might not be vital to maintenance of CO2 transfer and perhaps has a more important role in minimizing the changes in plasma pH associated with microvascular gas exchange in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The role of umbilical cord occlusion in the initiation of breathing at birth was investigated by use of 16 unanesthetized fetal sheep near full term. Artificial ventilation with high-frequency oscillation was used to control fetal arterial blood gas tensions. At baseline, PCO2 was maintained at control fetal values and PO2 was elevated to between 25 and 50 Torr. In the first study on six intact and four vagotomized fetuses, arterial PCO2 and PO2 were maintained constant during two 30-min periods of umbilical cord occlusion. Nevertheless, the mean fetal breathing rate increased significantly when the umbilical cord was occluded. In the second study on six intact fetuses, hypercapnia (68 Torr) was imposed by adding CO2 to the ventilation gas. When the umbilical cord was occluded, there was a significantly greater stimulation of breathing (rate, incidence, and amplitude) in response to hypercapnia than in response to hypercapnia alone. During cord occlusion, plasma prostaglandin E2 concentration decreased significantly. Results indicate that cord occlusion stimulates breathing possibly by causing the removal of a placentally produced respiratory inhibitor such as prostaglandin E2 from the circulation.\r"

In this intact animal model, HPV was defined as the gradient between hypoxic and hyperoxic transmural (tm) mean pulmonary arterial pressure [Ppa(tm)] at any level of cardiac index (Q). Ppa(tm)/Q plots were constructed with mean transmural left atrial pressure [Pla(tm)] kept constant at approximately 6 mmHg (n = 5 dogs), and Ppa(tm)/PEEP plots were constructed with Q kept constant approximately 2.8 l.min-1.m-2 and Pla(tm) kept constant approximately 8 mmHg (n = 8 dogs). Q was manipulated using a femoral arteriovenous bypass and a balloon catheter in the inferior vena cava. Pla(tm) was held constant by a balloon catheter placed by left thoracotomy in the left atrium. Increasing PEEP, from 0 to 12 Torr by 2-Torr increments, at constant Q and Pla(tm), increased Ppa(tm) from 14 +/- 1 (SE) to 19 +/- 1 mmHg in hyperoxia but did not affect Ppa(tm) (from 22 +/- 2 to 23 +/- 1 mmHg) in hypoxia. Both hypoxia and PEEP, at constant Pla(tm), increased Ppa(tm) over the whole range of Q studied, from 1 to 5 l/min, but more at the highest than at the lowest Q and without change in extrapolated pressure intercepts. Adding PEEP to hypoxia did not affect Ppa(tm) at all levels of Q.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Investigation into the efficacy of open cardiac procedures in-utero will require techniques for safe and effective fetal extracorporeal circulation and myocardial protection. We performed cardiopulmonary bypass in 8 fetal lambs to assess the feasibility of fetal cardiopulmonary bypass. Four fetuses underwent studies at 37 degrees C (Group I) and 4 at 25 degrees C (Group II). The aorta was clamped and cold crystalloid cardioplegia administered. Perfusion was carried out for 10 minutes each at high (95 +/- 18 cc/kg/min), moderate (67 +/- 10 cc/kg/min), and low (49 +/- 8 cc/kg/min) flow rates while hemodynamic and blood gas measurements were made. Total time on bypass averaged 57 min in Group I and 75 min in Group II. Four fetuses were successfully weaned from bypass following the study period. Fetal pO2 and oxygen saturation was very low at all flow rates in Group II and at low flow rates in Group I, indicating poor function of the placenta as an oxygenator at 25 degrees C and at low flow rates during normothermia. Lambs undergoing bypass at 37 degrees C had a progressive rise in pCO2 levels as flow decreased, while pCO2 was relatively normal at all flow rates at 25 degrees C. These studies serve as a starting point for the development of techniques to allow intrauterine correction of experimentally produced fetal cardiac lesions.\r"

Purified toxin A was radiolabeled using a modified Bolton-Hunter method to sp act 2 microCi/micrograms, with retention of full biologic activity. 3H-Toxin A bound specifically to a single class of receptors on rabbit BB and on RBL cells with dissociation constants of 5.4 x 10(-8) and 3.5 x 10(-8) M, respectively. RBL cells were highly sensitive to toxin A (cell rounding) and had 180,000 specific binding sites per cell, whereas IMR-90 fibroblasts were far less sensitive to toxin A and lacked detectable specific binding sites. Exposure of BB to trypsin or chymotrypsin significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Preincubation of BB with Bandeirea simplicifolia (BS-1) lectin also reduced specific binding, and CHAPS-solubilized receptors could be immobilized with WGA-agarose. The addition of 100 nM toxin A accelerated the association of 35S-GTP gamma S with rabbit ileal BB, and preincubation of BB with the GTP analogues GTP gamma S or Gpp(NH)p, significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Our data indicate that the membrane receptor for toxin A is a galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine-containing glycoprotein which appears to be coupled to a G protein.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that urea transport across the terminal inner medullary collecting duct (terminal IMCD) is mediated by a vasopressin-stimulated, facilitated diffusion process exhibiting properties consistent with a transporter. To investigate whether hypertonic NaCl, as exists in vivo in the inner medulla, affects urea permeability, we studied isolated perfused rat terminal IMCD segments. Perfusate and bath osmolality were varied symmetrically by adding or removing NaCl or mannitol. Urea permeability rose progressively when osmolality was increased with NaCl or mannitol from 290 to 690 mOsm/kg H2O in the absence of vasopressin; there was no further increase at 890 mOsm/kg H2O. In the presence of 10(-8) M arginine vasopressin, urea permeability increased when NaCl was added to raise osmolality from 290 to 490 mOsm/kg H2O but there was no further increase at 690 mOsm/kg H2O. When 1 mM 8-bromo cyclic AMP was added to the bath, raising NaCl still increased urea permeability. These results suggest that urea transport across the rat terminal IMCD is regulated both by vasopressin and by osmolality at values present in the renal inner medulla. Osmolality seems to activate urea transport across the rat terminal IMCD by mechanisms distinct from those of vasopressin or cyclic AMP.\r"

Freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes and intestinal lymphocytes obtained by enzymatic dispersion of duodenal biopsies were assayed for numbers of total and vaccine specific immunoglobulin-secreting cells by enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) techniques; the frequency of cells secreting interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was also examined by a new modification of the ELISPOT technique. After booster immunizations with oral cholera vaccine, large numbers of cholera toxin-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) appeared in the small intestine. The responses were dominated by IgA ASC. A single immunization, performed 5 mo after the initial vaccinations, gave rise to an ASC response similar to that seen after the first booster immunization, with respect to both magnitude and isotype distribution. Each of the immunizations also evoked an ASC response in blood which was of lower magnitude than that seen in the small intestine, and comprised similar proportions of IgA and IgG ASC. A booster immunization also resulted in increased frequencies of IFN-gamma-secreting cells, but this increase was confined to the duodenal mucosa. This study establishes the feasibility of studying, at the single-cell level, intestinal immune reactivity in humans. Furthermore, it indicates that the small intestinal mucosa is an enriched source of IFN-gamma. It also demonstrates marked differences between intestinal and peripheral blood immune responses after enteric immunization, and confirms the notion that the mucosal immune system in humans displays immunological memory.\r"

  ".W": "Induction of HLA class I antigens on cultured melanoma cells FO-1 after transfection with a human or a mouse B2m gene was associated with a statistically significant reduction in their susceptibility to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis. These results indicate that the structural differences between human and mouse beta 2-mu do not abolish the ability of the HLA class I molecular complex to modulate NK cell-mediated lysis of melanoma cells FO-1. The role of HLA class I antigens in the phenomenon is corroborated by the ability of anti-HLA class I MAb to enhance, although to a different extent, the susceptibility of transfected FO-1 cells to NK cell-mediated lysis. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) significantly reduced the susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis of transfected FO-1 cells. Surprisingly, TNF-alpha reduced the extent of lysis more than IFN-gamma, although the latter cytokine enhanced HLA class I antigen expression more than the former one. This finding, in conjunction with a reduction in the susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis of untransfected FO-1 cells incubated with IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha, suggests that the two cytokines reduce NK cell-mediated lysis of transfected cells by modulating not only the expression of HLA class I antigens, but also that of other structures. Induction of HLA class I antigens and their modulation with IFN-gamma did not affect the susceptibility to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell-mediated lysis of transfected FO-1 cells. Characterization of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying abnormalities in HLA class I antigen expression by melanoma cells and of the role of these molecules in the interactions of melanoma cells with various types of effector cells may suggest novel immunotherapeutic approaches to melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "In the context of the central role of the alveolar macrophage in host defense of the respiratory epithelial surface, and the ability of IFN-gamma to activate mononuclear phagocytes, we have evaluated strategies to use rIFN-gamma to activate human alveolar macrophages in vivo. To accomplish this, rIFN-gamma was administered to nonsmoking normals, the amounts of IFN-gamma quantified in serum and respiratory epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and the status of IFN-gamma related activation of blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages was evaluated by quantifying the expression of mRNA transcripts of IP-10, a gene induced specifically by IFN-gamma. Systemic administration (subcutaneous) of maximally tolerated amounts of rIFN-gamma (250 micrograms) was followed by detectable levels of IFN-gamma in serum but not ELF, the expression of IP-10 transcripts in blood monocytes but not alveolar macrophages, and multiple systemic adverse effects. To circumvent the inability of systemic administration to reach respiratory ELF and activate alveolar macrophages, rIFN-gamma (250-1,000 micrograms) was inhaled as an aerosol once daily for 3 d. Strikingly, while IFN-gamma was not detected in serum it was detectable in respiratory ELF in a dose-dependent fashion. Further, alveolar macrophages, but not blood monocytes, expressed IP-10 mRNA transcripts and, importantly, inhalation of aerosolized rIFN-gamma was not associated with local or systemic adverse effects. Thus, it is feasible to use rIFN-gamma to activate alveolar macrophages by targeting the cytokine directly to the lung. These data suggest a potential strategy for targeted cytokine therapy, without systemic side effects, to augment respiratory tract defenses in individuals at risk for or with lung infection.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the abilities of extracellular ATP (acting via P2-purinergic receptors) and formylated peptides (FMLP) to stimulate both phospholipase D (PLD)-based signal transduction and primary granule (azurophilic) secretion in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway. In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, neither ATP nor FMLP elicited significant PLD activation or increased secretion despite the previously documented ability of ATP to stimulate large increases in polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization. Conversely, within 1 d after induction of granulocytic differentiation by dibutyryl cAMP, both ATP and FMLP induced large increases in azurophilic secretion and corresponding increases in PLD activity. ATP-activated PLD activity was near-maximal within 1 d after dibutyryl cAMP treatment, while the FMLP-induced activity increased continuously over 4 d, with a maximal level twice that stimulated by ATP. Additional experiments characterized the activation of PLD by receptor-independent pathways at different stages of differentiation; these included studies of phorbol ester action in intact cells and GTP gamma S action in electropermeabilized cells. An apparent role for guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins in PLD regulation was also indicated by the significant reduction in FMLP- and ATP-stimulated PLD activity observed in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. At all stages of differentiation, there was good correlation between the relative efficacies of ATP versus FMLP in stimulating both secretion and PLD activity. These data indicate: (a) that the receptor-regulated phospholipase D signaling pathway is induced during differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells; and (b) that differential activation of this signaling system by various Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptor agonists may underlie the differential regulation of secretion and other phagocyte functions by such agents.\r"

Keratinocytes constititively express IL-1 mRNA when cultured in keratinocyte growth medium but not in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing fetal bovine serum, in which the cells differentiate. The predominant form of IL-1 expressed by keratinocytes is IL-1 alpha. Addition of IL-1 alpha to keratinocytes increased IL-1 alpha and TGF alpha mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. TGF alpha induced a similar increase in IL-1 alpha and TGF alpha mRNA in keratinocytes. Hydrocortisone decreased the expression of both IL-1 alpha and TGF alpha mRNA in keratinocytes. These findings document an autocrine mechanism by which IL-1 alpha and TGF alpha can stimulate the proliferation of keratinocytes in the skin. It is proposed that this autocrine loop may be hyperactive in psoriasis. Antagonism of the effects of this autocrine loop may be one of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids exert clinically useful effects in psoriasis and other diseases of the skin.\r"

However, bactericidal activity was significantly lower in 4-day culture-derived macrophages compared with matched monocyte cultures. The addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to monocytes was found to inhibit the bactericidal activity of fresh monocytes. The number of bacteria recovered from fresh monocytes exposed to IFN-gamma was significantly higher than that in control cultures with MAC alone, suggesting that intracellular MAC growth could be stimulated by IFN-gamma. This enhancement of MAC survival and growth by IFN-gamma was not observed when culture-derived macrophages were used. Similar results were obtained with IFN-alpha/A2. These results indicate, therefore, that the innate efficiency of mycobacterial killing by monocytes can be down-regulated by IFN, but macrophages are not significantly affected.\r"

Significant increases in CD8+ cells, particularly those bearing activation CD8+CD38+ and CD8+Ia+ antigens, and marked reductions in CD4+ cells were detected in WB-PCR+ subjects compared with 33 WB-PCR- homosexuals. WB-PCR+ subjects had impaired B cell but not T cell functions. Immunologic characteristics of WB-PCR+ homosexuals were indistinguishable from those of 17 WB+PCR+ subjects. Subjects progressing from WB-PCR- to WB-PCR+ to WB+PCR+ showed sequential phenotypic and functional alterations in their B and T cell compartments. These changes and the presence of HIV-1 genomic sequences were the first indications of HIV-1 infection and together with p24 antigenemia signified an inevitable progression to AIDS.\r"

Organisms in freshly passed stool specimens showed an internal morula of lipid-containing globules. In fresh water, the morula divided into two sausage-shaped structures resembling the sporocysts of an isosporid coccidian. After 7 months, the organisms had not developed the crescentic sporozoites seen in the Coccidia but had begun to multiply slowly in culture. It was impossible to stain the internal structures of the organisms because the outer cyst wall ruptured during desiccation, releasing the contents of the cysts. The organisms were readily identified by their intense blue autofluorescence under UV light, but they were also recognizable by bright-field microscopy and by a modified acid-fast stain. Almost all infected persons suffered intermittent diarrhea for 2-3 weeks and many emphasized a feeling of intense fatigue during the course of their illness.\r"

The spleens of infected animals contained lower levels of infectivity, PrP, and SAF than did brains. Regardless of the route of infection, both SAF and infectivity were detected in spleen before brain. Infectivity increased in brains and spleens of 139A-infected mice before the detection and increase in SAF, suggesting that the synthesis of SAF and PrP may not be the limiting factor in agent replication. In contrast to those in ME7- and 263K-infected animals, the Western blot profiles for PrP from brain and spleen of 139A-infected mice exhibited distinct differences. Results indicate that SAF and PrP found in the spleens are both organ- and scrapie strain-specific.\r"

Mean neutropenia-inducing doses of interferon-alpha were 9.4 x 10(6) and 10.6 x 10(6) IU/day for groups receiving 100 or 200 mg zidovudine every 4 h, respectively. Mean GM-CSF doses used to reverse neutropenia were 0.64 and 0.63 microgram/kg/day for these two groups, respectively, although the mean minimum effective GM-CSF dose for both was only 0.30 microgram/kg/day. Serum p24 antigen declined greater than 70% in all 5 antigenemic patients. Toxicities included a dose-dependent increase in lymphokine-like side effects (100%), anorexia and weight loss (42%), fatigue (42%), and anemia (50%). While toxicities of the combination can be significant, low-dose GM-CSF readily ameliorated neutropenia associated with zidovudine and interferon-alpha therapy without adversely affecting the antiviral properties of the combination.\r"

In contrast to adults, each of five children infected with HIV-1 in utero or during the perinatal period were plasma viremic regardless of their CD4+ lymphocytes counts (range, 42-2227/mm3), duration of infection, or clinical stage; however, children infected by HIV-1 at older ages were less frequently plasma viremic. Therapy with zidovudine led to a 10- to 10(6)-fold decline in plasma HIV-1 TCID in all eight subjects studied before and after treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The effect on interictal electroencephalographic epileptic activity of intravenous flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), a benzodiazepine antagonist and potential antiepileptic drug, was studied in 10 patients. Comparison was made with intravenous diazepam (10 mg) and placebo using a single-blind, single-dose, cross-over design. A dose of 3 mg flumazenil was well tolerated and produced a significantly greater reduction in the number of epileptic transients during the first 40 minutes after injection than did placebo (p less than 0.05). This effect was similar to that of diazepam in magnitude and duration. When flumazenil (3 mg) was administered immediately after intravenous diazepam (10 mg), the reduction in interictal epileptic activity was not significantly different from that produced by diazepam alone. The results suggest that either flumazenil has intrinsic antiepileptic activity and in this respect acts as a partial agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, or that it is antagonising an endogenous proconvulsant ligand in these patients.\r"

Evaluations from both a clinical and a neuroradiological point of view were made of the CNS functions of 12 unselected Western children affected by CMD. In five patients, clinical observation and intelligence tests showed a mild to severe mental retardation. One of these patients suffered also from a severe form of epilepsy. In the same five patients, various degrees of white matter hypodensity, ventricular enlargement and cerebral atrophy were also detected. Similar neuroradiological abnormalities were also found in five of the seven children who did not have clinical symptoms or signs of CNS involvement. In one of these cases, necropsy neuropathological examination showed the gyral anomalies characteristic of the Japanese type of CMD. This study clearly indicates the high frequency of subclinical CNS alterations in typical Western CMD, suggesting that it should be considered a type of myoencephalopathy like its Japanese counterpart.\r"

These septic responses have been linked to increased alveolar-capillary membrane (ACM) permeability. This study was designed to establish whether delayed ibuprofen treatment would have the same effect and to examine the relationship between PMN oxidant generation and TNF. Three groups of anesthetized, ventilated pigs (15-25 kg) were used. Group Ps received Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 x 10(8) CFU/mL at 0.3 mL/20 kg/min) for one hour IV; The control group (Con) received 0.9% NaCl. Group D-Ibu received ibuprofen 12.5 mg/kg as a delayed bolus at 30 minutes and again at 120 minutes after Ps. Protein (BAL-P, microgram/mL) in harvested bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and extravascular lung water (EVLW, mL/kg) were used to estimate the integrity of the ACM. Superoxide anion (O2-) generation (ferricytochrome c reduction) from circulating PMNs and plasma TNF activity (L929 fibroblast bioassay) were measured. The EVLW increased significantly (p less than 0.05), as did BAL-P (p less than 0.01), in the P. aeruginosa-treated animals at 300 minutes. These increases were abolished in Group D-Ibu: EVLW, 6.6 +/- 1.0 baseline vs. 14.6 +/- 2.6 Ps 300 vs. 6.8 +/- 0.9 D-Ibu 300; BAL-P, 175 +/- 28 baseline vs. 984 +/- 186 Ps 300 vs. 284 +/- 42.8 D-Ibu 300. Both enhanced PMN oxidant activity and increased plasma TNF activity were significantly attenuated by delayed ibuprofen treatment. These data support the efficacy of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, when used after the onset of a septic stimulus.\r"

Using an established model of hind limb ischemia, reproducible lung injury occurred after reperfusion. Lung microvascular permeability was measured with 125I-BSA and increased two-fold after 30 minutes of reperfusion. Pulmonary injury was blocked with DMSO, DMTU, allopurinol, indomethacin, and SOD plus catalase. The degree of pulmonary neutrophil sequestration as assessed by tissue myeloperoxidase activity was significantly diminished in animals pretreated with antioxidants. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not attenuate the neutrophil sequestration within the pulmonary parenchyma. These data suggest that increased lung microvascular permeability and neutrophil accumulation occur following hind limb ischemia/reperfusion. Therapeutic interventions with oxygen radical inhibitors blocked this process, while the prostaglandin inhibitor, indomethacin, only reduced lung permeability.\r"

The application sites were the penile shaft (nitroglycerin) or glans penis (minoxidil and placebo). Increases in diameter and rigidity were measured with the RigiScan device and arterial flow was evaluated by conventional Doppler sonography. Side effects were considered as well. This drug proved to be more active than nitroglycerin and placebo in increasing diameter, rigidity and arterial flow of the penis. The highest activity proved to occur in neurogenically impotent patients. Fewer side effects also were found with minoxidil than with nitroglycerin. For these reasons minoxidil is proposed as a long-term therapeutic agent for organic impotence.\r"

Anti-HCV detected in 7 infants cleared by 9 months and remained undetectable thereafter. Serum alanine aminotransferase was raised in 3 infants.

  ".W": "We compared physiological and perceptual responses to non-weight bearing (cycle) and weight bearing (treadmill) exercise in 16 sedentary women throughout a normal term pregnancy. Subjects were recruited late in the first trimester (less than 13 wk gestation) and were studied at 4 wk intervals throughout pregnancy and 4 wk postpartum (PP). Exercise consisted of four 5 min protocols; two were performed on the cycle (C1 = 50 W; C2 = 75 W) and two on the treadmill (T1 = 66 m.min-1, 2.5% grade; T2 = 66 m.min-1, 12% grade). Measured variables included oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate (HR), minute ventilation (VE), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE, 10-point Borg scale). Absolute VO2 (ml.min-1) during cycle exercise increased (P less than 0.001) by 25 wk gestation, while relative VO2 (ml.kg-1.min-1) during treadmill walking was unchanged through late pregnancy and PP. This suggests that cycle exercise is not a true non-weight bearing exercise within a given group of women throughout gestation. Subjects' VO2max values were estimated at each test interval and found to increase (P less than 0.001) by 25-28 wk gestation. Heart rate and RPE responses to exercise remained constant throughout gestation and decreased (P less than 0.01) PP. Although they did not participate in a regular exercise program, it appears that our subjects experienced a mild aerobic training effect during late pregnancy.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether walking at the PSF and FDHO leads to minimal metabolic and mechanical costs. Subjects walked on a level treadmill at the PSF, FDHO, and frequencies above and below. Effects of stride length (SL) and speed (S) were assessed by two conditions, one in which SL was constant and the other in which S was constant. The predictability of PSF from resonance was replicated. Walking at the PSF and FDHO frequencies resulted in metabolic costs which were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05). A U-shaped oxygen consumption curve was observed with the minimum at the PSF and FDHO conditions when S was constant. A two-component curve in which a breakpoint was observed was found in the SL constant condition. A significant increase in metabolic cost was observed above the PSF/FDHO (P less than 0.01). Internal work (power) values were not significantly different between walking frequencies for the S constant condition. In the SL constant condition, internal work values showed linear increases as frequency increased. It was concluded that PSF of walking arises from the interface of the resonance properties of the limbs as oscillators and the tendency of biological systems to self-optimize.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases, including Graves' disease and Hashimoto's disease, have marked lymphocytic infiltration in their thyroid glands. We examined the gene for the variable regions of the alpha-chain of the human T-cell receptor (the V alpha gene) in intrathyroidal T cells to determine whether the infiltration is a secondary heterogeneous immune response or a more restricted, and therefore primary and presumably pathogenetic, reaction to thyroid autoantigens. METHODS. We used the polymerase chain reaction to detect small numbers of T cells expressing the variable region of the V alpha gene. Different oligonucleotides were used to amplify complementary DNA for the 18 known families of the V alpha gene in intrathyroidal T cells from 9 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. We compared the findings with the results in patients with nonautoimmune thyroid disease as well as those in normal subjects. RESULTS. We found marked restriction in the expression of T-cell-receptor V alpha genes by T cells from the thyroid tissue of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. An average of only 5 of the 18 V alpha genes were expressed in such samples, as compared with 17 V alpha genes expressed in peripheral-blood T cells from the same patients. No such restriction was found in thyroid tissue from patients with nonautoimmune thyroid disease. The predominantly expressed V alpha genes differed from patient to patient, however, with no clear association with the type of disease. CONCLUSIONS. Intrathyroidal T-cell accumulation in autoimmune thyroid disease is highly restricted and points to the primacy of T cells in causing thyroid disorders. These results present the possibility of using antibodies to the T-cell receptor for the specific inhibition of abnormal T-cell function in autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

The most highly contaminated are calcium and phosphate salts, followed by albumin and heparin. Parenteral administration of aluminum bypasses the gastrointestinal tract, which serves as a protective barrier to aluminum entry into the blood. In the past, parenteral administration of aluminum as a contaminant of water used in hemodialysis and of casein hydrolysate, the former source of protein in parenteral nutrition solutions, was associated with a low-turnover osteomalacic bone disease and, in the case of uremic patients, encephalopathy. Groups currently at risk for aluminum accumulation in tissue resulting from parenteral administration include premature infants receiving long-term parenteral nutrition and patients receiving plasmapheresis therapy with albumin. Both groups may develop metabolic bone disease; the pathogenesis may involve aluminum. The Food and Drug Administration is currently considering regulation of aluminum in fluids used for parenteral nutrition. No changes are presently proposed with regard to albumin.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of a human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG, Gefilac) on recovery from acute diarrhea (82% rotavirus), 71 well-nourished children between 4 and 45 months of age were studied. After oral rehydration, the patients randomly received either Lactobacillus GG-fermented milk product, 125 g (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 1); Lactobacillus GG freeze-dried powder, one dose (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 2); or a placebo, a pasteurized yogurt (group 3) 125 g twice daily; each diet was given for 5 days, in addition to normal full diet otherwise free of fermented dairy products. The mean (SD) duration of diarrhea after commencing the therapy was significantly shorter in group 1 (1.4 [0.8] days) and in group 2 (1.4 [0.8] days) than in group 3 (2.4 [1.1] days); F = 8.70, P less than 0.001. After rehydration, each dietary group maintained a positive weight trend. The urinary lactulose-mannitol recovery ratios (means [95% confidence intervals]) on admission were 0.09 (0.03, 0.24) in group 1, 0.12 (0.07, 0.22) in group 2, and 0.08 (0.04, 0.18) in group 3; no significant alterations in intestinal permeability were observed at retesting after 2 days of realimentation. The result indicates that early nutritional repletion after rehydration causes no mucosal disruption and is beneficial for recovery from diarrhea. It is further suggested that Lactobacillus GG in the form of fermented milk or freeze-dried powder is effective in shortening the course of acute diarrhea.\r"

The goal of this study was to examine the effects of changes in diameter of the basilar artery on blood flow to the brain stem. We measured blood flow with laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized rats. The topical application of 10(-6) M serotonin, which selectively constricts large arteries, reduced diameter of the basilar artery by 47 +/- 5% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) but did not alter blood flow to the ventral brain stem (change in blood flow -2 +/- 5%). The topical application of 10(-8) M vasopressin, which affects both large and small vessels, decreased blood flow by 33 +/- 4% (n = 6). In rats with spontaneous vasomotion, the basilar artery showed rhythmic changes in diameter at a frequency of 4.0 +/- 0.1 cycles/min and an amplitude of 20 +/- 1% of mean diameter (n = 6). Blood flow to the ventral brain stem cycled at the same frequency as and in phase with changes in diameter of the basilar artery, with an amplitude of 15 +/- 1%. We conclude that constriction of the basilar artery may occur with no change in brain stem perfusion. The distinct changes in blood flow during spontaneous vasomotion suggest that vasomotion occurs in intraparenchymal arterioles as well as in the basilar artery.\r"

We previously demonstrated that blood placed on the adventitial surface of cerebral arteries enhances intimal platelet accumulation, positively correlating with endothelial damage and other pathologic changes in vessel walls. In this study, we investigated the ability of a single bolus injection of tissue plasminogen activator to prevent platelet accumulation in cerebral vessels after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was produced in cats by the transorbital intracisternal injection of 2.5 ml autologous arterial blood around the proximal part of the right middle cerebral artery. In 10 animals, 25 micrograms tissue plasminogen activator was injected at intervals of 10 (five cats) and 60 minutes (five cats) after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracisternal physiological saline (0.5 ml) was injected in six cats 10 minutes after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Platelets labeled with indium-111 were injected intravenously just before subarachnoid hemorrhage, and their radioactivity was measured in cerebral arteries at death. The results indicated that, after subarachnoid hemorrhage, early injection of tissue plasminogen activator inhibited intimal platelet accumulation, but later injection did not, although the extent of subarachnoid clot was reduced at both plasminogen injection times.\r"

Rats were anesthetized with 1.4% isoflurane in air, and ischemia was produced by unilateral carotid artery ligation combined with hemorrhagic hypotension to 30 mm Hg for 30 minutes. Intracarotid (n = 10) or intravenous (n = 10) saline infusion (0.3 ml/min) decreased hematocrit 20% compared with control rats (n = 10). Neurological outcome was significantly improved in rats infused with intracarotid (p less than 0.05) but not intravenous saline during ischemia without a change in brain temperature. Cerebral blood flow, measured in a separate study using laser Doppler flowmetry (n = 5), decreased 70% (p less than 0.01) during carotid ligation and hypotension but was not changed by intracarotid saline infusion (p greater than 0.30). These results show that perfusion of ischemic brain with saline improves outcome by factors not related to changes in hematocrit, brain temperature, or intraischemic tissue blood flow.\r"

Mean fluid output was similar between the two groups. Pharmacist interventions can significantly decrease intake and result in a better fluid balance in fluid-restricted ICU patients who require PN.\r"
