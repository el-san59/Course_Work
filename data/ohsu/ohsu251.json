The mean length of follow-up was 11.9 +/- 10.8 months. Before the implantation, the patients had survived one or more cardiac arrests (mean, 1.7; range, 1 to 4) and episodes of syncope (mean, 2.2; range, 2 to 3) and had received 6.0 +/- 1.0 antiarrhythmic drug trials. The in-hospital complications included death (two patients), reoperation (one patient), intraoperative myocardial infarction (one patient), sensing-failure (one patient), infection (five patients), and pocket seroma (two patients). The posthospital complications included device failure (four patients), device deactivation (one patient), and inappropriate discharge (two patients). The device discharged appropriately in seven patients due to sustained ventricular tachycardia. During electrophysiologic measurements, the energy requirement for successful cardioversion-defibrillation was related to the type of ventricular arrhythmia induced (monomorphic or pleomorphic ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation). Ventricular tachycardia acceleration occurred in ten patients (40%). No significant changes were found in the size of the electrograms or in the cardioversion threshold during early and late follow-up measurements. Life table analysis showed a 12-month survival rate of 86% and an arrhythmic death survival rate of 100%. We confirm the improved rate of survival in this high-risk group of patients, despite significant complications.\r"

This report examines the rates of dysfunction among the 52 probands and 80 control adolescents who did not receive a DSM-III diagnosis at follow-up. Contrary to expectations, there were few areas (primarily involving school adjustment) in which the formerly hyperactive children were found to be at a disadvantage and numerous areas (occupational adjustment, temperament, alcohol abuse, antisocial activities, etc) in which the groups were indistinguishable. The results are explained in accordance with a bimodal distribution of dysfunction in hyperactive children grown up. Indirectly, this model supports the construct validity of the DSM-III diagnoses attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, substance use disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Post hoc analyses suggest that behavior problems resulting from drug use in early adolescence have graver consequences for previously hyperactive children than normal subjects.\r"

In addition to mental retardation, hemizygous males with fragile X syndrome appear to have a greater likelihood of displaying behaviors classified under the diagnostic category of pervasive developmental disorder than would be expected on the basis of mental retardation alone. Although the majority of female heterozygotes with the fragile X genetic defect are of normal intelligence, our clinical work with this population and a recent case report have suggested that females with fragile X syndrome have an increased rate of schizophrenia spectrum and affective disorders. In this study, the relationship of the fragile X genetic defect to psychopathology in female heterozygotes is investigated by psychiatric evaluation of 35 obligate female carriers of the fragile X chromosome and a comparison group of 24 fragile X-negative controls. Female fragile X carriers were found to have a greater frequency of psychopathology associated with schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses, particularly schizotypal features. A weaker association between the fragile X genetic defect and chronic affective disorders was detected. The specificity of the neuropsychiatric phenotype occurring in particular genetic conditions such as the fragile X syndrome adds a potentially valuable tool to the study of psychopathology in the general population.\r"

Lactate infusion doubled cardiac output, increased blood lactate levels by sixfold, and produced hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and decreased serum bicarbonate levels in both groups but raised arterial pressure only in the patients. The patients hyperventilated before and during the infusion. Physiological responses and somatic complaints with the infusion differed little between the groups, but emotional complaints were six times more frequent among the panic patients. Eight patients but no control subjects interpreted their symptoms as a panic attack. Heart rate increased with only 14 of 31 recorded spontaneous outpatient panic attacks. Sodium lactate infusions appear to produce panic by mimicking the physiology of spontaneous panic. Treatment with cardioactive agents is not indicated in the absence of cardiopulmonary or autonomic nervous system abnormalities.\r"

There were significant diurnal variations in both MHPG and HVA concentrations on the baseline day, whereas on the constant routine, a diurnal variation was present only in HVA. We conclude that diurnal variations in plasma MHPG are evoked by changes in physical activity, posture, or other factors controlled on the constant routine, and that a major component of the diurnal variation in plasma HVA concentrations is regulated by a circadian oscillator that is independent of sleep or activity.\r"

Baseline prolactin levels and the prolactin rise following MCPP were significantly reduced in female patients compared with female healthy subjects. In contrast, the increase in prolactin level following tryptophan administration was not significantly different between male or female patients with OCD and the respective sex-matched healthy subjects. The prolactin responses to MCPP and tryptophan were both significantly higher in female patients and healthy subjects than in their male counterparts. The cortisol and growth hormone responses to MCPP and tryptophan were similar in the patients and healthy subjects and were not related to gender. The behavioral responses to MCPP or tryptophan were not consistently different between patients and healthy subjects, and neither MCPP nor tryptophan had effects on obsessive or compulsive symptoms. These results lend only partial support to the hypothesis that 5-HT dysfunction may be linked to the pathophysiology of OCD and point to the need for the evaluation of other neurotransmitter systems in future investigations of OCD.\r"

  ".W": "In the context of a Finnish birth cohort, we tested the hypothesis that viral infection during the latter two thirds of fetal development would increase the risk of adult schizophrenic outcome. Psychiatric hospital diagnoses were recorded for all individuals in greater Helsinki who were fetuses during the 1957 type A2 influenza epidemic. Those exposed to the viral epidemic during their second trimester of fetal development were at elevated risk of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This was true for both males and females and independently in several psychiatric hospitals. The second-trimester effect was seen in the elevated proportion of schizophrenics among those admitted to a psychiatric hospital and also in higher rates of schizophrenia per 1000 live births in the city of Helsinki. The study has several limitations: (1) We have no direct evidence that the subjects actually suffered a viral infection. (2) The psychiatric data were obtained only for subjects up to the age of 26 years, 56 days. (3) The findings are based on hospital diagnoses. (4) The determination of stage of gestation at time of exposure to the epidemic is based on date of birth. The viral infection might have occurred outside the official epidemic window; the infant may have had a preterm or postterm delivery. These sources of error, however, should not serve to enhance the findings. The observed viral effect is interpreted as being one of many potential perturbations of gestation. We suggest that it is less the type than the timing of the disturbance during fetal neural development that is critical in determining risk for schizophrenia.\r"

Thyroglobulin was positive in the follicular cells and/or colloid of all lesions (except medullary carcinoma) and two papillary carcinomas. Vimentin was positive in papillary carcinoma (17 of 25), follicular carcinoma (four of nine), follicular adenoma (four of nine), and nodular goiter (two of nine). Vimentin positivity, which was restricted to follicular cells, was strongest in those cells undergoing oncocytic transformation. Three markers of glandular/acinar secretory differentiation (lactoferrin, lactalbumin, and secretory component) were uniformly negative even in well differentiated follicular structures. In medullary carcinoma, both calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen were strongly positive in the parafollicular cells. The antibody panel can definitely identify histogenesis from the thyroid but is of little value in tumor classification. In histologic and cytologic preparations, vimentin positivity does not exclude thyroid follicular cell origin. The method can be successfully applied to richly cellular needle aspirates. This is best achieved with assisted needle aspirations when cellularity is ascertained by on-site microscopic examination of multiple passes.\r"

We describe two patients who had malignant tumors arising in the liver. These tumors demonstrated cytologic, histologic, and ultrastructural features typical of malignant rhabdoid tumor. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells from both patients expressed the epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and vimentin and cells from one patient contained alpha 1-antitrypsin. Neither patient had evidence of renal involvement at autopsy. Thus, we demonstrate that this rapidly fatal tumor contains cells showing features of epithelial differentiation, and that it may occur as a primary hepatic tumor.\r"

A tumor recurrence was found attached to the stomach with invasion through the wall of the splenic flexure of the colon. The histologic features of the tumor had not significantly altered, except for a slight increase in mitotic rate. Neither the original tumor nor the recurrence exhibited smooth-muscle differentiation on ultrastructural or immunohistochemical examination, suggesting an origin from an undifferentiated or primitive mesenchymal cell. The term leiomyoblastoma, although established in the literature, should be reserved for epithelioid tumors in which myoid differentiation can be established. The long interval to recurrence supports the suggestion that all of these tumors have at least a low-grade malignant potential.\r"

Three clinical groups were identified: group A included 11 patients exhibiting a fulminant course following P cepacia colonization; group B included 20 patients who declined slowly following colonization; and group C included nine patients without P cepacia colonization. Acute pneumonia occurred in all groups but was most extensive and necrotizing in group A. Chronic lobular pneumonia involved all groups equally, whereas interstitial pneumonia predominated in group B. Diffuse alveolar damage occurred infrequently in all groups. Combinations of structural patterns were frequently seen. We conclude that, although there is great overlap in the structural appearance of pneumonia among patients with CF with different bacterial colonization histories, the evidence suggests that P cepacia is a cause of necrotizing pneumonia in some patients. Factors that predispose to this fulminant lung infection are poorly understood.\r"

In 4% of the cases, mainly stillbirths, the cause of death was unclear. Of the congenital anomalies, the cardiovascular system was most affected (57%). Hyaline membrane disease and intraventricular hemorrhage, usually frequent in series involving many preterm patients, were seldom seen. This study emphasizes the different pathologic spectrum of mortality between premature and term newborns.\r"

Of the 31 treated patients, eighteen (86%) presented good results with satisfactory recovery of anal incontinence, and three subjects (14%) showed unsatisfactory results (more than one episode of incontinence monthly). Although both groups of patients showed improvement in external anal sphincter contraction, the sensibility of the rectum to endoluminal distention improved more in good responders. The employment of biofeedback training to obtain improvement of the threshold of rectal sensibility (minimal volume of endoluminal distention to produce the sensation of imminent defecation and external anal sphincter contraction) has proved useful in the rehabilitation of incontinent patients.\r"

She made a complete recovery from her stroke within four months; however, she continued to experience decreased sensation in the right posterior thigh. Normal sural and peroneal nerve latencies, velocities, and amplitudes were obtained in the right leg. Electromyographic examination of right leg and related para spinal musculature was unremarkable. SSEP were then performed with CZ'-FZ (10-20 system) electrode placement. Normal sural, lateral femoral cutaneous, and posterior tibial responses were obtained bilaterally. Response differences consistent with an isolated right PFCN neuropathy were observed. The perfectly symmetric SSEP responses for the sural, lateral femoral cutaneous, and posterior tibial nerves obviate a central, and substantiate a peripheral, cause for the altered right PFCN evoked response.\r"

The clinical and electromyographic findings were consistent with this diagnosis. The nerve injury was believed to result from stretching at the bony obturator foramen. Management included a trial of steroids, gait training, and instruction on avoiding acute hp flexion. The clinical and EMG abnormalities disappeared. Awareness of this occurrence and an understanding of the anatomy may avoid confusion with other conditions and permit accurate diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "The rehabilitative course for patients who have suffered vertebral-basilar vascular lesions is often interrupted by intermittent episodes of increasing dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and ataxia. Since CT studies of the brain do not always visualize these lesions reliably, the rehabilitation specialist has been without a diagnostic tool to distinguish between progressive and stable vertebral-basilar system infarctions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a safe, noninvasive, sensitive means of monitoring vascular lesions in the posterior fossa. The purpose of this study was to use MRI to evaluate patients with suspected vertebral-basilar vascular lesions. In three patients studied, MRI was superior to CT scan. Advantages of MRI included lack of artifact due to bone scattering from ionizing radiation, ability to image directly in the sagittal plane, visualization and localization of pathologically smaller lesions, and potential for performing serial studies without exposing patients to large doses of radiation. In each case, MRI data yielded valuable adjunctive information that aided further rehabilitation evaluation and management. We conclude that MRI may be a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool in evaluating and managing rehabilitation patients with vascular lesions involving the vertebral-basilar system.\r"

  ".W": "In 1986 the Board of Governors of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation commissioned a survey of the Academy's membership to determine the practice patterns of physiatrists. Responses were received from 1,115 members (75%). Approximately 65% of respondents are under 43 years old; 64% are graduates of American medical schools. Fifty-six percent practice in communities with populations of 500,000 or more persons; only 9% practice in communities of less than 50,000 people. Nearly 53% practice in a single setting and the average work week is 50.6 hours, with most of those hours spent in some aspect of patient care. The most frequent diagnosis in all practice settings is pain syndrome; consultation is the primary activity. Survey results show that physiatry is still primarily a hospital-based specialty, although significant time is spent in office-based settings. Data gleaned from this first attempt at an extensive analysis of physiatric practice characteristics will be utilized in planning how to meet future needs of the specialty, its practitioners and their patients.\r"

Two fundamentally different techniques for this procedure have evolved. The first, following the method of Hall, uses a retrograde valvulotome passed from the distal saphenous vein to the proximal vein; on withdrawal, it severs the valves. A second approach, that of Leather, uses microscissors and a right-angle valvulotome, along with a disposable valve stripper, to disrupt the valves. Proponents exist for both approaches. In 1983 we reported our protocol for in situ grafting using the Hall technique. A number of modifications have since been made to expedite the technique. We describe and provide illustrations of these modifications.\r"

Statistical assessment developed a model that demonstrated that the clinical assessment of tumor status, the serum albumin level, and the nutrition score were variables significantly associated with postoperative survival. The amount of residual ovarian cancer at the completion of bowel obstruction surgery was also significantly associated with postoperative survival. This information may aid in the preoperative selection of patients who might benefit from surgical correction of intestinal obstruction.\r"

They also had more extensive disease and a greater degree of peripheral lymphopenia. Follow-up showed a trend toward greater recurrence rate in the patients with granulomas.

  ".W": "A delayed effect of fentanyl used for anesthesia may be respiratory distress several hours after surgery. The findings are muscular rigidity, fall in chest wall compliance, hypoventilation, respiratory acidosis, and hypotension. In the past, to our knowledge, this complication was exclusively reported in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, when large fentanyl dosages are employed. This article describes three general surgical patients in whom respiratory distress developed three to five hours following colon surgery when a moderate dose of fentanyl citrate, 55 to 75 micrograms/kg, was used. Initially, all patients had a normal recovery from anesthesia. Later, respiratory distress was successfully treated with a fentanyl antagonist and ventilatory assistance. This delayed toxic phenomenon is thought to be due to the reentry of fentanyl into plasma from deposits in adipose tissue, muscle, and the gastrointestinal tract, leading to a secondary rise in the plasma concentration. It is more likely to be encountered when hypothermia, rewarming, and acidosis are present in the postoperative period. This life-threatening complication is treacherous, since it may occur when the patient has been transferred to the surgical ward and is less closely monitored.\r"

Mucormycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of central nervous system infections in intravenous drug abusers with AIDS. A brain biopsy is needed for the diagnosis of mucormycosis.\r"

While significant mortality due to ventilatory failure has been associated with this syndrome, this complication can now be readily managed. However, an estimated mortality of 5% to 20% remains attributable to medical complications (pulmonary embolus, sepsis) and to acute cardiovascular collapse due to autonomic failure. In this report, detailed sequential changes in hemodynamic parameters, as measured by Swan-Ganz catheter, associated with severe autonomic cardiovascular instability in a patient with GBS are described. Knowledge of changes in these hemodynamic parameters led to optimal therapy. Long-term Swan-Ganz monitoring in an intensive care setting may dramatically benefit the critically ill patient with GBS and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, and may help to eliminate the residual morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.\r"

Speaking may not affect their clinical outcome; time spent with them takes time away from other, more \"viable\" patients. Comatose patients may, however, hear; many have normal brain-stem auditory evoked responses and normal physiologic responses to auditory stimuli. Not talking to comatose patients may promote the notion that they are dead or nearly dead; not talking may become a self-fulfilling prophecy, influencing physicians to inappropriately withhold or withdraw therapy. Because comatose patients are especially vulnerable, and because some comatose patients may recover, physicians should consider talking to these patients. Our analysis suggests that families, medical students, and house staff would benefit from the humane example modeled by those clinicians who care for and talk to all patients.\r"

Second, a retrospective analysis of competence in 92 inpatients on a neurobehavioral service was carried out. The model was a useful way to view competence, at least in this population. Competence could be classified as operational, limited to a single cognitive domain, or as general, cutting across all domains in a way for which no compensation could be devised. The results suggest that a model of competence based on analysis of individual cognitive operations will provide a sound clinical approach to a common problem that is presently not well characterized.\r"

Even if contractions of the bladder occur, urinary outflow may be completely blocked at the sphincter, leading to distention of the bladder and the risk of urinary infection. A method is described for controllably relaxing the sphincter, which permits free outflow of urine in paraplegic cats. One pudendal nerve is sectioned, paralyzing half of the sphincter, but leaving the experimental animals entirely continent. The motoneurons supplying the other half of the sphincter are inhibited by means of spinal reflexes, eliminating active resistance to urethral flow. The simplicity of this approach suggests that it may prove equally effective in human paraplegia.\r"

Consideration was given to in vivo and in vitro factors known to influence levels of various CSF constituents. Results showed statistically significant decreases in the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, homocarnosine, phosphoethanolamine, and threonine, and elevation of ornithine levels, in the CSF of de novo patients with Parkinson's disease compared with controls. These changes \"normalized\" following treatment with carbidopa/levodopa. This study suggests that Parkinson's disease may be characterized by defects in specific amino compound metabolic pathways, resulting in central nervous system amino compound imbalances that may contribute to the pathophysiology of this disorder. Carbidopa/levodopa therapy tends to \"normalize\" these amino compound imbalances.\r"

The lowest concentrations were detected among fluids drained from under rhegmatogenous detachments ranging from five days' to one year's duration.

Two patients had previous blind spot enlargement that resolved over several months. The scotoma in each patients was absolute, measured 15 degrees to 20 degrees in diameter, had steep geographic margins, and extended to within 5 degrees to 10 degrees of fixation. Typically, patients had normal visual acuity, color vision, pupillary responses, and ophthalmoscopic findings. Photostress recovery, tested in two patients, was prolonged in the affected eye. Fluorescein angiography showed no abnormalities corresponding to the scotoma. Orbital computed tomographic scans in three patients and visual evoked responses in one patient were normal. Multifocal electroretinography, performed in two patients, showed loss of retinal waveforms in a large region surrounding the optic disc. Our findings suggest that retinal dysfunction produces this big blind spot syndrome, but we do not know its cause.\r"

The drusen group read fewer letters than the control group on all of the charts tested. This difference increased as the contrast of the charts decreased. The loss of performance on all of the Regan charts correlated with drusen severity. Twenty-one eyes with drusen and normal Snellen acuity also were tested with a Ginsburg contrast sensitivity chart and compared with age-matched normal controls. The results showed a loss of contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequencies and a loss of peak contrast sensitivity with increasing drusen severity. These results suggest that in patients with drusen, low-contrast charts may be useful for measuring visual loss not detected by standard Snellen charts.\r"

In two additional cases, Acanthamoeba keratitis was not diagnosed until significant stromal involvement was present. Medical therapy was effective in eradicating the organism in one case, although penetrating keratoplasty was necessary for visual rehabilitation. In the other case, medical therapy was ineffective, as corneal perforation resulted and Acanthamoeba cysts were demonstrated by fluorescent staining in the host corneal button.\r"

Cells incorporating tritiated thymidine included keratocytes, episcleral cells, corneal and capillary endothelial cells, and conjunctival and corneal epithelial cells. Transmission electron microscopy was correlated with the autoradiographic results to demonstrate that fibroblasts were dividing on the corneoscleral margin. These findings have potential clinical implications for the use of antiproliferative agents after filtration surgery.\r"

Roentgenographic evaluation by plain roentgenography is inconclusive in most cases; polytomography is helping to some extent. Recent generations of high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) scanners are probably the best. Seven cases of unilateral and three cases of bilateral congenital aural atresia were evaluated with high-resolution CT. Subsequently, ten ears were operated on. Surgical findings were correlated with CT scan findings with respect to atresia plate, extent of pneumatization, ossicular anomalies, bony facial nerve canal, and inner ear. Use of CT scans bears considerable importance in the management of these types of cases. High-resolution CT scan, when targeted for maximal bony detail, is possibly the method of choice in congenital aural atresia when surgical correction is contemplated.\r"

Three of these children were genetically impure natives, nine were of mixed parentage, and eight were \"continentals\" (with a birth origin other than the island). None of the genetically pure natives had otitis media. Our data show that, in a population with all factors in common except for familial and racial background, the point prevalence of otitis media is higher in children of mixed or continental origin than in genetically pure native children. The high prevalence of otitis media in children of mixed parentage and in one particular family of European ancestry suggests the presence of intrinsic or pronicity factors that are seemingly transmissible.\r"

Third, there was a more intense multicomponent SOAE in the right than in the left ear, and patient claimed that the tinnitus was louder in the right ear. Fourth, the patient's SOAEs were unstable and for this reason they might be audible. One practical consequences of this research is that patients with pathological tinnitus (which keeps them awake at night and interferes with concentration) should be tested for SOAEs. Because SOAEs are abolished by aspirin, it is possible that some unusual cases of problematic tinnitus could be easily treated.\r"

Results were compared with those obtained for a group of normal children tested under the same method before age 6 months. No hearing loss was observed in this group.

Increases in exposure time to cisplatin and fluorouracil from one to 24 hours resulted in approximately tenfold and 1000-fold increases, respectively, in cell lethality for both monolayer and MTS cells. Dose-response curves for cisplatin or fluorouracil on MTS cells closely followed those from monolayer cells, indicating good drug penetration into the MTS core. In contrast, dose-response curves on MTS cells after 24-hour exposure to cisplatin and cytarabine showed progressively lesser efficacy at higher drug concentrations. For monolayer cells, cisplatin plus fluorouracil and cisplatin plus cytarabine were both synergistic, the latter combination more synergistic than the former. For MTS cells, both combinations again showed synergistic interaction at moderate to high effect levels. Heightened synergistic interaction was demonstrated especially with the cisplatin plus cytarabine combination. Thus, the cisplatin plus cytarabine combination was always more synergistic than cisplatin plus fluorouracil. These data may serve as a basis for additional clinical trials of cisplatin plus cytarabine in the treatment of patients with head and neck carcinoma.\r"

In the present study, cisplatin and fluorouracil, used singly and in combination, were tested on two human squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, xenografted to nude mice. Cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg) was given as a single-dose intraperitoneal injection and fluorouracil as repeated intraperitoneal injections every eight hours for four days to a total dose of 200 mg/kg. The toxicity of the cisplatin and fluorouracil combination was lower (27%) than that of fluorouracil alone (50%). Both drugs gave a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor volume growth. Using gained growth delay as endpoint, cisplatin and fluorouracil therapy exhibited a synergistic effect on both tumor lines.\r"

  ".W": "The causes of temporary hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy are not well understood. In 18 patients undergoing unilateral (UL) and bilateral thyroid lobectomy (BL), an attempt was made to preserve all parathyroid glands with an intact blood supply. Total calcium (bound and free), free calcium (physiologically active form), albumin, parathyroid hormone, and calcitonin levels were serially measured. After UL, free calcium, parathyroid hormone, and calcitonin levels were unchanged, but total calcium level decreased because albumin level decreased. After BL, total calcium level decreased due to a decrease in albumin-bound calcium level. Free calcium level also decreased due to a decrease in parathyroid hormone level. Calcitonin level did not change. Despite careful preservation of the parathyroids and their blood supply, BL is frequently associated with temporary hypoparathyroidism. Techniques for preservation of parathyroid glands with their vascular integrity, correlation of surgical manipulation of parathyroids and calcium level, and calcium binding are discussed.\r"

This study was undertaken in an attempt to clarify the exact peripheral pathway of the marginal mandibular nerve. A series of 22 fresh cadaver heads were studied bilaterally by gross dissection and histologic studies. It was found that dissection superficial to the platysma up to a point 2 cm lateral to the lower lip can be done safely. Medial to this point, dissection is hazardous and is not indicated because the marginal mandibular nerve becomes more superficial as it travels to innervate its effector muscles. Additionally, dissection in this area is technically difficult because of the tight adherence of the skin to the underlying muscles. This adherence generally permits only the formation of fine superficial rhytids that are best treated by chemical peel or dermabrasion.\r"

Patients were assigned to one of six groups according to different combinations of induction agents (etomidate 0.3 mg kg-1 or thiopentone 3 mg kg-1, with fentanyl 0.003 mg kg-1; etomidate 0.4-0.5 mg kg-1 or thiopentone 4-6 mg kg-1, without fentanyl) and neuromuscular blocking drugs (vecuronium 0.112 mg kg-1, pancuronium 0.112 mg kg-1 or suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1). Anaesthesia was maintained with enflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. After initial diverse changes, heart rate decreased in all groups. Thirty minutes after intubation, the reduction of heart rate showed statistically significant differences between the different combinations of drugs: fentanyl-etomidate-vecuronium (group I) (the largest reduction) greater than etomidate-vecuronium (II) = fentanyl-thiopentone-vecuronium (IV) greater than thiopentone-vecuronium (V) = fentanyl-thiopentone-suxamethonium (VI) = fentanyl-etomidate-pancuronium (III). Five patients in group I, two in group IV and one each in groups II and V had a heart rate slower than 45 beat min-1, whereas a similar value was never seen in groups III and VI. These results indicate that vecuronium has a bradycardic effect. This effect is more pronounced in association with etomidate than in association with thiopentone, and is augmented by the addition of fentanyl.\r"

The same drug and dosage were continued and cardioventilatory indices, pain intensity and sedation measured for an observation period of 24 h. The sums of the pain intensity differences were equal in all groups. The mean doses for the complete initial analgesia were 230 and 180 micrograms kg-1 with the larger and the smaller bolus doses of morphine and 5.8 and 3.7 micrograms kg-1 with buprenorphine, respectively. The mean duration of action of buprenorphine was slightly but not significantly longer than that of morphine. The total consumption of both morphine and buprenorphine was less when the smaller bolus doses were used. Two patients developed a degree of ventilatory depression following repeated doses of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine was equal to morphine as a postoperative analgesic.\r"

The effects were observed for 35 min after drug administration. Choice reaction time, ability to tap two areas on a board and ability to perform mathematical problems were significantly impaired when inhaling nitrous oxide, the maximum effect being obtained within 5 min. With isoflurane, the effects were significantly greater than with nitrous oxide. The effect obtained after 15 min inhalation was greater than that at 5 min. Tests returned promptly to the base line after the discontinuation of the test agent. Subjective assessments were made using a series of eight visual analogue scales. Results of the scales represented by physical and mental sedation indicated that 0.4% isoflurane was more potent than 25% nitrous oxide. Significant effects were detected up to 15 min after the inhalation of the agent was stopped. Subanaesthetic concentrations of isoflurane warrant further study in patients undergoing dental treatment in which a rapid recovery from sedation is important.\r"

However, statistical analysis revealed that amethocaine was significantly better at producing full-depth anaesthesia to the challenge of insertion of a sterile needle. An optimized amethocaine formulation may therefore be expected to meet most closely the ideal profile for a percutaneous local anaesthetic preparation.\r"

The following studies were performed to determine if pretreatments with the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers pancuronium, atracurium or vecuronium would differ in their effects on the seizure threshold of lignocaine. Adult mongrel cats were anaesthetized with 1.0 MAC halothane in oxygen and nitrogen. Ventilation, blood-gas tensions, acid-base balance and temperature were controlled. Cats received pancuronium 0.2 mg kg 1 i.v. (n = 7), atracurium 1.0 mg kg-1 i.v. (n = 7) or vecuronium 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v. (n = 7). Ten minutes after the administration of the myoneural blocker, all cats received lignocaine 4 mg kg-1 min-1 i.v. until the onset of EEG evidence of generalized seizure activity. At seizure onset, there were no statistically significant differences among the cumulative lignocaine doses or the serum lignocaine concentrations in cats pretreated with pancuronium, atracurium or vecuronium.\r"

Although the average body weight of the bleomycin-treated rats decreased significantly compared with the saline-treated controls, no significant alterations in lung histology were found in regard to the occurrence of oedema, fibrosis, and type II pneumocytes. Intra-alveolar macrophages were significantly increased. Subsequent hyperoxia did not lead to a more pronounced effect, except for macrophage accumulation. The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were not changed either after administration of bleomycin alone or after combination with hyperoxia. It is concluded that bleomycin i.p. in doses comparable to those encountered clinically, administered alone or combined with hyperoxia, does not result in pulmonary damage in female Wistar rats.\r"

Although hepatocellular dysfunction accounted for some of the abnormality, a unique feature of the coagulopathy was the presence of an inhibitor of the thrombin clotting time. The potency of this circulating anticoagulant increased markedly during exacerbations of hepatic injury. The anticoagulant was removed from plasma samples from two of the patients by passage over a column of diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sephacel. It eluted from the DEAE at salt concentrations that removed \"high-charge\" glycosaminoglycans. Elimination of the purified anticoagulant activity in vitro required a combination of heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC, suggesting that the activity was mediated by both heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Suramin is hypothesized to inhibit enzymes that normally degrade glycosaminoglycans, resulting in accumulation of these substances, which are released from the liver into the circulation during periods of hepatic injury.\r"

Heterologous bovine EA were readily lysed by human serum, whereas human EA were quite resistant to lysis. Human EA bound as many C8 and C9 molecules per cell as bovine EA when incubated under identical conditions, but four times as much bound C9 was required to lyse an equal number of human EA compared with bovine EA. The susceptibility of human erythrocytes did not increase when increased volumes of undiluted human serum were used although C9 binding increased to as much as 100,000 molecules per cell. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant polymerized C9 (poly(C9)) was detected on both lysed ghosts and unlysed EA bearing complement proteins C1 through C9 (EAC1-9) after incubation with undiluted human serum; however, the ratio of poly(C9) to monomeric C9 was higher on unlysed cells than on ghosts. Although bovine and human EA bound equal amounts of human C9 at the end point, the rate of lysis and C9 uptake was slower on homologous cells. The rate-limiting step occurred before C9 binding and lysis because the rates of lysis and C9 binding were equal on homologous and heterologous EAC1-8 targets, but the extent of lysis of homologous cells was still lower than lysis of heterologous cells. Human erythrocytes lose restriction against homologous hemolysis during storage in autologous plasma or in isotonic buffers.\r"

It was also shown that activation of complement on homologous EA resulted in the binding of C9 and the formation of EA bearing complement proteins C1 through C9 (EAC1-9), yet few hemolytic sites were formed. Instead, as shown here, the formation of homologous EAC1-9 caused the cells to become resistant to lysis even by heterologous complement during a second incubation. In contrast, when homologous EAC1-8 were produced by incubating EA with C9-depleted serum, such intermediates were not protected against lysis by heterologous complement during a second incubation. Furthermore, homologous C9 on EAC1-9 was able to reduce the hemolytic efficiency of heterologous complement without blocking C activation and the formation of new C5b-9 complexes. Protection was not modified when homologous EAC1-9 were produced in one step, by incubation of EA with serum, or sequentially by adding C9 to EAC1-8. The minimum number of 9-sites required to confer a protective effect on EAC1-9 was less than 200 per cell. Thus, in addition to its known effect in heterologous cell killing, homologous C9 is capable of protecting homologous cells against inadvertent complement lysis.\r"

  ".U": "88108136\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported the purification of a 37-kd platelet-agglutinating protein (PAP p37) from the plasma of a patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) that was shown to be present in a subset of TTP patients. The platelet agglutination induced by PAP p37 has been shown to be inhibited by IgG from normal human adults and the same TTP patient after recovery. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of IgG, the interaction between PAP p37 and IgG was studied. The complex formation was demonstrated by the binding of fluid-phase IgG from normal adults and the same TTP patient after recovery to adsorbed PAP by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The binding was specific, concentration dependent, and saturable. IgG purified from a 5-month-old baby and the same TTP patient during active disease did not form complex with PAP p37. The IgG covalently cross-linked to Sepharose 4B bound 125I-PAP p37 but not 125I-fibrinogen. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of a mixture of 125I-PAP p37 and IgG also revealed the fluid-phase complex formation with a sedimentation value of 19S. Complexes of molecular weight ranging from 180,000 to over 350,000 daltons were also detected by molecular sieve chromatography. The IgG that was bound to PAP p37 conjugated to Sepharose 4B inhibited the agglutination of washed platelets induced by TTP plasma containing PAP p37, whereas the IgG that was not bound to PAP p37 did not have a significant inhibitory effect. The complex formation between PAP p37 and specific IgG is likely to account for the in vitro inhibition of TTP plasma-induced agglutination and, at least partly, the in vivo successful treatment with specific IgG-containing normal plasma.\r"

Although erythroid abnormalities were prominent in all, 12 patients also showed involvement of the granulocytic and/or megakaryocytic cell lines, and nonrandom chromosomal aberrations were observed in five of 23 patients studied for such defects. Measurements of erythroid marrow function showed in most cases erythroid expansion with ineffective erythropoiesis. In seven patients, however, the erythroid activity was found to be inappropriately low for the degree of anemia. Transfusion dependence occurred in 26 of 37 cases. Iron overload was a common feature at presentation but produced clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis only in those patients who subsequently had a regular need for blood transfusions. Five patients progressed to bone marrow failure, and another five patients (two of whom had monosomy 7) evolved into acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). The median survival was 72 months, with a high transfusion requirement, multilineage defects, and inappropriately low erythroid proliferation being associated with a poor prognosis. The most common causes of death were complications of iron overload and evolution into ANLL. We conclude that (a) the natural history of IRSA is characterized by an initial phase of erythroid hyperplasia and ineffective erythropoiesis, which is usually stable for many years but in a subset of patients may be followed by a phase of marrow failure with or without the later emergence of leukemic blasts; (b) peripheral blood counts, measurement of erythroid marrow function, and chromosomal analysis are useful for identifying subjects at risk of evolution into marrow failure or ANLL; and (c) IRSA patients with no need for blood transfusions are very likely to be long survivors, whereas those who become transfusion dependent are at risk of death from the complications of secondary hemochromatosis.\r"

The alpha 2 polyadenylation signal mutation occurs in other Middle Eastern and the Mediterranean populations and is responsible for the clinical phenotype of Hb H disease in some Saudi Arabian individuals with five alpha genes (alpha T Saudi alpha/(alpha alpha alpha)T Saudi). Evidence suggests that the (alpha alpha alpha)T Saudi haplotype has arisen as a result of a recombination between two misaligned chromosomes bearing the alpha T Saudi alpha defect.\r"

In this study, we explored the capacity of human marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells to adhere in vitro to the extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by human marrow fibroblasts. When marrow mononuclear cells were incubated on ECM-coated dishes, all types of progenitors adhered to this substrate through an active process requiring divalent cations and serum factors. The proportion of erythropoietic progenitors attached to ECM in two hours was at least twofold higher than that of granulopoietic progenitors. Moreover, in the erythroid lineage, the capacity to adhere to ECM increased with the degree of differentiation of the progenitor: 28% of CFU-E adhered to ECM as compared with 13% of immature BFU-E. Thus, ECM-mediated adherence varied both with the cell lineage and the maturation stage of the progenitor. Purified fibronectin could substitute for ECM in the adhesion assay, and ECM-mediated adhesion of CFU-E and BFU-E was partially inhibited by a polyclonal antifibronectin antibody, which implies that fibronectin may be one ECM component involved in progenitor cell adhesion. Incomplete inhibition of progenitor adhesion to ECM by the antifibronectin antibody, however, as well as the lower proportion of precursors attaching to purified fibronectin as compared with ECM suggest that other matrix molecules may also mediate erythroid progenitors attachment to ECM. These observations support the idea that hematopoietic progenitor cells may regulate their differentiation in part through the modulation of adhesive interactions with a number of constituents of the microenvironment.\r"

After 6 months of heparin treatment, discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy was accompanied by persistent hypofibrinogenemia with increased fibrinogen consumption. With continuous infusion of heparin, fibrinogen turnover normalized, and the child has remained free of thrombosis. Both the immunologic level of PC and the functional activity measured by amidolytic assay were moderately reduced (47% and 34%, respectively). Functional activity of PC measured by its anticoagulant activity was disproportionately lower (14%). A 3-year-old asymptomatic sibling had a similar disproportionate reduction of PC anticoagulant activity compared with the amidolytic activity or immunologic level. The mother demonstrated type I PC deficiency with a proportionate reduction in immunologic protein levels (59%), anticoagulant activity (52%), and amidolytic activity (46%), whereas the father had type II PC deficiency with normal immunologic protein levels (102%), normal amidolytic function (98%), but a low anticoagulant function (50%). An abnormal PC molecule was detected by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis in the father and two children. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the children are doubly heterozygous for two different types of PC deficiency inherited from each of the parents. A 14-day trial of danazol in the proband resulted in a rise in the PC antigen concentration from 66% to 98% but no change in PC anticoagulant function.\r"

Multiple linear regression analyses identified the major factors influencing one-hour-corrected increments (CI) as prior splenectomy, bone marrow transplantation, disseminated intravascular coagulation, concurrent intravenous amphotericin B, splenomegaly, and HLA antibody grade. The relative impact of these factors on CI has been quantitated by using a formula developed from these data. A linear relationship was demonstrated between increasing percentage of HLA antibody grade and decreasing CI. A number of other factors were less important in the linear regression model than the aforementioned major factors. These included platelet-specific antibodies, concurrent antibacterial antibiotics, clinical bleeding grade, and temperature. Factors that did not influence CI included the number of prior platelet transfusions, prior granulocyte transfusions, prior red cell transfusions, infection, age, blood group, diagnosis, sex, pretransfusion platelet count, prior pregnancies, and concurrent antineoplastic drugs. This study identified major clinical factors that significantly influenced CI and were major causes of refractoriness to pooled platelet transfusions.\r"

  ".W": "Platelets are known to process human factor V during secretion and/or membrane binding. We studied the functional and structural changes produced in human factor V by purified human platelet calpain (calcium-activated thiol protease) and compared the alterations with those induced by thrombin. A maximum increase in coagulant activity of 2.5-fold was observed when factor V (1 U/mL, 33 nmol/L) was incubated with calpain (0.03 U/mL, 2.7 nmol/L) in comparison with a 8.8-fold increment for alpha-thrombin (0.7 U/mL, 8 nmol/L) at 25 degrees C. Thrombin additions to reactions initiated by calpain resulted in further activation comparable to that of thrombin alone, whereas the subsequent addition of calpain had no effect on the extent or pattern of the activation of factor V by thrombin. The cleavage pattern of factor V produced by these two enzymes are distinctly different. Although thrombin activation eventually results in four final components designated C1 (150 kd), D (105 kd), E (71 kd), and F1F2 (71 to 74 kd), calpain yields initial components of 200 kd and 160 kd within one minute. Further digestion of the 200 kd species by calpain gives rise first to a polypeptide of 160 kd that is converted to a 140 kd and a 120 kd species by two minutes with an increase in coagulant activity. Immunoblotting of these fragments with the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) B10 directed to factor V and the thrombin-generated C1 fragment yields results demonstrating a common epitope in these calpain-generated components of 200, 160, 140 and 120 kd. The degradation of the initial 160 kd polypeptide gives rise to polypeptides of 100 and 65 kd, both undetectable on immunoblotting with MoAb B10. The 130, 87, 58, and 48 kd components are of less certain origin. Thus, platelet calpain generates a complex but reproducible cleavage pattern different from thrombin that may explain the partial activation observed. Nevertheless, calpain processing may play a role in early hemostatic reactions involving platelets before the appearance of the first thrombin molecule.\r"

In terms of the specific chromosomal abnormalities, there are no differences between the various treatment groups. Hypodiploidy is the most common form of aneuploidy in these patients, with the most common numerical abnormality being the loss of chromosome 7. The most common structural abnormalities involved chromosomes 3 and 5. When compared with patients with de novo leukemia and DMS, the chromosomal abnormalities in these patients are more complex and extensive. Serial studies revealed that cytogenetic abnormalities do not precede the development of hematologic changes by significant time periods.\r"

Both patients exhibited a clinical picture characteristic of HCL, including splenomegaly, cytopenias, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive \"hairy\" lymphocytes in blood and marrow. EH and HK were demonstrably of B lineage, as judged by cytochemistry and immunophenotype, including expression of B1, B2, and LEU-12 antigens and of monoclonal surface immunoglobulins (slgs). Monoclonality was confirmed by clonal karyotype abnormality demonstrated in cell line HK. HCL parentage suggested by cytochemistry and electron microscopy was confirmed by the immunophenotypic observation that HCL lines expressed antigens alpha S-HCL1, alpha S-HCL3, and cCLLa. While alpha S-HCL1 and alpha S-HCL3 are nonspecific, their co-expression is characteristic of HCL cells. The cCLLa is a novel 69-kd membrane HCL-associated polypeptide antigen not shared by circulating normal T or B lymphocytes nor by malignant cells from unrelated lymphoid or nonlymphoid malignancies. The doubling time of EH and HK was 24 and 36 hours, respectively. While HK included a small subset of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-positive cells, EH cells were homogeneously negative for the presence of this antigen. Both cell lines were consistently implantable in irradiation-preconditioned immunodeficient mice giving rise to primary tumors and widespread metastasis.\r"

Previous studies have demonstrated that DF3 antigen levels are elevated in plasma of patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, MAb DF3 reacts with circulating glycoproteins of different molecular weights ranging from approximately 300 to 450 kd. The present study demonstrates that plasma DF3 antigen is comprised of at least four moieties with slow (S), intermediate (I), rapid (R) and very rapid (VR) electrophoretic mobilities. The electrophoretic mobility patterns for circulating DF3 antigen differ among individuals. Moreover, DF3 antigen is detectable in urine, and the electrophoretic mobility of the urinary moieties is similar, but not identical, to that in the plasma. Studies in family members suggest that the electrophoretic heterogeneity of plasma DF3 antigen is determined by codominant expression of multiple alleles at a single locus. This locus may code for the core protein of DF3 antigen. These findings thus identify a genetically determined polymorphism of a circulating tumor-associated glycoprotein.\r"

Lactoferrin was precipitated with antilactoferrin serum and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by fluorography. In contrast to myeloperoxidase of azurophil granules, lactoferrin was not synthesized as a larger precursor, and it was not found to be phosphorylated. The transfer to granules of newly synthesized lactoferrin was demonstrated in pulse-chase labeling experiments followed by centrifugation of cell homogenate in a Percoll gradient. Monensin, which exchanges protons for Na+ and NH4+ cation, blocked the transfer completely, indicating a need for acidification mechanisms. Unlike myeloperoxidase, newly synthesized lactoferrin rapidly became resistant to endoglycosidase H, indicating a transport through the medial and transcisternae of the Golgi apparatus with conversion of \"high mannose\" to \"complex\" oligosaccharide side chains. Intracellular transfer of some major neutrophil azurophil and specific granule constituents is obviously regulated differently. Lactoferrin seems to be processed like proteins destined for secretion, while myeloperoxidase is processed more or less like lysosomal enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "Recent in vitro studies have shown that di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP) inhibits the deterioration of RBCs during refrigerated storage in containers that use this compound as a plasticizer. The experiments described in this report were designed to assess whether this in vitro protective effect of DEHP would result in a prolonged in vivo survival of RBCs infused into normal human recipients. Whole blood collected from ten normal donors was stored for 35 days in citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA-1) anticoagulant contained in polyvinylchloride (PVC) bags plasticized with DEHP or a trimellitate compound that is known to have low leachability. Aliquots of RBCs from each container were then labeled with chromium-51 and were reinfused into the original donors. For blood stored in DEHP-plasticized PVC bags, 24% more red cells survived in vivo 24 hours after reinfusion than was observed when the blood had been stored in trimellitate-plasticized bags (P less than .001). Whole blood stored in glass bottles showed a similar improvement in in vivo survival when DEHP was added in weekly increments to mimic the accumulation of this plasticizer seen during storage in plastic containers. Survival of packed red cells stored in the presence of DEHP increased by 14% compared with storage in trimellitate-plasticized bags (P less than .05). In agreement with previous studies, hemolysis and microvesicle formation were also reduced in the presence of DEHP. These results suggest that proposed new storage systems lacking DEHP should be carefully evaluated to determine whether adequate post-transfusion survival of RBCs may be achieved.\r"

  ".W": "A gamma-chain variant with an apparently higher molecular weight than the normal gamma-chain was detected in a new congenital abnormal fibrinogen with impaired polymerization of the fibrin monomer and with normal release of fibrinopeptides A and B in a 51-year-old male. Purified fibrinogen analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under the reduced condition in the system of Laemmli contained two protein bands in the gamma-chain region (molecular weight, 50,500 as compared with 50,000 for the normal), both with normal crosslinking ability. The presence of two types of gamma-chains was more clearly detected when reduced and carboxymethylated fibrinogen was analyzed by SDS-PAGE or when reduced fragment D2 was analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, and identified by positive staining for anti gamma-chain monoclonal antibody. Cyanogen bromide- or lysylendopeptidase-cleavage of purified gamma-chains analyzed on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography showed the decrease of one peptide compared with the normal and the appearance of an abnormal peptide peak. Amino acid sequence analysis demonstrated that the gamma arginine-275 of gamma-chain variant was replaced by a cysteine. These data suggest that some regions or conformations containing gamma 275 will affect the polymerization of fibrin monomers. The propositus' two daughters had the same abnormal fibrinogen. This unique inherited abnormal fibrinogen was designated as fibrinogen Tochigi, and the gamma-chain variant as gamma Tochigi.\r"

This mechanism would predict that the beta A and beta C synthetic capacity in alpha-thalassemic individuals with Hb C trait should be balanced despite the low levels of Hb C in their circulating erythrocytes. To directly test this prediction, we have measured the beta A and beta C synthetic capacity of reticulocyte RNA isolated from two individuals with Hb C trait, one with a normal alpha-globin genotype and one with alpha-thalassemia. The balanced expression of beta A and beta C in both cases supports the proposed posttranslational control over Hb C expression.\r"

  ".W": "The NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase catalyzing the respiratory burst in activated phagocytes from healthy individuals is not operative in phagocytes from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). In a microscopic slide test using the dye nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), carriers of X-linked CGD can be recognized by a mosaic pattern of NBT-positive and NBT-negative cells, governed by the expression of an unaffected or an affected X chromosome, respectively. Until now, it has not been possible to detect carriers of the autosomal form of CGD (other than by family studies) because all cells of these carriers stain positive in the NBT test. We have investigated whether neutrophils from carriers of autosomal CGD can be recognized by measurement of the rate of oxygen uptake upon stimulation of the cells. It was found that with the phorbol ester PMA as a stimulus, the respiratory burst is significantly lower in autosomal CGD carriers. With serum-treated zymosan as a stimulus, no difference between controls and carriers was observed. The addition of f-Met-Leu-Phe (1 microM) to PMA-activated neutrophils of control donors caused a transient increase in oxygen consumption of about 40%. Under these conditions, an increase of more than 100% was observed in neutrophils from carriers of autosomal CGD. These findings provide a simple method for the detection of carriers of the autosomal form of CGD.\r"

Using one-dimensional electrophoresis, a sharp 78 kd fragment was present with a reciprocal decrease of the alpha I 80 kd domain. Kinetic analysis unambiguously confirmed that the 78 kd fragment developed at the expense of the alpha I 80 domain. The alpha I 74 kd peptide was not flanked with a peptide lacking a 2 kd fragment. From this fact, it could be inferred that the site for additional proteolysis is located upstream from arginyl residue 39 and, more precisely, should lie 10 to 20 amino-acid residues (-2 kd) from the alpha-chain N-terminus. The percentage of spectrin dimers in 4 degrees C extracts was high (over 40%), contrasting with the absence of clinical symptoms related to elliptocytosis.

Because key antioxidant defense reactions are linked to the pyridine nucleotides nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), we tested the hypothesis that the RBC redox potential as manifested by the NADH/[NAD+ + NADH] and NADPH/[NADP+ + NADPH] ratios is decreased in sickle erythrocytes. Our data demonstrate that sickle RBCs have a significant decrease in the NADH/[NAD+ + NADH] ratio compared with normal RBCs (P less than .00005). Interestingly, sickle RBCs also had a significant increase in total NAD content compared with normal RBCs (P less than .00005). In contrast, although sickle RBCs had a significant increase in the total NADP content compared with normal RBCs (P less than .00005), sickle RBCs had no significant alteration in the NADPH/[NADP+ + NADPH] ratio. High reticulocyte controls demonstrated that these changes were not related to cell age. Thus, sickle RBCs have a decrease in NAD redox potential that may be a reflection of their increased oxidant sensitivity. The changes in these pyridine nucleotides may have further metabolic consequences for the sickle erythrocyte.\r"

High density (HD) platelets expressed 12% more P1A1 molecules (46,942) than low density (LD) platelets (41,892). However, LD platelets carried 42% more HLA-A2 molecules (6,267 +/- 184) than HD platelets (4,406 +/- 232) (P less than .01) and 55% more class I HLA antigens (17,034 +/- 2,062 v 11,007 +/- 2,190) (P = .05). The platelet subpopulations did not differ in their content of glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa complex or Baka antigen. The difference in expression of class I HLA antigens on HD and LD platelets is consistent with two possibilities: either class I HLA molecules are acquired from plasma or they are released into plasma as platelets age in circulation. Accordingly, class I HLA molecules may provide a useful marker of platelet age.\r"

  ".W": "Information on the relationship between the plasma concentration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and clinical response in rheumatoid arthritis is sparse. As a result treatment is often relatively empirical. Standard doses are prescribed and an apparent lack of response leads either to the prescription of another drug, or an increase in the dose beyond that recommended. This study investigated 18 patients given three doses (500, 1000 and 1500 mg/day) of naproxen in a randomized double-blind design for 12 days at a time. Using a linear modelling approach we found that three out of four clinical response measurements improved linearly with increasing naproxen trough concentrations, suggesting that most patients will achieve an improvement in symptoms if the dose of naproxen is increased up to 1500 mg/day. However, since trough naproxen concentrations show a less than proportional increase with increasing dose (due to saturation of binding sites on plasma albumin), the improvement in response will be less dramatic as the dose is increased.\r"

This value is significantly higher than the 17.4 per cent recorded in those undergoing gastrectomy alone or with incomplete removal of the invaded organs (P less than 0.05). In 189 patients with incurable factors, the 5-year survival rates were 5.4 and 2.8 per cent respectively in cases of complete and incomplete excisions. This tendency was similar in patients with a single invaded organ and also in those with plural organ involvement. In potentially curable patients treated by complete excision, the probability of long-term survival was statistically better than that following incomplete excision only when the pancreas was involved (P less than 0.05). We recommend complete excision of invaded organs, irrespective of the number or site of organs involved, provided that there is no evidence of incurable factors.\r"

Out-patient follow-up (mean: 37 months) of patients treated by undersewing alone revealed that 73 per cent were symptom free. Treatment of bleeding gastric ulceration by undersewing alone is effective and should be considered in patients who require surgery.\r"

The tumour was localized (Dukes' classification A or B) in 61 per cent of patients, as compared with 47 per cent in the previous 10-year period. This change was, in part, due to different interpretation of stage definitions. Clear improvements of the results were, however, also noted. Radical surgery was possible in 76 per cent of patients and the primary tumour was removed in 93 per cent. Surgical mortality was 4.4 per cent and complication rate 15 per cent, significantly less than earlier (6.5 and 38 per cent, respectively). Increasing numbers of sphincter-saving operations were performed in rectal cancers (47 per cent as compared with 24 per cent in the previous 10-year period). The overall 5-year survival rate improved from 40.5 to 52.5 per cent. Premalignant conditions were identified in 12.6 per cent of patients: previous CRC 4.8 per cent, cancer family syndrome 4.1 per cent, ulcerative colitis 1.7 per cent and familial adenomatosis 0.6 per cent. In order to sustain the favourable trend of improving survival prospects, more emphasis must be directed to the detection of early stage cancers.\r"

DNA ploidy status was determined by flow cytometry. In all, 39 (33 per cent) patients had DNA diploid tumours and 80 (67 per cent) patients had DNA aneuploid tumours. In four cases, tumour material was not obtained. The patients with DNA aneuploid tumours had a worse prognosis than those with DNA diploid tumours, but this was only seen in those patients classified as Dukes' B. In a Cox's regression analysis, the surgeon's assessment of operability was the strongest predictor of survival, followed by the pathological classification and the patient's age. After these factors had been considered, the DNA ploidy status conferred no independent survival value.\r"

Maximum resting pressure (MRP) and maximum voluntary contraction pressures (MVC) were compared using a standard station pull-through technique in 12 patients. There was a poor correlation for both MRP: microballoon, 115 cmH2O (60-160 cmH2O); transducer 60 (20-110), r = 0.62, P less than 0.05, and MVC: microballoon, 202 (60-375); transducer, 175 (60-210), r = 0.42, n.s. To determine whether this was due to radial variation in pressures measured by the transducer, we studied a further 39 patients with both systems. At each station, transducer measurements were made at each of four quadrants. We found better correlation for MRP: microballoon, 100 (40-175); transducer, 66 (34-120), r = 0.72, P less than 0.001, and MVC: microballoon, 225 (55-650); transducer, 180 (50-470), r = 0.87, P less than 0.001, but a significant radial variation for the transducer where rotation reduced MRP pressure measurements by 21 per cent (0-600 per cent), and MVC 17 per cent (0-76 per cent). Moreover there was a significant difference between anterior and posterior MRP in the upper anal canal, anterior 35 (5-80) versus posterior 25 (10-60), P less than 0.05. These results account for the poor correlation between random positioning of the microtransducer-tipped catheter and indicate that radial orientation must be taken into account.\r"

To investigate this concept we studied 18 patients with faecal incontinence and 18 age and sex matched controls. A microtransducer catheter was positioned so that pressures were recorded from the rectum, the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the anal canal and the lower anal canal. Recordings were taken at rest and while distending the rectum with air in a balloon, and then with air injected freely into the rectum. Sampling (equalization of the rectal and upper anal canal pressures) was seen to occur spontaneously in 16 of the controls and only 6 of the incontinent group (P less than 0.02) and induced sampling occurred at a higher rectal volume in the incontinent group than in controls for freely injected air (P less than 0.002). Defective anorectal sampling may be an important contributory factor in the pathogenesis of anorectal incontinence.\r"

  ".W": "The most important factor associated with a good result in the surgical treatment of neurogenic faecal incontinence by postanal repair is considered to be restoration of the obtuse anorectal angle. Sixteen patients (14F:2M; median age 59 years) with neurogenic faecal incontinence confirmed by a raised fibre density in the external anal sphincter underwent postanal repair. Pre- and postoperative manometric assessment was performed in 16 and radiological assessment in 12. Normal ranges for these parameters were established in age and sex matched control subjects. Continence was improved in 14 (88 per cent) patients, 6 (38 per cent) of whom regained normal continence, at a minimum of 15 months follow-up. A successful outcome was associated with no significant change in basal (pre-operative 35 (10-85) cmH2O, postoperative 44 (12-105) cmH2O; n.s.) or voluntary (pre-operative 43 (5-150) cmH2O, postoperative 32 (12-180) cmH2O; n.s.) components of anal canal pressure. There was a small but significant increase in sphincter length (pre-operative 2 (0-3) cm, postoperative 2.5 (0-3.5) cm; P less than 0.01). There was no significant change in the anorectal angle at rest (pre-operative 96 (90-110) degrees, postoperative 107 (79-118) degrees; n.s.) in the patients in whom continence was restored and five of these patients had resting anorectal angles within the normal range (75-94 degrees). Thus postanal repair need not be restricted to patients with widening of the anorectal angle since its beneficial effects do not appear to be related to reduction of this angle.\r"

The relationship between the estimated anal sphincter pressure on digital palpation and the measured pressure on anal manometry was investigated and the interrelationship between anal manometry, rectal capacity and the saline infusion test was defined. A significant correlation (P less than 0.001) was found between digitally and manometrically measured anal sphincter pressure. Considering the relationship between the three specific anorectal function tests, only manometry and the saline infusion test correlated to some extent (P less than 0.01). This study shows that digital palpation is helpful in anorectal function investigation, but to establish the exact anal pressures, anal manometry is mandatory. Furthermore, the poor correlation observed indicates that single tests represent different aspects of anorectal function and therefore they need to be performed together.\r"

The case notes of all new patients with Crohn's disease attending one hospital between 1977 and 1983 were reviewed: there were 61 patients with this diagnosis and an unhealed anal fissure as the only anal lesion. Of these 61 patients the fissure healed in 42 (69 per cent) during medical treatment of the intestinal disease. Ten patients (16 per cent) developed other anal lesions and in the remaining nine patients the fissure remained unhealed at the time of rectal excision (six) or last out-patient attendance (three). Activity of the fissure did not reflect disease activity elsewhere in 11 cases in whom healing of the fissure occurred despite progressive intestinal disease subsequently requiring resection. This study validates the policy of conservative management of anal fissure in Crohn's disease with anal surgery (required in 9.8 per cent of patients in this series) being reserved for the development of other anal disease.\r"

Healing per primam occurred in 42 patients (58 per cent; 95 per cent confidence limits: 45-69) within 10 weeks after treatment. These patients had significantly fewer pits and lateral tracts compared with patients who developed excessive granulation tissue after incision and who required definitive surgical treatment later. Nine patients (21 per cent; 95 per cent confidence limits: 10-37) with healing per primam developed recurrence of their pilonidal disease during the prospective follow-up period (median follow-up period was 60 months, range 36-84 months).

All too frequently the conventional treatment options have already been used, the patient having received external beam radiotherapy and possibly cytotoxic chemotherapy. In such circumstances, and provided that the primary tumour remains under control, a positive approach to the further management of the neck metastases should be adopted, given that the patient is in otherwise reasonable health and does not have gross distant metastatic disease. We describe our experience with postoperative interstitial irradiation (brachytherapy) using after-loaded iridium-192 (192Ir) wires positioned at the site of the tumour after its surgical exposure and debulking or clearance. All the treated patients had previously received external beam irradiation to the neck and in the first three cases local skin necrosis occurred as a sequel to interstitial implantation. Therefore, in the other five patients, cutaneous or myocutaneous flaps were used to resurface the area at the time of implant placement. This combination of techniques, which has not been described previously, provided local tumour control in four out of the five cases without irradiation necrosis occurring in any of them.\r"

In each case, primary closure of the wound was facilitated by the use of a myocutaneous flap. Four ilio-inguinal lymph node dissections were closed with rectus abdominis flaps, two cervical dissections were closed with a pectoralis major flap, and a limited latissimus dorsi flap was used for one axillary clearance. Primary healing was achieved in all cases; morbidity was low, with one wound infection and two limited lymphatic collections. All donor sites were closed primarily and healed well. We conclude that in selected patients the use of a myocutaneous flap procedure gives excellent coverage of large defects with low morbidity. In particular, there is rapid convalescence and return of good function after palliative resections, while the wide excision minimizes local recurrence where the tumour is in proximity to overlying skin.\r"

These 34 patients constituted 3.5 per cent of the total number of patients (972) reviewed over this period. Six of the thirty-four patients were either Polynesian or Maori. There were 19 men and 15 women, and the mean age of the group was 59 years. The primary lesion arose from the plantar or palmar skin in 25 patients and 9 patients had subungual lesions. All lesions but one were pigmented. Most patients with plantar or palmar lesions presented with clinical stage 1, Clark's level 4 disease, while those with subungual lesions presented most commonly with stage 2, Clark's level 5 disease. Treatment was wide local resection for plantar and palmar lesions and amputation for subungual lesions. Regional lymph node dissection was performed in 10 patients with positive nodes at presentation and in 6 patients who developed metachronous nodal disease. Patients were followed for between 1 and 16 years, and 18 patients died in this period, 15 of metastatic melanoma (mean time 34 months). Subungual melanoma carried a worse prognosis than melanoma arising in palmar or plantar skin.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate muscular function in HPT quantitatively and to evaluate the effect of parathyroid surgery in this respect. The maximal isokinetic muscle strength (peak torque) of knee extension and flexion was measured with a Cybex-II dynamometer in 16 patients with primary HPT (mean serum calcium 2.81 +/- 0.14 mmol/l), four of whom had subjective impairment of strength, and in nine control patients submitted to hemithyroidectomy due to atoxic thyroid adenoma. Before surgery there was no significant difference in muscle strength between the two groups, neither was there any consistent relationship between the subjective feeling of muscular weakness and the measured peak torque. Seven months after surgery the HPT patients had increased their muscle strength by 8 per cent (P less than 0.05). The improvement was correlated with the pre-operative serum calcium levels (r = 0.56, P = 0.02) and was particularly seen in patients with pre-operative subjective muscular weakness. Patients with only slightly raised calcium values and without subjective muscular symptoms did not benefit clearly from surgery, compared with the controls. The study demonstrates that HPT patients, especially those with neuromuscular symptoms, can improve their muscle strength after parathyroid surgery.\r"

After removal, the grafts were examined by autoradiography for an evaluation of the platelet aggregation pattern. Measurements of activity in different regions of the grafts were also performed. The results indicated low activity uptakes both in vivo and in vitro. The dynamic study did not show any uniform increase of activity content 1-3 h postoperatively, in any of the groups. During the period 2-3 h postoperatively no increasing activity accumulation was found. Hemashield Microvel grafts had an uptake of 0.19 per cent of the total activity while the corresponding figure for peritoneal tube grafts was 0.17 per cent. The activity distribution on different parts of the grafts indicated lower accumulation on the Hemashield graft surfaces than in the anastomoses, while the accumulation was higher on the graft surface of peritoneal tube grafts. The autoradiographical findings supported this indication. In conclusion, low platelet aggregation was found with both dynamic in vivo imaging and in vitro activity measurements on both peritoneal tube grafts and collagen-coated double velour grafts.\r"

Surgery was performed at an average of 17 days (range 8-25 days) after the onset of symptoms. The pancreatic slough was thoroughly debrided and 2-6 large drains were placed in the pancreatic bed. Irrigation with saline or Diaflex solution (2-6 l/day) was started after 2 days and continued for a mean of 25 days (range 5-54 days). There were three deaths (27.3 per cent) after surgery: one of these patients required reoperation and packing for massive postoperative haemorrhage and all three had some evidence of persisting sepsis at autopsy. Prolonged irrigation of the pancreatic bed after surgical debridement may reduce mortality and the need for repeated drainage procedures in patients with pancreatic abscess, but the detection and treatment of persisting sepsis remains the major problem.\r"

The patients were treated with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and 5-fluorouracil (CAF), with or without tamoxifen. There was no difference in response rate, response duration, time to treatment failure, or survival between patients who had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy and those who had not. The addition of tamoxifen to CAF failed to enhance response rates or response durations in all subgroups. Women who relapsed 6 months or more after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy did not have inherently drug-resistant tumors. They responded to standard CAF chemotherapy with the same response rate and survival as patients untreated previously with chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Breast cancer proliferative capacity as determined by the DNA thymidine labeling index, along with estrogen and progesterone receptor status, is highly predictive for risk of relapse and overall survival. Recently, DNA ploidy and proliferative capacity (S-phase fraction [SPF]) as determined by flow cytometry have also shown significant prognostic value. The authors have developed a technique which allows a 50 to 100 mg aliquot of the same frozen breast tumor specimen routinely employed in steroid receptor assays, to be assayed for both DNA ploidy and SPF by flow cytometry. Of the 1331 tumors examined, DNA histograms were evaluable for ploidy in 89% (1184) of specimens examined; 57% of these were aneuploid. Adapting a trapezoidal model to estimate SPF in both diploid and aneuploid tumors, the authors found 81% (1084) to be evaluable for SPF, with a median SPF of 5.8% for the entire population. The median SPF was significantly lower in diploid tumors (2.6%) than in aneuploid tumors (10.3%, P less than 0.0001). Both aneuploidy and high SPF were strongly associated with absence of steroid receptors. Aneuploid tumors showed more striking differences in the frequency of high S-phase values with respect to receptor status and age or menopausal status, whereas diploid but not aneuploid tumors showed lower SPF in node-negative versus node-positive patients. Because it is particularly important to identify the high-risk minority of node-negative patients, the authors examined the node-negative group separately. High SPF subgroups appeared in each category of receptor status and age or menopausal status within the node-negative group, suggesting that SPF will be an independent prognostic factor. With the DNA flow cytometric methods used here, it is now practical to determine ploidy and SPF for nearly every breast cancer patient. These factors, which show associations with established prognostic factors, such as receptor status can now be fully evaluated for their prognostic significance in broad patient populations.\r"

Patients received multiple clinical neurologic examinations and psychological evaluations, as well as diagnostic imaging studies, to monitor the efficacy of chemotherapy and toxic effects of therapy. Six of the eight children with residual tumor evident postoperatively on computed tomography scans had objective responses to chemotherapy. The efficacy of chemotherapy was further demonstrated by the lack of disease progression for 7 months or longer in eight children, seven of whom remain free of tumor 19 to 57 months (median, 28 months) from the date of diagnosis. The neurologic status of ten patients improved during treatment. Developmental progress was normal in two, low average in three, and frankly deficient in four of ten children formally evaluated. These results indicate that postoperative chemotherapy, added to a regimen of surgical resection and delayed irradiation, prolong survival with only minimal short term neurotoxicity in the majority of very young children with malignant brain tumors.\r"

The patients were randomized to receive either follow-up alone or \"maintenance\" chemotherapy with 2 years of intermittent chlorambucil. A complete remission was obtained in 56% of patients and the median survival was 64 months (median follow-up, 74 months). Multivariate analysis revealed stage (P less than 0.0001) and Karnofsky performance status (P = 0.021) to predict complete response (CR) and the achievement of a CR (P less than 0.0001), female sex (P = 0.008), the absence of bulk disease (P = 0.038) and low serum alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.002) to predict prolonged survival. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) of the complete responders was 41 months. A prolonged RFS was predicted by low stage (P = 0.014), low serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = 0.045) levels, and by the administration of maintenance chlorambucil (P = 0.045). A prolonged survival of the complete responders was predicted by a low number of nodal sites of involvement with lymphoma at presentation (P = 0.022) and lack of liver involvement (P = 0.011). The administration of oral maintenance therapy with chlorambucil for a full 2 years was only possible in 38% of patients, mainly because of progression of disease and the induction of thrombocytopaenia, but despite this it prolonged the median RFS by 38 months and its use could be considered when future studies are being designed.\r"

Major symptoms were gross hematuria (78%) and irritative voiding symptoms (45%). Microhematuria developed in 93% of patients. Hemorrhagic cystitis developed at significantly lower doses and shorter durations of therapy in patients treated intravenously than in patients treated orally. Cystectomy was required in nine patients and bladder cancer developed in five. Urine cytologic study, urinalysis, and cystoscopy are important in the diagnosis of hemorrhagic cystitis, and these studies plus periodic excretory urography are important for surveillance.

The overall 3-year no evidence of disease (NED) survival rate was 44%. The 3-year NED survival rate with radium implant was 86%. We cannot comment on anaplastic transformation after radiotherapy because our treatment failures have not been subjected for biopsy concerning this matter.

The authors have sought to determine the role of PGE2-releasing monocytes-macrophages in this immune depression by determining the effects of adherent cell depletion and by measuring the effects of indomethacin, a PGE2 synthetase inhibitor, on selected tests of lymphocyte function. Lymphocyte stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (T-cell stimulant) and Staph phage lysate (SPL) (B-cell stimulant) was done in the presence of varying concentrations of indomethacin; the effect of adherent cell depletion also was determined. The study population included 45 patients with localized or locoregional squamous CA of the H&N and 40 controls. Results included the following: (1) lymphocyte stimulation responses to PHA and SPL were generally depressed in the CA patients versus controls; (2) incubation with indomethacin produced bivalent effects in both controls and CA patients, depending on the concentration of indomethacin and lymphocyte stimulant; incubation with optimum concentrations of indomethacin generally produced augmented responses in both study groups whereas high concentrations of indomethacin were suppressive; (3) the immune potentiating effects were not observed in older patients with advanced disease; and (4) removal of adherent leukocytes (mainly monocytes) also restored depressed lymphocyte responses. Although other factors also are operative, our data suggest that PGE2-secreting monocytes-macrophages may have a major role in the immune depression of H&N CA patients. Age and host effects of the cancer and the malnutrition common to these patients probably are involved also, although their singular contribution has not been measured. This depression is largely reversible by a PGE2 synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin, which suggests the potential value of in vivo administration of indomethacin to H&N CA patients as an adjunct.\r"

  ".W": "Hybrid crosses were performed between SWR/J, a strain highly sensitive to 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), and AKR/J, a strain highly resistant to the carcinogen. F1 and F2 and reciprocal backcrosses were tested to determine if proliferative characteristics such as high activity, wide compartment (PC), and a large S-phase population in the middle third of crypts were linked to susceptibility and inherited as a dominant autosomal trait as was reported for DMH tumor response. A blend of resistant and sensitive tumor and proliferative characteristics was observed in the F1 and F2 crosses. A tumor incidence of 43.7% in the F1 and 52% in the F2 was obtained rather than the respective 100% and 75% expected frequencies. One week after the sixth injection of DMH, the incidence of focal areas of atypism (FAA) in the backcross to resistance (BCR) and the backcross to sensitivity (BCS) was the same (4.1 per FAA-bearing animal). This suggested that the response to the carcinogen was similar in both groups up to this point. Yet 20 weeks later, the BCR had a 7.3% tumor incidence, far lower than the 50% incidence expected. The BCS had an incidence of 98.6%, not unlike SWR frequencies and close to the expected 100% tumor incidence. Proliferative characteristics in the backcrosses, however, did not revert to parental levels. Instead, the labeling index (LI) or percentage of S-phase cells to total cells scored was significantly higher in the BCR than in the BCS (10.2% +/- 3.2% versus 8.1% +/- 2.2%, P less than 0.02). This study has shown that in crosses between these two strains (SWR/J and AKR/J), susceptibility to DMH-induced tumor is not inherited as a dominant trait. Neither are the proliferative characteristics of the colonic mucosa inherited in a simple Mendelian manner nor are the kinetic properties of the epithelial cells linked to DMH tumor susceptibility. It is suggested that the parental AKR/J strain may contribute a protective or resistant factor, that is, a repressor gene, which impedes the progression of carcinogen-induced foci of dysplasia to colonic neoplasia.\r"

HBL-1 and HBL-2 showed the characteristics of activated B-cells in B-cell lineage, as did original lymphoma cells. Chromosome analyses revealed that HBL-1 exhibiting 14q+ marker-positive lymphoid cancer showed a new subclass of 14q32 translocation resulting from a translocation between chromosomes 14 and 16, which had been masked in a complex translocation involving five chromosomes, and that HBL-2 had a 14q+ marker chromosome, the result of an 11;14 translocation [t(11;14)(q13;32)]. Successful heterotransplantation into athymic nude mice demonstrated tumorigenicity of HBL-1 and HBL-2. The transplantability and tumor growth rate of HBL-2 were higher and more rapid than those of HBL-1. HBL-1 and HBL-2 appear useful for facilitating therapeutic investigations as well as immunologic and oncogenic studies in B-cell lymphomas.\r"

The demonstration of AChE and BuChE activities in only two of nine cases of follicular and papillary carcinoma examined and none of the three cases of medullary carcinoma shows that the cholinesterases are not specific enzymes for the thyroid tumors. In normal thyroid tissue samples examined, no activities of AChE and BuChE were detected. On ultrastructural level AChE reaction product was revealed in the perinuclear space, in the endoplasmic reticulum, and in the Golgi complex of some but not in all cells in less-differentiated regions of the tumors. In contrast to the distribution of AChE, no staining for BuChE was noted in the Golgi elements. Ultrastructural localization of AChE activity in the thyroid cancer cells corresponds exactly to the current understanding of glycoproteins synthesis and processing in normal cells. The authors postulate that the copy of AChE gene suppressed in normal thyroid epithelium cells may be expressed in some follicular thyroid carcinoma cells. Their hypothesis is logical on the basis of recent finding of a significant homology between AChE and thyroglobulin.\r"

None of the antibodies significantly stained the cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which were a distinct morphologic feature of this fibromatosis. This result is in contrast to a previous report that stated that the inclusions were composed chiefly of actin filaments. In ultrastructural term, the tumor cells were morphologically consistent with cells in myofibroblasts. The inclusions consisted of packed fibrillar and granular substances. Cultured cells containing inclusions identical to those seen in the original tumor mimicked a growth pattern in vivo. Scanning electron microscopy showed that cultured cells had thin foot processes containing many microspikes. Detergent-treated preparations examined by transmission electron microscopy displayed a microtrabecular meshwork characterized by three, major cytoskeletal domains with many actin cables. Cultured cells showed a normal karyotype.\r"

  ".U": "88109232\r", 
  ".W": "Eighty-nine primary lung carcinomas and 23 metastatic lung tumors were immunohistochemically studied for the expression of pulmonary surfactant apoproteins, by using monoclonal (PE-10) and polyclonal antibodies. Surfactant apoprotein was demonstrated in the cytoplasm and/or nuclear inclusion bodies of only primary lung adenocarcinomas (36 of 75 cases), not in any other histologic type of primary lung carcinoma or in metastatic lung tumors. In primary lung adenocarcinoma, although typical type II pneumocyte type adenocarcinoma was not included in the current series, the majority of surfactant apoprotein-positive single cell type tumors were of the Clara cell type, with a single bronchial surface epithelial cell type, according to the light microscopic subclassification of adenocarcinoma cells. The Clara cell type adenocarcinomas could at times be distinguished only with difficulty from adenocarcinoma of type II pneumocyte type. Normal and hyperplastic type II pneumocytes were of course positive for surfactant apoprotein in the cytoplasm. However, none of the positive cells could definitely be identified as Clara cells in non-neoplastic lungs. The findings obtained in this study indicate that surfactant apoprotein is a good marker to distinguish adenocarcinoma of the lung from other histologic types of lung cancer and from neoplasms metastatic to the lung, and that type II pneumocytes and Clara cells, non-neoplastic and neoplastic, are morphologically and functionally closely related and might belong to the same cell lineage.\r"

A tumor developed in the contralateral ovary in one patient 2 years after unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Three patients had pelvic recurrences between 7 months and 3 years, but all of them were successfully treated and none have died.

In the younger age groups (36 to 60 years) atypical hyperplasia was found in 86.8% of prostates with carcinoma, but only in 37.9% of benign glands. Corresponding figures for the over-60 age group were 68.8% and 65.1%, respectively. A biologic explanation of the association between atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in the younger age groups has been proposed. It was suggested that these men with atypical hyperplasia, particularly with severe atypical hyperplasia, have a greater risk for developing prostatic carcinoma.\r"

In a 51-year-old man, an antral adenoma that measured 13 mm in diameter and had an irregular central depression did not change in size or morphology during 4 years and 1 month, but malignant change was evident at the time of endoscopic biopsy. The findings indicate that in patients with this disease, gastric adenomas require careful repeated follow-up examinations using endoscopic biopsy and, if feasible, endoscopic removal is recommended.\r"

The overall annual incidence rate per 100,000 persons was 2.6 for squamous cell carcinoma and 0.4 for adenocarcinoma. The sex ratio for adenocarcinoma varied from one age group to the next and was highest in the 50- to 59-year-old group. It was relatively the same for squamous cell carcinoma. The male-to-female ratio was higher for adenocarcinoma (seven in whites and 10 in blacks) than for squamous cell carcinoma (three and four, respectively). The highest sex-specific ratio for adenocarcinoma occurred in the lower third of the esophagus. Blacks had a fourfold to fivefold higher rate of squamous cell carcinoma than whites, but the rate of adenocarcinoma in blacks was 30% of the rate in whites. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma in black men and women increased by approximately 30% between 1973 and 1982, and the rate of adenocarcinoma among white men increased 74%. Nearly half of the squamous cell carcinomas occurred in the middle of the esophagus, whereas the majority (79%) of the adenocarcinomas arose in the lower third. These data suggest that the two major histologic types of esophageal cancer may be of different etiologic origin.\r"

No study has yet reported on cholecystectomy and adenomatous polyps, a precursor lesion for most colon cancers. This pilot case-control study interviewed 245 women who had undergone colonoscopy between 1983 and 1985 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center with a structured telephone-administered questionnaire. Fifty-six were colon cancer cases, 105 were adenomatous polyp (AP) cases, and 84 were controls (without colonic neoplasia). Adjusted for age and educational attainment, the odds ratio for prior cholecystectomy among colon cancer cases compared to controls was 1.79 (95% confidence limits, 0.59 to 5.44) and 2.26 for right-sided colon cancer cases (95% confidence limits, 0.61 to 8.42). Despite a lack of statistical power, these estimates are consistent with earlier reports. The odds ratio for adenomatous polyp cases was 1.02 (95% confidence limits, 0.40 to 2.64), suggesting no association between prior cholecystectomy and adenomatous polyps. These preliminary findings are currently being explored in a large-scale case-control study.\r"

Nine patients with Stage I or II disease received definitive treatment consisting of 6000 cGy in 6 to 7 weeks and 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/24 hours) as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for 96 hours starting on days 2 and 29. Mitomycin (10 mg/m2) was administered as a bolus injection on day 2. Ten patients with extraesophageal and disseminated disease (Stages III and IV) and one patient with an unresectable anastomotic recurrence were considered palliative. Generally the palliative regimen did not differ from the definitive except for the radiation dose which in seven of the 11 patients was less than 6000 cGy (4000-5600 cGy). The range of follow-up was 6 to 74 months and no patient was lost to follow-up. Seven of the eight evaluable definitively treated patients were complete responders. The median relapse-free survival was 10 months and the median survival was 15 months in this group. In the palliative group, six of nine evaluable patients had relief of dysphagia until death or last follow-up with a median duration of 8 months. Our results indicate that combined modality treatment with infusional 5-FU, mitomycin, and radiation is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. This treatment regimen offers palliation and some chance for cure to those patients who are inoperable, unresectable, or who refuse surgery.\r"

The charts of 106 consecutive patients laryngectomized for recurrence in the years 1975 to 1984 were examined. Thirty-four patients developed a fistula. An evaluation of the different radiotherapy schedules used during this period allowed a dose-response curve to be constructed. It showed a pronounced increase of fistulae with high doses of radiotherapy. Split-course radiotherapy caused a rise in late complications and did not improve tumor control. Large field sizes increased the number of fistulae. High-dose fractions showed a surprisingly high incidence of late complications. Prophylactic metronidazole (introduced in 1980) resulted in a highly significant decrease in the frequency of postoperative fistulae. Patients in whom fistula formed were hospitalized for an average of 54 days, patients without, for 22 days.\r"

  ".W": "Using data from the population-based Danish Cancer Registry, the relative risk (RR) of second primary cancer was assessed among 24,970 women with invasive cervical cancer (1943-1982) and 19,470 women with carcinoma in situ of the cervix. The analysis was stratified according to treatment with (+) and without (-) radiation. For all second primaries combined, a RR+ = 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-1.18) and a RR- = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.13-1.40) was observed after invasive cervical cancers and a RR+ = 3.5 (95% CI = 1.4-7.2) and RR- = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.7-1.6) following in situ cancer. The small overall excess of second primary cancer is accounted for by an increase of some cancers such as lung, bladder, and a concurrent decrease in others such as breast. Although not statistically different from nonirradiated, the RR increased with time since treatment among irradiated invasive cervical cancer patients in organs close to and at intermediate distance from the cervix, reaching a maximum after 30 or more years of follow-up (RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.4-2.5). Altogether, for these sites an excess of 64 cases per 10,000 women per year were attributable to radiation among survivors of 30+ years. The highest risks among long-term survivors were observed for the following: other genital organs (RR = 5.8; 95% CI = 1.8-13.0) bladder (RR = 5.5; 95% CI = 2.8-9.5), connective tissue (RR = 3.3; 95% CI = 0.4-12.0), stomach (RR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.1-4.7) and rectum (RR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.1-4.6). A significant deficit of risk for breast cancer (RR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.6-0.8) was observed for 10+ years, may be attributable to the effect of ovarian ablation by radiotherapy. It is speculated that the same effect also may explain the observed deficits of brain tumors (RR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4-1.0) and skin melanomas (RR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.3-1.0). It is concluded that cancers attributable to radiation, apart from acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, tend to appear late (10 or more years after radiotherapy), and that the risk remains elevated for more than 30 years.\r"

Five patients who experienced recurrent bladder tumors for more than 5 years without any malignant progression were served as control. ABH-antigens in initial tumors were negative in only two of 13 patients developing malignant progression and in two of five controls. Cryptic T-Ag was positive in all patients examined. Recurrent tumors revealed eliminated or decreased expression of ABH-antigens and cryptic T-Ag before malignant progression in, respectively, ten of 11 and six of nine patients with antigen-positive initial tumors. In contrast, recurrent tumor of controls with antigen-positive initial tumors showed neither elimination nor decrease in expression of antigens throughout their clinical courses.\r"

  ".W": "Cholinesterases were characterized in the serum of 77 treated and 11 untreated patients having primary carcinomas of various tissue origins and 21 healthy volunteers which served as controls. In most of the samples, pseudocholinesterase (BuChE) accounted for almost all cholinesterase (ChE) activity and was inhibited by the organophosphorous poison tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide (iso-OMPA). In samples from the tumor-bearing patients, ChE degraded 733 +/- 59 nmole acetylcholine/h/mg protein, lower than the 960 +/- 175 nmole/hour/mg levels measured in controls. Tumor serum ChE exhibited elevated sensitivity to 1,5-bis-(4-allyldimethyl ammonium phenyl)-pentan-3-one dibromide (BW), the selective bisquaternary inhibitor of \"true\" acetylcholinesterase (AChE), with no correlation to age, sex, staging of tumor, presence of metastases or the specific treatment protocol, and with a different distribution pattern from the decrease in ChE specific activity or the sensitivity to iso-OMPA. In sucrose gradients, ChE sedimented as 12S in controls whereas in tumor serum samples from treated patients an additional component of 6 to 7 S, inhibited by both iso-OMPA and BW, also was detected. However, the ChE activity in serum of patients with diagnosed carcinomas before surgery and medical treatment appeared to be nondistinguishable from controls. These findings suggest that the modified properties of serum cholinesterases in carcinoma patients are not the result of the tumor itself, but that the common therapy protocols used in the treatment of primary carcinomas may cause the appearance of soluble ChE activity with properties of both AChE and BuChE, which accumulates in the serum.\r"

Natural killer (NK) cells, representing non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted, spontaneous cytotoxicity and monocytic cells are virtually absent in infiltrates of gliomas and account only for a minor percentage of inflammatory cells in brain metastases of carcinoma and in craniopharyngeomas. Infiltrates in gliomas consist almost exclusively of T-cells of the suppressor/cytotoxic type whereas infiltrates in carcinoma metastases and craniopharyngeomas contain considerable numbers of T-helper/inducer cells and B-cells. From this the authors conclude (1) that NK cells do not play a major role in tumor rejection, and (2) that the kind of inflammatory reaction does not depend upon the tumor site but more likely on the tumor type. No correlation between tumor differentiation and infiltrate composition is evident.\r"

All patients received a standard treatment (a combination of maximum debulking of medulloblastoma and postoperative craniospinal irradiation with a posterior fossa boost of 5000 rad or more). They were studied to correlate the results of the findings of FCM DNA analysis with their final outcome, DNA ploidy, and extent of tumor resection. All seven patients with totally resected aneuploid medulloblastoma are alive, whereas only one of six patients with subtotally resected diploid medulloblastoma is alive (P = 0.0047). The current study suggests both DNA ploidy and extent of surgical resection are the most important determinant of patients' prognosis. Patients in selected group, particularly those with subtotally resected diploid tumor, are advised to undergo aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen and progestin receptor levels (ER and PgR) in tumors from 506 patients with primary breast cancer diagnosed in 1979, 1980, and 1981 were measured by a Scatchard plot analysis. At a median follow-up time of 3.5 years the prognostic value of the receptor levels was evaluated and compared with other tumor and patient characteristics. No relation was found between receptor levels and tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) classification or location of the primary tumor. A significant positive rank correlation was observed between ER and PgR levels (rs = 0.57) and between ER level and age of the patients (rs = 0.39, P less than 0.001). The observed association between ER level and menopause status could not be maintained after correction for age. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were tumor size (P = 0.002), the number of positive lymph nodes (P less than 0.001), age at primary surgery (P less than 0.001), the PgR level of the tumor (P less than 0.001), but not ER level. Independent prognostic factors for relapse were tumor size (P = 0.003), number of positive lymph nodes (P less than 0.001), age (P = 0.006), menopause status (P = 0.02), PgR level (P = 0.007), but not ER level. Finally, for death rate after relapse the following prognosticators were identified: size of the primary tumor (P = 0.03), number of positive lymph nodes (P = 0.03), age (P = 0.003), site of relapse (P less than 0.001), ER level (P = 0.02), and PgR level (P = 0.04). Patients with tumors containing low positive PgR levels (10 to 20 fmol/mg protein) had a slightly better prognosis than patients with PgR-negative tumors. It is concluded that the PgR level of the primary tumor is a better prognosticator than the ER level. The ER offered no additional ability for discriminating between low- and high-risk patients once PgR was included in the model. In contrast, PgR was capable of improving on the discriminating ability of ER. In addition, patients with tumors containing both PgR and ER showed the best prognosis. Therefore, it is recommended that ER and PgR should be assayed in all breast cancer biopsies.\r"

All the patients had been operated on with a wide or radical surgical margin. Male sex, histologic malignancy Grade IV, extensive tumor necrosis, and tumor size greater than 10 cm were identified as risk factors. Patients with no or one risk factor had a 6(10)-year survival rate of 100% (100%), equal to 96% (96%) in a group with Grade I and Grade II tumors operated on with the same margin. These two groups comprised 50% of all the patients operated on with a wide or radical margin. The 6(10)-year survival rate decreased to 75% (75%) for patients with two risk factors and to 33% (22%) for patients with three or four risk factors. The risk factor model also applied to 62 patients operated on with marginal surgery; and for patients with three or four risk factors, more extensive surgery only had a small effect on long-term survival. The model could be of value when eligibility criteria for trials with adjunctive chemotherapy are determined.\r"

Three early minute cancers (3-5 mm in diameter) were detected in the apparently normal mucosa, and two cancers in the adenoma (focal cancer in adenomatous polyp). The three early cancers had no evidence of preexisting adenoma, so they were considered to be de novo cancers. In form they were depressed, flat, and slightly elevated. In humans, de novo cancer has an important significance in histogenesis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Clinically, it is also important to recognize the early phase of colorectal cancer in flat type as well as polypoid type.\r"

Of the 93 patients younger than 40 years of age (3.6%), 78 records were retrospectively studied. The overall 5-year survival rate was 30%. Their survival was not significantly affected by the site of the primary tumor, the degree of tumor differentiation, or sex. The only significant parameter was Dukes' staging at presentation (P less than 0.0001). An analysis of sites of recurrence revealed the frequency of liver metastasis, ovarian metastasis in women, and local recurrence of rectal cancer. Although the high failure rate in these areas clearly justifies aggressive combined therapy, the high frequency of inaugural Stage D patients (27%) and their short mean survival time (5 months), underline the crucial importance of early detection. However, it is unfortunate that colorectal cancer screening in young patients is difficult because of the low rates of precancerous states (4%).\r"
