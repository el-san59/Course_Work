  ".W": "From 1972 to 1984, 47 children and adolescents with primary tumors of the female genital tract were treated with eight different Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS I-II) protocols. These included patients with vaginal (28), uterine (ten), or vulval (nine) rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcomas. The mean age of patients with primary vaginal tumors was younger than 2 years. All were of the embryonal histologic subtype. The majority of these patients were treated with initial chemotherapy (vincristine, dactinomycin, +/- cyclophosphamide, +/- Adriamycin [(ADR) doxorubicin]) followed by delayed hysterectomy and/or partial vaginectomy. Among 26 patients with localized vaginal tumors, there have been six relapses resulting in one tumor-related death and one therapy-related death. The five patients with nonfatal relapse have been disease-free for from 2.5 to 6.5 years (mean, 4.4 years) since salvage therapy was commenced. The 19 patients without relapse have been continuously disease-free for 1.5 to 12 years (mean, 5.34 years: median, 6 years). No patient that received ADR initially relapsed. Ten patients, with a mean age greater than 13 years, had primary uterine sarcomas and were treated by the same chemotherapy regimens. Six with polypoid localized lesions, removed before chemotherapy, have remained disease-free for 2.5 to 6.5 years. Four, with more extensive local lesions or disseminated disease, treated with chemotherapy only, died 2 to 11 months from diagnosis. Nine patients with rhabdomyosarcomas of the vulva (age, 1-19 years) were managed by the same chemotherapy regimens +/- radiotherapy. Resection was carried out initially or after chemotherapy. Eight of these have been disease-free from 4 to 10 years (mean, 6.4 years); and one is alive with probable disease at 2.5 years.\r"

In Group I isoflurane was used to maintain anaesthesia and induce hypotension. Mean PE fell significantly during hypotension and remained reduced after hypotension, mean PNE remained unchanged, while mean PRA rose slightly but not significantly during hypotension, falling again after hypotension. In Group II halothane was used to maintain anaesthesia and sodium nitroprusside to induce hypotension. During anaesthesia and surgical stimulation PNE and PRA were significantly greater compared to Group I. Mean PE, PNE and PRA all rose during hypotension and remained elevated after hypotension. The rise in PNE and PRA was statistically significant. After hypotension the MAP in Group II was significantly higher when compared to Group I. There was no significant change in HR during the study in either group. In conclusion, isoflurane-induced hypotension with isoflurane anaesthesia unlike sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension with halothane anaesthesia attenuated the stress response.\r"

  ".U": "88184768\r", 
  ".W": "The efficacy of prophylactic intravenous infusion of indomethacin as a postoperative analgesic was studied in 100 children aged one to 16 years. At the end of surgery a bolus dose of indomethacin 0.35 mg.kg-1 followed by an infusion 0.07 mg.kg-1.hr-1 for 24 hr or placebo was given in double-blind manner. The efficacy of the treatment was measured by the need of additional morphine given 0.1 mg.kg-1 intravenously in the Recovery Room and 0.15 mg.kg-1 intramuscularly on the ward according to clinical needs. The other measure of the efficacy was assessment of pain intensity in the Recovery Room and pain relief on the ward. In the Recovery Room the pain scores differed between the groups in advantage of indomethacin only at 30 minutes (p less than 0.05) but the need of morphine was significantly less (p less than 0.01) in the indomethacin group. On the ward the mean doses of morphine given and the nurses' pain relief scores were not different between the study groups. However, in the indomethacin group the total dose of morphine given during 24 hr was lower (p = 0.02) and the children assessed the pain relief to be significantly better (p less than 0.02). Twenty per cent of the children in both groups had transient nausea and vomiting. No skin reactions or other allergic manifestations were observed. Prophylactic indomethacin infusion diminished the need of morphine and resulted in better postoperative analgesia than morphine p.r.n. alone.\r"

  ".U": "88184772\r", 
  ".W": "There have been conflicting reports of the value of naloxone infusions to prevent the side-effects associated with epidural morphine. In our study, 29 patients undergoing thoracotomies for pulmonary surgery received epidural morphine (0.1 mg.kg-1) shortly after induction of anaesthesia. One hour after arrival in the Recovery Room, one of four naloxone bolus and infusion sequences was administered: saline bolus followed by saline infusion; 0.4 microgram.kg-1 naloxone bolus followed by 0.4 microgram.kg-1.hr-1 naloxone infusion; 2.0 micrograms.kg-1 naloxone bolus followed by 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 naloxone infusion; and 4.0 micrograms.kg-1 naloxone bolus followed by 4.0 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 naloxone infusion. Although with the number of patients studied, there were no statistically significant differences among groups, clinically, there was a trend toward decreased analgesia with all three naloxone infusion doses as determined by analgesic requirements, longest analgesic-free period and visual analogue pain scores. In addition, side-effects occurred in all groups. We conclude that prophylactic naloxone, used in this manner, is not an appropriate technique for the prevention of side-effects associated with epidural morphine used for the prevention of pain after thoracotomy.\r"

Pain relief and side effects were recorded for 6 hours. Patients reported significantly more relief after clonidine than after the other three treatments. Codeine and ibuprofen were ineffective. Sedation, dizziness, and other side effects were more frequent after clonidine (74%) or codeine (69%) than after placebo (36%) or ibuprofen (28%). Reported pain relief was greater during trials in which side effects were present. A single, mild side effect was associated with as much additional pain relief as multiple, severe side effects. Clonidine's superiority to codeine, which had a similar incidence of side effects, argues for a specific analgesic effect. In addition, side effects may have contributed to clonidine analgesia, perhaps by suggesting to patients that they had received a potent drug.\r"

There was no significant change from placebo in the dose of methacholine required to produce a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) (PD20); the fold increase in PD20 from baseline was 1.1 +/- 0.1 after placebo, 1.4 +/- 0.2 after 5 mg, 1.8 +/- 0.3 after 10 mg, 1.4 +/- 0.2 after 15 mg, 1.6 +/- 0.2 after 30 mg, and 1.2 +/- 0.1 after 60 mg. There was a 1% chance that we missed a twofold difference between placebo and the 10 mg dose because of inadequate sample size. Fifteen minutes before a standardized exercise challenge, 10 subjects received placebo, 10 mg, and the highest dose tolerated during the methacholine study (20 to 45 mg) in a randomized double-blind crossover design. The mean +/- SE maximum postexercise decrease in FEV1 was 28.8% +/- 5.7% after placebo, 23.4% +/- 4.6% after 10 mg, and 20.8% +/- 3.0% after high-dose diltiazem (P greater than 0.05). There was a 12% chance that we missed a 15% difference between placebo and the high-dose regimen because of inadequate sample size.

Oral verapamil alone at a dose of 80 mg three times daily, or 40 mg of verapamil three times daily in combination with 0.25 mg of digoxin daily, was superior to digoxin alone in doses associated with high serum digoxin concentrations (mean +/- SEM 1.6 +/- 0.3 micrograms/l). This superiority manifested as greater control of heart rate during work rates equivalent to regular daily activities, and was not associated with deterioration in left ventricular function or worsening nocturnal bradycardia. 4.

The high sensitivity of chromogenic detection allowed measurement of endotoxin as low as 10 to 15 pg per ml, an order of magnitude greater than previously possible by gelation studies. Group 1 consisted of 56 patients with cirrhosis undergoing angiographic evaluation. In this group, there was wide variability in hepatic venous concentration [73 +/- 110 pg per ml (mean +/- S.D.)] and peripheral venous concentration [31 +/- 58 pg per ml]. However, paired t test showed peripheral venous concentration was significantly (p less than 0.001) lower than hepatic venous concentration. Neither hepatic or peripheral venous endotoxin levels correlated significantly with a variety of clinical, biochemical or radiological parameters. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients with cirrhosis undergoing shunt surgery. Endotoxin levels again showed a wide range, with portal venous concentration (142 +/- 167 pg per ml) and simultaneous peripheral venous concentration (82 +/- 150 pg per ml). Paired t test in this group showed a significant (p less than 0.001) portal to peripheral venous gradient. This study showed the feasibility of measuring endotoxin in plasma to low concentrations by a chromogenic assay technique. It supports the concept of relatively high levels of endotoxin in the portal circulation. In the presence of liver disease, systemic endotoxemia occurs, which is augmented by stressful situations.\r"

Two structurally unrelated thromboxane synthetase inhibitors, OKY 1581 and benzyl imidazole, were also examined in order to investigate the role of the prostacyclin-thromboxane balance in the development of hepatic lesions. Whereas prostacyclin or OKY 1581 given shortly after acetaminophen prevented mortality and reduced liver necrosis, as assessed by serum ALT activity and histology, benzyl imidazole was only effective if given prior to acetaminophen. Acetaminophen overdose resulted in an enhanced prostaglandin and thromboxane generation by liver homogenates. While OKY 1581 inhibited thromboxane production by the liver homogenates, prostacyclin synthesis was increased. Pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin blocked both the increase in prostacyclin generation and the protective effect of OKY 1581. Benzyl imidazole inhibited the synthesis of thromboxane but did not enhance prostacyclin production. In addition, the protective effect of benzyl imidazole was unaltered by indomethacin pretreatment. Furthermore, whereas benzyl imidazole interfered with hepatic drug metabolism, as assessed by prolongation of the pentobarbitone sleeping time, prostacyclin and OKY 1581 were without activity. Prostacyclin treatment can prevent acetaminophen-induced liver necrosis in mice. Enhanced prostacyclin synthesis by the selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor OKY 1581 also exerts a protective role in this model.\r"

  ".W": "Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils, when exposed to soluble or particulate stimuli, can destroy various types of cells. The aim of this study was to investigate their toxicity against hepatocytes. Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils were incubated in basal conditions and after stimulation with 5 mg per ml opsonized zymosan in the presence of rat hepatocytes isolated by collagenase digestion. Cytotoxicity was quantified by the percentage of ALT activity released by hepatocytes in culture medium. Whereas unstimulated neutrophils exhibited only minor effects, opsonized zymosan-stimulated neutrophils induced, after 16 hr incubation, a 24.0 +/- 4.1% (mean +/- 1 S.E.) ALT activity release at a neutrophil/hepatocyte ratio of 5, and a 51.7 +/- 6.8% ALT activity release at a ratio of 20. At this ratio of 20, the ALT activity release was 9.0% at 1 hr and 24.0% at 4 hr. Three proteinase inhibitors (i.e., soybean trypsin inhibitor, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and fetal calf serum) decrease cytotoxicity by 78, 76 and 78%, respectively. The protective effect of proteinase inhibitors was not due to a nonspecific effect of proteins, since bovine serum albumin did not decrease the toxicity of stimulated polymorphonuclear cells. The supernatant of stimulated neutrophils was also found to be toxic against hepatocytes, and again, this effect was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and fetal calf serum. Finally, the role of proteinases was supported by the demonstration of a cytotoxic effect of two purified proteinases: porcine pancreatic elastase and human neutrophil cathepsin G. The toxicity of these proteinases was also markedly reduced by the specific inhibitors used in the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In efforts to understand mechanisms of liver dysfunction in cirrhosis, transcription of specific genes important to liver function has been measured in the rat model of CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis. The relative transcription rates of albumin, alpha-fetoprotein and pro-alpha 1-collagen genes were studied during development of fibrosis and after fibrosis was established. During the initial phase of CCl4 administration, there was a decrease in albumin transcription associated with increased alpha-fetoprotein transcription, indicative of active liver regeneration. However, later during development of fibrosis, the response pattern of these genes was different, as albumin gene transcription was normal or increased and alpha-fetoprotein gene transcription was no longer increased. Three weeks after completion of CCl4 treatment (fully established cirrhosis), albumin genes responded normally or hypernormally to an acute regenerative stimulus, but the alpha-fetoprotein gene was again not measurably responsive. Pro-alpha 1-collagen gene transcription increased during the entire fibrogenic process and remained elevated after cirrhosis was established. These studies suggest that a switch from albumin to alpha-fetoprotein gene transcription can serve as a marker of liver regenerative capacity, and that this process is altered during and after development of hepatic fibrosis. The fibrogenic process is also associated with elevated transcription of collagen genes.\r"

Fifteen patients (83%) presented with neonatal cholestatic jaundice at a mean age of 2 +/- 0.6 months (+/- S.D.). The male:female ratio was 15:3, indicating a male predominance. All metabolic, infectious and obstructive causes of jaundice were ruled out by appropriate tests in the patients with neonatal cholestasis. Liver biopsy in 14 patients with neonatal cholestasis showed a histological picture of cholestasis in all biopsies; neonatal giant cell hepatitis appeared in seven, increased fibrosis in appeared five and established liver cirrhosis appeared in two biopsies. Patients were followed for a mean of 3.7 +/- 2.4 years (+/- S.D.). Of the 15 patients with neonatal cholestasis, 3 under went liver transplantation because of decompensated liver cirrhosis at 3, 3 1/2 and 7 years. Two patients died at 4 months and 3 years from complications of liver cirrhosis. Of the remaining 10 patients, 3 had histological evidence of liver cirrhosis, and the remaining 7 patients continue to have enlarged liver and spleen with abnormal liver function tests. Of the three patients without history of neonatal cholestasis, only one had enlarged liver and spleen, and the remaining two are healthy with normal liver function tests. Our experience indicates serious liver disease is highly likely to develop in patients with PiZZ alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency who present with neonatal cholestatic jaundice. Our experience differs from more recent reports on such patients.\r"

The right and left lobes of the fetal liver are perfused by vascular systems carrying different concentrations of oxygen and constitute distinct functional units. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of the phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 b,e genes in hepatocytes of the right and left fetal liver lobes in mice. Northern-blot analysis using [32P]cDNAs and quantitative dot-blot hybridization were performed to assess the size and levels of these mRNAs in the right and left fetal liver lobes. In fetal mice, the levels of cytochrome P-450, b,e mRNAs were higher in the left than in the right fetal liver lobe. During the last days of gestation and in the immediate postnatal period, the levels of liver cytochrome P-450 b,e mRNAs increased predominantly in the left liver lobe. In contrast, the levels of albumin and alpha-fetoprotein mRNAs (genes studied to assess the specificity of these findings) were similar in each of functional units of the fetal liver. Phenobarbital induction of cytochromes P-450 b,e mRNAs was not observed in either of the fetal liver lobes. Postnatally, phenobarbital induced these cytochromes similarly in the right and left liver lobes. Therefore, the microenvironment surrounding fetal hepatocytes seems to influence the expression of the cytochrome P-450 b,e genes. This lobar heterogeneity of expression disappears as the pattern of adult liver circulation is attained.\r"

Diabetic rats showed hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, but no significant changes in hematocrit, plasma protein concentration or plasma osmolality. Bile flow was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced (-23%) as compared with control animals, despite a higher (p less than 0.05) bile acid secretion rate (+56%). The biliary responses to three choleretic compounds (taurocholate, ursodeoxycholate and insulin), acting in a very different way upon bile formation, were not impaired in diabetes. The study of the relationship between bile acid output and bile flow, after infusion of taurocholate at different doses (0.25 to 1.5 mumoles per min per 100 gm body weight) showed that diabetes-induced cholestasis in the rat is mainly related to a decreased bile acid-independent fraction of the bile flow. We tested the possible role of hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia as cholestatic factors in diabetes. Glucose infusion [300 mM, 150 microliter per min (Group G)] induced a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in bile flow (-0.33 microliter per min per gm liver) as compared to the basal period. After acute pancreatectomy (P) or mannoheptulose treatment [0.14 mmole per 100 gm body weight (Group M)], similar cholestatic effects were observed (-0.29 and -0.27 microliter per min per gm liver, respectively). However, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were higher (p less than 0.01) in Group G than in P or M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Osmotic pressure is a basic evolutionary regulatory factor, and hormonal control over albumin production has been demonstrated. Where and why new or old albumin is degraded are questions which have not been clarified, although the vascular endothelium may well be the degradative site. Albumin is important as a transport protein, as a measure of evolution and as a model to study secretion following synthesis without the intervening steps of glycosylation. Investigations as to how this protein enters the endoplasmic membrane may well answer some of the questions concerning signal peptide insertion (288). The role of the urea cycle intermediate ornithine and its participation in polyamine synthesis, which has a positive effect on albumin synthesis, is under study. Likewise, the inverse relation between acute-phase protein synthesis and albumin synthesis regulated by interleukin 1 and other cytokines will merit further study. These are a few of the concepts which will be tested in the future.\r"

The responses of the two subsets and of five normal subjects to sodium intakes of 9, 109, and 249 mEq/day given for 7 days were as follows: The salt-sensitive subjects retained more sodium than normal and plasma or urinary norepinephrine did not decrease when they were given a high sodium intake; urinary dopamine was normal but did not increase normally when sodium intake was increased. The salt-resistant subjects excreted sodium normally and plasma and urinary norepinephrine was decreased by 30 and 37%, respectively, when they were given a high sodium intake; urinary dopamine was supernormal and did not increase further when sodium intake was increased. Cumulative sodium retention during the high sodium intake was directly related to the percentage of change in plasma norepinephrine in the hypertensive subjects, suggesting that renal adrenergic activity was a factor in the impaired sodium excretion in the salt-sensitive patients. Cumulative sodium retention and the percentage of change in plasma norepinephrine were inversely related to urinary dopamine in the hypertensive subjects, suggesting that increased formation of dopamine in renal and neural tissue in the salt-resistant subjects may have been responsible for the differences between the subsets in renal and adrenergic responses to a high sodium intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats with chronic (12 weeks) streptozocin-induced diabetes showed a significant decrease in plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma renin concentration, and plasma aldosterone. However, plasma trypsin activatable inactive renin concentration was increased (11.65 +/- 1.40 vs 6.73 +/- 0.57 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr; p less than 0.001), as were aortic reninlike activity (p less than 0.001) and adrenal renin, both in the zona glomerulosa (p less than 0.01) and the fascicular-reticular-medullary portion (p less than 0.001) with respect to an age-matched control group. After bilateral nephrectomy, plasma renin-angiotensin system components (PRA and plasma active and inactive renin concentrations) as well as aortic and fascicular-reticular-medullary renin activity significantly decreased in both control and diabetic rats. However, glomerular renin activity increased in control nephrectomized rats to the levels observed in diabetic animals but did not change in diabetic nephrectomized rats. The parallel changes of aortic and fascicular-reticular-medullary renin activity and plasma inactive renin concentration in diabetes and nephrectomy suggest an interdependent relationship, whereas the increase of glomerular renin activity in diabetic and nephrectomized animals, both with low levels of PRA, suggests the existence of a local autonomic renin-angiotensin system regulated by plasma feedback. Tissue renin-angiotensin system alterations in diabetes could mean that a pathogenic factor is involved in long-term diabetic complications or that only a compensatory physiological process is at work.\r"

In 3- to 9-month-old SHR, the fall in blood pressure after prazosin pretreatment was significantly smaller than that after chlorisondamine or syrosingopine pretreatment. In ganglion-blocked SHR, prazosin decreased blood pressure only when this parameter had been elevated by an intra-arterial infusion of epinephrine or norepinephrine. In contrast, under the same experimental conditions, yohimbine or rauwolscine administration failed to modify the pressor effects of either phenylephrine or epinephrine but partially reduced those of norepinephrine and, unlike prazosin, strongly antagonized those of B-HT 920. In either intact or ganglion-blocked SHR, a 30-minute intra-arterial infusion of diltiazem at 100.0, but not 25.0, micrograms/kg/min significantly decreased baseline mean tail artery blood pressure. In ganglion-blocked SHR, the smaller dose of diltiazem antagonized by 40 and 80% the pressor effects of norepinephrine and B-HT 920, respectively, but failed to change the vasoconstrictor responses of phenylephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin, which were, however, reduced by the higher dose of diltiazem. These results indicate that, in conscious adult SHR, norepinephrine released by peripheral sympathetic nervous terminals and humorally borne epinephrine stimulate almost exclusively post-junctional alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The latter findings may account for the lack of blood pressure-lowering effects of the studied calcium antagonists at doses that effectively antagonize alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in conscious SHR.\r"

  ".W": "Since suppression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) appears to be a determinant of the diuresis of water immersion (WI) in humans, a further understanding of its responsiveness has important implications for normal physiology, pathophysiology, and space physiology. In recent years, discrepant measurements of AVP in plasma during WI have led to conflicting conclusions. In studies in which the subjects ingested water before or during WI, plasma AVP was reported to be unchanged or even increased. In contrast, plasma AVP was suppressed in studies in which the subjects remained hydropenic. A critical review discloses that water intake before and/or during the experiments introduces several new stimuli for AVP release. Furthermore the lower base-line levels of AVP in hydrated subjects complicate detection of small changes in plasma AVP. Although the mechanisms of AVP suppression during WI are incompletely defined, it appears that not only cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors but also arterial baroreceptors mediate the response. Additional studies are proposed to delineate further the mechanisms governing AVP release during WI.\r"

Analysis of the pressure changes following end-inspiratory interruptions allowed us to partition Rss into two quantities with the units of resistance, one (Rinit) corresponding to the resistance of the airways and the other (Rdif) reflecting the viscoelastic properties of the tissues of the respiratory system as well as gas redistribution following interruption of flow. Rinit and Rdif were used to construct concentration-response curves to MCh. Lung volume was increased by the application of 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure. The curve for Rinit reached a plateau in all cats, demonstrating a limit to the degree of MCh-induced bronchoconstriction. The mean value of Rinit (cmH2O.ml-1.s) for the group under control conditions was 0.011 and rose to 0.058 after maximal bronchoconstriction; the volume at which the flow was interrupted was 11.5 +/- 0.5 (SE) ml/kg above functional residual capacity (FRC). It then fell progressively to 0.029 at 21.2 +/- 0.8 ml/kg above FRC, 0.007 at 35.9 +/- 1.3 ml/kg above FRC, and 0.005 at 52.0 +/- 1.8 ml/kg above FRC.

The slowest nasal clearance was observed for dorsally administered drops. Administration of drops to the ventral surface or sprays to either dorsal or ventral surface results in rapid clearance and little deposition in the turbinates. The octapeptide vasopressin antagonist, SKF 101926, was administered intravenously (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 micrograms/kg) and then on separate occasions intranasally (10, 25, and 50 micrograms/kg as a drop to the ventral surface) to four conscious, trained, female, water-loaded, vasopressin-infused dogs. SKF 101926 reversed the antidiuretic response to vasopressin after administration by either the intravenous or intranasal route in a dose-dependent fashion. Peak dilution of urine occurred within 50- to 60-min postdosing by both routes. Estimated doses to reduce vasopressin antidiuresis by 50% were 1.4 micrograms/kg intravenously and 23 micrograms/kg intranasally. After recovery to at least 70% of antidiuretic base line, and then administration of a second dose of SKF 101926 (3 micrograms/kg), subsequent dilution of urine osmolality was inversely related to the magnitude of the previously administered dose. It is concluded that the estimated relative effectiveness of intranasally administered SKF 101926 is 3-21%, compared with intravenous administration. Acute tachyphylaxis to repeated dosing was observed. The mechanism of the apparent tachyphylaxic response was not elucidated. No tachyphylaxis to less frequent (weekly) dosing was observed.\r"

  ".U": "88186937\r", 
  ".W": "One of the most difficult problems in orthopaedic oncology is reconstruction after resection of a tumor of the proximal end of the femur. In order to achieve a wide margin about a primary or secondary malignant neoplasm of bone, it is often necessary to resect not only the hip joint and fifteen or more centimeters of the proximal part of the femur, but also the surrounding envelope of soft tissue. In some patients, little is left but the sciatic and femoral nerves and vessels. Since 1971, we have done reconstructions in forty-four patients, using an allograft and an implant or else an osteoarticular graft alone to replace the proximal end of the femur. Twenty-eight of these reconstructions were performed in patients who had had a malignant tumor and were followed for two to fifteen years postoperatively. Fifteen of the patients had only an osteoarticular graft, and thirteen had an allograft and a prosthesis (nine Austin Moore, two bipolar, and two long-stem total hip replacements). The average length of the femoral segment was 18.4 centimeters; the longest one measured thirty-one centimeters. Using an evaluation system of functional end-results that includes failures as a result of recurrence of the tumor, we recorded approximately 70 per cent excellent and good results for both groups. When the two failures that were due to recurrence of the tumor were omitted from the statistics (in order to evaluate the allograft procedure more fully), the successful results increased to about 80 per cent. In general, the patients who had an osteoarticular reconstruction fared less well than did those who had an allograft and a prosthesis, but the series were not quite comparable. The major complications were metastases in nine patients (five of whom died), infection in five, and fracture of the allograft in six. Restoration of the reconstruction was possible for most of the patients who had a problem that was not related to the tumor, and only one patient required an amputation for recurrent tumor. Despite the many difficulties, we think that an allograft, with or without a prosthetic implant, should be given primary consideration as a means of reconstruction of the limb when resection of a tumor necessitates resection of a long segment of the proximal end of the femur.\r"

In reviewing the literature, we classified the tumors according to three subgroups: parosteal (juxtacortical) osteosarcoma, periosteal osteosarcoma, and high-grade surface osteosarcoma. We also studied the clinical, radiographic, and histological findings in eighty patients who had been treated for an osteosarcoma over a forty-four-year period. Adequate follow-up data existed for forty-eight of the eighty patients. The duration of follow-up ranged from two to fifteen years after the initial operation (amputation or resection). Patients who had a parosteal osteosarcoma had the best prognosis; those who had a periosteal osteosarcoma, the next best; and those who had a high-grade surface osteosarcoma, the poorest. Because of these widely varying prognoses, the lesions require different treatment.\r"

We studied the degree and time course of systemic vasoconstriction in goats for 24 hours following burns of two sizes (20% and 35% TBSA), in which fluid resuscitation was performed according to a common clinical crystalloid regimen. Cardiac index and urine output (reflecting renal perfusion) fell dramatically at two hours after burn, but returned slowly to preburn levels by 24 hours. The degree of fall and rate of recovery were dependent on burn size. Dermal perfusion was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry in both burned and unburned skin. Dermal perfusion was negligible in burned skin. Unburned skin blood flow fell with increasing burn size, progressively recovered to preburn levels after the small burn, but at 24 hours remained significantly depressed after the larger burn. The stimulus for this persistent skin vasoconstriction is unclear.\r"

Human skin specimens were stored in four physical configurations in RPMI 1640 tissue culture media at 4 degrees C. Skin was transferred to surgically created defects on nude mice after specific storage intervals. Grafts were examined grossly and microscopically after ten days. In the rolled configuration, on storage day 15, the viability of the outside of the roll was significantly better than the inside (P less than 0.01). The graft viability of the outside of the skin rolls was similar for both tissue-to-media ratios as well as for both free-floating configurations (P = 0.27). These findings suggest the optimum cold storage configuration is free floating, and 300 cm2/100 mL is an appropriate skin surface area to volume media ratio. This proportion of tissue to media is in agreement with the minimum ratio currently recommended by the Skin Council of the American Association of Tissue Banks.\r"

Range of motion, motor strength, and sensation of the fascially excised extremities were measured. Twelve comparable patients with extremity burns (mean burn size, 35% TBSA) who had grafts placed on fat were used as positive controls. Patients whose burns were excised to fat had better joint mobility (P = 0.001) and sensory function (P = 0.001) than did patients whose burns were excised to fascia. Both groups had comparable muscle strength.

Through inspection of burn diagrams, 395 patients were identified with burns involving the foot. From 1976 through 1980, 109 patients were managed in a conservative fashion with topical antimicrobial therapy and delayed debridement and grafting; 36 of these patients with severe burns were managed with skeletal suspension. Between 1981 and 1984, 136 patients were treated with earlier surgical debridement and grafting; during this period, skeletal suspension was rarely used. No statistical difference was found in mortality, amputations, incidence of open wounds, development of contractures, or number of patients requiring reconstructive procedures between conservative and early excision therapy except in those children treated with skeletal suspension. Thus in burns involving the feet in children, early excision and grafting does not alter the resultant morbidity compared with conservative burn management.\r"

  ".U": "88187190\r", 
  ".W": "Mitral valve prolapse by current echocardiographic criteria can be diagnosed with surprising frequency in the general population, even when preselected normal subjects are examined. In most of these individuals, however, prolapse is present in the apical four chamber view and absent in roughly perpendicular long-axis views. Previous studies have shown that systolic annular nonplanarity can cause apparent prolapse in the four chamber view without actual leaflet displacement above the most superior points of the anulus, and there is evidence for such nonplanarity in vivo. It is then reasonable to ask whether superior leaflet displacement limited to the four chamber view has any pathologic significance or complications. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to address the following hypothesis: that patients with superior leaflet displacement confined to the four chamber view have no higher frequency of associated echocardiographic abnormalities than do patients without displacement in any view. Such abnormalities, which would provide independent evidence of mitral valve pathology or dysfunction, include leaflet thickening, left atrial enlargement and mitral regurgitation. Leaflet displacement was measured in the parasternal long-axis and apical four chamber views in 312 patients who were studied retrospectively and selected for the absence of forms of heart disease other than mitral valve prolapse. Leaflet thickness and left atrial size were measured and mitral regurgitation was graded. Patients with leaflet displacement limited to the four chamber view were no more likely to have associated abnormalities than were patients without displacement in any view (0 to 2% prevalence, p greater than 0.5). In contrast, patients with leaflet displacement in the long-axis view were significantly more likely to have associated abnormalities (12 to 24%, p less than 0.005), the frequency of which increased with the extent of leaflet displacement in that view (p less than 0.0001). These results suggest that displacement limited to the apical four chamber view is, in general, a normal geometric finding unassociated with echocardiographic evidence of pathologic significance.\r"

To determine whether this finding is consistently present in cardiac tamponade, seven patients were studied prospectively with Doppler echocardiography before and after pericardiocentesis and the results were compared with those found in 20 normal adults and 14 asymptomatic patients with pericardial effusion who did not have definite clinical evidence of tamponade. Doppler ultrasound evaluation included measurement of mitral, tricuspid, aortic, pulmonary and central venous flow velocities, as well as left ventricular ejection and isovolumic relaxation times during inspiration, expiration and apnea. In the patients with severe cardiac tamponade, respiratory variation in transvalvular flow velocities and left ventricular ejection and isovolumic relaxation times were markedly increased compared with values in normal subjects and those obtained after pericardiocentesis. In the 14 asymptomatic patients with pericardial effusion but without overt tamponade, 7 showed respiratory variation in flow velocity similar to that of normal subjects. The other seven patients demonstrated increased respiratory change compared with normal, but less than that in the patients with tamponade. Clinical and hemodynamic data in this latter group suggest that these patients may represent an intermediate stage of pericardial effusion with an element of hemodynamic compromise.\r"

Area ratios of the energy spectra derived from fast Fourier transform analysis were calculated using six separate 140 ms intervals starting at 0, 40, 50 and 60 ms after QRS onset; 40 and 50 ms before QRS end and a variable length interval starting 40 ms before QRS end and extending to the T wave. Total filtered QRS duration, late potential duration and root mean square voltage of the terminal QRS complex were measured from the filtered vector magnitude signal-averaged ECG. The total QRS duration was also measured from the X, Y, Z leads of the unfiltered signal-averaged ECG. Seven variables were significantly different in univariate tests between myocardial infarction patients with and without ventricular tachycardia: three fast Fourier transform area ratios with the sampling interval starting at 1) QRS onset (p = 0.007), 2) 40 ms after QRS onset (p = 0.02), and 3) 60 ms after QRS onset (p less than 0.0001); and all four time domain variables at 1) total filtered QRS duration (p less than 0.0001), 2) late potential duration (p = 0.0001), 3) root mean square terminal QRS voltage (p = 0.0001), and 4) QRS duration from the unprocessed signal-averaged ECG (p less than 0.0001). Of these seven variables, only the fast Fourier transform area ratio starting at QRS onset was significantly different between patients with myocardial infarction without ventricular tachycardia and normal subjects. In multi-variable analysis, the total filtered vector magnitude QRS duration, a time domain variable that includes the late potential, was the only independent factor that separated patients with myocardial infarction with and without associated ventricular tachycardia.\r"

Slides were evaluated for the presence and extent of ventriculocoronary connections, associated developmental abnormalities and secondary changes in the ventricular walls. Whereas extensive blind-ended deep sinusoids were a feature of all five cases with unrelieved obstruction, ventriculocoronary connections were identified in three. Changes that suggested ongoing remodeling provide new evidence for the postnatal temporal evolution of these anomalous communications. The regional distribution of myofiber disarray in hypoplastic right heart supports the concept that vascularization parallels myocardial organization in the developing human heart.\r"

Analysis of current data from the manufacturer, as well as a review of the medical literature, suggests that the overall risk of outlet strut fracture is low and that elective explantation of a well functioning Bjork-Shiley 60 degrees Convexo-Concave valve prosthesis is not warranted. Diagnostic features of outlet strut fracture can be seen with overpenetrated chest X-ray films so that diagnosis can be established promptly.

  ".W": "The effect of ketotifen on bronchial beta-adrenergic tachyphylaxis was studied in healthy volunteers. In a 2-week pilot study, 19 volunteers inhaled 300 micrograms of salbutamol, four times a day. Ten subjects became tachyphylactic to inhaled salbutamol, assessed by a dose-response curve, before and after the 2 weeks of treatment from a metered-dose inhaler. These 10 subjects were then involved in a double-blind, crossover study comparing the effect of ketotifen, 1 mg in the evening during 1 week, and 1 mg, twice daily, during 3 weeks, and placebo on the bronchial beta-adrenergic tachyphylaxis induced by the concomitant administration during the last 2 weeks of each treatment period of 300 micrograms of salbutamol, four times a day, from a metered-dose inhaler. The end of the pilot study preceded the double-blind study by at least 1 month. However, the salbutamol dose-response curve at the beginning of the double-blind study was still significantly decreased, compared to the dose-response curve before the pilot study. During placebo treatment, a further decrease in bronchial beta-adrenergic sensitivity was observed. Treatment with ketotifen prevented the induction of further beta-adrenergic tachyphylaxis. Each 2 weeks of treatment with inhaled salbutamol increased significantly the baseline specific airway conductance; therefore, based on the present data, it is impossible to determine whether ketotifen also restores the sensitivity of an already desensitized beta-adrenergic system in the airways.\r"

Immediate wheal-and-flare skin reactions to allergens and to PAF acether in atopic patients were the same, and when reactions were compared to reactions of nonatopic patients, these reactions to PAF acether and to FMLP were of equivalent intensity. Late-phase reactions were not observed macroscopically with allergen, PAF acether, or FMLP. The cellular responses, assessed by the Rebuck skin window technique, demonstrated a late (24 hours) eosinophilic response to the allergen and to both inflammatory agents, with 33% to 44% of intensively degranulated eosinophils. In comparison, very few, if there were any, eosinophils were observed in the nonatopic patients. Most infiltrated cells were neutrophils. The accumulation of eosinophils in atopic human skin indicates a potent eosinophilotactic activity restricted to the allergic patients. A similar cellular reaction has been observed in lungs from guinea pigs injected with PAF acether or with allergen, and in patients with severe asthma. The chemoattractant activity of FMLP toward eosinophils cannot be accounted for by its histamine-releasing activity and remains to be explained.\r"

Elastin layers were intact in blood vessels and markedly disrupted in bronchioles. By immunofluorescent, major basic protein was demonstrated in eosinophils, was freely deposited outside of eosinophils, especially in the interlobular septum, and was taken up by macrophages. A number of lymphocytes stained positively for IgE. Through an immunoperoxidase stain, septate hyphae of Aspergillus were clearly observed in the lung parenchyma. A significant increase in interleukin-2 positive-staining T cells was observed with an approximate 2:1 ratio of helper to suppressor cells. The use of newer immunohistologic techniques has enabled us to gain additional insights into the pathogenesis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\r"

Patients allergic to grass pollens were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups and followed up to 2 weeks during the peak of the pollen season. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis were evaluated at baseline and after 3, 7, and 14 days of treatment by the physician with patients rating their response daily on diary cards. Both loratadine and mequitazine induced a significant relief of nasal symptoms when these were compared to placebo. Loratadine was found to be significantly superior to placebo after 3 days of treatment, whereas a significant improvement was only observed after 7 days in patients treated with mequitazine. For nonnasal symptoms, none of the two anti-H1 antagonist induced a significant improvement, and this lack of effect may be related to low symptoms at baseline. Loratadine did not induce more side effects than placebo. Loratadine can be considered to be an effective and safe anti H1 histamine with a rapid onset of action.\r"

In 1895, he founded the first journal devoted to gastroenterology. During his long and productive career, Boas was a pioneer in nearly all areas of his field. His most lasting scientific accomplishment is his work on occult bleeding, which first introduced the clinical importance of this abnormal finding for the early diagnosis of gastric carcinoma. Fifty years ago, in 1938, Ismar Boas killed himself as the Nazis occupied Vienna. In this article, we honor the memory of a great physician and retrace the circumstances of his death.\r"

  ".W": "T cell autoreactivity to insulin in type I diabetic and related non-diabetic individuals was analyzed. Peripheral T lymphocytes from both insulin-treated diabetic and untreated non-diabetic members of four families were found to proliferate in vitro in response to human insulin. T cell autoreactivity to insulin therefore does not appear to be diagnostic of the onset of type I diabetes. Highest T cell responses to human insulin were usually detected in insulin-dependent type I diabetes patients treated with a mixture of beef and pork insulin than with self insulin, the greater the dose of animal insulin the higher the T cell response. The T cell repertoires for self insulin appear to be similar in diabetics and non-diabetics based on their patterns of T cell reactivity to beef insulin, port insulin, human insulin, and various peptide of human insulin. The autoreactive T cells analyzed recognize two conformational epitopes of human insulin formed by interactions between A chain and B chain residues. One epitope is associated with the A chain loop and is present in the A1-A14/B1-B16 peptide, and the other epitope consists mainly of B chain residues located in the A16-A21/B10-B25 peptide. These two epitopes are present in amphipathic alpha-helical regions of insulin. HLA-DR (DR3, DR4, and DR5) and HLA-DQ (DQw2/DQw3) Ag can restrict these T cell responses to human insulin epitopes. The ability to detect insulin-specific autoreactive T cells in healthy non-diabetic individuals supports the hypothesis that autoreactive lymphocytes do not necessarily elicit autoimmune disease if present in an environment in which their activity is immunoregulated.\r"

  ".W": "The 25,000-Da protein that is seen in immunoprecipitates with antibodies to class II MHC molecules or to Ii was shown to be a C-terminal fragment of Ii. [35S]Methionine pulse-chase labeling of polyclonally activated B lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated maximal appearance of p25 in Percoll-separated endosomal fractions at 20- to 40-min chase times (studies in progress). This finding was consistent with the view that proteolysis of Ii to p25 and its release might catalyze the binding of digested foreign peptides to class II molecules and/or govern release of such charged complexes to traffic to the cell surface. We examined the structural relationship of p25 to Ii and the basis for cleavage of a relatively restricted site just external to the transmembranal segment. [35S]Methionine-labeled Ii and associated molecules were immunoprecipitated with a mAb to native Ii and then denatured, resolubilized, and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with various antibodies. Two antisera to C-terminal peptides of Ii (183 to 193 and 192 to 211), but not antibodies to an N-terminal peptide (12 to 28), did immunoprecipitate p25. The three antibodies to C-terminal and N-terminal peptides all immunoprecipitated denatured Ii proteins. The mAb to Ii immunoprecipitated [35S]methionine-labeled p25 but not [35S]cysteine-labeled p25. This finding was consistent with loss of a portion of Ii containing the only cysteine in Ii, Cys28. Digestion of class II MHC Ag-Ii complexes with various proteases yielded proteins migrating at and near p25 in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels. Upon increasing the duration of protease digestion, the 25,000-Da fragments were relatively resistant to further digestion. This observation was consistent with the presence of secondary structures (domains) leaving a relatively protease-sensitive (Ig hinge-like) region in Ii near its insertion into the membrane.\r"

We have previously shown that some of these antibodies are highly protective in the treatment of experimental infections in neonatal rats, whereas others do not appear to have any protective efficacy. Using an ELISA, we demonstrate the specificity of both protective and nonprotective antibodies. Two antibodies, binding different epitopes, are directed against antigenic structures present on all GBS; two are specific for type III carbohydrate determinants; one binds to a protein Ag present on all type I and II GBS; and one appears to bind to type Ia GBS only. Quantitative absorption assays provide evidence that the difference between protective antibodies and nonprotective antibodies is the avidity that the antibody demonstrates for the epitope recognized on the surface of the bacteria; 10 to 15 times as much protective antibody binds to GBS as does nonprotective antibody. Direct binding experiments with radiolabeled antibody confirm this conclusion.\r"

  ".U": "88187401\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies show that cytotoxic activated macrophages cause a reproducible pattern of metabolic inhibition in viable tumor target cells. This includes inhibition of DNA synthesis, two oxidoreductases of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase and succinate: ubiquinone oxidoreductase), and the citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase. This pattern of metabolic inhibition is induced by a cytotoxic activated macrophage associated biochemical pathway with L-arginine deimination activity that synthesizes L-citrulline from L-arginine and oxygenated nitrogen derivatives from the imino nitrogen removed from the guanido group of L-arginine. Here we report that macrophages activated in vivo by infection with bacillus Calmette-Guerin or in vitro by murine rIFN-gamma or murine IFN-alpha/beta (in the presence of the second signal LPS in all cases) develop inhibition of aconitase and the same two oxidoreductases of the mitochondrial electron transport chain as was documented earlier in target cells of cytotoxic activated macrophages. In addition, this pattern of metabolic inhibition which develops in cytotoxic activated macrophages is caused by the L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by effectors of the L-arginine-dependent cytotoxicity system results in a compensatory increase in activity of the glycolytic pathway. We speculate that the pattern of metabolic inhibition induced in cytotoxic activated macrophages by the L-arginine-dependent effector system causes changes in the macrophage intracellular environment that increases resistance to certain facultative and obligate intracellular pathogens.\r"

High-dose ara-C (HDara-C) and TBI with or without CY can be administered with approximately the same toxicity as CY plus TBI. Phase III studies appear warranted to determine if these newer regimens provide improved results compared with currently used regimens.\r"

  ".W": "From 1969 through 1982, 184 patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease (HD) were treated with combined modality therapy (CMT) at Yale University. The data were reanalyzed in November 1986, with a mean follow-up of 10 years. The patient population consisted of 102 newly diagnosed stages IIIB and IV patients, and 82 patients who had relapsed after initial radical radiotherapy. From 1969 through 1978, the treatment program was induction chemotherapy with nitrogen mustard, vincristine, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MVVPP) for three cycles (6 months) followed by low-dose radiation (1,500 to 2,500 cGy) for patients who had achieved complete remission (CR), to all disease sites present before the onset of chemotherapy. From 1978 to 1982, selected \"poor-risk\" advanced-stage patients received nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone plus Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (MOPP-ABVD) induction chemotherapy, while the remaining patients were randomized between MVVPP and MOPP. One hundred fifty-one patients have achieved CR (82%); 23 (15%) of these 151 have relapsed, with the remaining 128 patients in continuous CR. A total of 62 patients have died, 45 due to HD, and 17 due to other causes. Twelve of these 17 patients died of second malignancies. The 15-year actuarial survival of all patients is 54%. It is 71% if deaths due only to HD are considered. Within the overall group of advanced HD patients, age and multiple extranodal sites of involvement continue to constitute adverse risk factors. The three drug programs used were all equivalent. No improvement resulted from the use of MOPP-ABVD in the poor-risk patients. These results compare favorably with those recently published by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). CMT resulted in an approximate 20% improvement in survival with no increase in second malignancies when compared with chemotherapy alone.\r"

The same chemotherapy was used in both arms: 6 mg/m2, vinblastine, hour 0; 30 mg, bleomycin, hour 6; 200 mg, methotrexate, hours 24 to 26; 45 mg, leucovorin, hour 48. One hundred sixteen patients entered the study, 55 in arm A and 61 in arm B. The patients all had previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Forty-five patients had stage III and 71 had stage IV disease. The two arms were fully comparable. As of April 1986, 116 patients were evaluable for survival, while 112 were evaluable for toxicity and 105 for response. Response analysis shows that there were 14 complete responses (CR) and 11 partial responses (PR), for an overall response rate (ORR) of 52% in arm A, and 30 CRs and seven PRs, for an ORR of 64.9% in arm B. The difference in terms of CR between the two arms was statistically significant (P less than .03). Progression-free survival (PFS) was also statistically different, with an advantage for arm B (P less than .05), but without differences in overall survival. Arm B correlates with a significant increase in mucositis compared with arm A (P less than .001).\r"

To study this question, the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing best supportive care (BSC) to two chemotherapy regimens, vindesine and cisplatin (VP), and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CAP). Between February 1983 and January 1986, 23 centers across Canada entered 251 patients on study. Eighteen centers participated in the three-arm schema (150 patients); centers choosing not to participate in a study with a no-chemotherapy arm followed a two-arm schema comparing VP with CAP (101 additional patients). Altogether, 233 patients were eligible. Patients had measurable or evaluable disease, with either distant metastases (82.5%) or bulky limited disease considered inoperable or unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. The treatment groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, performance status, histology, disease extent, and weight loss. The overall response rates (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) on the chemotherapy arms were CAP, 15.3%, and VP, 25.3% (P = .06). Patients on the three-arm portion of the trial had a median survival of 32.6 weeks when treated with VP, 24.7 weeks with CAP, and 17 weeks with BSC. The significance of the differences in survival, adjusted for prognostic factors, is as follows: chemotherapy v BSC, P = .02; VP v BSC, P = .01; and CAP v BSC, P = .05. Toxicity on the chemotherapy arms was significant, with leukopenia of severe or greater degree occurring in 37.8% (CAP) and 40.0% (VP), severe vomiting in 12.2% (CAP) and 23.3% (VP), and severe neurotoxicity in 15.6% (VP).\r"

The total duration of treatment was six cycles (18 weeks). In 132 fully evaluable patients the objective response rates were 19% for 5-FU and 22% for 5-FU plus cisplatin.

To assess the safety and efficacy of BW942C in controlling diarrhea caused by cisplatin, 30 adults with lung cancer who had already experienced diarrhea (three or more loose bowel movements) during the 24-hour period following a prior cisplatin administration were randomized to receive either BW942C or placebo during the next cisplatin course. All patients received a concomitant antiemetic regimen including metoclopramide, dexamethasone, and lorazepam during all courses. Patients administered BW942C experienced less diarrhea (27% v 67%, P = .02). Twenty-seven percent of patients given the pentapeptide had loose bowel movements as opposed to 93% who received placebo (P = .0002). There were no significant differences in the incidence and degree of vomiting and other treatment-related side effects observed between the placebo and treatment groups. We conclude that oral BW942C is more effective than placebo in controlling diarrhea following cisplatin chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Chemical modification is a concept in cancer therapy in which the state of tumor cells or normal tissues is modified such that a therapeutic gain can be achieved using conventional therapeutic modalities. Hypoxic zones targeted as cells within them may be radiation resistant, poorly perfused by chemotherapeutic agents, and possibly drug resistant due to hypoxia-related gene amplification. Nitroimidazoles have gained particular attention as chemical modifiers because they can increase the radiation sensitivity of hypoxic cells, are cytotoxic to hypoxic cells, can increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, and are useful for imaging hypoxic cells. While both radiosensitization and chemosensitization require hypoxia, the mechanism of the enhancement of each of the modalities is different. The 2-nitroimidazole hypoxic sensitizers SR 2508 and Ro-03-8799, which are less toxic than the prototype misonidazole (Miso), are in clinical trials, and dual function molecules that include a hypoxic sensitizer and alkylating function are being developed. The presence of both acutely and chronically hypoxic cells in animal tumors has been demonstrated by new imaging techniques. Oxygen delivery to tumors is being altered by the use of perfluorocarbons, and agents that alter hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. Compounds that are selectively toxic to hypoxic cells are being developed. Nonhypoxic modifiers are also being investigated. Thiol modification, particularly the alteration of glutathione concentration, has complex effects on the cell's biochemistry, in addition to affecting the competition between oxygen and thiol groups for the restoration and fixation of radiation-induced radicals. WR-2721 is being studied as a means of reducing the normal tissue toxicity of radiation and chemotherapy. Increased thiol concentration may be a mechanism of cross-resistance between certain chemotherapeutic agents and radiation.\r"

  ".W": "Significant advances in the management of disseminated carcinoma of the testis have had a tremendous influence on the management of all stages of disease, including both stage I and stage II. Because the disease is so uniformly curable in advanced forms, strategies have evolved for lower stages of disease to maximize curative potential with minimization of therapeutic intervention and potential long-term side effects. This review addresses issues of diagnosis and initial clinical staging of patients with stage I carcinoma of the testis. The usefulness of biological tumor markers and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of radiographic imaging modalities are emphasized. The traditional treatment of stage I seminomas and nonseminomas includes the role of both radiation therapy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Treatment results and complications of each modality are also reviewed. The importance of orchiectomy followed by meticulous surveillance, as well as a critical analysis of prognostic features of subsequent locoregional or systemic relapse in patients with stage I testis cancer, focuses attention on changing concepts of this disease. The rationale underlying improved ability to stage patients meticulously and offer therapeutic intervention when necessary following orchiectomy, constitutes the focus of present and future clinical research. Such strategies are discussed in detail.\r"

The results are reported of a retrospective review of the presentation, treatment, and outcome of 36 children under the age of 18 years treated between 1974 and 1986. Eleven children had germinomas (two-cell type), seven had astrocytomas, and the remaining 18 had 15 histologically different tumor types. Surgery was performed on 30 patients; there were no deaths, but a 10% rate of persistent morbidity was found. The median follow-up period was 4 years. Nine (82%) of 11 patients with germinomas are alive without evidence of recurrence; one child died from recurrent tumor in the pineal region and another is presently being treated for recurrent tumor of the spinal cord. Six (86%) of the seven patients with astrocytoma are well after biopsy and radiation therapy. Of the remaining 18 children, five (28%) died from tumor progression. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin were helpful in determining the presence of malignant germ-cell tumors, particularly those with a poor prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging was useful for diagnosis and for planning the operative approach. Magnetic resonance images showed the presence of pineal region tumors in four children with hydrocephalus who had no evidence of tumor on computerized tomography scans. Because the great variety of tumor types found in the pineal region must be treated in different ways and because improved microsurgical and stereotaxic surgical techniques have made mortality and morbidity rates acceptably low, a biopsy diagnosis should be obtained in all patients. Preoperative assessment of CSF tumor markers and cytology is useful for the identification of patients who have a poor prognosis.\r"

After an overnight fast, 11 healthy volunteers received an intraduodenal infusion of saline for 60 min. This was followed by infusion of either of three test meals: extract of raw soybeans (RS), a low inhibitor soy protein isolate (SPI) or bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 g/h for 60 min. Then saline was again given intraduodenally for 30 min. Gastric juice was collected continuously and duodenal juice and peripheral blood samples were collected every 10 min. Duodenal chymotryptic activity was severely inhibited by RS, whereas SPI and BSA increased the chymotryptic activity. Tryptic activity showed a transient reduction (55%) during RS infusion, whereas BSA and in particular SPI increased the tryptic activity. No change was seen in amylase activity. The lack of total inhibition of tryptic activity has been studied further and is the subject of the accompanying paper. The peripheral plasma levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) increased significantly during BSA but not during SPI or RS infusions. Thus, CCK levels were not increased by the inhibition of the proteolytic activity by RS in duodenal juice.\r"

The results suggested the presence of an inhibitor-resistant trypsin. Practically no inhibition was obtained with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, human alpha 1-antitrypsin or lima bean trypsin inhibitor. Specificity against synthetic substrates was different from that obtained in the absence of raw soybeans. Duodenal aspirates containing this new trypsin activity were able to further inhibit tryptic and chymotryptic activity of basal aspirates from the duodenum, demonstrating surplus amounts of inhibitors in the duodenal juice. Further incubation of trypsin-inhibitor complexes at 37 degrees C, in the presence of surplus uninhibited (trypsin and chymotrypsin) duodenal juice, restored tryptic activity. This activity was not inhibitor-resistant. The results obtained for trypsin activity based on esterase assays were confirmed by a proteolytic assay. It is concluded that the increase in tryptic activity in human duodenal juice during raw soybean infusion is due to a previously unidentified inhibitor-resistant trypsin and not due to inactivation of the inhibitors in raw soybeans.\r"

  ".W": "The physician must have a high index of suspicion to detect SCC early in patients with malignancy. Back pain is the first symptom in almost all patients, and the diagnosis should be considered for all older patients with back pain. Asking about back pain should be a routine part of the review of systems, especially for patients with known malignancies. Clinically, it is impossible to tell whether or not a patient who has back pain and cancer has epidural SCC. Patients may be stratified as to the likelihood of SCC using the history and physical examination, but the diagnosis relies on radiographic visualization of the spinal cord. It may be acceptable to closely follow patients with normal neurologic examinations and normal plain films, but even this is controversial and includes only a minority of patients. Myelography remains the test of choice. MRI will play an increasingly important role in the future, but has not yet been systematically evaluated. The best therapeutic approach is not clear, but standard treatment is only about 50% effective in all cases. At present, radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for many patients, in particular those who are ambulatory at diagnosis. Anterior resection with vertebral body reconstruction is an exciting approach and may substantially improve the prognosis for patients who are paraparetic or paraplegic. It is important to attempt to choose for each patient the diagnostic and therapeutic options offering the best chance for comfort and preservation of function. The decision of how or even whether to treat is multifactorial and is more complicated than the determination of simply whether or not compression is present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tumors are likely to be highly heterogeneous for these dynamic properties. Hypoxic cells are radioresistant, requiring two to three times the radiation dose to kill them compared to the same cells in a eu-oxic state. Hypoxia can be of two types: 1) chronic hypoxia, which is diffusion limited, and 2) acute hypoxia, which is perfusion limited. The mechanism of and approaches toward these are different and can serve as a model for other biochemical and physiologic processes that may affect treatment outcome.\r"

In both programs, estimates of the mean duration of early-stage adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma of lung ranged upward from 4 years, and estimates of the probability of detecting it in early-stage disease ranged downward from .16. The probabilities of curing early-stage disease through surgical treatment were found to be at most .52 and .13 in the New York and Baltimore studies, respectively. These estimates led to the conclusion that expected reduction in mortality from adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma of lung as due to annual x-ray screening from age 45 to 80 years is not greater than 18% in New York and 5% in Baltimore.\r"

  ".W": "Several previous studies have demonstrated that both partially purified and recombinant alpha-interferons (alpha-IFNs) have high response rates in advanced hairy cell leukemia. However, the optimal dose and duration of therapy have not yet been defined. In this study, 90 patients were randomized after 12 months of IFN alfa-2b therapy with a standard dose of 2 X 10(6) U/m2 sc three times weekly to either no further therapy or an additional 6 months of therapy (18 mo total). There was no significant difference in the peripheral blood cell counts between the two groups (when analyzed) dating from the end of IFN therapy rather than from the time of randomization. Eighteen evaluable patients relapsed and were re-treated with IFN: 11 in the no-further-therapy group and 7 in the treated group. No patient was resistant to re-treatment with IFN. There was a significantly greater incidence of fatigue in the treated group (44% vs. 21%; P = .02) during the first 6 postrandomization months. We conclude that the duration of IFN therapy does not influence the clinical course after therapy is discontinued, but responses are maintained while patients receive therapy. However, because of a high incidence of fatigue with prolonged therapy and the ability to reinduce a second response, we recommend that IFN therapy be discontinued after 12 months in asymptomatic patients.\r"

All of the patients experienced skin fragility in the autograft sites, and three of the four patients reported spontaneous blisters. Epidermal-dermal adherence was objectively examined in one patient by comparing suction blistering times in the autograft and in a parallel, control, unburned site. Blisters formed in the autograft at 17 minutes, and the cleavage plane of the blister was below the lamina densa of the basement membrane. In contrast, the normal skin blistered at 65 minutes and had a superficial cleavage plane, above the basal lamina. In all four patients, the reconstituted basement membrane zone beneath the autografts was incomplete and lacked type IV (basement membrane) collagen 7-S sites and anchoring fibrils. We conclude that skin fragility, apparent as late as seven months after transplantation, may result from defective anchoring fibrils.\r"

Nonetheless, many aspects of their use remain controversial, partly because of concerns about test accuracy. This article reviews the scientific basis for the evaluation, performance, and use of the most commonly employed HIV assays. Current test performance could be improved by better standardization of test procedures and institution of mandatory proficiency testing and licensure of clinical laboratories that perform HIV testing. Test utility could be enhanced by sequencing tests more appropriately and by interpreting test results in conjunction with the clinical purpose for which the test is being used and the characteristics of the population under study. Finally, HIV tests should be evaluated in a manner that minimizes spectrum and referral bias and inadequate reference standard confirmation, problems that have affected the evaluation of current tests.\r"

Regular walking may help improve cholesterol profile, help control hypertension, and slow the process of osteoporosis. Recent physiological studies have demonstrated that brisk walking provides strenuous enough exercise for cardiovascular training in most adults. A recently developed submaximal 1-mile walk test provides a simple and accurate means for estimating aerobic capacity and guiding exercise prescription. These new insights and tools will assist the clinician in the prescription of safe and effective walking programs.\r"

By the end of 60 days on 200 mg once a day (the lowest daily dose) 56% of patients had recurrences. Patients showed a marked reduction in the frequency of recurrence during therapy (from a mean of 1.1 per 28 days before to 0.11 during treatment, p = 0.0001). After stopping treatment the frequency of recurrences (0.71 per 28 days) was significantly less than the pre-treatment period (p = 0.001). No important side-effects were seen.

The most common method of DNA analysis, that of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), requires microgram amounts of relatively undegraded DNA for multi-locus typing, and hundreds of nanograms for single-locus comparisons. Such DNA frequently cannot be obtained from forensic samples such as single hairs and blood stains, or from anthropological, genetic or zoological samples collected in the field. To detect polymorphic DNA sequences from single human hairs, we have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which specific short regions of a gene can be greatly amplified in vitro from as little as a single molecule of DNA. We have detected genetically variable mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences from the root region of shed, as well as freshly-plucked, single hairs; mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences have been detected in a sample from a single hair shaft. We have used three different means of DNA typing on these samples: the determination of amplified DNA fragment length differences, hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes, and direct DNA sequencing.\r"

  ".W": "About 30% of human tumours contain a mutation in one of the three ras genes leading to the production of p21ras oncoproteins that are thought to make a major contribution to the transformed phenotype of the tumour. The biochemical mode of action of the ras proteins is unknown but as they bind GTP and GDP and have an intrinsic GTPase activity, they may function like regulatory G proteins and control cell proliferation by regulating signal transduction pathways at the plasma membrane. It is assumed that an external signal is detected by a membrane molecule (or detector) that stimulates the conversion of p21.GDP to p21.GTP which then interacts with a target molecule (or effector) to generate an internal signal. Recently a cytoplasmic protein, GAP, has been identified that interacts with the ras proteins, dramatically increasing the GTPase activity of normal p21 but not of the oncoproteins. We report here that GAP appears to interact with p21ras at a site previously identified as the 'effector' site, strongly implicating GAP as the biological target for regulation by p21.\r"

  ".W": "Serine proteases are present in virtually all organisms and function both inside and outside the cell; they exist as two families, the 'trypsin-like' and the 'subtilisin-like', that have independently evolved a similar catalytic device characterized by the Ser, His, Asp triad, an oxyanion binding site, and possibly other determinants that stabilize the transition state (Fig. 1). For Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin, these functional elements impart a total rate enhancement of at least 10(9) to 10(10) times the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of amide bonds. We have examined the catalytic importance and interplay between residues within the catalytic triad by individual or multiple replacement with alanine(s), using site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned B. amyloliquefaciens subtilisin gene. Alanine substitutions were chosen to minimize unfavourable steric contacts and to avoid imposing new charge interactions or hydrogen bonds from the substituted side chains. In contrast to the effect of mutations in residues involved in substrate binding, the mutations in the catalytic triad greatly reduce the turnover number and cause only minor effects on the Michaelis constant. Kinetic analyses of the multiple mutants demonstrate that the residues within the triad interact synergistically to accelerate amide bond hydrolysis by a factor of approximately 2 X 10(6).\r"

  ".W": "The generation of second messengers from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) by phosphoinositidase C has been implicated in the mediation of cellular responses to a variety of growth factors and oncogene products. The first step in the production of PtdInsP2 from phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) is catalysed by PtdIns kinase. A PtdIns kinase activity has been found to associate specifically with several oncogene products, as well as with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor. We have previously identified two biochemically distinct PtdIns kinases in fibroblasts, and have found that only one of these, designated type I, specifically associates with activated tyrosine kinases. We have now characterized the site on the inositol ring phosphorylated by type I PtdIns kinase, and find that this kinase specifically phosphorylates the D-3 ring position to generate a novel phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). In contrast, the main PtdIns kinase in fibroblasts, designated type II, specifically phosphorylates the D-4 position to produce phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), previously considered to be the only form of PtdInsP. We have also tentatively identified PtdIns(3)P as a minor component of total PtdInsP in intact fibroblasts. We propose that type I PtdIns kinase is responsible for the generation of PtdIns(3)P in intact cells, and that this novel phosphoinositide could be important in the transduction of mitogenic and oncogenic signals.\r"

Human peripheral blood neutrophils have IgA receptors, but these cells do not normally participate in IgA-mediated phagocytosis. The haematopoietic factors granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prime neutrophils to be more responsive to a variety of stimuli. We therefore studied their effect on IgA-mediated phagocytosis. GM-CSF and G-CSF both induce a change from low to high-affinity neutrophil IgA Fc crystallizable fragment receptors within 30 min; a change which is associated with the development of IgA-mediated phagocytosis. Human IL-3, which does not affect neutrophil function, is inactive in this system. These results define a new mechanism for CSF-augmented host defence whereby neutrophil function can be modulated by CSF-mediated IgA Fc receptor activation.\r"

  ".W": "Diffuse X-ray scattering from protein crystals provides information about molecular flexibility and packing irregularities. Here we analyse diffraction patterns from insulin crystals that show two types of scattering related to disorder: very diffuse, liquid-like diffraction, and haloes around the Bragg reflections. The haloes are due to coupled displacements of neighbouring molecules in the lattice, and the very diffuse scattering results from variations in atomic positions that are only locally correlated within each molecule. The measured intensity was digitally separated into three components: the Bragg reflections and associated haloes; the water and Compton scattering; and the scattering attributed to internal protein movements. We extend methods used to analyse disorder in membrane structures to simulate the diffuse scattering from crystalline insulin in terms of (1) the Patterson (autocorrelation) function of the ideal, ordered crystal structure, (2) the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) amplitude of the atomic movements, and (3) the mean distance over which these displacements are coupled. Movements of the atoms within the molecules, with r.m.s. amplitudes of 0.4-0.45 A, appear to be coupled over a range of approximately 6 A, as in a liquid. These locally coupled movements account for most of the disorder in the crystal. Also, the protein molecules, as a whole, jiggle in the lattice with r.m.s. amplitudes of approximately 0.25 A that appear to be significantly correlated only between nearest neighbours.\r"

This striking correlation between vascularization and the presence of astrocytes led Stone and Dreher to postulate that retinal astrocytes are immigrants that enter the retina with its vasculature, although others have suggested that they derive from Muller cells. Here we provide strong evidence that astrocytes in the diffusely vascularized rat retina are immigrants from the optic nerve.\r"

Forty-three (25%) of the patients delivered an infant with a birth weight below the tenth percentile for gestational age. The last Doppler study before delivery was abnormal in 48.8% of the growth-retarded infants but in only 13.2% of the infants without evidence of IUGR. Furthermore, in the growth-retarded group, early delivery, reduced birth weight, decreased amniotic fluid at birth, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal complications associated with IUGR, and a prolonged hospital stay were observed more frequently in those who had an abnormal ratio than in those with a normal ratio. The sensitivity of the systolic/diastolic ratio for an adverse perinatal outcome (operative delivery for fetal distress, neonatal morbidity associated with IUGR, and/or perinatal death) was significantly better for the infants with IUGR (66.7%) than for the infants without IUGR (27.8%; P less than .05). The predictive value of an abnormal ratio was also higher for the pregnancies complicated with IUGR (57.1%) than for those without IUGR (29.4%), but not to a statistically significant degree. These data suggest that Doppler umbilical velocimetry studies are valuable in identifying those growth-retarded fetuses at increased risk for an adverse perinatal outcome.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we attempted to develop a surveillance protocol for elective first-trimester termination to see whether unsuspected ectopic pregnancy could be detected earlier, and to identify those patients with unsuspected second-trimester pregnancies that could be terminated more safely in the hospital. Two hundred fifty consecutive patients requesting elective termination were studied prospectively. All were 12 weeks or less by last menstrual period, had positive urinary pregnancy tests, and had no history of vaginal bleeding. All patients had ultrasound screening before curettage. Immediately after curettage, a \"modified\" gross pathologic examination (3X magnification) was also performed on unstained curettage material. The sonographic, operative, and pathologic findings were all correlated. Such screening identified four patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancies, who were operated on the same day as the curettage. In addition, four patients, who were actually in the second trimester but had inaccurate dates, were identified and referred to hospital for appropriate methods of termination. We conclude that such surveillance may reduce morbidity in elective terminations and more rapidly identify unsuspected ectopic pregnancies.\r"

The natural history is not completely known and the results of nonoperative treatment questioned. The costs are high due to over-referral and numerous physician visits and radiographs. Would it not be best to wait until the epidemiologic questions are answered? The best approach is one in the middle ground. The program needs to be organized and strengthened. With the education of screeners, over-referral can be reduced. The treating physician must confirm the physical finding, take appropriate radiographs, and plan appropriate follow-up. In this way, the costs will be reduced. In addition, with knowledge regarding natural history, only larger curves or progressive curves will be treated. Nonoperative treatment of idiopathic scoliosis is effective. It can control progression and even result in correction of some curves. The overall effectiveness of braces and electrical stimulation needs to be constantly reviewed. How do these forms of nonoperative treatment affect the progressive curve, and do they reduce the need for surgery in idiopathic scoliosis? Only after we have more studies on natural history and on the results of nonoperative treatment can screening for scoliosis be reassessed to determine its role in the overall treatment program of spinal deformities.\r"

  ".U": "88189613\r", 
  ".W": "The Harrington instrumentation system was the first widely used, internationally accepted internal fixation system for the correction of idiopathic scoliosis when combined with a spinal arthrodesis. It has been generally available to the orthopedic surgeon for more than 25 years, and therefore its capabilities and limitations have been identified through this long experience. Its implantation requires minimal invasion of the spinal canal and is associated with a low (less than 0.5 per cent) incidence of neurologic complications. It provides predictable correction of spinal deformity with little subsequent loss of correction. When compared with other newer, more complex internal fixation systems for spinal deformities, the Harrington system has a shorter, less difficult \"learning curve\"; requires less operating time and blood loss to insert; implants a smaller mass of metal; and in some cases costs substantially less for the implant system. The Harrington system has an extremely low incidence of hook dislodgment and pseudoarthrosis formation in single thoracic curves, being reported as near zero for these curves in two recently published series. Conversely, there are some disadvantages to the Harrington system when compared with other types of fixation. It has limited ability to provide sagittal plane control. It does not effectively and predictably derotate the spine. A recent study showed that at an average of 4 years postoperatively, nearly two thirds of the patients had an actual increase in their rib prominence. The pseudoarthrosis rate is high, up to 4 per cent, in the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine. Hook dislodgment approaches 3 per cent when used below the thoracic region. Another disadvantage is the necessity for postoperative external support. As a result, the Harrington system remains an excellent means of treating single and double thoracic idiopathic curves in a safe and predictable manner, while admittedly having limited derotation and sagittal plane control. Other systems that are more sophisticated at segmental fixation of the spine appear to be more appropriate for scoliotic deformities requiring fusion of the thoracolumbar or lumbar spine and those associated with significant sagittal plane deformities.\r"

The patient should be evaluated thoroughly by physical examination and by adequate radiographs, including bending films. The surgeon should be familiar with different types of techniques and their qualities. The goals of surgery should be outlined clearly and understood between the physician and the patient. The patient should be provided with sufficient and easy-to-understand information (Table 1), and be encouraged to have an input in the decision-making process. For instance, is the goal of surgery to stop progression? To achieve cosmetic correction? To preserve maximal spinal mobility or to help improve pulmonary function? Is it important for the patient to be cast free postoperatively? Once the goal is defined, and we are aware of the abilities of each technique, then we can arrive at a realistic expectation. Again, it is of utmost importance that the surgeon select the procedure that he or she has adequate experience in performing.\r"

A careful analysis of the pain, including a careful history and the use of discography and facet blocks, has greatly enhanced the success rate both in terms of correction and relief of symptoms postoperatively. Zielke instrumentation is the preferred surgical technique for thoracolumbar curves that do not require extension of the fusion to the sacrum. Cotrel-Dubousset fixation is particularly advocated in those cases that show evidence of spinal stenosis and require posterior decompression or in cases of rigid kyphoscoliosis following an anterior release. Fusions of the sacrum require a combined anterior and posterior approach. Iatrogenic loss of lumbar lordosis can be prevented by careful attention to detail and posterior instrumentation with preservation of lumbar lordosis, contouring of rods, and hyperextension of spine and hips at the time of surgery. Loss of lumbar lordosis, which may result in marked fatigue and pain as well as a deformity often worse than the initial one, can be corrected, preferably by a combined anterior and posterior approach (Fig. 5).\r"

  ".W": "Symptomatic loss of lumbar lordosis is a disabling complication of scoliosis surgery. This so-called \"flat-back syndrome\" is characterized by an inability to stand erect and by upper back pain. Distraction instrumentation extending into the lower lumbar spine or sacrum is the most frequently identified etiologic factor responsible for loss of lordosis. The more distal the level of instrumentation, the severer the loss of lumbar lordosis. Other factors that may aggravate the loss of lordosis include thoracolumbar kyphosis, fixed thoracic kyphosis, hip flexion contractures, and pseudoarthrosis. Because of the wide range of values for kyphosis and lordosis in normal individuals, there is no absolute value that can be considered \"normal.\" It is the overall sagittal plane balance that is most important. The most useful radiographic measurement to evaluate this sagittal plane balance is the full-length standing lateral radiograph with the knees extended. On this view, the C7-S1 measurement should fall within 2 cm of the anterior aspect of the sacrum. Surgical treatment for symptomatic loss of lumbar lordosis consists of closing wedge osteotomies through the fusion mass. This should generally be preceded by an anterior release and interbody fusion. Correction should be obtained at the site of the deformity with particular attention paid to the thoracolumbar junction. The surgery is difficult and the risk of complication is high. The most important aspect of this postural disorder is prevention. Avoid distraction instrumentation that extends into the lumbar spine if possible. When distraction instrumentation is used, the techniques described will help preserve lumbar lordosis. When performing a fusion to the sacrum, distraction instrumentation should not be used.\r"

Because of the occurrence of ceftazidime-resistant Gram-positive primary infections, vancomycin was added to CAZ after the first year of study. Of 206 evaluable episodes 76 (37%) were documented infections including 20 bacteremias; 130 (63%) episodes were caused by fever of unknown origin. The number of complete responses to initial therapy in patients with documented infections did not differ among regimens: 26 of 43 (61%) for KCG, 9 of 16 (56%) for ceftazidime and 8 of 16 (50%) for CAZ + vancomycin (not significant). In patients with fever of unknown origin, response without modification of the initial regimen was 52 of 62 (84%) in the KCG arm, 32 of 40 (80%) on CAZ and 23 of 29 (80%) in patients treated with CAZ + vancomycin (not significant). Modifications of the regimen were similar among all three groups and were due primarily to the use of empiric antifungal or antiviral therapy and to empiric treatment of interstitial pneumonia. Hypokalemia occurred in 25 of 105 patients treated with KCG and in 4 of 101 treated with CAZ or CAZ + vancomycin (P less than 0.001). No differences between the efficacy of KCG, CAZ and CAZ + vancomycin as initial empiric therapy were demonstrated.\r"

On study Day 0, all subjects were challenged intranasally with rhinovirus type 39 (dose = 100 TCID50). Subjects were cloistered from Day 2 to Day 7, at which time they were treated with either chlorpheniramine or placebo. From 3 days before challenge to study Day 19, subjects had nasal patency assessed by rhinomanometry, eustachian tube function assessed by the 9-step test and sonotubometry, middle ear pressure assessed by tympanometry and nasal clearance assessed by the dyed-saccharin technique. Symptom diaries were maintained throughout the period of follow-up. During cloister, symptoms also were scored by interview, nasal secretions were quantified and nasal washings were performed for viral culture. Results showed that 19 (95%) subjects in the active-treatment group and 18 (90%) subjects in the placebo-treatment group shed virus. Symptomatic colds were observed in 63% of the active-treated and 83% of the placebo-treated subjects. Symptoms increased on Day 1 and peaked at Days 4 to 5. Detrimental changes in other measured functions consistent with those previously reported were observed. During the period of treatment, significant differences in the average symptom scores favoring the active-treatment group were observed for sneezing. Also, weight of expelled secretions was greater and mucociliary clearance rate less on some cloister days for the placebo-treated group. No significant differences between treatment groups in the objective measures of nasal congestion or the response of the middle ear and eustachian tube were documented.\r"

  ".W": "We report the preliminary 3-month outcome of a multicenter randomized trial of cryotherapy for treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Transscleral cryotherapy to the avascular retina was applied to one randomly selected eye when there was threshold disease (defined as five or more contiguous or eight cumulative 30 degree sectors [clock hours] of stage 3 ROP in zone 1 or 2 in the presence of \"plus\" disease). An unfavorable outcome was defined as posterior retinal detachment, retinal fold involving the macula, or retrolental tissue. At this writing, 172 infants had been examined 3 months after randomization. An unfavorable outcome was significantly less frequent in the eyes undergoing cryotherapy (21.8%) compared with the untreated eyes (43%). While the surgery was stressful, no unexpected complications occurred during or following treatment. These data support the efficacy of cryotherapy in reducing by approximately one half the risk of unfavorable retinal outcome from threshold ROP.\r"

  ".W": "Unsupervised use of intoxicating drugs almost certainly causes relapse to addiction in persons who have been chemically dependent. Other drugs may predispose some persons to failure in their attempt to remain drug-free. Studies have shown that the chemically dependent are addicted to intoxication, not to one particular chemical, so these persons must be guided away from psychoactive drugs that have any risk of producing intoxication. In some cases, such as during hospitalization, relapse-producing agents may be necessary. With close attention from the physician and the patient's acceptance of his or her addiction and active participation in a self-help group, relapse can usually be avoided. Benefits that are gained from counseling are often underrecognized. The physician who takes time to intervene in this way probably has fewer relapses among his or her chemically dependent patients than the physician who orders a prescription. Prescribing any drugs to these patients must be done with caution. In general, all intoxicating substances are contraindicated outside the hospital. The patient's use of any over-the-counter agent to produce weight loss, excitement, or sleep should serve as a warning signal to both the patient and physician.\r"

Antiserum directed against the conserved retroviral protease active site was used to identify pol precursor and processed species containing the presumed protease domain. The smallest product that accumulates is about 11 kDa as measured by NaDodSO4/PAGE. This size agrees with that predicted from the presence in this region of two Phe-Pro sequences, which is one of the cleavage sites recognized by HIV protease. DNA encoding only the predicted 11-kDa protein was cloned, bypassing the need for autoprocessing, and the protein was expressed to a high level in E. coli. This form is active as demonstrated by its ability to specifically cleave protease-deficient pol protein in vivo in E. coli. Extracts of E. coli containing the 11-kDa protease also process human immunodeficiency virus gag substrates in vitro. These results demonstrate that the 11-kDa protease is sufficient for enzymatic activity and are consistent with a major role for this form in virus maturation.\r"

The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 1860 units/mg and a molecular weight of 56,000. Comparison of the E. coli enzyme with the well-characterized rat kidney enzyme showed that these enzymes have similar catalytic properties (apparent Km values, substrate specificities, turnover numbers). Both enzymes are feedback-inhibited by glutathione but not by gamma-glutamyl-alpha-aminobutyrylglycine; the data indicate that glutathione binds not only at the glutamate binding site but also at a second site on the enzyme that interacts with the thiol moiety of glutathione but not with a methyl group. Both enzymes are inactivated by buthionine sulfoximine in the presence of ATP, suggesting a common gamma-glutamyl phosphate intermediate. However, unlike the rat kidney enzyme that has an active center thiol, the bacterial enzyme is insensitive to cystamine, gamma-methylene glutamate, and S-sulfo amino acids, indicating that it does not have an active site thiol. Thus, the rat kidney and E. coli enzymes share several catalytic features but differ in active site structure. If the active site thiol of the rat kidney enzyme is involved in catalysis, which seems likely, there would appear to be differences in the mechanisms of action of the two gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetases.\r"

For the most part, trees based on the retroviral enzyme sequences are congruent, indicating that extensive genetic recombination has not been a major factor in the evolution of the central part of the genome. In the case of envelope protein sequences, however, the sequences clearly exhibit evidence of multiple cross-over events between quite distantly related retroviruses. A composite phylogenetic tree was constructed from the four retroviral enzyme sequences, and a number of important historical happenings were interpreted in the light of the time scale it affords.\r"

The single cysteine at position 202, previously thought to be essential for rho function, was changed to serine or to glycine with no detectable effects on the protein's hexameric structure, RNA-binding ability, or ATPase, helicase, and transcription termination activities. A 151-residue amino-terminal fragment (N1), generated by hydroxylamine cleavage, and its complementary carboxyl-terminal fragment of 268 amino acids (N2) were extracted from NaDod-SO4/polyacrylamide gels and renatured. The N1 fragment binds poly(C) and mRNA corresponding to the rho-dependent terminator sequence trp t', but not RNA unrecognized by rho; hence, this small renaturable domain retains not only the binding ability but also the specificity of the native protein. Uncleaved rho renatures to regain its RNA-dependent ATPase activity, but neither N1 nor N2 exhibits any detectable ATP hydrolysis. Similarly, the two fragments, isolated separately but renatured together, are unable to hydrolyze ATP. Sequence homology to the alpha subunit of the E. coli F1 membrane ATPase, and to consensus elements of other nucleotide-binding proteins, strongly suggests a structural domain for ATP binding that begins after amino acid 164. The implications of discrete domains for RNA and nucleotide binding are discussed in the context of requirements for specific interactions between RNA-binding and ATP-hydrolysis sites during transcription termination.\r"

The dGTPase responsible for the increased hydrolysis has been purified to apparent homogeneity. Purification of the protein is facilitated by its high affinity for single-stranded DNA. By using this purification scheme an identical dGTPase has been purified from E. coli optA+. The purified proteins catalyze the hydrolysis of dGTP to yield deoxyguanosine and tripolyphosphate. The products of hydrolysis, chromatographic properties, denatured molecular mass of 56 kDa, N-terminal amino acid sequence, substrate specificity, and heat inactivation indicate that the proteins purified from optA1 and from optA+ cells are identical and identify the enzyme as the deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate triphosphohydrolase purified to homogeneity from wild-type E. coli [Seto, D., Bhatnagar, S.

Nine glycolytic enzymes are the major protein components of the glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei long-slender bloodstream forms. Glycosomal proteins are believed to be synthesized in the cytoplasm and inserted across the glycosomal membrane posttranslationally. We have developed an in vitro protein import assay for the study of glycosomal biogenesis in T. brucei. All nine glycosomal glycolytic enzymes were detectable by immunoprecipitation and gel analysis of radiolabeled products derived from in vitro translation of total mRNA. Radiolabeled translational products were incubated with purified glycosomes isolated from bloodstream forms and digested with protease to remove proteins not imported into glycosomes. Gel analysis of reisolated glycosomes revealed that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12) and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (EC 2.7.2.3) were apparently imported intact into the glycosome. Specificity of the protein import assay was verified by using translational products derived from cloned genes encoding T. brucei glycosomal PGK and its 95% homologous cytosolic isozyme. Glycosomal PGK was inserted into the glycosome in vitro with a 27.6% efficiency, but no imported cytosolic PGK was detectable. Preliminary data suggest that certain sequences between the N terminus and residue 123 may be important for import of glycosomal PGK. Our assay, combined with the potential use of genetically altered substrate proteins, may provide the opportunity to explore the recognition systems involved in glycosome biogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "88190119\r", 
  ".W": "Desmoplakins (DPs) I and II (approximately equal to 240 and approximately equal to 210 kDa) are major components of the internal portion of the desmosomal cytoplasmic plaque. Desmosomes play a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion and serve as specific attachment sites for cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. Although DP-I and -II are closely related molecules, their structure (i.e., amino acid or DNA sequence) has not been determined. In addition, it is not known whether these proteins are derived from one or more genes or whether they result from posttranscriptional or posttranslational events. This paper describes the isolation and characterization of eight DP cDNA clones from a bovine lambda gt11 expression library. Fusion proteins from six of these clones selected antibodies that reacted with DP-I and -II and two selected antibodies that reacted with DP-I alone. Antibodies made against fusion protein produced by the DP1A clone reacted specifically with DP-I and -II on immunoblots. When used for indirect immunofluorescence on bovine tongue cryostat sections and cultured mouse keratinocytes, these antibodies produced a typical desmosomal staining pattern. RNA blot analysis demonstrated hybridization of three DP-I/II cDNA probes with two messages of approximately equal to 7.5 and approximately equal to 9.5 kilobases in bovine tongue RNA. In contrast, a cDNA clone that affinity-purified antibodies reacting with DP-I only hybridized exclusively with the 9.5-kilobase band. Southern blots of genomic DNA digested with a panel of restriction enzymes were hybridized with one probe derived from a DP-I/II clone and with one from a DP-I clone. Both probes hybridized with single bands of the same size in each digested sample of DNA. Together, these data suggest that DP-I and DP-II are translated from two separate messages in bovine tongue and that these messages may be derived from a single gene.\r"

Blot-hybridization analysis of RNA prepared from mouse testis and epididymis as well as from rat epididymis confirmed the presence of a 1.3-kilobase (kb) NGF mRNA in these tissues. In the rat testis, however, only a 1.5-kb NGF mRNA was found, corresponding in size to a minor NGF mRNA detected in the rat brain, heart, and epididymis. By using affinity-purified anti-NGF antibodies, NGF-like immunoreactivity was observed in germ cells of rat and mouse testis and in the lumen of epididymis. Extracts of both mouse epididymis and testis stimulated fiber outgrowth in cultured sympathetic ganglia, and the effect was blocked by antibodies to mouse NGF. A two-site enzyme immunoassay showed the presence of 10 and 70 ng of NGF per g of tissue in the mouse testis and epididymis, respectively. Furthermore, RNA blot analysis showed the presence of mRNA for the NGF receptor in mouse testis. These results suggest a nonneurotrophic role for NGF in the male reproductive system, possibly in survival maturation and/or motility of spermatozoa.\r"

By immunofluorescence microscopy it could be demonstrated that in sperm tails from Lytechinus pictus all three anti-tektins stain all nine axonemal doublet microtubules and A-tubule extensions along their entire length. In addition to staining doublet microtubules, anti-tektin C weakly labeled the central-pair microtubules in sperm tails from Patiria miniata. The anti-tektin staining revealed also a clear cross-reaction with basal bodies of sea urchin sperm and with centrioles of cells from hamsters, humans, and pigs.

One allele is the previously characterized TPR-MET oncogene and the other is found on a der(7)t(1;7)(q23;q32) marker chromosome. These data and in situ chromosomal hybridization analysis would indicate that MET and, therefore, the cystic fibrosis locus are located at bands q31-q32 on human chromosome 7. Using somatic cell hybrids, we show that the chromosome containing the TPR-MET oncogene is grossly rearranged and contains both the upstream and downstream portions of the MET protooncogene locus. These results demonstrate that the TPR-MET oncogene rearrangement involving chromosomes 1 and 7 is either due to an insertion of TPR sequences into the MET locus or is more complex. We also show that the upstream MET protooncogene locus is deleted on der(7), while the downstream portion is retained. We cannot exclude that this is due to an interstitial chromosomal deletion or to a more complex rearrangement, but if MET maps at the breakpoint in der(7), then the 3' end of the MET transcription unit should be oriented towards the centromere. We also show that other DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism markers tightly linked with the inheritance of cystic fibrosis are deleted on der(7).\r"

Unlike a similar gene conversion event involving the insertion of an optional 1143-base-pair intron, the mitochondrial 21S rRNA gene, which requires the action of a protein encoded by a gene within that intron, conversion of the var1 GC cluster does not require any protein product of the mitochondrial genome. We have detected double-strand breaks in the var1 gene in mitochondrial DNA isolated from unmated haploid rho+ and rho- strains at or near the boundaries of the optional GC cluster, as well as at a conserved copy of that sequence 160 base pairs upstream. No double-strand breaks were detected in the recipient var1 DNA molecules in the vicinity of the optional GC cluster target sequence. This contrasts with 21S rRNA-encoding DNA (rDNA) intron conversion where the recipient, but not the donor DNA, is cleaved at the element insertion site. These results suggest that although the 21S rDNA intron and the var1 GC cluster are preferentially inserted into their respective short alleles, these conversions probably occur by different mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The yeast his3 promoter region contains two distinct classes of \"TATA elements,\" constitutive (TC) and regulatory (TR), that are defined by their interactions with upstream promoter elements, selectivity of initiation sites, and chromatin structure. TC is localized between positions -83 and -53, and TR is localized between positions -55 and -35, regions in which there are several TATA-like sequences. In this study, we used saturation mutagenesis to examine the structural requirements of the his3 TR element necessary for transcriptional induction. To avoid the complications of redundant elements, the phenotypic analysis was carried out by using a gal-his3 hybrid promoter whose function depends on a short oligonucleotide containing the prospective his3 TR element. In this context, an oligonucleotide containing the sequence TATAAA is sufficient for TR function. However, 17 out of the 18 possible single-base substitutions and 9 out of 10 double mutations of this sequence abolish TR function. This strict sequence requirement for TR function strongly suggests that the TR element is a target site for a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. Further, as the region encoding TC and promoters of certain other yeast genes do not contain a sequence that is compatible with TR function, we suggest that yeast cells contain multiple proteins with distinct sequence specificities that carry out a related \"TATA function\" and that yeast promoters can be divided into classes based on their downstream promoter elements.\r"

  ".W": "In yeast meiosis, ascosporal colonies are sometimes sectored for a marker--i.e., half the colony has one allele and half has the other. This is interpreted as replicative resolution of heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) formed as a recombination intermediate. We have looked for similar evidence of hDNA formation during mitotic recombination between two repeated sequences on the same chromosome. The two repeats, an ochre suppressor and a wild-type tRNA gene, are separated by plasmid DNA and the URA3 marker. Recombination between the repeats excises the URA3 gene and one copy of the repeat, leaving either the wild-type tRNA or the suppressor on the chromosome. A red/white color assay is used to distinguish between the two. We find that some colonies that have lost the URA3 gene are sectored for the suppressor. This suggests that hDNA is formed across the anticodon during the recombination event and then resolved by replication. The disruption of either of two genes involved in recombination and repair, RAD1 and RAD52, does not significantly alter the frequency of sectored colony formation during plasmid excision.\r"

Beef insulin differs from pork insulin by only two amino acids in the A-chain loop, yet strain C57BL/10 (B10) mice produce insulin-specific antibodies after immunization with beef insulin and fail to produce antibody after stimulation with pork insulin. Nevertheless, pork insulin primes helper T cells in B10 mice that can be demonstrated if insulin-specific Lyt-1-, -2+ suppressor T cells are removed. Not only do the pork insulin-primed helper and suppressor T cells cross-react with autologous insulin, but also rat insulin (the amino acid sequence of which is identical to mouse insulin) elicits functionally identical helper and suppressor T cells. In this report, we demonstrate that in B10 mice the frequency of helper T cells stimulated by pork insulin is equivalent to that stimulated by beef insulin and that helper T-cell clones induced by beef and pork insulin are major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cells that proliferate, produce lymphokines, and provide helper activity after activation. These helper T-cell clones exhibit different antigenic fine specificities: beef insulin-induced clones respond to beef insulin but not pork or autologous insulin, whereas pork insulin-induced clones cross-react with all species of insulin tested, including rat insulin. In addition, the helper activity of cloned pork insulin-specific T cells is abrogated by pork insulin-primed suppressor T cells. These data support the hypotheses that Ir gene control of antibody responses to certain antigens involves mechanisms used for maintenance of self-tolerance.\r"

Prior to GM-CSF infusion, AIDS patients' neutrophil superoxide generation and neutrophil antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity were enhanced normally by in vitro exposure to GM-CSF. Neutrophil phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus were also normal in the majority of these patients. Two patients, however, had discrete neutrophil functional defects: one in phagocytosis and one in intracellular killing. During the period of GM-CSF infusion, these abnormalities were corrected. The number of circulating neutrophils increased in all patients treated with GM-CSF in a dose-dependent manner. Neutrophils produced in vivo in response to GM-CSF administration functioned normally and there was evidence for neutrophil priming and activation in vivo. We conclude that GM-CSF treatment of AIDS patients leads to the production of functionally active neutrophils, suggesting therapeutic potential for GM-CSF in the treatment of patients with impaired host defense.\r"

  ".W": "The cell-surface glycoprotein Mo1 is a member of the family of leukocyte cell adhesion molecules (Leu-CAMs) that includes lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and p150,95. Each Leu-CAM is a heterodimer with a distinct alpha subunit noncovalently associated with a common beta subunit. Leu-CAMs play crucial roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We describe the isolation and analysis of two partial cDNA clones encoding the alpha subunit of the Leu-CAM Mo1 in humans and guinea pigs. A monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the guinea pig alpha chain was used for immunoscreening a lambda gt11 expression library. The sequence of a 378-base-pair insert from one immunoreactive clone revealed a single continuous open reading frame encoding 126 amino acids including a 26-amino acid tryptic peptide isolated from the purified guinea pig alpha subunit. A cDNA clone of identical size was isolated from a human monocyte/lymphocyte cDNA library by using the guinea pig clone as a probe. The human clone also encoded a 126-amino acid peptide including the sequence of an additional tryptic peptide present in purified human Mo1 alpha chain. RNA gel blots revealed that mature Mo1 alpha chain mRNA is approximately 5 kilobases in guinea pigs and humans. Southern analysis of DNA from hamster-human hybrids localized the human Mo1 alpha chain to chromosome 16, which has been shown to contain the gene for the alpha chain of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1. A comparison of the Mo1 alpha chain coding region revealed significant homologies with carboxyl-terminal portions of the alpha subunits of fibronectin, vitronectin, and platelet IIb/IIIa receptors. These data suggest that the alpha subunits of Leu-CAMs evolved by gene duplication from a common ancestral gene and strengthen the hypothesis that the alpha subunits of these heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules on myeloid and lymphoid cells, platelets, and fibroblasts are evolutionary related.\r"

These binding sites may represent a specific membrane receptor. These results, together with similarities in structural features between the precursors for epidermal growth factor and beta protein, suggest that the beta-protein precursor may be processed to release an active peptide ligand rather than acting as a membrane receptor. In Alzheimer disease, abnormal processing of this active peptide precursor may result in the deposition of beta-protein amyloid fibrils in the brain.\r"

  ".W": "Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurs in two molecular forms, those with and those without rearrangement of the breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 22. The molecular abnormality in the former group is similar to that found in chronic myelogenous leukemia. To characterize the abnormality in the breakpoint cluster region-unrearranged form, we have mapped a 9;22 translocation from the Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line SUP-B13 by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and have cloned the DNA at the translocation junctions. We demonstrate a BCR-ABL fusion gene on the Philadelphia chromosome. The breakpoint on chromosome 9 is within ABL between exons Ia and II, and the breakpoint on chromosome 22 is approximately equal to 50 kilobases upstream of a breakpoint cluster region in an intron of the BCR gene. This upstream BCR breakpoint leads to inclusion of fewer BCR sequences in the fusion gene, compared with the BCR-ABL fusion gene of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Consequently, the associated mRNA and protein are smaller. The exons from ABL are the same. Analysis of leukemic cells from four other patients with breakpoint cluster region-unrearranged Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed a rearrangement on chromosome 22 close to the breakpoint in SUP-B13 in only one patient. These data indicate that breakpoints do not cluster tightly in this region but are scattered, possibly in a large intron. Given the large size of BCR and the heterogeneity in breakpoint location, detection of BCR rearrangement by standard Southern blot analysis is difficult. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis should allow detection at the DNA level in every patient and thus will permit clinical correlation of the breakpoint location with prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-B) is transcribed in human atherosclerotic plaques, indicating that production of growth factors within plaques could occur during atherogenesis. However, since atherosclerotic plaques are composed of several cell types and three of these--macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells--can express the PDGF genes, the cell type responsible for PDGF gene expression was not clear. In the present study we explore further the expression of PDGF-A and -B and identify transcriptionally active cell types. We assayed PDGF-A and -B mRNA levels in dissected fractions of carotid atherosclerotic plaques and normal artery and then sequentially rehybridized these blots with three cDNA probes that recognize cell type-specific markers: fms for macrophages, von Willebrand factor for endothelial cells, and smooth muscle alpha-actin for smooth muscle cells. In plaques, PDGF-A expression correlated with smooth muscle actin; PDGF-B expression correlated strongly with fms. PDGF-A expression correlated with smooth muscle actin. In normal vessel wall, PDGF-A expression was high in the media and again correlated with smooth muscle actin, whereas PDGF-B expression was high in the adventitia. Since transcripts from both PDGF genes are found in normal artery where cell turnover is very low, we suggest that PDGF gene expression does not necessarily function to produce smooth muscle cell proliferation. We propose that these genes may have an important nonmitogenic, maintenance function in normal arterial tissue and in the atherosclerotic plaque.\r"

Expression of one or more virulence (vir) genes is temperature-regulated, wild-type strains being virulent (invasive) when grown at 37 degrees C but phenotypically avirulent (noninvasive) at 30 degrees C. A vir::lac operon fusion located on the virulence plasmid, which brings the lac genes under control of a temperature-regulated vir gene promoter, was used to select regulatory mutants constitutive for the Lac+ phenotype at the nonpermissive temperature. A transposon Tn10-induced mutant that was Lac+ at 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C was isolated, and the Tn10 insertion was transduced into a wild-type strain. The transductants all simultaneously became deregulated for virulence and invaded HeLa cells equally well at 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Other virulence-associated phenotypes were also deregulated and expressed at 30 degrees C. Southern hybridization with a probe for Tn10 determined the insertion to be on the chromosome. Fine mapping by transduction with phage P1L4 positioned the mutation between the galU and trp genes. A cosmid cloned fragment of Shigella chromosomal DNA containing the region around galU was used in complementation studies and showed that the closely linked regulatory gene was able to complement, in trans, the Tn10-induced mutation. We propose that this mutation defines a regulatory gene, virR, and that insertion of Tn10 into this gene inactivates a repressor that normally blocks expression of vir genes at 30 degrees C.\r"

Rapid currents that rose in 0.8-3.6 msec were evoked when glutamate was ionophoresed with 0.5- to 1.0-msec pulses. With prolonged pulses or brief, repetitive pulses, glutamate-evoked currents decayed rapidly in a manner that was independent of holding potential. A similar desensitization occurred following close-range pressure ejection of glutamate. The rapid, desensitizing glutamate current exhibited a linear current-voltage relation and it was not blocked by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, suggesting that it was mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate-insensitive (G2) receptors. Desensitization of G2 receptors may be agonist-dependent: currents evoked by kainate, a selective G2 agonist, did not decay, whereas prior application of glutamate did reduce the size of kainate responses. The appearance of the rapid current depended critically on the position of the ionophoretic pipette. Such glutamate-receptor \"hot spots\" often corresponded to points of contact with neighboring neurites, which raises the possibility that they are located at synapses.\r"

The region is the intermediate and medial part of the hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV). Previous studies have shown that training is associated with an increase in the area of the postsynaptic density of axospinous synapses in the left but not the right IMHV. The postsynaptic density is a site of high receptor density, and at least some axospinous synapses are excitatory. We found that imprinting is associated with a 59% increase in N-methyl-D-aspartate-sensitive binding of the excitatory amino acid L-[3H]glutamic acid in the left IMHV. The increase is probably due to an increased number of binding sites. The profile of sensitivity of the sites to a series of amino-, phosphono-substituted carboxylic acids (2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate to 2-amino-8-phosphonooctanoate) is characteristic of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type receptors. There were no significant effects of training on binding in the right IMHV. The effect of training on left IMHV binding could not be attributed to light exposure, arousal, or motor activity per se but was a function of how much the chicks learned. The changes in the left IMHV could increase the effectiveness of synaptic transmission in a region crucial for information storage and so form a neural basis for recognition memory.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and fifty consecutive patients with suspected appendicitis were examined with graded compression sonography. The initial diagnostic criterion for appendicitis was visualization of a noncompressible appendix; this was later modified to include the dimensions of the visualized appendix. The appendix was visualized in 91 of 250 patients (36%). Five adult patients with sonographically visible appendixes that were 6 mm or less in maximal diameter had either benign clinical follow-up (three patients) or a histologically normal appendix removed at surgery (two patients). However, two patients with appendixes measuring 6 mm in diameter and multiple appendicoliths had surgically confirmed acute appendicitis. Of 84 patients with visible appendixes measuring greater than 6 mm in maximal diameter, 78 had surgically confirmed acute appendicitis. In the remaining six, symptoms resolved spontaneously, and no surgery was required. In the absence of compelling clinical findings or an appendicolith, adult patients with maximal appendiceal diameters of 6 mm or less should undergo a period of close observation rather than immediate surgery. A diagnosis of appendicitis can be made in adult patients with persistent right lower quadrant pain and a visualized appendix greater than 6 mm in diameter.\r"

Three patients were investigated because of a previous abnormal US examination; in four the mass was an incidental observation. Sonograms were interpreted without knowledge of results from other procedures. Pancreatic masses were detected in 50 patients. Biliary and pancreatic duct obstructions were seen in 29 and 27 patients, respectively. Liver metastases were identified in 16 patients and missed in three that were not detected with either US or computed tomography. Vascular involvement was predicted in 12 patients and missed in four, while lymphadenopathy was seen in 16 and missed in five. Thirty-one cases of unresectable disease were correctly predicted with US. Resectability was not as accurately determined; only seven of 19 \"resectable\" lesions were successfully removed. US is an effective tool in the detection and preoperative evaluation of pancreatic malignancy.\r"

Biliary complications, particularly strictures at the choledochojejunostomy and debris in the intrahepatic and common ducts, were seen in six of ten liver transplant patients (60%) with preexisting sclerosing cholangitis; this is six times the frequency of biliary complications seen in other adult recipients (10%). Biliary complications were definitively diagnosed and managed with interventional radiologic procedures. Obstruction due to anastomotic strictures required treatment with balloon dilation in all six of the affected patients. Obstructive biliary complications occur in many liver recipients with preexisting sclerosing cholangitis. These complications require aggressive radiologic assessment and intervention but to date have not adversely affected survival.\r"

The authors reviewed the mammograms of these 400 cases without knowledge of the biopsy results and placed each examination into one of four groups based on their suspicion for carcinoma: minimal (n = 82), slight (n = 91), moderate (n = 174), and high (n = 53). In 127 cases, mammograms showed either minimally suspicious calcifications (n = 33) or minimally (n = 49) or slightly (n = 45) suspicious masses. A 4.7% (six of 127) rate of carcinoma was found in these groups; five of the six cancers were in situ. Had follow-up mammography been done rather than biopsy for these 127 less suspicious lesions, it is probable that the delay in diagnosis would not have altered overall prognosis. In the remaining 273 patients, the positive predictive value of mammography for carcinoma would have risen from 30% (119 of 400) to 41% (113 of 273). The authors conclude that in the management of suspicious nonpalpable mammographic findings, the rate of carcinoma for lesions at biopsy can approximate 40%.

These regional disparities form the foundation for a physiologic approach to the evaluation of diffuse lung disease. The pathologic-physiologic correlations in apical lung disease are examined, and a differential diagnosis is offered. Analysis of diffuse lung disease on the basis of radiologic-physiologic correlation is suggested as an aid in radiographic interpretation.\r"

The lemon sign was noted in 32 (64%), including 24 of 27 (89%) fetuses evaluated before 24 weeks. The presence of both ventricular dilatation, found in 41 (82%) of the fetuses, and a lemon sign correctly predicted spina bifida in all but one case. The location of the spinal defect and other anomalies were not associated with the lemon sign. The lemon sign is an important indicator of spina bifida, particularly in high-risk pregnancies, and should improve sonographic detection of spina bifida before 24 weeks.\r"

Its hemodynamic and electrocardiographic (ECG) effects were compared with those of a conventional ionic contrast agent (sodium meglumine diatrizoate). There were 40 patients in each group. The radiographic quality and incidence of adverse reactions were comparable for both agents. Following left ventriculography, there was a smaller decrease in systemic and left ventricular systolic blood pressure and a smaller increase in heart rate and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (P less than .05) with ioversol than with meglumine diatrizoate. There was also a slight decrease in cardiac output with ioversol at 1 and 3 minutes after left ventriculography, while meglumine diatrizoate produced a modest increase. In selective coronary angiography, the fall in diastolic blood pressure was also greater (P less than .05). The Q-T interval was more prolonged with meglumine diatrizoate. Ioversol appears to be both safe and efficacious for cardiac angiography, causing fewer and less severe hemodynamic and ECG alterations than meglumine diatrizoate.\r"

Surgical intervention followed in two patients, one with a multiloculated pseudocyst that was incompletely drained and another with a pseudocyst that became infected following drainage. In one patient with metastatic tumor to the head of the pancreas the pseudocyst resolved initially, but a pseudocyst later recurred. There were no pancreaticocutaneous fistulas or other major complications. The transgastric route of pseudocyst drainage is safe and effective, and it offers a low risk of recurrence and fistula formation.\r"

Since the echogenicity of tendon has been used to define normality and abnormality, certain knowledge of the normal echogenicity of tendon is crucial. Fresh tendon and muscle from beef hock was scanned with sector- and linear-array-transducer imaging at multiple angles and distances. The echogenicity of tendon was found to be very angle-dependent, a characteristic known as anisotropy. Scanned perpendicular to its long axis with a linear-array transducer, tendon was significantly more echogenic than muscle. With a change in angle, echogenicity of tendon decreased relative to that of muscle (the echogenicity of muscle remained the same), becoming isoechoic at angles of 2 degrees -7 degrees and hypoechoic at greater angles. Tendon studied with a sector transducer exhibited varying echogenicity. If echogenicity is used as a diagnostic criterion, the angle of the interrogating ultrasound beam must be very specifically defined.\r"

Evidence is presented that an enzyme of unknown structure [Ile-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase] may share a functionally important structural motif with an enzyme of related function (Tyr-tRNA synthetase). This approach involves (i) identifying segments of Ile-tRNA synthetase that have been unusually conserved during evolution, (ii) predicting the function of one such segment by assuming a structural relation between Ile-tRNA synthetase and Tyr-tRNA synthetase, and (iii) testing the predicted function by mutagenesis and subsequent biochemical analysis. Random mutations were introduced by cassette mutagenesis into a ten-amino-acid segment of Ile-tRNA synthetase that was predicted to be involved in the formation of the binding site for isoleucine. Few amino acid substitutions appear to be tolerated in this region. However, one substitution (independently isolated twice) increased the Michaelis constant Km for isoleucine in the adenylate synthesis reaction by greater than 6000-fold, but had little effect on the Km for adenosine triphosphate, the apparent Km for tRNA, or the rate constant kcat.\r"

Mammary carcinomas induced by a single carcinogenic insult in pubescent rats was selected as an in vivo model system with direct relevance to human breast cancer. Acquisition of hormone-independent growth in these carcinogen-induced tumors was found to be independent of the activation of ras oncogenes during the early stages of carcinogenesis. In agreement with these observations, introduction of a human ras oncogene into human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells did not abrogate their hormonal dependency for growth in vivo. These findings suggest that those events responsible for the critical stages of breast cancer development occur independently and in an uncoordinated manner.\r"

Selective variceal decompression has emerged as the best surgical option to balance bleeding control and maintenance of liver function. Survival is significantly improved at five years in nonalcoholic (75%) compared with alcoholic (45%) cirrhotic patients. Recent advances have modified the operative technique to better maintain portal perfusion. Total shunts stop bleeding, and may be used in emergencies. Devascularization procedures have a 20% to 40% rebleeding rate, but do not accelerate liver failure. Liver transplantation, which is increasingly indicated for patients with end-stage liver disease and variceal bleeding, is dictated by the degree of hepatic failure. To provide optimal patient care, a center should be able to offer all of the treatment methods.\r"

Infections were both community-acquired and nosocomial. A proven or suspected history of aspiration was present in six patients. Preexisting medical conditions were noted in all patients, the majority having multiple predisposing factors, which included alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Three patients died of their acute pulmonary infection. Based on in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing, aminoglycoside therapy would seem appropriate in the treatment of these infections.\r"

In the group of 30 controls, sonography via the right parasternal approach showed the anterior mediastinum in 29 (97%) and the subcarinal space in 27 (90%). Fifteen (94%) of 16 anterior mediastinal tumors and 16 (94%) of 17 subcarinal tumors were identified sonographically.

Thirty patients with recurrent hyperparathyroidism were evaluated by MR with both T1- and T2-weighted images. Twenty-six and 23 of these patients, respectively, also had thallium-201 scintigraphy and high-resolution sonography. For the 28 patients who eventually had surgical exploration and histologic evidence of adenoma (21 cases) or hypoplasia (seven cases), MR accurately located abnormal parathyroid glands in 75% evaluated prospectively and 89% evaluated retrospectively. Scintigraphy located 68% prospectively and 76% retrospectively. Sonography detected 57% prospectively and 67% retrospectively. For patients undergoing three studies, the prospective and retrospective detection rate was significantly better (p less than .05) for MR compared with sonography but was not significantly different for MR and scintigraphy. MR detected three of four mediastinal adenomas evaluated prospectively and retrospectively. One false-positive case was seen with MR, one with scintigraphy, and one with sonography. Thus, MR can be used to locate abnormal parathyroid tissue at a rate equal to or better than scintigraphy or sonography.\r"

In the four cases in which CT was performed, both the cyst and high-density linear intrabiliary material were seen; in three patients, cyst wall rupture was detected. Sonographic and CT demonstration of a hydatid cyst in the liver together with intrabiliary hydatid material suggests rupture of the cyst into the biliary tree.

Results were correlated with cystoscopy or surgery. Sonography accurately gauged change in 29 instances (83%), of which 13 showed increase, four decrease, and 12 stability of tumor. Errors in assessing interval change occurred when surgery between sonograms caused secondary bladder deformity or patchy edema of the bladder wall; these were misinterpreted as tumor growth. When smooth bladder thickening was present, sonography could not differentiate flat tumor from edema. In no case in which the bladder wall was normal on sonography was tumor found. In four cases sonography was a more accurate indicator of depth of tumor than cystoscopy was. These results suggest that sonography is a useful adjunct to cystoscopy and may be a dependable means of decreasing the frequency of invasive procedures to evaluate the extent of bladder disease. The use of these two techniques together may improve the accuracy achieved by using cystoscopy alone.\r"

CT scans were evaluated for shape and density of the mass, pelvocaliceal displacement, effect on the renal sinus fat, and the presence of perirenal involvement. Sonograms were evaluated for the shape and echogenicity of the mass and for the effect on the renal sinus echoes. Findings of infiltrative growth included poorly defined margins of the mass; trapped, nondisplaced infundibulae; and calices with occasional calicectasis, diminished contrast enhancement, occasional nephrographic striations, replacement of central sinus fat, loss of central sinus echoes, and variable renal parenchymal echogenicity. The reniform shape was usually preserved and was present in 19 of 20 cases with CT and 13 of 15 cases with sonograms. These observations indicate that analyses of the margins, architecture, and effects on the collecting system and renal sinus by the mass are helpful in the diagnosis of those diseases that characteristically infiltrate the kidney.\r"

Because surgery distorts landmarks, an understanding of the surgical procedures and their characteristic sonographic appearances is essential. After acromioplasty, the characteristic sharp margination or the acromion was replaced by a less distinct, irregular surface. After repair of a cuff tear, characteristic sonographic appearances included visualization of a reimplantation trough and loss of the echogenic subdeltoid bursa. When the cuff was intact after surgery, echogenicity was abnormal in all cases (17 shoulders). Sonography accurately diagnosed recurrent cuff tears in all 26 shoulders in which surgical proof was available and confirmed an intact cuff in 10 of 11 cases. In one shoulder, a cuff hematoma was incorrectly interpreted as a full-thickness tear. These findings suggest that sonography is an effective procedure for evaluating a postoperative patient with recurrent shoulder symptoms.\r"

The observed IPHs were categorized in five general groups: classical grade-IV hemorrhage (16 patients), grade-IV hemorrhage with coexisting but anatomically separate hemorrhages (four patients), grade-IV hemorrhage with later development of secondary parenchymal hemorrhages at distant sites (five patients), hemorrhagic periventricular leukomalacia (four patients), and parenchymal hemorrhage unrelated to grade-IV hemorrhages (six patients). Thirty IPHs had concurrent germinal matrix hemorrhages, but in only 16 patients did the IPH represent an extension of the subependymal hematoma and therefore qualify as pure grade-IV hemorrhage according to the most popular classification. The high concurrence of periventricular leukomalacia (80-100% in most groups) and germinal-matrix-remote IPHs supports the concept that most IPHs in preterm neonates represent secondary hemorrhages into ischemic brain tissue.\r"

Laser thermal angioplasty was performed with the first commercially available laser system on 25 atherosclerotic vascular lesions in 20 lower extremities of 18 patients. Fifteen of the lesions were occlusions (average length, 5.6 +/- 3.1 cm), and 10 were high-grade stenoses (average length, 2.6 +/- 1.8 cm). Indication for angioplasty was claudication limiting life-style in 12 extremities and threatened limb loss in eight. All patients were treated with a 1.5- or 2.0-mm metal-capped optical fiber attached to a 14-W argon-ion laser. Balloon angioplasty was performed after laser recanalization in all successful cases. The patients were followed by Doppler ankle/brachial index and clinical evaluation. Laser thermal angioplasty was technically successful (vessel recanalization) in 18 (90%) of 20 of the cases. Fourteen (70%) of 20 extremities were successes by ankle/brachial index follow-up, while 15 (75%) of 20 remained clinically improved after an average follow-up of 7.8 +/- 5.3 months. Laser thermal angioplasty has a technical and clinical success rate that compares favorably with previous reports of balloon angioplasty. With proper patient selection, laser thermal angioplasty can reduce the difficulty of traversing lesions that are amenable to standard balloon angioplasty and increase the number of vascular lesions that can be treated percutaneously but could not be recanalized without the use of laser energy.\r"

Seventy-three sonograms of the groin in 60 patients (65 different groins) were reviewed retrospectively to determine the accuracy of duplex Doppler sonography in distinguishing femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (a surgical condition) from other causes of groin masses (e.g., hematomas) that are generally treated conservatively. Nineteen cases of pseudoaneurysm, 19 cases of hematoma, and 27 other conditions were studied. Of the 73 sonograms performed, 53 included duplex Doppler studies; one Doppler study was false-negative and two were possibly false-positive. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of duplex Doppler sonography in the detection of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm was 95 +/- 5.8%, 94 +/- 6.4%, and 94 +/- 6.4%, respectively (95% confidence limit). We conclude that duplex Doppler sonography is of value in the differential diagnosis of groin masses.\r"

However, the clinical outcome of patients with silent myocardial ischemia has not yet been clearly defined. In a study of 356 patients with documented coronary disease--211 of whom had previous myocardial infarction--the prognostic information of spontaneous ST-segment depression was found to be independent of that associated with a positive exercise test result, ejection fraction, and extent of arteriographically documented coronary artery disease. Patients with asymptomatic ischemia had a higher coronary event rate than those without ischemia. Cardiac event rates followed a similar pattern for patients with silent, symptomatic and mixed ischemia--whether or not there was previous myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The results of current investigation suggest that a former clinical standby, namely, the presence or absence of angina, is no longer the principal prognostic factor for determining a patient's risk of cardiac events, including myocardial infarction. In a retrospective analysis, patients with chronic stable angina were compared on the basis of presence or absence of angina during ischemia detected by thallium imaging. Patients were similar in terms of risk factors, clinical characteristics and catheterization data. At 30 months of follow-up, the myocardial infarction rate was 22% in the silent group compared with 4% in the group with angina. Transient asymptomatic ischemia has prognostic value independent of other variables such as exercise stress testing or cardiac catheterization data. Future prognostic studies should be careful to include patient populations with similar characteristics; they also will need to provide protracted follow-up and utilize sensitive and reproducible diagnostic techniques.\r"

Studies show that thallium scintigraphy is more sensitive than exercise electrocardiography in detecting ischemia, i.e., in part, because perfusion defects occur more frequently than ST depression and before angina in the ischemic cascade. Thallium-201 scintigraphy can be performed to differentiate a true- from a false-positive exercise electrocardiographic test in patients with exercise-induced ST depression and no angina. The development of technetium-labeled isonitriles may improve the accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging.\r"

In patients with ST-segment elevation, evidence of these ST \"fingerprint\" patterns are associated with elevated risk for coronary events in the postangioplasty period. Such risk is not seen in patients with ST-segment depression or with no ST changes. The increased monitoring capability afforded with digitized 3- or 12-lead monitoring creates new criteria for what constitutes accurate determination of total ischemic burden.\r"

There is good evidence to suggest that patients with asymptomatic ischemia have defective pain perception compared with those with angina; however, the precise role of the endorphin and enkephalin systems in this phenomenon remains to be elucidated. Possible sources for disparate study results include variation in patient populations, insensitive or improperly timed assay techniques, and differences in amount of ischemia.\r"

To facilitate the analysis, the tumors were divided into four groups by light microscopy: (1) typical leiomyomas comparable to peripheral leiomyomas (n = 9); (2) cellular spindle cell tumors (n = 29); (3) round cell tumors (\"leiomyoblastomas\" n = 7); and (4) sarcomas (n = 11). The typical leiomyomas were desmin- and MA-positive throughout, and showed well-differentiated smooth muscle cells by electron microscopy, similar to the normal gastric smooth muscle cells. All esophageal leiomyomas belonged to this group. Nineteen of 29 of the Group 2 tumors showed desmin positivity and 20 of 29 showed MA positivity, but usually only in less than 10% of the tumor cells, and in many instances it was very difficult to determine whether the positive cells were real tumor cells or entrapped muscle cells. Only 5 of 29 of Group 2 tumors showed widespread desmin positivity and 11 of 29 showed similar MA positivity. Of round cell tumors, only 1 of 7 showed desmin-positive cells and 3 of 7 MA-positive cells. None of the sarcomas showed desmin, while MA positivity was found in 6 of 11 cases, often in a large number of tumor cells. Seven tumors showed a significant number of S-100 positive tumor cells, but four of these also showed a high number of desmin- and MA-positive cells, suggesting that these tumors represented complex proliferations of muscle and Schwann cell elements. Two purely S-100 positive benign probably Schwann cell-like tumors were found, both in the small bowel. Small number of S-100 positive cells were commonly found in GIST, and these probably represented entrapped Schwann cells, because many tumors showed simultaneous proliferation of non-neoplastic nerves.\r"

ALP in germinoma cells was generally located on the cell surface. In a few germinoma cells, however, ALP was seen not only on the cell membrane but also in the endoplasmic reticulum. Enzymohistochemically as well as biochemically, ALP in germinoma cells was little sensitive to L-phenylalanine, moderately sensitive to L-homoarginine and somewhat resistant to heat in its inhibition tests. Immunohistochemical examinations and electrosyneresis showed the presence of the placental type of ALP in germinoma cells and biochemical analyses revealed that the heat-stable component of ALP in germinoma cells was consistent with the D-variant of the placental type of ALP. Therefore, germinoma cells possessed mixed isoenzymes of ALP, consisting mainly of the liver/bone type and a small amount of D-variant of the placental type on the cell surface. The prominent expression of ALP in germinoma cells may be due to the enhanced expression of gonadal genes active in the germinoma genome.\r"

Cell cycle analysis of malignant gliomas revealed a higher mean percentage of S and G2M cells compared to well differentiated astrocytomas but there was considerable overlap between histologic subtypes. Nuclear antigen analysis of diploid tumors showed a higher mean p105 fluorescence of S + G2M cells than G0G1 cells from the same case but there were no apparent differences in p105 expression by histologic subtype. Aneuploid tumors showed enhanced expression of p105 relative to diploid cells. The findings suggest that the aggressive course of high grade glial tumors may be related to an abnormal DNA stemline or an increase in proliferative activity.\r"

  ".W": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the colon occurs in immunocompromised patients and in patients with ulcerative colitis. In the former, it can cause serious bleeding or colonic perforation and in the latter, it may precipitate a fulminant phase of illness. The authors compared the immunoperoxidase technique with a monoclonal antibody (Mab) against CMV early antigen and DNA in situ hybridization using a biotinylated probe in the identification of virus-infected cells in colon samples from patients with known CMV colitis and with fulminant ulcerative colitis without histologic evidence of infection. The Mab stained the nuclei of infected cells without recognizable viral inclusions particularly in cases showing few characteristic viral inclusions. In well-developed CMV infections, with many inclusions, immunoperoxidase staining was less prominent. The biotinylated DNA probe recognized cytopathic cells with prominent inclusions but was only rarely positive in smaller cells. In specimens with few inclusions, there was no staining with in situ hybridization. No positivity was observed by either technique in cases of fulminant ulcerative colitis with no morphologic evidence of CMV infection. The authors conclude that immunoperoxidase using monoclonal anti-CMV early antigen adds useful information in the evaluation of early or focal cases of CMV colitis. DNA in situ hybridization is usually positive in cytopathic cells and is less useful for diagnosis. CMV could not be demonstrated in cases of fulminant ulcerative colitis when viral inclusions were not observed in routine preparations.\r"

Identical changes were found in regional lymph nodes. In addition to silver stains and electron microscopy, an immunohistochemical method for the demonstration of P. carinii was employed. The technique may have advantages over silver staining, as it identifies trophozoites in addition to cysts. A review of the literature concerning extrapulmonary pneumocystosis indicates that affected patients nearly always have concurrent pulmonary infection. The pattern of organ involvement and the finding of perivascular and intravascular organisms are consistent with lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination from the pulmonary focus. Pulmonary pneumocystosis was not documented in the patient described herein, although there were radiographic densities in one pulmonary lobe.\r"

On the other hand, morphologic evaluation is difficult in flow cytometric or frozen section studies. A simplified three-step plastic embedding system using acetone-fixed tissues embedded in glycol-methacrylate (GMA) resin has been found to provide both excellent morphologic and antigenic preservation. With our system, a wide variety of antigens are detected in plastic sections without trypsinization or prolonged embedding procedures; pan-B (CD19, CD22), pan-T (CD7, CD5, CD3, CD2), T-subset (CD4, CD8, CD1, CD25) markers as well as surface immunoglobulin and markers for myeloid and mononuclear-phagocyte cells are preserved. In summary, modifications of plastic embedding techniques used in this study simplify the procedure, apparently achieve excellent antigenic preservation, and facilitate evaluation of morphologic details in relation to immunocytochemical markers.\r"

Ki67 monoclonal antibody was used by combined immunohistochemical methods together with antibodies recognizing macrophage- and T-cell-subset-related antigens using avidin-biotin peroxidase (ABC) and alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) systems. Many proliferating Ki67+ cells were found in affected mediastinal lymph nodes. These cells were mainly located around granulomas and exhibited phenotypical markers of helper/inducer T cells (CD3+, CD4+). Ki67+ macrophages could not be detected in the same lesions with this technique. A different picture was found in BAL preparations where proportions of both T lymphocytes and macrophages were Ki67+. The presence of replicating lymphocytes could be correlated to disease activity, whereas the proportions of Ki67+ macrophages did not show significant differences between active and inactive disease. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) expression was investigated in the same samples with a specific antiserum. Epithelioid macrophages in granulomas and BAL macrophages in all cases exhibited cytoplasmic staining revealing an activated status. Interestingly, giant cells in granulomas were mainly devoid of IL-1 immunoreactivity. These studies support the concept that activated cells at different sites of ongoing inflammation play a central role in the mechanisms accounting for granuloma formation.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes the immunohistochemical staining properties of four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (CF, EB, AD, and KB) which had been previously shown to be specific for purified neuron-specific enolase (NSE) by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. In this study, the authors immunostained a spectrum of normal and neoplastic neuronal, \"neuroendocrine,\" and nonneuronal tissues fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Positivity was generally restricted to normal neuronal structures and neuronal tumors, including adrenal neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, carotid body paraganglioma, duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma, and teratoma with neuroepithelial components. Three staining patterns of the normal or neoplastic neuronal structures were observed: two MAbs (CF and EB) stained predominantly the nerve fibers (axoplasm); one (AD) stained predominantly the cell bodies (perikaryon); and one (KB) stained both the axoplasm and the perikaryon. \"Neuroendocrine\" tumors such as pulmonary small cell carcinoma, pancreatic islet cell tumor, thyroid medullary carcinoma, and carcinoid tumors from various locations showed a variable staining pattern. Tumor cells undergoing mitotic division were usually positive regardless of type. Normal structures other than neuronal or \"neuroendocrine,\" including normal glial cells, were negative. The authors also studied a range of glial cell tumors with MAbs CF and AD as well as with Dako polyclonal antiserum to NSE. The results showed that CF stained the axonal fibers in the normal white matter surrounding these tumors; it did not stain the tumor cells or the perikarya of neurons in the surrounding normal gray matter. AD stained the glioma cells as well as the perikarya and dendrites of neurons in the surrounding normal gray matter; it did not stain the axonal fibers in the surrounding normal white matter. By contrast, the polyclonal antiserum stained all of these structures. The high degree of staining specificity of the MAbs should prove them to be valuable in immunohistochemical diagnosis of tumors as well as in further understanding the role of NSE in neuronal differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the synthesis of renin in human pathologic tissues, the authors used in situ hybridization to detect and localize renin messenger RNA (mRNA). The probe was a 35S-radiolabeled 1.1-kb length complementary DNA of human renal renin. To compare the synthesis with the presence and the storage of renin, renin antigen was assessed by immunohistochemistry in the same tissues. The human pathologic tissues were as follows: two ischemic kidneys related to renovascular hypertension; two renal juxtaglomerular cell tumors; one extrarenal renin-secreting epithelioid sarcoma of soft tissues. In ischemic kidneys, the cells containing both renin mRNA and renin protein were found in numerous juxtaglomerular apparatus and in the wall of arterioles, shown by combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Most of the tumor cells in the juxtaglomerular cell tumors and scarce tumor cells in the epithelioid sarcoma of soft tissues were positive by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. These findings demonstrate that the presence of renin in these tissues is associated with local cellular production of renin. In particular, smooth muscle cells of the wall of arterioles are definitely capable of synthesizing renin. Moreover, in these tissues, gene expression (renin synthesis) and renin storage are concordant.\r"

In marked contrast, clearly stainable bone iron was noticed in all 4 biopsy specimens from the iliac crest and in 11 of 15 vertebral bone fragments obtained at autopsy from individuals with verified primary or secondary hemochromatosis. Findings, including results obtained in vitro, suggest that a positive Prussian blue reaction at the surface of trabecular bone signals the presence of low-molecular-weight (\"free\") iron, which can bind to the osteoid matrix directly, ie, without the help of osteoblasts. Stainable bone iron may thus be a useful criterion for early detection of hemochromatosis and other types of potentially toxic iron overload.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to increase the sensitivity of the staining reaction for the T antigen on the surface of neoplastic cells grown in vitro with the use of site-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The authors describe anti-peanut agglutinin (PNA) MAbs selected by screening the hybridomas with PNA and PNA bound to bovine serum albumin conjugated with the T antigen. The selected hybridomas (F2C8, F3D12, F3A5) were then grown in pristane-sensitized mice or in the Amicon Hollow Fiber System (F2C8). The affinity constant values for PNA were measured, and all the purified MAbs were tested on both native and denatured PNA, wheat germ agglutinin, concanavalin A, and ricin by using the immunoassay dot test and immunoblotting methods. Eleven different cell lines were stained with the three MAbs; similar results were obtained with F2C8 and F3D12. In each case the fluorescence, if present, was associated with the cell membrane, and the intensity of the staining was always stronger when the cells were incubated with the MAbs than when stained with fluorescein-labeled PNA. On the other hand, F3A5 failed to stain unfixed cells preincubated with PNA but stained the same cells after fixation, independently of the presence of PNA. One of the antibodies, F2C8, was used to stain histologic preparations from 27 cases of Hodgkin's disease and was compared with the anti-granulocyte antibody, Leu-M1, which has been used by numerous authors to identify the characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells. The results obtained were qualitatively similar; ie, F2C8 was at least as efficient as anti-Leu-M1 in its ability to stain the typical diagnostic cells in Hodgkin's disease.\r"

The alternative pathway functions as a form of innate humoral immunity by attacking membranes not having the characteristics of self-membrane. In addition, the alternative path provides amplification after triggering by either path. Absence or dysfunction of many of the components is associated with autoimmune or immunodeficiency disease. Absence of the inhibitor C1INH is associated with the unique syndrome of hereditary angioedema.\r"

Fasting insulin levels were similar; peak insulin levels stimulated by meals or intravenous glucagon fell by 30% and 39%, respectively. Plasma and erythrocyte content of omega-3 fatty acid rose significantly. After omega-3 fatty acid withdrawal, fasting glucose returned to baseline. Omega-3 fatty acid treatment in type II diabetes leads to rapid but reversible metabolic deterioration, with elevated basal hepatic glucose output and impaired insulin secretion but unchanged glucose disposal rates.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind comparison of active treatments. SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center. PATIENTS: One hundred ninety-eight consecutive hypercalcemic events in 164 patients screened for entry. Eligibility criteria: hospitalization and intravenous hydration for at least 2 days; persistent elevated serum calcium levels of 2.99 mmol/L or greater (adjusted for serum albumin); serum creatinine levels of 221 mumol/L or less; no cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, or mithramycin within the preceding 7 days or during study; no concurrent use of aminoglycoside antibiotics; life expectancy greater than 4 weeks; lymphoma and parathyroid carcinoma excluded. Patients were stratified by histologic type of tumor (epidermoid or nonepidermoid). Fifty patients were randomized and treated. INTERVENTIONS: Gallium nitrate 200 mg/m2 body surface area for 5 days by continuous intravenous infusion, or salmon calcitonin 8 IU/kg body weight every 6 hours for 5 days by intramuscular injection. Patients randomized to receive gallium nitrate received sham injections of saline to simulate calcitonin; patients randomized to receive calcitonin received 1000 mL 5%-dextrose solution to simulate gallium nitrate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients were evaluable. Eighteen of twenty-four patients who received gallium nitrate achieved normocalcemia compared with 8 of 26 patients who received calcitonin for an observed difference of 44% (95% confidence interval, 19% to 69%; P = 0.002). Median duration of normocalcemia before other cytotoxic or hypocalcemic therapy was 6 days for patients treated with gallium nitrate compared with 1 day for patients treated with calcitonin (P less than 0.001). Median duration of normocalcemia regardless of intercurrent treatment and without adjustment for serum albumin was 11+ days for patients treated with gallium nitrate and 2 days for patients treated with calcitonin (P less than 0.01). Mean daily fluid intake and mean daily dose of furosemide were similar in both treatment groups. No additional benefit was seen in 9 patients randomized to receive calcitonin who incidentally received corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Gallium nitrate therapy is highly effective and superior to maximally approved doses of calcitonin for acute control of cancer-related hypercalcemia.\r"

A positive proliferative test was defined as a stimulation index of more than five on two determinations. The sensitivity of this test was 100% in the 14 patients with definite chronic beryllium disease. The specificity of the test was also 100% among the normal volunteers and the 16 patients with sarcoidosis. The test was positive in none of the four patients with biopsy evidence of non-beryllium disease, none out of two patients with lower lobe fibrosis suggestive of non-beryllium disease, and all of three patients with probable chronic beryllium lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: the proliferative response of bronchoalveolar lymphocytes to beryllium appears to be a useful test for chronic beryllium disease.\r"

Despite the Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, attempts to establish spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines from peripheral blood lymphocytes and to immortalize cord lymphocytes with throat washings were unsuccessful due to a marked cytopathic effect. The supernatants from the cultures induced cytopathic effect in cultured cord lymphocytes, MRC-5 cells, A-549 cells, or Vero cells. Virus particles with adenovirus morphology were seen by electron microscopy. Using type-specific antisera, the isolate was identified as adenovirus type-2. In addition, both Epstein-Barr virus and adenovirus type-2 genomes were seen in the colonic tissues and spleen. These results suggest that the combination of Epstein-Barr virus and adenovirus type-2 may be etiologic agents in the development of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection in this patient.\r"

Recent studies have more clearly defined the clinical manifestations of C. trachomatis infections, especially mucopurulent cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease. In addition, methods for the direct detection of chlamydial antigen in genital secretions have been developed. Although less sensitive than traditional cultural methods, these noncultural methods are more widely available than cultures and can facilitate the earlier recognition and more specific diagnosis of chlamydial genital infections. This article reviews these recent developments and outlines specific applications of tests for diagnostic purposes and for screening of high-risk populations.\r"

For example, the prevalence and severity of osteoporosis can be reduced significantly by the use of estrogen, with or without added progestin, in postmenopausal women. A common and devastating problem of frail elderly persons is urinary incontinence, most cases of which can be classified without referral for urologic services. Appropriate treatment can improve nearly half of all cases of persistent incontinence. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is effective in guiding the treatment of frail elderly patients and leads to significantly improved outcomes under appropriate conditions. The advent of the teaching nursing home has shed light on the medical problems of elderly residents of nursing homes, including malnutrition, dysregulation of water and electrolyte balance, falling, cognitive and affective illnesses, behavior disturbances, infections, and pathogenic drug use. The future application of advanced technology may revolutionize nursing home care.\r"

  ".U": "88192143\r", 
  ".W": "A new antimetabolite, 2'-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin), has striking antitumor activity in several lymphoid neoplasms. Isolated from cultured soil organisms, this purine analogue is a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), and is thus selectively toxic to lymphocytes. Early clinical trials showed that high doses of pentostatin caused severe and unpredictable toxicity, but responses in refractory lymphoid malignancies were encouraging. Careful pharmacologic studies led to the definition of a safe and effective low weekly dose, at which protracted ADA inhibition occurs in neoplastic cells. The most sensitive tumor identified is hairy cell leukemia, in which durable remissions are achieved in more than 90% of patients with a relatively brief course of treatment. Other responsive diseases include chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and acute T-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Response has been seen in acute lymphocytic leukemia, but the higher doses required are substantially more toxic. Pentostatin is valuable for treatment of indolent lymphoid malignancies and may be useful in non-cancer-related lymphocyte research.\r"

Alprazolam was found to be effective and well tolerated. There were significant alprazolam-placebo differences in improvement for (1) spontaneous and situational panic attacks, (2) phobic fears, (3) avoidance behavior, (4) anxiety, and (5) secondary disability, all significant by the end of week 1. At the primary comparison point (week 4), 82% of the patients receiving alprazolam were rated moderately improved or better vs 43% of the placebo group.

In this study, 126 patients with panic disorder and phobic avoidance received either alprazolam or placebo in doses of 2 to 10 mg daily for eight weeks. The medication was tapered over a period of four weeks, and patients were observed for another two weeks after all medication was discontinued. Sixty of the 63 alprazolam-treated patients and 49 of the 63 placebo-treated patients entered the taper and discontinuation study. After improvement in the active treatment period, the alprazolam-treated group had significant relapse between the first and last week of taper. However, during the second postdiscontinuation week, outcome scores were not significantly different from those of the placebo-treated group who did not deteriorate during taper. Twenty-seven percent of the alprazolam-treated group reported a rebound of panic attacks during taper and 13% reported a rebound of anxiety on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. No serious or life-threatening withdrawal symptoms were reported, but distinct, transient, mild to moderate withdrawal syndrome occurred in 35% of the alprazolam-treated group and in none of the placebo-treated group. The coexistence of symptom rebound and a withdrawal syndrome occurred in 10% of the alprazolam-treated group, but both subsided by the end of the second week without alprazolam. We recommend that patients with panic disorder be treated for a longer period, at least six months, and that medication be tapered over a more prolonged period, at least eight weeks, especially where high doses are employed.\r"

With this exclusion criterion, 31% of subjects had a secondary MDE occurring after the onset of the panic disorder. The occurrence of secondary MDE was related to the length of time subjects were ill with panic disorder. Compared with the subjects without depression, those subjects with current MDE had higher scores on measures of anxiety and depression but not on the number of panic attacks per week. The presence of depression and the degree of phobic avoidance contributed independently to measures of the severity of the panic illness. Alprazolam was effective in reducing panic and depressive symptomatology in both depressed and nondepressed subjects with panic disorder. The presence of an MDE was not predictive of the outcome of treatment for the panic and phobic symptoms. Subjects with or without depression responded similarly to alprazolam.\r"

For the clorazepate group, there was a suggestion that previous discontinuous exposure to benzodiazepines might sensitize patients to subsequent withdrawal effects. For the buspirone group, a higher dropout rate raised questions about patient satisfaction with therapy in this rather chronically anxious population.\r"

In autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, several autoantibodies have been identified that are associated with different disease subgroups and that may be helpful to distinguish this form of chronic active hepatitis from that caused by non-A, non-B agents. In primary biliary cirrhosis, antimitochondrial antibodies are almost invariably present and have now been characterized at the molecular level.\r"
