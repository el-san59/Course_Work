He previously failed to respond to conventional therapeutic modalities (partial hypophysectomy, pituitary irradiation, high-dose bromocriptine and a combination of streptozotocin and 5-fluorouracil) and was treated with long-acting somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995 (Sandoz, East Hanover, NJ). Growth hormone and somatomedin C concentrations became normal, and GHRH-LI (GHRH-like immunoreactivity) was suppressed by more than 60%. The growth hormone response to exogenous GHRH 1-40 was stopped and growth hormone rise to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was significantly attenuated. A significant shrinkage of the pituitary gland was observed. Similarly, the size of the metastatic carcinoid lesions decreased dramatically and was accompanied by a normalization of liver function. After almost 2 years of SMS 201-995 therapy, the patient was well and had no clinical signs of acromegaly. Thus, SMS 201-995 appears to be a remarkably effective agent for treatment of acromegaly secondary to ectopic GHRH secretion.\r"

Two studies, each with a treated and a control group, were performed. In the historical control study the postoperative 3-year survival rate of patients (73.7%) in the treated group (n = 38) was significantly higher than the survival rate (52.7%) of those in the control group (n = 55) (P less than 0.04). In the random control study the survival rate (83%) of patients in the treated group (n = 26) was also higher than that (67.3%) of those in the control group (n = 21) in the 30 months that followed gastric surgery. However, there was no significant difference. In the historical control study with respect to the postoperative complications, anastomotic leak was observed in 8.5% of patients who were given CHPP-M and 12.8% patients who did not have CHPP-M. In the random control study anastomotic leak was observed in 3.1% of patients who had CHPP-M and 7.1% of patients who did not have CHPP-M. The incidence of adhesive ileus in patients having CHPP-M did not increase in historical or random control groups. Postoperative prolonged intestinal paresis or chemical peritonitis were not induced by CHPP-M. These results indicate that CHPP-M is a simple, safe, and readily available prophylactic therapy for peritoneal recurrence that may follow gastric cancer surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms mediating the effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on the cardiovascular system were studied in the conscious rat. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of TRH (8 pmol-80 nmol/kg) induced dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac index. Hindquarter blood flow increased due to vasodilation, while an increase in renal and mesenteric vascular resistance caused a decrease in blood flow in the respective organs. The plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were increased by TRH, while there was no change in plasma renin activity or vasopressin. The cardiovascular actions of i.c.v. TRH were not influenced by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system or vasopressin receptors. The ganglion blocker chlorisondamine and the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine (2 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the increase in blood pressure and mesenteric vasoconstriction after i.c.v. TRH. Propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.) blocked the TRH-induced increase in cardiac index, heart rate, and hindquarter blood flow. The hindquarter vasodilation induced by TRH was also blocked by the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 188,551 (1 or 2 mg/kg i.v.), while the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker practolol (10 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect on the hindquarter vasodilation produced by TRH but totally blocked the increase in cardiac index. In adrenal demedullated rats, the systemic hemodynamic effects of i.c.v. TRH were diminished along with the decrease in renal blood flow and increase in renal vascular resistance; however, the increase in hindquarter blood flow was attenuated only in adrenal demedullated rats pretreated with the sympathetic blocker bretylium. The renal vasoconstriction induced by i.c.v. TRH was not abolished by renal denervation. In sinoaortic debuffered rats, the pressor, tachycardic, and mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses to centrally administered TRH were significantly potentiated. Taken together, these data suggest that the putative neurotransmitter TRH may play a role in central regulation of cardiac functions and organ blood flow distribution through both the sympathetic nerves and the adrenal medulla. A pivotal role for beta 2-adrenoceptors in mediation of hindquarter vasodilation is also demonstrated.\r"

Plasma ANP concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay, and quantitation of receptors was performed by computerized in vitro autoradiography with 125I-labeled alpha-rat ANP (1-28) as the radioligand. When compared with controls, rats with myocardial infarction had markedly elevated plasma immunoreactive ANP concentrations (462 +/- 82 versus 124 +/- pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and reduced densities of ANP binding in the inner renal medulla (2.93 +/- 0.19 versus 3.53 +/- 0.22 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.01). Extensive myocardial infarction was associated with a significant decrease in receptor numbers in the inner medulla (33.6 +/- 5.7 versus 95.6 +/- 9.6 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.01) without significantly altering the affinity constant (1.76 +/- 0.51 versus 1.03 +/- 0.15 x 10(9) M-1, p greater than 0.05). Right ventricular weight increased in proportion to infarct size (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01), and both were correlated with plasma immunoreactive ANP levels (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01 and r = 0.75, p less than 0.01, respectively). Binding densities in the inner medulla of rats with infarcts were negatively correlated with right ventricular weight, plasma immunoreactive ANP concentrations, and also with infarct size (r = -0.92, p less than 0.001; r = -0.78, p less than 0.001; r = -0.77, p less than 0.01, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Atriopeptin II has been reported to cause profound coronary vasoconstriction in the isolated perfused guinea pig heart and in the blood perfused canine heart. Consequently, this study was carried out to examine possible mechanisms by which vasomotor effects of human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) occur in the canine coronary circulation. Bolus dosages of ANP were administered into the left circumflex coronary artery of in situ dog hearts perfused at constant flow rate. ANP produced dose-related coronary vasodilation with a threshold dosage of 2 ng/kg; a dosage of 2 micrograms/kg caused a 27 +/- 4% decrease in coronary vascular resistance. Coronary vasodilation produced by ANP was not altered by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). In addition, neither adenosine receptor blockade with 8-phenyltheophylline (5 mg/kg i.v.) nor cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.) significantly altered the response to intra-arterial ANP. These data demonstrate that in the in vitro blood perfused canine heart, ANP administered intra-arterially results in coronary vasodilation that does not utilize adenosine-dependent or prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms.\r"

Whether other ANF production sites are recruited in disease states exhibiting elevated plasma ANF levels is not known. Accordingly, in the cardiomyopathic hamster, an animal model of congestive heart failure with high circulating levels of ANF, contribution of ventricular tissue to total cardiac ANF production and storage was investigated. Measurements were made of immunoreactive ANF in plasma and in atrial and ventricular extracts as well as ANF mRNA levels in the atria and ventricles from normal and cardiomyopathic golden Syrian hamsters. Plasma ANF levels were higher in cardiomyopathic than in control animals. The atrial concentration of ANF (per milligram atrial weight) was 50% and 83% lower in moderate and severe congestive heart failure, respectively, when compared with controls, while atrial ANF mRNA content of cardiomyopathic hamsters was not significantly different from normal hamsters. The ventricular concentration of ANF was 3 times and 7 times higher in animals in moderate and severe heart failure when compared with controls. In severe heart failure, ventricular ANF accounted for 23% of total cardiac stores of ANF. Ventricular ANF mRNA levels were 7 times and 13 times higher in hamsters in moderate and severe heart failure as compared with control animals. Therefore, significant increases in both ANF content and ANF mRNA in ventricles of hamsters in moderate to severe heart failure suggest that the ventricle could be an important source of ANF in congestive heart failure.\r"

The inhibitory action of (+)-PN200-110 and nisoldipine on contractions evoked by potassium chloride depolarization was characterized by a pronounced time dependency, in which the inhibition increased slowly after depolarization to attain a steady-state value, while with (-)-PN200-110 and (+)-Bay K8644 the inhibition was almost instantaneous. To explain these observations, specific binding sites for dihydropyridines were studied in membranes isolated from rat aorta, using [3H](+)-PN200-110 as a radioligand. We found that the time course of the development of inhibition of potassium chloride-evoked contractions by various concentrations of (+)-PN200-110 paralleled the time course of [3H](+)-PN200-110 binding to isolated membranes and that the level of inhibition was predictable from the level of occupation of these binding sites. These results indicate that depolarization increases the affinity of calcium channels for dihydropyridines in vascular smooth muscle and that the time course of the inhibitory effect on contraction is determined by the time course of association with the high-affinity state of the channel.\r"

In a mechanically ventilated porcine preparation of ventricular fibrillation, onset of fibrillation was associated with a rapid decrease in ETCO2 from 4.0 +/- 0.2% to less than 0.7 +/- 0.2%. With precordial compression, it increased to 1.9 +/- 0.3%. Animals that were successfully defibrillated after 12 min of CPR demonstrated an immediate increase in ETCO2. The ETCO2 increased from 1.9 +/- 0.3% to 4.9 +/- 0.3% over an interval of between 30 and 60 sec. These changes in ETCO2 were closely related to proportionally similar decreases and increases in cardiac output (CO), and a close correlation between ETCO2 and CO was demonstrated (r = .92). A similar highly significant correlation between ETCO2 and CO was also demonstrated during open-chest cardiac massage (r = .95). ETCO2 therefore serves as a noninvasive measure of pulmonary blood flow and therefore CO. In 17 successfully resuscitated animals. ETCO2 during precordial compression averaged 1.7 +/- 0.2%, whereas it was only 0.5 +/- 0.1% in five animals in whom resuscitation procedures were unsuccessful (p less than .001). Accordingly, ETCO2 prognosticates outcome during CPR and immediately identifies restoration of spontaneous circulation.\r"

Groups II and III showed decreased (not significant) clearance of ethinyl estradiol. Tobacco use had no effect on steroid pharmacokinetics in the non-OC users. Although chronic OC use did not affect ethinyl estradiol clearance, a joint effect of tobacco/OC use on enhancing clearance of ethinyl estradiol appeared to occur.

High-dissociation equilibrium constant (20 pmol/1, receptor number 17 fmol/mg) and low-dissociation equilibrium constant (10 nmol/1, receptor number 5 nmol/mg) affinity binding sites for atrial natriuretic peptide have been identified in membrane preparations from rat mesenteric artery. 2. Tracer degradation was corrected for mathematically and binding data were analysed by a non-linear computer technique. 3. Non-atrial natriuretic peptide vasoactive hormones, angiotensin II, vasopressin and bradykinin, did not compete for the high-affinity site. Related peptides with either C- or N-terminal amino acids missing still competed, while peptides without an intact disulphide bridge did not compete. 4. Neither the addition nor the removal of calcium affected the affinity or density of binding sites. Also the non-hydrolysable guanosine triphosphate analogue 5-guanylylimidodiphosphate had no effect on either affinity or number of sites. 5. These results indicate the presence of a specific high-affinity vascular receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide which could interact with the hormone under physiological conditions. The mechanism of binding is uncertain but is unlikely to involve calcium- or guanosine triphosphate-associated regulatory sites.\r"

Body weight was significantly reduced, whereas blood pressure remained unaltered, 6 days after bile duct ligation when serum bilirubin had risen to 169 +/- 18 (SEM) as compared with 2.8 +/- 0.3 mumol/l in SO rats. When compared with control values before surgery, urinary volume had significantly increased and absolute excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride and phosphate had decreased on day 6 after CBDL. Endogenous creatinine clearance was markedly depressed when compared with SO rats. Whereas fractional excretion of potassium remained unaltered, fractional excretion of sodium and of phosphate was significantly increased. 3. Except for a significant increase in urinary thromboxane B2 (TXB2) excretion in CBDL rats, no significant changes were observed in urinary excretion of prostaglandin (PG) E2, in the synthesis of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 by isolated aortic tissue in vitro, nor in renal and cardiac adenosine triphosphatase activities or renal cortical mitochondrial function. 4. The adenosine triphosphate content of kidney cortex and cardiac mitochondrial function were significantly depressed in CBDL rats. 5. The results demonstrate that jaundice in CBDL rats is associated with functional and metabolic disturbances of the kidney and cardiac muscle, which may contribute to the renal and haemodynamic characteristics observed in jaundiced animals and humans.\r"

Because pregnancy, in women and rats, is also associated with an increased GFR, we studied PG biosynthesis by glomeruli isolated from pregnant rats in comparison with virgin rats at the different phases of the oestrous cycle. 3. PGE2 and PGF2 alpha synthesis markedly increased during pregnancy (at day 21 of gestation a five- to sevenfold increase of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha was seen; at day 15 of gestation a threefold increase of PGE2 and a sixfold increase of PGF2 alpha was noted). However, thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis was similar in all the groups studied. 4. Among the four phases of the oestrous cycle, dioestrus was characterized by a significant increase in glomerular synthesis of PGE2. 5. The fact that during pregnancy the increase in the vasodilator PGE2 is not counteracted by an increase in the constrictor TXA2 must be taken into account when explaining the glomerular hyperfiltration which characterizes the pregnant state. 6. The increase of PGE2 synthesis during dioestrus should be considered in studies of PG synthesis using virgin rats as controls.\r"

We have investigated the effect of the calcium antagonist verapamil upon the polycythaemic response to hypoxia in rats. 2. Control groups of 10 male rats breathed air in an environmental chamber for 28 days. Hypoxic groups breathed a normobaric atmosphere of 10% oxygen for 6 h each day, and air for the remaining 18 h. Control and hypoxic groups were treated with intraperitoneal or subcutaneous water, or with intraperitoneal or subcutaneous water plus verapamil. 3. On day 28, packed cell volume (PCV) was measured by a microhaematocrit technique and red cell mass (RCM) by dilution of injected 51Cr-labelled rat erythrocytes. 4. PCV and RCM were significantly higher in all the hypoxic groups compared with the control groups (P less than 0.01 in each case). 5. PCV and RCM were significantly lower in the hypoxic groups treated with intraperitoneal or subcutaneous verapamil than in the hypoxic groups treated with intraperitoneal or subcutaneous water (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences between PCV and RCM in verapamil- and water-treated normoxic control groups. Verapamil had no effect on the shift of the oxygen/haemoglobin dissociation curve produced by hypoxia. 6. Verapamil reduces the polycythaemic response to repeated intermittent hypoxia in rats. Venesection is usually performed for excessive secondary polycythaemia in man. Our results suggest a possible therapeutic role for verapamil in such individuals.\r"

For those who died (42 percent), the average payment per case was $11,418 below the average per discharge cost. In 1985, 241 Medicare patients treated in the MICU showed an average loss per discharge of $14,113, which rose to $20,271 for those who expired (39.4 percent). There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups and in type of patients per DRG assignment (p = 0.56 and p = 0.88, respectively) by Chi-squared test. Despite the 1984 DRG experience, there was no change in admission practices or utilization of MICU beds during 1985.

  ".W": "Human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) is stored by granules of both human atria. Atrial distension appears to be a major stimulus for hANP secretion. Precapillary pulmonary hypertension increases right ventricular afterload and may thus cause right atrial distension. We therefore hypothesized that hANP plasma concentrations (1) are higher in the right atrium than in the peripheral vein, (2) are increased in patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension, and (3) correlate with right atrial pressure. Thirty-three adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial fibrosis were examined by right heart catheterization. Mean pressures were measured in the right atrium, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge position, and blood was drawn from the right atrium and from a peripheral vein for determination of hANP levels. In general, hANP plasma levels in the right atrium were significantly higher than in a peripheral vein. Seventeen out of 33 patients had pulmonary hypertension, whereas 16 patients exhibited normal pulmonary artery mean pressures. In all patients, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure was normal. Plasma hANP concentrations were significantly higher in patients with pulmonary hypertension than in patients with normal pulmonary artery pressure. A strong correlation between central or peripheral hANP plasma levels (or both) and mean right atrial pressure could be observed (r = 0.75; p less than 0.001). From these data, we conclude that the increased secretion of hANP in our patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension appears to be mediated by right atrial distension.\r"

Heart rate, systolic and mean blood pressures, cardiac output, oxygen consumption (VO2), and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) all increased during CPT. Decreases in arterial pH and VE and increases in PaCO2 were also observed. The higher, but not lower dose, of fentanyl significantly attenuated increases in blood pressure and heart rate during CPT and no substantial hemodynamic changes occurred once CPT had stopped.

The elemental diet is cheaper, simpler and safer. Uncontrolled clinical experience with 77 patients showed that personalized food exclusion diets were associated with an average annual relapse rate of only 11% for the first five years of diet alone; there have been six pregnancies and the longest remission is now 75 months.

  ".W": "Despite the extensive use of sulfasalazine (SAS) and/or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and, more recently, rheumatoid arthritis, their mode of action has not been elucidated so far. None of the numerous pharmacological and biochemical effects described, including immunosuppressive, antifolate, and modulatory actions on lymphocyte and leukocyte functions, could be defined unequivocally as mediating their beneficial activity. Recently, interest has focused on actions of SAS and 5-ASA on the various enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade. Mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease generates excessive amounts of cyclooxygenase products such as prostaglandins (PG) as well as 5-lipoxygenase products such as leukotriene (LT) B4 and sulfidopeptide-LT. Both PG and LT exert proinflammatory actions and are potentially important mediators of mucosal inflammation. SAS and 5-ASA, however, have been found to inhibit PG synthesis under certain experimental conditions only, while increasing PG formation under other conditions. While SAS was found to inhibit colonic LTB4 synthesis, 5-ASA was reported to selectively affect the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonate metabolism in this tissue. Our results demonstrate that, like the parent compound, the metabolite 5-ASA in a dose-dependent manner inhibits release of LTB4 and sulfidopeptide-LT from normal human colonic mucosa (IC50 3.5 and 3.7 mmol/liter, respectively). Indomethacin, which has no efficacy in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, on the other hand, selectively inhibited PGE2 formation in normal and inflamed colonic mucosa (IC50 1.7 and 1.0 mmol/liter, respectively) without reducing synthesis of LTB4 or sulfidopeptide-LT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Growth failure represents a common, serious complication unique to the pediatric age group. Although the etiology of growth failure is multifactorial, malnutrition due to inadequate nutrient intake is the primary cause. Recent studies have demonstrated that nutritional supplementation through an enteral or parenteral route restores body composition and reverses linear and ponderal growth failure. The development of elemental diets that can be administered nasogastrically at home has afforded a more practical, less expensive, and less hazardous method of providing Crohn's disease patients with nutritional supplementation and bowel rest. Elemental-diet therapy has also been shown to be a safe, effective method of inducing a remission in acute Crohn's disease. Further studies are required to develop optimal nutritional therapy which may sustain long-term remission in this disease.\r"

How dietary therapy works is conjectural but it appears to play a fundamental role, perhaps by removing intraluminal factors that can induce or maintain inflammation. Eicospentaeoic acid competes with arachidonic acid metabolism and decreases the production of chemotactic factors and, from a small pilot study, may have a therapeutic role in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of purified 31 kilodalton (kDa) bovine inhibin on the basal release and cell contents of FSH and LH in pituitary cells from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats have been investigated for periods up to 28 days in tissue culture. A constant rate of basal FSH release (1.90 +/- 0.24 ng/10(6) cells.h) was observed during the first 10 days of culture and this release was blocked by inhibin in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.16 U/ml, IC100 greater than 2.5 U/ml). The constant basal LH release between days 2 and 12 of culture (0.15 +/- 0.02 ng/10(6) cells.h) was also blocked by inhibin in a concentration-dependent manner to a minimum of 25% of control (IC50 = 0.66 U/ml, ICmax greater than 6 U/ml). FSH and LH cell contents decreased exponentially in the presence and absence of inhibin over the first 20 days of culture permitting the calculation of decay half-times (t1/2). Inhibin reduced the FSH cell content t1/2 from 5.0 to 1.8 days and the LH cell content t1/2 from 5.8 to 3.6 days (IC50 = 0.81-0.83 U/ml, ICmax greater than 6 U/ml for both FSH and LH). The sum of the FSH released and FSH cell content (i.e. total FSH) increased with time in culture and this increase was blocked by inhibin. In contrast, total LH decreased with time in all cultures. The data suggest that in pituitary cells separated from hypothalamic and gonadal inputs 1) inhibin primarily suppresses tonic FSH synthesis coupled to its basal release; 2) at higher concentrations inhibin partially suppresses basal LH release and promotes intracellular degradation of FSH and LH. Thus, based on differences in sensitivity, inhibin acts at two or more sites, one associated with FSH tonic synthesis-basal release and the other(s) with FSH/LH mobilization and/or degradation.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates granulosa cell (GC) proliferation of certain species and modulates FSH-induced GC differentiation. The present study was undertaken to characterize the binding properties of the EGF receptor in porcine GCs to determine if the EGF responsiveness of mitotically active porcine GCs was related to their differentiated state and was regulated by reproductive hormones in vitro. Characterization of the EGF receptor-binding properties of porcine GCs revealed that saturation binding was achieved with 10 ng/ml [125I]iodo-EGF after 1 h at 37 C. In all states of differentiation, porcine GCs expressed few (less than 20,000/cell), specific, high affinity EGF receptors with apparent Kd values of 5.5 +/- 0.7 X 10(-10) M (mean +/- SEM; n = 6). Freshly harvested GCs obtained from small follicles were considered slightly differentiated (SDs) and bound, on the average, 2.6-fold more [125I]iodo-EGF than highly differentiated cells (HDs) obtained from large follicles which had further differentiated in vivo. The difference in binding was due to a decrease in receptor number and not to a change in receptor affinity. This relationship observed in freshly harvested cells was maintained in culture for a limited period. At 48 h of culture, the [125I]iodo-EGF-binding capacity of SDs was higher than that of HDs and was inversely related to the state of differentiation, as measured by [125I]iodo-LH/hCG-binding capacity. After 96 h, however, the EGF-binding capacity of HDs increased 3.7-fold from the level of binding at 48 h, while the LH/hCG-binding capacity decreased 10-fold. Conversely, the EGF-binding capacity of SDs decreased 28%, while the LH/hCG-binding capacity remained low. These experiments indicated that the state of GC differentiation was inversely correlated with EGF receptor number and that this relationship was not maintained in culture beyond 48 h. FSH treatment within the first 48 h of culture decreased the EGF-binding capacity of SDs 35% relative to the control value, but estradiol and dihydrotestosterone had no effect. FSH also regulated the mitotic responsiveness to EGF. EGF treatment of cultured SDs stimulated an 84% increase in cell number and a 178% increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. These effects were suppressed by a high concentration of FSH. Thus, the ability of porcine GCs to bind EGF was changed with differentiation in vivo, while both EGF-binding capacity and mitotic responsiveness were regulated by exposure to FSH in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "TRH induces two separate events in pituitary PRL cells. It increases the release of stored PRL and enhances the rate of PRL gene transcription, which results in an increased steady state concentration of PRL messenger RNA (mRNA) and a concomitant augmentation of PRL production. The mechanisms underlying the release process involve the activation of phosphatidylinositol turnover which generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol. In order to determine whether these intracellular messengers also mediate the stimulation of PRL gene expression by TRH, we have correlated the level of receptor occupancy with the rate of gene transcription and investigated the action of drugs which increase cytosolic calcium or activate protein kinase C. We have determined that sustained stimulation of transcription requires the persistent occupancy of a limited number of TRH receptor sites and that the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), calcium ionophores (A23187, ionomycin), and the calcium channel agonist BAY K 8644 enhance PRL gene transcription. However, TPA is less potent and ionomycin requires a low concentration of TPA to fully mimic TRH action, whereas BAY K 8644 alone displays the same potency as TRH. The effects of BAY K 8644 and TRH are not additive and thus suggest that the influx of calcium plays a predominant role in the regulation of PRL gene transcription by TRH.\r"

Five-day-old rats were injected daily between the 5th and 11th days of life with test substances and killed on day 15. Administration of testosterone propionate (TP; 2.5 mg daily), human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG; 7.5 IU daily), or coadministration of both of these substances (TP + hMG) or administration of estradiol benzoate (15 micrograms daily) caused quantitative changes in premeiotic spermatogenesis, as measured by the mean cell counts per tubule cross-section. hMG caused an increased yield of type A1 spermatogonia (SgA1) from undifferentiated type A spermatogonia (UnA) and increased the yield of type B spermatogonia from SgA1. TP was not effective in stimulating first premeiotic spermatogenesis, and in contrast to hMG, it had a negative influence on the numbers of UnA and SgA1 and on the volume of Sertoli cell nucleus. Administration of TP + hMG or estradiol benzoate resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of UnA and SgA1, but inhibited cell differentiation. TP + hMG significantly reduced the rate of premeiotic spermatogenesis. The results demonstrate that precocious numerical stabilization of premeiotic spermatogenesis can be achieved by the application of hMG. TP applied alone was able to induce peripheral androgenic effects (seminal vesicle weight) 100% greater than those produced by administration of hMG, but was not able to stimulate seminal tubule function. TP applied together with hMG produced inhibition of spermatogenesis. This effect might be due to the inhibition of Sertoli cell function by the direct influence of testosterone. In contrast to testosterone, estradiol may play a stimulatory role in the multiplication of the reserve stem cells of the first spermatogenesis of the rat.\r"

Baroreceptor denervation produced significant decreases in basal ANP levels and osmotic induced release (P less than 0.01). Plasma ANP increased from 25 +/- 3.2 to 136.8 +/- 28 in the sham-operated rats and from 11.8 +/- 2.6 to 30.8 +/- 4.6 in the SAD. Plasma sodium was the same in the 2 groups, and there was no change in atrial ANP content. Blood pressure was elevated in the denervated animals; however, the pressor response to the hypertonic challenge was not different from the controls. These results suggest that the baroreceptor system may have important influences on cardiovascular/hormonal regulation.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously identified a group of cytoplasmic phosphoproteins (proteins 1-11) whose phosphorylation could be related, on a pharmacological basis, to the multihormonal regulation of PRL synthesis and release in the anterior pituitary tumor-derived GH cell lines. Phosphoproteins with identical migration properties on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels were also detectable in normal rat anterior pituitary cells in culture. We designed appropriate culture and [32P] phosphate-labeling conditions allowing to analyze the regulation of the phosphorylation of these proteins in normal pituitary cells. TRH, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and vasoactive intestinal peptide induced the same qualitative changes in phosphorylation of proteins 1-11 in normal as in GH cells. Quantitative differences observed are most likely due to the heterogeneity of primary pituitary cultures. Phosphorylation changes affecting proteins 14-16, not previously detected in GH cells, were also observed with normal anterior pituitary cells. GH cell lines have lost the sensitivity of pituitary lactotrophs for dopamine, an important physiological inhibitor of PRL synthesis and release. In normal anterior pituitary cells in culture, dopamine inhibited also the TRH-stimulated phosphorylation of proteins 1-10, thus strengthening the correlation between phosphorylation of these proteins and multihormonal regulation of pituitary cell functions. Our results indicate: 1) that the same phosphoproteins as in GH cells are related to the multihormonal regulation of nontumoral, normal anterior pituitary cells in culture; 2) that dopamine acts by interfering with the phosphorylation of these proteins. The phosphoproteins described here are therefore likely to be part, in normal anterior pituitary cells and possibly in other cell types, of the intracellular machinery involved in the cascade of transducing events leading from the binding of extracellular signals to the regulation of their target biological functions.\r"

The adenosine receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline antagonized the effect of NECA, shown by a shift in the dose-response curve to the right. The stimulatory effect of NECA was also seen in an ovarian membrane preparation, where NECA stimulated adenylate cyclase in both the presence and absence of FSH. The stimulatory effect of NECA was also decreased by 8-phenyltheophylline in this preparation. The A1-receptor agonists N6-(R-phenyl-isopropyl)-adenosine (R-PIA) and N6-(S-phenyl-isopropyl)-adenosine (S-PIA) both inhibited FSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The inhibitory effects of R-PIA and S-PIA, but not the stimulatory effects of NECA, could be counteracted by dipyridamole, a nucleoside transport inhibitor. Furthermore, R-PIA and S-PIA inhibited adenosine uptake into granulosa cells. Thus, the inhibitory effects of R-PIA and S-PIA are not likely to be mediated via membrane-bound inhibitory A1-adenosine receptors. Neither the stimulatory effects of NECA nor the inhibitory effects of R- and S-PIA could be attributed to changes in ATP levels, since the ATP levels were unaffected by these analogs. The results of this study indicate the existence of stimulatory A2-adenosine receptors in preovulatory rat granulosa cells and suggest a membrane-associated modulatory role of adenosine in preovulatory granulosa cells.\r"

Sodium valproate in doses of 20, 200, and 600 mg/kg was administered by rapid intravenous infusion to male guinea pigs 3, 21, and 42 days old. Serum levels of VPA were determined by gas chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated based upon a two-compartment model. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased out of proportion at the 600 mg/kg dose level in all groups. Other pharmacokinetic changes were as follows: in 3-day-old guinea pigs, the slow disposition rate constant (beta), the elimination rate constant from central compartment (K10), and the total clearance (Clt) were significantly decreased and the beta phase half-life (t 1/2) and the volume of central compartment (V1) were significantly increased at the 600 mg/kg dose level. In 21-day-old guinea pigs, beta and K10 were significantly decreased and t1/2 and V1 were significantly increased at doses of both 200 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg. In 42-day-old guinea pigs, however, only V1 and the volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) showed significant increase after increasing doses. The extraction ratio (E) and the clearance of unbound drug (Clu), which were calculated based on unbound plasma levels, indicate that the dose-dependent kinetics of VPA are probably due to saturation of metabolism and that the metabolic capacity for VPA in the newborn group is the smallest among all groups.\r"

CBZ and PHT levels rose within 24 h after NFM was started, and began to decline within 12 h after NFM was stopped. The inhibitory effect on CBZ metabolism persisted throughout the course of 1 year of long-term follow-up in all five patients who continued with the drug after completion of the pilot study. Inhibition of PHT elimination persisted in three of the patients, but PHT elimination returned to baseline rates in the other two patients during long-term follow-up. The inhibition of CBZ and PHT metabolism is probably due to binding of cytochrome P-450 by NFM or a metabolite and thus inhibition of the hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxidase system.\r"

Eight healthy volunteers received 400 mg PHT suspension after fasting (A), with hourly Ensure (B), and with 4-hourly Ensure (C) in a randomized, crossover design. Data obtained from 13 serum samples collected over 80 h were analyzed using ESTRIP. Area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax), and urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl) 5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH) were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni t tests of differences between means. AUCs (mg x h/L) were not different (p greater than 0.05) for A (222.1 +/- 86.9), B (233.9 +/- 92.9), and C (226.0 +/- 95.7). Tmax (h) was significantly shorter (p less than 0.05) when PHT was administered with Ensure (B = 8.5 +/- 3.0, C = 5.3 +/- 2.0) than without Ensure (A = 18.5 +/- 10.5). The HPPH excretion (mg/80 h) was not different (p greater than 0.05) for A (225.6 +/- 48.5), B (238.6 +/- 26.6), and C (229.9 +/- 45.6). Clearance and maximum concentration correlated with AUC, obviating the need for analysis. Relative bioavailability was B/A = 1.07 +/- 0.21, C/A = 1.01 +/- 0.14. The bioavailability of PHT was not decreased by either ENF administration schedule. Factors other than direct contact may be responsible for the observed decreases in PHT concentrations by coadministered ENFs.\r"

Monotherapy can improve seizure control as well as reduce the risk of serious idiosyncratic reactions, dose-related side effects, and complex drug interactions. Monotherapy also offers improved compliance and cost-effectiveness. The basis of monotherapy is accurate diagnosis and assessment of the patient's seizure type(s), followed by selection of a single appropriate anticonvulsant drug. Many patients currently treated with multiple anticonvulsants can be successfully converted to monotherapy with a carefully monitored program in which troublesome and redundant drugs are gradually withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen.\r"

In recent years, however, studies have shown that, for most patients, monotherapy can provide comparable or better seizure control than administration of multiple anticonvulsants, while diminishing the potential for adverse reactions, drug interactions, and poor compliance. Valproate is an important monotherapeutic agent that is highly effective in the control of idiopathic primary and secondarily generalized epilepsies, and partial seizures that do not generalize. Comparative studies have found that valproate is at least as effective as phenytoin and carbamazepine in the treatment of generalized and partial seizures. Given the similar efficacy, other factors such as pharmacokinetics and side effects may therefore determine anticonvulsant selection for monotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Virtually all of the major antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can cause hepatotoxicity, although fatal hepatic reactions are rare. The mechanisms, incidences, and risk profiles for such reactions differ from drug to drug. With carbamazepine and phenytoin, hepatotoxicity may be due to drug hypersensitivity. Although the profiles of patients at risk have not been well-defined for these two antiepileptic drugs, it would appear from reports in the literature that older adolescents and adults are at higher risk than children of developing serious or fatal hepatotoxicity. Once hepatotoxicity develops, mortality rates are 10-38% with phenytoin and 25% for carbamazepine. The risk profile for valproate fatal hepatotoxicity has been more clearly defined. Those at primary risk of fatal hepatic dysfunction are children under the age of 2 years who are receiving multiple anticonvulsants and also have significant medical problems in addition to severe epilepsy. The risk is considerably lower for patients over the age of 2 years on valproate monotherapy. In contrast to the risk profile with other AEDs, adults receiving valproate as monotherapy have the lowest risk of hepatotoxicity. Fatal hepatic dysfunction coincident with valproate may be the result of aberrant drug metabolism. Concomitant use of AEDs that induce microsomal P450 enzymes (e.g., phenytoin and phenobarbital) may enhance the production of a toxic metabolite, and hence the greater risk of hepatotoxicity with polypharmacy.\r"

  ".W": "Sodium valproate enteric-coated tablets were administered as monotherapy to 118 patients (median age, 19 years) with primary generalized epilepsies. More than half (56%) of these patients were transferred from prior drug therapy, most of them because of inadequate seizure control, and some because of adverse effects. Seventy-one percent of the patients experienced tonic-clonic seizures, either alone or in combination with other types of seizures, principally absences. Mean duration of follow-up was 18 months (median, 17 months; range, 1-68 months). At a mean daily dosage of less than 20 mg/kg, 83% of the patients became seizure-free. Therapy was equally effective against tonic-clonic seizures, absences, and myoclonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures were suppressed in 85% of cases (89% when patient had only one seizure type), absences in 82% (95% when patient had only one seizure type), and myoclonic seizures in 82%. Paroxysmal activity was present in 88% of the electroencephalogram (EEG) records before valproate monotherapy, and in 32.4% at the study's end. These results were achieved with generally mild and mostly transient side effects; side effects were reported by 16% of patients during the first month, and 2% at the last follow-up. No hematologic or hepatic toxicity was observed. The lag time between attaining steady-state serum concentrations and achieving maximal clinical improvement suggests that sodium valproate monotherapy should be given an adequate trial to ensure that patients derive the greatest possible benefit before adding or switching to another drug.\r"

None of these studies has demonstrated significant differences in antiepileptic efficacy between available antiepileptic drugs, but the results show that there are considerable individual differences between patients' responses to the same drug. While side effects are common with all of the antiepileptic drugs currently available, these are usually mild and reversible. Although some toxic effects may occur more frequently with certain drugs, there is sufficient overlap between the effects of various antiepileptic drugs that most side effects cannot be attributed with certainty to any one drug. Since side effects are generally dose-related, they can frequently be avoided or minimized by careful dosage titration and individualization of therapy.\r"

Although absence epilepsies are more common in children than adults, an estimated 80% of children with epilepsy have seizure types or epilepsies that are potentially responsive to carbamazepine. The differential diagnosis of ictal staring is an especially important issue in children because absence and atypical absence seizures are more prevalent in children than adults. Age-related pharmaco-kinetic differences and drug interactions are major considerations in children. On average, children have higher clearance rates of carbamazepine, shorter half-lives, and higher ratios of carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide to carbamazepine than adults. In addition, children with severe epilepsy are more likely to require multiple-drug therapy, which can lead to complex drug interactions. When carbamazepine is administered along with valproate, drug protein binding interactions can cause intermittent side effects.\r"

An earlier comparative study of carbamazepine and phenytoin by Ramsay and associates found both drugs equally effective in controlling new-onset seizures. Among the advantages of carbamazepine is that it causes relatively few cognitive and dysmorphic side effects. Its disadvantages are its unavailability in parenteral formulation and its metabolic autoinduction. The latter must be compensated for by planned dosage increases to maintain therapeutic plasma steady-state levels during the first 2 or 3 months of treatment. Carbamazepine is judged a drug of choice in the treatment of these secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and the drug of choice in children, adolescents, and women susceptible to the dysmorphic side effects associated with other anticonvulsant agents.\r"

Adhesiolysis was performed as needed for oocyte recovery. Ovarian access did not correlate with serum estradiol level on either the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration or the day after hCG administration. Similarly, neither the total number of follicles on the day of hCG or on the day after hCG, nor the number of follicles 1.0 to 1.4 cm or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm correlated with ovarian access. We conclude that periovarian adhesions are not a major determinant of the ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation.\r"

Peak E2 levels and ultrasonographic parameters of follicular development were comparable in the two treatment groups. Exogenous gonadotropin requirements were increased 2- to 4-fold in GnRHa pretreated cycles (P less than 0.05). Ovum recovery rates were not improved by adjuvant LA. These studies indicate that there was an increased ovarian requirement for exogenous gonadotropins as a result of GnRHa therapy. It has to be considered that this may be a direct effect of GnRHa upon the ovary. Alternatively, the absence of endogenous pituitary support in GnRHa-treated patients may account for the increased gonadotropin requirement. Finally, it is possible that this effect is indigenous to this select patient population of poor responders to menotropin stimulation, or to a specific effect of subcutaneously (as opposed to intranasally) administered GnRHa on the ovary. Further studies are needed to clarify the extent to which any or all of these postulated mechanisms may be influencing ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropins after subcutaneous GnRHa pretreatment.\r"

Ovarian vein E2 gradients were observed in 11 of the 12 patients with a mean of 13.4, whereas adrenal blood samples did not demonstrate significant E2 gradients. Seven of 8 patients exhibited ovarian secretion of E1, with a mean gradient of 13.6 times that of peripheral blood, whereas 4 of the 8 adrenal samples showed E1 gradients. The mean value was 1.4 times peripheral levels. No significant correlations were found between peripheral E1 levels and body weight or degree of adiposity, nor was there a relationship between obesity and E1/delta 4A molar ratio in peripheral blood. The subjects with the highest ovarian delta 4A levels had a significant correlation between peripheral delta 4A and E1. Therefore, our data indicate a significant contribution of ovarian E1 secretion to the peripheral E1 pool in addition to the extraglandular conversion of delta 4A to E1. There was general lack of correlation between peripheral E1 concentrations and plasma E2, and these relationships versus body size suggest that the major source of E2 in women with POD was ovarian secretion.\r"

To examine this hypothesis, 14 women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) and 3 volunteers were given DEX for 14 days. The PCOD group included obese and nonobese women (+/- 15% ideal body weight). Plasma determinations by radioimmunoassay of total testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, luteinizing hormone; follicle-stimulating hormone; cortisol, and SHBG were made.

All androgens were suppressed by DEX, with the exception of androstenedione post-DEX levels, which were significantly greater than pre-DEX levels in 6 of 14 subjects (P greater than 0.05).

This study evaluates whether a single daily measurement of serum P could reliably identify a spontaneous LH surge in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Eighty-four infertile women received either clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), or hMG alone. Serum P levels were increased significantly the morning of the day of an endogenous LH surge (P less than 0.01). A 2-fold rise in the serum P levels was associated with a predictability of 64.4% of a LH surge; however, a 4-fold increase in serum P could accurately predict a spontaneous endogenous LH discharge in 93.3% (P less than 0.001) of cases.\r"

In this study, male Lewis rats were injected intraperitoneally with CFA and 1 day later with low-dose STZ; these were repeated at weekly intervals for 3 wk. The incidence of diabetes mellitus (nonfasted plasma glucose greater than 200 mg/dl) in wk 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 50, 80, 93, and 100%, respectively. Rats receiving either CFA or STZ only did not develop diabetes. Injections of either the components of CFA (incomplete Freund's adjuvant and Mycobacterium butyricum), another granuloma-inducing organism (Listeria monocytogenes), or endotoxin before STZ induced diabetes, but the onset was slower and the diabetes was less severe than with CFA and STZ. Because intraperitoneal CFA injections caused peritoneal irritation, acute weight loss, and hypoglycemia on the day after injection, we examined whether fasting alone potentiated low-dose STZ. Fasting for 24 h before and 24 h after low-dose STZ caused diabetes that was similar in rapidity of onset and severity to that induced with CFA and STZ. Administration of CFA subcutaneously before STZ did not cause hypoglycemia or weight loss but did cause diabetes. Thus, the fasting effect of intraperitoneal CFA was not responsible for the induction of diabetes with CFA and STZ. These data indicate that immunologic adjuvants, endotoxin, and fasting all potentiate the diabetogenic action of low-dose STZ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The basal rates of 45Ca influx in acini and of 45Ca efflux from acini that were preloaded with 45Ca were similar in normal and diabetic rats. The gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8, 0.1 nM) and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (2 microM) increased 45Ca influx to the same extent in both groups of acini. CCK-8 and the divalent cation manganese exerted marked stimulatory effects on 45Ca efflux. In contrast to the rapid effect of CCK-8 on 45Ca efflux, the effect of manganese was slow in onset and was greater in diabetic rat acini. The diabetic state was also associated with a significant decrease in resting [Ca2+]i levels, as determined with the Ca2+ indicator quin 2. Furthermore, the ability of CCK-8 to raise [Ca2+]i levels was significantly attenuated in these cells. Insulin did not alter either basal or CCK-8-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i levels. Our findings suggest that insulin deficiency is associated with multiple alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis in the pancreatic acinar cell. These include a decrease in basal [Ca2+]i levels, perturbations in the signal transduction system that mediates the rapid mobilization of [Ca2+]i after CCK-8-receptor binding, and enhanced sensitivity to the actions of manganese on intracellular Ca2+ pools.\r"

When added together, the following combinations of cytokines showed synergistic cytotoxic effects: TNF (or LT) plus IL-1, TNF (or LT) plus mIFN-gamma, and IL-1 plus mIFN-gamma. These results indicate that the cytokine products of mononuclear cells of the immune system, IFN-gamma, TNF, LT, and IL-1 have strong synergistic cytotoxic effects on islet cells and therefore may act as direct chemical mediators of islet beta-cell destruction in type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Extant data suggest that a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) exists (as a single enzyme or possibly a family of related enzymes) in rodent beta-cells. PKC activators probably induce secretion primarily through phosphorylation of key proteins, thereby sensitizing the exocytotic apparatus to Ca2+. PKC can be activated by several pharmacologic probes and by endogenous diacylglycerol (and possibly arachidonic acid) released by nutrient-activated phospholipases. Several nonspecific pharmacologic agents inhibit both PKC and physiologic insulin release. However, when a more specific inhibitor of PKC, H7 [1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine], was studied, it did not reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion. Moreover, prolonged preexposure of islets to a phorbol ester (believed to induce selective depletion of PKC) also failed to substantially reduce the subsequent secretory response to glucose. Thus, indisputable evidence for an obligatory physiological role of PKC in the islet is still missing, and the enzyme's status as a critical coupling signal should be viewed as putative only.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of a monomeric insulin standard, approximately 28% of total circulating immunoreactive insulin in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a covalent aggregate of insulin. This aggregate probably originates in therapeutic insulin preparations. In this study, the activity of these aggregates was compared with that of monomeric insulin with regard to behavior in the radioimmunoassay, binding to insulin receptors, and biologic activity in isolated rat adipose cells. Molar activity of the aggregate in the insulin radioimmunoassay was approximately twice (240%) that of monomeric insulin, whereas the log-logit slope produced by the aggregate was indistinguishable from that of monomeric insulin. Insulin-receptor binding was determined by displacement of 125I-labeled A14-insulin by insulin or insulin aggregate (10(-10)-10(-5) M). The free-insulin and aggregate concentrations required for half-maximal displacement of 125I-insulin were 4.0 x 10(-10) and 2.25 x 10(-9) M, respectively. [1-14C]glucose incorporation into 14CO2, glyceride-glycerol, and fatty acids was measured over a wide range of insulin monomer and aggregate concentrations (0-8 nM). In the bioassay, the maximal rates of glucose metabolism were equal (normal responsiveness). However, the concentration of insulin aggregates producing half-maximal stimulation of glucose metabolism was threefold greater than that of insulin (140 vs. 46 pM, respectively), indicating decreased sensitivity of the adipose cells to the aggregates. This was associated with a sixfold decrease in the Kd for binding of aggregates to adipose cell insulin receptors compared with binding of monomeric insulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the possibility that EPI inhibits Ca2+ fluxes as its major mechanism by studying 45Ca efflux from prelabeled, intact rat islets. EPI (2.5 x 10(-7) to 1 x 10(-5) M) inhibited insulin release induced by the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (46 mM K+) or the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores (2 mM Ba2+), but it did not reduce the 45Ca efflux stimulated by either agonist. EPI also nullified insulin release induced by isobutylmethylxanthine or dibutyryl cAMP, with minimal or no effects on 45Ca efflux, and blocked the insulinotropic effects of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (a direct activator of protein kinase C), which is believed primarily to sensitize the exocytotic apparatus to Ca2+ without mobilizing additional Ca2+. Previously we reported that similar effects were induced by inhibitors of pancreatic islet lipoxygenase. In this study, however, pretreatment with either the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine or pertussis toxin did not block the effects of lipoxygenase inhibitors, although either agent did block the effects of EPI. Thus, EPI, via an alpha 2-receptor mechanism, is able to reduce exocytosis largely distal to, or independent of, changes in Ca2+ flux, cAMP formation or its Ca2+-mobilizing action, or generation of protein kinase C activators. Therefore, EPI may reduce the sensitivity of the exocytotic apparatus to Ca2+. Inhibition of islet lipoxygenase may have a similar effect; however, in this case, the effect would have to be unrelated, or distal, to stimulation of alpha 2-receptors.\r"

The state of the art describes the wide range of surgical procedures in general surgery, orthopaedics, ear-nose-and-throat, gynaecology and ophthalmology. There are few complications, and very short waiting times in general practice minor surgery. The workload is not great. Economic studies show great saving may be made. Patients strongly prefer general practice minor surgery. In conclusion, despite many advantages, there remain major financial disadvantages for general practitioners in the United Kingdom to provide minor surgery for their patients.\r"

Ileal infusion of a 50% corn oil emulsion or a 20% oleic acid emulsion slowed the rate of gastric emptying compared with ileal infusion of isotonic saline (0.9%). In contrast, infusion of either hypertonic saline (430 mosmol), distilled water, or isotonic solutions containing protein hydrolysate (8 g%) or glucose (50 mM) had no effect on the gastric emptying profile. These experiments support the hypothesis that the presence of unabsorbed lipid or fatty acids in the distal small intestine may delay gastric emptying, but suggest that sugars and proteins are ineffective. As infusion of both protein hydrolysates and lipid into the ileum can delay small bowel transit in humans, the data suggest that ileal regulation of gastric emptying and small bowel transit may be mediated by different mechanisms.\r"

Approximately one-third of patients with gut failure on long-term HPN have low total and free plasma carnitine concentrations, and it has been suggested that a deficiency of L-carnitine may be responsible for the steatosis and steatohepatitis in HPN patients. To determine whether administration of L-carnitine is capable of reversing steatosis in HPN patients, 4 adult women on HPN for a mean of 53 mo (range 21-80 mo) were studied before and after 1 mo of intravenous L-carnitine supplementation (1 g/day). All patients had abnormalities in standard liver function tests and low total and free plasma carnitine values. The mean total and free plasma carnitine concentrations and the mean total hepatic carnitine concentration were reduced before supplementation and rose to normal values after treatment (27.4 +/- 2.3 to 35.5 +/- 3.1 nmol/ml, 19.4 +/- 2.8 to 25.7 +/- 2.5 nmol/ml, and 3.5 +/- 0.65 to 6.5 +/- 1.2 nmol/mg of noncollagen protein, respectively). However, there were no significant changes in mean serum aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels (65 +/- 21 vs. 54 +/- 12 IU and 429 +/- 220 vs. 472 +/- 224 IU, respectively), plasma free fatty acids, plasma triglycerides, hepatic free fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations, or the grade of hepatic steatosis on light microscopy. These results suggest that carnitine deficiency is not a major cause of steatosis and steatohepatitis in patients receiving HPN.\r"

This hypothesis is critically dependent on prior results obtained using glutaraldehyde-polymerized human serum albumin as a model for naturally occurring albumin species. We used the perfused rat liver to characterize the uptake, cellular distribution, and metabolism of glutaraldehyde-polymerized human albumin. 125I-glutaraldehyde-polymerized human albumin was efficiently removed from the perfusate by the liver (29% extraction). However, few autoradiographic grains were located over hepatic parenchymal cells (6%). Instead, most glutaraldehyde-polymerized human albumin appeared to be removed by endothelial (59%) or Kupffer (31%) cells. Hepatic uptake was strongly inhibited by formaldehyde-treated monomeric albumin, a known ligand of the endothelial scavenger receptor for chemically modified proteins. After uptake, most glutaraldehyde-polymerized human albumin was rapidly degraded and released into the perfusate (74% within 60 min). This process was blocked by chloroquine and leupeptin, suggesting that it involves lysosomal acid hydrolases. We conclude that glutaraldehyde-polymerized albumin is efficiently cleared and degraded by the endothelial scavenger pathway. Glutaraldehyde-polymerized albumin therefore appears to be a poor model for predicting the hepatic handling of naturally occurring albumin species bound to hepatitis B virions. Even if viral particles were to follow this pathway, few would enter parenchymal hepatocytes.\r"

Polyamine synthesis is rate limited by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and ODC activity is specifically inhibited by -difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO). To assess the importance of polyamines in adaptive growth we first measured mucosal polyamine profiles at different sites in the normal rat intestine and compared the results with those obtained in adaptive hypoplasia (seven days parental nutrition, TPN), in the adaptive hyperplasia of two weeks after 90% small bowel resection (SBR) or pancreatico biliary diversion (PBD). We then examined the effects of DFMO (2% in drinking water, daily from two days before surgery) on the polyamine concentrations and the adaptive response to PBD. The hyperplasia of SBR and PBD was associated with increases in all the polyamine concentrations particularly putrescine. TPN induced a modest degree of hypoplasia and little change in polyamine synthesis resulting in subnormal polyamine concentrations and significantly inhibited the mucosal adaptive response. Changes in polyamine metabolism are important in intestinal mucosal adaptation and by controlling these changes adaptive growth can be controlled.\r"

In this study we performed the PHD test in 14 coeliac patients before and after three and six months of gluten free diet to show whether the enterocytes maturing processes induced by the diet joined with enhanced PHD values and to assess the clinical usefulness of this test. In all subjects jejunal biopsy carried out after six months showed a partial but consistent histological recovery. The clinical status, xylosuria and daily faecal fat excretion improved progressively and there was a significant increase (p less than 0.001) in mean PHD activity that reached the normal range after three months. After six months a further slight increase of the mean PHD value was recorded. These data indicate that PHD values rise together with the improved intestinal absorptive functions of coeliac patients on gluten free diet and that this test is a useful tool in monitoring recovery of the small bowel mucosa.\r"

Ornithine decarboxylase and DAO were assayed in the proximal and distal small bowel mucosa of 55 rats, starved for four days and then refed. Rats (five per day) were killed after four days' starvation and at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 of refeeding. ODC, whose specific activity was similar in both intestinal segments, almost disappeared after starvation and showed a biphasic response during refeeding. High values were found on day 3 of refeeding in the proximal, and on day 4 in the distal small bowel; thereafter, they decreased gradually to be followed by a further significant increase during the last two days of the experiment. Diamine oxidase specific activity increased after starvation despite a very low total DAO activity in both intestinal segments. Refeeding induced a gradual recovery of DAO total activity. Diamine oxidase specific activity also reverted gradually to control values after five days of refeeding. These data confirm the prominence of ODC in the replication processes and suggest that intestinal DAO may not play a major role in enterocyte replication.\r"

In both models of pancreatic growth, however, the concentration of glutathione-S-transferase was significantly reduced.

  ".W": "Trophic changes of the exocrine pancreas after in vivo gastrin (G)/CCK treatment are well documented but up to now the study of the mechanisms involved is restricted by the lack of a suitable in vitro model. Nevertheless the in vivo trophic effect induced by gastrin/CCK peptides has been associated with an increase of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. In the present work, using the AR42J cell line in which CCK receptors and stimulation of amylase release by CCK peptides has already been demonstrated, we investigated the presence of gastrin binding sites and the possible modulation of proliferation by an inhibitor of ODC activity. 125I-BH-G17ns binding is saturable, reversible and specific. Potencies of the different analogues tested are G17ns greater than CCK8 greater than CCK8ns greater than or equal to G6s greater than G/CCK4. Furthermore dBt cGMP, a non-peptide antagonist for CCK receptors, does not compete for gastrin binding. This indicates the existence of a subclass of gastrin binding sites. Difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO) (1 mM), an irreversible inhibitor of ODC, inhibits cell growth from day 3 up to day 7. This growth inhibition is dose dependent and closely related to an intracellular polyamine modulation. Putrescine and spermidine levels fell under detectable values while spermine levels increased. All these data suggest that this cell line could be a useful in vitro model to study the mechanisms of gastrin induced growth control.\r"

  ".W": "The intestinal mucosa is a rapidly proliferative tissue, with a highly dynamic cell population. Its total cellular mass is well controlled and can adapt, with hypo- or hyperplasia, to a wide variety of stimuli. Luminal nutrients, hormonal factors, and pancreatic and biliary secretions have all been implicated in the regulation of intestinal mucosal adaptation. Similarly, the same factors appear essential for the maintenance of exocrine pancreatic structure and function. The polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) and the key enzyme controlling their synthesis (ornithine decarboxylase, ODC) are important for many cell growth processes, and may play important roles in intestinal and pancreatic adaptation. During intestinal adaptation in response to jejunectomy, lactation and pancreatico-biliary diversion (PBD), intestinal contents of ODC and polyamines are increased, paralleling increases in mucosal proliferative indices and DNA synthesis. With administration of the specific inhibitor of ODC (difluoromethylornithine, DFMO) the increases in ODC and polyamines are suppressed, and intestinal adaptation is abrogated. In pancreatic hyperplasia induced by caerulein, pancreatic polyamines are increased. With DFMO administration, caerulein-induced increases in pancreatic DNA synthesis were inhibited and pancreatic hypertrophy was partially suppressed. PBD-induced pancreatic hypertrophy, however, was not affected by DFMO. Thus, the role of polyamines in the adaptation of the pancreas, with a relatively quiescent proliferative status, is as yet undefined. It seems clear, however, that the induction of ODC and the resultant increase in polyamine biosynthesis are critical for the normal growth and especially for adaptive hyperplasia of the intestinal mucosa.\r"

Blood pressure and renal vascular resistance fell significantly (p less than 0.001), and a slight increase in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow was seen (p less than 0.05). Output of fluid from the proximal tubules, measured as clearance of lithium and uric acid, increased significantly (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively), and a compensatory increase in absolute reabsorption of sodium beyond the proximal tubular level accompanied by an increase in clearance of potassium was noted. A 40% increase in the resultant clearance of sodium (p less than 0.01) and an increase in diuresis (p less than 0.05) followed the morning dose of isradipine after 3.5 months of treatment. Changes in blood pressure were significantly correlated with changes in absolute proximal reabsorption of sodium (r = 0.81), excretion of sodium (r = -0.64), and diuresis (r = -0.80). Thus, the natriuretic properties of calcium entry blockers may be more important for the long-term antihypertensive effect than the vasodilator effect per se. A model for renal sodium handling following treatment with calcium entry blockers was proposed. Although a causal relationship is not implied, isradipine induced a sustained, repetitive postdose effect on proximal fluid output, net natriuresis, and diuresis, that was intimately related to the long-term blood pressure-regulating response.\r"

Responses of blood pressure, heart rate, urinary volume and electrolyte excretion, renin, and aldosterone were measured. For the entire group, ANF lowered blood pressure and increased heart rate during the 0.20 and 0.45 microgram/kg/min infusions, and the antihypertensive effect of the peptide persisted for at least 2 hours after the infusions ended. Four patients (2 at 0.20 microgram/kg/min and 2 at 0.45 microgram/kg/min) experienced sudden bradycardia and hypotension at the end of or shortly after completion of ANF infusion. Renal excretion of water, sodium, chloride, calcium, and phosphorus increased in a dose-dependent fashion in response to infused ANF. Patients on the 200 mEq/day sodium diet had greater increases in urinary volume (11.1 +/- 2.8 vs 3.0 +/- 2.0 ml/min; p less than 0.05), sodium (870 +/- 134 vs 303 +/- 27 microEq/min; p less than 0.05), and chloride (801 +/- 135 vs 176 +/- 75 microEq/min; p less than 0.02) compared with patients on the low sodium diet. The apparent direct suppressive effect of a 0.03 microgram/kg/min infusion of ANF on renin and aldosterone levels was overcome at higher doses by counterregulation provoked by the depressor action. Renin was slightly (-12%) suppressed during the 0.03 microgram/kg/min infusion of ANF but increased at the 0.20 (+50%) and 0.45 microgram/kg/min (+90%; p less than 0.03) rates. Aldosterone declined significantly during the 0.03 microgram/kg/min infusion (-45%; p less than 0.01) of ANF but not during the two higher dose infusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the animals on a high sodium intake, studies were performed before and during graded angiotensin II infusion (10 and 20 ng/kg/min). To separate effects on baroreceptor reflex function mediated by angiotensin II-induced increases in arterial pressure, these studies were repeated on a different day with simultaneous glyceryl trinitrate infusion to prevent increases in pressure during angiotensin II infusion. With the animals on a low sodium intake, studies were performed before and after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril (1 and 5 mg/kg). These studies were also repeated on a separate day during simultaneous phenylephrine infusion to prevent a decrease in pressure with captopril. Reduction in sodium intake had no significant effect on arterial pressure, heart rate, or plasma volume, although arterial plasma angiotensin II concentration and renin activity were significantly increased (p less than 0.01). Infusion of angiotensin II produced a significant reduction in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (p less than 0.01), and converting enzyme inhibition produced a significant increase (p less than 0.05). These effects accompanied significant increases and decreases in arterial angiotensin II concentration, respectively (p less than 0.01), but were independent of angiotensin II-related changes in arterial pressure. The data indicate that physiological variations in circulating angiotensin II have a direct effect on sensitivity of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex.\r"

We found complex responses that were not only composed of a rapid initial nerve-mediated cholinergic contraction and a non-adrenergic nerve-mediated relaxation, but, in 80% of preparations, also of a tonic contraction with a sustained time course. This sustained phase was not blocked by the nervous conductance blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) and was therefore not neurally mediated. Controlled transient cooling to 4 degrees C in the organ bath reduced this sustained phase selectively for several hours. The leukotriene (LT) antagonist FPL 55712, dexamethasone, which inhibits phospholipase A2, and the antiasthmatic drug cromolyn all reduced the sustained phase significantly. In 20% of strips, an additional TTX-resistant contraction was seen directly after the cholinergic phase. This contraction could be inhibited by indomethacin. A similar small peak sometimes appeared after selective blocking of either the cholinergic or the sustained phases. Experiments in which the epithelium was removed from the strips suggested that this indomethacin-sensitive response, but not the sustained phase, was dependent on the presence of epithelium. These results show that EFS of fresh human bronchi stimulated cholinergic and nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves and gave rise to a partly epithelium-dependent synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites, which caused contractile responses that interfered with the neurally mediated responses.\r"

Mean values of ventilation were 945, 683, and 1,037 ml/min during normoxemia, hypoxemia, and recovery from hypoxemia, respectively. Ventilatory depression occurred in each cat during hypoxemia. Mean values of medullary ECF PCO2 were 57.7 +/- 7.2 (SD), 59.4 +/- 9.7, and 57.4 +/- 7.2 Torr during normoxemia, hypoxemia, and recovery to normoxemia, respectively; respective values for ECF [H+] were 60.9 +/- 8.0, 64.4 +/- 11.6, and 62.9 +/- 9.2 neq/l.

Percent BPAP metabolism (%M) ranged from 92 +/- 3 (respiratory alkalosis) to 85 +/- 3 (normal), 82 +/- 3 (respiratory acidosis), and 78 +/- 2% (severe respiratory acidosis).

In an investigation of wholebody glucose metabolism in healthy adult humans, using a continuous intravenous infusion of D-[U-13C]glucose, we found that a precise estimate of the rate of glucose oxidation was difficult to achieve when the study included infusions with unlabeled glucose. Problems arose 1) as a result of the slow rate at which the 13CO2 released by glucose oxidation reaches an equilibrium in expired air CO2 and 2) due to the contribution to 13CO2 output by the natural 13C in the unlabeled glucose that was infused. In a subsequent series of experiments in healthy young adults, we found that the entry of 13CO2 released by the tissues into the bicarbonate pool and into the expired air is relatively slow and a tracer infusion protocol of approximately 6 h is required for determination of glucose oxidation. This applies when metabolic states are changed acutely during the experiment or when unlabeled glucose is infused. However, for resting subjects in the basal postabsorptive state we confirmed that the time required to achieve a steady state in the 13C enrichment of expired air can be shortened significantly by the use of a NaH13CO3 priming dose, even when this dose varies from the ideal.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hypercapnia on the suppression of efferent hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal nerve activity by phasic volume feedback was studied in decerebrate paralyzed intubated cats ventilated with a phrenic-driven servo-respirator. The gain of the respirator was altered for single inspirations, and the resulting changes in neural activities were quantified by comparison with respective neural activities without phasic volume feedback. This maneuver was performed when the end-tidal CO2 concentration was 5, 7, and 9%. Changes in the level of CO2 did not alter the slope or position of the volume thresholds for suppression of hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal activities. The slope of the volume-time isopleths for specific levels of graded suppression also remained constant for each nerve at the different levels of CO2. Under hypercapnic conditions, greater volumes were required at a given time into inspiration to achieve any particular level of suppression, but these differences generally did not reach statistical significance. These data demonstrate a lack of effect of the CO2 stimulus on the suppression of upper airway motoneuron activity by phasic volume feedback. Despite the absence of this interaction, a CO2-induced increase in central inspiratory activation of upper airway motoneurons, in the presence of a very sensitive volume feedback system, would help maintain airway patency in the face of upper airway narrowing or closure.\r"

  ".W": "The study evaluated the interrelationships between the extent of thoracic movements and respiratory chemical drive in shaping the intensity of the sensation of dyspnea. Normal subjects rated their sensations of dyspnea as PCO2 increased during free rebreathing and during rebreathing while ventilation was voluntarily maintained at a constant base-line level. Another trial evaluated the effects on the intensity of dyspnea, of voluntary reduction in the level of ventilation while PCO2 was held constant. During rebreathing, there was a power function relationship between changes in PCO2 and the intensity of dyspnea. At a given PCO2, constraining tidal volume and breathing frequency to the prerebreathing base-line level resulted in an increase in dyspnea. The fractional differences in the intensity of dyspnea between free and constrained rebreathing were independent of PCO2. However, the absolute difference in the intensity of dyspnea between free and constrained rebreathing enlarged with increasing hypercapnia. At PCO2 of 50 Torr, this difference correlated significantly with the increase in both minute ventilation (r = 0.675) and tidal volume (r = 0.757) above the base line during free rebreathing. Similarly, during steady-state hypercapnia at 50 Torr PCO2, the intensity of dyspnea increased progressively as ventilation was voluntarily reduced from the spontaneously adopted free-breathing level. These results indicate that dyspnea increases with the level of respiratory chemical drive but that the intensity of the sensation is further accentuated when ventilation is constrained below that demanded by the level of chemical drive. This may be explained by a loss of inhibitory feedback from lung or chest wall mechanoreceptors acting on brain stem and/or cortical centers.\r"

Driving pressure (DP) was calculated by means of a respiratory neuromechanical model (J. Appl. Physiol. 51: 963-989, 1981) that permitted the derivation, from tidal volume and flow, of the occlusion pressure equivalent (at functional residual capacity) of respiratory neural output throughout the breath. ERL caused a prolongation of both neural inspiratory duration (12.2 +/- 6.9% SD) and expiratory duration (25.0 +/- 10.1%) and an increase in the amplitude of DP (16.5 +/- 10.2%) without any changes in the waveshape of IA and in end-expiratory level. The relative time course of PIA was not altered by ERL. Minute ventilation was depressed (-6.75 +/- 2.88%) during ERL with little change in alveolar PCO2. The results indicate that pulmonary gas exchange may be improved during ERL through increased tidal volume as well as delayed expiratory lung emptying secondary to sustained PIA.\r"

The animals also underwent experiments with 4 h of spontaneous breathing (SB) and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) with and without addition of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for comparison. After IPPV and SB there was no change in the clearance rate of either 99mTcO4- or 99mTc-DTPA. After IPPV + PEEP and HPOV (8 and 16 Hz), there was an increase in the clearance rate of 99mTc-DTPA, but an increase in clearance rate of 99mTcO4- was seen after IPPV + PEEP only. In a separate group of dogs an increase in end-tidal lung volume was demonstrated after 4 h of ventilation with IPPV + PEEP (but not after HFOV), and this may account for the measured increase in 99mTcO4- clearance. We conclude that an increase in 99mTc-DTPA clearance rate after HFOV signifies an increase in pulmonary epithelial permeability, possibly through the mechanism of damage to the intercellular junctions during HFOV.\r"

  ".W": "Drugs possessing membrane stabilizing activity might act to diminish the augmented microvascular permeability resulting from acute lung injury. To test this rats were pretreated with quinidine, procainamide, or lidocaine and then given the lung injury-inducing agent thiourea. Vascular permeability, assessed as the extravascular accumulation of radiolabeled protein, was increased more than threefold by thiourea. This increase was diminished by 29, 34, and 43% after pretreatment with procainamide, quinidine, and lidocaine, respectively. Lidocaine also returned the thiourea-induced increase in lung wet weight-to-dry weight ratios to control levels. This protection was not likely due to hemodynamic effects of these agents, since no differences were noted in cardiac output between pretreated rats and those receiving thiourea alone and a small increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure in the lidocaine-pretreatment group was the only difference noted. O2 metabolites have been implicated in the pathogenesis of thiourea-induced lung injury. None of these agents scavenged O2- or H2O2 directly, but quinidine and procainamide diminished in vitro neutrophil O2- and H2O2 production, and lidocaine inhibited neutrophil H2O2 production. However, neutropenia (PMN less than 100/ml) induced with either vinblastine or cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) failed to prevent thiourea-induced increases in pulmonary vascular protein leak. In conclusion, procainamide, quinidine, and lidocaine diminished lung injury in rats after thiourea. Although these agents diminish PMN O2 metabolite production in vitro their salutary role in thiourea-induced lung injury appears to be through an unknown mechanism that is independent of their effects on neutrophil O2 metabolite-dependent toxicity.\r"

The carotid bodies (CB's) have been proposed as modulators of these kinetics. The present investigation was undertaken to determine whether the effect is specific to CB activation or whether other factors that augment the exercise hyperpnea would produce a similar response. We therefore established the effects of increased CB and central (C) chemoreflex activation on the inspired ventilatory (VI) dynamics for moderate-intensity cycling. Work tests were separately performed with air, 12% O2 to increase CB activity, 100% O2 to \"abolish\" CB activity, and CO2 in O2 to increase C activity. The time constant of the VI response was substantially shortened by hypoxia (40 s) compared with air breathing (58 s) and increased by 100% O2 (92 s) and, even more so, by CO2 in O2 (101 s). We conclude that increased carotid (but not central) chemoreflex responsiveness speeds the kinetics of the exercise hyperpnea by a process that is not merely the consequence of increased ventilatory drive.\r"

To avoid a possible reaction between an oligomycin-ethanol mixture and blood, we administered oligomycin to the carotid body via cell- and protein-free perfusate. Except for the perfusion periods, the carotid body received its own natural blood supply. Responses to O2, CO2, sodium cyanide, and nicotine of the same carotid chemoreceptor afferents were studied before and after each perfusion. An appropriate low dose of oligomycin completely blocked carotid chemoreceptor response to O2 while preserving the CO2 response. At the same time cyanide response was attenuated leaving nicotine response intact. Additional doses of oligomycin attenuated carotid chemoreceptor response to CO2 as well. Perfusion with a blank solution containing ethanol did not change the carotid body chemoreceptor responses. These effects of oligomycin on carotid chemoreceptor responses to O2 and CO2 were reversible, and restoration of the response to CO2 preceded that to O2. In addition, oligomycin administered into the blood with close intra-arterial injection produced similar differential blockade of O2 and CO2 chemoreception, preserving the nicotine and dopamine effects. This study confirmed the previous findings and provided new evidence showing that 1) the responses of carotid chemoreceptor to O2 and CO2 were separable by oligomycin due to the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and 2) the responses to nicotine and dopamine were intact even after blockade of O2 response.\r"

The patients were followed after discontinuation of therapy for up to 60 months. Serum T4, free T4 (FT4) and T3 levels, TSH receptor antibody (TRab) and anti-DNA antibody titers, and the percentage of HLA-DR positive lymphocytes in peripheral blood were measured serially. TRab and anti-DNA antibody tests were positive in the majority of patients before treatment and were negative in most at the end of treatment. Twenty-three (12.5%) patients had a recurrence of their hyperthyroidism, which occurred a mean of 20 months after withdrawal of methimazole; they are designated as having overt recurrent hyperthyroidism (group A). In these patients, serum T4, FT4 and T3 concentrations increased rather abruptly to markedly elevated levels in a several-month period and the TRab and anti-DNA antibody titers increased markedly at or shortly after recurrence in the majority. In 9 patients (4.1%), TRH-induced TSH secretion became totally suppressed, indicating the reappearance of thyroidal autonomy; however, the patients did not have any hyperthyroid signs and symptoms (subclinical hyperthyroidism; group B). Their serum T4 and FT4 concentrations fluctuated in the upper normal to slightly supra-normal range, and their serum T3 concentrations remained within the normal range throughout the follow-up period, but their TRab and anti-DNA antibody titers did not appreciably increase. Thus, the time of recurrence could not be precisely determined in group B. In the remainder (152 patients; 83.4%), serum thyroid hormone levels and TRH-induced TSH secretion remained normal, TRab and anti-DNA antibody titers remained negative, and hyperthyroidism did not recur (euthyroid remission; group C). At the time of final examination (in groups B and C) or at the time of recurrence (in group A), the percentage of HLA-DR positive peripheral lymphocytes was 17.9% in group A, 15.9% in group B, and 12.1% in group C. Retrospective analysis of the data indicated that the mean pretreatment TRab titer (percent inhibition of TSH binding) was slightly but not significantly lower in group C (37.8%) compared to those in group A (53.9%) and group B (54.8%). The 3 groups were indistinguishable by all other laboratory data both before treatment and at the time of the T3 suppression test. These data strongly indicate heterogeneity among patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether obesity was a marker for a neuroendocrinologically distinct form of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO). Further, since women with PCO have significantly higher basal and/or glucose-stimulated plasma insulin levels, we also examined the effects of chronic hyperinsulinemia on gonadotropin and gonadal steroid secretion. Ten obese women (nine with acanthosis nigricans) and five nonobese women (one with acanthosis nigricans) with PCO as well as seven obese and six nonobese women of comparable age and weight in the midfollicular phase of their cycles were studied. Pulsatile gonadotropin release was determined for 6-24 h as well as gonadotroph sensitivity to GnRH (10 micrograms, iv). The obese PCO women had significantly increased basal and glucose-stimulated plasma insulin levels compared to the other groups, the nonobese PCO and the obese normal women had similar insulin levels, and the nonobese normal women had the lowest insulin levels. All four groups had similar plasma estradiol levels. Both the obese and the nonobese PCO women had similar and significantly higher mean plasma LH levels, LH pulse amplitude, and integrated LH responses to GnRH compared to values in both normal groups (P less than 0.01 to P less than 0.001); the obese PCO women did not differ from the nonobese PCO women. The mean LH pulse frequencies per 6 h were similar in the four groups. FSH secretion did not differ significantly in the four groups. The levels of the putative gonadal feedback steroids, plasma total and non-sex hormone-binding globulin-bound testosterone, non-sex hormone-binding globulin-bound estradiol, and estrone, were similar in both PCO groups and were significantly higher than those in both normal groups (all P less than 0.001). The only independent effect of obesity was on plasma androstenedione levels and the androstenedione to estrone ratio, both of which were significantly higher in PCO women than normal women (P less than 0.01 to P less than 0.001), but significantly lower in the obese (PCO and normal) women than in nonobese (PCO and normal) women (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that 1) the impact, if any, of obesity in PCO is not reflected in discernible changes in gonadotropin release or in the gonadal steroid feedback environment; and 2) insulin does not have a major role in the perpetuation of PCO, since obese and nonobese PCO women had similar reproductive hormone levels despite significantly different degrees of hyperinsulinemia.\r"

  ".W": "We studied pituitary-gonadal function during the first year of life in 48 boys born with 56 undescended testes in order to test the hypotheses that functional insufficiency of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis and disorders of testosterone (T) biosynthesis occur in such boys. Cryptorchidism persisted for longer than 1 yr in 29 boys (30 testes; group I), whereas spontaneous descent occurred in 19 boys (20 testes; group II), in 6 after the sixth month. A control group (group III) included 160 boys. Basal and peak LHRH-stimulated serum LH and FSH and basal serum T values were determined at 3, 6, and 12 months. Serum T, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), progesterone (P), 17-hydroxypregnenolone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione before and after hCG administration were determined at age 1 yr. Comparing the 3 groups, cross-sectional evaluation revealed no significant differences in basal or peak LHRH-stimulated serum LH and FSH levels, except that basal serum LH levels were slightly higher in group II than in group III. Comparing groups I and II, longitudinal evaluation revealed similar basal and peak LHRH-stimulated serum LH and FSH values, with comparable changes with time. Basal serum T, DHT, and T precursor levels were similar in all three groups, with similar rises of T and DHT and variable minimal increases in androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate after hCG stimulation. We conclude that during the first year of life, boys with cryptorchidism have no functional insufficiency of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis or disorders in T biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Current treatment of acromegaly (surgery, radiation, and bromocriptine) is often unsatisfactory, and a sizeable proportion of patients with this disease continue to have GH hypersecretion after all therapeutic modalities have been exhausted. Fifteen patients with active acromegaly (8 previously treated and 7 newly diagnosed) were treated with the long-acting somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 (Sandoz; 50-250 micrograms, sc, every 6-8 h for up to 21 months). The mean daily plasma GH concentration was significantly suppressed in 13 patients, and it became normal in 10. Two patients, however, did not have GH suppression by SMS 201-995 treatment alone; in 1, a significant decline in mean daily GH was achieved after the addition of bromocriptine. As expected, suppression of GH secretion was associated with normalization of plasma somatomedin-C values and significant clinical improvement. Plasma GH responses to synthetic GHRH-(1-44) and TRH were either abolished or blunted by SMS 201-995. Thyroid function remained normal, and glucose tolerance did not change. Significant shrinkage of pituitary tumors occurred in 7 previously untreated and 2 previously treated patients. Side-effects were minimal. SMS 201-995 is an effective agent for the treatment of acromegaly. Further studies are necessary to establish guidelines for identification of non-responders and to examine the effect of preoperative tumor shrinkage on subsequent surgical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "To examine gonadotropin secretory frequency as a component of the disordered neuroendocrine regulation of gonadotropin secretion in women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), we measured serum gonadotropin concentrations in 12 women with PCOD at 10-min intervals for periods of 12-24 h. The patterns of LH and FSH release in these patients were compared to the findings of 24 studies in 21 age-matched normal women during the early, mid- and late follicular phases (EFP, MFP and LFP) of their cycles. Serum sex steroid levels during the 12-24 h of study in the women with PCOD were compared to those in normal women studied during the follicular phase. The mean serum estradiol (E2) level in the women with PCOD was similar to that in normal women studied in the EFP, but lower than those in normal women in the MFP (P less than 0.05) and LFP (P less than 0.01). Mean serum estrone, however, was significantly higher in women with PCOD than in women in the EFP and MFP (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.02, respectively), but lower than that in women in the LFP (P less than 0.02). Total and unbound testosterone (T) levels were significantly elevated in women with PCOD compared to those in normal women at all stages of the follicular phase (P less than 0.001). The mean serum LH concentration and LH pulse amplitude were markedly elevated in the women with PCOD compared to normal women at all three stages of the follicular phase (P less than 0.05 or less). In addition, LH pulse frequency was faster in women with PCOD [24.8 +/- 0.9 ( +/- SE) pulses/24 h] than that in women in the EFP (15.6 +/- 0.7; P less than 0.01), MFP (22.2 +/- 1.1; P less than 0.05) and LFP (20.8 +/- 1.2; P less than 0.01). This increased LH pulse frequency in women with PCOD correlated with ambient serum E2 levels on the day of study (r = 0.84; P less than 0.001), but not with serum estrone, T, or unbound T. Repeat studies in four women with PCOD demonstrated a similarly abnormal gonadotropin secretory pattern in each. We conclude that 1) women with PCOD have an increase in both the amplitude and frequency of LH secretion compared to those in normally cycling women throughout the follicular phase; 2) the defect in women with PCOD is reproducible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "High serum of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] concentrations and target organ resistance to the hormone are characteristic findings in some New World primates (platyrrhines). We examined the abilities of cultural dermal fibroblasts from individual platyrrhines of four different genera, Aotus, Alouatta, Pithecia, and Saguinus, to internalize and respond to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in an attempt to identify possible phenotypic heterogeneity in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-receptor interaction among them. Results were compared to those from two Old World primates (catarrhines), Pan troglodytes and Pongo pygmaeus. Compared to catarrhine cells, cells from Alouatta, Pithecia, and Saguinus demonstrated 1) a 10-fold decrease in [3H] 1,25-(OH)2D3 internalization capacity; 2) a 2- to 5-fold increase in the apparent internalization constant [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3; and 3) a 3- to 15-fold increase in the 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration required to elicit half-maximal induction of [3H]25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylating activity (ED50; rank order Sanguinus much greater than Pithecia greater than Alouatta). Although the internalization capacity of cells from two different primates in the genus Aotus was 3- to 4-fold lower than that in catarrhine cells, the internalization constant for hormone and ED50 for 24-hydroxylating activity were similar. These data suggest that the functional 1,25-(OH)2D3-receptor phenotype of the owl monkey, Aotus trivirgatus, is more closely aligned to the catarrhine phenotype than are those of other platyrrhines in the families Cebidae and Callitricidae.\r"

Serum thyroid hormone levels were significantly lower in the dialysis patients than in the normal subjects (P less than 0.001) and were in the hypothyroid range in a high proportion of dialysis patients (total T3, 25%; free T3, 45%; total T4, 55%; free T4, 45%; and free T4 index, 38%). The reduced free thyroid hormone levels could not be explained by currently recognized assay artefacts. Serum TSH levels were higher than in the normal subjects (P less than 0.01), but still within the normal range for most (35 of 40) dialysis patients and did not correlate significantly with total or free thyroid hormone concentrations in either group. These results suggest some impairment in the thyroidal response to TSH and impaired pituitary response to low serum thyroid hormone levels, the latter implying resetting of the normal feedback mechanism such that diminished thyroid hormone production evokes a smaller than normal increase in TSH secretion. This diminished thyrotroph sensitivity to reduced serum thyroid hormone levels may be beneficial in severe nonthyroidal illness.\r"

However, two women who were found to have gonadotroph adenomas several years after ovarian ablation have been reported. We describe a middle-aged man who developed bitemporal hemianopia and was found to have a large pituitary tumor 35 yr after castration. He had never received any replacement therapy. The tumor was considered to be a primary gonadotroph adenoma, rather than secondary gonadotroph hyperplasia, on the basis of its secretory capabilities, its reticulin patterns, and its specific immunostaining for human FSH beta, human LH beta, and alpha-subunit. Furthermore, the tumor did not decrease appreciably in size after 12 months of testosterone treatment, although plasma gonadotropin levels decreased. Unless the association of primary gonadal failure with a gonadotroph adenoma was coincidental, it suggests that some human gonadotroph adenomas may be secondary to failure of the gonads.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the ability of SRIH and SRIH analog, SMS 201-995 (SMS), to inhibit stimulated GH and TSH secretion in men who received 120-min iv infusions of saline, SRIH (5, 50, and 500 micrograms/h), and SMS (3, 30, and 300 ng/kg.h) together with a bolus iv injection of GHRH (1 microgram/kg) and TRH (500 micrograms). Integrated GH secretion during the 60 min after GHRH plus TRH injection was decreased compared to that after saline by (mean +/- SE) 32 +/- 14% (P = 0.059), 78 +/- 5% (P less than 0.001), and 88 +/- 3% (P less than 0.001) during the 5, 50, and 500 micrograms/h SRIH infusions, and by 13 +/- 7% (P = NS), 50 +/- 15% (P less than 0.05), and 80 +/- 6% (P less than 0.001) during the 3, 30, and 300 ng/kg.h SMS infusions. In contrast, integrated TSH secretion was unaltered during the 5 micrograms/h SRIH and 3 ng/kg.h SMS infusions; it decreased by only 43 +/- 5% (P less than 0.001) and 66 +/- 4% (P less than 0.001) during the 50 and 500 micrograms/h SRIH infusions and by 33 +/- 8% (P less than 0.05) and 50 +/- 3% (P less than 0.001) during the 30 and 300 ng/kg.h SMS infusions. Analysis of the dose-response curves indicated approximately 10- and 5-fold greater potencies of SRIH and SMS, respectively, in inhibiting GH as compared to TSH secretion. These results quantify the effect of SRIH as an inhibitor of GH secretion and suggest that if SRIH has a physiological role in the inhibition of TSH secretion in man, it is limited to conditions associated with marked suppression of GH.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate Leydig cell function in men with idiopathic oligospermic infertility and its eventual role in their infertility, plasma LH, testosterone (T), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (170HP), and estradiol levels as well as plasma T/LH and 170HP/T ratios were measured in 103 such men, subdivided into different groups according to their plasma FSH levels. The results were compared to results in normal young fertile men, the subgroup of men with idiopathic oligospermic infertility who within 12 months after consultation succeeded in impregnating their partner, infertile men with a history of undescended testes (excryptorchid men), and men with Klinefelter's syndrome. As a tentative parameter of androgen insensitivity, an androgen insensitivity index [LH (IU/L) X T (nMol/L)] was calculated. Although all men with idiopathic infertility had plasma T and LH levels within the normal range, LH levels increased and T/LH ratios decreased with increasing FSH levels, while the 170HP/T and estradiol/T ratios were independent of the FSH levels and T/LH ratios. The decreased T/LH ratios in the presence of normal T levels suggest compensated Leydig cell insufficiency, which possibly contributes to the infertility. Indeed, none of the men (n = 12) with normal FSH levels but a T/LH ratio lower than 1.50 achieved fatherhood within 12 months of follow-up, although all other hormonal parameters were within the normal range. During the same period 25 men with T/LH ratios greater than 1.50 succeeded in impregnating their partners (P less than 0.05). In infertile excryptorchid men and even more so in men with Klinefelter's syndrome, plasma T levels and T/LH ratios were significantly decreased, the decrease being greater than in patients with idiopathic azospermia with similar FSH levels. None of the excryptorchid men with normal FSH levels but T/LH ratios below 1.50 fathered a child during the follow-up study. We suggest that the T/LH ratio is an additional useful prognostic parameter of infertility. Plasma T levels were increased in 15% of patients with idiopathic infertility, but increased plasma LH together with increased T levels (increased androgen resistance index) were found in only 1 man. An increased index, however, was found in 6 azoospermic excryptorchid men and 4 of 28 men with Klinefelter's syndrome. Taken together these data suggest that this index is not a reliable parameter of androgen resistance.\r"

Men with malignant and, to a lesser extent, benign lung disease had decreased serum total T and free T index values at the 5th percentiles, with elevations of LH and FSH levels at the 95th percentiles. Linear regression analysis showed reductions in total T and free T index and increases in FSH, but not LH, levels with age in each group. Using multivariate analysis, we found stronger independent effects of disease than age on serum total T and fraction of T bound, but a greater influence of age on free T index. Serum LH values differed by diagnosis, whereas FSH differed by age. Relative to values in the normal men, mean serum total T levels were reduced in men with lung cancer; the fraction of T bound was decreased in the men with lung cancer and increased in the men with benign lung disease, the free T index was decreased in the men with both malignant and benign lung disease, and LH was increased in the men with lung cancer. The hormone and hormone binding results were similar in men with different types of lung cancer. Biochemical evidence of primary and secondary (or combined primary and secondary) hypogonadism was present in 50-59% and 28-32%, respectively, of the men with malignant and benign lung disease vs. 10% of the normal men. These data suggest that 1) there is an increased prevalence of both pituitary gonadotropic and testicular dysfunction in men with malignant and, to a lesser extent, benign chronic lung disease, and 2) the effects of illness are independent of, and quantitatively greater than, those due to age.\r"

We investigated the dopaminergic regulation of alpha-subunit secretion in four patients with alpha-subunit secreting pituitary adenomas documented by serum and immunocytochemical studies. In three of the four patients there was a significant decrease in serum alpha-subunit concentrations during 6 weeks of bromocriptine administration. Tumor size decreased in two patients. In pituitary tumor cells from one patient cultured in vitro, dopamine caused a highly significant decrease in media alpha-subunit concentrations. To investigate whether dopaminergic regulation of alpha-subunit secretion occurs at a pre- or posttranslational level, messenger RNA (mRNA) from cultured tumor cells from one patient was analyzed by Northern blot techniques. A decrease in alpha-subunit mRNA occurred in cells incubated with 10(-10), 10(-8), and 10(-6) M dopamine. We conclude that dopamine suppressed pituitary tumor alpha-subunit secretion and mRNA levels. Dopamine agonists may be of benefit in the therapy of patients with such tumors.\r"

To assess the role of Na+-H+ exchange in net tNH3 secretion, rates of net tNH3 secretion and tNH3 production were measured in proximal tubule segments perfused with control pH 7.4 Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer or with modified KRB buffers containing 10 mM sodium and 0.1 mM amiloride. Net tNH3 secretion was inhibited by 90% in proximal tubule segments perfused with the pH 7.4 modified KRB buffer while tNH3 production remained unaffected. The inhibition of net tNH3 secretion by perfusion with the modified KRB buffer was only partially reversed by acidifying the modified KRB luminal perfusate from 7.4 to as low as 6.2. These data indicate that the Na+-H+ exchanger facilitates a major portion of net tNH3 secretion by the proximal tubule and that luminal acidification may play only a partial role in the mechanism by which the Na+-H+ exchanger mediates net tNH3 secretion.\r"

  ".W": "A novel IL-2 receptor, distinct from the Tac protein, has been identified on the surface of purified human natural killer (NK) cells by chemical cross-linking of 125I-IL-2. This protein is approximately 70,000 D in size (p70) and appears to be identical to the recently recognized second subunit of the human high affinity IL-2 receptor complex. Scatchard analysis of 125I-IL-2 binding to purified NK cells revealed approximately 2,300 p70 binding sites per cell with an apparent dissociation constant of 200 pM, a value intermediate between the previously recognized high and low affinity forms of the human IL-2 receptor. The monoclonal anti-Tac antibody did not inhibit the cross-linking of 125I-IL-2 to the p70 binding sites present on NK cells. Functionally, the addition of high concentrations of recombinant IL-2 to the enriched NK cells promoted a rapid augmentation of cytolytic activity and a more delayed increase in cellular proliferation. Anti-Tac effectively blocked the IL-2-induced proliferative response in these cells, but failed to alter the enhancement of cytotoxicity. Analysis of NK cytoplasmic RNA isolated at various time points after IL-2 stimulation revealed the rapid induction of c-myb and Tac gene expression that was also not inhibited by the anti-Tac antibody. These findings suggest that IL-2 binding to the p70 receptor constitutively expressed on the surface of NK cells may mediate both the development of increased cytolytic activity and rapid changes in gene expression. The activation of the Tac gene may in turn permit the formation of the high affinity IL-2 receptor complex (comprised of at least the Tac and p70 proteins) that appears to transduce the requisite signals involved in NK cell proliferation.\r"

  ".U": "88087897\r", 
  ".W": "Accelerated coronary atherosclerosis is a major cause of graft failure after heart transplantation. Graft atherosclerosis is typically diffuse and difficult to detect even with coronary arteriography. Recently, acetylcholine was shown to dilate blood vessels by releasing a vasorelaxant substance from the endothelium (endothelium-derived relaxing factor). We have demonstrated paradoxical vasoconstriction induced by acetylcholine both early and late in the course of coronary atherosclerosis in patients, suggesting an association of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that coronary arteries of heart transplant patients can show endothelial dysfunction before or in the early stages of angiographically evident coronary atherosclerosis. Acetylcholine was infused into the left anterior descending artery of 13 heart transplant patients at 12 (n = 9) and 24 (n = 4) mo after transplantation. Vascular responses were evaluated by quantitative angiography. Among patients with angiographically smooth coronary arteries, relatively few (6/25) arterial segments had preserved vasodilator responses, while the majority failed to dilate (10/25) or paradoxically constricted (9/25). Angiographically irregular coronary arteries were present in three patients, in whom 8/10 segments showed marked paradoxical constriction and the remaining 2/10 failed to dilate. Only 1 of 13 patients retained appropriate dilation to acetylcholine in all segments. Nitroglycerin, which acts directly on vascular smooth muscle, dilated nearly all segments. No clinical features of the patients, including myocardial rejection appeared to correlate with the impaired functional response of vessels. Thus impaired response to acetylcholine is a common early finding in heart transplant patients and emphasizes the potential importance of endothelial dysfunction in the development of atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Human T cell leukemia/lymphoma (T-lymphotropic) virus type I (HTLV-I) infection has been considered to be closely associated with the leukemogenesis of adult T cell leukemia (ATL), in which interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors are abnormally expressed. In this study, however, Southern blot analysis revealed no gross rearrangement or obvious amplification of the IL-2 receptor gene in ATL leukemic cells, indicating that abnormal IL-2 receptor expression in ATL is not due to the structural change of its gene. Hence, we studied the expression of the IL-2 receptor and HTLV-I at the RNA level during short-term cultures of leukemic cells from 9 ATL patients. Cytoplasmic dot hybridization and Northern hybridization revealed that fresh leukemic cells from seven of nine patients expressed a small amount of IL-2 receptor mRNA but HTLV-I RNA was undetectable in all cases. After cultures for up to 7 d, both IL-2 receptor mRNA and HTLV-I RNA (including pX message) expression concomitantly increased, whereas the amounts of other cellular genes, except for beta-actin, did not. The increases in their RNA expression were inhibited by early addition (within 12 h after the beginning of the culture) of cycloheximide, indicating that these increases are mediated by newly synthesized protein(s). These results strongly suggested that IL-2 receptor expression is closely associated with HTLV-I expression in leukemic cells from ATL patients.\r"

In primitive organisms ANF is present within both atria and ventricle, suggesting that the ventricle may participate both in the synthesis and release of the hormone. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that ventricular ANF develops as a homeostatic response to intravascular volume overload. Studies were performed on cardiac tissue obtained from (i) normal and cardiomyopathic hamsters, (ii) autopsied humans with and without cardiac disease, and (iii) living humans with congestive heart failure (CHF) undergoing diagnostic right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. The myocardium was examined for the presence of immunoreactive ANF using a two-stage immunohistochemical technique, with nonimmune rabbit sera used as a negative control. There was unequivocal evidence of focal subendocardial deposits of immunoreactive ANF present in both of the ventricles of all six cardiomyopathic hamsters, four of five autopsied human subjects with CHF, and five of seven biopsied humans. No immunoreactive ANF was observed within the ventricular myocardium of control hamsters or normal humans. Utilizing crude tissue homogenates and radioimmunoassay techniques, the quantity of ANF was determined in cardiac atria, ventricles, and noncardiac skeletal muscle. Heart failure is characterized by a reduction in atrial ANF and an increase in ventricular ANF. This study demonstrates immunoreactive ANF is present within the ventricular myocardium in cardiomyopathic hamsters and humans with CHF, and suggests that the ventricle may be capable of responding to chronic volume overload by producing ANF.\r"

  ".W": "The enzymatic and immunologic properties of the defective residual alpha-L-iduronidase activities were investigated in fibroblast extracts from the three subtypes of mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Hurler (MPS IH), Scheie (MPS IS), and Hurler-Scheie (MPS IH-S) diseases. Using 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-L-iduronide (4MU-alpha-Id), the activities in fibroblast extracts from all three subtypes were less than 0.1% of normal. Rocket immunoelectrophoresis with monospecific rabbit anti-human alpha-L-iduronidase polyclonal antibodies, as well as immunoblots using a monoclonal antibody, revealed the presence of cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) in extracts prepared from each subtype. When the samples were equalized for beta-hexosaminidase A activity, 38-105% of normal enzyme protein was detected. The sequential addition of cystamine, MgCl2 and pyridoxal phosphate increased the residual 4MU-alpha-Id activities in subtype extracts up to about 35% of normal mean fibroblast activity. Cystamine, MgCl2 or pyridoxal phosphate alone enhanced the residual activities two- to fourfold, whereas the sequential addition of all three compounds was required for maximal effect. Of the six B6 vitamers evaluated, only the negatively charged forms, pyridoxamine (PLN), pyridoxamine phosphate (PNP), and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), stimulated the residual activities. The addition of dermatan sulfate or heparan sulfate to the subtype extracts, followed by treatment with the effector compounds, similarly inhibited both the normal and enhanced MPS I activities. Heat inactivation experiments confirmed the fact that the mutant iduronidase activity was reconstituted and that the observed increase in enzymatic activity was not an artifact of the fluorogenic assay. These results suggest that the presence of certain thiol reducing agents, divalent cations and negatively charged B6 vitamers can alter the conformation of the mutant alpha-L-iduronidase in vitro such that the hydrolysis of 4MU-alpha-Id is enhanced into the heterozygote range.\r"

The biopsy specimens were examined by light microscopy and immunofluorescence for hepatitis B virus surface and core antigens (HBsAg and HBcAg), and the iron content was determined chemically. The results were compared with serum ferritin concentration and aspartate transaminase (AST) activity and with hepatitis B virus serology. Biopsy specimens, in which chemical liver iron had been determined in 12, were also available from 17 patients. Mean serum ferritin (+/- SD) had fallen from 5885 (3245) micrograms/l to 1638 (976) micrograms/l in 36 patients after eight years' chelation, while mean (+/- SD) liver iron concentration had fallen from 2945 (900) micrograms/100 mg dry weight to 857 (435) micrograms/100 mg dry weight in 12 of them. All biopsy specimens examined were negative for HBs and HBc antigens. The presence of histological features of hepatitis was associated with increased liver iron content, increased fibrosis, and with progression of fibrosis between the two biopsies. Procollagen III peptide was assayed in 28 patients but did not correlate with the degree of hepatitis, fibrosis, or with chemical liver iron content. We conclude that with regular subcutaneous DFX, mean concentrations of serum ferritin and liver iron are maintained in these patients at about five and 10 times the normal value, respectively, and that progression of liver damage is more likely to be due to viral hepatitis, presumably related to the parenterally transmitted non-A, non-B agents than to iron overload.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred ninety patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated according to random assignment with an intravenous infusion of either 80 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) over 3 h or 1.5 million units of streptokinase over 1 h. Patients received an intravenous bolus of heparin (5,000 U [USP]) before pretreatment coronary angiography and a continuous infusion (1,000 U/h) starting 3 h later. The frequency of major and minor hemorrhagic events (33% rt-PA, 31% streptokinase) and associated transfusions (22% rt-PA, 20% streptokinase) were comparable in both groups. More than 70% of bleeding episodes in each group occurred at catheterization or vascular puncture sites. Precipitable fibrinogen levels, measured in plasma samples collected in the presence of a protease inhibitor (aprotinin), declined in rt-PA and streptokinase groups by averages of 26 and 57% at 3 h and by 33 and 58% at 5 h, respectively (rt-PA versus streptokinase, p less than 0.001). At 5 h the plasma plasminogen declined by 57% (rt-PA) and 82% (streptokinase) (p less than 0.001); plasma fibrin(ogen) degradation products were higher in streptokinase-treated patients (244 +/- 12 micrograms/ml, mean +/- SE) than in rt-PA-treated patients (97 +/- 9 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.001). At 27 h, plasma fibrinogen and plasminogen levels were lower and fibrin(ogen) degradation products higher than pretreatment levels in both groups. The frequency of hemorrhagic events was higher in patients with greater changes in plasma factors at 5 h; within treatment groups the levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products correlated with bleeding complications (p less than 0.005). Thus, in the doses administered, rt-PA induces systemic fibrinogenolysis that is substantially less intense than that induced by streptokinase. The high frequency of bleeding encountered is related to the protocol used, including vigorous anticoagulation, arterial punctures and thrombolytic therapy. These findings emphasize the need for avoidance of invasive procedures and for meticulous care in the selection and management of patients subjected to thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Twenty-eight additional patients with frequent spontaneous ventricular tachycardia or no inducible arrhythmia during electrophysiologic testing were treated on the basis of the findings of electrocardiographic (ECG) Holter monitoring. Tocainide was effective in 7 (13%) and partially effective in 5 (8%) of the 54 patients in the electrophysiologic study group and was effective in 17 (61%) of the 28 patients in the ECG monitoring group. History of previous myocardial infarction and failure of response to lidocaine correlated with failure to respond to tocainide. Side effects were common both during initial therapy and during long-term treatment and necessitated discontinuation of tocainide therapy in 17% of the patients. At a mean follow-up period of 14 months, 13 patients are still receiving tocainide and are arrhythmia-free. In conclusion, the usefulness of oral tocainide in the management of drug-refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation is limited because of its low effectiveness and frequent side effects.\r"

The mean maximum serum concentration of terfenadine metabolite I, 242 +/- 28 ng/ml, occurred at 2.3 +/- 0.2 hours; the mean serum half-life value was 2.0 +/- 0.1 hours. Wheals and flares after epicutaneous tests with histamine phosphate, 1.0 mg/ml and 0.2 mg/ml, were significantly suppressed from 1 to 8 hours after the terfenadine dose compared to predose values. Maximum wheal suppression occurred at from 3 to 6 hours. Itching was completely suppressed for 8 hours. No serious adverse effects occurred. Terfenadine in children appears to be well absorbed, and its carboxylic acid metabolite has a short serum elimination half-life. The duration of its suppressive effect on the histamine-induced wheal and flare greatly exceeds that expected from consideration of serum terfenadine metabolite I concentrations.\r"

Within each 24- or 48-hour simulation phase, a single administration set was used. Samples were withdrawn for bacterial analysis at 4- or 8-hour intervals. Simulations and samplings were completed under controlled, but not aseptic, conditions. Results indicated that bacterial growth was insignificant across all three simulation phases. Re-utilization of the administration set did not introduce bacterial contamination into subsequent liters of formula. Alcohol cleansing of the administration set was not found to be necessary for maintenance of bacterial closed integrity. Even when administered over a 24- or 48-hour period, the formula dispersed through this closed system did not develop any significant degree of bacterial growth. Results of this study suggest that this newly designed system for the administration of enteral formula significantly minimizes the risk of bacterial contamination.\r"

  ".W": "The calcium ionophore A23187, at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, is able to stimulate proliferation of freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes, CD4+-enriched cells, or CD8+-enriched cells as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. This proliferation is accompanied by an increase in interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor expression but not by a detectable up-regulation in (IL-2) production or the development of cytotoxicity. Proliferation can be blocked by anti-CD3, CD4, or CD8 monoclonal antibodies, but not by anti-Tac. If CD8+-enriched cells are activated for 3 days with A23187 and the blasts present on day 3 are sorted and returned to culture, they rapidly develop cytolytic activity in the presence of recombinant IL-2 but not recombinant interferon-gamma. CD4+ enriched cells, after activation with A23187, do not become cytotoxic in the presence of either recombinant IL-2 or recombinant interferon-gamma. These findings permit study of the stepwise maturation of T cells in this alternative pathway by using \"minimal signals\" that do not, by themselves and as used in these studies, stimulate precursor Tc to mature to full effector cytotoxic function. These findings are consistent with the model that A23187 drives T cells only part way along a pathway of maturation and that an additional second signal must be given to effect maturation of cytotoxic status.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro cultivation of primed T cells with antigen resulted in the induction of a regulatory T cell that nonspecifically augmented the in vitro antibody responses of H-2-compatible T and B cells. This T cell, designated as the augmenting T cell (Ta), was unable to help B cells by itself but enhanced the antibody response of B cells to several multitudes only when conventional helper T (Th) cells or cloned Th cells from the same H-2 haplotype coexisted. Ta was radioresistant and belonged to Lyt-1+, 2-, L3T4+, I-J- T cell lineage. Ta exhibited interesting H-2-restricted activities: when primed T cells from (A X B) F1 were cultured with the antigen in the presence of parent A type antigen-presenting cells, the induced Ta was able to augment the antibody response of (A x B) F1 B cells in the presence of Th cells from F1----A but not from F1----B radiation bone marrow chimeras. This indicates that the induction of Ta in an F1 T cell population is dependent on the H-2 haplotype of antigen-presenting cells during in vitro cultivation. The restriction specificity of the established Ta is, however, not directed to the class II antigen itself but to the restriction specificity of Th cells that recognize class II antigen. In support of this is the fact that the elimination of A-restricted Th cells during cultivation by treatment with anti-I-J mAb, which is known to react with H-2-restricted Th cells, resulted in failure of induction of Ta cells having the augmenting activity for the A-restricted response.\r"

  ".W": "We identified a variant murine cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone which, in contrast to the parent clone and all other murine T cell populations tested, was found to have acquired spontaneously the ability to produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2). IFN-gamma production in response to concanavalin A (Con A), which was characteristic of all T cell populations tested, was preserved in this variant. The IFN produced by the variant in response to either stimulus was active in both a macrophage-activating factor assay and an anti-viral assay. Both activities induced by either stimulus could be blocked by monoclonal anti-IFN-gamma antibodies. Upon Northern blot analysis using an IFN-gamma-specific cDNA probe, the IFN-gamma RNA isolated from variant cells stimulated with Con A or IL-2 were found to migrate equivalently. The unusual pattern of responsiveness in this variant CTL was exploited to compare the mechanisms involved in induction of IFN-gamma production by Con A or IL-2. Striking differences were observed. Unlike IFN-gamma production induced by Con A, IFN-gamma production induced by IL-2 was not accompanied by an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, did not require physiologic extracellular Ca2+ levels, and was not inhibited by the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A. Thus, in this variant CTL clone, conditions that have ordinarily been associated in an obligate manner with lymphokine gene expression were found instead to be related to the specific mode of stimulation.\r"

Isolation and characterization of class II-restricted T cell hybridomas from BALB/c and A/J mice undergoing a primary response has revealed that a single region of the protein, residues 12-26, is the immunodominant site. Fine specificity analysis using truncated peptides (P12-24 and P15-26) reveals a great deal of heterogeneity at the clonal level of I-Ad-restricted T cells. I-Ek-restricted T cells are less heterogeneous in their reactivity toward P12-24 and P15-26, but show diversity in their responses to peptide analogues with substitution at Tyr22. The specificity difference between T cell hybridomas of I-Ad-restriction and I-Ek-restriction and the inhibition effect of different inactive peptides suggest that the same peptide is presented in different configurations by different Ia molecules. Further, no cross-reactivity can be detected between T cells of these two haplotypes, Ia molecules and Ia bound-peptides.\r"

Data show that the requirement for the L3T4+ T cell depends on either the type of tissue transplanted or type of the antigenic disparity between donor and recipient. Data also indicate that islet allograft acceptance achieved after GK1.5 treatment of the recipient is not due to tolerance induction. We therefore conclude that the cellular requirements for allograft rejection are determined by the type of tissue transplanted and the genetic disparity between donor and recipient.\r"

After infection, these T4-positive, Fc epsilon R-positive T cells manifested a fourfold increase in the surface interleukin 2 receptor, a 10-fold increase in Fc epsilon R, and acquired viral markers not present in the uninfected cells. Cloning soon after transformation allowed for the isolation of 17 distinct T cell clones producing IgE-binding factors. The levels of these binding factors released in supernatant fluid from these clones ranged from 10 to 98 U (negative less than 1 U) using a radioimmunoassay. Furthermore, the presence and kinetics of production of these binding factors also could be demonstrated by metabolic labeling studies. These cells should prove potent immunologic tools for dissecting the various regulatory mechanisms involved in IgE production both in the normal state and in pathologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Stable human antigen-specific monoclonal B cell lines were established without prior in vivo immunization. This was accomplished by expanding the anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) B cells in vitro with the antigen TNP-Brucella abortus and then immortalizing them with Epstein-Barr virus. Five anti-TNP clones were selected by sequential limiting dilution. All five anti-TNP clones secreted IgM kappa antibodies. When tested against a panel of self and environmental antigens, all five anti-TNP clones exhibited cross-reactivity with an Escherichia coli-derived beta-galactosidase. To determine whether this was a more general phenomenon, a panel of murine monoclonals were tested and found to bind to beta-galactosidase. It is therefore possible that human and murine anti-TNP beta cell responses reflect reactivity against an environmental antigen, namely an epitope present on E. coli-derived beta-galactosidase. This approach of expanding human antigen-specific B cells by antigen stimulation in vitro, with a T-independent hapten-carrier conjugate before Epstein-Barr virus transformation, may prove useful in the development of human monoclonals for therapeutic purposes.\r"

In the absence of the other IL-2-binding molecule, the 55-kDa molecule binds IL-2 with a relatively low affinity and the 75 kDa molecule binds IL-2 with an intermediate affinity. One of the earliest events following interaction of IL-2 with its receptor on the surface of cells is an increase in intracellular pH due to activation of the Na+/H+ antiport. In contrast to IL-2-induced proliferation of human IL-2-sensitive T cells, interaction of IL-2 with a low affinity binding site was sufficient to activate the Na+/H+ antiport. By determining the effect of IL-2 on cytosolic pH in cells that express one of the two IL-2-binding molecules in the absence of the other IL-2-binding molecule, we have demonstrated that interaction of IL-2 with the 75 kDa IL-2-binding molecule is sufficient to activate the Na+/H+ antiport and thus induce cytosolic alkalinization. This indicates that the 75-kDa IL-2-binding molecule, in the absence of the 55-kDa IL-2-binding molecule, forms a functional receptor that can transduce an activation signal across the cell membrane.\r"

  ".W": "The murine Ly-6A.2 and Ly-6E.1 antigens, which can transduce triggering signals in T cells, have been shown to become highly expressed after mitogenic stimulation. It has recently been found that enhanced expression of Ly-6A/E antigens is also induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in resting T cells. Here, the possibility is investigated that Ly-6A/E induction on activated T cells may be due to the IFN-gamma known to be secreted by these cells. A potent neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody (mAb) (H-22.10) was used. This mAb was found to abrogate the augmentation of Ly-6A/E antigens produced in resting T cells by supernatants from T cells stimulated with concanavalin A. When added directly into cultures of T cells stimulated with concanavalin A or by the combination of ionomycin with the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the H-22.10 mAb inhibited Ly-6A/E enhancement without affecting the blastogenesis or the emergence of interleukin 2 receptors and transferrin receptors. Such a selective effect of the anti-IFN-gamma mAb indicated that IFN-gamma is involved in the up-regulation of Ly-6A/E antigens during T cell activation. In determining whether other activation signals, in addition to IFN-gamma receptor occupancy, may contribute to Ly-6A/E enhancement, it was found that suboptimal stimulation of BALB/c T cells provided by a 3-hr pulse with ionomycin plus PMA or by culture with PMA alone potentiated by about twofold the increase of Ly-6E.1 induced by exogenous IFN-gamma. Therefore, Ly-6A/E augmentation in activated T cells reflects primarily an action of endogenous IFN-gamma that is amplified (in BALB/c mice) by a protein kinase C-dependent step.\r"

However, small concentrations of MuIFN-gamma when combined with small concentrations of either HuIL-1 or MuTNF activated these macrophages to produce cytotoxic effects against L5178Y cells; small concentrations of HuIL-1 and MuTNF in combination had no macrophage activating activity. Specific antibody to MuTNF blocked the macrophage-activating synergistic effects of MuIFN-gamma + HuIL-1, and specific antibody to HuIL-1 blocked the macrophage-activating activity of MuIFN-gamma + MuTNF, indicating that MuTNF was induced in macrophage cultures treated with MuIFN-gamma + HuIL-1, and that murine IL-1 was induced in macrophage cultures treated with MuIFN-gamma + MuTNF. These results indicate that all three cytokines are required for induction of antitumor cytotoxic activation of macrophages. Experiments with a concentration of MuIFN-gamma which alone could activate macrophages revealed that both MuTNF and murine IL-1 were required for this activation. The demonstration that small concentrations of these three cytokines can act synergistically, but not separately, to activate macrophages indicates the importance of cytokine combinations in immunoregulation and in anti-tumor cell-mediated immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently shown that interleukin 4 (IL-4) (formerly called BSF-1) is a potent stimulator of fetal and adult immature thymocyte proliferation and that adult L3T4-/Lyt-2-thymocytes can be stimulated by calcium ionophore (A23187) and phorbol ester to secrete IL-4 (Zlotnik, A., J. Ransom, G. Frank, M. Fischer, and M. Howard. 1987. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 84:3856). This report shows that fetal thymocytes (day 15 of gestation) can also be activated to produce IL-4 suggesting that IL-4 may be a mediator of fetal as well as adult immature thymocyte proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) inhibits the IL-4-mediated proliferation of both fetal and adult L3T4-/Lyt-2-thymocytes. The inhibition of proliferation is blocked by anti-IFN-gamma antibody and is unaffected by indomethacin suggesting that IFN-gamma directly inhibits immature thymocyte proliferation. IFN-gamma does not block the IL-4/phorbol myristate acetate-mediated proliferation of an adult thymocyte population, which is enriched for L3T4-/Lyt-2+ and L3T4+/Lyt-2- cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma is limited to the immature thymocyte population. Both fetal (day 15) and adult L3T4-/Lyt-2--thymocytes can be activated to secrete an IFN-gamma like activity. This activity is neutralized by a monoclonal anti-IFN-gamma antibody indicating that the activity is due to IFN-gamma. mRNA analysis of adult L3T4-/Lyt-2- thymocytes stimulated with A23187 and phorbol myristate acetate confirms that mRNA for both IL-4 and IFN-gamma is induced in adult L3T4-/Lyt-2- thymocytes. These results indicate that IL-4 and IFN-gamma can regulate immature thymocyte proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "It has been previously reported that a combination pair of anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) T11(2)+T11(3) induces a strong proliferation of T cells, which does not require the involvement of accessory cells and exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2). More recently, we have shown that the requirement for optimal T cell proliferation depends on the combination pairs of anti-CD2 mAb used. Among them, anti-GT2+T11(1) mAb do not allow optimal proliferation of TA4 helper cloned T cells due, at least in part, to a low level of IL-2 production. This observation offered us the opportunity to study the effect of IL-2 on its own production. We show here that stimulation of cloned TA4 cells with anti-GT2+T11(1) mAb induces only a marginal level of IL-2 production. By contrast, significantly higher levels of IL-2 activity are detected in the culture supernatant of TA4 cells preincubated with recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) before stimulation with anti-GT2+T11(1) mAb. This effect is dose-dependent over a wide range (5 to 50 IU/ml) of rIL-2 concentrations added during preincubation time. In addition, it is not due to carryover of rIL-2 bound during the preincubation time, or to lesser IL-2 consumption by these cells, or to increasing numbers of IL-2-producing cells induced by exogenous IL-2. Moreover, the observation was confirmed with IL-2 mRNA. Although neither rIL-2 nor anti-GT2+T11(1) mAb alone could induce a significant production of IL-2, rIL-2 appears to up-regulate its own production when the TA4 cells are activated by the anti-CD2 mAb-mediated second signal.\r"

The results demonstrated that specificity for hen egg white lysozyme vs two haptens (dinitrophenyl or galactan) is H chain determined and for one set of proteins could be attributed specifically to the H3 region. In contrast to hapten vs lysozyme specificity, when reassociated molecules derived from structurally unrelated antibodies that bound nonoverlapping epitopes on lysozyme were tested, localization of binding to a particular epitope on lysozyme could be predominated by either H or L chains. Furthermore, in some cases, unique specificities distinct from those of either parental antibody were formed. Replacement of the native L chain with an isotypically homologous L chain was more likely to restore high affinity protein binding than was replacement of a less related L chain. When isotypically homologous L chains were compared in association with the same H chain, fine specificity profiles were sensitive to substitutions in as few as two residues that could be attributed to somatic mutation. These results demonstrate that both affinity and specificity derive from very subtle interactions between H and L chains and provide examples of how VH assembly, VL-VH pairing, and somatic mutation could contribute to development and maturation of the specificity repertoire.\r"

YM-10 effluent- and amphotericin B-stimulated ingestion is completely abrogated by treating the PMN with either pertussis toxin (PT), cholera toxin (CT), or a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 1C2. However, neither toxin nor mAb 1C2 affects nonstimulated ingestion or phagocytosis stimulated by phorbol esters or synthetic diacylglycerol. Increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels by stimulation with prostaglandin E1 and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine, does not mimic the effect of either toxin or mAb 1C2. In addition, toxin-mediated inhibition is not due to loss of either the Fc receptor recognized by mAb 3G8 or the antigen recognized by mAb 1C2. These data indicate that both CT and PT regulate the phagocytic response of PMN, in a manner like mAb 1C2, probably by affecting a guanosine 5'-triphosphate-binding protein distinct from those that regulate adenylate cyclase. Since phorbol ester-stimulated ingestion is not inhibited by either PT, CT, or mAb 1C2 and phorbol esters activate protein kinase C directly, phagocytosis amplification regulated by PT, CT, and mAb 1C2 may involve protein kinase C activation.\r"

  ".W": "Human leukocytes generate platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether), a lipid mediator of inflammation, from membrane alkyl phospholipids through the release of arachidonic acid or other fatty acids at the 2-position and subsequent acetylation. Because it was previously demonstrated that fish oil fatty acids suppress human leukocyte arachidonic acid release and metabolism, separate experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of dietary fish oil supplementation and in vitro incubation with fish oil fatty acids on calcium ionophore-stimulated PAF-acether generation in human monocytes. In subjects on their regular diets, a 4-hr incubation of monocyte monolayers with an optimally effective concentration of arachidonic acid of 1 micrograms/ml resulted in a 64% increase of calcium ionophore-induced net PAF-acether generation from 7.75 +/- 0.78 ng/10(6) cells for untreated monolayers to 12.70 +/- 1.21 ng/10(6) cells (mean +/- SEM). Treatment of monolayers with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) at the optimal concentration of 1 micrograms/ml decreased net PAF-acether generation by 28%. However, treatment of monocyte monolayers with docosahexaenoic acid did not appreciably affect net PAF-acether generation. The changes in PAF-acether release with each fatty acid added in vitro paralleled those in total PAF-acether generation; the percentage PAF-acether release remained unaffected. Three weeks of dietary supplementation with 18 g MaxEPA daily, providing 3.2 g EPA did not affect the PAF-acether generation of calcium ionophore-stimulated human monocyte monolayers. However, 6 weeks of dietary supplementation resulted in a 47% decrease of net total PAF-acether generation and a concomitant 59% decline in net PAF-acether release; the percentage release of PAF-acether was not affected. Thus, whether added to the diet or introduced in vitro, fish oil-derived fatty acids suppress PAF-acether generation by human monocyte monolayers.\r"

Two clones were able to lyse targets infected with typhus group rickettsiae. One of these clones was more fully characterized because of its rapid growth characteristics. This cytolytic clone was capable of lysing an autologous infected target as well as a target matched for class I and II histocompatibility leukocyte antigens (HLA). It was not capable, however, of lysing either a target mismatched for both class I and II HLA or a target partially matched for class I HLA. In addition, the clone exhibited specificity in that it was able to lyse an autologous target infected with typhus group rickettsiae, but did not lyse an autologous target infected with an antigenically distinct rickettsial species, Rickettsia tsutsugamushi. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that cells infected with intracellular bacteria can be lysed by human cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\r"

In 16 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis, their concanavalin A-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses, interferon-gamma and interleukin 2 activities and the ability of their concanavalin A-induced lymphokines to kill monocyte intracellular amastigotes were not different from normal controls. Antigen-stimulated lymphocyte cultures showed that 13 of 13 patients had an increased lymphocyte proliferative response; 11 of 16 produced interleukin 2 and 12 of 13 produced interferon-gamma; in addition, 10 of 11 of these antigen-induced supernatants increased the monocytes' killing of Leishmania major amastigotes. Antibody levels to parasite membrane antigens determined by radioimmunoassay showed that 8 of 13 titers were greater than 10 and 4 of 13 titers were 2 to 10 times higher than control. Our findings demonstrate that patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis elicit a specific immune response to L. major antigens and part of this response is the production of lymphokine capable of promoting monocyte killing of intracellular amastigotes.\r"

On immunoblotting, the 68,000 m.w. antigen was common to S. mansoni adults and schistosomula, whereas parasite eggs contained only cross-reacting low m.w. antigens of 19,100 and 16,000. Immunization resulted in the development of anti-antigen antibody and enhanced immediate cutaneous hypersensitivity to the 31-3B6 antigen. By contrast, delayed-type hypersensitivity and sensitization to circumoval granuloma formation were not observed in immunized mice.

These constructs were introduced into myeloma cells, and lines containing stably integrated genes were selected. The integrated Ig genes were then amplified by selection of the cells in increasing concentrations of methotrexate. The extent of gene amplification, mRNA accumulation, and production of Ig was studied in transfectomas containing introduced light chain genes, heavy chain genes, or both. When the light chain gene was introduced alone, it was expressed at low levels, but after selection with methotrexate, light chain expression was increased as much as 63-fold. In contrast, the transfected heavy chain genes were highly expressed, but production of the corresponding protein was increased a maximum of only fourfold by methotrexate treatment. Cellular toxicity of unassembled heavy chain monomer was not observed, even at amounts equivalent to 2% of total cellular protein. Cointroduction of the heavy and light chain constructs with subsequent amplification resulted in as much as 25-fold increase in secretion of intact antibody relative to unamplified cells. The results demonstrate that amplification of Ig genes can induce transfectomas to secrete antibody at nearly the rate of hybridomas.\r"

Suppression of Igh-1b anti-sheep red blood cell plaque-forming cells was measured as late as 4 wk after the injection of allotype heterozygous (Igha/b) spleen cells, antiserum, and sheep red blood cells. Suppression was maintained on retransfer of the allotype-suppressed spleen cells to further irradiated recipients in the absence of additional exogenous anti-allotype antibody. Mixing experiments were performed to test the putative inhibitory effects of allotype-suppressed spleen cells from the first adoptive transfer (stage I) on the antibody response of normal spleen cells in a second adoptive transfer (stage II). No suppression was observed by using unfractionated stage I spleen cells. In contrast, when these allotype-suppressed spleen cells were depleted of T cells, they strongly inhibited the antibody production of admixed normal spleen cells in stage II. This inhibitory activity of antibody-induced stage I spleen cells was directed primarily toward the target allotype, but some suppression of the Igh-1a plaque-forming cell response and total IgG production also occurred. Although removal of adherent cells did not affect the inhibitory activity of allotype-suppressed spleen cells from stage I, removal of Ig+ cells completely abrogated the inhibitory activity. These results suggest that antibody-induced regulatory B cells may play a role in maintaining long term allotype suppression.\r"

During the course of studies characterizing a recently described sulfated proteoglycan that is specifically associated with Ia, we discovered that there were also nonproteoglycan sulfated components present in the Ia immunoprecipitates. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel analysis of these latter sulfated components derived from both DR and DQ immunoprecipitates indicated that these components have mobilities indistinguishable from conventional Ia alpha and beta glycoproteins. Two-dimensional gel analysis confirmed these findings and revealed that Ia-associated invariant proteins are sulfated as well. The sulfate moiety was not removed by endoglycosidase F treatment, suggesting that the protein portion of the molecule was sulfated. These results indicate that Ia alpha-, beta-, and invariant chains can be sulfated and raise the possibility that sulfation may play a role in the physiology of Ia molecules.\r"

  ".U": "88088801\r", 
  ".W": "The YE1/48 antigen, defined by two rat monoclonal antibodies YE1/48 and YE1/32, is a disulfide-linked dimer of 45- to 50-kDa subunits expressed on murine T cells. It has previously been described as a T cell receptor alpha/beta-like molecule because of its similar m.w., dimeric structure, and isoelectric points comparable to those of the murine T cell receptor. We have now further characterized this antigen, directly compared it with the T cell receptor, and obtained internal amino acid sequences from the purified and trypsin-digested antigen. Endoglycosidase F treatment revealed the peptide cores of the antigen to be approximately 32 to 38kDa under reducing conditions and they possess at least three glycosylation side-chains. On diagonal gel analysis (nonreducing vs reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), the YE1/48 antigen and the T cell antigen receptor alpha/beta immunoprecipitated from thymocytes are indistinguishable. However, the two molecules can be distinguished on EL-4 cells by sequential immunoprecipitation using the YE1/48 monoclonal antibody and a rabbit antiserum reactive with the murine T cell receptor. Furthermore, two MBL-2 variant clones, which differ in the level of YE1/48 antigen expression by more than 200-fold, express comparable level of the T cell receptor. Therefore, the YE1/48 antigen and the T cell antigen receptor alpha/beta seem to be different molecules. The YE1/48 antigen was purified from MBL-2(4.1) cells by affinity chromatography and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, digested with trypsin and the resultant peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequences of several of the YE1/48 tryptic peptides were determined. Upon comparison with the protein sequences in the data base, no identical sequences were detected. These results demonstrated that the YE1/48 antigen is clearly different from the T cell receptor alpha-, beta-, or gamma- chain gene products, and it is a novel T cell antigen not previously described. However, the possibility of homology with other proteins remains undetermined because the tryptic peptides are too short to yield meaningful statistical comparison with the data base.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one clones from an early culture of a histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II negative human metastatic melanoma (Me 9229) were screened for susceptibility to phenotypic modulation induced by recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) by using SPV-L3, a monoclonal antibody to HLA-DQ antigens, in indirect immunofluorescence followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. After treatment with 500 U/ml of rIFN-gamma for 3 days one of the clones (9229/18) expressed high levels of DQ antigens, in terms of percentage of positive cells, whereas many other clones were much less susceptible or remained DQ negative. Scatchard analysis of the data of specific binding of 125-I-labeled rIFN-gamma revealed that one clone susceptible (9229/18) and one clone resistant (9229/5) to HLA-DQ modulation expressed similar numbers of interferon-gamma binding sites per cell; dose-response experiments showed that all clones could be induced to express HLA-DR and -DP antigens after exposure to rIFN-gamma. However, the DQ-negative profile of clone 9229/5 was not modified even after incubation with up to 1 X 10(4) U/ml of rIFN-gamma or by extending the culture time in the presence of this lymphokine up to 120 hr. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis indicated a direct correlation between changes in the levels of HLA-DR and -DQ-specific mRNA after rIFN-gamma treatment, and the lack or expression of HLA class II antigens at the cell surface of the two different clones. Karyotype studies did not reveal differences between clones 9229/5 and 9229/18 and Southern blot analysis indicated that both clones had similar EcoRI and HindIII restriction patterns for DR and DQ gene sequences. Finally, strong DQ-specific mRNA signal and antigen expression at the cell surface could be induced even on clone 9229/5 by treating the cells with supernatants from mixed lymphocyte cultures, recently shown to contain a class II-inducing factor different from interferon-gamma. Taken together these results indicate that DQ antigens can be modulated even in clones resistant to rIFN-gamma induction and suggest that the differential susceptibility observed in response to this lymphokine could play a role in the genesis of the phenomenon of intratumor heterogeneity.\r"

Both effects of IL-2 could be inhibited by prostaglandin E2, a potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase; however, the inhibitory effect of prostaglandin E2 could be overcome by increased concentrations of IL-2. The opposite effects of IL-2 and prostaglandin E2 were paralleled by their respective abilities to inhibit and stimulate cAMP production in intact cells. Other agents, which inhibit adenylate cyclase directly (somatostatin, beta-endorphin, UK 14.3041) or indirectly by activation of protein kinase C (phenylephrine), could stimulate both differentiation and proliferation. None of these agents alone or in combination were as effective as maximal concentrations of IL-2. However, all agents potentiated differentiation and proliferation induced by submaximal and maximal concentrations of IL-2. Additionally, combinations of agents which stimulated protein kinase C with those that inhibited adenylate cyclase were additive in the potentiation of IL-2-induced differentiation. Neither inhibition nor potentiation of IL-2-induced lymphokine-activated killer cell differentiation was accompanied by changes in Tac expression or gamma-interferon production. The data indicate that the stimulation of lymphokine-activated killer cell differentiation and lymphocyte proliferation in human cells share a common initial biochemical signal. Although the inhibition of adenylate cyclase is not sufficient to maximally stimulate either process and cannot bypass the requirement for IL-2, modulation of this enzyme complex, positively or negatively, can regulate the ultimate physiologic response to IL-2.\r"

It was found: 1) that pertussis toxin interferes with the first pathway of T cell activation insofar as it can substitute for phytohemagglutinin or monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD3 surface proteins, suggesting that a G protein serves as transducer for signals via the T cell receptor-CD3 complex; and 2) that fluoride ions induce the release of diacylglycerol (DAG) from [3H] arachidonic acid or [3H]oleic acid-prelabeled cells. In [3H]inositol or 32P-prelabeled cells, the increase in DAG production was also found to be accompanied by a 280% increase of intracellular inositol phosphate (IP), without significant modification of IP2 and IP3. These results suggest that a G protein controls the activity of a phospholipase C in Jurkat cells that upon stimulation releases DAG but not IP3. Inasmuch as DAG, like the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, activates protein kinase C, it suggests that a G protein is also involved in the transduction of the second signal for lymphocyte activation. Fluoride ions were found to be as effective as tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate to stimulate IL-2 synthesis in Jurkat cells when used in combination with phytohemagglutinin. Finally, cholera toxin and guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)-triphosphate were found to increase intracellular cyclic adenosine triphosphate and to inhibit IL-2 synthesis. All together these results suggest that several G proteins are involved in the transduction of the two signals necessary for T cell activation as well as in the negative regulation of IL-2 synthesis.\r"

In an effort to understand underlying mechanisms, the effect of EFA deficiency on the generation of eicosanoids and the elicitation of leukocytes in a model of acute inflammation was examined. Acute inflammation was induced by the i.p. injection of zymosan in mice. The injection of zymosan in normal mice was followed by a short burst of eicosanoid synthesis lasting 2 hr. Leukotriene (LT)B4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were detected using high pressure liquid chromatography and specific radioimmunoassays. This initial phase of eicosanoid production was followed by a more prolonged infiltration of leukocytes (predominantly polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN)) lasting 48 hr with little eicosanoid synthesis. When challenged with zymosan, EFA-deficient mice exhibited a marked decrease in the production of eicosanoids during the early phase. No LTB could be detected at all. The number of resident peritoneal macrophages in EFA-deficient mice was also substantially decreased, and the influx of PMN during the inflammatory response was markedly diminished. In order to establish that the generation of eicosanoids during the early phase of this model of acute inflammation played a causal role in the later infiltration of PMN, the effect of the mixed lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase inhibitor, BW755C, on LTB formation and PMN influx in this model of inflammation was assessed in control animals. BW755C completely blocked LTB synthesis and inhibited the subsequent influx of PMN. In conclusion, EFA deficiency inhibits eicosanoid generation, depresses levels of resident macrophages, and markedly diminishes the influx of PMN in the acute inflammatory response. The decrease in PMN influx appears to result from the inhibition of the antecedent generation of LTB.\r"

  ".W": "Paf-acether or platelet-activating factor (1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a phospholipid mediator of inflammation initially described as a potent platelet-aggregating compound. It is newly formed by a variety of cells including monocytes and is now recognized as a major mediator of cell-cell interactions. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether paf-acether could modulate T cell function. We found that addition of paf-acether to CD4+ cells cultured with phytohemagglutinin markedly inhibited the proliferative response in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal inhibition occurred when paf-acether was present during the first 24 hr of cell culture and the presence of paf-acether did not alter the kinetics of CD4+ cell proliferation. Importantly, the mechanism by which paf-acether inhibited the proliferative response was not related to inhibition of interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion since the amount of IL-2 in cultures was not altered and addition of exogenous IL-2 failed to restore the CD4+ cell proliferative response. Further, as judged by indirect immunofluorescence, paf-acether did not inhibit IL-2 receptor expression. Taken together, these data indicate that paf-acether interferes with some processes leading to CD4+ cell proliferation. This new role for the chemically defined monokine paf-acether emphasizes the potential role of inflammatory lipid mediators in the regulation of T cell response.\r"

  ".W": "The question of genetic linkage of parasite-specific immune responses to resistance to infection in experimental African trypanosomiasis was addressed. For this purpose, major histocompatibility complex-compatible resistant and susceptible inbred mouse strains and their F1 hybrid, F2 hybrid, and backcross offspring were infected with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense LouTat 1. Immunologic control of the first peak of parasitemia and survival times were the parameters measured. As we have reported previously (R. F. Levine and J. M. Mansfield, J. Immunol. 133:1564, 1984), B10.BR/SgSnJ mice are relatively resistant and controlled the growth of the infecting variant antigenic type (VAT) by mounting an antibody response to exposed epitopes of the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG). Fluctuating parasitemias resulting from sequential growth of different variable antigenic types occurred subsequently, and these mice died with a median survival time of 48 days. C3HeB/FeJ mice, relatively susceptible, did not control the infecting VAT and did not exhibit VSG-specific antibodies. These mice died with a median survival time of 22 days. The (B10.BR X C3H)F1 hybrids derived from crosses between resistant and susceptible mice all exhibited VSG-specific antibody responses and controlled the infecting VAT population. However, the median survival time of the F1 hybrids (24 days) was not significantly different from the survival time of the susceptible C3H parent. These findings demonstrate for the first time that antibody-mediated control of parasitemia is inherited as a dominant trait; that overall resistance, as measured by survival time, is inherited as a recessive trait (e.g., susceptibility is dominant); and that the two events segregate independently of one another. Further analyses of the inheritance of immunity and resistance (survival time) were made in which the F2 hybrid and backcross studies revealed that there are multiple genes controlling the VSG-specific antibody response as well as determining susceptibility. An extension of the present studies to a similar but non-major histocompatibility complex-mouse model system of resistance and susceptibility (C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice, F1 hybrids, and 11 recombinant inbred B X H strains derived from them) was made in order to link the strain distribution patterns of known genetic markers with control of VSG-specific antibody responses or with control of susceptibility. Results of this study showed that resistance varied independently of the ability to control parasitemia with VSG-specific B cell responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Moreover, we have cloned the two different V beta germ-line counterparts whose sequences confirm that these two V beta are not pseudogenes. Analysis of T cell receptor beta and alpha rearrangements in PH28 showed that a single rearrangement on each chromosome could be assigned either at the J beta or the J gamma loci.

  ".W": "The proliferation of human T lymphocytes is regulated, in part, by the coordinated expression of genes encoding T cell growth factor (interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-2 receptors, and transferrin receptors (TFR). We examined the time course of accumulation of mRNA for these genes in T cells stimulated with the phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, and compared their expression to T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. In cells treated with PDB/ionomycin, maximum expression was observed at 3 hr for IL-2 mRNA and at 6 hr for TFR mRNA, whereas the level of IL-2 receptor mRNA reached a peak 24 to 48 hr after stimulation. In phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cells IL-2 mRNA was detectable within 3 hr but peaked later at 12 hr; the level of IL-2 receptor mRNA similarly peaked 24 to 48 hr later. Accumulation of TFR mRNA in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cells, however, was not detectable at 6 hr and reached a peak only between 12 to 24 hr. The early accumulation of TFR mRNA in PDB/ionomycin-stimulated T cells seemed, in part, independent of the interaction of IL-2 with its own receptor, because TFR mRNA was detectable as early as 1 hr after stimulation and addition of cycloheximide before addition of PDB/ionomycin did not abolish the PDB/ionomycin-induced accumulation of TFR mRNA. In addition, either PDB or ionomycin used alone induced the expression of TFR mRNA but not IL-2 mRNA. These results indicated that the combination of PDB/ionomycin accelerated the expression of IL-2 and TFR genes in T cells compared to phytohemagglutinin and triggered an IL-2-independent pathway for the induction of TFR mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "88088830\r", 
  ".W": "Previous study demonstrated that anti-H-43a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response of H-43b CWB (H-2b) stain carrying non-major histocompatability complex (MHC) genes of C3H and F1 strains raised by crossing CWB with various H-43b strains was restricted exclusively by self H-2Kb (Kb). In the present study, newly produced C3W strain (H-2k, H-43b), which is H-43-congenic to C3H/HeN (H-2k, H-43a), was used as H-43b mice, and possibility of immunodominance of Kb was examined. No anti-H-43a CTL response could be induced in C3W strain and F1 strains raised by crossing C3W with other H-43b strains not carrying Kb. Thus, the possibility of immunodominance of Kb over the other MHC class I alleles could not be supported. We also examined possibility of epistatic effect of I region genes and non-MHC genes on the Kb restriction. (C3W x C57BL/6)F1(I-Ak/b) and (C3W x B6.CH-2bm12)F1(I-Ak/bm12)mice showed equally anti-H-43a CTL response restricted exclusively by self Kb, and (C3W x B10.MBR)F1(Ik/k) mice also showed anti-H-43a CTL response restricted solely by self Kb. Cold target competition experiments demonstrated that H-43b C57BL/10 or A.BY mice, which do not have non-MHC genes of C3H mounted anti-H-43a CTL response restricted solely by self Kb. Thus, no relation of I region genes or non-MHC genes to the Kb restriction was shown. All the results indicate that H-43b mouse strains, including F1, can not achieve anti-H-43a CTL response unless they carry Kb allele. Notably, (C3W x C57BL/6)F1 mice mounted self Kb-restricted anti-H-43a CTL response, whereas (C3W x B6.CH-2bm1)F1 mice carrying mutated Kb could not mount anti-H-43a CTL response at all. These findings indicate strongly that Kb itself is classical Ir gene of anti-H-43a CTL response and directs self Kb restriction of the response.\r"

Treatment with anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody suppressed autoimmune insulitis in nonobese diabetic mice and lupus nephritis in the NZB x NZW F1 hybrid.

However, when Tg or pepsin fragments of Tg were coupled with a carrier protein, tetanus toxoid (TT), MNC from four healthy TT vaccinated individuals responded to the carrier-autoantigen conjugates by generating anti-Tg antibody forming cells (AFC), as shown in a spot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Generation of anti-TT and anti-Tg AFC after stimulation with the conjugates required the donors to be boostered with TT. The autoantibodies were exclusively of the IgM class, in contrast to the carrier-specific anti-TT antibodies, which were predominantly of the IgG isotype. Activation of normal B cells to anti-Tg production was dependent on the presence of T cells in the cultures and required physical linkage of carrier and autoantigen: no anti-Tg AFC could be detected when MNC were stimulated with uncoupled combinations of Tg and TT. The autoreactive and the carrier-reactive B cells exhibited almost identical conjugate dose-response profiles, which suggest that they responded in a similar way to regulatory signals. These findings indicate that normal blood B cells are competent to respond to the autoantigen Tg in conjunction with signals originating from xeno-antigen-stimulated T cells.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we examined whether novel interleukin 2 (IL-2) binding molecules (p70/75) are responsible for signal transduction and internalization of IL-2 in T cells by using a monoclonal antibody H-31 to Tac antigens. We found that H-31 inhibited the binding of IL-2 to Tac antigens but not novel IL-2 binding molecules. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that in the presence of H-31, intermediate affinity sites (Kd = 1 to 1.5 nM) were detectable and the number of them was similar to that of high affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) (Kd = 10 to 15 pM) in the absence of H-31. Furthermore, the kinetics of endocytosis of IL-2 via p70/75 showed the same pattern as via high affinity IL-2R. Finally, high doses of IL-2 (100 to 10,000 U/ml) are required for the proliferation of T cells in the presence of H-31, whereas in the absence of H-31, physiologic doses of IL-2 (1 to 100 U/ml) induced the proliferation. These results taken together suggest that novel IL-2 binding molecules are related to signal transduction of IL-2 and that Tac antigens are essential for constructing of high affinity IL-2R, although Tac antigens may not be responsible for signal transduction.\r"

When tested alone, both classes of cytokines inhibited GM-CFU proliferation. In combination, PGE and all three types of recombinant interferons synergized in their ability to inhibit GM-CFU proliferation. Progressive enrichment for marrow GM-CFU indicated that the synergistic effects of PGE and interferon were dependent upon the presence of marrow-adherent cells. Studies using conditioned media from marrow-adherent cells prepared in the presence of interferon-alpha, -beta, and -gamma indicated that adherent cells produced a soluble factor in the presence of interferons that subsequently synergized with PGE in inhibiting GM-CFU proliferation. Neutralization of this conditioned media with a monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor abrogated the synergistic inhibition of GM-CFU observed in the presence of PGE. The addition of recombinant tumor necrosis factor and PGE to accessory cell-depleted bone marrow resulted in synergystic inhibition of GM-CFU proliferation.\r"

Treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enhanced the synthesis of 12 and 28 polypeptides, respectively. Exposure to interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) or interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) resulted in the increased synthesis of seven identical polypeptides. Treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) at 100 U/ml led to enhanced expression of seven polypeptides, whereas exposure to TNF at 1000 U/ml increased the levels of these seven plus two additional polypeptides. The antiviral and antiproliferative effects of these cytokines in strain 153 fibroblasts were also assessed. Both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma exhibited antiviral activity, whereas both IL-1 and TNF stimulated fibroblast growth. IFN-gamma was alone in inhibiting proliferation. Thus, although these cytokines exhibit low degrees of structural homology, they share some common functions, and a number of polypeptides were induced in common by two or more of these agents. The greatest similarities in polypeptide induction occur between IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma and between the IL-1s and TNF. However, polypeptides were also induced in common by IFN-alpha and TNF, IFN-gamma and IL-1, and IFN-gamma and TNF. These similarities in polypeptide induction may reflect the overlapping functions of these cytokines and may be indicative of common biochemical pathways in their mechanisms of action.\r"

However, the cells taken from LPS-non-responder C3H/HeJ mice which had been infected with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) prior to the experiment were capable of producing IFN in culture in the presence of LPS. The peritoneal exudate cells of BCG-primed C3H/HeJ mice were separated into adherent cell and nonadherent cell populations by their adhesiveness to plastic culture dishes. IFN production required the presence of both these cell populations in the same culture, and the IFN activities produced were mainly IFN-gamma. The cultures with nonadherent cells and fixed adherent cells still produced IFN, but the cell cultures reconstituted with the BCG-primed cell population and unprimed cell population produce little if any IFN-gamma. Moreover, when both of the populations were cultured in Marbrook culture vessels separated by a membrane filter, the cultures produced very little or no IFN-gamma. These results indicate that there is a mechanism of IFN-gamma induction by LPS which requires the direct contact between adherent cells and nonadherent cells without the participation of any soluble factor(s) from the adherent cells. The producer cells were mainly in the nonadherent cell population. Previous treatment of nonadherent cells with anti-Thy-1.2 antibody, anti-Lyt-1.1 antibody, anti-L3T4 antibody, or anti-asialo-GM1 antibody and complement diminished the ability of the cells for LPS-induced IFN production with the help of adherent cells. Therefore, it is concluded that both T cells (presumably L3T4+T cells) and asialo-GM1+ natural killer cells in the BCG-primed C3H/HeJ cell cultures produced IFN-gamma in the presence of LPS, and the production was supported by the function of macrophages.\r"

Tumoricidal activity was markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion when glucocorticoids were added simultaneously to the cultures with rIFN-gamma and But-LPS at concentrations ranging from 1 X 10(-10) to 1 X 10(-5) M. Nonglucocorticoid sex hormones failed to inhibit tumoricidal activity in this system under identical culture conditions. Inhibition was most effective if the glucocorticoids were added simultaneously with the priming and triggering signals (rIFN-gamma and But-LPS); however, if the glucocorticoids were added 24 hr after the signals were provided to the cultures, suboptimal inhibition was observed. Experiments that dissociated the priming phase of activation from the triggering phase showed that glucocorticoids inhibited both the rIFN-gamma-induced priming stage as well as the But-LPS-induced triggering stage of activation. These observations provide evidence that glucocorticoids, but not other steroid hormones, inhibit the activation of macrophages to a fully tumoricidal state by interfering with either the priming or triggering signals in this two-signal model of macrophage activation.\r"

The light chains of both were kappa, but had different electrophoretic mobilities on polyacrylamide gels. Amino acid sequence analysis, carbohydrate determinations, and biosynthetic experiments indicated that the difference seen in their electrophoretic mobility was due to the glycosylation of one but not the other kappa-chain. The primary structure of both chains demonstrated that they both used a V kappa 1 and a J kappa 2 gene segment and the same C kappa allele, Km(1,2), and that both contained the same junctional three amino acid deletion. However, they varied by 19 amino acids in the first 94 amino terminal residues encoded for by the V kappa gene, with some of the substitutions requiring two base changes in the appropriate codons. Moreover, the malignant \"clones\" producing the two proteins differed in their responses to chemotherapy. These data indicate that, although the two clones producing the serum proteins were different at the time of study, they may have arisen from the same precursor clone.\r"

  ".W": "A rabbit antibody to the neuraminidase of the infective form of Trypanosoma cruzi identifies a subpopulation of trypomastigotes that expresses neuraminidase. Complement-mediated lysis by the antibody selectively destroys 30 to 40% of the trypomastigotes, supporting the conclusion that the immune antibody binds to a subset of parasites. The trypomastigotes that react with the immune antibody are the only ones expressing neuraminidase because the trypomastigotes that survive complement-mediated lysis are depleted of neuraminidase activity. The enzyme seems to negatively modulate infection in vitro, since infection of host cells by trypomastigotes is enhanced when neuraminidase activity is blocked by antineuraminidase antibody; infection is also enhanced when the infecting trypomastigotes have been depleted of parasites that express neuraminidase. Addition of exogenous neuraminidase (from Vibrio cholerae) to trypomastigotes treated with immune antibody, reverts the enhancement observed when infection takes place in the presence of antibody to T. cruzi neuraminidase only. Addition of V. cholerae neuraminidase in the absence of immune antibodies has no effect on infection. These results show that T. cruzi neuraminidase depresses infection and also suggest that sialic acid is involved in the parasite-host cell interaction. The antibody to T. cruzi neuraminidase recognizes on the surface of live trypomastigotes a set of proteins with high m.w. (165,000 to 200,000) and also two antigens of 79,000 to 82,000. The high m.w. proteins appear to be associated with neuraminidase activity as shown by renaturation experiments of released enzyme fractionated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel.\r"

  ".U": "88088884\r", 
  ".W": "Sulfatide from the outer surface of Mycobacterium tuberculosis blocked priming in cultured human monocytes. Monocytes were primed in vitro with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon-gamma. Primed monocytes released increased amounts of superoxide anion (O2-) when stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or with phorbol myristate acetate. Primed monocytes also showed increased phagocytosis of sheep erythrocytes and increased release of interleukin 1. When primed monocytes were treated with 10 micrograms/ml of sulfatide, these enhanced functions, characteristic of primed monocytes, returned to levels found in unprimed monocytes. (With respect to these functions and others, monocytes or macrophages primed in vitro by exposure to LPS or interferon-gamma resemble macrophages activated in vivo by infection. In vivo, activated macrophages provide non-specific resistance to infection). Inhibition of priming by sulfatide could be detected within 10 min, but maximum effect of sulfatide required 3 to 5 hr. Sulfatide had no effect on O2- release, if it was added after the cells had been stimulated by PMA, suggesting that sulfatide did not inhibit enzymes involved in formation of O2-, but rather that sulfatide inhibited priming. Increasing the amounts of LPS or interferon-gamma did not counteract the effects of sulfatide. Sulfatide did cause monocytes to release some prostaglandin E2 (less than 1 nM), but the amount was not sufficient to inhibit monocyte functions. The effect of sulfatide was not blocked by indomethacin. Other sulfated compounds and other products of mycobacteria did not produce the sulfatide effect. We conclude that M. tuberculosis has on its outer surface a chemical that directly interferes with monocyte priming. In vivo, M. tuberculosis might use sulfatide to block macrophage activation and thereby resist being killed by macrophages.\r"

  ".U": "88088885\r", 
  ".W": "Two gene segments, V kappa-25-39 and V kappa-25-47, that encode antibody to streptococcal group A carbohydrate in A/J mice were found to be more than 95% homologous in nucleotide sequence in both coding and noncoding regions. It was previously shown that V kappa-25-39 encodes immunoglobulins that express the IdX and IdI-1 idiotopes, whereas V kappa-25-47 encodes IdX+, and IdI-1- immunoglobulins. V kappa gene segments that were clearly allelic to V kappa-25-47 are used to encode IdX+, IdI-1- anti-group A carbohydrate antibodies by C.B20 mice and likely by C57BL/6 mice. Murine strains that are deficient in IdI-1 idiotope expression were investigated by Southern blotting with a 5' probe from V kappa-25-39. Two IdI-1-deficient strains, CE/J and C58/J, had a grossly altered V kappa gene segment structure compared with the A/J prototype. In contrast, the IdI-1-deficient strain, C57BL/6, was indistinguishable from A/J with the 5'V kappa-25-39 probe, indicating that more subtle genetic changes account for the loss of IdI-1 expression in C57BL/6 mice. The evolution of V kappa-25-39 and V kappa-25-47 gene segments was deduced by comparison with the homologous V kappa 24B gene segment of Mus pahari. V kappa-25-39 and V kappa-25-47 likely have recently duplicated once in A/J and related strains of laboratory mice and may have duplicated again in CE/J mice. Thus, individual members of the V kappa 24 gene family, to which V kappa-25-39 and V kappa-25-47 belong, are preserved while the number of gene copies expands or contracts. This fact is strong evidence that evolutionary forces have maintained the V kappa 24 gene family, all of which encode antibody specific for carbohydrate found in bacterial pathogens.\r"

  ".U": "88088886\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies had shown that several phenotypic markers expressed by several strains of mice (C58, AKR, PL, RF) involve a light chain group, called V kappa Ser, encoded by a single germ-line gene (Igk-VSera). Most other inbred strains (e.g., BALB/c) contain an allele (Igk-VSerb) which differs from Igk-VSera both in coding regions and in an upstream octamer region known to be important for transcription. Since no evidence for expression of the Igk-VSerb gene product has been observed, experiments were undertaken to determine whether the alteration in the regulatory octamer region of BALB/c might have rendered it defective for transcription. The upstream octamer-containing region of a cloned functional V kappa Ser gene expressed by the C.C58 myeloma M75 was replaced by the corresponding region from BALB/c or deleted entirely. Constructs were transfected into J558L cells and quantity of transcription and site of transcription initiation were compared. Results suggest that the BALB/c octamer (CTTTGCGT), which differs at two of eight nucleotides from the consensus octamer sequence (ATTTGCAT), is fully functional in transcription initiation. This is consistent with results of S1 nuclease protection experiments which indicate the presence of small amounts of correctly initiated V kappa Ser-related RNA in BALB/c spleen.\r"

  ".U": "88088966\r", 
  ".W": "Because keratinocytes (KCs) express HLA-DR in a wide variety of skin diseases in which mononuclear leukocytes are observed in close apposition to KCs (i.e., graft-versus-host disease), and since gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) induces HLA-DR expression on KCs, we asked whether IFN-gamma treatment of KCs would influence the adherence of mononuclear leukocytes. When allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) and a Leu-3+ T cell clone were coincubated with IFN-gamma-treated KCs (300 U/ml, 3 days), there was a marked increase in binding compared with nontreated KCs. Similar binding results were obtained using a cutaneous squamous carcinoma cell line (SCL-1) after IFN-gamma treatment. The IFN effect was relatively specific for IFN-gamma, as neither IFN-alpha nor -beta had any effect. Tumor necrosis factor exposure (500 U/ml, 3 days) increased the binding of the Leu-3+ T cell clone to both KCs and SCL-1 cells. Neutrophils displayed a less marked (but statistically significant) increase in binding to IFN-gamma-treated KCs. Using the Leu-3+ cell clone and SCL-1 cells, detailed kinetic analysis of the effect of IFN-gamma on binding was performed. The increased adherence between the cells began to appear after only 7 hours of treatment with r-IFN-gamma (300 U/ml) and reached a plateau at 48 hours, with significantly enhanced binding continuing for at least 48 hours after removal of IFN-gamma. The mechanism of binding was explored by preincubation of the PBML/Leu-3+ T cells with anti-LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen) antibody (0.6-6.0 micrograms/ml), which totally inhibited the binding with no effect by anti-LFA-2 or -3 or class I or II antibodies despite documented binding of these antibodies to the cells. These results suggest that, after exposure to IFN-gamma, the ability of KCs to bind mononuclear leukocytes is strongly enhanced, and this adherence may be important in leukocyte trafficking in the skin as well as contributing to altered KC-leukocyte interaction, which may be of fundamental importance in a variety of skin disease.\r"

Lymphocytes from all 13 cutaneous T cell lymphoma patients contained DNA with clonal rearrangements of the beta chain gene of the T cell receptor. In addition, DNA from 4 patients contained an immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. T cell enrichment studies of peripheral blood lymphocytes from 2 patients confirmed that the immunoglobulin gene joining region rearrangement was confined to the T cell population. These results demonstrate that cutaneous T cell lymphoma is a clonal T cell malignancy that frequently expresses a dual genotype. A multiparameter approach, including DNA probes for the beta chain of the T cell receptor, as well as the immunoglobulin genes, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetics, is valuable in the diagnosis of cutaneous T cell lymphoma.\r"

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the antibody was highly protective for infectious disease when used prophylactically in three animal models.

With few exceptions the in vivo PAE correlated well with the PAE reported in prior in vitro studies. Residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the PAE.

  ".W": "An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the measurement of human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) in plasma and serum. Microtiter plates were coated with a monoclonal antibody and incubated with standard or sample. Bound u-PA was quantitated with polyclonal antibodies conjugated with biotin, followed by avidin-peroxidase. The assay was 10 times as sensitive as previously reported immunoassays, the detection limit being approximately 1 pg u-PA in a volume of 100 microliter, with a linear dose-response up to 15 pg u-PA. The assay detected active u-PA and its inactive proenzyme form equally well, and the recovery of both forms was higher than 90% in plasma. It also detected u-PA complexed with plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. Various structurally related proteins, including t-PA, were tested, but no reaction was observed with proteins other than u-PA and its amino-terminal fragment. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation for determination of u-PA in plasma were 7.6% and 8.4%, respectively. The ELISA was used to measure the concentration of u-PA in plasma from 34 healthy donors and 92 patients with breast cancer with a varying extent of disease. The mean value for the healthy donors was 1.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml (SD) of u-PA in plasma. This value is substantially lower than those previously reported. The mean value for the patients with breast cancer was 1.3 +/- 0.4 ng/ml. This moderate increase was statistically significant at the 1% level. Approximately one quarter of the patients had plasma u-PA concentrations above the range observed for the healthy controls. There was a positive correlation between the mean u-PA plasma concentration and the extent of disease in different groups of patients.\r"

On alternative days she was active, outgoing, energetic, and cheerful. Her past history was marked by mild postpartum depressions, not requiring treatment, with each of her six pregnancies, and a more severe depression at age 57, which seemed to respond to Premarin. During the recent 2-year period of mood swings, the patient was given trials of several heterocyclic antidepressant medications, but side effects precluded the use of therapeutic doses or durations of treatment. Reluctantly, the patient agreed to a trial of lithium carbonate. After the second week of lithium treatment, at a level of 0.4 mEq/ml, she reported marked improvement, feeling fine every day without mood fluctuations. After almost 1 year at this blood level, she remains asymptomatic. Thus, the patient's cyclic 48-hour unipolar depression responded dramatically and completely to low doses of lithium carbonate.\r"

These findings suggest that partical CCO deficiency may be present in the skeletal muscles of the patient. NADH cytochrome c reductase in the patient's muscle mitochondria was low compared with normal controls (about 26%), although succinate cytochrome c reductase was normal. Coenzyme Q10 administration (90 mg/day) did not improve CSF lactate levels, but did decrease plasma lactate levels. His muscle weakness slightly improved.\r"

  ".W": "Calorie and protein supplementation improves nutritional status. This support may improve outcome and decrease morbidity and mortality in acutely brain-injured patients. Investigators have observed a poor tolerance to enteral feedings after brain injury and have noted that this persists for approximately 14 days postinjury. This delay has been attributed to increased gastric residuals, prolonged paralytic ileus, abdominal distention, aspiration pneumonitis, and diarrhea. In the present investigation, 23 brain-injured patients with an admission 24-hour peak Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score between 4 and 10 were studied for 18 days from hospital admission. The mean duration from injury to initiation of full-strength, full-rate enteral feeding was 11.5 days. Seven of the 23 patients tolerated enteral feedings within the first 7 days following hospital admission (mean 4.3 days), four patients tolerated feedings between 7 and 10 days postadmission (mean 9 days), and 12 patients did not tolerate feedings until after 10 days postinjury (mean 15.9 days). There was a marginally significant relationship between low GCS scores on admission and length of days to enteral feeding tolerance (p = 0.07). A significant inverse relationship was observed between daily peak intracranial pressure (ICP) and time to tolerance of feedings (p = 0.02). There was no significant relationship between feeding tolerance and days to return of bowel sounds (p = 0.12). Serum albumin levels decreased during the investigation (mean +/- standard error to the mean: 3.2 +/- 0.12 gm/dl on Day 1; 2.7 +/- 0.23 gm/dl on Day 16; normal = 3.5 to 5.0 gm/dl), whereas the percentage of patients tolerating feedings increased over the course of the study. The authors conclude that patients with acute severe brain injury do not adequately tolerate feedings via the enteral route in the early postinjury period. Tolerance of enteral feeding is inversely related to increased ICP and severity of brain injury. It is suggested that parenteral nutritional support is required following brain injury until enteral nutrition can be tolerated.\r"

Fecal samples were obtained from paired rats over a 3-d period, were analyzed for neutral and acidic steroid levels and compositions and, together with the food, were assayed for divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+ and Zn2+). Animals in all groups were in balance for divalent cations, and there appeared to be no relationship between the extent of cation balance and the type of fiber fed. All insoluble fiber diets and the guar gum and psyllium diets resulted in significantly higher daily fecal mass and, in general, resulted in significant dilution of total fecal steroids. With the insoluble fibers, there was a general dilution of fecal neutral steroids, which was not apparent with the soluble fibers or cholestyramine. In addition, except for the pectin- and mixed fiber-containing diets, there was reduced bacterial conversion of the primary bile acids to secondary bile acids or metabolites.\r"

Results indicate that plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels tend to be lower with EFAD, whereas plasma levels of apolipoproteins E and B are lower and apo A-I levels are higher in EFAD animals. EFAD was also associated with 30% fewer apo E--enriched HDL1 particles and a decrease from 11.4 to 11.1 nm in the mean peak diameter of HDL (P less than 0.05). These observations emphasize the sensitivity of apo E content to alterations in plasma cholesterol level and suggest that cholesterol transport is decreased during EFAD in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a basal AIN-76 diet containing 80, 200, 350, 500 or 650 mg of magnesium per kilogram of diet for 6 wk. Ventricular slices, as well as microsomal fractions, were prepared from the hearts and were used to determine sodium-potassium pump activity. Sodium-potassium pump activity was assessed in the microsomal membranes by determining the ouabain-inhibitable Na+, K+-ATPase activity and [3H]ouabain binding, and in the ventricular slices, by determining ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake under K+-free conditions. The ATPase activity increased with increasing dietary magnesium, so that in the hearts of those animals that were fed 500 and 650 mg of magnesium/kg diet, it was significantly greater than the activity in the hearts of the animals fed 80 and 200 mg/kg diet. Similarly, 86Rb uptake by heart slices from rats fed 500 and 650 mg of magnesium/kg diet was significantly greater than the uptake by heart slices from animals fed 80 and 200 mg/kg diet. [3H]Ouabain binding did not change with increasing dietary magnesium. Thus, magnesium deficiency appears to have no effect on the number of sodium-potassium pump sites, but does decrease the activity of the pump. It is suggested that this leads to an increase in intracellular Na+, resulting in a change in the membrane potential, and may contribute to the arrhythmias associated with magnesium deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Rats fed a restricted amount (60% of ad libitum intake) of a well-balanced diet (protein energy:total energy ratio of 0.20) had a reduced growth rate but maintained near-normal plasma albumin concentrations. However, when such animals were infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (a hookwormlike intestinal parasite), plasma albumin values fell precipitously, from a preinfection value of 34.7 g/L to 21.3 g/L on d 10 postinfection (p.i.). The hypoalbuminemia developed rapidly, without changes in body weight and despite an adequate amount of dietary protein. Similarly infected well-nourished animals showed a much less severe effect, plasma albumin values falling from 34.8 to only 31.3 g/L by d 10 p.i. Two measurements of gastrointestinal integrity, [51Cr]albumin leakage from the plasma and intestinal permeability to mono- and disaccharide sugars, suggested that the alterations in plasma albumin values could be explained on the basis of protein leakage into the gastrointestinal tract through parasite-induced lesions. Much greater changes in the indices of mucosal integrity were observed in the undernourished animals and overall it was clear that the energy-restricted animals had been far more severely affected by the parasite than their well-fed counterparts. The results are discussed with reference to the etiology of kwashiorkor in humans.\r"

The concentrations of free lysine in the plasma were measured after feeding control and browned protein diets supplemented with graded levels of lysine. Bioavailability of lysine was estimated based on the amounts of supplemental lysine in the diets that resulted in rapid increases in plasma lysine. An approximately 80% loss in bioavailable lysine content was determined by this method in a fish protein isolate subjected to the Maillard browning reaction under mild conditions (40 d incubation at 37 degrees C). The nutritional damage to lysine determined by plasma lysine response was similar to that estimated in vitro by enzymatic hydrolysis and fluorodinitrobenzene reagent, but was underestimated by acid hydrolysis and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid reagent. Rainbow trout are similar to other animals in their inability to utilize the deoxyketosyl (Amadori) compound of lysine formed in early Maillard reaction, and in their plasma response to dietary levels of essential amino acids.\r"

After 8 wk, plasma retinol levels were lower in low protein (LP) and growth-restricted (GR) groups than in ad libitum controls (P less than 0.05); however, ocular vitamin A concentration remained normal. Plasma taurine concentration was lower only in the LP group, while retinal taurine was lower in both LP and GR groups than in control groups. The dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) became abnormal (e.g., depressed a and b waves, P less than 0.05) in both LP and GR groups but was corrected by ad libitum feeding of the control diet for an additional 8 wk. In a second study, weanling LP rats were supplemented with 0.4% taurine, 0.4% methionine or 0.4% glycine. Although taurine supplementation maintained plasma and retinal taurine stores, ERGs remained abnormal with retinal sensitivity significantly lower than in unsupplemented LP rats. Thus, PEM produced abnormal ERGs independent of ocular vitamin A concentration and retinal taurine levels. The high dietary taurine fed to protein-malnourished rats caused further impairment of visual function but was not detrimental to control or pair-fed rats.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of heparin dose and infusion rate on plasma lipids, lipases, and unbound bilirubin was investigated in 22 premature infants with physiologic jaundice. Infants were randomly assigned to receive low or high intravenous doses (24 vs 137.3 U/day) of heparin. Each patient then received 2 g/kg/day of 10% Intralipid on 2 successive days: one day during a 15-hour period and the other day over 24 hours, with the order assigned randomly. The results demonstrate a significantly greater change in serum-free fatty acids in infants receiving the high heparin dose during the 15-hour lipid infusion period. Lipoprotein lipase activity rose more with the high heparin dose and equally at either infusion rate. We conclude that lipid infusions of 2 g/kg/day with low heparin dosage infused over 24 hours resulted in less elevation in serum-free fatty acids. There were no adverse effects on unbound bilirubin at either infusion rate or heparin dosage.\r"

In unlesioned rats, chronic haloperidol treatment (15 days) resulted in an increase in D2-dopamine receptor density, as measured with [3H]spiperone, in the nucleus accumbens and in the caudate-putamen. Rats treated as adults with 6-OHDA responded to chronic haloperidol similarly to controls. However, adult rats treated with 6-OHDA as neonates did not exhibit an increase in [3H]spiperone binding in response to chronic haloperidol treatment. Control and adult 6-OHDA-treated rats given haloperidol exhibited a profound akinesia. In contrast, rats that received 6-OHDA as neonates and were tested as adults did not display a significant behavioral response to haloperidol at doses as high as 2 mg/kg. Results similar to those for haloperidol were also found for SCH-23390. Chronic treatment (15 days) with this D1-dopamine antagonist increased [3H]SCH-23390 binding in the nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen in unlesioned rats as well as in adult 6-OHDA-treated rats. However, after neonatal 6-OHDA treatment, an elevation in [3H]SCH-23390 binding did not occur after chronic SCH-23390 treatment. SCH-23390 produced akinesia similar to that produced by haloperidol in unlesioned and in adult 6-OHDA-treated rats. In contrast, rats lesioned with 6-OHDA as neonates and tested as adults did not exhibit a significant behavioral response to SCH-23390 under our test conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Vasodilation mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) has been demonstrated in large conduit arteries in vitro. In the present study we investigated whether the EDRF mechanism is also present in resistance arteries of a peripheral vascular bed, namely the hindlimb of the rabbit. The right femoral artery of anesthetized rabbits was cannulated and blood was supplied through a shunt from the carotid artery. Femoral arterial blood flow and pressure were measured in the shunt. Systemic pressure was measured in the abdominal aorta. The hemodynamic effects of endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators (infused into the shunt) were measured before and after treatment of the vascular bed with gossypol or p-bromophenacyl bromide (p-BPB). Gossypol, a polyphenolic antioxidant, is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of the EDRF-mediated vasodilation in isolated arteries; p-BPB is an alkylating agent and also produces irreversible inhibition of endothelium-mediated relaxations in vitro. During inhibitor treatment the hindlimb was temporarily isolated from the blood circulation and perfused with a cell-free medium; the venous effluent was drained off so that only minimal amounts of inhibitor reached the systemic circulation. The endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine (ACh) and substance P, and the endothelium-independent vasodilators prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) induced concentration-dependent increases in femoral arterial flow (and decreases in vascular resistance). Gossypol treatment had no direct effect on systemic blood pressure or femoral arterial flow. However, after gossypol, the effects of ACh and substance P on vascular resistance were almost abolished, but there was no significant effect on the responses to PGE1 and GTN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Locomotor activity in mice and rats was considered as an index to the activity of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons. Acetorphan injected i.v. induced an increase in locomotion, mice and rats presenting a similar behavioral response. Naloxone, at low doses, blocked the enhanced motor response. The increased locomotion was antagonized by a pretreatment with haloperidol or potentiated by GBR 12783, a potent and specific inhibitor of dopamine (DA) uptake. The neurotoxic lesion of the mesolimbic DA system with 6-hydroxydopamine abolished the effect of acetorphan. These data suggest that the locomotor hyperactivity induced by the enkephalinase inhibitor results from the protection of local endogenous enkephalins and may be mesolimbic DA-dependent.\r"

Binding of ICYP was shown by differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient purification as well as digitonin treatment to be directly related to the content of arterial muscle plasma membrane assessed by marker enzymes. The Kd values obtained were all in the range of 10 to 30 pM but maximum binding site (Bmax) values varied depending upon the extent of contamination by nonplasmalemmal membranes. The more purified plasma membrane fractions have Bmax many times higher than those reported in the literature. Although purified membrane fractions all had ICYP binding characterized by a single binding site with similar Kd values, binding to some crude fractions was complex. In addition, plasma membranes for mesenteric nerves, removed carefully by dissection in our study, were shown to contain ICYP binding sites with a similar Kd and Bmax values to those in arterial muscle membrane. Using arterial muscle purified membranes after removal of nerves by dissection, Bmax values from mesenteric arteries were demonstrated to be much larger than those from aorta in both species. Although the necessity of purifying the membranes depends on the objectives of a given experiment, our result strongly suggest that measurement of changes in receptor densities requires an analytical approach which provides plasma membrane-enriched fractions derived from a single cell type and purified to a known and comparable degree, especially when changes in density related to experimental or disease processes are being investigated.\r"

Head-twitch and wet-dog shake induced by p-chloroamphetamine, a 5-HT releaser, and head-twitch induced by PCP were blocked completely by pretreatment with ritanserin, a specific 5-HT2 receptor blocker, but other behaviors induced by p-chloroamphetamine, PCP and 5-MeODMT, a 5-HT agonist, were not. The intensity of head-weaving, turning, backpedalling and hind-limb abduction induced by 5-MeODMT and the intensity of head-weaving, turning and head-twitch induced by PCP were markedly greater in the rats 2 weeks after the 5,7-DHT, a 5-HT neurotoxin-injection. Contrarily, 5-HT-mediated behaviors induced by p-chloroamphetamine were attenuated in the 5,7-DHT-treated rats. 5,7-DHT-treatment increased the number of 5-HT1 ([3H]-5-HT), 5-HT2 ([3H]ketanserin) and PCP ([3H]PCP) binding sites in the synaptic membrane of rat brain, but decreased the brain level of 5-HT (41% of control). These results may indicate that PCP as a 5-HT2 agonist induces head-twitch via 5-HT2 receptors, and that PCP induces head-weaving and turning via 5-HT1 receptors and/or some other mechanisms in rats.\r"

  ".W": "The potential for endogenous prostaglandin production to modulate the renal vascular response to intrarenal infusions of angiotensin II (AII) was investigated in the canine kidney at varying renal perfusion pressures (RPP), using suprarenal aortic constriction to vary RPP. AII, infused to achieve increments in renal arterial plasma concentrations of 300 pg/ml, induced reductions in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when RPP was 80 mm Hg or above. When RPP was reduced to 60 mm Hg, AII decreased RBF, but GFR failed to change. The vasoconstrictor response to AII was enhanced by indomethacin (8 mg/kg) at all perfusion pressures, but was not modified by the thromboxane (Tx) A2 synthase inhibitor, UK 38,485 (1 mg/kg). In contrast, the lack of change in GFR in response to AII at a RPP of 60 mm Hg was converted to a significant reduction by both indomethacin and UK 38,485. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of AII on RBF is attenuated by renal release of vasodilator prostaglandins at all RPP. However, at low RPP, AII infusion also induces the release a factor that increases GFR. As this response can be prevented by both TxA2 synthase and cyclooxygenase inhibition, it is possible that this factor is TxA2.\r"

Despite widespread use, few definitive conclusions have emerged about the sources of Pb mobilized by Ca disodium EDTA. Furthermore, the possibility that mobilized Pb may be redistributed has been suggested. The current studies indicate that the standard therapeutic protocol for Ca disodium EDTA has little impact on critical organs such as brain and liver and moreover, that diagnostic Ca disodium EDTA chelation may even increase the concentration of Pb in these tissues. After a 3 to 4 month exposure to Pb acetate in drinking water, different groups of rats received daily i.p. injections of saline (control), 75 or 150 mg/kg of Ca disodium EDTA for either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days and were then sacrificed 24 hr after the final injection. Tissue analyses indicated that Pb was mobilized from bone and kidney and redistributed initially to both brain and liver. Levels in both brain and liver declined with subsequent Ca disodium EDTA injections, but no net loss from either tissue occurred over the 5-day treatment period despite a decline in blood Pb levels and a marked enhancement of urinary Pb excretion. These findings stress the need for further investigation of Ca disodium EDTAs effects and for parallel evaluation of alternate chelating agents, and suggest that a re-evaluation of both the diagnostic and therapeutic roles of Ca disodium EDTA may be advisable.\r"

Although the precise mechanism of action for these biological activities is not known, it has been established that ANPs can bind to specific membrane receptors and can cause an increase in intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels. In previously published studies we have probed the mechanism of action of ANP and have shown that one consequence of ANP receptor-mediated increases in cGMP in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is stimulation of Na/K/Cl cotransport. Although others have suggested that ANPs may affect Na/H exchange and/or Na/K adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity in various cells and tissues, the effect of ANPs on these other Na transport systems in VSMC is not known. Furthermore, the biological relevance of ANP-stimulation of Na/K/Cl cotransport in VSMC has not been established. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether ANPs selectively stimulate Na/K/Cl cotransport in VSMC and to determine whether effects on cotransport parallel biological activity. We tested the effect of six ANPs on Na/K/Cl cotransport, and of one ANP on Na/H exchange and on Na/K ATPase activity. It was found that ANPs stimulated Na/K/Cl cotransport but had no effect on Na/H exchange or on Na/K ATPase activity in VSMC. Biological activity of the ANPs was assayed by measuring the potencies for producing vasorelaxation of aortic rings and for stimulating an increase in intracellular cGMP in VSMC. The rank orders observed for the two biological activities agreed with the rank order for stimulation of Na/K/Cl cotransport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We used the kinetics of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and fractional lithium excretion to test the hypothesis that ANP-induced natriuresis is related directly to the ANP perfusate concentration and is mediated by a decrease in proximal tubular sodium reabsorption. Wistar rat kidneys were perfused for 90 min after administration of 1 microgram of human ANP. Comparisons were made to control perfusions. ANP had a short half-life (12.4 min) and a renal clearance 6-fold greater than the creatinine clearance. ANP treatment resulted in a significant peak increase in sodium (5.6-fold), lithium (2.1-fold), potassium (2.3-fold) and water (5.1-fold) excretion. The natriuretic response to ANP was delayed 25 min. Exogenous creatinine clearance, perfusion pressure, perfusion flow and renal vascular resistance were not affected. We conclude that the kidney eliminates ANP rapidly by mechanisms that appear to be located primarily in the peritubular circulation. The initial renal response to ANP did not follow perfusate concentrations. Rather, natriuresis increased as ANP concentrations decreased. The relationship was defined by a counterclockwise hysteresis loop. Natriuresis was not mediated by an increased delivery of sodium to the tubule, but may have been due to either a direct or an indirect action of ANP on the kidney.\r"

In the AMPH experiment, the anorectics diethylpropion, mazindol, phendimetrazine, phenmetrazine and phentermine completely substituted for the training dose of AMPH. The atypical antidepressant bupropion and the psychomotor stimulant methylphenidate also completely substituted for AMPH. Other anorectics including benzphetamine, clortermine, fenetylline, mefenorex and the psychomotor stimulant pemoline that share some pharmacological properties with AMPH substituted for AMPH in some, but not all, of the monkeys tested. The anorectics fenfluramine and chlorphentermine failed to substitute for AMPH. Drugs from other pharmacological classes such as morphine, diazepam, nortripyline and PENTO also failed to substitute for AMPH, indicating pharmacological specificity. In the PENTO experiment, the benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, diazepam, flurazepam, halazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, oxazepam, temazepam and triazolam and the sedatives methaqualone and phenobarbital completely substituted for the training dose of PENTO. The nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic CL 218,872 only partially substituted for PENTO. In addition, morphine and AMPH failed to substitute for PENTO, indicating pharmacological specificity. In summary, drugs delivered intragastrically functioned as discriminative stimuli in a drug-class specific manner. The ability to use drugs delivered by this route as discriminative stimuli provides a way to compare anorectic drugs to AMPH or sedative drugs to PENTO under conditions that resemble the mode of human consumption to determine whether these drugs are likely to be associated with AMPH-like or PENTO-like drug dependence.\r"

  ".W": "Sympathetic nerve activity has been hypothesized to set the timing of cellular maturational events in target tissues. In the current study, this hypothesis was tested by lesioning catecholamine pathways in the periphery and central nervous system through the use of subcutaneous or intracisternal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine. Systemically administered 6-hydroxydopamine completely depleted peripheral norepinephrine. The central treatment completely ablated the developmental rise in brain norepinephrine and dopamine and had little effect on peripheral norepinephrine levels, but has been shown to reduce sympathetic tone. In both the heart and the kidney, either type of lesion resulted in deficits in cell acquisition (DNA) with some evidence of compensatory increases in other macromolecules involved in cell enlargement (particularly RNA), thus maintaining the tissue growth rate at only slightly subnormal levels. The peak effect was always seen during the stages at which sympathetic neuronal synaptogenesis and impulse activity ordinarily undergo their most rapid development. Most of the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced differences in nucleic acids lessened or disappeared toward weaning, and thus these data support the view that sympathetic neuronal input influences the timing of maturational control of macromolecules, but not their final set-point. In combination with earlier studies showing termination of DNA synthesis caused by exposure of heart and kidney acutely to high levels of catecholamines, the results suggest that neuronal activity provides a biphasic signal, with positive trophic effects predominating during early development when sympathetic tone is low, and negative effects appearing when sympathetic tone is elevated during the late preweanling stage.\r"

After excision, femoral arteries were cut into rings and suspended for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. Rings from the 17 beta-estradiol-treated rabbits showed an enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (3 x 10(-9)-3 x 10(-8) M) in the absence or presence of indomethacin. Under the same experimental conditions, the endothelium-dependent responses to the calcium ionophore A23187 were unchanged. In the absence of indomethacin, the response to adenosine diphosphate was depressed in rings with endothelium taken from animals treated with with 17 beta-estradiol; in the presence of the inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, the endothelium-dependent responses were comparable in blood vessels from treated and untreated rabbits. This study suggests that endothelium-dependent responses of arteries can be modulated by steroid hormones.\r"

  ".W": "The addition of prostaglandin (PG) H2 produced a transient contraction followed by a relaxation in helical strips of dog cerebral arteries partially contracted with PGF2 alpha or K+. The contraction was abolished by removal of endothelium, and the relaxation was potentiated. Relaxation induced by PGI2 was not influenced by endothelium denudation. The PGH2-induced contraction in strips with intact endothelium was not influenced by OKY-046, a thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibitor, but was abolished by treatment with ONO3708, an antagonist of vasoconstrictor PGs, whereas the relaxation was inhibited by tranylcypromine or diphloretin phosphate, a nonselective PG antagonist. Contraction induced by arachidonic acid (AA) was reversed to relaxation by removal of endothelium or treatment with ONO3708. Treatment with indomethacin attenuated the AA-induced contraction in the intact strips and also the relaxation in the strips treated with ONO3708 or denuded of endothelium. It may be concluded that vasoconstrictor PGs are synthesized from PGH2 or AA mainly in endothelium, and the production of PGI2 from PGH2 is not dependent on endothelium. Thromboxane A2 in concentrations sufficient to elicit significant contractions does not appear to be liberated from the cerebroarterial wall stimulated by PGH2.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that biotransformation of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is involved in GTN-induced relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. The temporal relationship between GTN biotransformation, elevation of cyclic GMP content and vasodilation in rabbit aortic strips (RAS) was determined. Isolated RAS were contracted submaximally with phenylephrine, and then were incubated with 0.62 microM [3H]GTN in a 30-sec time course study. GTN-induced relaxation (inhibition of phenylephrine-induced tone) of RAS was monitored; tissue cyclic GMP content was measured by radioimmunoassay; and GTN, glyceryl-1,2-dinitrate (1,2-GDN) and glyceryl-1,3-dinitrate (1,3-GDN) concentrations in RAS were measured by thin-layer chromatography and liquid scintillation spectrometry. There was time-dependent biotransformation of GTN to GDN by the RAS and a time-dependent increase in cyclic GMP content in the RAS. Statistically significant (P less than .05) biotransformation of GTN and elevation of cyclic GMP content in the tissue occurred at 10 sec, whereas the onset of GTN-induced relaxation of RAS occurred at 12 sec. During the tissue biotransformation of GTN, there was preferential formation of 1,2-GDN compared with 1,3-GDN, with 1,2-GDN/1,3-GDN ratio of 3.0/1 at 10 sec, 5.3/1 at 20 sec and 5.8/1 at 30 sec. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that GTN is a prodrug, such that biotransformation to an active metabolite is involved in GTN-induced relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. The data also indicate that the mechanisms of GTN biotransformation and GTN-induced activation of guanylate cyclase may be related intimately.\r"

  ".W": "Radioligand binding studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that specific receptor sites for glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) exist in vascular smooth muscle. The radioligand, [3H]GTN (9.98 Ci/mmol), was incubated with whole homogenate or subcellular fractions (10,000 X g pellet, 100,000 X g pellet and 100,000 X g supernatant) of bovine pulmonary vein (BPV) at 4 degrees C, 37 degrees C or room temperature. After incubation for 5, 15, 30 or 60 min, unbound and bound ligand were estimated by physical separation and liquid scintillation spectrometry. Separation of bound from free ligand was accomplished by vacuum filtration, centrifugation, equilibrium dialysis, gel filtration or precipitation. No evidence of specific binding of [3H]GTN to BPV whole homogenate or any subcellular fraction was observed. The viability of the BPV preparations was verified by demonstrating specific binding of [3H]nitrendipine to the 100,000 X g pellet. To ensure that the ligand was present throughout the incubation procedure in sufficient concentration to detect specific binding, the ability of BPV whole homogenate and subcellular fractions to biotransform GTN to glyceryl dinitrate was measured. After 60-min incubation at 37 degrees C, greater than 95% of the GTN added was unaltered; at 90 min, more than 83% of the radioactivity was associated with GTN. Our data are interpreted as not supporting the concept of a GTN receptor in BPV.\r"

We found that the thiol protease inhibitor, E-64 (L-transepoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-[4-guanidino]butane) stimulated both cellular processes. The stimulatory effect of E-64 on the polarization response of cells to wounding required a preincubation period of at least 1 hr, calcium-calmodulin interaction, protein kinase C activation, and was blocked by cyclic AMP analogs. The chemokinetic action of E-64 appears to be unique among the protease inhibitors tested and may represent a novel role for this cysteine protease inhibitor or its endogenous counterpart in the modulation of cell locomotion.\r"

  ".U": "88090614\r", 
  ".W": "Nalbuphine is a potent agonist/antagonist analgesic with a low side effect profile and low abuse potential. Previous studies have shown that nalbuphine produces predominantly agonist (analgesic) effects at kappa receptors and antagonist (morphine-reversal) effects at mu receptors in vivo. The present study was designed to localize the sites of nalbuphine binding to mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) using in vitro labeling light microscopic autoradiography. Mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors were labeled selectively using [3H]dihydromorphine, D-[3H]Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin and (-)-[3H]ethylketocyclazocine, respectively. In displacement studies in rat brain homogenates, nalbuphine had the highest affinity (Ki) for mu receptors (0.5 nM) with progressively lower affinities for kappa (29 nM) and delta (60 nM) opioid receptors. In autoradiographic studies in slide-mounted sections of guinea pig brain and monkey spinal cord, nalbuphine (300 nM) displaced completely the binding at mu and kappa receptors without significantly altering the binding at delta receptors. The binding of [3H]nalbuphine in slide-mounted sections of guinea pig forebrain was saturable and showed a curvilinear profile indicating the presence of two binding sites with apparent dissociation constant (Kd) values of 0.5 and 12 nM. Morphine and U-50,488H, which have high affinities for mu and kappa opioid receptors, respectively, inhibited [3H]nalbuphine binding with IC50 values of 0.9 and 10 nM, respectively. In saturation studies, morphine (50 nM) and U-50,488H (100 nM) selectively blocked the high and low affinity components of [3H]nalbuphine binding, respectively. The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]nalbuphine binding sites in the CNS corresponds well to the distribution of mu and kappa opioid receptors. In addition, CNS areas (deep layers of the cerebral cortex, laminae I and II of the spinal cord, substantia gelatinosa of the trigeminal nerve, periaqueductal gray and thalamic nuclei) that mediate analgesia contain high concentrations of [3H]nalbuphine binding sites. In summary, these data demonstrate that nalbuphine acts on mu and kappa opioid receptors and identify anatomical loci in the CNS in which nalbuphine may produce its actions.\r"

In these studies, exposure to Ro15-1788 resulted in the persistent reversal of GABAergic subsensitivity and restoration of anticonvulsant actions of diazepam despite the continued presence of diazepam in the rats. Reversal of tolerance appears to persist for up to 7 days after a single exposure to benzodiazepine antagonists.\r"

The proportion of collagen was increased in aneurysmal aorta from 62% to 84% and appears to be the result of preferential elastin degradation. The ratio of type I to type III collagen, estimated from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of specific cyanogenbromide peptides, did not vary significantly from 2:1 in any of the three groups of aortas. There was no evidence of increased collagenase activity in unruptured aneurysmal aorta. Collagenase activity was increased in ruptured aneurysmal aorta but could only be satisfactorily measured after resolution from the endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. We suggest that only limited collagen turnover occurs in the media of abdominal aortic aneurysms before rupture. A subgroup of three patients with a significant family history of aneurysm had lower amounts of type III collagen in the aortic media, suggesting that abnormalities in type III collagen may be one of the genetic factors contributing to familial clustering of aneurysms.\r"

The diagnosis of DIC was made on the basis of standard coagulation studies. Indium 111-labeled platelet scintigraphy demonstrated an increased accumulation of radioactivity over the aneurysm. After preoperative control of the bleeding tendency was obtained by continuous intravenous infusion of gabexate mesilate (FOY), the aneurysm was successfully replaced with a prosthetic graft. Gabexate mesilate therapy is useful for DIC as is heparin therapy. If surgical intervention is required for an abdominal aortic aneurysm with concomitant DIC, preoperative control of bleeding with gabexate mesilate or heparin is recommended to lessen operative bleeding.\r"

When considering direct and indirect costs, routine screening and immunization would be cost-effective at a prevalence of 0.06%, significantly lower than the national prevalence of 0.2%. At an annual national birth rate of 3.5 million births, a national policy of routine screening of all pregnant women would result in an annual net savings of more than $105 million. In the high-risk groups, as many as 140 cases of acute neonatal hepatitis and as many as 1400 cases of chronic liver disease would be prevented yearly per 100,000 pregnant women screened, at a net annual savings of as much as $765 million.\r"

Only 73% of the patients had detectable IgG, IgM antibodies, or both, to one or more of four phospholipids. Of these patients, 29% had IgG-type antibodies only, 56% had both IgG and IgM antibodies, and 15% had IgM antibodies only. Of the 100 patients, 19% had a history of thrombosis, 8% had a history of spontaneous abortion, and 6% had a history of seizure disorder. These complications occurred in the presence (80%) and absence (20%) of detectable antiphospholipid antibodies. Drug-related antibodies were observed in 34 patients; of these, 71% had detectable anti-phospholipid antibodies and 24% had a history of thrombosis. There were ten patients with lupus anticoagulants associated with infections; none of these patients had a history of thrombosis. The results indicate that antiphospholipid antibodies are not present in all patients with lupus anticoagulants, that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with lupus anticoagulants does not increase the risk of thrombosis in these patients, and that drug-related antibodies are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Lupus anticoagulants and antiphospholipid antibodies seem to define two distinct but related patient populations, each associated with an increased risk of thrombosis.\r"

We treated a 74-year-old man who had B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and pure red cell aplasia that was refractory to cytotoxic and corticosteroid therapy with equine antithymocyte globulin and methylprednisolone sodium succinate. This therapy resulted in a durable complete remission of both the chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the pure red cell aplasia and was associated with normalization of helper/suppressor T-cell ratios in the bone marrow.

A nonspecific mass of tissue that was adherent to the device and to portions of the drive lines contained inflammatory cells, fibrinous debris, and colonies of microorganisms.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of environmental pH on the binding and cytotoxicity of the antitumor proteins neocarzinostatin (NCS) and SMANCS [copoly(styrene-maleic acid)-conjugated NCS] to cultured cells were studied by using their fluorescent-labeled derivatives (F-drugs). At 37 degrees C the binding of these drugs to HeLa cells was pH dependent: The amount of cell-bound drugs increased with an increase in the acidity of the medium. The pH-dependent change in the binding of the drugs was not as evident at 0 degree C. The cytotoxic action of these drugs was much more rapid at acidic pH compared with that at neutral or slightly alkaline pH. Furthermore, F-drugs could be utilized to probe the microenvironmental pH in Meth-A cells, in which the drug was located by the ratio of fluorescent intensities at 450 and 490 nm. The environment of the cell-bound F-drugs became acidic with incubation time at 37 degrees C but not at 0 degree C. Inasmuch as these drugs directly attack DNA, these results suggest that NCS and SMANCS are translocated across the membrane of acidic vesicles into the cytosol after endocytotic uptake. This hypothesis is also supported by the finding that NH4Cl and chloroquine protected HeLa cells against the cytotoxicity of the drugs. Data also showed that the hydrophobic polyanion conjugate SMANCS had a much greater cell binding (10 times) and more rapid internalization compared with NCS. Taken together, our results show that acidic pH of tumor tissue is preferable for effective binding and internalization into cytosol for NCS and SMANCS.\r"

  ".U": "88091734\r", 
  ".W": "Two different bispecific hybrid antibodies were generated by cell fusion of pairs of existing hybrid-myeloma cell lines. Both hybrid antibodies had similar specificity for human CD3 and mouse Thy-1 but differed in the isotypes of the immunoglobulin heavy chains. Hybrid HA2b/2b was a hybrid between a rat IgG2b (CD3) and a rat IgG2b anti-Thy-1, whereas HA2b/2c was a hybrid between the same rat IgG2b (CD3) and a rat IgG2c anti-Thy-1. Both hybrid antibodies were found to be very potent in inducing the killing of Thy-1-positive targets by human T-cell blasts, with the hetero-hybrid HA2b/2c showing a higher titer. T-cell blasts generated from resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells by a novel mitogenic antibody, YTH361, were exploited as effector cells. In addition to the CD3-dependent killing, the rat IgG2b anti-Thy-1 antibody and the hybrid antibody HA2b/2b but not the rat IgG2c anti-Thy-1 or the hybrid antibody HA2b/2c were also able to elicit antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). This ADCC was inhibited by an anti-FcRlow (CD16) monoclonal antibody, which suggests that these effectors were K-cells. Toxicity toward the T-cell blast effector population was also observed, but in this instance the hetero-hybrid HA2b/2c had a lower cytotoxic titer. In conclusion, mixed isotype hybrid antibodies may have some advantages for eliciting T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cell targets by exhibiting a better therapeutic ratio of target cell to effector cell cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Autosensitisation to IgG may be important in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and could be related to reduced glycosylation of the oligosaccharides in the C gamma 2 region of serum IgG. The activity of galactosyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyses the addition of galactose to the oligosaccharide chains, was measured in the circulating B cells of seventeen patients with classic rheumatoid arthritis. It was significantly lower than that of a group of eleven controls (p less than 0.001) or of nine age-matched controls (p less than 0.001). In contrast, the enzyme activity of the T cells was within the range of that in nine age-matched controls, and enzyme activity in monocyte-rich mononuclear-cell populations was higher than in controls, possibly reflecting stimulation of the monocytes in rheumatoid arthritis. These findings suggest that galactosyltransferase may regulate the degree of glycosylation during IgG synthesis and could therefore be implicated in the rheumatoid inflammatory process.\r"

On the third postoperative day clinical neurological deficits were observed in 46% of group A and 27% of group B, and psychometric deficits in 71% and 40%, respectively. On analysis of the records, more than half of group A proved to have been hypocapnic immediately before onset of cardiopulmonary bypass, and those with postoperative deficits differed from the others in this group in having had greater changes in PaCO2 after onset of bypass and lower cerebral perfusion pressures in the first 10 minutes of bypass, usually because of a rise in cerebral venous pressure.\r"
