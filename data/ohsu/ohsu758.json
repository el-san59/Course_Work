Continuous low dose (60 mg/kg per day) oral AZT administration for 6 weeks increased survival time by 5-6 weeks. Decreasing the duration of therapy to 3 weeks decreased the mean survival time. Extending the therapy from 6 to 14 weeks increased the median survival time (8 weeks). This dose was nontoxic and reduced virus titers, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. AZT also retarded the immune dysfunction syndrome characteristic of this model. Hypergammaglobulinemia was reduced by AZT and was also a marker for disease progression. AZT reduced hyperproliferation of large blast cells and delayed the loss of splenic B cells.\r"

Their role and function during microbial infections are largely unknown. In 10 patients with Epstein-Barr virus-induced infectious mononucleosis, the gamma delta TCR-expressing T cell population expanded during the acute phase. These cells were largely delta TCS1-, CD4-, and CD8- but expressed activation antigens such as human leukocyte antigen-DR and CD38. The convalescent phase of infectious mononucleosis was characterized by a relative persistence of gamma delta T cells. Together these data suggest a possible role of gamma delta T cells in the control of primary Epstein-Barr virus infection in humans.\r"

Mean peak serum bactericidal titers (SBT) were significantly higher for cephalexin than for dicloxacillin, ciprofloxacin, and TMP/SMZ (P less than .05). The difference between cephalexin and clindamycin did not achieve statistical significance. Dicloxacillin, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin were not statistically different from each other. Mean SBT for TMP/SMZ was less than 1:2, significantly less than that achieved by the other antibiotics. Only clindamycin achieved a trough SBT greater than 1:2. This was statistically significant compared with each of the other antibiotics.\r"

The ca reassortant was attenuated and elicited the production of systemic and local antibodies; the 50% human infectious dose was 10(6.4) TCID50. Six weeks after vaccination, 12 unvaccinated volunteers and 13 recipients of ca virus (10(7.5) TCID50) were challenged experimentally with homologous wild-type influenza B virus. The ca vaccine completely protected against illness, and the magnitude of shedding was 50-fold less in vaccinees than in unimmunized controls, five of whom became ill. These findings indicate that the six internal RNA segments of the ca influenza B/Ann Arbor/66 donor virus confer desirable properties of a live virus vaccine to a reassortant derived from a virulent virus. Such reassortants may be suitable vaccines for healthy adults.\r"

Two doses of this vaccine given 1-2 weeks apart evoked neutralizing antibody titers greater than or equal to 8 in only 77% of recipients. After three JE vaccine doses administered 1-2 weeks apart, 99% developed titers greater than or equal to 8. When a third dose was given to 29 participants 6-12 months after the primary series, all developed titers greater than or equal to 16. Reported adverse reactions included injection site tenderness (18%), erythema (6%), or swelling (3%); headache (9%); and dizziness, fatigue, sleepiness, nausea, chills, fever, or lower back pain (less than or equal to 5%). On the basis of this study, three doses of BIKEN JE vaccine are recommended for US citizens who may be at risk of exposure to JE virus.\r"

In contrast, this study showed that for a susceptible sex partner, the number of exposures to an infected index case is indeed associated with transmission, but in a nonlinear fashion. Factors that can dilute an association between transmission and number of exposures include measurement error in calculating number of exposures, use of inappropriate statistical models, and failure to account for variations in transmission rates. For example, the practice of anal intercourse and the experience of bleeding during intercourse increase the likelihood of transmission. We also observed that transmission occurred with fewer exposures among couples who did not use condoms compared with couples who did. The number of exposures also affects the independent association between other risk factors and transmission and thus should be considered when analyzing other sources of risk.\r"

In 5 of the 10 patients with concurrent rises in IgG titers to both viruses, the rise in IgG anti-HHV-6 preceded that of IgG anti-CMV. Complete removal of IgG anti-CMV reactivity from 5 sera from patients who had a primary CMV infection with a rise in IgG anti-HHV-6 titer had no effect on the IgG anti-HHV-6 titer of those sera, demonstrating that the rise in HHV-6 IgG titer was not a consequence of anti-CMV antibodies cross-reacting in the HHV-6 IgG assay.\r"

For the first 4 years of life, systemic Hib disease was significantly greater in leukemic children than in the general population (606/100,000 vs. 90/100,000, respectively). Fifty children aged 2-6 years with acute leukemia were vaccinated with a Hib conjugate vaccine, ProHibit. The overall response rate was 50%; however, 75% of children receiving leukemic therapy for less than 12 months responded versus 18% of those treated longer. After vaccination, the geometric mean antibody concentration was 7.2 micrograms/ml, appreciably lower than for normal children of similar ages. After 12 months, the geometric mean antibody concentration had declined to 0.35 micrograms/ml, and 75% of subjects had antibody levels greater than or equal to 0.15 micrograms/ml. A booster dose for unsuccessfully vaccinated subjects was of minimal benefit. Children with acute leukemia in remission who were treated according to the leukemia therapy protocol of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital had a good likelihood of responding to the conjugate Hib vaccine if administered within a year of initiation of chemotherapy.\r"

Men with a new or casual partner were more likely to have gonorrhea than men with no such partners (adjusted odds ratio = 2.7); this finding did not hold true for women. Condom use in the previous month reduced the chances of gonorrhea acquisition for both men and women. More than 33% continued to engage in sexual activity after onset of symptoms or knowledge of sexually transmitted disease exposure. Individuals with repeated episodes of gonorrhea exhibited an array of risk-taking behaviors, such as intravenous drug use and casual sex partners. These data suggest the complex nature of the behaviors and sexual contexts within which gonorrhea acquisition occurs.\r"

The rate of urinary tract infection per person-day after onset of diarrhea was significantly greater in patients with diarrhea (relative risk = 10.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-63.1, P = .006). When indwelling bladder catheter and duration of catheter placement were considered, diarrhea remained an independent risk factor for urinary tract infection in logistic regression analysis (P = .009). These data suggest that diarrhea and consequent urethral meatal contamination may be a cause of nosocomial urinary tract infection, especially in patients with a catheter, and that removal of the catheter should be considered whenever possible in patients with diarrhea.\r"

Patients were eight elderly adults with complicated medical problems and one infant with congenital jejunoileal atresia. Seven patients were hospitalized before P. acidilactici was isolated. Eight had received multiple antibiotics; however, only two had received vancomycin. In all cases there was a delay in correct bacterial identification, and the significance of the isolate was uncertain. There was no clearly identified syndrome associated with P. acidilactici bacteremia. All eight adults had fever and six had pneumonia potentially attributable to other causes. The findings underscore the importance of proper identification of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci.

  ".W": "The neurologic symptoms in human shigellosis have often been attributed to Shiga toxin, although its exact role has not been determined. By use of a [3H] thymidine-labeled HeLa cell assay, cytotoxic activity was demonstrated in stool but not cerebrospinal fluid or serum from five patients with shigellosis presenting with seizures or encephalopathy. Bacterial isolates produced 16.0-88.2 CD50 (50% cytotoxic dose) of cytotoxin/mg of protein. The toxin activity in stool and the cytotoxic activity of the isolates were not neutralized by antiserum to purified Shiga toxin. DNA hybridization studies showed that Shigella isolates from these patients lacked the structural genes for Shiga toxin. The cytotoxin produced was also distinct from Shiga-like toxins I and II. Sonicates of the Shigella strains injected intraperitoneally into mice caused lethargy and lethality. The toxin activity was heat-labile and sensitive to trypsin, indicating that its active component is protein. Ultrafiltration and gel filtration chromatography showed a molecular mass of 100-125 kDa. Thus Shiga toxin production is not essential for the development of neurologic manifestations of shigellosis; other toxic products may play a role.\r"

Paired sera from 50 patients with other respiratory infections were used as controls. The sensitivities of the assays from paired sera were 61%, 90%, and 90% and specificities were 98%, 92%, and 72%, respectively. Of the patients culture-positive for pertussis, 68% had positive levels of antibody to pertussis toxin antigen in their first serum samples, obtained at the same time as samples for culture. Infants had antibody responses to pertussis toxin antigen, in contrast to weak antibody responses measured by B. pertussis antigen. The results from this study indicate that ELISA, especially measuring pertussis toxin IgA, is a valuable additional tool for diagnosing pertussis and can be used as a complementary test with cultures.\r"

Patients were monitored daily for purulent discharge until healing. Of the 53 wounds studied, 44 (83%) had no growth or low-density superficial colonization on the blood agar (generally less than 15 colony-forming units and within the upper 1.5 cm of the catheter). None of these 44 wounds was subsequently infected; therefore, these colonies represented colonization. Of the 9 wounds (17%) that yielded greater than 15 colony-forming units and a diffuse subcutaneous pattern (colonies below the upper 1.5 cm of the catheter), all developed purulent discharge with a positive culture of the same organisms found by semiquantitative culture. This result differed significantly (P less than .01) from the 44 wounds without subsequent infection. This semiquantitative technique has the potential to distinguish infection from colonization and may be useful in diagnosing surgical wound infection.\r"

Sera from patients with the multi-parasitic/bacillary type of disease (visceral or diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis and lepromatous leprosy), known to be associated with absent or low specific T cell response, contained significantly higher TNF alpha titers than those of patients with pauci-parasitic/bacillary disease (localized cutaneous leishmaniasis and nonlepromatous leprosy).

Patients' IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE reacted strongly with An2-defined antigen at 4 or 5 weeks and at 1 or 7 days, respectively, after the onset of clinical symptoms of anisakiasis. However, sera from healthy persons did not react, even though they often ate raw fish. This indicates a high diagnostic specificity of this assay system for clinically manifested anisakiasis.\r"

Patients were alternatively divided into two groups. In the immediate group, exogenous P was supplied from the day of surgery. In the delayed group, P was supplied 4 days after the surgery, the day the fertilized ovum is supposed to arrive in the uterine cavity. Except for higher serum P levels on luteal day 3 in the immediate group, no significant differences were found in serum P levels during the early luteal phase, the pregnancy rate, and the abortion rate between the two groups. It is possible that in stimulated cycles, higher serum P levels during the early luteal phase render the endometrium receptive for embryo implantation, albeit unlock the isthmic block. It may not be crucial to start exogenous P supplementation either before or after a fertilized egg(s) arrives in the uterine cavity. The role of isthmic block in GIFT needs further evaluation.\r"

A significant increase in the penetration rate for the filtered sperm population was noted even after the sperm motility in the filtrate was adjusted with medium equal to that of the prefiltered sample. However, no significant differences in oocyte penetration were seen between the prefiltered and the filtered sperm population when the filtered sperm samples were diluted with nonviable spermatozoa. These results show that glass wool filtration yields a sperm population with a greater penetrating capacity. It was concluded that motility alone could not account for the improved penetrability and that the removal of nonviable spermatozoa may at least, in part, be responsible for this effect.\r"

We retrospectively analyzed all GIFT and SO-IUI cycles performed concurrently from January 1985 to August of 1987 at a single university center. Pregnancy rates were significantly better for GIFT than SO-IUI (P less than 0.001), with an odds ratio of 3.25 (P = 0.001). Stepwise multiple logistic regression identified factors that correlate with pregnancy: absence of endometriosis (P = 0.05), infertility less than 3 years' duration (P = 0.002), TMS greater than or equal to 30 X 10(6) (P = 0.005), and treatment with GIFT rather than SO-IUI (P = 0.001). These data give a first approximation of the increased efficacy of GIFT versus SO-IUI and provide valuable insight into significant confounding variables to be considered when planning a randomized, prospective trial to evaluate these techniques.\r"

The mares were administered progesterone in oil, 300 mg intramuscularly daily, starting 1 or 2 days after donor mare ovulation. Embryos were transferred on day 7 after donor ovulation. Mare 1 became pregnant after the first embryo transfer and had a normally developing fetus on necropsy on day 45 of gestation. Mare 3 became pregnant after the third embryo transfer, but the embryo was lost between day 14 and day 18 of gestation. Mare 2 received embryos on six occasions without maintaining pregnancy after transfer. Mares with gonadal dysgenesis treated with progesterone can establish and maintain pregnancy after embryo transfer, but there may be differences in this capability among mares, possibly related to the cause of the gonadal dysgenesis.\r"

In this study, we determined the levels of selected antioxidants in the plasma of 25 patients with ongoing ARDS and 16 healthy control subjects. We also examined these plasmas and pulmonary edema fluid of ARDS patients for lipid hydroperoxides. Both ascorbate and ubiquinol-10 concentrations in ARDS plasma were significantly lower than in normal plasma. alpha-Tocopherol concentrations, when standardized to total plasma cholesterol, were not lower in ARDS patients than in normal subjects. A pattern of antioxidant levels virtually identical to that observed in ARDS plasma was obtained after in vitro incubation of healthy plasma with stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes: very low ascorbate, decreased ubiquinol-10, and unchanged alpha-tocopherol concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides were found in pulmonary edema fluid of ARDS patients, but not in plasma, nor in the plasma of healthy individuals, when a sensitive and selective chemiluminescence assay for hydroperoxides was used. ARDS patients also showed significant decreases in plasma levels of cholesterol esters in conjunction with discoidal high-density lipoprotein profiles, indicating a decrease in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity. We conclude that ARDS is associated with oxidative stress, possibly exerted by oxidants released from activated phagocytic leukocytes, and major changes in plasma cholesterol metabolism.\r"

In this study we examined the effects of dietary fish oil in accelerated nephrotoxic serum nephritis. For 1 month, 14 female rats were fed diets that differed only in fat composition, containing either menhaden (fish) oil or beef tallow (control). Rats were then preimmunized with rabbit IgG and, 5 days later, were injected with nephrotoxic serum. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured continuously in conscious animals by means of intraperitoneal 14C-labeled inulin minipumps. Fish oil-containing diets markedly attenuated the nephrotoxic serum-induced decline in GFR and the rise in proteinuria and significantly reduced glomerular prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2. The results of tests of renal histology showed no differences between the two groups. Five days after preimmunization, rats fed fish oil had more rabbit IgG remaining in their serum and had mounted less of an antibody response to the rabbit IgG. Fish oil diets also resulted in an attenuated disappearance of injected 14C-labeled rabbit IgG. In vitro, peritoneal macrophages from rats fed fish oil took up less rabbit IgG than macrophages from rats fed control diets. Thus the beneficial effects of a fish oil diet may result from defective immune surveillance and from alterations in eicosanoids.\r"

  ".W": "The present article discusses the evaluation of surgical stress on the basis of the hepatic functional capacity of each patient. The changes in arterial blood ketone body ratio (KBR; acetoacetate/beta-hydroxybutyrate), which reflects hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, following intraoperative procedures were investigated in 60 laparotomy cases, including 30 cases with partial hepatectomy. The time course of changes in KBR was obtained by serial measurement during operation. The total area below the KBR level of 0.7 was defined as the hepatic stress score (HSS). HSS was significantly greater in the cases with hepatectomy (43.5 +/- 9.1; mean +/- SE) than in others (16.5 +/- 4.2; p less than 0.01). HSS in 13 patients accompanied by postoperative complications (60.4 +/- 17.7) was also significantly greater than that in the patients with uneventful postoperative courses (22.1 +/- 4.3; p less than 0.05). The former was also accompanied by significantly larger postoperative catabolic response preceding the clinical onset of complications (p less than 0.001). In the cases with uneventful postoperative courses, analysis of variance revealed that nitrogen balance and catabolic index in the first postoperative week were dependent on HSS negatively and positively, respectively (p less than 0.005), indicating a causative relationship between the suppression of hepatic energy metabolism during operation and the enhanced postoperative catabolic response. These results suggest that total surgical stress in major laparotomy can be quantitated and evaluated through the magnitude of decrease in hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, and that this evaluation may provide valuable information for intraoperative and postoperative patient care.\r"

Three-week-old male C3H/HeN mice were divided into four groups. Group 1 mice were infected intraperitoneally (IP) on day 0 with CB3 10(2.5) TCID50, were made to swim daily from days 1 to 9, and were immunosuppressed with daily doses of cyclosporine A (25 mg/kg IP) from days -2 to 8, plus 0.1 ml antithymocyte 1.2 IgG 2a monoclonal antibody IP on day 0. Mice in group 2 were infected and made to swim daily from days 1 to 9. Mice in group 3 were infected and immunosuppressed as outlined. Mice in group 4 were infected IP with CB3. Mortality rates during the acute phase of infection (days 1 to 9) were as follows: group 1, 4% (1/25); group 2, 52% (13/25); groups 3 and 4, 0. Overall mortality rates through day 21 were as follows: group 1, 67% (17/25); group 2, 72% (18/25); group 3, 40% (10/25); and group 4, 4% (1/25). Mean viral titers in serum were highest in the immunosuppressed groups throughout the study.

Myocardial inflammation, necrosis, and mean heart weight/body weight ratios were lower in group 1 compared with group 2 on days 6 and 9 but were maximal on day 13 in group 1. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in immunosuppressed mice on days 6 and 9; however, a rebound increase occurred on day 13.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A single band of hybridization at 2.4 kilobases appeared in blots of polyadenylated RNA derived from 24-hour hepatocyte cultures. This corresponds to the known size of factor XII-processed primary transcript (messenger RNA). Cultured hepatocytes secreted labeled factor XII when tritiated leucine was added to the medium, indicating that the hepatocytes used 3H-leucine to synthesize factor XII de novo. In these hepatocyte cultures immunoreactive factor XII levels progressively increased in 24 hours and factor XII clotting activity increased in parallel. Cycloheximide inhibited the accumulation of both immunoreactive and coagulant factor XII. Secreted factor XII from the rat hepatocytes comigrated with authentic rat plasma factor XII at 80,000 molecular weight in a Western immunoblot. These data indicate that cultured hepatocytes transcribe, synthesize, and secrete authentic factor XII.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently modified the dialysis tubing osmotic lysis and resealing method to examine the role of intracellular red blood cell (RBC) antioxidants. However, the potential effect of resealing on the RBC was not fully investigated. This study examined a number of cellular characteristics to determine the effects of physical lysis and resealing on the RBC. Following resealing, RBC exhibited normal morphology and at most only slight alterations in mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin concentration. RBC density distribution was significantly affected by resealing with increased populations of both light and dense cells, though the mean cell density was similar to that of control cells. Endogenous enzyme activities and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration were unaffected by the resealing procedure. While reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration was decreased by 15%, RBC oxidant sensitivity was found to be unaltered. Cellular deformability of the resealed RBC was 80% to 90% that of the control cells. Membrane phospholipid and fatty acyl composition of the resealed RBC were unaffected when compared with matched control samples. Membrane transport, permeability, and Ca2(+)-mediated cellular vesiculation were minimally altered by resealing. Finally, entrapment of fluorescent compounds demonstrated that greater than 95% of the resealed RBC had incorporated exogenous agents. In summary, the osmotic lysis and resealing method described resulted in only minor changes in cellular characteristics while allowing for the efficient loading of compounds to which the RBC membrane is normally impermeable. Consequently, this method provides great potential for the selective modification of erythrocyte constituents in order to further define their roles within the RBC.\r"

  ".W": "The immunomodulating capacities of dimethylglycine (DMG) were examined in a rabbit model. Female New Zealand white rabbits were immunized on day 0 and were given booster inoculations on day 9 with either killed influenza virus or Salmonella typhi vaccine. Experimental animals were force fed 20 mg/kg body weight of DMG daily beginning 14 days prior to the first inoculation and continuing throughout the experiment. Control animals were force fed daily only distilled water. Blood was obtained on day 0, day 9, and day 30. Hemagglutination inhibition assays showed a more than fourfold increase in mean antibody titer to influenza antigen in the DMG-treated animals (p = 0.0006) after the first inoculation, and a fourfold increase in mean titer after the booster inoculation (p = 0.1000). A standard agglutination test for Salmonella typhi O (somatic) and H (flagella) antigens was performed on all sera from animals receiving the typhoid vaccine. Mean antibody titers to the O antigen were significantly higher (more than threefold) after the first inoculation (p = 0.0302) and more than fivefold higher after the booster inoculation (p = 0.0047) in DMG-treated animals. Mean antibody titers to the H antigen were also higher in DMG-treated animals compared with controls after both the first and second inoculation. Lymphocyte transformation assays on cells taken from DMG-treated animals immunized with the influenza vaccine showed a tenfold increase in mean proliferative response (p = 0.0024). Lymphocytes from DMG-treated animals immunized with the typhoid vaccine showed a fourfold increase (mean values) in thymidine uptake (p = 0.0180). No toxicity or adverse effects were observed at any time during the experiment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The release of neutrophil chemotactic activity by the guinea pig alveolar macrophage (AM) is dependent on the fifth component of complement (C5) on the cell surface. Because one potent chemotactic factor released by AMs is leukotriene B4 (LTB4), we hypothesized that cell surface C5 may modulate LTB4 release. To test this hypothesis, human AMs obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 12 subjects were cultured for 4 hours in the presence of anti-C5 Fab' antibodies with stimuli. The cultures were harvested and evaluated for LTB4 by radioimmunoassay. The LTB4 levels in supernatants obtained from AMs cultured in media alone were variable (447 +/- 63 pg/ml), but the levels were increased when AMs were cultured with the stimuli-opsonized zymosan, immune complexes, or lipopolysaccharide (233%, 49%, and 114% increase, respectively, compared with macrophages cultured in media alone, p less than 0.05). Culturing the AMs with anti-C5 Fab' antibodies inhibited the release of LTB4 induced by opsonized zymosan, immune complexes, or lipopolysaccharide (78%, 41%, and 82% inhibition, respectively, p less than 0.05). Consistent with these observations, anti-C5 Fab' antibodies also decreased the neutrophil chemotactic activity of culture supernatants obtained from AMs stimulated with the same stimuli (p less than 0.001). These data suggest that AM release of LTB4 may be C5-dependent.\r"

Thirteen cases of SDE were identified with the predisposing factors being sinusitis (ten), mastoiditis (two), and otitis media (one). Based on data obtained from this review and from studies previously published in the literature, the keys to optimal outcome are rapid diagnosis, craniotomy with complete evacuation of the purulent collection followed by immediate surgical management of the otorhinological source of the SDE, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Computed tomography is nearly always diagnostic but can be equivocal and magnetic resonance imaging may become the diagnostic study of choice. Of the five patients initially treated with burr holes. None of the patients initially managed with craniotomy were worse or died, whereas of the four patients initially managed with burr holes, two were worse (25 per cent) and two died (25 per cent). Antibiotic therapy is guided by the organisms found in the empyema and the site of origin of the infection. The otolaryngologist must remain aware of the clinical features and management of SDE and work closely with his neurosurgical colleagues to provide early, decisive surgical treatment.\r"

However, of the four unsuccessful cases, two of the patients were able to autoinflate their ears. These results show that air douches pass regularly through the Eustachian tube into the tympanic cavity even in atelectatic ears, which by definition suffer from aeration deficiency, which is often considered to be secondary to 'Eustachian tube obstruction', or alternatively 'Eustachian tube dysfunction'. Thus, the ability to force air through the Eustachian tube by politzerization is of no diagnostic value as an indicator of normal or abnormal tubal patency or functioning in atelectatic ears and most probably in allied conditions.\r"

In Paget's disease of bone, the otic capsule appears resistant to involvement and this occurs with extensive disease at a late stage. In contrast, otosclerosis is a new bone formation of unknown cause that is limited to the otic capsule. In osteogenesis imperfecta, the poor formation of collagen leads to abnormally thin bony trabeculae with a poorly formed otic capsule. In osteopetrosis, the otic capsule is greatly expanded by increased globuli interossei, as a result of defective osteoclast function. When fractured the middle layer of the otic capsule does not form callus, but heals by fibrosis.\r"

The drums were subsequently kept in tissue culture and after various intervals studied by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. No complete covering of the perforation was seen, though a marked thickening and hyperplasia of the outer, keratinizing, squamous epithelium (OE) was evident. The inner, tympanal epithelium (IE) appeared swollen, containing rounded structures in the cytoplasm especially close to the contact area with the OE. Ingrowth of OE onto the tympanal side of the drum was seen particularly in the areas where the IE was sparse and completely lacking. Complete covering of a drum perforation seems to be dependent on the formation of supporting granulation tissue, probably resulting from an inflammatory reaction in the healing area.\r"

Penetrance of senorineural hearing loss was calculated after exclusion of the probands and was found not to be significantly different between each syndrome type but to show marked interfamilial variation. A bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was present more frequently than unilateral with the proportion varying between families. Certain audiometric shapes were found to recur in the syndrome but, apart from possibly one asymmetric configuration, seem to have been described also in other conditions. The degree of hearing loss was very variable within and between families. The implications for genetic counselling are discussed and the advantages of basing risk factors upon individual families rather than syndrome types emphasized.\r"

In this study of middle-aged men (n = 940) and women (n = 1484), we analysed the effect of CW/AC on blood pressure measurement variability and its interaction with age, body mass index (BMI), pulse rate and room temperature. In univariate polynomial regression, the variability (R2) in blood pressure that was explained by CW/AC was greater for women (systolic 6.3% and diastolic 5.7%) than for men (2.0% and 0.5%). In multivariate analysis the maximum variability explained independently by CW/AC was 2.7% for male and 6.7% for female systolic blood pressure, and 1.1% and 6.0% for male and female diastolic blood pressure, respectively. For systolic blood pressure this represented 10.4% of the explained variability in men and 9.3% of that in women. CW/AC is an important independent contributor to inter-individual variation in blood pressure measurement. It should therefore be taken into consideration in epidemiological studies and when medical care is being planned.\r"

Only biopsy-proven cases (n = 34) were studied further. Of the 34 patients with temporal arteritis, 13 (38%) presented with the silent or occult form. In this group the mean delay in diagnosis was 21.5 d (range 2-105) in contrast to a delay of 8.5 d (range 1-40) in the other group (P less than 0.05). Increased awareness of this presentation should lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of this potentially life-threatening disease, resulting in a shorter hospital stay and fewer technical investigations, with a considerable financial saving.\r"

In this study, data for weight and height from a representative sample (n = 14,549) of adult Swedes (16-84 years of age) were analysed. Data were obtained from the Study on Living Conditions conducted by Statistics Sweden, and body mass indices (BMI, kg m-2) were calculated from these interviews. They were then calibrated, since we had previously found that reported anthropometric measurements must be corrected so as to conform to recorded height and weight values, and we have developed equations accordingly. The overall mean BMI (+/- SE) was 24.02 +/- 0.99 kg m-2 for women and 24.56 +/- 0.88 kg m-2 for men. However, with regard to age, striking differences between the sexes were observed using this cross-sectional approach. Whereas in men there was a moderate increase in BMI with age, there was a sharp increase in women from 45-54 years onwards. If obesity is defined according to WHO recommendations (BMI for men greater than 30.0 kg m-2, and for women greater than 28.6 kg m-2), then 34.5% of all men in our sample were found to be overweight and 6.6% were found to be obese. The corresponding figures for women are 31.2% and 13.1%. Our data suggest that, on a nation-wide scale, overweight and obesity are common in men and women, but in women there is a marked increase from the menopause onward, for reasons that have yet to be clarified.\r"

By means of radioimmunoassay we measured the levels of two cytokines, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 1 beta in sera from subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus, and related the levels to the presence and severity of haematological abnormalities. The levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha were significantly higher in patients with anaemia (142 +/- 17 (SE) pg ml-1), lymphopenia (107 +/- 20 pg ml-1) or both (137 +/- 21 pg ml-1) than in individuals without anaemia (18 +/- 5 pg ml-1; P less than 0.001), without lymphopenia (16 +/- 7 pg ml-1; P less than 0.001) or without either disorder (19 +/- 7 pg ml-1; P less than 0.001). A strong negative correlation was found between tumour necrosis factor-alpha and haemoglobin values (r = -0.83, P less than 0.001) and absolute lymphocyte count (r = -0.66, P less than 0.001) in human immunodeficiency virus infection. The changes in the levels of serum interleukin 1 beta were less pronounced but followed the same general trend as the changes in tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The results show that the production of mononuclear phagocyte-derived cytokines is enhanced in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and that the levels of these factors are correlated with the presence of certain haematological abnormalities.\r"

Some authorities recommend periodic FFS screening for all such adults, whereas other authorities do not recommend screening FFS at all. There is evidence that some physicians have adopted a policy of \"selective screening\" by emphasizing screening FFS for adults with ancillary risk factors such as a personal history of colon polyps or previous colorectal cancer, or a family history of colon, female genital, or breast cancer. Results of this study of the subsite distribution of colorectal cancer show that both male sex and Oriental race are risk factors for colorectal cancer within reach of FFS, and that the risk of being male and Oriental (relative risk [RR] = 1.9) is of the same magnitude as that for other ancillary risk factors known for the general population (excluding specific rare disorders). Knowledge that sex and race are risk factors for colorectal cancer detectable by screening FFS may be important to those physicians who choose the selective screening approach. Further research is necessary to determine whether selective screening for colorectal cancer is efficacious, or whether the race and sex differences noted in this study are important in the etiology of colorectal cancer.\r"

Hypertensive adults who identified a neighborhood health center with a community-oriented primary care philosophy as their source of care were more likely to have their disease detected, treated, and controlled than were hypertensive adults who identified other sources of care. The improved control was most evident for men and for blacks, but in every race-sex stratum, hypertensive patients of the neighborhood health center were more likely to be under control. Even when controlling in logistic models for age, race, and sex, identification of the neighborhood health center was associated with better control of hypertension (beta = 0.591, P = .004). In this rural community, community-oriented primary care delivered through a neighborhood health center appears to be associated with increased likelihood of detection, treatment, and control of hypertension.\r"

Patients who stated no overall preference often expressed one in specific clinical situations, eg, anal or genital examinations. Patients who preferred female physicians reported humane behaviors as more characteristic of female physicians, and those who preferred male physicians reported humane behaviors as more characteristic of men; patients who had no overall sex preference did not sex stereotype physicians on these behaviors (F = 59.34, P less than .01). Patients who preferred male physicians reported technical competence behaviors as more characteristic of male physicians; others did not sex stereotype physicians on these behaviors (F = 15.4, P less than .01). Patients rated humaneness and comprehensiveness as being of high priority, but no relationship was found between priorities for aspects of care and preferences for sex of physician. Areas for future investigation include assessing preferences in other populations and exploring sex differences in physician behavior during office encounters and correlating these differences with patient satisfaction.\r"

The focus on needing to replace the current paper chart draws attention away from the benefits of having parts of the record stored in a computer retrieval form. Furthermore, the focus on total computerization implies a large initial and ongoing dollar commitment to replace the record completely. This commitment is unacceptable to most practices. No doubt, there are advantages of computerizing key patient data. Only key data should be computerized, however, not all data. Patient summaries containing the patient's demographics, medical problems, allergies, health maintenance status, and recent laboratory results can be used to generate needed prevention reminders as well as to do research (such as postmarketing drug surveillance) and management (such as being able to compare the utilization of various laboratory tests by physicians). Computer searches of these data can also be used to create patient target groups and to produce individualized labels and letters to contact patients. The computer medical record should complement, not replace, the traditional office record. The computer then can be used for a subset of the full record to take advantage of its unique power of retrieval and analysis. As a supplement to the record, the computer can be implemented in a modular step-by-step fashion rather than all at once with its attendant costs. This approach implies that the goal is more effective care of patients rather than a fascination with high technology.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty one patients with abnormalities of horizontal gaze were studied with magnetic imaging of the brain (MRI) and eye movement recordings to identify the loci of lesions responsible for isolated abducens palsy, conjugate gaze palsy and different types of internuclear ophthalmoplegias. The lesions responsible for a particular disorder were identified by overlapping enlarged drawings of the individual scans at comparable brain-stem levels and identifying the areas where the abnormal MRI signals intersected. A statistical procedure was devised to exclude the possibility that the areas of overlap occurred by chance. In this paper, the findings in the group of patients with VI nerve palsy are reported since the location of their lesions could be predicted from known anatomy, so validating the procedure. The results were independently obtained with the overlapping technique and the statistical procedure and showed that the lesions were located in a region corresponding to the posterior part of the abducens fasciculus. This confirms that central lesions producing isolated lateral rectus weakness spare the abducens nuclei. The agreement between the procedures used and earlier clinical and experimental results suggest that the method we describe can be applied to locate the site of lesions on MRI scans in other groups of patients with more complex gaze disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The site of lesions responsible for horizontal gaze palsy and various types of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) was established by identifying the common areas where the abnormal MRI signals from patients with a given ocular-motor disorder overlapped. Patients with unilateral gaze palsy had lesions in the paramedian area of the pons, including the abducens nucleus, the lateral part of the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis and the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis. Patients with abducens nucleus lesions showed additional clinical signs of lateral rectus weakness. Lesions responsible for bilateral gaze palsy involved the pontine tegmental raphe. Since this region contains the saccadic omnipause neurons, this finding suggests that damage to omnipause cells produces slowing of saccades rather than opsoclonus, as previously proposed. All INOs, regardless of the presence of impaired abduction or convergence, had similar MRI appearances. Frequently the lesions in patients with INO, were not confined to the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) but also involved neighbouring structures at the pontine and mid-brain levels. There was a statistically significant association between the clinical severity of the INO and the presence of abnormal abduction or convergence. The findings suggest that the lesions outside the MLF, which may affect abducens, gaze or convergence pathways, are responsible for the presence of features additional to INO, depending on the magnitude of functional disruption they produce.\r"

  ".W": "The reflex EMG responses from a tendon tap or an imposed, medium amplitude (30 degrees), stretch at a range of stretch velocities have been recorded from the triceps and biceps muscles of normal human subjects and in both the affected and \"unaffected\" arms of hemiparetic patients under relaxed conditions. In the hemiparetic arm, exaggerated tendon jerks were, as expected, observed in both muscles. The response of the biceps to elbow extension was also exaggerated compared with normal values and displayed both an additional earlier component and a much reduced velocity threshold. The triceps, in contrast, showed depressed responses to elbow flexion, with a much higher velocity threshold than normal subjects. Furthermore, on the supposedly \"unaffected\" side of the hemiparetic subjects, the reciprocal pattern was seen, with depression of the biceps response and a raising of its threshold, along with considerably exaggerated responses in the triceps including earlier components not seen in the normal subjects. The increased excitability of the flexor musculature on the spastic side may be paralleled by increases in activity in the segmental pathways responsible for modulation of agonist/antagonist activity in the ipsi and contralateral limb, leading to an inhibition of the ipsilateral extensors and contralateral flexors and excitatory input to the contralateral extensors. Thus the \"good\" side of hemiparetic patients also receives pathological changes, and studies of the mechanisms of spasticity should avoid the use of the \"unaffected\" side of hemiparetic subjects as a control for monitoring pathological reflexes.\r"

Cessation of the vibration led to a small short-latency (approximately 25 ms) reduction in the level of activity which did not differ in magnitude from the normal. Moreover, there was no sign of any subsequent long-latency reduction of activity. Thus the maintained tonic activity of Parkinsonian muscles seems unlikely to be due to an enhancement of the tonic reflex actions of the Ia afferents, especially via the short-latency pathway. In addition, the findings argue against reduction of either Ia or Ib firing being responsible for the delayed excitatory \"Westphal\" (or \"shortening\") response that may occur in parkinsonism on allowing a muscle to shorten; this was never found on terminating vibration, even when present on muscle release.\r"

Neither the duration of Parkinson's disease nor the duration of levodopa therapy discriminated between patients with and patients without peak-dose dyskinesia. Consequently, these criteria could not determine whether the first appearance of peak-dose dyskinesia depends on the duration of Parkinson's disease--a factor that is related to the severity of the disease--or on the duration of levodopa therapy. A subgroup of nineteen patients with unilateral or unequivocally asymmetrical peak-dose dyskinesia was examined 12 hours after withdrawal of levodopa. A levodopa testdose provoked unilateral or unilateral preponderant peak-dose dyskinesia which always involved the most severely affected side and which also happened to be the side of onset of the disease. This demonstrates that the severity of Parkinson's disease is the main risk factor for peak-dose dyskinesia.\r"

Orbital venography showed an occlusion of the superior ophthalmic vein in one of three patients. MRI showed an abnormal soft tissue area in the cavernous sinus, with intermediate to high signal intensity on T1- or intermediate weighted images. There was clinical improvement following corticosteroid therapy and the abnormal soft tissue on MRI decreased in volume and in signal intensity, although this was equivocal in one patient.

All had recurrent, carotid territory, neurological symptoms considered haemodynamic in origin. Six had occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery. Cerebral blood flow studies confirmed diminished cerebrovascular reserve in six patients studied. In five patients (six procedures) angioplasty of the stenosed internal carotid artery was carried out successfully. With two patients technical difficulty in crossing the stenosis prevented angioplasty and in one patient with bilateral stenosis the procedure was not attempted on the second side because of the severity of the stenosis. In two patients transient aphasia developed during cannulation of the carotid artery and in another a transient monoparesis developed during the procedure. Both these haemodynamic complications recovered within ten minutes. No other complications occurred. Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty is technically feasible in the management of stenotic carotid disease associated with haemodynamic stroke. It is a technically simple procedure requiring only a brief admission to hospital. However, its general application to patients with thromboembolic carotid-territory stroke will depend on the risk/benefit ratio compared to carotid endarterectomy or to conventional medical treatment.\r"

Symptoms reflecting central nervous system dysfunction are common and include muscle weakness, headache, sensory disturbances, poor short term memory and impairment of concentration. In view of the fact that sensory and cognitive disturbances are experienced by many patients objective evidence was sought with multi-modality sensory evoked potentials and auditory event-related cognitive potentials in a group of ME patients both with and without the enteroviral antigen, VP1 test positive. The auditory brainstem, median nerve somatosensory and pattern reversal checkerboard visual potentials were normal for all 37 patients tested. In contrast to the sensory potentials significant differences in the mean latencies of the cognitive potential N2 and P3 were found. Reaction times were also significantly prolonged but the performance in terms of error was not significantly affected. No significant difference emerged in any of the parameters for the VP1 test. P3 was abnormal in latency or amplitude in 36% of the VP1 positive patients for the frequency discrimination task and 48% for the more difficult duration discrimination task. The abnormalities indicate attentional deficits in some patients and slower speed of information processing in others. The prolonged latencies observed in these patients have not been observed in patients with depression in many other studies.\r"

The SIP is a validated instrument that assesses the presence of health-related behavior changes and activity restrictions in 12 different categories. Functional impairment, defined as a SIP score of 2.0% or greater, was present among 36.6% of diabetic subjects. Following adjustments for age, Mexican Americans were 1.63 times more likely to experience functional impairment that non-Hispanic whites, although this difference was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval: 0.92-2.89). The categories in which subjects experienced impairment varied widely, but the category with the highest prevalence of impairment was \"eating\" (greater than 40%). The prevalence of functional impairment was 45.9% among diabetic subjects with vascular complications, 31.8% among diabetic subjects without complications, and 16.7% among nondiabetic control subjects. Among all diabetic subjects impairment increased with age, duration of diabetes, fasting glucose, and BMI, and with insulin use and the presence of hypertension. In a multiple logistic regression model these factors (with the exception of insulin use) remained associated with the presence of functional impairment even after adjustment for the presence of vascular complications. If the factors responsible for this excess of functional impairment can be identified, an intervention might be designed which can lead to improvement in the quality of life for diabetic individuals.\r"

Each method was examined for its performance in using the same independent variables to develop predictive models for survival of a large cohort of patients with lung cancer. The cogent biologic attributes of the patients had previously been divided into five ordinal stages having a strong prognostic gradient. With stratified random sampling, we prepared seven \"generating\" sets of data in which the five biologic stages were arranged in proportional, uniform, symmetrical unimodal, decreasing exponential, increasing exponential, U-shaped, or bi-modal distributions. Each of the multivariable methods was applied to each of the seven generating distributions, and the results were tested in a separate \"challenge\" set, which had not been included in any of the generating sets. The research was intended not merely to compare the performance of the multivariable methods, but also to see how their performance would be affected by different statistical distributions of the same cogent biologic attributes. The results, which are presented in the second and third papers, were compared for selection of independent variables and coefficients, and for accuracy in fitting the generating sets and the challenge set.\r"

Each model developed from the generating sets was also applied for predictions in a previously sequestered \"challenge set\". Across the different generating sets, the multivariable methods showed good agreement with one another in the stepwise choice of first two powerful predictor variables, but not in the sequence of subsequent choices or in the standardized coefficients assigned to the same collection of \"forced\" variables. In concordance of predictions for individual patients in the generating sets, the overall proportions of disagreement for pairs of methods ranged from 0 to 28%, and kappa values ranged from 0.49 to 1.00. The accuracy of individual predictions showed relatively similar results when the different methods were applied to the same generating set. Across the generating sets, the different methods showed similar total results but substantial variations in predictions for alive and dead patients. When the models from the generating sets were applied for predictions in the challenge set, the results showed an analogous pattern: similar accuracy within models for overall and live/dead predictions, but substantial variations in live/dead predictions across models derived from different generating sources. The results showed that the multivariable methods often had good agreement with one another in predictions for groups but not for individual persons; and that no single method was superior to the others or to the composite staging system. We conclude that multivariable analytic methods may be most effective and consistent if used to find the few most powerful predictor variables, omitting the many other variables that may be \"statistically significant\" but less cogent. The powerful predictors may sometimes be best constructed, before the analysis begins, as composite variables containing appropriate unions or ordinal arrangements of elemental candidate variables.\r"

Recently referred subjects were approached and 216 chronically ill subjects (from oncology, rheumatology and gastroenterology clinics) completed a Meaning of Illness Questionnaire, the McMaster Family Assessment Device, and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Self-report Scale. In addition, information describing their biological, disease and socioeconomic status was obtained from the clinic record. Respondents were generally representative of other new referrals to the clinics (ineligible for the subsequent trial) in disease characteristics but uniformly came from a more advantaged socioeconomic situation and were better adjusted to illness. Subjects from the three clinics were comparable on meaning, family function and adjustment variables. The proportion of subjects with family dysfunction was 30% and with poor adjustment to illness was 36%, high by community standards. Nevertheless, healthy family functioning and high levels of positive adjustment to chronic illness prevailed and were remarkably similar across clinic settings. Severity or type of disease was not related to adjustment outcomes nor to the level of observed disability. Rather, as hypothesized, meaning given the illness, followed by family function, and disability variables combined to explain 57% of the variance in adjustment outcomes. An intervention designed to improve family function and the meaning given illness was judged suitable.\r"

In males aged 40-59, systolic blood pressure showed a range in age-adjusted town means of 9.0 mmHg (p less than 0.05); in females the difference of 8.6 mmHg was not significant (p = 0.14). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic at age 40-59 were significantly different between towns for both sexes. Differences at age 25-29 were of a similar magnitude, and the mean town blood pressures at 25-29 correlated highly with those at 40-59 [systolic; males r = 0.74 (p less than 0.05), females r = 0.65 (p = 0.059)]. The ranking of town blood pressures in an earlier study was reflected in the present study, but stronger associations were observed with cardiovascular mortality. It is concluded that geographical blood pressure variations in Britain are established by age 25-29 years.\r"

  ".W": "This paper focuses on the appropriateness of outcome measures to evaluate trauma care. The preventable death rate (PDR), based on the study of deceased patients only, has been the traditional measure of the impact of trauma care on improving the survival of patients with severe trauma. Another measure frequently used in other ares of evaluation research is the effectiveness rate--i.e. the survival rate in the total population of severe trauma patients. Because both the PDR and the effectiveness rate vary with the proportion of patients who would die even under conditions of optimal care, these two measures can be misleading. We illustrate their inadequacy by using published data on the impact of regionalization of trauma care. We propose the use of a third outcome measure of the impact of trauma care on survival, the efficacy rate--i.e. the survival rate among severe trauma patients with a potential for survival. Evaluation of trauma care should also measure outcomes other than survival and need not be restricted to patients with the most severe trauma. Evaluation of trauma care therefore requires outcome measures, such as the efficacy rate, which are based on the population at risk of manifesting the outcome of interest.\r"

Although various models provided an excellent fitting, both on the whole dataset and using a training-testing approach to a priori identified separate subset, the observed extent of variation in breast cancer risk between highest and lowest decile of the distribution was limited to a factor 2. This indicates that the 5 variables considered did not allow identification of subgroups with substantially elevated risk of breast cancer to have practical implications for screening/prophylactic treatment purposes.\r"

Some unexpected side-effects of prescription drugs are indications for the prescribing of another kind of drug. If the risk of such a side-effect is high, it should be reflected in clustered prescribing of the side-effect-alleviating drug in sequence with the side-effect-causing drug. The risk of drug-attributable side-effects can be estimated by comparing average incidences of initial prescriptions for the side-effect-alleviating drug before, during, and long after the dispensing of the presumed side-effect-causing drug. We monitored computerized, complete drug dispensing records of anonymous outpatients for use of flunarizine, an anti-vertigo/anti-migraine drug that case reports had suggested causes mental depression and/or Parkinsonism. Among 1284 patients who eventually got flunarizine during a 31 month period, 1 in 7 was started on an anti-depressant before or long after flunarizine; only 1 in 82 might be said to have been started on an anti-depressant because of flunarizine. There was no evidence that anti-Parkinson drugs were started because of flunarizine, though the numbers are small. The analysis takes only a few days, and can help set bounds on risks of the subset of adverse drug reactions that are themselves indications for use of other drugs.\r"

Cigarette-smoking has emerged as an important predictor of low birth weight due to intrauterine growth retardation and pre-term delivery. After confirming the relation of smoking with birth weight, we examined the association of smoking with sociodemographic factors, attitudes towards pregnancy, health behaviors, stressful life events, social support, and symptoms of mental distress in a cohort of 458 Central Harlem women. We found that social support, stress and mental health were associated with smoking behavior but not directly with birth weight. These findings suggest that programs designed to modify health behaviors such as smoking during pregnancy must also take into account such characteristics of the women and their environments which may make behavioral change difficult. Moreover, programs aimed at fostering better health behaviors to improve pregnancy outcome may have to extend beyond the current pregnancy, as indicated by an association between prior adverse pregnancy outcome and smoking in the current pregnancy.\r"

To address these issues, we conducted a follow-up study of 1590 individuals treated between 1938 and 1969 with X-rays for childhood lymphoid hyperplasia (av. thyroid dose = 24 cGy) and 1499 individuals treated with surgery only. Thyroid nodularity was determined from self-administered questionnaires completed by 1195 irradiated and 1063 surgically-treated subjects and from clinical examinations of 602 irradiated and 457 non-irradiated subjects. A much higher relative risk (RR) for radiation-induced thyroid nodules was estimated from the questionnaire than from the clinical examination data, 15.8 and 2.7, respectively. (The corresponding estimates of excess RR per cGy were 64 and 7%). Analysis of the examination data revealed a strong dose-response relationship, similar excess RR/cGy for males and females, and an inverse relationship with age at exposure. Although the thyroid gland is one of the most sensitive organs to the neoplastic effects of radiation, the radiation-induced risk of thyroid nodularity reported from questionnaire studies may over-estimate the true risk.\r"

A questionnaire asking information about smoking, alcohol consumption and iron intake was completed by a consecutive series of 796 ambulatory singleton pregnant women at 31-32 weeks of gestation. Subsequently, haematologic parameters were measured. After delivery, birth weight, gestation length and blood pressure values during pregnancy were abstracted from the obstetricians' records. Low birth weight (less than 2.500 g) and preterm birth (less than 37 weeks), were significantly more frequently seen in women with high haemoglobin (greater than or equal to 8.0 mmol/l) or high haematocrit (greater than 38%) values, with Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios varying from 2.4 to 4.2. Also a high erythrocyte count (greater than or equal to 4.5/pl) was correlated with low birth weight, while for mean corpuscular volume (MCV) no such relationships were found. Pregnancy induced hypertension was positively associated with haemoglobin, haematocrit and erythrocyte count, but could not fully explain the relationships between these parameters and adverse outcomes. Using multiple logistic regression with low birth weight and or preterm birth as the dependent variable, the effect of haematocrit still was demonstrable after controlling for smoking, hypertension, parity, alcohol consumption and iron intake. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that a higher blood viscosity is a risk factor for suboptimal placenta-perfusion.\r"

In 1976-1978, neuropsychologic testing was administered to 1993 participants aged 55-89 years. Performance on an education-adjusted composite of these tests was examined in relation to measures of chronicity of hypertension as well as the average systolic and average diastolic blood pressure. All analyses were stratified by antihypertensive medication use during the 2 years prior to cognitive testing and adjusted for age, sex, occupation, alcohol consumption, and participation rate in prior examination cycles. Among subjects on drug therapy for hypertension, there was no association between cognitive performance and longitudinally measured blood pressure. The proportion of cycles in which hypertension was present and average systolic and diastolic blood pressure had a significant inverse relation with cognitive performance only in the group not on antihypertensive drug therapy. However, among subjects on antihypertensive medication at earlier cycles, there was a highly significant graded relation between cognitive impairment and the probability of being off medication at the time of testing. These results suggest that hypertension-related subclinical vascular disease is not an important cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly. Cognitive impairment may, however, be associated with a reduced adherence to drug treatment regimens.\r"

  ".W": "The controlled clinical trial has largely replaced case-reports as the authoritative source of information concerning the efficacy of treatment. However, many situations arise in clinical practice where treatment decisions cannot be made on the basis of such studies. The definitive clinical trial may not have been performed, or the results from a particular study may not be applicable to a particular patient. Recently, \"N-of-1\" studies have been proposed for the experimental evaluation of therapy in a single patient. Multiple courses of active and placebo treatments are administered, and efficacy is determined by following the response measure over a period of time. The purpose of this paper is to present a statistical model appropriate for data arising from this design. The model provides for serial correlation among the response measures captured from the subject, and for heteroskedasticity across the treatment periods. ML estimation procedures are considered, and their properties are investigated. A scoring algorithm is described to iterate to the solution of the ML equations, and considerations for hypothesis testing are presented. The techniques are illustrated through an example.\r"

Prescription-event monitoring (PEM), which has been developed by the Drug Safety Research Unit, is the first large-scale systematic post-marketing surveillance method to use event monitoring in the U.K. PEM identifies patients, who have been prescribed a particular drug, and their doctors from photocopies of National Health Service prescriptions which are processed centrally in England. A personalized follow-up questionnaire (\"green form\") is mailed to each patient's general practitioner, usually on the first anniversary of the initial prescription, asking for information about the patient, especially any \"events\" that he or she may have experienced since beginning treatment with the drug. The methodology of PEM is presented, together with examples of analyses that can be performed using results from recent studies. The problems and benefits of PEM are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical, radiographic, and anatomical features in 80 patients with ophthalmic segment aneurysms were reviewed, and were categorized according to a presumed origin related to the ophthalmic (41 cases) or superior hypophyseal (39 cases) arteries. There was a marked female predominance (7:1) and high incidence of multiple aneurysms (45%) within this population. Clinical presentations included subarachnoid hemorrhage in 23 cases (29%) and visual deficits in 24 (30%); five patients exhibited both hemorrhage and visual loss. Twenty-eight aneurysms were incidentally identified. Ophthalmic artery aneurysms arose from the internal carotid artery (ICA) just distal to the ophthalmic artery, pointed superiorly or superomedially, and (when large) deflected the carotid artery posteriorly and inferiorly, closing the siphon. Abnormalities relating to vision were not identified until the aneurysm realized giant proportions. The optic nerve was typically displaced superomedially, which restricted contralateral extension until late in the clinical course; unilateral nasal field loss was seen in 12 patients. Nine patients had bilateral ophthalmic artery aneurysms which were often clipped via a unilateral craniotomy. Superior hypophyseal artery aneurysms arose just above the dural ring from the medial bend of the ICA, at the site of perforator origin to the superior aspect of the hypophysis, and had no direct association with the ophthalmic artery. The carotid artery was usually located lateral or superolateral relative to the aneurysm. These lesions could extend medially beneath the chiasm (suprasellar variant), producing a clinical and computerized tomography picture similar to a pituitary adenoma, or they could extend ventrally to burrow beneath the anterior clinoid process (paraclinoid variant). Preoperative categorization of these lesions according to their likely branch of origin provides excellent correlation with visual deficits and operative findings, and has allowed the author to clip 52 of 54 lesions, with very low operative or visual morbidity.\r"

Unlike cases of dural AVM's in other locations, sudden massive intracerebral hemorrhage was the most frequent reason for presentation. Other symptoms included tinnitus, retro-orbital headache, and a generalized seizure. The malformations were supplied consistently by the anterior ethmoidal artery, usually in combination with other less prominent feeding vessels. The lesion's venous drainage was through the superior sagittal sinus via a cortical vein; in addition, in two cases a subfrontal vein drained the AVM. A venous aneurysm was encountered near the site of anastomosis with the dural feeder in most cases, and was found in all patients who presented with hemorrhage. The AVM was obliterated surgically in six patients, with favorable results achieved in five. One patient died postoperatively from a pulmonary complication. Because of their anatomy and proclivity for hemorrhage, these vascular malformations represent a unique group of dural AVM's. Surgical management of anterior fossa dural AVM's carries low morbidity, and is indicated when the lesions have caused hemorrhage or when there is an associated venous aneurysm.\r"

  ".W": "Because of a suspicion that intraoperative penicillin antibiotics might be causing early postoperative seizures in craniotomy patients, a deliberate effort was initiated in 1987 to avoid these agents in favor of nonpenicillin antibiotics. This permitted a retrospective comparison of the incidence of early postoperative seizures in craniotomy patients who did and who did not receive intraoperative penicillins. Records of patients treated between July 1, 1984, and July 1, 1985, and between July 1, 1987, and July 1, 1988, were reviewed, for a total of 1316 procedures. There were no seizures in the 323 patients who underwent suboccipital craniectomy. However, among the 993 patients receiving supratentorial procedures there were 30 with seizures within the first 6 hours postoperatively, 19 of which were generalized seizures. The incidence of early seizures was 4.7% (20 cases) of the 427 patients given penicillins and only 1.8% (10 cases) of the 566 not given penicillins (p less than 0.01). Since patients undergoing surgery for intractable seizures have a high incidence of early postoperative seizures (11 of 92 in this series, or 12%), creation of a subgroup eliminated these from consideration but did not alter the relationship of penicillins to early seizures (p less than 0.02). The authors conclude that intraoperative (and early postoperative) penicillin antibiotic administration should be avoided, if possible, in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial pathology.\r"

  ".W": "Direct operations were performed on 206 patients with aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) using a bifrontal craniotomy and an interhemispheric approach. A total of 44 (21.4%) of these patients had vascular anomalies in the vicinity of the ACoA; these included a median artery of the corpus callosum (MACC) in 27 cases (13.1%), duplication of the ACoA in 20 (9.7%), and duplication of the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery in one (0.5%). A retrospective study of the angiograms indicated that diagnosis of the A1 or ACoA duplication was not possible; only 11 (41%) of the 27 MACC's were easily identified, while eight (30%) could not be diagnosed. The majority of the cases of ACoA aneurysms with MACC (81.5%) showed trifurcation of the ACoA, A2, and MACC. The operative results in the patients with MACC did not differ significantly from the results of the entire ACoA aneurysm series. From the above study it is concluded that, regardless of whether a vascular anomaly has been identified preoperatively, ACoA aneurysm surgery should be undertaken with that possibility in mind. A bifrontal craniotomy and an interhemispheric approach has the advantage of allowing for a wide operative field and the attainment of a good understanding of the vascular structures near the ACoA. It is particularly useful in cases of vascular anomaly in this region.\r"

Etiology of pain included avulsion of brachial or lumbosacral plexuses (27 cases), spinal cord injury (20 cases), amputation (nine cases), post-herpetic neuralgia (16 cases), and cauda equina injury (six cases). Three different lesioning techniques were employed: a radiofrequency (rf) method using a 0.5 X 2-mm stainless steel electrode with control of electric current and duration (Group 1: 21 cases); the CO2 laser (Group 2: 20 cases); and an rf method, using a 0.25 X 2-mm stainless steel electrode with control of electrode temperature and duration (Group 3: 37 cases). Overall, 48 (61.5%) of 78 patients received satisfactory pain relief, defined as a 50% or greater reduction in pain intensity, cessation of narcotic analgesic usage, and improvement in functional capacity. Fourteen (67%) of the 21 Group 1 patients obtained effective pain relief, compared to nine (45%) of the 20 Group 2 patients and 25 (68%) of the 37 Group 3 patients. Neurological complications including mainly ipsilateral leg weakness or loss of proprioception occurred in 52.3% of the patients in Group 1, 15% of the Group 2 patients, and 8.1% of the Group 3 patients. These results support the view that DREZ lesions may be made most effectively and safely with the rf lesioning technique associated with control of electrode temperature and duration.\r"

  ".W": "Tauromustine (TCNU), 130 mg/sq m, was administered intraoperatively by nasogastric tube to 10 patients with malignant glioma (seven glioblastomas and three anaplastic astrocytomas). High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of 32 tumor specimens for TCNU revealed that tissue concentrations ranged from 0 to 554 ng/gm: TCNU was not detected in necrotic regions of the tumor. Levels of TCNU in brain adjacent to tumor were similar to those recorded within the gliomas (range 0 to 635 ng/gm). The variability in the tissue level of TCNU was partly attributable to variable absorption of the drug, since peak plasma TCNU levels ranged from 164 to 3333 ng/ml. There were close quantitative and temporal relationships between the times of peak plasma levels (median 456 ng/ml at 45 minutes after administration), peak tumor levels (median 250 ng/gm tissue at 55 minutes), and brain adjacent to tumor levels (median 256 ng/gm tissue at 50 minutes). Linear regression analysis of the ratio between tissue and plasma TCNU levels at particular times after drug administration suggest that plasma concentrations can be used to estimate tissue concentrations. This study demonstrates that TCNU enters malignant glioma. In view of the activity of TCNU against a range of tumors, a full clinical evaluation of this new nitrosourea in malignant glioma seems justified.\r"

The average age at the time of myelomeningocele repair was 6.6 days. Statistical analysis showed that repair of the myelomeningocele defect before 48 hours of age did not reduce the occurrence of ventriculitis. The incidence of ventriculitis secondary to the management of the myelomeningocele lesion was 12.5%. Complications after repair of the myelomeningocele (including skin flap necrosis, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and wound infection) were present in 43.8% of the patients who developed ventriculitis and in 19.0% of those who did not. This observation is statistically significant (p = 0.03) and indicates that complications of healing after myelomeningocele repair represent the most significant risk factor for the development of ventriculitis.\r"

The animals were shielded so that respiratory and digestive tissues would not be damaged by the radiation. Survival rates in rats that received whole-brain irradiation as a single 7500-rad dose under pentobarbital- or lidocaine-induced anesthesia was increased from between from 0% and 20% to between 45% and 69% over the 40 days of observation compared with the other two groups (p less than 0.007). Ketamine anesthesia provided no protection. There were no notable differential effects upon non-neural tissues, suggesting that pentobarbital afforded protection through modulation of ambient neural activity during radiation exposure. Neural suppression during high-dose cranial irradiation protects brain from acute and early delayed radiation injury. Further development and application of this knowledge may reduce the incidence of radiation toxicity of the central nervous system (CNS) and may permit the safe use of otherwise \"unsafe\" doses of radiation in patients with CNS neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "Radiation therapy is an important component of brain tumor treatment, but its efficacy is limited by its toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue. Pentobarbital acts as a cerebral radioprotectant, but the selectivity of its protection for the central nervous system has not been demonstrated. To determine if pentobarbital also protects tumor against ionizing radiation, five groups of Fischer 344 rats were observed after exposure to varying combinations of the presence or absence of implanted tumor, pentobarbital, and radiation treatment. The first three groups underwent cerebral implantations of a suspension of 9L gliosarcoma cells. Group 1 was left untreated and served as tumor-bearing controls. Group 2 received 30 Gy of whole-brain x-irradiation without anesthesia 8 days after tumor implantation. Group 3 received the same radiation treatment 15 minutes after pretreatment with 60 mg/kg of pentobarbital intraperitoneally. Groups 4 and 5 served as radiation controls, receiving 30 Gy of x-irradiation while awake and 30 Gy of x-irradiation after pentobarbital administration, respectively. Survival was calculated from the death of the last tumor-bearing rat. The mean survival time in tumor-bearing control rats was 20.8 +/- 2.6 days (+/- standard deviation). X-irradiation alone significantly enhanced the period of survival in rats implanted with the 9L tumor (29.7 +/- 5.6 days, p less than 0.03). Further significant prolongation of survival was seen with the addition of pentobarbital to the treatment regimen (39.9 +/- 13.5 days, p less than 0.01). Nontumor-bearing rats irradiated while awake (Group 4) survived 30.9 +/- 2.3 days. All of their pentobarbital-anesthetized counterparts in Group 5 survived. If pentobarbital had offered radioprotection to the tumor, then Group 3 would have had a shorter survival period than Group 2. This implies that the enhancement of survival time after irradiation results from selective protection of normal brain in this model.\r"

  ".W": "Pentobarbital reduces cerebral radiation toxicity; however, the mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. As an anesthetic and depressant of cerebral metabolism, pentobarbital induces its effects on the central nervous system by stimulating the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to its receptor and by inhibiting postsynaptic excitatory amino acid activity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of these actions as well as other aspects of the radioprotective activity of pentobarbital. Fischer 344 rats were separated into multiple groups and underwent two dose-response evaluations. In one set of experiments to examine the relationship of radioprotection to pentobarbital dose, a range of pentobarbital doses (0 to 75 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally prior to a constant-level radiation dose (70 Gy). In a second series of experiments to determine the dose-response relationship of radiation protection to radiation dose, a range of radiation doses (10 to 90 Gy) were given with a single pentobarbital dose (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Further groups of animals were used to evaluate the importance of the timing of pentobarbital administration, the function of the (+) and (-) isomers of pentobarbital, and the role of an alternative GABA agonist (diazepam). In addition, the potential protective effects of alternative methods of anesthesia (ketamine) and induction of cerebral hypometabolism (hypothermia) were examined. Enhancement of survival time from acute radiation injury due to high-dose single-fraction whole-brain irradiation was maximal with 60 mg/kg of pentobarbital, and occurred over the range of all doses examined between 30 to 90 Gy. Protection was seen only in animals that received the pentobarbital before irradiation. Administration of other compounds that enhance GABA binding (Saffan and diazepam) also significantly enhanced survival time. Ketamine and hypothermia were without protective effect. Protection from acute radiation-induced mortality by pentobarbital in the rat model is a reproducible phenomenon and is associated with the GABA agonistic activity of the compound. This property of GABA agonists offers the potential for a novel approach to enhancement of the efficacy of radiation therapy in the treatment of brain tumors.\r"

In this study, the binding of a 4'-chloro analog of diazepam (Ro 5-4864) to rabbit choroid plexus and cerebral cortex was accomplished utilizing an in vitro radioactive assay method. A kinetic analysis of this binding revealed a relatively high affinity of this ligand (KD) for peripheral binding sites in plexus tissue (KD = 16.1 nM/mg protein). There was a 4.6-fold greater density of binding sites (total receptor density (Bmax) = 2.3 pmol/mg) in choroidal membrane as compared to cortical tissue (Bmax = 0.5 pmol/mg). In 40 rabbits in which a ventricular perfusion system was used, the rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) formation was observed to decrease some 48% in the presence of 10(-4) M Ro 5-4864, although some inhibition of secretory activity was still noted at a CSF concentration of 10(-8) M. The choroid plexus tissue levels of adenosine 3',5'cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) were not affected by 10(-4) M Ro 5-4864. The results of this study support the notion that the specific benzodiazepine peripheral binding sites in choroid plexus serve to modulate CSF formation. The mechanism of action is poorly understood but does not involve the transport ATPase system or the second messenger cAMP.\r"

  ".W": "Serial proton (1H) and phosphorus-31 (31P) magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy of cerebral infarction was performed in rats to assess the sensitivity of these techniques for use in clinical cerebral infarction. In this experimental chronic infarction model, 31P spectroscopy tended to return to a \"normal\" pattern within 24 hours after induction of infarction in spite of pathologically proven completed infarction and, therefore, appeared not to be sensitive enough for clinical application. On the other hand, proton spectroscopy invariably showed persistent high lactate levels and was capable of distinguishing completed infarction from reperfused recovered brain. Persistent high lactate levels appear to be a good MR spectroscopic indicator of completed infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The short-term (less than or equal to 72-hour) reaction to subarachnoid injections of various blood components was determined in a canine model of cerebral vasospasm. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) formed durable clots in the basal cistern surrounding the basilar artery and provoked no vascular reaction in 72 hours or more. Freshly isolated autologous erythrocytes resuspended in PRP likewise provoked no vasoconstriction in 72 hours although a second injection of fresh erythrocytes in PRP induced significant reaction, as in the conventional \"double subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)\" canine model. Hemolysate of fresh erythrocytes led to a severe immediate vascular reaction after introduction into the basal cistern using PRP as the carrier/clotting medium, as did the injection of intact erythrocytes incubated ex vivo for 72 hours. Resolution of the initial reaction was rapid for hemolysate, but slow and (depending on hematocrit) incomplete for intact \"aged\" erythrocytes. In vitro measurements of erythrocyte lysis in these media and histological examination indicate that the production of erythrocyte lysate was responsible for the vascular reaction observed, suggesting that the rate of lysis of erythrocytes in the subarachnoid clot is a major factor in the genesis of vasospasm after SAH.\r"

Thymidine concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml completely inhibited C6 proliferation while concentrations of 100 to 1000 micrograms/ml (for up to 24 hours) decreased C6 cell survival to as little as 7.4% compared to untreated control cells. Radiosensitivity was enhanced by the administration of thymidine alone (400 micrograms/ml x 24 hours before irradiation); sensitization by 41.8 degrees C hyperthermia alone (1 hour ending immediately before irradiation) was less pronounced. Thymidine and hyperthermia together produced greater radiosensitization than did heat alone or thymidine alone. These data support the further investigation of thymidine as a neuro-oncology radiosensitizer.\r"

Both CGRP and VIP induced dose-dependent relaxations in ring segments of the intact basilar artery of control dogs. The vasorelaxant action of CGRP was more potent than that of VIP. The single-injection model of SAH was produced by injection of fresh autologous arterial blood (1 ml/kg body weight) into the cisterna magna on Day 0 of the post-SAH period, and the double-injection model was produced by two injections of blood (0.5 ml/kg each) on Days 0 and 2. Narrowing of the basilar arteries on vertebral angiograms was most prominent on Day 3 or 7 in the single- or double-injection model, respectively. Relaxation of the basilar artery induced by CGRP and VIP was to some extent decreased on Days 3 and 7 of the post-SAH period in the single-injection model, and on Days 7 and 14 in the double-injection model. However, the vasorelaxant effects of CGRP and VIP were significantly enhanced on Day 14 of the post-SAH period in the single-injection model, and on Days 28 and 42 in the double-injection model. Subsequently, these effects returned to control levels by Days 28 or 63 in the single- or double-injection model, respectively.\r"

Labeled immunoglobulin correctly identified presence, location, extent and soft-tissue involvement of the suspected inflammatory site. In these patients, focally increasing accumulation was noted over 48 hr. Discrimination between infection and sterile inflammatory lesions was not possible. Two fractures, 6-mo-old, and an aseptic loosening of a total-hip prosthesis were not visualized. Side effects after the immunoglobulin administration were not observed. Radiolabeled immunoglobulin is a new and safe radiopharmaceutical for the investigation of infectious bone and joint disease. The sensitivity of this agent appears at least as high as that of labeled leukocytes. However, labeled immunoglobulin can easily be prepared in every nuclear medicine department.\r"

After labeling with 99mTc, 555 MBq, 99mTc-MAb (0.5 mg antibody) were slowly injected intravenously over a period of 5 min. A whole-body scan was done 4-6 hr postinjection, and planar or SPECT images were performed 6, 18, and 24 hr postinjection. Leukocyte immunoscintigraphy proved inflammatory suppurating processes in 20 cases (true-positive) and excluded them in 11 cases (true-negative). The findings were false-positive in two patients (hematoma without signs of infection, pseudoarthrosis) and false-negative in one patient (encapsulated lung abscess with pleural fibrosis). Anti-idiotypic human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) were found only in one out of 20 patients. According to our experiences, immunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-MAb BW 250/183 has a sensitivity of 95%, and is, therefore, well suited for the identification of leukocytic inflammations.\r"

Ninety-four patients with biopsy-documented cirrhosis had, at the time of entry into the study, a scintigraphy with 99mTc-phytate complexed with calcium in vivo. Extrahepatic uptake (EHU) of 99mTc-phytate on scintigraphy was graded from 0 (absent EHU) to 5 (important EHU) according to the relative distribution of the radiotracer between the liver, the spleen and the bone marrow. The severity of liver disease was also assessed according to the index of Child and Turcotte as modified by Pugh et al. Mean follow-up was 2 yr. EHU was correlated to the Pugh score (r = 0.73) and to survival. Survival at 2 yr was 97% for an EHU equal or inferior to 2.5, 62% for grades 3-4.5, and 31% for grade 5.

An equation is developed that relates total chamber volume, Vt, to the area of a pixel (M) and the ratio (R) of total counts within the chamber to the counts within the hottest pixel in the chamber such that Vt = 1.38 M3R3/2. The value of M is a constant for the particular scintillation camera-collimator system and R is obtained from observed count rates. All calculated volumes were compared to volumes measured using biplane contrast ventriculography. In 25 patients, the method for ventricular volumes gave an r of 0.95 and an s.e.e. of 23 ml [Volume (nuclear) = 0.94 Volume (cath) + 1.3]. Endsystolic volume was best calculated from end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction. Manual regions of interest were more accurate than automated regions of interest. This method appears to be as accurate as more complex approaches and has the advantage of not requiring attenuation correction or blood sampling.\r"

Agreement between [99mTc]MIBI and 201TI SPECT myocardial perfusion was seen in 93% of segments. Technetium-99m-MIBI appears to be an ideal radiopharmaceutical for the simultaneous evaluation of ventricular function and myocardial perfusion during stress and at rest.\r"

Myocyte net uptake of 99mTc-MIBI approached a plateau with a half-time of 9.3 +/- 1.5 min (mean +/- s.e.m.; n = 10). Tracer [99mTc]MIBI showed apparent competitive displacement by carrier [99Tc]MIBI at relatively high molar ratios ([99mTc]MIBI/[99Tc]MIBI) indicating a low affinity cellular retention process (apparent KD approximately 7 x 10(-5)). Metabolic inhibition induced by pre-incubation of cells for 2.5 hr in rotenone (10 microM), iodoacetate (1 mM), or both metabolic inhibitors together reduced 1-min [99mTc] MIBI uptake to 74.1% +/- 8.0% (p less than 0.05), 6.2% +/- 3.4% (p less than 0.01), and 10.1% +/- 3.6% of control (p less than 0.01), respectively (n = 11-12). Half-maximal inhibitory concentration of iodoacetate was approximately 5 microM. Iodoacetate inhibition of [99mTc]MIBI uptake kinetics was time-dependent; no significant effect on [99mTc]MIBI uptake was seen during the first 60 min of metabolic inhibition despite significant depletion of ATP content determined on the same preparations (control ATP: 40.2 nmoles/mg protein versus iodoacetate incubation: 2.8 nmoles/mg protein; p less than 0.01). However, prolonged metabolic blockade did eventually depress 1-min [99mTc]MIBI uptake. These data indicate that a late component of myocardial cell injury can depress [99mTc]MIBI cellular uptake.\r"

A new macrocyclic bifunctional chelating agent based on 1,4,7,10-tetraazacylododecane-N,N',N\",N\"'-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) forms a stable Y(III) complex. It was converted to p-bromoacetamidobenzyl-DOTA (BAD), and conjugated to monoclonal antibody Lym-1 via 2-iminothiolane, either as the free ligand or as the 88Y chelate. Stability studies of Lym-1-2IT-BAD-88Y in human serum in vitro showed no measurable loss of Y(III) from the ligand over a 25-day period. In Raji-tumored mice, tumor uptake was 16.8% of the injected dose per gram of tissue on Day 3. The bone uptake was 2.0, 3.6, and 2.1% injected dose per gram of tissue on Day 1, 3, and 5, respectively. The biodistribution of the control 88Y-citrate demonstrated continuous increase in bone uptake from 13.8% injected dose per gram on Day 1 to 24.9% injected dose per gram on Day 4.\r"

The second gamma ray has the energy of 124.8 keV and is emitted from the nucleus in 69% of the disintegrations. Together they furnish 107 easily collimated gamma rays per 100 decays. Xenon-127m is generated readily by bombarding nearly saturated aqueous solutions of sodium or potassium iodide with 14-MeV protons. The 127mXe is swept out continuously, as it is produced, by bubbling helium upward through the solutions. Up to approximately 100 mci/l are obtained from the resulting mixture of gases. The 127mXe + helium is admixed with about five volumes of air (or oxygen) and then driven continuously to a scintillation camera located approximately 200 yd distant. When the mixture of gases is inhaled, high quality images of the lungs are obtained by means of an Anger scintillation camera.\r"

It is, therefore, important to know the distribution of different attenuating tissues in order to be able to perform a proper attenuation correction. A correction method, based on correcting one pixel at a time by using density maps and build-up functions, has been developed. The density map has been produced by transmission measurements of the object using an external, solid 57Co flood source mounted on the scintillation camera head. The outline of the object is accurately defined by the map since the density values outside the object are very close to zero. The build-up of photons scattered in the object has been simulated by a Monte-Carlo code. SPECT-studies with 99mTc, 201T1 and 111In line sources in different parts of a non homogeneous Alderson phantom have been performed. The emission images have been corrected for photon attenuation using the measured density maps and the simulated build-up functions. The results show that quantitative measurements of the radioactivity in nonhomogeneous area can be accomplished to within +/- 10% for different radionuclides by using the attenuation correction described.\r"

Reducing agents are not used and, therefore, when radioiodinating F(ab')2 fragments, degradation does not occur. In contrast, chloramine-T, sodium metabisulfite (CT/SMB) iodinations of F(ab')2 fragments resulted in products with up to 40% Fab' fragments. Radiolabeling yields (65.8% +/- 8.1%) and antibody immunoreactivity (68.8% +/- 8.0%) were not statistically different (p less than 0.001) from those obtained in remote CT/SMB iodinations.

A retrospective study was undertaken. Twenty-seven patients with untreated thyrotoxic Graves' disease were given 3-5 microCi of 131I and EU and LU were determined with an uptake probe. We derived a \"best fit\" curve on plots of EU (X-axis) and LU (Y-axis). The equation for the curve (LU = -55.7 + 73.2 log EU) was used to predict late uptake (PU) from EU results on a second group of 24 similarly defined Graves' patients. PU and measured LU were then applied to 131I treatment calculations in these 24 patients. PU correlated closely with LU (r = 0.94). Dose calculations based on PU and LU gave very similar results (r = 0.97). Using this method, same day diagnosis and treatment of Graves' is achievable.\r"

Studying 108 consecutive cases from 1982 to 1985 and using clinical, biochemical, radiographic, and pathologic data, we performed a rigorous assessment of the accuracy and pitfalls of NP-59 scintigraphy. The evaluation was divided into categories of abnormal hormone secretion: Cushing's syndrome, primary aldosteronism, and hyperandrogenism. Additional categories included euadrenal tumors (without detectable hormone dysfunction) and sites of residual adrenal cortical tissue. The accuracy of NP-59 scintigraphy ranged from 71% in primary aldosteronism and 75% in euadrenal tumors, to 100% for Cushing's syndrome and hyperandrogenism. However, more than in most nuclear medicine studies, NP-59 imaging requires well-defined indications to be met for it to be efficacious, including the fulfillment of clear clinical, biochemical, and radiographic criteria. The high reproducibility of NP-59 scintigraphic interpretation was demonstrated when 40 random cases underwent interinstitutional exchange and through interobserver evaluation at the University of Michigan. Responses of 85/126 medical centers to questionnaires revealed the high level of NP-59 safety.\r"

Some of these have persisted and continue to influence the treatment programs available to alcoholics. One of the most popular explanatory models today is the traditional model, which prescribes abstinence as a treatment objective. However, more and more studies are showing that controlled drinking can be a viable alternative for many alcoholics. The aim of the present study is to determine the type of treatment goal preferred by alcoholism rehabilitation centers in the province of Quebec. As of March 31, 1987, the general directors of 78 of the 81 rehabilitation centers operating in Quebec were contacted and interviewed. The data most relevant to the present study came from the response to the following question: \"Is a treatment goal other than complete abstinence acceptable for every client who registers in your program to resolve a problem of alcoholism?\" The results indicate that most centers will not allow their clients to work toward any goal other than abstinence.\r"

For the most part, these respondents came from middle-class homes. As youthful offenders, many had been sent into treatment as an alternative to incarceration. Approximately six years after terminating their day-care treatments, interview data were collected when most were in their middle twenties. Consistent with previous research, those consuming more drugs were found to be more likely to have resisted treatment, to have trouble with the law, to have poorer work histories and diminished educational attainments, and they showed evidence of poorer psychological health. Surprisingly, the data also indicated that high-volume drug users were more likely to be living in their parental homes, compared to those whose drug use patterns were more moderate. It is suggested that the pattern of taking up residence with one's parents while drug dependent may be encouraged by parental enabling. The implications of these findings for guiding efforts in substance abuse treatment are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The relative efficacies of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) brain scans for the detection of intracranial pathology in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were evaluated prospectively. Fifty homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS and neurologic symptoms were evaluated using both modalities. In 24 patients, MR images and CT scans provided the same diagnostic information (within normal limits in 16, cerebral atrophy only in 6, and similar lesions in 2 patients). In only one instance did CT show the presence of a lesion not seen on MRI. In the 25 remaining patients, MRI was the more sensitive modality. MRI also reflected more consistently the histopathologically documented extent and distribution of central nervous system disease. The greater sensitivity of MRI suggested significant alterations in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management of 20 patients. Thus, MRI was as good or better than CT for the detection of intracranial pathology in 49 of 50 neurologically symptomatic AIDS patients and significantly affected the diagnosis and treatment of 40% of these patients. Although MRI does not appear to be more specific than other modalities in the differentiation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related neurologic diseases, its greater sensitivity suggests that MRI may be the best neuroimaging procedure for the initial radiologic evaluation of AIDS patients with neurologic illness.\r"

  ".W": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is the most common cause of blindness in AIDS. Twenty patients were treated with a 21-day course of foscarnet therapy by continuous infusion. Response to therapy was good in eight (47%) of 17 evaluable patients; partial arrest of progression was observed in eight (47%); and no response was obtained in one (6%). Foscarnet therapy did not lead to suppression of urinary excretion of CMV in four of 12 patients who nonetheless had improvement in retinal lesions. Toxic effects, especially reversible renal failure, were common, with blood creatinine increase in 50% and dialysis in two patients. Renal toxicity occurred primarily during the third week of therapy. Anemia (hemoglobin less than 80 g/L) occurred in 10 patients after a mean of 14.5 +/- 5.1 days of therapy and required transfusion. Review of this study and of data from a previous case series, however, was inconclusive regarding the additional benefit of a third week of therapy. Maintenance therapy was given to seven patients. Four had recurrence of CMV retinitis at a mean interval of 62 +/- 52 days. Only one patient has maintained prolonged remission on maintenance (greater than 24 weeks). Toxicity on the maintenance protocol included anemia (two of seven patients) and increased creatinine blood levels (one of seven patients). Zidovudine therapy in six patients did not contribute to increased toxicity of induction or maintenance therapy. Drug levels during continuous infusion were stable for individual patients but showed wide inter-patient variability. Peak levels of post-maintenance infusion varied both within and between patients.\r"

Fifteen consecutive men received isoprinosine 4 g/day (1 g q.i.d.), and 800 (9 men) or 1,200 mg/day (6 men) of ribavirin. Five men in each ribavirin dosage group completed at least 2 months of treatment. No unexpected toxicities were observed. Eight minor HIV-related events occurred in six men while on study. All men remained HIV-positive, and time to positive culture decreased by at least 4 days in three men from each treatment group. Serum p24 levels did not change in two men who were p24 antigenemic and received 800 mg/day of ribavirin. Treatment was associated with a generalized lymphopenia affecting all lymphocyte subsets including CD4, which was partially reversible 1 month after stopping treatment. Most of the men remained anergic on DTHS skin testing. No improvements were noted in in vitro lymphoproliferative responses to antigens or in NK cell activity (which decreased significantly in the 1,200 mg/day ribavirin group). Although well tolerated at the doses employed, the combination of ribavirin and isoprinosine produced an unexpected generalized lymphopenia and did not exhibit HIV-suppressive or immunorestorative effects.\r"

Other immunologic manifestations of FV infection in this murine host included inhibition of percent total T, T-helper, and T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells of total splenic lymphocytes and phytohemagglutinin-induced response of spleen cells. Interleukin-1 production was not affected but the numbers of splenic B cells were increased by the infection. 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) administered (a) intraperitoneally three times daily for 24 days beginning 4 h after virus inoculation in doses of 60 to 480 mg/kg/day, (b) in drinking water for 22 days beginning 4 h after virus inoculation in doses of 22 to 216 mg/kg/day, or (c) in drinking water for 29 days beginning 6 days after virus inoculation in doses of 22 to 216 mg/kg/day markedly inhibited FV-induced disease. In the mice receiving early-initiated AZT therapy, FV-induced splenomegaly and hematocrit values were inhibited and infectious centers in the spleen and FV titers in the plasma were reduced to below detectable levels at the higher AZT dosage levels. The percent of total T cells in splenic lymphocytes was increased in the infected, AZT-treated mice. In the intraperitoneal experiment, FV disease-induced death was prevented by treatment with all doses of AZT. Neutralizing antibody to FV was significantly reduced in all AZT-treated groups. Toxicologic manifestations of these AZT treatments included splenic enlargement and reduced hematocrit, although all treated, uninfected mice survived the treatments, gained weight, and displayed no significant effects on enumeration of T and B cells.\r"

  ".W": "A monocytic cell line, THP-1, was acutely infected with HIV, and the effects of various factors including INF-gamma, LPS, IL-2, and IL-6 were analyzed. While IFN-gamma suppressed HIV production, IL-2 and IL-6 augmented it. The suppressive effect of IFN-gamma was not overcome by IL-2 or by LPS. We studied whether the induction of IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) expression by those factors was related to HIV infection or not. By immunofluorescence analysis using monoclonal anti-IL-2R alpha antibody, we observed that HIV infection itself induced IL-2R alpha expression moderately in U937 and THP-1, and IL-6 as well as IFN-gamma highly induced IL-2R alpha expression both in uninfected and infected THP-1. Although induction of HIV production and IL-2R alpha expression by cytokines seem not to be directly correlated, these results suggest that soluble IL-2R alpha increased in AIDS patients might be at least partly derived from infected monocyte/macrophages activated by various cytokines, especially IL-6, which is mainly produced by themselves.\r"

These reports support the notion that the PCR is more sensitive and specific than other established HIV-1 detection techniques. However, due to its extreme sensitivity, the PCR is highly susceptible to contamination, resulting in false positive results. To avoid contamination, strict rules on sample preparation and pre- and post-PCR handling are required. Confirmation of both positive and negative PCR results by independent techniques is not always feasible, and, therefore, optimal PCR conditions, inclusion of control samples, repetition of results, and confirmation of specificity by hybridization are required. The choice of the material from which HIV-1 is amplified, the primers used for amplification as well as the PCR conditions will determine what is actually amplified.\r"

Less frequent is inclusion of the implantation site in an endometrial specimen obtained late in the luteal phase during the course of an infertility evaluation. From 1984 to 1987 the implantation site was sampled in 3 of 520 (0.6%) endometrial biopsies for infertility. In each instance the pregnancy did not continue. Two women conceived again within a year; both delivered term infants. The third woman had not conceived after ten months of follow-up. When an infertility biopsy results in a diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy, further evaluation of the patient should be determined by the clinical situation: even in couples with extremely compromised fertility the woman occasionally will become pregnant. The prognosis for that pregnancy may be poor; however, the prognosis for subsequently conceiving and carrying a pregnancy to term is encouraging. This study demonstrated the relative safety of endometrial sampling in the infertile woman. The use of barrier contraception during the cycle of sampling can further decrease the chance of interrupting an intrauterine pregnancy.\r"

The two groups were similar with respect to age, gestational age, race, weight, length of labor and of ruptured membranes, use of internal monitoring, blood loss and number of vaginal examinations. Standard febrile morbidity and postpartum endomyometritis requiring antibiotic therapy occurred in 18% and 12%, respectively, of the lavage group and in 16% and 12%, respectively, of the intravenous group. Before the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for cesarean section in labor on our service, the febrile morbidity and endomyometritis rates were 36% and 32%, respectively. The results confirm the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics for cesarean section in labor and demonstrate that the lavage and intravenous methods are similar with respect to efficacy.\r"

It works by extracting fluid from the cervical tissue and softening the cervix. This study evaluated its effectiveness in nonelective medical induction of labor in high-risk patients. Forty inpatients who, for medical and obstetric reasons, required delivery within the next 24-48 hours were studied. Patients were evaluated to make certain that a 12- to 24-hour delay was safe for mother and child. The evening prior to the day of induction, a pelvic examination determined the Bishop score, and bacterial cultures were obtained from the endocervix. As many Lamicels as possible (usually one to three) were then placed in the endocervix without rupturing the membranes. The next morning the devices were removed, a repeat Bishop score obtained, amniotomy performed, internal monitors placed and oxytocin infusion initiated. Data were collected for preinsertion and postinsertion Bishop scores, induction-delivery times, duration of ruptured membranes, and cesarean and vaginal birth rates. Maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity was determined. A comparison group of patients with premature rupture of the membranes was selected. From data studied at our institution, patients were matched for parity and duration of labor (not significantly different from the Lamicel group). The study revealed that Lamicel can be an effective means of ripening the cervix for induction of labor.\r"

We studied the scanning and transmission electron microscopic features of the rat polycystic ovary along with changes in serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations to further elucidate the mechanism of chronic anovulation during persistent estrus. The surface epithelium of the polycystic ovary showed no ovulatory stigmas and contained focal areas of degenerating and proliferating cells. The tunica albuginea was conspicuous, with many fibrils, collagenous materials and fibroblastlike cells adjoining the theca externa layer. The cytoplasm of theca interna cells contained numerous lipid vacuoles and images of extracted cholesterol crystals. The granulosa cells were atrophic and lacked the prominent Golgi apparatus typically found in granulosa cells of proestrous ovaries in cycling rats. With an increasing duration of constant light and chronic anovulation, the mean serum estradiol concentration in persistent-estrus rats was significantly higher and the mean serum progesterone concentration significantly lower than in age-matched controls. Alterations in estradiol-progesterone metabolism in the ovaries may be important etiologic factors in the pathogenesis of chronic anovulation found in polycystic ovary disease in rats.\r"

A prolonged second stage was associated more commonly with nulliparity, occiput posterior positioning, epidural anesthesia and a need for operative delivery but not birth weight greater than 4,000 g or a short umbilical cord. Infants born after a prolonged second stage did not have an increased incidence of umbilical artery pH less than 7.20 or of five-minute Apgar scores less than 7, nor did they need intensive care nursery admission. A prolonged second stage of labor appears not to impose an increased hazard on the fetus but does require close fetal monitoring and increases the possibility of operative delivery.\r"

One hundred eleven cases of stage I and II carcinoma of the breast treated from January 1985 to November 1988 were reviewed. Given an informed choice, 13 of the 30 patients (43.3%) treated by the author chose breast conservation over mastectomy, in striking contrast to a 97.5% incidence of mastectomy in the 81 patients treated by the general surgeons on the hospital staff. The role of the gynecologist in the treatment of breast cancer can be to offer a different viewpoint and thus possibly to become a major force in the reduction in the number of mastectomies.\r"

  ".W": "The regulatory signals responsible for the increased biosynthesis of prostaglandins during parturition have not been established. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is capable of stimulating prostaglandin production by intrauterine tissues and is an inflammation mediator. It has been postulated as a signal for the onset of labor in the setting of intrauterine infection. A study was designed to determine if spontaneous labor at term was associated with changes in IL-1 activity in amniotic fluid. Such fluid was retrieved from 41 women in labor and from 39 women who were not in labor at term. Immunodetectable IL-1 beta was present in 22 of the 41 women in labor but in only 8 of the 39 women without labor. IL-1-like bioactivity was not different between the two groups at a dilution of 1:4, but at dilutions of 1:12, 1:36 and 1:108, amniotic fluid from women in labor had significantly higher bioactivity than that from women not in labor. A significant correlation was found between the bioassay and immunoassay results. Our data show that inhibitors of IL-1 bioactivity are present in amniotic fluid and suggest that in a subset of laboring women at term, an inflammatory reaction may play a role in triggering the onset of parturition.\r"

Four hundred term gravidas presenting in the latent phase of labor were studied. Ninety (22.5%) exhibited abnormalities on the initial tracing, with the majority of those abnormalities (58.9%) including mild variable decelerations, either alone or in combination with other abnormalities. An analysis of the outcome for those patients revealed a significant increase in cesarean delivery for fetal distress and depressed one-minute Apgar scores when compared to patients with initially normal tracings. Analysis of subsequent FHR patterns in that group showed a significant increase in the incidence of atypical variable declerations and bradycardia. Patients with more than one abnormality on the initial FHR tracing showed a greater incidence of loss of variability, loss of reactivity and bradycardia on subsequent FHR tracings. Likewise, pregnancy outcome for this group was remarkable for an increased risk of meconium staining, cesarean delivery for fetal distress and depressed one-minute Apgar scores. An abnormal initial FHR tracing seems to be associated with the subsequent development of ominous FHR patterns and increased fetal morbidity, particularly when more than one abnormality is present on the initial tracing.\r"

Analgesia was induced with intravenous maternal administration of meperidine, 0.8 mg/kg, plus a fixed dose of promethazine (25 mg). The vibratory acoustic stimulus was applied ten minutes after the start of a fetal quiet state, and ten minutes of fetal behavior was observed after application of the stimulus. The number and mean duration of fetal body movements in the unmedicated fetuses were statistically significantly higher than in the medicated group. Similarly, the number of fetal heart rate accelerations was significantly higher in the unmedicated fetuses than in the medicated ones. Ten minutes after VAS no fetus in the unmedicated group was in a quiet behavioral state, while 10 of 12 medicated fetuses (83%) returned to a quiet state.\r"

The findings indicate that the surgeon should apply only one pull on the device for the most secure knot. In addition, there was no strength difference between the suture material itself and the junction of the suture and its plastic tail grip. The plastic tail grip of the PLL will not release the tail end of the suture material before either the suture material or the slip knot fails.\r"

L1210/0 cells incubated for 2 hours with cisplatin progress to the G2 phase of the cell cycle and are arrested there for several days. They then either progress in the cell cycle or die. In cells that eventually die, total transcription, polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNA synthesis, and protein synthesis were markedly inhibited only after 48 hours. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels decreased after 3 days. Cell membrane integrity was lost after 4 days. These results demonstrate that cells can be lethally damaged, yet continue to undergo apparently normal metabolic activities for several days. In a previous study, DNA double-strand breaks were detected after 1 day. We now show that by 2 days, breaks are visible as fragmentation in the nucleosome spacer regions of chromatin. This type of damage is consistent with cell death occurring by the process of apoptosis. Cell shrinkage and morphology were also consistent with this type of cell death. The slow cell death reported here appears to occur at the G2/M transition and may involve events that normally occur at this stage of the cell cycle. These results demonstrate the importance of DNA degradation as an early and possibly essential step in cell death.\r"

For V79 multicell spheroids exposed to VP-16, the external cycling cells were 50 times more sensitive to killing and DNA damage than the internal noncycling cells; the comet assay indicated the fraction of cells resistant to the drug. VPr cells, which were 10 times more resistant to killing and DNA damage by VP-16 than the parent cell line, could also be identified in mixed populations with the use of this method. These results suggest that the comet assay could be useful in predicting tumor cell response to DNA-damaging agents.\r"

In the patients, we found significant (P less than .01) levels of NDMA (mean +/- SD; 201 +/- 111 ng/kg of blood), which is known to be carcinogenic in animals. Five minutes after oral administration of ethanol (0.4 g/kg of body weight), all patients exhibited a significant (P less than .01) rise in blood NDMA levels (338 +/- 125 ng/kg), suggesting continuous endogenous formation of NDMA that was unmasked by ethanol's ability to inhibit first-pass hepatic metabolism of NDMA. In five of six patients, pretreatment with oral ascorbic acid resulted in a blunting, but not statistically significant, effect on maximum blood NDMA levels after consumption of ethanol. Mean levels were 340 +/- 100 ng/kg before treatment with ascorbic acid and 237 +/- 127 ng/kg during treatment. Ethanol administration unmasks increased gastrointestinal formation of NDMA in patients with chronic renal failure. Further studies are required to confirm a possible link between endogenous NDMA formation and the increased incidence of cancer in these patients.\r"

The unique features of the pediatric anatomy in relation to the design of the adult seat restraint as it relates to the vertebral fracture and intra-abdominal injuries are noted. A review of the literature discusses the development of a classification for this flexion-distraction type of vertebral injury, and supports our experience of the increasing frequency of these particular injuries with increasing seatbelt use.\r"

Alcohol consumption is implicated as a major factor in fatal motor vehicle crashes (MVCs), but only poor estimates of blood alcohol concentrations among nonfatally injured crash victims are available. A 3-year study was undertaken at a Regional Trauma Unit to determine the demographics, injury severity, and alcohol positivity of motor vehicle crash victims. Between August 1, 1986 and July 31, 1989, 825 motor vehicle crash victims were available for study; 368 drivers were admitted to the unit within a period of 4 hours. Of 715 patients tested for alcohol, 31.0% were positive. A total of 333 drivers were tested for blood alcohol; 128 (38.4%) were positive. The mean blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at admission for the drivers was 145.6 mg/100 ml; the estimated mean BAC at crash was 180.9 mg/100 ml. The mean age of BAC positive drivers was 31.4 years, compared to a mean age in the BAC negative drivers of 35.2 years (p less than 0.02). Male patients represented 76.6% of the drivers, yet represented 83.6% of the BAC positive drivers (p less than 0.05). There was a marked seasonal variation in BAC positivity, with 46.1% of drivers positive during the summer months. Alcohol appears to be a significant factor in nonfatal MVCs.\r"

We studied this problem using Heat Flux Transducers to directly measure heat exchange between seven exposed volunteers and the environment. Heat exchange by radiation and convection was measured from the anterior chest wall and by conduction, between the back and a thermal mattress (CSZ, Blanketrol II). We determined the coefficients for: radiation = 6.6; convection = 8.3 square root of v; combined radiation and convection = 9.7; conductance = 41, all expressed in W/m2.degrees C. The clinical significance of these results is that heat loss, by radiation and convection alone, is 10 W/m2.degrees C. However, heat production under anaesthesia is only 40 W/m2, so a temperature gradient of greater than 4 degrees C between the skin and environment will cause more heat to be lost than is produced. The thermal mattress can supply 41 W/m2.degrees C, effectively doubling heat production.\r"

A total of 274 adult patients with multiple-system injuries were studied; their demographic data, Trauma Scores (TS) on arrival to the Emergency Room, and Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were reviewed. The TRISS scores and Z and M statistics were then calculated. In the Hamilton group, 106 consecutive patients from April through July 1987 were studied. The majority of patients (72%) were male, and the median age was 26 years. The majority of patients (96.2%) sustained blunt trauma, with motor vehicle accidents (MVA) being the most common (76.4%) mechanisms of injury. Fifty-four (51%) of the patients were transferred from outlying hospitals. The Z and M statistics were -0.05 and 0.92, respectively. In the Ottawa group, 168 consecutive patients from April 1987 through October 1988 were studied. The majority of patients (73%) were male, and the median age was 39 years. Blunt trauma accounted for the majority (91.7%) of injuries, with MVAs being responsible for 58% of injuries. Most patients (63.5%) were transferred from regional hospitals. The Z and M statistics were 1.20 and 0.56, respectively. We conclude that the survival statistics of trauma patients treated at both centres are comparable to those of trauma patients in the MTOS.\r"

The early and late excision groups were matched for age, sex, and size of burn. In survivors, the early excision group had a 32% reduction in mean hospital stay (p less than 0.05). In addition, early surgical excision resulted in fewer episodes of sepsis and pneumonia (p less than 0.05). However, there was no significant improvement in age- and burn size-specific survival in the early excision group (p greater than 0.05). We conclude that elderly patients represent a high-risk population, and that early surgical excision results in fewer episodes of infection and a reduction in hospital stay but does not significantly improve survival.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of widespread application of endoscopic guided percutaneous tracheostomy. Sixty-one consecutive ICU patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation underwent bedside endoscopic guided percutaneous tracheostomy. Using a modified Ciaglia technique, a #6-10 tracheostomy tube was introduced between the second and third tracheal rings. Bronchoscopic transillumination facilitated identification of the appropriate tracheostomy site, and verified satisfactory placement of dilators and tracheostomy tube. There was one procedure-related death due to arrhythmia. Procedure-related complications included (n = 7): bleeding (controlled with local pressure), two infections, two cuff tears, and two obstructions of the tracheal tube. The tracheostomy was eventually removed in 13 patients. Bronchoscopic evaluation of three patients at 4 months post-tracheostomy removal was normal and there has been no clinical evidence suggestive of tracheal stenosis in the remaining ten extubated patients. There was a 50% reduction in cost when compared to operative tracheostomy. Percutaneous tracheostomy is a simple, safe, cost-effective bedside procedure for critically ill ventilator-dependent patients. Endoscopic guidance appears to increase the safety of this procedure and may prevent complications of pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and paratracheal false passage previously reported with blinded percutaneous methods.\r"

Eighteen patients were identified, with an average age of 22 years, and an average followup of 34 months. Fifteen were involved in motor vehicle accidents, with 11 being single-vehicle accidents. Of note, 12 of the 15 were rear seat passengers with lap belts only. Twelve patients suffered abdominal injury, seven requiring operative intervention, mainly for hollow viscus injury. In three patients, a delay of 24 hours or more occurred before recognition of intra-abdominal pathology requiring surgical therapy. One patient had an unrecognized spinal fracture for 2 weeks after abdominal surgery for a perforated viscus. The spinal injury was carefully assessed and analyzed for prognostic factors. Six were graded excellent, five good, four fair, and one poor. One case of paraplegia associated with avulsion of the spinal cord from distraction is reported. Prognostic factors included the amount of facet joint involvement and the degree of initial kyphosis. Those having greater than 17 degrees of kyphosis had a poor prognosis. Early recognition of the constellation of injuries involving the spine and abdomen associated with the use of the lap belt is recommended with surgery to the spinal fracture as outlined.\r"

We have identified a group of 19 children (mean age, 6.3 years) who presented with absent vital signs (VSA) or severe hypotension, unexplained by blood loss, where these findings were caused by injury to the high cervical spine and cord, demonstrated either by X-ray or postmortem examination. Fourteen had radiologic evidence of injury to the spine between C1 and C3. In two patients the bony injury was at the C6-7 level, while in two patients the cervical spine X-ray was normal. Eighteen of the 19 children were initially resuscitated but died from a combination of hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy and cerebral injury. Sixteen patients underwent postmortem examination and in 13 there was evidence of cord laceration, up to and including cord transection. These findings demonstrate a distinct pattern of \"juvenile\" cervical spine injury involving the high spine and cord which results in either apnea and cardiorespiratory arrest, or severe hypotension. This previously unrecognized cause of cardiorespiratory arrest should be considered in all children presenting with VSA after multiple trauma, even when there is no apparent radiologic abnormality of the cervical spine.\r"

To illustrate the usefulness and feasibility of conducting injury surveillance using E-coded hospital discharge data, we examined the surveillance data from the Massachusetts Statewide Childhood Injury Prevention Program. By using E-coded hospital discharge data, we increased the number of cases available for analysis by 40-fold over deaths, and we were able to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of the important causes of nonfatal childhood injuries. We therefore propose the development of a national injury surveillance system based on the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set coded by both the nature of the injury (N Code) and external cause (E Code).\r"

Our infection rate of 1.2% was found to be lower than figures cited in the literature. Conscientious indication of the interlocking nail in these circumstances cannot claim all the credit for these results, the appropriate preoperative management with preventive antibiotics together with excellent operative technique have to be taken into consideration as well. Reviewing these results, we have adopted the opinion that the interlocking nail, when selectively used in the hands of an expert, can be recommended not only in closed fractures but also in Types I and II open fractures of the femur and tibia, provided that the special principles of treatment in a particular case are not neglected.\r"

Of those who were not retired before the injury 59 of 82 (72%) had been able to return to work and most of them were still working at the time of the followup. The main reasons for inability to work were brain and spinal cord injuries, blindness, and 'failure in re-education.' Most complaints arose from sequelae of brain, pelvic, and upper and lower extremity injuries. Only seven patients needed constant medication because of their injuries. We conclude that the treatment of even the most severely injured patients with multiple injuries is certainly worth the effort.\r"

In order to elucidate mechanisms for distant damage in a living body to the peripheral and central nervous system, a model system was designed aimed to create pressure waves with amplitudes, frequency spectrum, and duration fairly comparable to those recorded in situ. Our model system enabled exposure of tissue cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and endothelial cells under strictly controlled conditions to a burst of oscillating pressure waves and to determine possible influence on oxygen consumption. Oscillating pressure waves caused by high-energy missile impact (velocity 1,200 m/s) reduced the oxygen consumption by more than 80%. However, in spite of this drastic, acute effect the ganglion cells and the feeder layer cells did not reveal any immediate plasma membrane dysfunctions as revealed by cytoplasmic uptake of Evans blue protein marker complexes. It is concluded that pressure waves fairly similar to those demonstrable in vivo in the vicinity of the peripheral and central nervous system after high-energy missile extremity impact in pigs reduce the respiration of DRG cells and endothelial cells in culture. The mitochondrial impairment is not associated with concomitant plasma membrane dysfunction for macromolecules. Nerve cells seem to be more vulnerable than the other type of cultured cells examined.\r"

The distinct factors influencing the morbidity and mortality rates are discussed as well as the importance of an aggressive treatment in the initial approach of these patients. The following steps are virtually essential for the achievement of results comparable to those presented in the present protocol: exhaustive irrigation of the perineal wound with saline solution followed by surgical debridement and removal of all devitalized areas, maintenance of the wound open, early maturation transverse colostomy with total fecal flow diversion, periodic surgical revisions at intervals of 24 to 72 hours, large doses of antibiotic therapy, nutritional support with full parenteral feeding, and appropriate management of bone injuries and skin grafts. Adopting of measures proposed in this protocol yielded a decrease in mortality rate from 70% to 31.5%.\r"

  ".W": "In the last 10 years we have treated 28 patients with 33 groin infections involving a common femoral artery anastomosis of prosthetic arterial grafts (2 aortic Dacron grafts, 31 peripheral polytetrafluoroethylene grafts). Management included complete graft preservation for patent infected grafts (11 cases), subtotal excision of occluded infected grafts leaving an oversewn 2 to 3 mm graft remnant attached to a patent artery critical for limb survival (16 cases), and total graft excision with arterial oversewing or ligation for anastomotic bleeding (6 cases). Essential treatment adjuncts included (1) radical operative wound debridement, and (2) secondary revascularization by means of bypasses tunneled via lateral uninfected routes, and unusual approaches to uninvolved patent outflow arteries (i.e., the distal superficial or deep femoral or popliteal arteries) after isolation of the infected wound. Follow-up averaged 3 years (1 to 10 years). This plan of treatment resulted in an 11% (3/28) hospital mortality and an amputation rate of 13% (4/30 threatened limbs). Of the 25 survivors with 30 infected groin grafts, 87% (26) of the wounds healed uneventfully by secondary intention within 1 to 8 weeks (mean, 4 weeks) and have remained healed. One infected groin wound did not heal and required delayed total graft excision. Three patients had late anastomotic disruption with hemorrhage at 8 months, 2 years, and 4 years after initial treatment. This selected use of complete or partial graft preservation and other essential treatment adjuncts are proposed as a safer, easier method for managing infected prosthetic arterial grafts in the groin.\r"

  ".U": "90219259\r", 
  ".W": "The 10-year experience of a single community was reviewed and a multivariate analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of clinical and environmental factors in mortality after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. Ruptured aneurysms were repaired in 243 patients in six area hospitals (one university, five community) by 25 surgeons (16 vascular, 9 general). Overall, 30-day mortality was 55% (133/243). Although the mortality by hospital ranged from 44% to 68%, these differences were not statistically significant. However, significant variations occurred in the mortality rates of individual surgeons, ranging from 44% to 73%. The mortality rate for the vascular surgeons was less than that of the general surgeons, 51% versus 69% (p less than 0.05). Clinical factors were evaluated, and the most significant parameters were systolic blood pressure, presence of chronic obstructive lung disease, and history of chronic renal insufficiency. These results support the implication that the degree of specialization of the surgeon and the preexisting health of the patient are the most important determinants of survival after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The size and sophistication of the hospital appear to be less influential factors.\r"

  ".W": "Associated coronary artery disease is the critical factor that influences early and late mortality after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. Dipyridamole-thallium 201 scintigraphy, left ventricular ejection fraction, and Goldman risk factor analysis have been suggested as preoperative noninvasive screening methods to detect significant coronary artery disease. In this series of 95 elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs dipyridamole-thallium 201 scintigraphy was highly predictive of the absence of perioperative cardiac morbidity (96% specificity, 44/46 normal scans, no cardiac morbidity), whereas ejection fraction (73% specificity, 31/42 normal ejection fraction, no cardiac morbidity) and Goldman risk factor analysis (84% specificity, 44/51 class I, no cardiac morbidity) were less. Furthermore, thallium redistribution on dipyridamole-thallium 201 scintigraphy leading to coronary angiography identified a significant number of patients with occult coronary artery disease who required preoperative coronary revascularization (8%, 8/95) and might have remained undetected on the basis of left ventricular ejection fraction or Goldman risk factor analysis. Finally, fixed thallium deficit, which some investigators have interpreted as a low probability finding for cardiac morbidity, was associated with a higher than expected incidence of cardiac complications. Forty-six percent (7/15) of all postoperative cardiac complications (three myocardial infarctions, three ischemic events, one death) occurred in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms with fixed deficits. This suggests that patients with fixed deficits on dipyridamole-thallium 201 scintigraphy should be considered for later \"delayed\" (4 hours) thallium images or coronary angiography or both.\r"

We undertook a study to determine whether the preferential use of an above-knee expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass graft to save vein is an appropriate option. We reviewed our experience with 114 above-knee expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass reconstructions. Life-table analysis of primary and secondary graft patency was carried out by the method of Peto and statistically analyzed for the influence of clinical indication, runoff as determined by both preoperative and intraoperative completion arteriography, smoking, and diabetes. The 5-year primary patency rate of 57% for patients with claudication was comparable to contemporary randomized or retrospective series with below-knee autogenous vein for that indication, and it was superior to the patency rate for limb salvage. The status of the runoff vessels was an important determinant of outcome. The 59 limbs with good arteriographic runoff (2 to 3 vessels) had a markedly higher 5-year patency rate (70%) than the poor arteriographic runoff (0 to 1 vessels) group (30%). Continued cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus also appeared to affect adversely primary graft patency in our hands. Our data support the use of preferential above-knee expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in patients with good angiographic runoff. This approach does not appear to prejudice the limb against secondary revisionary procedures or the use of a new autogenous graft, if required.\r"

Grafts were assigned to four groups based on the minimum external diameter measured during operation: less than 3.0 mm, n = 18; 3.0 mm, n = 59; 3.5 mm, n = 67; and greater than or equal to 4.0 mm, n = 145. A pattern of increasing graft patency and limb salvage among the four groups was noted as the minimum external diameter increased from less than 3.0 mm to greater than or equal to 4.0 mm. When compared to the larger grafts greater than or equal to 4.0 mm, primary graft patency was significantly lower both for less than 3.0 mm grafts (0% for less than 3.0 mm vs 65% for greater than or equal to 4.0 mm at 3 years, p less than 0.001) and for long (greater than 45 cm) 3.0 mm grafts (38% for long 3.0 mm vs 75% for greater than or equal to 4.0 mm at 2 years, p less than 0.005). All 3.5 mm and short (less than 45 cm) 3.0 mm grafts had patency rates similar to greater than or equal to 4.0 mm veins. Thus long 3.0 mm and all less than 3.0 mm reversed saphenous vein grafts should be considered at high risk for failure. Veins with fibrotic, thick-walled segments identified during operation (n = 19) had patency rates significantly lower than nonfibrotic veins (n = 270; p less than 0.01), and this may play a role in the failure of some less than 3.0 mm minimum external diameter vein grafts.\r"

One hundred seventeen segments were treated in 28 iliac arteries and 89 superficial femoral/popliteal arteries. No tibial arteries were treated. Fifty-two stenoses and 65 occlusions occurred. The procedures were performed percutaneously in 52 patients (55%), and open surgical technique was used in 43 patients (45%). Nine immediate failures (9.5%) and 86 successes (90.5%) were noted within 24 hours of the procedure. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 months with a mean of 3.2 months. Late failures within this time period occurred in 21 patients (22%). The total failure rate was 30/95 or 31.5%. Only one of the patients was made worse by a failed laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Immediate complications consisted of formation of subcutaneous hematoma in 20 of the 52 patients having percutaneous procedures (38%) and healing difficulty in 3 of the 43 patients having open surgical procedures (7%). Hospital stay was usually 1 day longer in the latter group. No patient required surgical intervention for bleeding as a result of a vessel perforation.

The patients were divided into two groups: 83 blacks (140 arteriogram limbs) and 52 whites (87 arteriogram limbs). Disease severity scores between the groups were compared, and the existence of five known risk factors for atherosclerosis were considered for poststratification adjustment.

Some clinicians have recommended universal use of arteriography, whereas others prefer to rely on physical findings alone. To better define our indications for contrast studies, we reviewed clinical data on 306 patients (349 extremities) with penetrating trauma who were admitted during a prior 2-year period (1985 to 1987). Injuries were caused by stab wounds in 50 (14.3%) extremities and by gunshot wounds in 299 (85.7%) extremities. Twenty-seven of the 50 stab wounds (54%) required urgent exploration based on physical findings, whereas 23 underwent arteriography. None of these studies showed unsuspected arterial injury. Twenty-nine of 299 gunshot wounds (9.7%) underwent mandatory exploration, and arteriograms were performed on 270 extremities; findings in 30 studies (11.1%) were positive for unsuspected arterial injuries. Gunshot wounds were categorized according to location and number of arteriograms with positive results. Arteriograms of lateral thigh and upper arm injuries resulted in no positive outcomes. Positive study results were recorded in 22.9% of calf injuries, 20% of forearm and antecubital injuries, 9.5% of popliteal fossa injuries, 9.0% of medial and posterior thigh injuries, and 8.3% of medial and posterior upper arm injuries. We recommend arteriography for penetrating injuries to these high-risk areas. However, clinical evaluation alone is accurate for identification of arterial trauma with lateral thigh or upper arm wounds and stab wounds to the extremities.\r"

A reliable noninvasive diagnostic study may facilitate earlier definitive diagnosis and therapy. Proton magnetic resonance imaging may offer a noninvasive diagnostic alternative. We examined this possibility by using an experimental rabbit model of acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion in this study. Animals were scanned 1 hour after the ischemic insult. Relative intestinal wall signal intensity was increased in experimental (ischemic) animals when compared to sham operated controls on T2-weighted (4.35 +/- 0.5 vs 2.57 +/- 0.31, p less than 0.02) and proton spin density-weighted images (2.1 +/- 0.2 vs 1.4 +/- 0.21, p less than 0.05). Significant increases in image intensity were found on T2-weighted and proton spin density images when compared to control animals. Differences between groups could be further highlighted after the administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent gadolinium diethyltriamine pentacetic acid on T1-weighted images. The data from this preliminary study demonstrate that proton magnetic resonance imaging may be used to discriminate between ischemic and nonischemic small intestine. This noninvasive tool may someday become clinically useful to enhance our diagnostic capabilities when a diagnosis of acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion is being entertained.\r"

However, successful healing of an ulcer with this therapeutic modality is slow and tedious. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether adjunctive sclerotherapy of large venous channels near the ulcers enhances healing. Twenty-eight patients with perimalleolar venous ulceration were entered into this study. Ulcer size ranged from 6.0 to 25 cm2. All were examined for the presence of large venous channels adjacent to the ulcer bed. A portable continuous-wave Doppler supplemented digital examination of the area. Twenty-five out of 28 patients had easily detectable venous channels, and these were randomized into two groups: group I, treated by weekly changes of Unna's compressive boots; group II, treated by weekly change of Unna's compressive boots and sclerotherapy with 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate (Sotradecol). All patients had the size of the ulcer measured during their weekly visits. Patients in group II took a mean of 2.1 weeks to exhibit 50% healing and 4.3 weeks to fully heal. Conversely patients in group I took a mean of 3.2 weeks to achieve 50% healing and 6.1 weeks to fully heal. Thus, healing was significantly faster (p less than 0.05) in group II. In conclusion, the therapeutic efficiency of Unna's compressive bandaging is significantly enhanced by the adjunctive sclerotherapy of adjacent venous channels.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation resulting in intimal hyperplasia is a major cause of late graft failure. In baboons, healing 60 microns internodal distance polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts form an intima composed of proliferating smooth muscle cells with a luminal lining of endothelium. The presence of intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation underneath an intact endothelium, without platelet adherence, suggests that intimal cells rather than platelets may provide the growth factors regulating the smooth muscle cell proliferation. This idea is supported by the observation that, when segments of graft and artery are excised and perfused ex vivo, there is greater mitogenic activity present in the graft perfusate compared to artery perfusate. Two factors expressed by vascular wall cells and known to influence smooth muscle cell growth in vitro are platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta 1. The expression of these growth factors was measured by Northern blot analysis of total ribonucleic acid extracted from thoracic aorta and the intima of 6-week thoracoabdominal polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, and from smooth muscle cell cultured from the aorta and polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Growth of the cultured smooth muscle cell was arrested in serum-free conditions for 3 days and then stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four hours later, the smooth muscle cells were harvested. Probing the blots for platelet-derived growth factor-A, platelet-derived growth factor-B, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid revealed that in vivo, the graft intima expressed more platelet-derived growth factor-A than the aorta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Chronic venous insufficiency is a frequent sequel to lower extremity venous thrombosis. A relatively uncommon, but potentially lethal, cause of the thrombosis is congenital antithrombin III deficiency. Recognition and treatment of this occult deficiency is critical. The following report describes a family treated by the authors for this problem. In one generation of nine siblings, three males had documentation of the disease with functional antithrombin III levels in the range of 50% to 60%. Before evaluation for the deficiency one female sibling died at the age of 20 years as a consequence of a proven pulmonary embolus. Antithrombin III levels in another female sibling, who was free of symptoms, were normal (80% to 120%). Four other siblings who were free of symptoms (one female, three males) refused evaluation. All three men with the deficiency had severe, chronic, bilateral, lower extremity, venous insufficiency manifested by pain, varicosities, edema, pigmentation, and ulceration. Despite chronic warfarin therapy, one experienced recurrent pulmonary embolization with eventual loss of perfusion of the entire right lung. Ascending venography in the symptomatic males with the deficiency revealed evidence of recurrent and diffuse venous thrombosis with partial recanalization. Recurrent lower extremity venous thrombosis consequent to antithrombin III deficiency causes a particularly fulminant postphlebitic syndrome with characteristic venographic findings. Although potentially lethal if unrecognized and treated simply as venous insufficiency, chronic therapy with warfarin offers palliation and prolongs life.\r"

  ".U": "90219275\r", 
  ".W": "Complement activation by biomaterials may play an important role in vascular graft failure since the physiologically active polypeptides, C3a and C5a, have several relevant properties. C3a promotes platelet aggregation and release, and C5a activates neutrophils, which may stimulate platelet aggregation by liberation of platelet activating factor or by a direct neutrophil platelet interaction. Microscopic air bubbles (nuclei) are found in the surface roughness or pores of most biomaterials, and their number and size are related to the surface tension of the material. Therefore two interfaces can be postulated to exist when Dacron is exposed to blood: (1) a blood/biomaterial, and (2) a blood/air interface. These air nuclei in the surface and the biomaterial itself are capable of activating complement. The purpose of these experiments was to eliminate these surface nuclei from Dacron by a process termed denucleation and subsequently to determine the effect of this intervention on complement activation and platelet aggregation in vitro. Dacron was denucleated by pretreatment that involved serial rinsing with ethanol and degassed buffer that results in replacement of the air nuclei by buffer. Both control and denucleated pieces of Dacron (2, 4, and 6 cm2) were then incubated in human plasma. Each plasma sample was assayed for complement activation products (C3a, C5a, and C4a) by means of radioimmunoassays, and the degree of autologous platelet aggregation that resulted from the addition of a portion of each incubated plasma sample to an autologous platelet suspension was measured. There was a significant reduction in C3a and C5a in the plasma samples incubated with denucleated Dacron as compared to control Dacron (p less than 0.001, analysis of variance [ANOVA]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven men had a maculopapular rash and 3 had palatal ulcers. At esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy), multiple discrete esophageal ulcers measuring 0.3 to 1.5 cm in diameter were observed. Electron microscopy of biopsy specimens taken from the ulcer margins in 8 men revealed viral particles 120 to 160 nm in diameter whose morphologic characteristics were those of retroviruses. Human immunodeficiency virus seroconversion was documented in 15 men by Western blot analysis. In 3 men, HIV-1 was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in 2 men HIV-1 was isolated from peripheral blood monocytes, and in 1 man HIV-1 was isolated from tissue taken from the margins of the esophageal ulcers. These observations extend our knowledge of the clinical spectrum of acute HIV infection syndromes and suggest that cells in the esophagus are a target for HIV-1 infection.\r"

This report describes and compares the seasonal variation in asthma hospitalizations and mortality in the US population. During 1982 through 1986, both mortality and hospitalizations demonstrated periodic seasonal trends that were age specific and did not differ by sex, race, or region. For persons aged 5 through 34 years, hospitalizations peaked in September through November, whereas mortality trends peaked in June through August. A disproportionate number of the summer deaths in this age group occurred out of the hospital. For individuals 65 years old or older, both asthma hospitalizations and mortality demonstrated increases during December through February. The results of this study demonstrate age-specific seasonal variations in the clinical expression of asthma. Perhaps the treatment and prevention of asthma hospitalizations and mortality might be improved through further understanding of these trends.\r"

The overall detected error rate was 3.13 errors for each 1000 orders written and a rate of 1.81 significant errors per 1000 orders. The error rate (4.01 per 1000 orders) was greatest between 12 pm and 3:59 pm. First-year postgraduate residents were found to have a higher error rate (4.25 per 1000 orders) than other prescriber classes, and obstetrics/gynecology services (3.54 per 1000 orders) and surgery/anesthesia services (3.42 per 1000 orders) had greater error rates than other services. The study results demonstrate the significant risk to patients from medication prescribing errors. Educational, operational, and risk-management activities should include efforts directed at reducing the risk to patients from prescribing errors.\r"

Biopsies performed for a mass yielded a 20.8% (130/626) incidence of cancer; and for calcification, 16.9% (107/635). The biopsy results were supported by the interpretations of four radiologists (J.E.M., P.C.S., and M.R.S.) who were practicing at Brigham and Women's Hospital in 22.2% of the total (280), whereas the remaining 981 lesions were discovered on mammograms that were performed and interpreted elsewhere and were referred to our hospital for surgical consultation. The biopsy results of the mammograms from other facilities yielded a positive predictive value of 16.7% (164/981) vs 26.1% (73/280) for the Brigham and Women's Hospital group. This statistically significant difference lends support to the value of a second opinion in patients with biopsy recommendations for occult breast lesions, especially when findings are inconclusive.\r"

Animals were fed their respective diets ad libitum for 1 week and then killed. Quantitative culture of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and cecum was performed to determine bacterial translocation from the gut. A 66% translocation rate (10/15) of bacteria to MLN was observed in the animals fed Ensure and Enrich compared to 21% in the Vivonex TEN group (3/14) and 20% in the animals fed Ensure plus ground corn cobs (3/15). None of the animals in the control group eating their normal diets of rat chow and water developed positive MLN. Statistical significance (p less than 0.001) was achieved between the Ensure and Enrich groups when compared to controls but not between the Vivonex TEN and Ensure plus corn cobs. Cecal culture revealed a statistically significant rise in cecal bacteria in all groups when compared to the control group (group I). These results indicate that chemically defined liquid diets result in altered intestinal microflora and bacterial translocation from the gut.\r"

One particular lymphokine, Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is central to the generation of most immune responses including those with antitumor activity. Prompted by two clinical trials which have suggested distinct but apparently opposite effects of lipid emulsions on the production of and lymphocyte responses to IL-2 we have examined the effects of pharmacological concentrations of three lipid emulsions currently in clinical use on IL-2 related interactions in vitro. Mitogen-stimulated and IL-2 activated human lymphocyte proliferation were both inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of all three lipid emulsions although the effects were less marked with the solution in which 50% of the calories are present as medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) rather than long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Similarly the LCT, but less so the MCT-containing solutions inhibited the generation of cytotoxic lymphokine-activated killer cells. These solutions did not inhibit the proliferation of cell lines which are not growth-factor dependent but did inhibit the growth of an IL-2-dependent cell line. We conclude that lipid emulsions can upset IL-2-dependent lymphocyte responses. These observations may lead to parenteral feeding regimens which are less immunocompromising for the tumor-bearing patient.\r"

Noninfectious complications occurred with 54 (38%) of the catheters, resulting in 17 (12%) removals. Successful interventions included catheter repair, dissolving precipitates with ammonium chloride solution, and declotting catheter lumens with heparin and/or urokinase. We conclude that RACs continue to be reliable and safe devices to use in marrow transplant patients. Complications interfering with catheter function are frequent; however, most can be resolved without the need to remove the catheter.\r"

  ".W": "Although weight loss is a common problem in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the precise cause of malnutrition in COPD patients is not known. The purpose of this study was to measure and compare resting energy expenditure (REE) in stable undernourished and adequately nourished COPD. REE was measured in normal, adequately nourished, and undernourished COPD patients by indirect calorimetry and then compared to predicted basal metabolic rate (BMR) calculated from the Harris-Benedict equation. We found that measured REE, compared to predicted, was significantly higher in the undernourished group, (1.15 +/- 0.02) and compared to the adequately nourished COPD (0.99 +/- 0.03) and normal groups (0.93 +/- 0.02) (p less than 0.0001). We conclude that there is a hypermetabolic state in stable malnourished COPD patients which may be a factor in weight loss. This elevated REE also needs to be taken into account when determining caloric requirements for COPD patients.\r"

  ".W": "The correction or maintenance of blood and tissue alpha-tocopherol (alpha-Toc) levels by intraperitoneally administered all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (alpha-Tac) was compared with RRR- alpha-tocopherol (alpha-Toc) in vitamin E-depleted and control rats. Rats received 1.3 TE vitamin E daily for 7 days. alpha-Tac was detected in plasma of one-third of alpha-Tac-treated rats 24 hr after the first treatment, although not in subsequent samplings. Both alpha-Tac and alpha-Toc increased tocopherol levels in plasma and liver of E-deprived rats, while little or no change was observed in adipose tissue and brain. Similarly, control rats treated with alpha-Tac or alpha-Toc had significantly greater (p less than 0.05) plasma and liver alpha-Toc levels at day 3 and day 7 than did saline-treated rats. There was no significant difference in adipose alpha-Toc levels among treatment groups of control rats. The results of this study suggest that alpha-Tac is rapidly hydrolyzed to its biologically active alcohol form and results in similar effects to that of intraperitoneally administered alpha-Toc.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of surgical trauma on serum trace elements was studied in 10 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. After the initial decrease due to the hemodilution during operation serum iron, zinc, copper and selenium remained depressed for the immediate postoperative period. Zinc was still at significantly lower level 2 months after the operation. Low serum iron values were also observed. Changes in trace element concentrations were parallel with changes in the concentrations of their transport and binding proteins in the serum. The multielemental technique also measured nonessential bromide, which returned to initial levels in 7 days. Effects of trauma on metabolism, acute phase reaction with redistribution of zinc and copper and losses via increased urinary excretion explain the above changes. Development of a subclinical deficiency of zinc and possibly iron is suggested by the persistence of low serum levels during recovery after operation.\r"
