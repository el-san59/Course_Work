No patent parasitemia could be detected on thick blood films of monkeys immunized with the merozoite surface antigens; however, only one of three monkeys immunized with the rhoptry proteins was partially protected, while two required drug therapy. The experiment clearly demonstrates that the merozoite surface-coat precursor protein can completely protect Aotus monkeys against a lethal infection of the human malaria parasite.\r"

In addition, a class of neurites seen in brain regions containing NFT and SP were also specifically stained. Cross-reactivity of the ubiquitin antisera for tau protein, neurofilament proteins, and high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were ruled out by (i) the inability of the ubiquitin antisera to stain these proteins in immunoblotting experiments and (ii) the inability of tau, neurofilament, and MAP preparations, when preincubated with the ubiquitin antisera, to inhibit the selective neurofibrillar staining observed. Our results are consistent with the suggestion that ubiquitin is covalently associated with the insoluble neurofibrillary material of NFT and SP. We propose that the ubiquitin-mediated degradative pathway may be ineffective in removing these fibrillar structures in Alzheimer disease brain.\r"

A surface electrical property (the zeta potential) was evaluated, and a positive correlation was found in which 5-hour adherence properties increased as the zeta potential became more positive. The following materials were tested: nylon-silicone composite (Z = -24.8 mV), Biobrane (Z = -15.2 mV), fresh-frozen porcine skin (Z = +12.5 mV), Opsite (Z = +14.9 mV), human amnion (Z = +18.2 mV), and human skin (Z = +23.0 mV). This order was also followed for increasing adherence values at 5 hours, which ranged from a low of 48.9 gm/cm2 for the nylon-silicone composite to a high of 88 gm/cm2 for human skin. Also determined was that both adherence and zeta potential decreased as increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde were used to cross-link fresh-frozen porcine skin. Values ranged from a maximum of 85.5 gm/cm2 (0% glutaraldehyde; Z = +12.5 mV) to a minimum of 42.5 gm/cm2 (10% glutaraldehyde; Z = -26.4 mV). Additionally, deliberate biochemical modifications of porcine skin were undertaken in an attempt to increase zeta potential and adherence.\r"

Abnormal Doppler flow and abnormal response of the common femoral vein to the Valsalva maneuver enabled thrombi to be detected only in the common femoral and iliac veins.

The cause of this pelvocalyceal dilatation is often not apparent, although urinary tract obstruction is the most important condition to be excluded. One of the many hypothetical explanations for minimal fetal renal pyelectasis suggests that aggressive maternal hydration before sonography leads to fetal diuresis with resultant pelvocalyceal dilatation. In this study, 20 pregnant volunteers underwent sonography after 10-12 hours of dehydration, after which 1,000 ml of fluid was administered and repeat sonography was performed. Despite a significant increase in the state of maternal hydration as determined by a decrease in urine specific gravity, there was no significant change in the degree of fetal renal pyelectasis before and after hydration. Therefore, pelvocalyceal dilatation identified prenatally should not be attributed to maternal hydration.\r"

Ten fetuses had Down syndrome by karyotype and four of these (40%) had thickened soft tissues (6 mm or more) at the back of the neck or occiput. When these data are combined with those in series previously reported by the authors, similarly collected consecutively, total second-trimester fetuses studied equals 3,825.

Although the mechanisms of subendocardial ischemia remain to be fully defined, they are clearly associated with the transmural distribution of intramyocardial systolic pressures. Even though almost all the myocardium is perfused in diastole, a reduction of diastolic perfusion pressure or duration will result in subendocardial ischemia. The factors that produce subendocardial ischemia are all associated with a reduction or loss of coronary flow reserve, and as our ability to measure flow reserve in humans improves, it is likely that we will be able to select medical or surgical therapy that will minimize or abolish subendocardial ischemia. For example, it will someday become possible to choose a time for valve replacement in an asymptomatic patient to obtain maximal protection of the myocardium or to select the right combination of therapies for the immediate post-operative period so that as much myocardium as possible will be spared. The more we learn to understand the mechanisms of subendocardial ischemia, the sooner will we be able to achieve these desired ends.\r"

A review of the literature shows that a number of common and uncommon gram-negative and gram-positive organisms susceptible to TMP-SMZ are frequently resistant to cephalosporins. TMP-SMZ has, in addition to its exceptional microbiologic activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics that make it a potentially cost-effective alternative to third-generation cephalosporins in the treatment of serious hospital-acquired infections caused by susceptible organisms.\r"

  ".W": "Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) has traditionally been employed as an oral formulation for infections in ambulatory pediatric patients. However, therapeutic concentrations of TMP and SMZ in serum and CSF are more consistently attained after intravenous administration. Serum half-life increases with the age of the child, and few significant toxic effects are observed with intravenous administration. Either the necessity to optimize bioavailability because of the underlying seriousness of disease or a desire to avoid other drugs that may be responsible for adverse reactions or hypersensitivity should direct the clinician to administer an intravenous preparation. Serious pediatric infections that might warrant the consideration of intravenous TMP-SMZ include shigellosis, salmonellosis, typhoid fever, nocardiosis, gram-negative bacillary septicemia or meningitis, and infections due to Pneumocystis carinii and malarial parasites. Infections due to Listeria will respond to TMP-SMZ, and infections due to Citrobacter diversus, Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum are especially susceptible to TMP-SMZ.\r"

A comparative study involving 126 episodes of fever showed a higher rate of response to a TMP-SMZ-carbenicillin regimen than to a gentamicin-carbenicillin combination (85% vs. 69%, respectively, P less than or equal to .04). In another study TMP-SMZ was used after unsuccessful therapy with the combination of an antipseudomonal penicillin and an aminoglycoside; 54% of the 35 patients treated orally and 49% of 86 treated intravenously responded to TMP-SMZ regimens. Other studies document successful results with TMP-SMZ used in combination with either an aminoglycoside or an antipseudomonal penicillin. TMP-SMZ has a role in the treatment of infections due to gram-negative bacilli in immunocompromised hosts, particularly when the infecting agent is not Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is resistant to moxalactam but susceptible to gentamicin.\r"

Before AIDS, TMP-SMZ was at least as effective as pentamidine in pediatric and adult populations and was notably less toxic. In a study prospectively comparing TMP-SMZ with pentamidine in patients with AIDS, the toxicity associated with either therapy was very high, a problem suggesting a need for the development of additional types of therapy. There was no difference in the clinical responses to the different therapeutic regimens; the majority of patients showed some improvement. The rates of both major and minor toxic reactions were similar in the two groups, although the reactions differed qualitatively. In patients with AIDS rash was frequently associated with TMP-SMZ therapy and was almost never associated with pentamidine therapy. Neutropenia was common with both drugs. Pentamidine may produce hypoglycemia, which, though infrequent, may be life threatening. Neutropenia and rash are two adverse effects of TMP-SMZ therapy being described with great frequency in patients with AIDS. Mild neutropenia is common in patients with AIDS, even when therapy is not being administered. The high rate of toxic reactions limits the usefulness of TMP-SMZ for routine prophylaxis.\r"

  ".U": "87205794\r", 
  ".W": "Several major factors have contributed to the current availability of highly successful techniques for the management of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in female patients. Since UTI cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone, greater accuracy in diagnostic techniques that establish whether bacteria in the voided urine are present in the bladder urine is the most important factor. Second, the recognition that almost all recurrent UTIs are reinfections is crucial. Third, it has been observed that bacteriuria in female patients is preceded by colonization of the introital mucosa of the vagina and urethra with Enterobacteriaceae from the rectal flora; it is at these sites that oral antimicrobial agents can determine the character of subsequent reinfections of the urinary tract. A fourth factor is the development of highly effective prophylactic regimens, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, cinoxacin, and cephalexin. In addition, the management of patients with UTI has improved because correctable causes of bacterial persistence are now well recognized and there is an improved understanding of the kinds of patients at increased risk. Finally, new antimicrobial agents with more favorable pharmacokinetic properties have become available.\r"

There is some evidence that TMP-SMZ may be effective prophylactically in biliary surgery (in patients with functioning gall bladders). Further study is needed to clarify the mixed results seen in prostatic and pelvic surgery. An evaluation was made of the effectiveness of TMP-SMZ in the prevention of endomyometritis following cesarean section in 206 women who were comparable in terms of risk factors. Among patients given a placebo, a total of 44 infections (42%) occurred, whereas among those given TMP-SMZ prophylaxis, 22 infections (22%) occurred, a statistically significant difference (P = .037, chi 2). The rate of endomyometritis among placebo recipients was 33%, as contrasted with one of 19% in those given TMP-SMZ (P = .02, chi 2). Prophylactic treatment resulted in lower rates of endomyometritis in both high- and low-risk women, but the results reached statistical significance only among high-risk patients. In essence, prophylaxis changed high-risk patients into low-risk patients.\r"

A subgroup of these gene products appears to be nonessential for virus replication in cell culture, but contributes to the complex life cycle of the virus in the host. To identify such functions, a simple insertional mutagenesis method has been used for selective inactivation of individual HSV-1 genes. The bacterial transposon Tn5 was allowed to insert randomly into cloned restriction fragments representing the entire short unique (US) region of the HSV-1 genome. Of the 12 open reading frames that were mutagenized with Tn5, mutant derivatives of US2, US4, and US5 were recombined into the virus. These three genes proved to be nonessential for HSV-1 replication in Vero (African Green monkey kidney) cells and the US4 gene appeared to be involved in viral pathogenesis in the central nervous system of mice. This rapid mutagenesis procedure should prove useful in exploring the entire HSV-1 genome as well as the genomes of other complex animal viruses.\r"

  ".W": "Large amounts of zinc are present in synaptic vesicles of mammalian central excitatory boutons and may be released during synaptic activity, but the functional significance of the metal for excitatory neurotransmission is currently unknown. Zinc (10 to 1000 micromolar) was found to have little intrinsic membrane effect on cortical neurons, but invariably produced a zinc concentration-dependent, rapid-onset, reversible, and selective attenuation of the membrane responses to N-methyl-D-aspartate, homocysteate, or quinolinate. In contrast, zinc generally potentiated the membrane responses to quisqualate or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate and often did not affect the response to kainate. Zinc also attenuated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated neurotoxicity but not quisqualate or kainate neurotoxicity. The ability of zinc to specifically modulate postsynaptic neuronal responses to excitatory amino acid transmitters, reducing N-methyl-to-aspartate receptor-mediated excitation while often increasing quisqualate receptor-mediated excitation, is proposed to underlie its normal function at central excitatory synapses and furthermore could be relevant to neuronal cell loss in certain disease states.\r"

  ".W": "Mammalian X-chromosome inactivation involves a coordinate shutting down of physically linked genes. Several proposed models require the presence of specific sequences near genes to permit the spread of inactivation into these regions. If such models are correct, one might predict that heterologous genes transferred onto the X chromosome might lack the appropriate signal sequences and therefore escape inactivation. To determine whether a foreign gene inserted into the X chromosome is subject to inactivation, transgenic mice harboring 11 copies of the complete, 17-kilobase chicken transferrin gene on the X chromosome were used. Male mice hemizygous for this insert were bred with females bearing Searle's translocation, an X-chromosome rearrangement that is always active in heterozygous females (the unrearranged X chromosome is inactive). Female offspring bearing the Searle's translocation and the chicken transferrin gene had the same amount of chicken transferrin messenger RNA in liver as did transgenic male mice or transgenic female mice lacking the Searle's chromosome. This result shows that the inserted gene is not subject to X-chromosome inactivation and suggests that the inactivation process cannot spread over 187 kilobases of DNA in the absence of specific signal sequences required for inactivation.\r"

Moreover, the ability of D2 agonists to induce changes in basal ganglia single unit activity and spontaneous motor activity is dependent upon the presence of endogenous dopamine to stimulate D1 receptors; in rats treated with alpha-methyl-rho-tyrosine to reduce endogenous dopamine levels, the neurophysiological and behavioral effects of the D2 agonist quinpirole are significantly attenuated, while the effects of nonselective agonists like apomorphine, which stimulate both D1 and D2 receptors, or combinations of a D2 agonist and a D1 agonist are not attenuated. Thus, the previously held view that D2 receptors alone are responsible for evoking the changes in behavior and basal ganglia output induced by nonselective dopamine agonists and endogenous dopamine is not supported by these results, which indicate that these phenomena require concurrent stimulation of both dopamine receptor subtypes.\r"

The inhibition was dose-dependent and specific since (i) the same antibody had no effect on progesterone-induced maturation, (ii) immunoprecipitation and Western blotting indicated that the antibody recognized a single protein of molecular weight 21,000 in oocyte extracts, and (iii) inhibition was not observed with identical concentrations of normal immunoglobulin. Thus, p21 appears to be involved in mediating insulin-induced maturation of Xenopus oocytes.

Test results from the four in vitro assays did not show significant differences in individual concordance with the rodent carcinogenicity results; the concordance of each assay was approximately 60 percent. Within the limits of this study there was no evidence of complementarity among the four assays, and no battery of tests constructed from these assays improved substantially on the overall performance of the Salmonella assay. The in vitro assays which represented a range of three cell types and four end points did show substantial agreement among themselves, indicating that chemicals positive in one in vitro assay tended to be positive in the other in vitro assays.\r"

From a very small nidus of experienced physicians, this organization expanded to supervise thousands of officers, to build many huge hospitals, and to expend millions of dollars. The Medical Department also experienced some administrative failures, the most obvious of which were the failure to vaccinate against smallpox and the inability to control the loss of manpower associated with medical furlough. Like all institutions, the Medical Department produced both successes and failures. The fact that the South lost the War Between the States tends to obscure the successes and emphasize the failures.\r"

Methylmethacrylate cement was pressed into position centrally to surround the posterior spinous processes and cerclage wire), Combination 2 fusions (application of the same volume of graft used in the bone fusions, over the facet joints. Methylmethacrylate cement was applied as in the Combination 1 fusions). For each preparation, six animals survived 2 weeks or 3 months. All had monthly lateral cervical radiographs. At the appropriate times, they were killed and their C4-C5 segments excised and studied mechanically and histologically. At 2 weeks all of the above preparations were mechanically inferior to normal C4-C5 segments in respect to at least one of the parameters studied. At 3 months, the bone fusions and both combination fusions had developed sufficient mechanical stability so that they were equivalent to normal segments. At this time, the PMMA fusions remained inferior to the \"normals.\" The mechanical data for the PMMA and both combination fusions was corroborated by the histology which demonstrated a fibrosynovial layer between the cement masses and underlying posterior element bone. In the 3-month combination fusions, the lateral aspects of the posterior elements had been spanned by a fusion mass. Clinical relevance: Previously, the authors defined some of the problems associated with constructs modeled by their PMMA fusions. This work confirms the previous research. It also demonstrates that ultimate spinal stability is produced by combination constructs. Because of the 2-week mechanical data, it is recommended that when combination constructs are used clinically, the patient's neck be protected by an external orthosis in the early postoperative period.\r"

All patients were 20 years or older at the time of surgery and none had undergone a prior surgical procedure. Indications for surgery included pain, progressive deformity, and pulmonary symptoms. All patients had a posterior spinal fusion with Harrington instrumentation and autogenous iliac bone graft, with the addition of segmental wiring in only eight. No patient had an anterior fusion or fusion to the sacrum. Follow-up averaged 3.5 years (range: 2-7 years). The average correction at the time of surgery was 38%, and 32% at the time of last follow-up. Seventy-nine percent of the patients reported complete relief of the symptom(s) for which they had surgery. There were 34 complications in 30 (33%) patients. Pseudarthrosis occurred in 14 (15%), requiring 15 additional procedures to achieve a solid arthrodesis. Urinary tract infection occurred in 8 (9%) patients and Harrington hook dislodgement in 5 (5%). One patient sustained a partial paraparesis with recovery to a minimal deficit. No deaths occurred. Although largely successful, posterior fusion with Harrington instrumentation for adult scoliosis has a significant incidence of pseudarthrosis and instrumentation problems.\r"

The one year actuarial patient survival rate and pancreatic graft survival rate were 86 and 66 per cent, respectively. Thirteen pancreatic grafts are presently functioning (two to seven months) and all of the recipients are insulin-free. Although graft cold ischemia time was kept low (a mean of 4.6 hours), a moderate graft pancreatitis developed with a peak serum amylase level of 16.8 +/- 2.2 microkatal per liter. Analysis of the fluid drained through an abdominal drain tube placed at the graft site revealed an amylase activity of 280 +/- 110 microkatal per liter on the first postoperative day and rapidly decreasing to a mean of 15 +/- 5 microkatal per liter on day 6. A pancreatic duct catheter was used to divert the exocrine juice to the exterior during the first few postoperative weeks thereby promoting healing of the pancreaticoenteric anastomosis. The volume of pancreatic juice from the ductal catheter was quite low in the first postoperative days but then rose to reach a plateau level of 500 to 600 milliliters. The amylase activity and the lipase concentration in the pancreatic juice was very high (9,100 +/- 2,450 microkatal per liter and 11.1 +/- 4.4 grams per liter, respectively) during the first postoperative day but then gradually decreased to reach a steady level after four to seven days. Intravenous administration of secretin induced a sixfold increase in the flow of pancreatic juice. An intravenous infusion of somatostatin significantly reduced the flow of pancreatic juice and the amylase activity and lipase concentration in the juice but did not abolish the secretin induced increase in pancreatic secretion.\r"

The placebo group received saline solution intravenously. The rate of infectious complications was recorded. Immunologic tests used at least weekly were: white blood cell counts, OKT4 to OKT8 ratios, lymphocyte blastogenesis and neutrophil bactericidal index. There were no differences noted in patient mortality, infectious complications or antibiotic use. There were two significant differences noted among the immunologic tests. First, there was a decreased lymphocyte blastogenic response in the treated group at two weeks after injury without a difference in T4 to T8 ratios.

Patients who received 2 grams of cefotetan intravenously at the time of appendectomy and those who did not were compared for the incidence of infection. All patients received 1 gram of metronidazole per rectum preoperatively and every 12 hours for five days postoperatively. Infection occurred in three patients who received cefotetan and 16 of those who did not (p less than 0.01). We conclude that a single dose of cefotetan, an antibiotic which is effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms, produces a significant reduction in the incidence of infection when added to metronidazole in the management of patients after appendectomy.\r"

Specific operations, such as abdominal aortic aneurysmorrhaphy and sigmoid colectomy, which can potentially interfere with blood flow in the meandering mesenteric artery, are discussed in an attempt to prevent postoperative necrosis of any portion of the intestine that may have deficient mesenteric blood flow.\r"

Computed tomography scan is performed preoperatively with three markers placed on the nasion and ears. At surgery, after fixing the patient's head and the sensor arm, sampling of the standard points was done to translate the position of the tip of the sensor arm onto the CT images displayed on a computer screen. In this way positional data from conventional preoperative CT scan can be directly transferred into the surgical field. This system has the unique feature of introducing CT-guided stereotaxis into conventional open neurosurgery.\r"

This is especially so since the development of refractive surgery, where good uncorrected vision is frequently the final arbiter of success. We have progressed to the stage where the optic manipulation of the cornea, whether intentional or otherwise, can be understood in terms of a number of variables. These include the preparation and closure of the surgical wound, the choice of suture material, and both intraoperative and postoperative manipulations. Where these have failed and postoperative astigmatism still occurs, a number of surgical procedures are available to reduce the astigmatic error to an acceptable level.\r"

Flaps have functional and aesthetic advantages over skin grafts in that they provide a better color and texture match to the thick periorbital skin.

The four basic groups of skin flaps are the sliding flap, advancement flap, rotation flap, and transposition flap. Selected standard and modified designs of each group are illustrated, and each surgical technique is described in stepwise fashion. The specific applications of the flaps to periorbital reconstruction are emphasized. The indications for use of various skin flaps, the local factors involved in flap selection, and proper preoperative planning are also discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87206619\r", 
  ".W": "The conventional pathogenesis of varicose veins and their subsequent development is essentially based on primary valvular insufficiency of the main saphenous trunk and incompetence of the perforating veins. In contrast, the concept of the pathogenesis of varicose veins presented in this review is based on the presence of arteriovenous (AV) shunting that occurs primarily in the venous tributaries and rarely in the main trunks of the saphenous system. Identification of arteriovenous communications (AVCs) with varicose veins has been documented by visual observation during surgery and especially by use of high-powered microscopes or magnifying lenses. The AVCs have been found consistently to originate subfascially and to terminate in tributaries extrafascially, thus bypassing the capillary network. By means of serial arteriography it was shown that in more than 80% of varicose veins there is premature venous opacification. By means of Doppler ultrasonography, it was demonstrated that AV shunting was present in 80% of the cases. A correlative study of these parameters has shown that the initial significant pathology in varicose veins is mostly confined to the tributaries, although at an advanced stage the main trunk may also be subsequently affected to a lesser degree. In terms of management, these data strongly imply that sclerotherapy or surgical treatment (ligation or excision) should be confined to the tributaries and that high saphenofemoral ligation and stripping should be avoided except in cases where evidence shows valvular involvement and incompetency of the latter. As a result, this study strongly suggests that one could most often spare the main trunk of the saphenous vein for eventual use as a vascular graft.\r"

Fifteen of 18 patients undergoing guided needle aspiration had persistent fevers (greater than 38.3 degrees C). The three afebrile patients all had abdominal pain and leukocytosis, and two of the three also had elevated serum amylase levels. Percutaneous aspiration was guided by CT in 14 patients and by US in four. On the basis of aspirate Gram stains and cultures, as well as surgical (15) and percutaneous drainage (1) findings, the final diagnosis was pancreatic abscess in nine patients, infected pseudocyst in four, uninfected pseudocyst in four, and cystadenoma in one. Diagnosis based on percutaneous aspiration was correct in 17 of 18 patients (94%), and no complications could be directly attributed to the procedure. We conclude that CT- or US-guided percutaneous aspiration is a safe and accurate diagnostic procedure for patients with peripancreatic fluid collections in whom secondary infection is suspected.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of the patency of the pancreaticojejunostomy was conducted in four patients who had undergone Whipple's procedure. Three patients had a mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis, and in one patient the pancreatic remnant had been invaginated into the jejunal loop. The longest interval between the operation and the present study was 9.7 years. After intravenous infusion of secretin (1 microgram/kg), the temporal changes in the pancreatic ductal caliber were measured by means of either ultrasonography (two patients) or computed tomography (two patients). The presence of adequate functional pancreatic tissue was assumed in all four patients on the basis of their clinical status and the normal ductal caliber before the secretin provocation. In two patients, the ductal system showed an initial dilatation following secretin administration and then gradually emptied. There were no changes of the Wirsung duct in the other two patients. These data suggest that the pancreaticojejunal anastomoses were patent in all four patients but had different degrees of stenosis. The present method allows a safe and noninvasive evaluation of the anastomosis in vivo. Since long-term patency of the pancreaticojejunostomy is feasible, it should be attempted whenever possible in patients undergoing Whipple's procedure.\r"

This patient was first treated with evacuation and cyst excision. Recurrence was noted after 20 months, and an excision of the cyst and a segment of the common femoral artery with graft interposition was required. At gross examination, the cyst was unilocular and contained gelatinous material. The cyst appeared to be situated in the tunica adventitia and did not communicate with the vascular lumen. No synovial lining was present. Histologically, it was similar to a ganglion cyst with contents rich in hyaluronic acid. A review of the literature was undertaken to determine the results of treating this lesion. The disease is rare. All senior authors of case reports were contacted to construct follow-up information. A high incidence of recurrence was noted in patients treated by evacuation and cyst excision. We believe that total cyst excision with the involved artery and graft interposition at the femoral site can be done easily, safely, and with virtually no chance for recurrence.\r"

Fourteen patients were treated conservatively without drainage, and 12 had resolution of symptoms without interference. Ultrasonograms in the remaining nine patients (22%) revealed phlegmonous inflammation only, and all recovered without treatment. The three patients considered failures had surgery because of intestinal obstruction or suspected but unverified perforation. Three patients (8.5%) had recurrent appendicitis within 5 months after the initial attack. Diagnostic errors delayed proper therapy for 1 month in a patient with a cecal carcinoma and for 5 months in a patient with Crohn's disease. Late sequelae were observed in four patients, three of whom had surgery. Nonoperative treatment and if possible ultrasonically guided percutaneous drainage of verified abscesses are safe procedures with few complications and late sequelae. However, diligent in-hospital observation and close follow-up are mandatory.\r"

Finally, ejaculatory dysfunction often requires sympathomimetic agents. Alternatively, in the normogonadotropic oligospermic patient, the major form of empiric therapy relies on the enhancement of physiologic hormone levels that influence spermatogenesis. Such \"stimulation\" therapy may be achieved by GnRH analogues, antiestrogens, exogenous gonadotropins, or androgens.\r"

  ".W": "Many treatment modalities are available to patients with disseminated adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Although no single therapeutic approach can be advocated for all patients at the present time, delay of endocrine manipulation until the onset of symptoms is the recommended approach because it maintains the most normal lifestyle in these patients. With the onset of symptoms such as bone pain or urinary retention, or perhaps as disease progression becomes apparent, orchiectomy is recommended to patients with increased cardiovascular risks as well as to those patients who are judged irresponsible in taking oral estrogens. A dose of 1 mg of diethylstilbestrol three times daily achieves a castrate level of serum testosterone and may not increase cardiovascular mortality. Because of the relative safety and lack of side effects, GnRH analogues represent an alternative treatment in selected patients, particularly in those who refuse orchiectomy or have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Hormonal manipulation with androgen deprivation remains the cornerstone of treatment and provides clinical remission in the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer. The prognosis is poor once tumor has recurred. Several secondary forms of endocrine therapy are available, but it would help to be able to select those patients with hormonally sensitive tumors that would respond favorably to these modalities. Transurethral surgery and radiotherapy are effective in palliating patients with bladder outlet obstruction and bony metastases unresponsive to hormonal therapy. Nonhormonal cytotoxic agents are available, but well-controlled studies are required to determine the value of specific agents, whether used alone or in combination.\r"

  ".W": "Recently developed combination chemotherapy programs have now produced durable complete remissions in a significant percentage of patients with advanced urothelial tract malignancies. For advanced disease, efforts must still be directed at developing new agents but must also focus on understanding drug resistance. Some tumors appear to be resistant de novo; others respond for a period of time before a resistant population emerges. Clearly multiple factors come into play. In some cases, pharmacologic factors such as bioavailability metabolism, or toxicities predominate. In other cases, specific genes expressing surface proteins such as the p-glycoprotein identified in resistant ovarian tumors have been implicated. In the 1980s, it is no longer adequate to define tumors simply by pathologic inspection. As demonstrated by Russell and co-workers xenografts of phenotypically similar transitional cell tumors in nude mice demonstrated marked heterogeneity with respect to flow cytometric DNA analysis and immunocytochemistry. With the recent adoption of flow cytometric techniques, both from bladder washings and paraffin sections, insight into the biologic behavior of individual tumors may soon be possible. Blood group antigen expression and monoclonal antibodies to tumor-associated antigens may also help in this regard. For primary tumors, attention is now being focused on protocols aimed at bladder preservation. In some cases, radiation therapy alone can produce long-term survival, despite muscle infiltrating disease. Complete remissions have also been described with chemotherapy alone. The interaction of chemotherapy and radiation therapy has only recently begun to be investigated. In these trials, complete local control must still be the primary goal. Standard criteria for staging and response evaluation, including pathologic documentation of remission status, are crucial. To demonstrate a beneficial effect of therapy, long-term randomized trials will be required. The goal of individualized therapies may soon be possible, which will ideally translate into increased clinical benefit for patients with urothelial tract tumors.\r"

For \"good-risk\" patients, new treatments are being investigated that maintain efficacy and ameliorate toxicity. For \"poor-risk\" patients, innovative therapy is needed to increase the proportion of complete responders. Further progress will be made only through careful randomized trials and the discovery of new drugs.\r"

The changes noted in the results of laboratory tests were considered to be unrelated to the antibiotics administered. Thus, both piperacillin and cefamandole were safe and effective in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections.\r"

Specific diagnoses included tethered cord (nine), syringohydromyelia (seven), congenital tumor unassociated with a tethered cord (four), diastematomyelia (three), and occult sacral meningocele (one). Intraoperative sonography determined the exact relationship of congenital tumors to the cord before opening the dura, which allowed a more precise approach to the mass. Intraoperative sonography identified the lower end of the syrinx cavities, which allowed optimal catheter placement. Fibroglial scar tissue, which may compartmentalize these syrinx cavities, was clearly shown, and the efficacy of shunt catheter placement was immediately determined. In diastematomyelia, intraoperative sonography identified the relationship of the hemicords to bony, cartilaginous, and/or fibrous septa and demonstrated the effect on the tethered hemicords of removing these septa and constructing a single dural sac from the two dural sacs that had enclosed the hemicords. Since significant surgical decisions are based on these sonographic observations, the authors urge widespread use of intraoperative sonography in patients with spinal dysraphism and syringohydromyelia.\r"

The lesions were identified antemortem by either myelography, CT, MR, and/or intraoperative spinal sonography (IOSS). Final diagnosis was based on biopsy material from either the spinal cord lesion, another metastatic site, and/or the primary tumor. Ten patients had primary tumors located outside the central nervous system, while only two patients had primary brain tumors. Metrizamide myelography and CT demonstrated a definite intramedullary mass in nine of 11 patients. In five patients the mass was relatively small, well-defined, single, and resembled a primary spinal cord neoplasm. In the other four patients, longer and sometimes several segments of the cord were involved. These appeared irregular and nodular and were often associated with intradural lesions at separate sites. MR detected not only enlargement and abnormal signal in the cord but also clinically unsuspected brain lesions. IOSS localized lesions for biopsy and monitored tumor resection. These various imaging procedures showed that cord metastases were often more extensive than anticipated clinically. Spread of tumor into the spinal and intracranial subarachnoid space was common. Imaging of the entire spinal canal and brain, preferably with MR, is therefore recommended to aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.\r"

Next in order were those with renal transplants (43%, 64%, and 29%, respectively) and those with renal insufficiency (33%, 53%, and 20%, respectively). Patients with renal disease had significantly more calcifications (p less than .001) than the patients with normal kidney function: arteries, 45% vs 8%; parenchyma, 61% vs 27%; and ducts, 29% vs 9%. Frequencies of calcifications correlated with serum levels of parathyroid hormone. None of the calcifications induced by renal disease simulated those seen in carcinoma of the breast.\r"

Compared with control subjects without gallstones, the majority of patients with gallstones exhibited a higher resting gallbladder volume, less fractional emptying after a fatty meal, and a higher postmeal residual volume. These abnormalities all appeared to stem from an abnormally high resting gallbladder volume. Whether the increased gallbladder volume and decreased postprandial fractional emptying in the gallstone patients represents a primary or secondary abnormality remains to be determined. The results suggest that in some patients decreased gallbladder contractility may contribute to gallstone development or proliferation.\r"

Computer-acquired background-corrected individual renal function was calculated by using both the 1-3-min uptake counts and the 2-4-hr delayed static counts. The degree of correlation between the two was high (r = .96). An equally high correlation was noted in 16 children who were 12 years old or younger, in 15 patients with renal size disparity greater than 60/40%, and in six patients with abnormal creatinine clearances. Ten patients had a 30-min dynamic 99mTc-DTPA study followed immediately by the injection of Tc-GH and acquisition of delayed static images 2-4 hr later. A high degree of correlation (r = .99) was seen between the 1-3-min differential function obtained by using Tc-DTPA and the 2-4-hr delayed differential function obtained by using Tc-GH. This study shows that Tc-GH is a clinically useful and valid tool for calculation of differential renal function and that Tc-GH combines many of the best aspects of Tc-DTPA and Tc-DMSA.\r"

The most common appearance was that of a heterogeneous mass (83%), almost half of which were predominantly anechoic with hypoechoic material. The other cases (17%) were completely homogeneous, either hypo- or hyperechoic. No masses were completely anechoic. Additional sonographic features included a thick rim, septations, and associated cul-de-sac fluid. A rounded hyperechoic mass, representing blood clot, was contained within 13 masses. In addition, some women appeared to have an increased tendency to form ovarian cysts, suggested by the fact that 26% of them had a past, concurrent, or future episode of simple or hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. Because hemorrhagic ovarian cysts have variable sonographic findings, they should be included in the differential diagnosis of any adnexal mass that has good sound through-transmission.\r"

Subfascial hematomas were found in 12 (38%) of 32 patients referred for sonographic evaluation of a fever or a fall in hemoglobin that occurred after a cesarean delivery. In all cases, sonography revealed cystic or complex masses of various sizes anterior to the bladder. The use of high-frequency, short-focus transducers often was necessary to recognize these superficial abnormalities. Seven of the 12 patients had concomitant bladder-flap hematomas between the lower uterine segment and posterior bladder margin. Of the five remaining patients with isolated subfascial hematomas, the sonograms on four were misinterpreted as showing bladder-flap hematomas. The other was diagnosed correctly. Distinction of subfascial hematomas from bladder-flap hematomas and superficial-wound hematomas must be made if surgical evacuation is contemplated.\r"

Serum levels of amino-terminal parathormone were within normal limits in 26% of these patients. In 14 patients who underwent total parathyroidectomy, the accuracy of sonography for the detection of enlarged parathyroid glands was 77% (40/52 lesions).

Clinical corroboration was obtained in all cases. The size of the lesions ranged from 3 to 22 cm. The five smaller lesions (3-6 cm) showed a homogeneous echo pattern, similar to renal cortical echogenicity. The 21 larger lesions varied in echo texture, having a heterogeneous appearance with focal or scattered echopenic or echogenic zones representing areas of tumor necrosis, hemorrhage, and/or, rarely (19%), calcification. Even the largest lesions were fairly well delineated, often with a lobulated border. Few (7/26 or 27%) showed a surrounding echogenic thin capsulelike rim. All five small lesions showed clinical evidence of endocrine activity. Larger lesions were hormonally active less often (9/21 or 43%). Twelve patients (46%) showed no sign of endocrine activity and presented with symptoms such as fever, weight loss, abdominal discomfort, abdominal mass, hematuria, and hypertension. In the pediatric and adolescent age group (0-16 years), all tumors were hormonally active, while only seven (37%) of tumors in the adult population (17-69 years) were hormonally active. Unfortunately no echo pattern was characteristic enough to allow differentiation of adrenal adenoma from carcinoma. Smaller lesions are more likely to be benign, and larger lesions with areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and calcification are more likely to be malignant.\r"

Four of the patients with neuroblastoma had a distinctive sonographic \"lobule\" of increased echogenicity in a part of the larger tumor mass. This sonographic appearance was secondary to the growth pattern of the tumor and was not cell specific. Correlative CT scans in two of the four patients did not differentiate this lobule. Histologically, the lobule was an aggregate of uniform neuroblastoma cells (marginated by reticulin and collagen) without hemorrhage, necrosis, or calcification. This tissue pattern was not seen in any of the other 43 neoplasms, including 12 Wilms' tumors.

  ".W": "During a 6-year period (1979-1985), 142 neonates with significant hydronephrosis were seen. Seventy-eight percent of the cases were discovered on fetal screening during obstetric sonography. Maternal/fetal intervention was virtually never indicated and most babies were asymptomatic. The most common conditions found were obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction (41%), obstruction of the distal ureter (usually primary megaureter) (23%), upper-pole hydronephrosis associated with duplex anomalies (13%), and posterior urethral valves (10%). Seventeen neonates with multicystic dysplastic kidney were seen (three per year or one for every eight with hydronephrosis). In comparison, during the 30-year period, 1947-1977, 146 neonates with significant hydronephrosis were seen. Most cases were discovered because the patients had signs and/or symptoms--either an abdominal mass (an enlarged kidney or bladder) or urosepsis. The three most common conditions were obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction (22%), posterior urethral valves (19%), and ectopic ureterocele (14%). During this period, 53 neonates with multicystic dysplastic kidney were discovered (two per year or one for every three with hydronephrosis). The dramatic increase in the number of neonates found to have hydronephrosis is primarily due to the widespread use of obstetric sonography and concomitant fetal screening. The pattern of causes before 1979 represented the incidence of symptomatic lesions. The current pattern more accurately reflects the true incidence of congenital anomalies of the urinary tract.\r"

Twenty-six percent of neonates developed sonographically detectable thrombosis. Twenty-nine percent of the neonates with thrombosis were asymptomatic, and an additional 24% had hematuria (diagnosed by dipstick) as their only clinical finding. Significant risk factors associated with aortic thrombosis were calcium in the umbilical-artery-catheter infusate, placement of the catheter for any length of time above the renal arteries, and low birth weight. Physical examination did not reliably predict aortic thrombosis, and asymptomatic thrombosis was more frequent than previously recognized.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if there are angiographic findings that correlate with this posttransplantation complication. In a retrospective study, the angiograms of 35 patients with histologically proven allograft rejection were reviewed. The examinations were done because of suspected posttransplantation vascular complications. Abnormal hepatic arteriograms were observed in 30 (86%). Eleven (37%) of the 30 had hepatic artery thrombosis (all had acute rejection). Nineteen (63%) of the 30 had varying degrees of intrahepatic arterial narrowing (14 had acute and five had chronic rejection). Additional findings in patients with acute rejection included stretching of the intrahepatic arterial tree (five cases) and slow flow, poor peripheral arterial filling, and a decrease in the number of intrahepatic arteries (10 cases total). Intrahepatic branch vessel stenoses and occlusions were seen in four patients with chronic rejection. We conclude that there is good correlations between the angiographic findings and histologic evidence of rejection. Although angiography is not advocated as a test for transplant rejection, detection of certain findings raises the possibility of rejection.\r"

CT was most useful in the evaluation of the gross structural integrity of the allograft and in the detection of extrahepatic fluid collections. Low-density foci within the allograft parenchyma were seen in 10 patients (43%) and were associated with infarction and necrosis, infection, malignancy, and rejection. Localized extrahepatic fluid collections (hematomas, bilomas, and seromas) were present in 16 patients (70%); four of the focal fluid collections detected by CT were infected. Since the nature of these fluid collections could not always be determined by CT characteristics, fine-needle aspiration was sometimes required for a specific diagnosis. Prominence of the portal structures was associated with previous or ongoing episodes of rejection in eight of nine patients, likely reflecting increased resistance to portal flow. CT occasionally showed low, dense, and calcified thrombi in the donor aorta and inferior vena cava. CT also showed biliary obstruction in four patients (17%) without identifying its cause. CT is a noninvasive means of imaging the hepatic allograft recipient; providing data on the hepatic parenchyma, vasculature, and biliary system; and identifying the presence of intraabdominal fluid.\r"

All patients had hypoalbuminemia, with serum albumin levels of 2.2-3.3 g/dl (normal range, 3.5-5.0 g/dl). In all patients, the thickness of the gallbladder wall was within the normal range of less than 3 mm.

Narrowing within the right pulmonary artery was seen more clearly by CT and sonography than by cineangiography in one-third of patients. By contrast, narrowing of the origin of the left pulmonary artery shown by cineangiography was not detected by either CT or sonography in four of four patients. CT has a complementary role and should be performed when the pulmonary arteries are not well seen by cineangiography or sonography, confirmation of the patency and adequacy of the pulmonary arteries is necessary before complete repair, or documentation of interval growth of the pulmonary arteries is desired after palliative surgery.\r"

Sonography was correct in determining the site of origin in 39 of 40 surgically proven cases. Among the various sonographic patterns observed, cystic uterine masses and cystic adnexal masses were the most specific, representing hydrometrocolpos or intrauterine pregnancy and benign ovarian cysts, respectively. A nonspecific sonographic pattern was encountered with complex or solid adnexal masses, which were proven to be ovarian teratomas, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, and pelvic abscesses. Occasionally, a specific diagnosis of ovarian teratoma could be made when echogenic foci produced shadowing in a complex adnexal mass. Our results indicate that sonography in girls is reliable in determining the site of origin of a mass and can suggest a specific diagnosis of hydrometrocolpos, benign ovarian cyst, or intrauterine pregnancy.\r"

The differential diagnosis of true precocious puberty includes cerebral and idiopathic categories. This differentiation, which cannot be made endocrinologically due to similarities in pituitary gonadotropin and sex steroid levels, may be facilitated by high-resolution CT. A CT study of 90 children (73 girls and 17 boys) with true precocious puberty was performed at the NIH to detect cerebral causes of their precocious puberty. Thirty-four cerebral abnormalities were demonstrated in 32 children, 16 boys and 16 girls. These included hypothalamic hamartomas (17), hypothalamic astrocytoma (one), optic chiasm lesions (six), ventricular abnormalities (eight), arachnoid cyst (one), and teratoma (one). The CT appearance of these cerebral abnormalities is discussed and related to the endocrinologic findings and natural history of true precocious puberty. A practical neuroradiologic approach to the evaluation of children with precocious puberty is presented.\r"

Plasma PGI2 levels were measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha by radioimmunoassay. Platelet function ex vivo was measured as collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation, release of 12-HETE and thromboxane A2 (measured as TxB2), and was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay, respectively. The plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were unaffected by nafazatrom treatment (p greater than 0.25). Nafazatrom treatment had no effect on TxB2 production, but significantly altered the production of the platelet 12-HETE (p less than 0.05). There was a significant association between the changes in 12-HETE production and clinical improvement. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of nafazatrom is in part related to the inhibition of platelet function via the lipoxygenase pathway, independent of PGI2 stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the nonselective beta blocker, propranolol, on coarctectomy-induced hypertension were evaluated relative to changes in cardiac function, sympathetic tone, and plasma renin activity (PRA). A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, age-stratified design was employed. Propranolol (n = 11, mean age 9.4 years) or placebo (n = 12, mean age 10.2 years) was started 2 days before surgery and continued until 6 days after surgery. In patients on placebo, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac index increased rapidly and peaked within 1 day after surgery. Over the ensuing days these increases gradually abated. Plasma epinephrine and PRA increased markedly within 12 hours after surgery, but returned quickly toward preoperative levels. In contrast, plasma norepinephrine increased more gradually and remained elevated longer. In patients on propranolol, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac index and PRA showed only negligible increases. However, diastolic blood pressure, increased even faster with propranolol than with placebo but to the same extent. Plasma catecholamines showed similar increases on the two treatments. Only in the placebo group was the code broken in the intensive care unit because of hypertension uncontrolled by sodium nitroprusside; this occurred in 6 of 12 patients. We conclude that nonselective beta blockade ameliorates the hyperdynamic circulation and increase in systolic blood pressure following coarctectomy. The initial increase in diastolic blood pressure following surgery in the propranolol group may have been caused by vascular beta-2-receptor blockade resulting in unopposed alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "The beta blockers exhibit clinically significant differences in beta-receptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. These agents also show important differences in their pharmacokinetic profiles, including gastrointestinal absorption, first-pass hepatic metabolism, lipid solubility, protein binding, hepatic biotransformation, pharmacologic activity of metabolites, and renal clearance of unchanged drug and metabolites. These many differences determine the appropriateness of administering a given beta blocker in a given clinical situation. The selection of beta blockers must also take into account concurrent therapy with other agents. Concurrent administration of beta blockers with drugs that alter gastric, hepatic, or renal function may affect blood levels, duration of action, or efficacy of beta-blocker action. The beta blockers vary in the extent to which their action is altered when they are given with other agents, and therapeutic substitution may produce unwanted side effects and toxicity. Elderly patients should be carefully monitored following interchange among beta blockers, since the probability of drug interaction, impact of adverse effects, unpredictability of response, and physiologic variability of renal and liver function is greater than for younger individuals. Therapeutic substitution among beta blockers in patients already stabilized on a given agent will require careful monitoring. Retitration with the new beta blocker will be required in many cases to assure therapeutic equivalence. Beta blockers are currently used for over 20 medical conditions. There is wide variation in the strength of the clinical evidence supporting the use and efficacy of specific beta blockers for specific conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A 2-week placebo run-in phase was followed by 4 weeks of treatment. Eighty-six patients entered the study and 17 withdrew during the course of the study. Both doses of ramipril appeared to be more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure, but significant differences between 2.5 mg of ramipril and placebo were not found in any statistical analyses. In the endpoint analyses (taking the last measurement from each patient), the patients receiving 5 mg of ramipril had significantly larger decreases in blood pressure than the patients receiving placebo (t tests: standing systolic, p less than 0.001; supine diastolic, p less than 0.05; standing diastolic, p less than 0.05) and also than the patients receiving 2.5 mg of ramipril (standing systolic, p less than 0.05). It appears from the results of this study that the minimum effective dosage of ramipril is 5 mg once daily. No clinically relevant side effects or clinically relevant changes in laboratory values were observed.\r"

  ".W": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ramipril and captopril were administered in doses of 10 mg once daily and 50 mg twice daily, respectively, to patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 4-week single-blind placebo washout period, patients were treated for 12 weeks with 1 of the drugs under double-blind conditions. Patients who did not respond after 6 weeks of treatment were given 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide concomitantly. The ramipril group showed greater decreases in blood pressure compared with baseline values: 20.1/14.9 mm Hg (ramipril) compared with 16.5/13.5 mm Hg (captopril). A further 6 weeks of treatment lowered the blood pressure even more: 22.5/20.0 mm Hg (ramipril) compared with 20.5/18.6 mm Hg (captopril). Concomitant hydrochlorothiazide given to nonresponders reduced the blood pressure levels in 24 of 40 patients in the ramipril group and in 20 of 36 patients in the captopril group. At the end of the study the overall response to treatment with ramipril alone and ramipril plus hydrochlorothiazide was 77.1%. The overall response rate in the captopril group was 82.7%. No clinically relevant adverse reaction occurred in any patient. Ramipril given once daily was as effective as captopril given twice daily in lowering blood pressure. Both drugs proved to be safe during treatment for 12 weeks.\r"

The 5 treatments were administered daily by gavage for 8 days in doses inducing identical decreases in arterial blood pressure. This effect was entirely due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance inasmuch as cardiac index was not affected by the 5 ACE inhibitors. In addition, despite their different chemical structures, all exhibited the same regional vasodilator pattern, which thus appears to be related only to ACE inhibition. The vascular beds resistances were decreased in the following order: renal greater than splenic = liver greater than skin greater than total peripheral greater than muscle = brain. Simultaneously, and despite the decrease in perfusion pressure, most regional blood flows and especially renal blood flow were increased. Finally, renal vasodilator effects of ACE inhibitors were observed even after doses that lacked any effect on total peripheral resistance.\r"

Systolic blood pressure had decreased by an average of 22.5 mm Hg independent of the dose administered. Diastolic blood pressure was decreased to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg in 64%, 63% and 77% of the patients in the 3 groups, respectively. The differences in these percentages among the groups were not statistically significant. The tolerability of the drug was good; discontinuation of treatment was necessary for 1 patient in the 1.25 mg group and medication was lowered for 2 patients because of adverse reactions. There were no clinically significant changes of any laboratory variables, except for an increase in uric acid serum levels.\r"

  ".W": "Acute hemodynamic and hormonal responses to ramipril in comparison with captopril were studied in 10 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure in an open, randomized study. Both drugs were given to 5 patients each in 2 increasing doses on 2 successive days. After 5 mg of ramipril angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was significantly decreased during 24 hours with a maximum decrease 4 hours after administration. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 84 +/- 5 to 62 +/- 5 mm Hg at 4 hours and 71 +/- 4 mm Hg at 12 hours, respectively, after this dose. Capillary wedge pressure decreased from 19 +/- 1 mm Hg to 13 +/- 1 mm Hg at 4 hours with a maximum increase in cardiac output from 3.8 +/- 0.3 liters/min to 4.4 +/- 0.3 liters/min at 2 hours. No significant cardiac effects were present 8 hours after administration. After 10 mg of ramipril, cardiac and hormonal effects showed a quicker onset of action and longer duration compared with the 5 mg dose. Mean arterial pressure decreased to 61 +/- 6 mm Hg. Similar effects were seen after captopril, but with a significantly shorter duration. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 82 +/- 4 mm Hg to 64 +/- 5 mm Hg after 12.5 mg and to 58 +/- 6 mm Hg after 25 mg of captopril. In patients with congestive heart failure ramipril has the hemodynamic profile of a long-acting and potent ACE inhibitor. Significant cardiac effects are present during 4 to 8 hours and ACE activity is still significantly inhibited 24 hours after a single dose of ramipril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both groups were similar with respect to baseline hemodynamic measurements and plasma levels of norepinephrine, renin and vasopressin. The group receiving ramipril showed hemodynamic changes comparable to the group receiving captopril on the seventh day of treatment. The stroke volume index increased by 20% versus 21%, respectively, and the total peripheral resistance decreased by 13% versus 20%, respectively. The decrease in blood pressure and the tendency to decrease heart rate were similar in both groups. All patients had reactive hyperreninemia during therapy with the converting enzyme inhibitor. The resting elevated plasma norepinephrine decreased in both groups significantly, whereas vasopressin did not change. The hemodynamic improvement was more pronounced and comparable in both groups during exercise. Thus, ramipril is equally effective compared with captopril in the treatment of patients with severe congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Local tissue renin-angiotensin systems have recently been discovered in various organs, and evidence is accumulating that inhibition of these local renin-angiotensin systems may contribute to the actions of converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors. Measurements of CE activity and angiotensin II concentrations revealed that after oral administration of CE inhibitors, CE was inhibited not only in lung vascular endothelium and blood, but also in the heart, kidney, vascular wall, brain and other organs. The functional significance of tissue CE inhibition is suggested first by the antihypertensive effect of brain CE inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats, second by the concomitant persistence of blood pressure decrease and CE inhibition in vascular wall and kidney after long-term oral CE inhibitor treatment and third by ex vivo experiments demonstrating marked effects of oral CE inhibitor pretreatment on cardiac function in isolated rat hearts. Local inhibition of tissue renin-angiotensin systems may be an important factor involved in the beneficial effects of CE inhibitors in such cardiovascular diseases as arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias.\r"

Acute infusions of both angiotensins produced dose-dependent decreases in blood flow (measured by venous occlusion plethysmography). To produce equivalent effects the dose of angiotensin I was 2 to 4 times that of angiotensin II. After ramipril diacid the response to angiotensin II was unchanged, while the dose of angiotensin I required to produce an equipotent response was increased 20-fold. Ramipril diacid given alone produced a small, nonsignificant increase in forearm flow, although the response was significantly related to basal plasma renin. The study confirms the presence of converting enzyme activity within human resistance vessels, and suggests that inhibition of converting enzyme, at sites other than the pulmonary vascular bed, might contribute to the hypotensive action of converting enzyme inhibitors.\r"

Ramipril lowered supine and standing blood pressure in both groups, but the effect was greater in essential hypertension. The maximal blood pressure response followed the effect on plasma ACE after a lag time of 3 to 4 hours in both groups. These data provide indirect evidence that ramipril lowers blood pressure, at least in part, independently of its effect on the circulating renin-angiotensin system, possibly by acting on tissue ACE.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac arrhythmias may result from abnormalities of impulse propagation or abnormalities of impulse initiation. When arrhythmias are initiated by antiarrhythmic drugs, the most common mechanisms appear to be conduction block or reentry, and abnormal impulse initiation, which may be triggered by afterdepolarizations. The effects of drugs on conduction may result from their actions on the fast sodium channel, the slow calcium channel or their ability to prolong repolarization. The extent to which a drug that depresses fast sodium or slow calcium entry will exert its toxic effects depends in large part on its binding characteristics to its channel receptor site. Such toxicity represents a continuum for the therapeutic effects of these drugs. The factors that control drug access to binding sites, including lipid solubility, molecular size and extent of ionization, are reviewed, as are the contributions to conduction abnormalities of drug-induced changes in repolarization. The mechanisms whereby drugs induce abnormalities of impulse initiation are still a matter of conjecture. Apparently, drugs that increase inward plateau currents or decrease repolarizing potassium ion currents carry increased risk. Moreover, there is evidence for the role of early after depolarizations occurring secondary to prolonged repolarization as a possible cause of arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes. The mechanisms whereby antiarrhythmic drugs may contribute to this type of tachyarrhythmia are reviewed.\r"

Inappropriate dosage selection, mistakenly based on pharmacokinetic data from \"normal\" subjects, may result in adverse reactions when an antiarrhythmic drug is given to patients. Unexpected variations in drug clearance can increase plasma concentration of antiarrhythmic agents and aggravate arrhythmias. Changes in the rate of drug metabolism by the liver, e.g., due to cessation of alcohol or drugs that induce hepatic metabolism, can reduce drug clearance, making a previously well-tolerated dose toxic. Another possible explanation for adverse drug reactions is nonlinear protein binding. Recently, genetic determinants of drug metabolism have been identified as explanations of interindividual variations in drug responsiveness. Finally, the interactions of antiarrhythmic agents may also lead to aggravation of arrhythmias. A better understanding of the pharmacology of antiarrhythmic agents can reduce, if not prevent, the occurrence of potentially lethal proarrhythmic events.\r"

Digitalis glycosides and class I, II, III, or IV antiarrhythmic drugs can cause severe sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block. Digitalis can cause a variety of supraventricular arrhythmias; atrial tachycardia with block and nonparoxysmal atrioventricular junctional tachycardia are the most characteristic. Recognition that class IA and class III antiarrhythmic drugs can aggravate arrhythmias or cause new arrhythmias in patients being treated for potentially malignant or malignant ventricular arrhythmias has intensified the interest in proarrhythmia in recent years. Several characteristic types of proarrhythmic response have been described. Torsades de pointes (multiform) ventricular tachycardia (VT) accompanied by prolongation of the QT interval can be caused by class IA and class III antiarrhythmic drugs as well as other drugs that bind to the membrane sodium channels of ventricular cells, for example, tricyclic antidepressants. Uniform VT in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias and poor left ventricular function is a characteristic proarrhythmic response to class IC antiarrhythmic drugs. Bidirectional VT or accelerated idioventricular rhythm are characteristic of digitalis toxicity. More difficult to establish as proarrhythmic responses are increased frequency of ventricular premature depolarizations and increased ease of inducing VT with programmed ventricular stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if the calcium antagonist nicardipine protects the myocardium against ischemia, myocardial lactate, hypoxanthine and prostanoid function was studied in 12 patients during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Values were obtained before balloon inflation and during 4 minutes after deflation. Intracoronary injection of 0.2 mg of nicardipine distal to the stenosis was done randomly before the first or second inflation; the other inflation served as a control. One minute after deflation, coronary sinus flow levels were similar during the nicardipine and control procedure (161 +/- 61 vs 159 +/- 72 ml/min); lactate (-9 +/- 21% vs -17 +/- 21%, p less than 0.025) and hypoxanthine production (-107 +/- 85% vs -218 +/- 153%, p less than 0.05) were less severe after nicardipine pretreatment than after control. All patients reverted to lactate extraction 4 minutes after inflation plus nicardipine infusion, whereas lactate was still produced 4 minutes after control inflation. No significant changes in thromboxane B2 or prostacyclin levels were observed in the coronary sinus 1 minute after inflation, but higher arterial thromboxane B2 values were observed after control inflation than after inflation with nicardipine infusion (median values 169 vs 78 pg/ml, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, intracoronary infusion of nicardipine reduced signs of ischemia and alterations in prostanoid handling after coronary occlusion. The mechanisms of myocardial protection appeared unrelated to coronary sinus blood flow changes or to a systemic effect of nicardipine.\r"

End-diastolic and end-systolic short-axis area and percent area reduction of right and left ventricles were determined during 5-cm H2O stepwise increments of PEEP ventilation. Simultaneously, cardiac output and right- and left-sided hemodynamic values were determined. Cardiac output, mean arterial pressure and end-diastolic area of both ventricles gradually decreased, and right and left atrial and pulmonary arterial pressures (mainstem and capillary wedge) increased. Left ventricular end-systolic area did not change, whereas right ventricular area decreased. Percent area reduction of both ventricles decreased (p less than 0.01). Thus, decrease in cardiac output during PEEP ventilation is primarily caused by decrease of preload rather than compromised contractility.\r"

After 60 mg, only heart rate (from 86 +/- 10 beats/min at baseline to 79 +/- 14 beats/min at 4 hours) and pulmonary vascular resistance (from 231 +/- 108 to 165 +/- 74 dynes s cm-5 at 4 hours) changed significantly. Administration of 90 mg of diltiazem resulted in no significant change in any of the measured or calculated central hemodynamic variables. Individual data, however, revealed an increase stroke volume index in 3 patients but a decrease in 1 patient and a persistent increase in mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure in another patient. These hemodynamic changes were not associated with symptomatic deterioration in any of the patients. Both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were impaired at baseline on both days and did not show a significant change 1, 2 and 4 hours after diltiazem administration. Similarly, no significant change was noted after either diltiazem dose in plasma catecholamine levels and renin concentration. In conclusion, administration of 60 to 90 mg of diltiazem in patients with severe chronic LV systolic dysfunction results in only mild and mostly insignificant acute effects on central and renal hemodynamics, plasma hormonal levels and patient clinical status.\r"

This study investigated the influence of recipient atrial contraction timing on Doppler ultrasound mitral flow velocity curves, isovolumic relaxation time, peak early mitral flow velocity (M1), mitral valve pressure half-time and peak mitral flow velocity due to atrial systole (M2). Clearly identifiable recipient atrial electrical activity (P waves) was present in 7 of 10 patients studied early postoperatively 2 to 6 months (mean 2.5) (early group) and in 20 of 24 patients seen 1 to 11 years (mean 3) after transplantation (late group). Median age and gender distribution were similar in both groups. For analysis of its influence on isovolumic relaxation time, pressure half-time and M1, recipient atrial contraction was classified by its position in the cardiac cycle as early systole, late systole or diastole. For analysis of M2, it was classified as early diastole, late diastole or systole. Compared with its occurrence in diastole, recipient atrial contraction in late systole was associated with a shorter isovolumic relaxation time, shorter pressure half-time and higher M1. In early systole it was associated with a longer pressure half-time and lower M1 than in diastole; isovolumic relaxation time was unchanged. Recipient atrial contraction in early diastole resulted in a lower M2 than in systole, whereas simultaneous contraction of recipient and donor atria in late diastole resulted in an increase in M2. These results indicate that the timing of recipient atrial contraction and relaxation significantly influences left ventricular filling dynamics.\r"

  ".U": "87209773\r", 
  ".W": "During a 4-year experience with cardiac transplantation, 33 hearts were obtained by autopsy or surgical resection for retransplantation. Arteritis was a feature common to all rejected hearts (14 of 14), but was absent in explanted hearts without rejection (0 of 19) (p = 0.001). Monitoring of acute cardiac rejection by endomyocardial biopsy (863 biopsies) was also reviewed, with special reference to the incidence of arteritis. Among the 16 patients with arteritis on 1 or more biopsies, 44% (7 patients, confidence limits 29 to 60%) suffered fatal rejection or underwent retransplantation because of irreversible rejection. Arteritis was seen in the small vessels obtained by endomyocardial biopsy in 4 of 5 persons who underwent biopsy within 3 days of death or retransplantation due to rejection and on none of the 6 persons who underwent biopsy within 3 days of death or retransplantation for causes other than rejection. Thus, arteritis is an important indicator for severe acute rejection, and although often reversible, may identify patients at higher risk for fatal rejection. Arteritis occurred in transplanted hearts subjected to varying combinations of cyclosporine, azathioprine and steroid therapy and could not be correlated with any drug regimen.\r"

  ".W": "The possession of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) by a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug results in a number of different pharmacologic properties. Most profound are the central hemodynamic effects. A drug with a significant degree of ISA results in less of a decrease in heart rate at rest and cardiac output, and, at least partly because of this, less of a decrease in peripheral blood flow. If prevailing sympathetic tone is low enough (e.g., during sleep) and the degree of ISA is sufficient, an increase in heart rate may be seen from an ISA-possessing drug. If the drug possesses beta 2 ISA, then a peripheral vasodilation action from stimulation of beta 2 vasodilator receptors may also be relevant. If high levels of exercise and full dosages of the drugs are used, a beta-blocking drug with ISA produces less of a decrease in heart rate. In asthmatic subjects, the modest beta-stimulant action on bronchial smooth muscle is not important, as these patients are potentially sensitive to any receptor blockade. Isoprenaline responses are inhibited to a similar degree compared with inhibition of exercise tachycardia, by nonselective drugs with and without ISA, whereas beta 1 selective agents produce much less inhibition of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. A drug with ISA \"down regulates\" beta receptors; thus, when the drug is withdrawn there is no post-beta-blocking drug hypersensitivity in contrast to agents without ISA. There is evidence that ISA results in less of a disturbance in certain metabolic processes, particularly lipid metabolism and the metabolism of liver-metabolized drugs.\r"

It appears that an \"overshoot\" in heart rate from pretreatment values occurs, which increases myocardial oxygen demand. This increase in heart rate may be secondary to increased beta receptor numbers or increased receptor sensitivity. Another possible mechanism for the increased risk of myocardial infarction after beta-blocker withdrawal is increased platelet aggregability. Withdrawal reactions may be less severe with beta blockers that have partial agonist activity. In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, beta-blocker withdrawal reactions have also been observed. Maintenance of beta-blocker therapy on the morning of surgery appears to reduce this risk. Gradual withdrawal regimens in outpatients with angina may be associated with lower risk for a beta-blocker withdrawal reaction. The gradual withdrawal of beta blockers in hypertensive patients requires further study.\r"

  ".W": "Almost all beta-adrenergic blockers, regardless of their pharmacologic characteristics, appear to have blood pressure-lowering activity in hypertensive patients. Comparisons between nonselective beta-blocking agents, such as propranolol and nadolol, with beta 1-selective drugs, such as metoprolol, atenolol and acebutolol, have demonstrated close similarities in their antihypertensive effects in patients. Similarly, beta blockers with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) have comparable antihypertensive effects. However, beta-selective agents may offer some advantages over conventional beta blockers in hypertensive patients with concurrent conditions such as chronic obstructive airways disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Beta 1-selective drugs are also preferred in diabetic patients receiving hypoglycemic agents because they do not interfere with glycogenolysis. Agents lacking ISA, such as propranolol, acutely increase peripheral resistance. beta blockers with ISA usually lower resistance. ISA may also minimize the bradycardia frequently found in elderly patients. Agents with ISA may protect against the decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and the modest increase in triglycerides noted with some beta blockers that do not have ISA. Thus, in a large number of clinical situations in which hypertension is found, the properties of beta 1 selectivity and ISA allow beta blockers to be used with greater safety. Therefore, agents possessing both of these properties may be particularly valuable.\r"

The role of these micronutrients in insulin secretion and carbohydrate metabolism is discussed in an attempt to determine whether the reported alterations in serum or tissue content of minerals or vitamins contribute to the carbohydrate intolerance of diabetic patients. It is concluded that both Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus can result in changes in certain micronutrients. However, adequately controlled studies to establish the role of trace elements in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus are not available.\r"

Concurrent ingestion of fat resulted in a large impairment of glucose tolerance following the standard lunch 4 h later. There was no significant difference in glucose and insulin if the fat eaten was butter or peanut butter. When the fat breakfast was compared with the isocaloric larger carbohydrate meal, the effect of fat on carbohydrate tolerance at lunch was even greater. Part of the reason for this additional difference is an improved glucose tolerance at lunch due to the higher carbohydrate content of the breakfast. Concurrent ingestion of fat and reduction of starch content have a persistent effect on carbohydrate tolerance to subsequent meals.\r"

The current requirements for protein and amino acids in various groups of healthy people were then summarized. Emerging from this discussion was the view that some plant protein foods, such as soy for example, are of much better nutritional value for humans than has been commonly appreciated. The figures for requirements were then compared with intakes characteristic of populations in the developed regions of the world. It is evident that these intakes greatly exceed the minimum physiologic need for most healthy individuals but little is known about the possible health benefit or otherwise of these intake levels of protein. Furthermore, also it was pointed out that consideration of different food proteins in relation to amino acid and nitrogen requirements constitutes an important, but only an initial, basis for evaluating the role of dietary protein and of various food protein sources in human nutrition and health. Different food protein sources influence, in various ways, the utilization of and possibly requirements for other nutrients. This complicates determination of requirements and the setting of rational and safe dietary allowances as well as of dietary guidelines for individuals and population groups. A further assessment of the role and impact of food proteins and their interrelationships with and interactions among other foods and essential nutrients, particularly with respect to the nutritional and metabolic status of free-living individuals and their long-term health, presents a difficult but exciting research challenge to nutrition and other health professionals.\r"

Input for this system consists of limited demographic information on each patient and the results of the complete blood count, with the incorporation of the results of further chemical testing (serum iron/total iron binding capacity/ferritin and serum B12/serum folate/red blood cell folate), if indicated. Performance of this system is demonstrated using data from 84 patients seen in the authors' laboratory selected either because of a request for evaluation by the attending physician or because of significant anemias. Using this limited input, the system was able to accurately classify 74 of 84 (88%) of cases according to previously established criteria. The output from the system is overread by a pathologist. Future directions are also discussed.\r"

Although no evidence of HTLV-III infectivity has appeared after injection of similar preparations into humans, the authors found all samples IEMA reactive. Upon dilution, the authors demonstrated parallel decreases of antibody reactivity among two samples of gamma globulin, the Abbott-positive control, and a markedly reactive patient specimen. Gamma globulin isolated from sera of six animal species was nonreactive in the Abbott assay. All samples were nonreactive with the H-9 cell line antigen. Antibody reactivity to HTLV-III was confirmed in 13 of 15 gamma globulin samples when tested by the Electro-Nucleonics IEMA, and 14 samples contained at least the p24 band on Western blot analysis. Although false positivity occurs in IEMA assays possibly because of elevated protein concentrations and nonspecific binding, the authors, results show that in most circumstances immune serum globulin preparations tested do contain true reactivity to HTLV-III.\r"

  ".W": "Growth performance was evaluated in 69 children, aged 3 to 16 years, who had undergone kidney transplantation between 1974 and 1984. Forty children (21 boys, 19 girls) who received transplants before September 1982 were treated conventionally with azathioprine and high-dose prednisolone; 29 children (13 boys, 16 girls) who received transplants after September 1982 were treated with cyclosporine and low-dose prednisolone. The mean (+/- SD) survival times of grafts in the azathioprine and cyclosporine groups were 6.0 +/- 2.1 years and 1.4 +/- 0.5 years, respectively. Height and bone age were evaluated at the time of transplantation, one year after transplantation, and at reevaluation in December 1985. Growth rates expressed by standard deviation scores (SDS) declined in the azathioprine group for boys (mean, -2.2 at transplantation, -2.5 after one year, and -2.8 in December 1985) and girls (-2.1, -2.4, and -2.7) and improved in the cyclosporine group for boys (-2.5, -2.2, and -2.1) and girls (-2.2, -1.9, and -1.8). The difference between both groups one year after transplantation was significant. This trend continued beyond the first year after transplantation. Graft function was better in the azathioprine group than in the cyclosporine group. Bone age in December 1985 was less retarded in the cyclosporine group, but this could have been related to the shorter observation time. We conclude that somatic growth after kidney transplantation is below expected rates under azathioprine-prednisolone immunosuppression but is significantly better under cyclosporine-prednisolone immunosuppression.\r"

Subsequently, 28 patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which patients whose effusion failed to clear were crossed over to the alternative regimen. In this trial, ten treated children (71%) experienced partial or complete resolution one month after therapy compared with three (21%) in the control group. Patients enrolled in both trials whose effusion cleared were followed up monthly for six months. Seven of 29 patients required referral for ventilation tubes.\r"

On October 11, 1923, the southbound Southern Pacific Express was halted by three men at Tunnel 13 in southern Oregon just north of the California line. The railway mail car carrying +40,000 was then blown apart by an explosive charge, killing the clerk and rendering the money unobtainable. The men shot three other train crew members before escaping into the mountains. The investigation was headed by Chief Agent Dan O'Connell, who soon asked that California criminalist, Edward Heinrich, examine soiled overalls found nearby. Using primarily botanical evidence, Heinrich identified them as those of a woodsman, leading to the identification of three Oregon d'Autremont brothers as suspects. After an intensive manhunt, one was captured 3 years later in the Philippines and was tried and found guilty. The twins, captured in Ohio, then pleaded guilty. This crime, typical of those in which unforeseen events lead the perpetrators to panic and to murder, helped to establish criminology and particularly botanical studies as valid scientific disciplines. Its investigation and solution also remain models of scientific crime detection.\r"

Infusion of 20 mg famotidine did not reduce hepatic blood flow and portal blood flow in normal subjects, nor did it reduce cardiac output, the gradient between wedged hepatic vein pressure and free hepatic vein pressure, hepatic blood flow, and portal blood flow in patients with chronic liver disease. An oral dose of 20 mg famotidine twice daily for 2 months healed peptic ulcer in 19 of 20 patients (95%) with chronic liver disease and peptic ulcer, without any change in portal blood flow and hepatic function. Thus famotidine does not appear to alter hepatic hemodynamics and hepatic function in normal subjects and patients with chronic liver disease.\r"

Portal venous flow (control value 10.5 +/- 2.3 ml/min/kg body weight) minus the sum of superior mesenteric venous flow and splenic venous flow was 0.8 +/- 2.1 ml/min/kg body weight in the control, (0.1 +/- 1.9) in chronic active hepatitis, and (-2.2 +/- 4.3) in liver cirrhosis; the difference was significant between the control and cirrhosis groups. These results indicate that in patients with liver cirrhosis a hyperdynamic state occurs in the splanchnic circulation of the intestine and spleen and that some portion of splanchnic blood flow bypasses the liver into the systemic circulation.\r"

At the concentration of antibody used, histologically normal liver tissues were negative for p21 antigen, whereas hepatocytes of cirrhotic nodules from 80 of 92 HCC patients (87.4%), and 10 of 32 patients without HCC (59.4%) were positive. This difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). The incidence of p21 expression by hepatocytes was significantly higher in macronodular cirrhotic patients than in those with micronodular cirrhosis (p less than 0.05) and tended to be higher in those positive for hepatic hepatitis B virus markers than in those that were negative (p less than 0.1). All 16 patients with liver cell dysplasia, and 17 of 18 with adenomatous hyperplasias showed increased expression of p21 antigen. In HCC it was detected on tumor cells of 63 of 101 patients (62.4%). Characteristically, its expression in well-differentiated HCC was mild and uniformly diffuse, and in moderately differentiated tumors was markedly heterogeneous in both intensity and distribution, whereas no expression was observed in cells of poorly differentiated HCC. These observations suggest that elevated ras p21 antigen expression is important in the development of both cirrhotic nodules and HCC, but that after tumor development, its sustained elevation is no longer necessary for cell proliferation and progression through the grades of anaplasia.\r"

All patients were randomized to either placebo or ranitidine (150 mg bid) treatment groups. The treatment interval was 6 wk. Thirty-seven percent of 283 patients enrolled in the trial had normal baseline endoscopy. Compared to the placebo group, 147 evaluable ranitidine patients with abnormal endoscopy displayed a marked and rapid symptom reduction which was sustained throughout the last 4 wk of therapy. Despite randomization of endoscopically normal patients, those treated with ranitidine had significantly more heartburn at baseline. However, the 89 evaluable ranitidine-treated patients with normal endoscopy also experienced a marked and rapid reduction in heartburn at the end of 1 wk. The symptomatic improvement in the endoscopically abnormal ranitidine patients was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than that observed in the endoscopically normal ranitidine group. Since both groups fared better on ranitidine than placebo, the results of this study indicate that ranitidine is an effective treatment for patients with heartburn symptoms and documented esophageal acid sensitivity whether or not endoscopic parameters for esophagitis are present.\r"

The increased excretion of glucose and other nutrients in as well uric acid and protein is related in part to altered tubular function.

Cognizance of all these alterations is essential if kidney problems in pregnancy are to be suspected, detected, and managed correctly.\r"

  ".W": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increase during gestation in humans, rats, rabbits, dogs, and sheep. Serial studies performed in chronically instrumented conscious pregnant rats show that the relative time course of changes in renal hemodynamics resembles that of human pregnancy. Because gestational alterations of renal hemodynamics in humans are similar to those in other mammalian species, animal models are being used to investigate possible mechanisms for these changes. In gravid rats and rabbits, vasodilatory prostaglandins most likely do not mediate the increase of GFR and ERPF. Chronic administration of prolactin has been tested in nonpregnant rats, and although some studies suggest that this hormone can augment renal hemodynamics, others do not. The decline in GFR and ERPF, which in rats occurs close to term despite ongoing increments of plasma volume, does not appear to be mediated by angiotensin II. Cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) is increased in the plasma of pregnant rats, and urinary excretion rates are also enhanced. Research is presently continuing to determine if intracellular and/or extracellular cGMP contribute to the vasodepressor phenomena observed during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in the rat have permitted a complete characterization of the glomerular hemodynamic changes that occur during a normal pregnancy. The rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the result of an evenly distributed increase in plasma flow to all nephrons due to vasodilation of both pre- and postglomerular resistance vessels. Pregnancy is not associated with any change in blood pressure in the glomerular capillaries; neither is there any detectable alteration in the glomerular water permeability or filtration surface area. Despite the chronically maintained renal vasodilation of pregnancy, gravid rats exhibit substantial renal reserve when challenged with an amino acid load, indicating that a residual renal vasodilatory capacity exists in the kidney of the normal pregnant animal. Despite the concomitant plasma volume expansion of pregnancy, the tubuloglomerular feedback system (a volume regulatory system that modulates GFR) remains fully active in the pregnant rat, suggesting that the plasma volume in pregnancy is not sensed as expanded by this system. The factor(s) that initiates the gestational rise in GFR is currently unknown, although since similar renal hemodynamic changes occur in the pseudopregnant rat, the stimulus is maternal rather than fetoplacental in origin.\r"

In humans, the decrease in the osmotic threshold for thirst may precede decrements in the arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretory threshold by several weeks, whereas the metabolic clearance rate of AVP appears markedly increased in the third trimester. The cause of these osmoregulatory changes are unclear, since through 1986 we have been unable to implicate placental extracts, estrogens, progesterone, prolactin, angiotensin II, and certain endorphins in the decreased Posm observed during rat pregnancy. Changes also occur in volume-AVP secretory relationships in pregnancy. For instance, the volume-sensing AVP release mechanisms are altered during gestation in Sprague-Dawley rats in such a way that the increased intravascular volume is recognized as normal.\r"

Of interest is a group of women with transient DI of gestation. In some of these patients, central DI is brought to the fore by increases in water turnover during pregnancy as well as increments in the metabolic clearance of arginine vasopressin (AVP), especially near term. Others have a \"vasopressin-resistant\" form of the disease, which in one case followed by us appeared to be due to marked increments in circulating cystine-aminopeptidase (vasopressinase). This patient's DI was resistant to pitressin, but she concentrated her urine when given dDAVP. Her vasopressinase levels 2 weeks postpartum were still several-fold those of normal term gravidas. Her DI remitted, and she concentrated her urine appropriately 2 months postpartum. This article reviews the different forms of DI peculiar to pregnancy.\r"

Alternatively, a primary enlargement of the vascular compartment (eg, prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation and placental arteriovenous shunting) with secondary renal sodium and water retention (underfill hypothesis) is supported by the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system, resetting of vasopressin release and thirst to a lower plasma osmolality, and a further stimulation of the RAA system and vasopressin when pregnant rats' water intake is maintained at a level of a virgin rat fluid intake, diminished BP and increased cardiac output in the first trimester, and worsening of hyponatremia with sodium restriction in the pregnant but not the virgin rat. With the underfill hypothesis, normal sodium and water excretion with mineralocorticoid escape could be mediated by hormonally induced increases in GFR and RBF associated with pregnancy. The nature of such a hormone effect of pregnancy to enhance renal hemodynamics remains to be defined.\r"

Recent reviews examined some of the more closely investigated facets of sodium and volume control in normal and hypertensive pregnancy.

Gravid rodents undergo extracellular and plasma volume increases of 50% to 70%, and these changes accompany a marked cumulative sodium retention shared by both dam and fetuses. Pregnancy alters several factors, with opposing effects on renal salt handling; however, mechanisms by which gestational sodium accumulation and volume expansion are achieved remain obscure. Furthermore, despite substantial increases in absolute blood volume, considerable uncertainty exists as to how this volume is sensed, particularly during the final gestational week when a rapid increase in volume is associated with decreases in peripheral resistance and BP. Attempts to assess \"effective\" intravascular volume by measuring responses to intravenous (IV) or oral sodium loading or to chronic mineralocorticoid administration indicate that pregnant and nonpregnant rats respond similarly, suggesting that such animals sense their volume as normal. In contrast, when salt-restricted, gravid rats fail to expand their plasma volume normally; this relative hypovolemia activates mechanisms leading to free water retention and pathologic hyponatremia, responses not observed in virgin animals.\r"

  ".W": "Human pregnancy is characterized by a blunted pressor responsiveness to vasopressor substances. This was first reported by Dieckmann and Michel in 1937 in experiments in which they measured vascular reactivity to the pressor effects of a crude preparation of vasopressin. Recently, this has been reported to occur in response to epinephrine, norepinephrine (NE), and angiotensin II (AII). Gant and associates reported that the increasing vascular sensitivity to infused AII not only was characteristic of women who developed pregnancy-induced hypertension, but in fact preceded the development of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Although a variety of factors may mediate this blunted pressor responsiveness, the most likely candidate appears to be the localized production within endothelium and/or vascular smooth muscle of prostaglandins. Indeed, administration of indomethacin or aspirin results in an increased sensitivity to infused AII in normotensive previously AII-refractory women. Administration of the steroid hormone 5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone reverses this apparent prostaglandin-mediated response. In addition, administration of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline, results in a restoration of vascular refractoriness to infused AII in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension or in women destined to develop pregnancy-induced hypertension. Although a variety of known and possibly unknown compounds might also effect the control of vascular reactivity during human pregnancy, the prostinoids appear to play a pivotal role in mediation of control of vascular reactivity during human pregnancy.\r"

Although a blunted pressor response to angiotensin II (AII) has been most thoroughly documented, resistance to the pressor effects of norepinephrine (NE), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) has also been found. In this review, possible mechanisms for decreased pressor responsiveness are discussed. Although antagonism of vasoconstriction by vasodilatory prostaglandins is the most likely cause for decreased pressor responsiveness in pregnancy, other possibilities have been proposed. Reduced pressor responsiveness to AII occurs in many conditions other than pregnancy, and the mechanisms involved include down-regulation of AII receptors, increased production of vasodilatory prostaglandins (as in pregnancy), and post-receptor defects in AII action. Several recent studies have also suggested a role of the sex hormones, particularly 17-beta-estradiol and prolactin, in stimulating prostaglandin production and causing the decreased pressor response to AII in pregnancy.\r"

Overall incidence of live births was 175 in 217 (81%). Fetal loss, corrected for induced abortions, was 10 in 66 (15%) in IgAGN, 18 in 129 (14%) in RN, and 2 in 10 in FGS. Renal failure and hypertension preexisting prior to conception or developing early in pregnancy were the most important factors associated with unsuccessful fetal outcome whereas urinary tract infection had limited effects in RN patients. Influence of pregnancy on the course of maternal renal disease was evaluated in the same groups of patients. An abnormally rapid deterioration of renal function was observed in three of the women with IgAGN and in one of the RN patients (with an additional case among 46 further female RN patients) but in none in the FGS group. All five women experiencing functional deterioration had a serum creatinine (SCr) level of greater than or equal to 200 mumol/L (2.3 mg/dL) and hypertension at conception. Hypertension in pregnancy was highly predictive of recurrence of hypertension in subsequent pregnancy and of the remote development of permanent hypertension in IgAGN patients. We conclude that when renal function is preserved, pregnancy is usually successful and no deleterious effects on maternal renal disease are to be expected in patients with IgAN, RN, and probably FGS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Moreover, some patients with long-standing diabetes have vascular complications, including renal insufficiency and hypertension, that represent separate risk factors for optimal fetal development. During the past two to three decades, maternal mortality has been eliminated and perinatal deaths have been reduced in all classes of diabetic patients, including those with diabetic nephropathy, to a level approaching that of normal pregnant women. Fetal and neonatal morbidity have also been reduced, although rates of congenital abnormalities and respiratory disease syndrome remain high. In patients with significant vascular complications, such as nephropathy and retinopathy, pregnancy evidently does not alter the natural course of these complications. With meticulous metabolic control and fetal surveillance, however, women with diabetic nephropathy without severe renal insufficiency or severe hypertension can anticipate a pregnancy outcome similar to that of other insulin-dependent diabetic patients.\r"

In chronic studies to investigate the long-term effects on kidney function of pregnancy, normal rats undergoing five closely spaced pregnancies and lactations exhibit glomerular hemodynamics, 24-hour protein excretions, and morphology similar to those of age-matched virgins. When repetitive pregnancies are superimposed on rats with the long-term hyperfiltration stimuli of uninephrectomy plus high dietary protein feeding, no worsening of the proteinuria occurs in comparison to virgin rats subjected to the same degree of renal ablation plus high protein. Although filtration and plasma flow rates are lower in these repetitively pregnant rats as compared with virgin rats, amino acid infusion revealed substantial renal reserve in the repetitively pregnant rats.

The possibility of conception in women of childbearing age emphasizes the need for counseling, and couples who want a child should be encouraged to discuss all implications, with the advice based on strict guidelines. If a recipient becomes pregnant, she must be monitored as a high-risk patient. Management requires particular attention to BP control, renal function, and all infection, as well as fetal surveillance. Just under 40% of conceptions do not go beyond the first trimester, but of those that do, greater than 90% end successfully. In most patients, renal hemodynamics improve during gestation, but permanent impairment occurs in 15% of pregnancies. Other patients may experience transient deterioration in late pregnancy (with or without proteinuria). Patients have a 30% chance of developing hypertension, preeclampsia, or both. Despite its pelvic location, the transplanted kidney rarely produces dystocia and experiences no apparent mechanical injury during vaginal delivery. Thus, cesarean section should be reserved for obstetric reasons only. Aseptic technique, bacterial prophylaxis even for trivial surgery, and steroid augmentation are necessary. Preterm deliveries occur in 45% to 60%, and intrauterine growth retardation in at least 20%, of gestations. Neonatal complications include respiratory distress syndrome, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, adrenocortical insufficiency, and infection. No predominant or frequent developmental abnormalities have been described, and data on infancy and childhood are encouraging. Future goals should be to improve prepregnancy assessment criteria, to reassess the rationale and implications of immunosuppression during pregnancy, and to monitor the remote effects of pregnancy on both renal prognosis and the offspring.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic renal failure patients maintained on dialysis have an increased risk for infection. This article summarizes research that has been done on the function of neutrophils (PMNs) and monocytes from chronic hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. The studies involving the HD patients showed that there is a decreased PMN in vitro chemotactic response, decreased C5a receptors on both PMNs and monocytes, and decreased oxidative metabolic responses of PMNs and monocytes to the chemotactic stimuli C5a and formyl-met-leu-phe (fMLP), but not to nonchemotactic factors. The results of studies involving phagocytosis have been conflicting and are discussed in this paper. Due to the basic principles of peritoneal dialysis, this treatment approach depletes the peritoneum of phagocytic cells, adversely affects the function of peritoneal WBCs, dilutes the existing opsonins, and alters the physiologic environment of the peritoneal cavity. Studies of peripheral PMN and monocyte function in CAPD patients have shown that, similar to HD patients, they also have decreased C5a receptors and decreased oxidative metabolic responses to the chemotactic factors C5a and fMLP. Although the factors contributing to the risk of infection in chronic dialysis patients are multifaceted, there are definitely alterations in PMN and monocyte function.\r"

  ".U": "87210120\r", 
  ".W": "Based on immunofluorescence findings, 232 patients with IgA nephropathy were classified into two groups; one consisted of 88 patients (38%) with IgA deposits in the glomerular capillary walls together with the mesangial deposits (capillary type), and the other consisted of 144 patients (62%) with deposits confined to the mesangium (mesangial type). Electron microscopic findings revealed dense deposits on the capillary walls (subepithelial, 50%; intramembranous, 65%; and subendothelial, 24%) in 37 of 46 patients with capillary type and six of 47 with mesangial type (P less than .001). Crescent formation observed in greater than or equal to 10% of glomeruli was more frequently found in patients with the capillary type (30/88, 34%) than those with the mesangial type (9/144, 6%) (P less than .01), especially higher in those with subepithelial deposits (15/26, 57%). The capillary type patients showed heavier proteinuria (1.7 +/- 0.2 g/d) than the mesangial type patients (0.6 +/- 0.1 g/d) (P less than .05). Thirteen of the 14 patients in an acute exacerbation phase, manifested by an abrupt increase in urinary protein and development of macroscopic hematuria, showed capillary type IgA deposits. The ratio of patients with normal renal function in the fifth year after apparent onset was lower in the capillary type (74.0%) than in the mesangial type patients (96.9%) (P less than .05). These findings suggest that capillary IgA deposition is closely related to clinical and histologic activities of IgA nephropathy and is considered to be an important factor responsible for the progression of the disease, possibly through crescent formation.\r"

Two benign microscopic adenomas were also found in the first group of patients. No malignant renal tumors or hemorrhagic complications were detected. The cause of the cyst formation is clearly related to chronic renal failure rather than dialysis per se, as one patient had cysts prior to CAPD and seven of 41 patients with end-stage renal disease in the predialysis era were found to have renal cysts on postmortem examination. This study shows that ACDK is not uncommon in patients with chronic renal failure treated by chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.\r"

That anion gap metabolic acidosis or visual impairment did not develop in this patient was attributed to documented prior ethanol ingestion (admission serum ethanol level of 158 mg/dL) and continued ethanol administration during hospitalization (sustained serum ethanol levels greater than 100 mg/dL). This case demonstrates the ability of ethanol to inhibit the metabolism of methanol to formic acid in humans. This inhibition was achieved without induction of lactic acidosis. Thus this case documents the efficacy of ethanol therapy in patients with methanol poisoning.\r"

  ".W": "Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is an X-linked recessive trait that occurs in association with congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AH) and developmental delay with or without congenital dystrophic myopathy. Several such patients have recently been reported to have cytological deletions of chromosome region Xp21 and/or of DNA markers that map near the locus for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in band Xp21. We have examined the initial family reported in the literature and, using prometaphase chromosome studies and Southern blot analysis with 13 different DNA probes derived from band Xp21, have found no deletions within this region of the X chromosome. When DNA samples from six other unrelated affected males were analyzed, four of them were found to have different-size deletions within Xp21. Thus, the form of GKD associated with AH and dystrophic myopathy exhibits significant genetic heterogeneity at the DNA level. No deletions were detected in two patients with isolated GK deficiency. Comparison of our molecular studies of unrelated patients with deletions of DNA segments allows us to define the region of Xp21 (between probes J-Bir and L1.4) that most likely contains the genes for GKD and AH. This location is distal to the DMD locus. The patients with progressive muscular dystrophy tended to have larger deletions that include markers known to derive from the DMD locus, while GKD/AH/dystrophic-myopathy patients without current evidence of deletion seemed to have a milder, nonprogressive form of congenital myopathy.\r"

  ".W": "In many ways, the elderly are a more heterogeneous group than the young, yet most pharmacokinetic studies of a new drug are carried out in healthy young volunteers. Based on a variety of age-related alterations in the gastrointestinal tract, one could postulate an a priori diminished absorption with age. In fact, absorption in old age is unchanged or even increased, as is observed with ciprofloxacin. Two comparative pharmacokinetic studies of oral ciprofloxacin found greater areas under the concentration-time curves and maximal serum concentrations in elderly than in young volunteers, which suggests better absorption (Ball et al, LeBel et al). Comparable results were also observed by Guay et al in an open study of 13 elderly patients. Smaller apparent volumes of distribution of ciprofloxacin were also noted in older than in younger volunteers. Several age-related changes in body composition may significantly affect the distribution of ciprofloxacin; the decrease in total body water plays a predominant role for this drug. For a drug that is mostly eliminated unchanged in urine, as ciprofloxacin is, the diminished glomerular filtration rate related to normal aging is the most significant factor to alter drug pharmacokinetics. A diminution of 55 to 60 percent in the total clearance of ciprofloxacin was noted in both studies comparing elderly and young persons. The decline in glomerular filtration rate observed with aging is well illustrated by the smaller renal clearance of ciprofloxacin obtained in this population. To prevent accumulation and eventual toxicity, it would seem appropriate to avoid dosage intervals shorter than 12 hours, especially in view of the lack of data concerning the effect that reduced glomerular filtration rate has on the elimination of metabolites of ciprofloxacin.\r"

  ".W": "Interactions between ciprofloxacin and other non-antibiotic agents occur; some can be predicted from in vitro results and general pharmacodynamic rules, whereas other interactions appear to be unpredictable. In the absorptive phase, neither food nor ranitidine, a histamine (H2)-receptor blocker, alters the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Pirenzipine, a cholinergic agent, and N-butyl-scopolaminium bromide delay the absorption of ciprofloxacin, whereas metclopramide accelerates absorption. Both magnesium- and aluminum-containing antacids significantly decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, probably through formation of a chelate complex. Patients receiving ciprofloxacin and theophylline simultaneously have higher serum theophylline levels than do recipients of theophylline alone. The interaction is probably due to the inhibition by ciprofloxacin of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize theophylline. Ciprofloxacin does not displace bilirubin from albumin; thus, interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound agents by ciprofloxacin are unlikely. Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors through reduction of their binding capacity and thus may potentiate convulsions induced by other agents. Cimetidine, a cytochrome P450 antagonist, affects metabolizable quinolones, and it is likely that it may affect ciprofloxacin's disposition after prolonged use. Currently, the only clinically significant interactions are the inactivation of ciprofloxacin by antacids and an increase in theophylline blood levels in the presence of ciprofloxacin. In the future, attention should be paid to other possible interactions.\r"

  ".W": "Ciprofloxacin and other newer quinolone antimicrobial agents exhibit increased potency and decreased frequency of spontaneous bacterial resistance in comparison with older analogues such as nalidixic acid. New and published observations on the mechanisms of action of and resistance to ciprofloxacin in Escherichia coli are presented and discussed. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified the A subunit of the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase as a target of ciprofloxacin and other quinolones. For a series of quinolones, inhibition of purified DNA gyrase correlated with antibacterial activity. The bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin is, in contrast to that of certain other quinolones, somewhat less affected by rifampin and cell starvation, suggesting the existence of a site of drug action in addition to DNA gyrase. The frequency of selection of spontaneous single-step resistance mutants of E. coli was more than 100-fold lower with ciprofloxacin than with nalidixic acid. Strains highly resistant to ciprofloxacin could, nevertheless, be selected by serial passage on drug-containing agar. Two mutations contributing to this high level of resistance were analyzed. One, designated cfxA, conferred a 16-fold increase in drug resistance and mapped in a location consistent with a gyrA mutation; similar increases in resistance to ciprofloxacin were seen with gyrA mutations selected for resistance to other quinolones. The other mutation, cfxB, conferred pleiotropic resistance to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol and appeared to be an allele of the multiple antibiotic resistance gene marA. The mutation cfxB was associated with a decreased amount of porin outer membrane protein OmpF, suggesting that drug permeation may occur in part through this channel. In summary, the A subunit of DNA gyrase is a target of ciprofloxacin and other quinolones. Ciprofloxacin resistance appears to occur both by mutation in this target and by alteration of drug permeation through the outer membrane of the cell.\r"

Patients received 500 to 750 mg of ciprofloxacin every 12 hours. In the predominantly older population studied, there were 13 patients with osteomyelitis, 24 diabetic patients with soft tissue infection and probable osteomyelitis, and 11 patients with other soft tissue infections. Infecting pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 25 patients, Serratia species in nine patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 13 patients, and other aerobic gram-negative rods in 21 patients. Clinical response (defined as resolution or improvement) was noted in 84 percent of patients with non-diabetic osteomyelitis, in 79 percent of patients with diabetic infections, and in 91 percent of patients with soft tissue infections. Microbiologic outcome was very favorable in 75 percent of cases, and Pseudomonas responded as well as any other pathogen. Pharmacokinetic properties of ciprofloxacin were evaluated in 12 patients, and the data were analyzed using both compartmental and non-compartmental analyses. Mean values for compartmental rate constants (hours-1) were as follows: absorption rate constant = 1.15; intercompartmental rate constants, k12 = 0.48, and k21 = 0.58; elimination rate constant = 0.46; distribution rate constant = 1.31; and terminal elimination rate constant = 0.19. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state/bioavailability was 196 liters and total body clearance/bioavailability was 45.9 liters/hour. The mean time to peak concentration was 1.3 hours. The mean peak concentration as determined by compartmental fitting (2.4 micrograms/ml) underestimated the observed peak (3.2 micrograms/ml) by 24.8 percent. Clearance of ciprofloxacin was similar regardless of the method used to fit the data, whereas the volume of distribution was significantly different when the two analysis techniques were compared. Ciprofloxacin was well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse reactions being rash, gastrointestinal intolerance, and increased levels of liver enzymes, each of which occurred in five patients.\r"

Serum ciprofloxacin concentrations and pharmacokinetic estimates remained unchanged throughout the study. Sputum ciprofloxacin concentrations exceeded those observed in serum. Sputum cultures revealed 43 P. aeruginosa (MIC90 = 2 micrograms/ml) and 15 P. cepacia (MIC90 = 16 micrograms/ml) strains. Sputum ciprofloxacin concentrations exceeded the MIC90 for P. aeruginosa approximately fivefold, yet only eight isolates were fully suppressed. Posttreatment sputum cultures revealed 35 P. aeruginosa (MIC90 = 16 micrograms/ml) and 15 P. cepacia (MIC90 = 16 micrograms/ml). All patients showed clinical improvement based upon the results of pulmonary function tests and an acute clinical efficacy score (median pre 49/post 60). No patients experienced drug-related toxicity. Ciprofloxacin monotherapy is effective for the acute treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. The development of pathogen resistance during oral therapy may limit its utility in ambulatory patients.\r"

  ".W": "Ciprofloxacin, a 4-quinolone bactericidal antimicrobial, has a high activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fact that ciprofloxacin can be administered orally would represent a cost-efficient advance in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis, most of whom must be treated frequently with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. In this study, 11 adult patients received 26 therapeutic courses of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg orally every 12 hours. In addition, a 13-year-old patient received 500 mg orally every 12 hours. The length of therapy was usually two weeks, but some patients received treatment for up to eight weeks. The mean serum concentration at two to three hours after administration of a dose was 3.68 micrograms/ml (range, 1.85 to 7.25 micrograms/ml). The mean trough level was 0.85 microgram/ml (range, 0.36 to 1.65 micrograms/ml). A comparable group of 11 patients matched by age and severity of disease were treated with conventional doses of tobramycin and azlocillin administered intravenously for at least two weeks. Sputum cultures from all the patients grew P. aeruginosa, except for one patient with Pseudomonas cepacia infection; the minimal inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin for these organisms ranged from 0.05 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. The clinical and microbiologic results obtained with these two antimicrobial regimens were similar. A therapeutic failure was noted in the patient infected with P. cepacia whose organism became resistant after one week of therapy (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 4.58 micrograms/ml). Emergence of resistant strains was not observed in any of the other patients.\r"

Assessments for efficacy and safety were made on treatment Days 7 and 14 and one week following completion of therapy, and pharmacokinetic data were collected on Days 1, 7, and 14. Fifteen of 28 evaluable patients showed clinical improvement, and none had clinical deterioration. The higher dosage of ciprofloxacin did not enhance the clinical response. Statistically significant, stepwise changes in clinical scores, pulmonary function, and sputum concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were noted, but regression toward initial values occurred by one week after treatment. Although all P. aeruginosa isolates were initially inhibited by 2 mg/liter of ciprofloxacin or less, 45 and 35 percent of isolates were resistant after 14 days of therapy and one week later, respectively. Outpatient oral ciprofloxacin therapy was commonly associated with clinical improvement in adult patients with cystic fibrosis who have chronic bronchopulmonary infection, regardless of the emergence of resistant P. aeruginosa, and adverse reactions were infrequent. Further studies must delineate the long-term consequences of the frequent emergence of bacterial resistance.\r"

In this study, the use of oral ciprofloxacin as sole therapy was evaluated in 18 patients with 39 infectious episodes; 13 episodes were classified as severe, 19 were classified as moderate, and seven were classified as mild. Patients ranged in age from eight to 36 years (mean, 23 years). Dosage varied according to severity of disease, body size, and the susceptibility of the Pseudomonas isolate to ciprofloxacin; the dose ranged from 750 to 2,250 mg daily (mean, 1,800 mg). Ten patients received one course of ciprofloxacin, and eight received repeated courses. The overall clinical response rate was 82 percent. There was a response to the initial treatment course in 96 percent of the patients. Those in whom therapy failed had been re-treated with ciprofloxacin and were severely ill. Failure to respond correlated poorly with pretreatment minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values (0.6 microgram/ml for failures versus 0.4 microgram/ml for responses). Pseudomonas could not be eradicated from the sputum of any of the patients, although there was a marked reduction in purulence and bacterial counts. In general, patients who did not require re-treatment for three months would again have susceptible organisms. When organisms became resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC greater than 2 micrograms/ml), they showed no concomitant new aminoglycoside or beta-lactam resistance. No serious toxicity occurred in any of the 39 episodes of treatment. In seven patients treated with combination therapy (tobramycin or azlocillin), the infecting organisms were reduced in number, but eradication of Pseudomonas generally could not be achieved. Increases in MIC occurred during combination therapy. Ciprofloxacin is a major advance in the treatment of bronchopulmonary infection in patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

Seventeen patients had infections (seven bronchitis, 10 pneumonia) caused by Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa; many of these patients were critically ill and were enrolled in the study because their pathogens were resistant to multiple drugs or because their infections had not responded to alternate antimicrobial therapy. All patients had favorable clinical responses, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. However, five of 12 strains of P. aeruginosa persisted during treatment; minimal inhibitory concentrations for these strains increased 4- to 16-fold as infections continued to resolve. One patient with Staphylococcus aureus infection also showed a response. Ciprofloxacin probably caused nausea, vomiting, or both in three of the 52 patients and possibly contributed to similar symptoms in another three patients (6 to 12 percent). Other possible adverse reactions, including central nervous system symptoms, were also observed but were not clearly drug-related.\r"

Most patients had serious, progressive underlying medical diseases and had multiple sites of colonization. Eleven had previously received parenteral vancomycin therapy. Duration of ciprofloxacin therapy was from seven to 28 days. Therapy was discontinued in eight patients because of minor adverse reactions (two patients) or serious events attributed to underlying diseases (six patients). These serious events included seizures in two patients with known seizure disorders. Of the remaining 14 courses of therapy, 11 (79 percent) were associated with eradication of MRSA colonization. For the 18 patients who received at least two weeks of therapy, results of cultures from 47 of the 56 colonized sites became negative. Recolonization with MRSA occurred in four patients within one month. Increased resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed in seven of the 22 treatment episodes; this was associated with treatment failure in three patients and successful therapy in one patient; therapy was discontinued for other reasons in three patients. For comparison, medical records of 31 patients whose clinical specimens revealed MRSA but who did not receive ciprofloxacin were reviewed. MRSA colonization (as opposed to infection) was not eradicated in any patient who received only a single drug or no specific therapy directed against MRSA; four of seven patients given combination therapy had colonization eradicated. Although there is the potential for increased resistance, ciprofloxacin is an important new option that can be used as a single agent for eradication of MRSA colonization. Additional study is needed to define the optimum use of ciprofloxacin as a single agent and in combination therapy for MRSA colonization and infection.\r"

Twenty-three patients (16 men and seven women) have been treated under the protocol (750 mg orally twice daily for 1.5 to six months), and 14 patients have completed therapy. All patients had either growth on bone cultures from an open or percutaneous biopsy, or an arthrocentesis to confirm the diagnosis. Involved sites included ankle or tibia (seven patients), vertebra (four patients), hip (five patients), metatarsal (four patients), phalanx (two patients), and metacarpal (one patient); 16 patients had chronic disease, and seven patients had acute disease. Patients had a total of 28 gram-negative bacilli, 12 gram-positive cocci, and one anaerobic gram-negative rod, for an average of 1.8 pathogens per patient. Eighteen of the 28 gram-negative bacilli were Pseudomonas species. The geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentration for all the gram-negative bacilli was 0.15 microgram/ml. The geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentration for the gram-positive isolates was 0.41 microgram/ml. All patients who completed therapy experienced a cure, with a mean follow-up of 6.1 months. Infections in all patients, except for two who are still taking ciprofloxacin, are resolving, both clinically and radiologically. One patient who was not eligible for the protocol experienced a superinfection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Side effects have included urticaria, lethargy, nausea, and transient elevations of liver and renal function test results. Overall, ciprofloxacin therapy was well tolerated. This study suggests that ciprofloxacin holds promise for the outpatient treatment of gram-negative osteomyelitis.\r"

The aerobic gram-negative bacilli were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), Serratia marcescens (five isolates), Escherichia coli (three isolates), Enterobacter species (three isolates), Proteus mirabilis (one isolate), Pseudomonas fluorescens (one isolate), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one isolate).

Nine infections were polymicrobial, involving aerobic gram-positive cocci or anaerobes in addition to aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Additional antibiotics to which the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were resistant were given when the additional organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Patients received 750 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for a mean of 62 days. Peak serum levels of ciprofloxacin were at least threefold higher than the MBCs in 20 of 24 patients. Twenty of 22 infections in which a full course of therapy was completed were without evidence of active disease at one to 17 months posttreatment. A sternotomy wound infection relapsed after eight weeks of therapy with a newly resistant S. marcescens strain, and an infection of a compound fracture relapsed two months posttreatment with a still sensitive P. aeruginosa strain. Toxicity was minimal in most patients: eosinophilia (six patients), nausea (eight patients), mild elevation in transaminase levels (three patients), pruritus (one patient), diarrhea (two patients), thrush (two patients), rash (two patients), and mild leukopenia (one patient). Two additional patients had severe side effects (vertigo in one and acute renal failure in another) that required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy.

Etiologic agents included Enterobacteriaceae (18 isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 isolates), and Staphylococcus aureus (four isolates). Seven of 14 (50 percent) ciprofloxacin-treated infections are cured at up to 13 months follow-up and three infections appear improved. Treatment failure or relapse has occurred in four patients. Sixteen patients received other antimicrobial therapy and 11 patients (65 percent) remain without infection and have healed wounds, with follow-up from one to 13 months. One patient has had a relapse, while improvement is apparent in four patients. Complications that occurred in this group included drug-related neutropenia (two patients), diarrhea (two patients), drug allergy (one patient), and catheter-related staphylococcal cellulitis (one patient). Oral ciprofloxacin therapy for chronic osteomyelitis caused by susceptible organisms appears to be as effective as other antimicrobial therapies.\r"

  ".W": "The term urinary tract infection encompasses a broad range of clinical entities, each with its own pathology and each requiring its own form of treatment. There are at least four different modes in which antimicrobial therapy may be prescribed for urinary tract infection: single-dose therapy aimed at patients with superficial mucosal infection; a conventional seven- to 14-day course of therapy; a prolonged four- to six-week course of therapy for patients with deep tissue infection; and low-dose prophylactic therapy. Increasingly, the response to single-dose therapy is being utilized to delineate the mode of therapy needed by a patient. Patients with underlying renal disease and/or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract are prone to the development of recurrent urinary tract infection, frequently with bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents conventionally employed to treat the infection. There has been a steady increase, even among otherwise normal persons with urinary tract infection, in the level of antimicrobial resistance exhibited by bacterial uropathogens to the drugs commonly used to treat these infections. The quinolones in general, and ciprofloxacin in particular, appear to be very promising for the treatment of urinary tract infection. It will be important to evaluate the performance of this drug in the four different therapeutic modes and in patients with renal dysfunction or anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract.\r"

Twenty-five elderly (mean age, 70.4 years) patients (24 men and one woman) were enrolled. Initial pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), Escherichia coli (five isolates), Enterobacter aerogenes (one isolate), Citrobacter freundii (one isolate), Serratia species (two isolates), Proteus vulgaris (one isolate), and enterococcus (one isolate). Patients received 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally twice daily for one week (mean, 6.98 days). Results of urine cultures obtained during therapy were negative in all cases, and at one week post-therapy, 21 of 25 (84 percent) infections were cured. Four patients experienced a relapse with P. aeruginosa. Repeat urine culture specimens were obtained at four to six weeks from 14 patients who had cures at one week post-therapy, and seven continued to have cures. Three patients had late relapses with P. aeruginosa, E. coli, or Serratia marcescens, and four were reinfected with new strains. Five patients who received concomitant oral antacids had lower mean peak and trough serum ciprofloxacin levels than did patients not receiving antacids (p less than 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Mild adverse effects were seen in seven patients: eosinophilia (one patient), eosinophilia and reduced white blood cell count (one patient), crystalluria (one patient), granular casts (one patient), elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels (one patient), and nausea (two patients), but none warranted discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy. P. aeruginosa isolates from two patients who experienced a relapse showed increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations from 0.13 to 0.5 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, to ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics. Orally administered ciprofloxacin was a safe and effective therapy for complicated urinary tract infections in elderly patients.\r"

Three of these patients were found to be reinfected with their primary pathogens when culture specimens were obtained again three to four weeks later. The two patients who received treatment that was classified as having failed had urine cultures that persistently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Superinfections occurred in eight patients, four with diabetes and four with underlying central nervous system disease. Adverse reactions required discontinuation of therapy in two patients. Although the rates of reinfection and superinfection were somewhat high, these patients had a high frequency of underlying diseases that predisposed them to recurrent or difficult-to-treat infections. Despite these shortcomings, ciprofloxacin is a welcome addition to the oral antibiotic regimen for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant urinary infections.\r"

Increasingly widespread plasmid-mediated resistance to the penicillins limits the use of these agents in the treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Hemophilus ducreyi infections. Chromosomally mediated antimicrobial resistance to the tetracyclines, penicillins, erythromycins, and sulfonamides further limits therapeutic options in the treatment of gonorrhea, and plasmid-mediated resistance to sulfonamides and tetracyclines is frequent in H. ducreyi infections. In patients with Chlamydia trachomatis infections, effective regimens that can more easily be complied with (shorter duration, less frequent dosing) are needed, as are effective alternative regimens for use in pregnancy and in infants. In selected STDs that are polymicrobial (pelvic inflammatory disease and bacterial vaginosis, for example) or that often present simultaneously (gonorrhea-chlamydia, gonorrhea-syphilis, chancroid-syphilis), single-drug regimens that are effective against several genital pathogens would be ideal. Only limited therapeutic alternatives are available for some STDs, especially in pregnant women or in patients with penicillin allergy. Thus, antimicrobial resistance, drug toxicity, poor compliance, limited alternatives in pregnancy or allergy, and the lack of single agents possessing a broad spectrum of activity against multiple genital pathogens limit currently available therapy.\r"

Although single-dose and short-course treatment of chancroid have been described, the increasing resistance of Hemophilus ducreyi to antimicrobial agents requires continuing evaluation of new therapies. Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with excellent in vitro efficacy against H. ducreyi. A double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing a single-dose ciprofloxacin regimen (500 mg) and a three-day regimen of ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) with a three-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160 and 800 mg, respectively, twice daily) for the treatment of chancroid. The three-day ciprofloxacin regimen successfully eradicated H. ducreyi, and resulted in rapid clinical improvement in all 40 patients followed, with no failures. The other two regimens were also effective, but bacteriologic and clinical failure occurred in two and three patients following treatment with single-dose ciprofloxacin and three days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. All patients with buboes had resolution of lesions. There were no significant adverse effects associated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All three regimens are effective therapy for chancroid and H. ducreyi infections. If resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole becomes widespread, ciprofloxacin may become a first-line therapy for chancroid. This study also demonstrates the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in soft tissue infection.\r"

The problem with this combination regimen is inactivity against Campylobacter jejuni strains and other bacterial enteropathogens showing in vitro resistance to the drug. Resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole among enteric pathogens has occurred frequently in certain areas of the world. A study of the in vitro susceptibility of enteric bacterial pathogens isolated from multiple countries was recently performed. The minimal inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin required to inhibit 90 percent of the 210 bacterial enteropathogens ranged from 0.25 micrograms/ml for C. jejuni to 0.016 micrograms/ml for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella. In a clinical trial carried out in a United States student population that acquired diarrhea while in Mexico, it was shown that ciprofloxacin was as effective as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and both were significantly (p less than 0.001) more effective than placebo. The average duration of diarrhea was 29 or 20 hours after initiation of treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively, compared with 81 hours in the placebo group. The antimicrobial agents were more efficacious than placebo in treating diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli, invasive enteropathogens, and unknown pathogens. Ciprofloxacin and the quinolone derivatives are uniquely suited to the therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea in areas where C. jejuni is commonly found and where trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant strains regularly occur.\r"

Mean minimal inhibitory concentrations against 50 percent (MIC50) and 90 percent (MIC90) of staphylococcal strains were 0.32 and 0.59 mg/liter, respectively. The drug was equally active against staphylococcal strains resistant and susceptible to methicillin and/or gentamicin. The range of MIC50 and MIC90 values for Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium was between 0.25 and 1 mg/liter and 1 to 8 mg/liter, respectively. Ciprofloxacin inhibited group A and group B streptococci at concentrations of 0.5 to 2 mg/liter. Group C and G strains were less susceptible (MICs, 2 to 16 mg/liter). Penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci and the Viridans streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 to 4 mg/liter. MIC50 and MIC90 values of ciprofloxacin against Corynebacterium, including group JK, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci were 1 and 8 mg/liter, respectively, and against anaerobic gram-positive rods, were 2 and 16 mg/liter, respectively. Listeria monocytogenes strains were inhibited by 0.12 to 2 mg/liter. Ciprofloxacin showed bactericidal activity against staphylococci and streptococci in minimal bactericidal concentration tests and in killing kinetic studies. The in vitro activity of the drug was influenced neither by the method employed, by the medium used, by the pH of the medium, nor by the size of the inoculum. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in staphylococci in a step-wise manner. First-step mutants usually showed a fourfold to eightfold decrease in susceptibility. Contrary to the situation in gram-negative organisms, resistant mutants did not show reduced growth.\r"

Patients had \"difficult-to-treat\" infections, i.e., respiratory infections (15), abscesses (four intraabdominal, three lung, two soft tissue, and one intrahepatic), deep soft tissue infections (10), chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (nine), upper urinary tract infection (five), malignant external otitis (two), catheter-related bacteremia (two), and infectious endocarditis (one). Thirty patients (56 percent) had serious associated medical problems.

Minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.003 to 2 micrograms/ml. In 39 patients, the isolated microorganisms were multi-resistant; resistance included ceftazidime and amikacin in 32 patients. In 24 patients, ciprofloxacin was given exclusively by the intravenous route at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours; in 30 patients, treatment was completed after discontinuation of the parenteral drug with the oral preparation of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours. The duration of parenteral treatment ranged from six to 40 days (mean, 14.9 days). A successful clinical response was observed in 49 patients (91 percent), while five (9 percent) failed to show a response.

  ".W": "Dual individualization is the integration of patient-specific pharmacokinetic parameters with the pharmacodynamics (concentration versus response) of the infecting pathogen. This technique allows description of the time of in vivo bacterial eradication, and allows estimation of optimal dosages using small numbers of seriously ill patients. In an ongoing study, 11 patients with nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were given 200 mg of intravenous ciprofloxacin every 12 hours. Ten blood samples were taken after the first dose, with additional peaks and troughs measured on Day 4 and at the end of treatment. Bacterial isolates had minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by standard microdilution techniques. In the 11 patients, there were 14 bacterial isolates, of which seven were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the remainder were other pathogens. Ciprofloxacin MICs ranged from 0.008 to 1.0 microgram/ml. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in these patients varied with renal function, and average peak serum concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 4.9 micrograms/ml. Eradication of bacteria from tracheal aspirates occurred between Days 1 and 7, except in four patients in whom the organism persisted. Correlations were observed between the day of eradication and the length of time ciprofloxacin concentrations remained above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Essentially all bacteria with MICs of less than 0.25 were eradicated. Of the non-eradicated bacteria, most had either MICs of more than 0.25, or less than 100 percent time above the MIC. The clinical response was satisfactory. It is concluded that 200 mg of intravenous ciprofloxacin every 12 hours is highly effective for bacteria with MICs less than 0.25 microgram/ml, but higher dosages may be required to eradicate organisms with higher MICs.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a 200-mg intravenous dose of ciprofloxacin were studied in normal volunteers and in an in vitro dynamic model that exposes bacteria to changing concentrations of the drug in a neutropenic setting. Peak ciprofloxacin concentrations in vivo averaged 3.2 micrograms/ml. The terminal serum elimination half-life averaged 4.2 hours. The volume of distribution of ciprofloxacin was large and consistent with extensive extravascular distribution. Slightly less than half of the dose was recovered unchanged in urine by 48 hours after infusion. The median serum bactericidal titer against a strain of Escherichia coli was 1:16 or more for at least six hours after infusion, but was only 1:2 against a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa immediately after the end of the infusion. Pharmacodynamic studies in the in vitro model with a simulated regimen of 200 mg administered intravenously every 12 hours demonstrated rapid and complete killing of this strain of E. coli following the first 200-mg \"dose.\" For the strain of P. aeruginosa, an initial bactericidal effect was observed due to the eradication of susceptible subpopulations of bacteria; however, regrowth of resistant organisms was observed. These data suggest that a regimen of 200 mg administered intravenously every 12 hours results in rapid killing of susceptible bacteria. Higher doses or combination therapy may be required to prevent the emergence of resistant P. aeruginosa in this model and in the setting of neutropenia.\r"

Twelve patients were also given ciprofloxacin orally after initial intravenous therapy. The mean duration of total therapy was 31 days. The overall clinical response rate was 87 percent, and the bacteriologic response rate was 70 percent. Favorable responses were observed in 10 of 12 patients with osteomyelitis/septic arthritis; seven of eight with soft tissue infection; four of four with pneumonitis; one of two with cystic fibrosis; and four of four with urinary tract infections. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in three Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Toxicity was minor: phlebitis occurred in six patients, nausea in six, and rash in one. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin or intravenous ciprofloxacin followed by oral ciprofloxacin is a safe and effective therapy for serious infections.\r"

  ".W": "This report presents the results of 146 clinical trials of the oral form of ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent active against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The safety of ciprofloxacin was assessed in 2,829 patients, most of whom were treated in the United States, and the analysis of efficacy was based on data from 3,981 patients evaluated through June 1986. In general, the patients received ciprofloxacin at a dosage of 250 to 750 mg every 12 hours; the median dose was 500 mg twice daily. Dose-ranging studies in male patients with urinary tract infections indicated that a regimen of 500 or 750 mg twice daily was not substantially more effective than a regimen of 250 mg twice daily. Forty-four double-blind, controlled trials were conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin with those of standard therapeutic agents in the treatment of infections of the urinary tract, skin and skin structure, respiratory tract, and bone. Ciprofloxacin at 250 mg twice daily was as effective as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 160/800 mg twice daily in the treatment of urinary tract infections. Orally administered ciprofloxacin in a regimen of 750 mg twice daily was shown to be as effective as cefotaxime administered intravenously at 2 g three times daily in the treatment of infections of the skin and skin structure. When compared with ampicillin for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, ciprofloxacin was as effective in resolving or improving markedly the signs and symptoms of infection and eradicated a higher percentage of causative organisms. Adverse reactions considered probably or possibly related to the drug were reported for 16.2 percent of the patients treated; most were of only mild or moderate intensity and resolved after therapy was completed. Emergence of resistant organisms associated with ciprofloxacin therapy has been reported infrequently.\r"

In addition, the efficacy of these newer quinolones has been studied in animal models of pneumonia, endocarditis, meningitis, skin and soft tissue infections, and a variety of other systemic infections. Although certain limitations are associated with animal models of infection, properly performed studies clearly have the potential to provide guidelines for evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of some infections in humans.\r"

The baseline aldosterone level was low for the degree of hyperkalemia. Renin/aldosterone stimulation testing was performed by intravenous injection of 80 mg of furosemide followed by four hours of upright posture. This study showed low baseline renin and aldosterone levels and inadequate renin and aldosterone stimulation. Three patients were subsequently treated with fludrocortisone (0.1 to 0.2 mg per day), with normalization of serum potassium levels. It is concluded that hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is responsible for hyperkalemia in some patients with AIDS and that treatment with fludrocortisone is effective in these cases.\r"

Although a variety of deep-seated candidal infections have been reported, Candida osteomyelitis has rarely been described. Five patients with Candida osteomyelitis are presented, and the 32 adult cases previously reported are reviewed. Candida osteomyelitis is noted as a simultaneous occurrence or late manifestation of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. Osteomyelitis may not be prevented by a course of amphotericin B adequate to control the acute episode of disseminated candidiasis, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. Less commonly, Candida osteomyelitis presents as a postoperative wound infection. Like bacterial osteomyelitis, the most common presenting symptom is local pain. The insidious progression of infection, the nonspecificity of laboratory data, and the failure to recognize Candida as a potential pathogen may lead to diagnostic delay. Diagnosis can be made by either open biopsy or closed needle aspiration. Successful therapeutic regimens have employed combinations of antifungal therapy (most often amphotericin B) with surgical debridement when indicated. It is anticipated that osteomyelitis will become a more commonly recognized manifestation of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis.\r"

Major clinical manifestations include: recurrent bleeding from mucosal telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations; hypoxemia, cerebral embolism, and brain abscess due to pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas; high-output congestive heart failure and portosystemic encephalopathy from hepatic arteriovenous malformations; and a variety of neurologic symptoms due to central nervous system angiodysplasia. Therapy is primarily supportive, consisting of iron supplementation and blood transfusion. Septal dermoplasty and oral estrogens may allow prolonged remission of epistaxis, but permanent surgical cure of gastrointestinal bleeding is rarely feasible because of diffuse angiodysplasia of the alimentary tract. Ligation, resection, or embolization may be indicated for pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. The prognosis and survival of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are favorable, providing treatable complications are accurately diagnosed.\r"

  ".U": "87210301\r", 
  ".W": "Although recognizing that the subject is controversial, most authors of textbooks about diagnostic radiology conclude that chest radiography is of little value for either confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis of emphysema. Yet several reports in the literature show a high degree of accuracy in the interpretation of films for presence of this disease. Some of the controversy results from continuing confusion over the current definition of emphysema in terms of lung structure rather than symptoms or physiologic evidence relating to impaired ventilation. Many autopsy studies have shown that emphysema is often present at postmortem examination and can involve as much as 30 percent of the lung tissue, even in subjects with no respiratory symptoms or impairment during life. Since radiographs deal with structure rather than function, interpreters of chest films should have the intention to recognize the presence of structural emphysema. The correct recognition of emphysema is useful even in a patient without symptoms, and the ability to exclude this diagnosis in symptomatic patients is of equal, if not greater value. The degree of success reported in various studies depends upon the criteria used and the strictness applied by the authors in matching their interpretations to the presence or absence of structural emphysema. This review of existing literature deals solely with papers in which radiographic observations have been related to morphologic evidence of emphysema in inflation-fixed autopsy lung specimens. It identifies reasons for discrepancies among reports and emphasizes the very high predictive value of validated radiographic criteria. Applications of radiographic interpretation both for diagnosis and for exclusion of emphysema in clinical situations are described.\r"

On one side a microanastomosis was made by standard surgical technique of 8-0 nylon; the other side was \"welded\" either after doing the anastomosis with 8-0 sutures or without any anastomotic sutures. Histologic sections obtained from rats' uteri treated with conventional and laser surgery showed that on the laser-treated sutured side there was less necrosis and inflammatory and giant cells. The animals that underwent laser welding without suturing had no necrosis, suppuration, or granulation; giant cells were not present. We conclude that in the tissue from the laser-treated animals, when compared with conventional and laser-with-suture surgery, histologic features indicate healing process by primary intention via an aseptic noninflammatory reaction.\r"

Another group receiving the vehicle alone served as controls. Prostaglandin D2 administration resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in renal artery flow, urine output, creatinine clearance, plasma renin activity, sodium excretion, potassium excretion, and pulmonary artery pressure. A significant decrease occurred in renal resistance and arterial PO2. There were no appreciable changes in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, hematocrit, platelet count, arterial pH, and PCO2. In the vehicle control group, all other parameters remained relatively stable, except for some increase in the mean arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, and potassium excretion. The results of this study suggest that prostaglandin D2 administered intravenously at levels lower than those required to produce adverse pulmonary and systemic effects will improve the renal blood flow and function.\r"

Comparing women with maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values less than 0.4 multiple of the median against those with normal values (0.4 to 2.49 multiples of the median) also revealed no significant differences with respect to presence or absence of a variety of antepartum or intrapartum complications.

The addition of these antisera failed to inhibit prolactin secretion in the face of 10(-5) mol/L gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Coincubation of antiserum to the beta-subunit of luteinizing hormone or the beta-subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone at a 1:10,000 dilution failed to inhibit basal prolactin secretion; however, coincubation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with antiserum to the beta-subunit of either luteinizing hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone significantly inhibited the release of prolactin. These observations led us to conclude that basal and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-mediated prolactin secretion can be affected by gonadotropin subunits.\r"

We found less intensity of fetal vessel fibronectin staining in villi from placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies than in those of normal pregnancies (p less than 0.02, Mann-Whitney U test).

A sufficient amount of chorionic villi for deoxyribonucleic acid analysis by oligonucleotide hybridization was obtained in all cases tested but one, with a success rate of 99.7%. The percentage of fetal loss, expressed as proportion of continuing pregnancies, was 4.8%. To verify the results, we carried out amniocyte deoxyribonucleic acid analysis in all the continuing pregnancies for the first 100 cases and in those in which trophoblast deoxyribonucleic acid analysis showed the heterozygous state for beta-thalassemia for the second 200 cases. At the beginning we had two cases of decidual contamination in such an amount to cause misdiagnosis. Successively more careful elimination of decidual tissue from villi avoided avoided this pitfall. These results indicate that chorionic villus sampling by a rigid forceps is a reliable and relatively safe method for fetal diagnosis of genetic diseases by deoxyribonucleic acid analysis.\r"

We propose the use of digital radiography using single exposure as an alternative to conventional urography. This technique allows significant dose reduction while visualizing the entire urinary tract. It can be performed on most current-generation computerized tomographic scanners. In addition to dose reduction, the ability to manipulate, magnify, and avoid repeat exposures makes this an attractive alternative to the conventional film-screen technique.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and microbiologic risk factors for postpartum endometritis were studied prospectively in 77 patients undergoing cesarean section without antibiotic prophylaxis at Harbor-University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. Intraoperative cultures were obtained from the amniotic fluid, lower uterine segment, and abdominal wound for isolation of genital mycoplasmas, aerobes, and anaerobes. Postsection endometritis developed in 21 (27%) patients and was significantly associated with presence of either high-virulence bacteria (predominantly, coliforms, streptococci, anaerobic cocci, and bacteroides) (35% to 60% versus 10% to 24%; p less than 0.05) or Ureaplasma urealyticum (15% to 42% versus 0% to 10%; p less than 0.05) at any site compared with afebrile women. Multivariate analysis identified primary cesarean section, younger maternal age, presence of ruptured membranes, and presence of Ureaplasma as significant risk factors independent of other confounding variables (p less than 0.01). It is suggested that genital mycoplasmas could play a primary role in some cases of postsection endometritis or that they are cofactors or markers for the presence of other high-virulence aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.\r"

Several biometric measurements were obtained including the transverse cerebellar diameter, the biparietal diameter, the occipitofrontal diameter, and the calculated head circumference. Curvilinear relationships were found between the transverse diameter of the cerebellum (measured in millimeters), and the gestational age (R2 = 0.948; P = 0.001), the biparietal diameter (R2 = 0.956; P = 0.0001), and the head circumference (R2 = 0.969; P = 0.0001). A nomogram of cerebellar measurements estimating gestational age and predicting the biparietal diameter and head circumference was generated. Throughout pregnancy the establishment of normative cerebellar measurements allows for the estimation of gestational age that is independent of the shape of the fetal head and offers potential for evaluation of abnormal fetal growth and anomalous development of the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of early pregnancy glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c concentration and the incidence of congenital anomalies and spontaneous abortions were evaluated in women presenting for prenatal care with insulin-treated diabetes in a population whose glycemic control was poor. Thirty-one abnormal outcomes were seen in 83 pregnancies (37%). There were 22 spontaneous abortions and nine major congenital anomalies. No woman with an early pregnancy hemoglobin A1C value less than 9.5% had an infant with a congenital anomaly and a single woman experienced a spontaneous abortion (4%). Conversely, in women with an early pregnancy hemoglobin A1C value greater than or equal to 9.5%, congenital anomalies occurred in 24% and spontaneous abortion in 35%. Outcomes of pregnancies in type 1 and type 11 diabetic women were comparable. A strong statistical relationship between hemoglobin A1C and adverse pregnancy outcomes was demonstrated. These results strongly suggest that poor glycemic control during early pregnancy adversely influences pregnancy outcomes; the greater the degree of poor control, the greater the impact on pregnancy outcome. The data further justify the need for preconceptional control in diabetic woman and for careful evaluation of the fetus during pregnancy in the woman with insulin-treated diabetes.\r"

A 50% recurrence rate in the group of patients in whom single-dose treatment failed was compared with a 5% recurrence rate in the group cured by single-dose therapy, which indicates that failure with single-dose antimicrobial therapy can serve as a therapeutic test to identify patients at high risk for recurrent bacteriuria and its sequelae during pregnancy. It is concluded that single-dose antimicrobial therapy is a safe and effective way to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant patients without urologic problems in their history.\r"

The volume measured reflects both placental cellular mass and placental circulating blood volume.

Sixteen women (7.5%) developed febrile morbidity only, 10 (4.7%) developed major pelvic infection requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy, and neither clinical nor laboratory adverse reactions of significance were observed. Anemia, diabetes, and additional surgical procedures were associated with a significantly increased incidence of postoperative infection; no regimen was more protective for women with or without these risk factors. Infections almost doubled hospital stay and the charges for health care. Diagnosis-related group reimbursement would have been more than $1,300 less than the mean hospital charge for women who developed infection. Utilizing cefazolin for prophylaxis and reserving cefoxitin and cefotaxime for therapy is cost and antimicrobial efficient.\r"

More than 50 articles published in 1950 to 1986 containing relevant information provided the data for this purpose. In 8041 American and European, otherwise uninterrupted diabetic pregnancies ascertained through hospital records, mostly not specified as to the time at first examination and the interval covered, there occurred 10.0% +/- 0.3% spontaneous abortions. The frequency was significantly greater (12.7% +/- 0.7%), however, in the 1890 pregnancies observed during specifically stated extended periods. The records are marred by the lack of control pregnancies and the great absence of information regarding the variables and confounding factors that influence the spontaneous abortion rate. Nevertheless, since the results are very similar to those found in general clinical material it is most probable that there is no excess of spontaneous abortion in diabetic pregnancy. The recent claims of such an increase may have been based on the pregnant women in these studies being seen earlier and being closely examined for longer periods than has usually been the case and to the enrollment in the studies of women with unrepresentatively great risk of reproductive mishap.\r"

The increased risk of endometrial carcinoma seems to be related to both the dosage and duration of unopposed estrogen treatment. Until very recently, the morbidity and costs that result from the need for endometrial biopsy because of abnormal bleeding and from the need for hysterectomy due to hyperplasia have been ignored, but recent data suggest that they are likely to be considerable. Progestogens are known to protect against endometrial hyperstimulation, but the optimal duration of therapy each month and the maximally protective agent and dose remain to be determined. Estrogen replacement therapy may reduce the risk of arterial disease; however, the comparative effects of the various preparations, as well as their respective mechanisms of action, must be subjected to further study.\r"

Moderate bleeding has occurred in some patients with an intact uterus but can be controlled by the addition of a progestogen. The incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and breast tenderness has been relatively low, and minor side effects (such as fluid retention) have been limited. Several investigators have evaluated skin irritation resulting from the systems. Some erythema has been reported, but serious ulcerations or sloughing did not occur. A survey of patient attitudes comparing oral administration and transdermal systems indicated a preference for the transdermal method.\r"

Five patients have undergone penetrating keratoplasty for progressive primary Acanthamoeba keratitis (four patients) or recurrent infection (one patient) after maximal medical therapy. Two patients who began medical therapy less than three weeks after the onset of symptoms have done well. Early diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis appears critical for successful medical therapy.
