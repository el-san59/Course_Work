  ".W": "To overcome the difficulties arising in the management of cold nodules of the thyroid--many are unnecessarily resected because of the risk of malignancy--fine needle aspiration cytology was used in the assessment of thyroid lesions in 113 patients. Aspirates were categorised into three groups as follows: group (i), consistent with simple goitre or cyst; group (ii), suspicious of underlying cellular lesion or tumour; group (iii), malignant. Resections for simple goitre were reduced from eight of 14 (40%) to two of 42 (3%) over three years, and the yield of neoplastic lesions coming to surgery as a result of aspiration increased from two of 12 (16%) to nine of 14 (69%) over the same period. It is concluded that fine needle aspiration cytology is an effective means of discriminating between simple and neoplastic thyroid lesions. This permits more appropriate patient management and a beneficial saving of resections for simple goitre. False negative diagnoses (two cases) in our series are of more concern than false positive results, but can be minimised by careful attention to sampling and cytological detail.\r"

This system permitted grades II and III ductal breast carcinoma to be distinguished reliably from grade I tumours but no correlation with the lymph node state of patients with breast carcinoma was shown. Some overlap between the scores for grade I ductal carcinomas and some benign lesions was found, and this underlines a need for caution in the reporting of such equivocal aspirates. No cytological features that distinguished reliably ductal from lobular carcinoma were identified but the same spectrum of severity of cytological abnormality in the ductal and lobular carcinoma aspirates was seen. This system may be of prognostic value in the assessment of lobular carcinoma which has hitherto defied histological grading.\r"

Firstly, mitotic activity was studied in paraffin wax embedded sections of normal non-pregnant endometrium and early pregnancy decidua stained with phloxine-tartrazine. Secondly, the monoclonal antibody Ki67 was applied to cryostat sections of similar tissues. Endometrial stromal granulocytes were identified by their labelling with NKH1, Dako T11, UCHL1 or Dako-LC. The percentage of cases in which endometrial stromal granulocytes showed mitosis was 25%, 75%, 86%, and 93%, respectively in proliferative, early secretory, mid secretory, and late secretory phases, and 14% in early decidua. There were at most one or two endometrial stromal granulocytes in mitosis per 10 high power fields. Double labelled cells were present in small numbers in proliferative endometrium and in moderate numbers in secretory endometrium. Only a few cells in early decidua double labelled with Ki67/T11; moderate numbers of cells double labelled with Ki67/Dako-LC. It is concluded that proliferative activity does occur in endometrial stromal granulocytes and is particularly prominent in the late secretory phase.\r"

PLAP A and PLAP C were determined together with an existing marker, CA125 in 397 serial samples from 87 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Retrospective assessment showed the sensitivity to increase from 73% with CA125 alone, to 88% using CA125 and PLAP A, and to 93% with all three markers in 261 samples from the patients with known active disease at the time of sampling. When the results for all 397 samples were included in the analysis, however, the specificity, sensitivity, accuracy and predictive powers of this monoclonal antibody were not sufficiently high to assist in the prospective follow up of patients with ovarian cancer. This was due to a significant number of false positive and false negative results. Our data indicate that PLAP A or PLAP C estimation with H17E2 may, therefore, only be of value in the management of those patients with known active disease who are already known to be \"marker positive\" for this antigen.\r"

Biopsy specimens and brushings were assayed by flow cytometry for c-myc oncogene antigen and papillomavirus antigen expression and rate of cell division (by measuring DNA content). Results obtained from analysis of specimens and brushings were similar in terms of c-myc antigen and total DNA content, but when the percentages of nuclei from biopsy and brush specimens staining positively with antibody to papilloma viral antigens were compared, brush specimens gave consistently higher percentages than biopsy specimens. More specimens from normal epithelium were c-myc antigen positive (five of eight, (63%) than specimens from CIN II or III (two of 10, 20%), or invasive carcinoma (0%). No association was found between c-myc antigen expression and cell division. HPV antigen positive specimens were found to contain more dividing cells than negative specimens.\r"

Nine tumors (eight neuroblastomas and one ganglioneuroblastoma of composite type) contained neuroblastoma cells with positive nuclei for N-myc protein. Microscopic examination showed that most of the positive neuroblastoma cells seemed to be immature, with no apparent neuronal differentiation. Nine of 11 tumours with amplified N-myc gene copies exhibited tumour cells with positive immunostaining for the N-myc gene product, while none of the seven non-N-myc amplified cases contained immunoreactive tumour cells. The survival of the patients positive for N-myc protein was significantly low compared with that of the negative ones. It is concluded that immunohistochemical staining for the N-myc gene product will facilitate prediction of the prognosis of patients with neuroblastoma.\r"

There was a striking association between tolerance and Eagle's optimum dosage effect, particularly among strains that displayed tolerance in both the stationary and the logarithmic growth phases. Sequential viable counts on representative strains showed that reliance on the arbitrary criterion of bactericidal activity of 99.9% reduction of the original inoculum after 24 hours' exposure may occasionally lead to difficulties in the recognition of penicillin tolerance. In general, however, the 99.9% killing criterion provided a useful discriminator between strains that were rapidly killed by penicillin and those (tolerant strains) in which the bactericidal activity was much reduced.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of the thromboplastin international sensitivity index (ISI) to the interlaboratory coefficient of variation (CV) of the international normalised ratio (INR) with individual reagents was assessed. In theory the precision of the INR should increase with lower ISI values. An empirical relation has been established between the ISI, the INR, and its CV for two rabbit thromboplastins used in sufficient numbers for analysis in the United Kingdom. This was based on the cumulative data from the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme (NEQAS) surveys over two years beginning in 1986. The actual precision achieved in NEQAS for the two reagents depends on the ISI value of the thromboplastin and it agreed closely with the figure predicted by the empirical model. The findings show that the ISI value of a thromboplastin strongly influences the interlaboratory variability of the INR obtained with it. The CV of the INR approximates to the CV of the prothrombin ratio multiplied by the ISI. Manufacturers of thromboplastin should therefore be encouraged to produce reagents showing good precision of results reported as simple prothrombin ratios and a low ISI value to avoid impairment in precision when ratio results are transformed to INR.\r"

  ".W": "The performance of coagulometers in the National Quality Assessment Scheme (NEQAS) surveys of the prothrombin time conducted between 1986 and 1987 was reviewed. There were sufficient data for analysis for eight types of coagulometer used with a single type of thromboplastin reagent and one instrument with an alternative reagent. The overall reliability efficacy of each instrument was evaluated by determining the orthogonal regression slope parameters for prothrombin time (PT) and international normalised ratios (INR) using the manual technique as the reference method. Seven of the eight types of coagulometer tended to overestimate the INR. A pattern frequently observed with coagulometers, and difficult to regulate, was a trend to underestimate INR below 3.0 and overestimate higher INR. Overestimation of INR values over 3.0 was particularly pronounced with three types of instrument (Fibrintimer, Lancer, KC4/10). The KC4/10 was used by a sufficient number of participants to permit analysis of the performance of individual instruments. Within instrument differences were similar to those produced by different types of coagulometers. Thromboplastin reagents affected the INR values obtained with coagulometers. The study indicates that each local reagent-instrument combination must be calibrated by the participant to obtain reliable INR values. The use of a general correction factor for a local PT system seems to be invalid owing to the considerable variation in performance of individual coagulometers. The two best guides to the choice of coagulometer may be the deviation from the manual result and precision estimated by the coefficient of variation of the INR.\r"

This contrasts with the findings in invasive aspergillosis where there is fibrosis and a granulomatous response to the Aspergillus hyphae. The hyphae are seen in giant cells using fungal stains. In the saprophytic infections aspergilloma and allergic Aspergillus sinusitis there is no tissue invasion or destruction. Aspergillus infections of the nose and paranasal sinuses often require biopsy for accurate diagnosis. As treatment varies pathologists need to be able to distinguish the different patterns of infection.\r"

Gastric mucosa was found in 13 diverticula (19%), 10 from the symptomatic group and three from the incidental cases, of which eight showed active gastritis affecting the heterotopic mucosa. Specific staining showed spiral bacteria with the typical morphology of C pylori adherent to gastric mucosa in four of the diverticula showing active gastritis.

The incidence of pulmonary embolism (9% of all necropsies) was unchanged during the period studied. In contrast, pulmonary embolism as the \"sole\" cause of death increased (p less than 0.0005). Although most pulmonary emboli were the immediate cause of death, the clinical diagnosis was often missed (in 84% of all cases). Furthermore, such clinically missed diagnoses increased over the years (p less than 0.005), especially in patients with heart disease and cancer.

This change may be influenced by progesterone. One group of endometrial adenocarcinomas exhibited binding patterns similar to those seen in secretory endometrium and this may be related to progesterone receptor state. Expression of fucose containing glycosubstances was identified in half of the carcinomas but not in the normal control tissue, thus indicating that a change in fucosylation occurs with endometrial neoplasia. None of the lectin binding patterns, however, correlated with variables in the patients themselves or within the tumours.\r"

Three patterns of immunostaining were apparent: (i) nuclear staining alone; (ii) staining of the nucleus and basal cytoplasm; and (iii) staining of the entire cell. Of the 21 cases of mucinous cystadenoma, 11 showed nuclear staining alone, and a further case showed additional weak staining of the basal cytoplasm. Nuclear staining alone was not present in any of the 17 borderline mucinous tumours examined. Strong staining of the nucleus and basal cytoplasm was seen in 16 of these borderline cases, six of which also showed focal staining of the apical cytoplasm. All 22 cases of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma showed staining of the cell nucleus and entire cell cytoplasm. Focal staining of the apical cytoplasm in six of 17 borderline mucinous tumours produced a pattern of c-myc immunostaining similar to that of cystadenocarcinoma. Retrospective analysis of the clinical data showed that no significant differences between patients with borderline tumours of these two categories could be defined. Although immunostaining with Myc 1-6E10 can be used in the categorisation of mucinous ovarian tumours, it is concluded that standard histological criteria are more accurate indicators of tumour behaviour than is an assessment of c-myc expression.\r"

  ".W": "In situ hybridisation with acetyl-aminofluorene (AAF) and 35S-labelled DNA probes for polyomaviruses, was used to detect JC virus DNA in brain necropsy material in a patient with progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML). In a second patient PML was diagnosed from a brain necropsy specimen using the same technique. The main infected cell type were oligodendrocytes; dot hybridisation was used to estimate the number of viral copies in each infected cell. Southern blot hybridisation for further analysis of the viral genome was also carried out. In situ hybridisation with non-radioactive labelled polyomavirus DNA provides a simple and specific means for studying viral DNA in formaldehyde fixed tissue sections from patients with suspected PML. Even in small biopsy samples hybridisation results can be correlated with standard histopathological, immunocytochemical, and electron microscopic findings.\r"

A multivariate analysis (Cox) was used to test the prognostic importance of certain histological features (invasiveness, inflammatory reaction, and amount of fibrous tissue) at the tumour edge after allowance had been made for clinicopathological stage, tumour site, and histological type and grade. A poorly defined tumour border, lack of inflammatory reaction, and a pronounced fibrosis (desmoplasia) at the tumour edge were associated with unfavourable stage distributions, but each of these features also had an independent effect on prognosis.\r"

Electrophoresis of serum lipoproteins and of the lipoproteins and apolipoproteins in fractions isolated on density-gradient ultracentrifugation showed that the major portion of the serum cholesterol was being transported with lipoprotein-X. Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration was also raised. Lipoprotein-X contained, in addition to albumin and apolipoprotein C, apolipoprotein E. This case is of interest because of the degree of hypercholesterolaemia, its association with pseudohyponatraemia, and the unequivocal demonstration of apolipoprotein E associated with lipoprotein-X.\r"

Most measurements showed significant diurnal variations, but only for bilirubin, phosphate, and triglyceride did time of day account for more than 5% of the between subject variance. Serum bilirubin concentrations showed a pronounced downward trend in the afternoon, the mean value after 6 pm being 30% lower than the mean value in the morning. Mean serum triglyceride and phosphate concentrations increased steadily through the day. Mean concentrations of potassium, haemoglobin, and haematocrit and red cell count were higher in the morning, while urea and creatinine concentrations and white cell count had higher means in the afternoon. Glucose showed a pattern consistent with short term response to meals. The effects of these diurnal trends on routine use of biochemical tests needs careful consideration, and a greater understanding of their biological mechanisms is required.\r"

Keratocyst fluids contained significantly higher concentrations of lactoferrin than fluids from the other two types of cyst (p less than 0.001); but the range of values obtained within each group was large. Although lactoferrin represents a larger proportion of the total protein in keratocyst fluids than in dentigerous or radicular cyst fluids, lactoferrin concentration is not an absolute diagnostic marker for keratocysts. Lactoferrin concentration correlated strongly with the numbers of neutrophils present in keratocyst fluids (p less than 0.001), less so for dentigerous cyst fluids (p less than 0.05, and not at all in the case of radicular cyst fluids. It is suggested that neutrophils are the source of lactoferrin in the three categories of cyst studied but that the relatively impermeable nature of the keratocyst lining probably accounts for the particularly high concentrations of lactoferrin found in their fluids. Given that most keratocysts were asymptomatic, acute inflammation itself does not explain the reason for the high numbers of neutrophils in many of the fluids.\r"

Seven of them stained for MT1 and four for S100 protein but the traditional histological markers for myeloid cells--chloroacetate esterase and lysosyme--often stained only weakly and focally.

The latex agglutination test detected antibodies to primary T gondii infection much earlier in the infection than the ELISA, but the ELISA method was useful for detecting previous infection. It is concluded that the ELISA technique is more complex to perform than the latex agglutination test but the use of IgM and IgG assays combined could reduce the number of samples sent to the reference laboratory and thus reduce the time taken to obtain a final result.\r"

Thirty-seven patients, aged 4 to 29 years, were placed on a nonrestricted nutrition program for a study period of 4 years. Bandura's self-management principles were applied in counseling patients to meet their nutrition needs. The results showed significant increases in energy intake and body mass index values (p less than .001). The mean energy intake increased from 93.6 +/- 16.9% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance to 125.8 +/- 24.1% of the RDA, and mean body mass index value increased from 16.9 +/- 2.3 to 18.8 +/- 2.5. Pulmonary functions remained unchanged during the counseling period. Four to six counseling sessions were required before the mean caloric intake of the patients increased to the desired goal of 115% of the RDA. During the remainder of the study period, the mean caloric intake rose to 125% of the RDA. The results of this study suggest that cystic fibrosis patients are able to increase their caloric intake significantly with counseling.\r"

Joint pain and activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed by a physician. On the basis of the Four Food Group guidelines, dietary intakes were suboptimal in the dairy and grain groups, which are important sources of calcium, vitamin D, thiamin, iron, and riboflavin. Eighty percent of the sample were obese (BMI greater than or equal to 27). The average weight change since early adulthood was a gain of 59 lb.

The sample consisted of 54% women and 46% men and was predominantly white (88.9%). Fifty-four percent of the sample consumed some type of supplement; multiple vitamin/minerals were consumed with the greatest frequency. For single supplements, vitamin C was reported with the greatest frequency (23.1%), followed by some type of calcium supplement (22.5%) and vitamin E (11.1%). More than 80% of the vitamin C users indicated a dosage of 250 mg/day. Most respondents consumed calcium dosages of less than 1,000 mg/day. For vitamin E, 75% of the users consumed more than 200 IU/day. The data suggest that the potential for toxicity due to excess supplementation levels exists in the western states studied.\r"

Relatives of early-onset Alzheimer's disease patients may have an increased risk of lymphoreticular malignancies. This led us to evaluate the family history of central nervous system diseases in a case-control study of multiple myeloma. Thirteen of 439 multiple myeloma cases had one or more first-degree relatives with degenerative or demyelinating central nervous system disease. In comparison, there were nine \"positive\" family histories in 1,317 matched hospital controls (relative risk = 4.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.9-10.3). Relative risks for the component categories of Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and miscellaneous degenerative central nervous system diseases were 3.0, 4.0 and 11.9, respectively. Our findings suggest that the degenerative and demyelinating central nervous system diseases and the lymphoreticular malignancies may comprise an etiologically related group of \"protean diseases.\" These diseases may have a shared genetic susceptibility, possibly an immunologic abnormality. The varied disease manifestation in family members suggests a second necessary etiologic step of a variable and possibly environmental nature.\r"

During a 3-month period, all new admissions to the medical service of The Johns Hopkins Hospital were screened for alcoholism with two screening tests (the CAGE questionnaire and Short Michigan Alcohol Screening Test). The prevalence of screen-positive alcoholism was 27% in patients under 60 years of age and 21% in patients 60 years and older. Elderly patients with alcoholism were more likely to be black (P less than .01), but did not differ significantly in any other way from elderly patients who did not have alcoholism. Although 60% of screen-positive young patients with alcoholism were identified by their houseofficers, only 37% of elderly patients with screen-positive alcoholism were so identified (P less than .05). The elderly patients with alcoholism were significantly less likely to be diagnosed by their houseofficer if they were white, female, or had completed high school (P less than .01). Even when diagnosed, elderly patients with alcoholism were less likely than younger patients with alcoholism to have treatment recommended by their houseofficers (P less than .05) and, if treatment were recommended, it was less likely to be initiated (P less than .05). These data suggest that current medical education is deficient in providing physicians with the skills to detect and treat elderly patients with alcoholism.\r"

Statistical analysis was performed on patients over and under the age of 65, and on iatrogenic and noniatrogenic admissions. Twenty-three of 244 patients (9.4%) were admitted with drug-induced illness. Patients with drug-induced illness had 5.7 medications as compared to 3.2 medications per patient admitted for other reasons (P less than .05). A single drug was responsible for 61% of all drug-induced illness admissions. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were most often implicated. Eighteen of 155 elderly patients (11.7%) were admitted with drug-induced illness. These patients were on an average of 6.3 medications as compared with 3.8 medications per elderly patient admitted for other causes (P less than .005). Polypharmacy and a preponderantly elderly population may explain the substantial number of admissions caused by adverse drug reactions. Further research to assess the role of patient age and the number and type of medications involved in the event of drug-induced illness requires standardization of definition and diagnostic criteria.\r"

To describe the epidemiology of deaths from residential fires among older people, we analyzed mortality data for 1984 collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. Although older people represented only 12% of the U.S. population in 1984, they accounted for 29% (1,278) of that year's 4,466 residential fire deaths. Conflagrations accounted for 78% of older people's deaths from residential fires; clothing ignitions and other fires accounted for 11% each. Residential fire death rates increased with advancing age. Older black people had death rates 4.6 times the death rates of older white people. Older males had higher death rates than older females. Host, environmental, and behavioral risk factors for residential fire deaths among older people and potential strategies for intervention are discussed. Unless intervention strategies are focused on older people, the residential fire death toll in the U.S. may actually grow as the population of older people increases from 12% of the population in 1984 to about 21% of the population in 2030.\r"

Definitive treatment given for breast cancer (191 patients) and palliative therapy given for a variety of symptoms (784 patients) were investigated using data collected from 49 facilities selected on a random basis to reflect fairly the national practice of radiotherapy. Elderly (aged 70 or older) patients accounted for 28.6% of the palliatively treated patients and 19.5% of the definitively treated breast patients. No correlation was found between patient age and the dose or number of days used in palliative therapy. Older patients were more likely to have the \"boost\" dose of radiation to the tumor bed delivered through external rather than implant techniques. While statistically significant, this difference is not felt to be clinically important. We conclude that once a patient is selected for a course of radiation therapy, age per se, is not a basis for prejudicial treatment.\r"

  ".W": "This paper addresses the ways that noninstitutionalized older adults deal with involuntary urine loss. The data come from a 1983-1984 sample survey of Washtenaw County, Michigan residents aged 60 and over. Five hundred twelve self-reported incontinent respondents are included in the analyses. About a quarter of the incontinent respondents had discussed their condition with a doctor in the previous year, while 66% used one or more methods to control urine loss. Respondents preferred using absorbent products (47% of those who used some method) and locating a toilet upon reaching a destination (42%). Fewer respondents manipulated their voiding patterns (29%) or diet and fluid intake (17%), or did pelvic muscle exercises (10%). Only 7% were taking medication for their incontinence. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the choice of actions. Predictors were taken from theoretical models of health service utilization and health behavior, and included predisposing characteristics, health beliefs, enabling factors, and illness variables. Illness variables, particularly severity and type of incontinence, were the best predictors of consultation with a doctor and use of any urine control method. The predictors were less useful for understanding the choice of a specific method.\r"

The objective of this prospective longitudinal study was to examine the impact of exercise on cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, and strength in an elderly population that included chronically ill individuals. Patients were recruited initially from a population of veterans over 64 years of age who use a VA outpatient clinic as their regular source of care. The exercise intervention consisted of 90 minutes of exercise 3 days per week at 70% of the patient's maximal capacity. Activities included stationary cycling, stretching, weight training, and walking. Of 69 patients who began the program, 49 (71%) reached 4-month follow-up. Most patients completing follow-up (76%) had at least one chronic disease, such as arthritis, hypertension, or heart disease. Patients who dropped out were more likely to have multiple chronic illnesses than those who remained in the program. Average weekly attendance was 65% and was stable over time. Improvements in cardiovascular fitness at 4-month follow-up were significant: Metabolic equivalents increased from 7.1 +/- 2.3 to 8.3 +/- 2.6 (P less than .001), treadmill time increased from 8.5 +/- 3.8 to 11.2 +/- 4.2 minutes (P less than .001), submaximal heart rate decreased from 123.7 +/- 18.8 to 118.8 +/- 19.4 beats per minute (P less than .001) and resting heart rate decreased from 68.1 +/- 10.6 to 63.3 +/- 11.6 beats per minute (P = .005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The clinical features, the treatment given, the factors governing treatment selection, and the result of such treatment were analyzed in all patients aged 65 years and over in whom a tissue diagnosis of acute mesenteric infarction was made at a major teaching hospital. Thirty-two such patients, of mean age 78.5 years, were identified during the 8-year study period. Expected clinical features of bowel infarction were commonly absent; for example, there was no abdominal pain and no abdominal tenderness in 29% and 26% of patients, respectively. A sizeable minority of patients (29%) were acutely confused at presentation. All patients not undergoing surgery died shortly after admission to hospital. For those 20 patients (63%) who underwent abdominal surgery, half were discharged alive from hospital. Whether or not the patient survived was associated with the ward to which they were originally admitted. Those admitted to a surgical ward tended to be younger and had a more typical clinical presentation than their counterparts admitted to a medical ward. In particular they were more likely to have abdominal pain and distention and less likely to be confused. Surgical intervention was undertaken more often and earlier in those admitted to surgical wards and this may have accounted for the better outcome. It should be emphasized that acute mesenteric ischemia is a potentially correctable surgical condition even in very elderly people. A realization that the presentation is often atypical should increase the likelihood of early recognition and lead to improved patient survival.\r"

The rates of resting mass-independent oxygen consumption, the total cold-induced oxygen consumption expressed as body mass-independent (L.kg body mass-.67) or as lean body mass-independent (L.kg lean body mass-.67) did not differ among the four groups. Although the absolute (g) and the percentage of carcass mass as lean body tissue did not differ within the strains, these measures were significantly greater in the younger and older O-M rats compared to the F344 counterparts. In contrast, cold-exposed O-M rats showed significantly greater total specific GDP binding to isolated brown fat mitochondria than did the O-M animals (an index of brown fat thermogenic capacity); GDP binding did not differ between 12 and 24 months in either strain except when expressed in terms of body mass to the 0.67 power. In general, the results presented here showed no significant age-related loss in oxygen consumption in either strain. However, there did appear to be strain-related differences in brown fat mitochondrial GDP binding, and body composition.\r"

  ".W": "The mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ) appears to undergo a dynamic remodeling process with advancing age. Previous studies suggest that the NMJ becomes progressively larger with age, to a greater degree in fast-twitch muscles than slow-twitch muscles. To better understand this process, quantitative morphometry was conducted on soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) nerve terminals from C57BL/6NNia mice aged 4, 8, 10, 12, 18, 22, 24, and 32 months. Computer-aided morphometry of camera lucida drawings of aging nerve terminals indicated significant differences in the size and complexity of NMJs in both muscles between different age groups; however, there were no significant net trends with age. The magnitude and direction of the morphometric changes depended on the particular ages compared, and occurred to a greater degree in the EDL. This study is the first comprehensive morphometric study of C57BL/6NNia nerve terminals at so many ages. The results are similar to those obtained for the Fischer 344 rat, and support the hypothesis that nerve terminal remodeling is a dynamic process, not a progressive elaboration.\r"

Older patients with local disease who were undergoing lumpectomy were less likely to receive follow-up radiation; older patients with regional disease undergoing mastectomy were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (including hormonal therapy).

Gastric weight was 29% greater, but antral weight and DNA were less in the older rats. Serum gastrin fell during starvation and rose during refeeding in both groups, but it was lower in aging rats only during refeeding. Antral gastrin content in older animals was 60% of that in young rats. Starvation reduced antral gastrin only in the young, whereas refeeding lowered antral gastrin in the older animals. We conclude that, in aging rats, the relationship of serum and antral gastrin is altered during changes in food intake.\r"

Relationships among these several indices and systematic information on the effects of age, sex, and obesity have, however, not been systematically studied. Five anthropometric ratios that classify individuals into different body types have been computed for 1179 men and women aged 17-96 years. These are: waist hip ratio, arm thigh ratio, waist thigh ratio, waist arm ratio, and subscapular triceps skinfold ratio. In general, the age patterns show progressive trends toward increasing upper and central body fat deposition with age. In women there tends to be a postmenopausal acceleration of this trend. The ratios are distinctly higher in men than in women and are also independently influenced by the body mass index. Predictive equations that take age and BMI into account for each of the indices for men and women have been provided.\r"

They recorded their ages by decade. Average RT over the last eight (of ten) trials increased progressively from the 20s up to age 60 and over, and downward to the teens and under 10s. The single fastest RT in each test varied much less with age, only the 20s being clearly faster than the rest, with the under 10s slower. Within-subject variability of RT was increased only in the under 10s and over 60s. Ability to sustain attention during the longer PIs may underlie the gross average RT differences with age, and possibly some more basic neural property the superiority of the 20s in fastest RT.\r"

Sentence lists contained 50 key words preceded by a high predictability (HP), low predictability (LP), or a carrier phrase (CP) context accompanied by a varying background of multitalker babble. Comparison of the low context items vs the number of meaningfully rich items correctly identified provided an index of the listener's ability to use contextual information in the HP sentences. The LP and CP score reflected the individual's ability to recognize items based only on the acoustic-phonetic information of the key words. Most individuals were able to take some advantage of contextual cues in everyday sentences; however, the older listeners were more adversely affected by background noise than younger listeners. For clinical utilization of the SPIN test, further research is needed to develop normative data as a function of age to make it an \"age-fair\" test.\r"

This study examined the effects of age (young less than or equal to 60 years, old greater than 60 years) and sex on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), MMPI Scale 2 (Depression), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Responses to somatic versus psychological complaints on the BDI were examined separately, and the physical malfunctioning subscale (D3) of the MMPI-2 was also evaluated. No age effects were found on any of the depression scales' total scores. On the BDI, the older group reported more somatic complaints than the younger group. Psychological complaints were reported equally for young and old groups. Women reported more depressed items on the MMPI-2 and reported a greater number of symptoms of physical malfunctioning (D3) than men for both age groups. No age by sex interaction reached significance. A report of greater physical malfunctioning (D3) was significantly associated with higher scores on all the depression scales. The increased prevalence of somatic complaints on self-report depression scales probably results in higher scores, which are misinterpreted as representing more depression in the elderly population. It is recommended that a depression scale such as the GDS, which excludes somatic items, be used to assess depression in older adults.\r"

In this study, we incorporate the community context into an aggregate explanation of intermetropolitan variation in rates of living alone among elderly persons. We contend that three crucial community resources influence the rate of living alone: demographic and normative environment, economic affordability, and community social services. Data for Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States in 1980 provide initial support for this community-level explanation of elderly household composition.\r"

In contrast, this study investigates how personal care and home health services are used in relation to assistance from primary kin caregivers. A typology was developed based on task sharing or segregation between kin caregivers and service providers, and four types of informal-formal linkages around these tasks were identified: kin independence, formal service specialization, dual specialization, and supplementation. Findings regarding predictors of the types showed that caregiver and care recipient need variables were most significant in differentiating among them, although caregiver gender also had some discriminatory power.\r"

Scaling efforts must further address conceptual and operational specification, the differentiation of sources and dimensions of support, the objectification of self-report scales, and construct validity. Respondents to this survey are a community, stratified probability sample of adults aged 50 and older (N = 1,174). Measures employed include 2 items reflecting instrumental support and 17 items designed to tap Cobb's (1976) definition of expressive support as consisting of information that one is loved, esteemed, and embedded in a social relationship characterized by mutual caring and obligation. Factor analyses consistently discern one instrumental and three expressive dimensions of support: Caring and Concern, Social Integration, and Love and Affection. These subscales are differentially correlated with sociodemographic characteristics of the parents and adult children, as well as with depression and disability. Implications of these and other findings are discussed.\r"

The data were collected using a questionnaire that was distributed and returned by mail. The sample was taken from the subscription list of a newspaper in Florida that was a subsidiary of a large Canadian newspaper. The results show a population that was relatively young, married, in generally good health, and with rather extensive contacts with family and friends while residing in Florida. Nevertheless, more than a fifth indicated they were at least somewhat lonely. Results, using discriminate function analysis, showed that those more lonely were younger, female, less educated, not married, in poorer physical health, had fewer Florida friends, and had more children who lived near them in Canada, but fewer children who lived near them in the United States. Implications of the results are discussed.\r"

Noninvasive imaging modalities such as computed tomography, ultrasound, and technetium colloid liver scan are highly sensitive but nonspecific. Serum alkaline phosphatase is of similar value. A blind liver biopsy by the Menghini technique is often done to confirm the diagnosis, but its yield is low. We prospectively evaluated 74 patients using blind Menghini needle biopsy and concurrent Chiba fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) techniques. A positive diagnosis of malignancy was made in 30 patients (41%). In only 25 (34%) was the diagnosis made by Menghini biopsy, while Chiba FNAB confirmed the diagnosis in all 30 patients. Thus, concurrent use of both needles increased the diagnostic accuracy by 7%. Seven additional patients, considered to have one or more contraindications for the Menghini biopsy, underwent Chiba FNAB alone; the diagnosis was confirmed in all without complication. We conclude that FNAB alone or in combination with Menghini biopsy is valuable and safe in the diagnosis of metastatic liver disease.\r"

Whenever there were multiple polyps, all polyps were of the same histologic type. In no case did adenocarcinoma originate within a benign polyp.

  ".W": "Hypoxemia during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), or panendoscopy has been generally attributed to sedation. We studied 49 patients ranging in age from 17 to 71 years with normal or nearly normal lung function undergoing EGD to determine the effects of sedation and the effects of the endoscope on arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). All patients received intravenous diazepam and 41 also received meperidine. EGD was delayed 10.7 +/- 7.5 min after intravenous diazepam administration in the 42 group 1 patients. Seven patients underwent EGD within 2 min of receiving intravenous diazepam (group 2). Ventilation decreased after diazepam, recovered, then decreased immediately after endoscope insertion in the group 1 patients. Periods of hypopnea, up to 39 s long, were observed during EGD. The average decrease in SaO2 was 4.0% after diazepam (p less than 0.0001). SaO2 returned to the pre-EGD level, then decreased 2.4% during EGD (p less than 0.0005). Maximum SaO2 decrease occurred 27 +/- 6 s after insertion of the endoscope then rapidly recovered. There was a linear correlation between the duration of hypopnea and maximum SaO2 decrease (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001). All group 2 patients experienced a period of hypopnea (13.3 +/- 9.6 s) and SaO2 declined 9.0%. The SaO2 decline was significantly greater in the group 2 subjects (p less than 0.0001). Our results confirm previous findings that intravenous sedation causes hypoventilation and hypoxemia. Moreover, hypoventilation and further arterial oxygen desaturation are caused by either the mechanical effect of the endoscope or a reflex stimulated by it.\r"

Two cases of heterotopic gastric mucosa in the upper esophagus (HGM-UE) were demonstrated by TcO4-. In both, thyroid uptake was absent due to complete suppression of thyroid function by thyroid hormone supplements. TcO4- accumulated in thyroid glands of the other three patients, causing overlapping activity between the thyroid gland and HGM-UE. TcO4- scintigraphy is suitable for the detection of HGM-UE only in those patients who have had a total thyroidectomy or are on suppressive thyroid therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Some patients with hypergastrinemic achlorhydria may have false-positive secretin provocation as an exaggeration of the normal gastrin response to secretin, presumably related to an increased, or more responsive, antral G-cell mass. To test this hypothesis, we reviewed our experience with secretin provocation in normogastrinemic subjects with presumed normal antral G-cell mass (normal--17, duodenal ulcer--13) and in patients with hypergastrinemia related to changes in antral G-cells (vagotomy--5, hypochlorhydria--7, achlorhydria--10). Basal serum gastrin (mean +/- SEM) was progressively higher for each group; normal (42 +/- 3 pg/ml), duodenal ulcer (53 +/- 4 pg/ml), vagotomy (226 +/- 54 pg/ml), hypochlorhydria (346 +/- 92 pg/ml), achlorhydria (844 +/- 100 pg/ml). On selective analysis of only those with gastrin rises, significant differences (p less than 0.05) in peak gastrin change were found between achlorhydria (93 +/- 21 pg/ml) compared with all other groups and between hypochlorhydria (40 +/- 12 pg/ml) versus normal (6 +/- 1 pg/ml). Linear regression in these responders showed a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between basal gastrin and peak gastrin change after secretin. There were no false-positive secretin provocation tests, but four achlorhydric patients had gastrin rises greater than 100 pg/ml, whereas no patient in the other categories had rises above 90 pg/ml. Our results support the concept that patients with hypergastrinemic achlorhydria tend to have greater G-cell responsiveness to secretin provocation, which may account for the false-positive results in some such patients.\r"

We found (a) that patients with image-proven pancreatitis suffer a more severe clinical course than those without; (b) that the sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy in condition B are higher than in condition A at any cutoff level; (c) that none of the enzyme assays is specific at the upper reference limit, but their diagnostic yields are much improved by raising cutoff levels to about three or four times the upper limit; and (d) that at these selected cutoff levels, amylase had a diagnostic value similar to p-isoamylase or lipase in both conditions (sensitivity 84% and 92% for amylase in conditions A and B, respectively; specificity 98% and 98%; positive predictive value 75% and 90%; negative predictive value 99% and 99%; accuracy 91% and 97%). In conclusion, at an appropriately selected cutoff level, amylase can be effectively used as the first-line test and isoamylase or lipase as adjunct tests for acute abdominal conditions.\r"

I report a patient with portal hypertension in whom distortion of the inferior vena cava by cirrhosis and increased intraabdominal pressure initially suggested this condition. The correct diagnosis was made by obtaining lateral views during inferior vena cavography, which demonstrated a tapered, rather than membranous, obstruction, along with normal hepatic venous anatomy and pressure and markedly increased portal vein pressure during transhepatic puncture with a thin needle. That extrinsic deformity of the inferior vena cava may mimic membranous obstruction has not been emphasized recently. This distinction is important as surgical membranotomy is not indicated in patients with cirrhosis and secondary deformity of the inferior vena cava.\r"

Recent work has suggested possible viral involvement in these manifestations by demonstrating abnormal viral gp70 expression that segregates with the wasted mutation. In the experiments reported here, we examined tissue-specific expression of AKR viral (AKV) sequences and virus-like 30S (VL30) elements in wasted and control mice. Our studies showed that AKV and VL30 RNA expression were two- to fivefold higher in spleen, brain, and thymus of mice bearing the wst allele than in those of control mice. (These tissues have all been shown to display functional or developmental abnormalities in wst/wst mice.) Expression of viral mRNA in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes was similar in wasted and control animals. The majority of the VL30-hybridizing RNA in all tissues could be attributed to long-terminal-repeat rather than to main-body sequences. These differences in expression between wasted and control mice could not be attributed to differences in VL30 or AKV gene copy number. Our results demonstrate an association between altered expression of viral and virus-like sequences and the development of tissue-restricted abnormalities in wst/wst mice.\r"

  ".W": "Blood-borne lymphocytes initiate entry into secondary lymphoid organs, such as peripheral lymph nodes (PN) and gut-associated Peyer's patches (PP), by a highly specific adhesive interaction between the lymphocytes and the endothelium of specialized blood vessels known as a high endothelial venules (HEV). The selectivity with which functional subpopulations of lymphocytes migrate into particular lymphoid organs is believed to be regulated by the expression of cell adhesion receptors and complementary ligands on lymphocytes and HEV, respectively. The entry of lymphocytes into PN and PP has clearly been shown to involve distinct receptor-ligand pairs. Employing the Stamper-Woodruff in vitro adhesion assay, which measures lymphocyte attachment to HEV in cryostat-cut sections of lymphoid organs, we have previously shown that treatment of PN sections with two different sialidases inactivates HEV-adhesive ligands, whereas treatment of PP tissue sections has no effect on HEV-adhesive function. We now report that in vivo exposure of HEV to sialidase (after i.v. injection of the enzyme) also selectively prevents subsequent in vitro attachment of lymphocytes to PN HEV but not to PP HEV. Consistent with this organ-selective impairment of HEV-adhesive function by sialidase, i.v. injection of the enzyme is shown to prevent short term lymphocyte accumulation within peripheral lymph nodes while having no significant effect on accumulation in PP, blood, or nonlymphoid organs. Histologic examination with the sialic acid-specific lectin from Limax flavus verified that i.v. injected sialidase effectively removes stainable sialic acid moieties from HEV in both PN and PP. This study confirms that sialic acid is required for the adhesive function of PN HEV-ligands. A role for sialic acid as either a recognition determinant or as a regulatory molecule can be envisioned. In view of the fact that many pathogens release sialidase and cause substantially elevated serum levels of this enzyme, the present observations may have pathophysiologic significance. One mechanism by which such pathogens may avoid destruction is to inactivate susceptible HEV-ligands and disrupt the entry of lymphocytes into lymphoid organs where immune responses against the pathogens would normally be initiated.\r"

Among several chemotactic activity peaks eluted from a TSK-2000 gel filtration column, one peak, corresponding to a molecular mass of 17 kDa, accounted for about 40% of total chemotactic activity. On a chromatofocusing column, most of the 17-kDa activity eluted in a pH range of 9.4 to 7.9. It could bind to Orange-A Sepharose. These three characteristics--molecular mass, basic isoelectric point, and dye column binding--were similar to those of human glioma-derived monocyte chemotactic factor (GDCF), recently purified in our laboratory. Therefore, the MNL-derived chemoattractant was purified by the same procedures used for purification of GDCF, namely Orange-A Sepharose chromatography, carboxymethyl (CM)-HPLC, and reverse phase (RP) HPLC. About 50% of the culture fluid chemotactic activity bound to Orange-A Sepharose and was eluted in a single peak by a NaCl gradient. The active pool from the Orange-A column was separated into two sharp peaks by CM-HPLC, each of which eluted at identical acetonitrile concentrations from a RP HPLC column. By SDS-PAGE, the peptides had apparent molecular masses of 15 and 13 kDa and appeared homogeneous. Amino acid analysis showed that the composition of the two peptides was almost identical; and the N terminus of each peptide was apparently blocked. Shared characteristics of these peptides and the GDCF peptides include identical elution patterns from CM- and RP HPLC columns, identical SDS-PAGE migration, almost identical amino acid composition, and blocked N terminus. This suggests that the monocyte attractants isolated from culture fluid of PHA-stimulated MNL are identical to those derived from human glioma cells.\r"

  ".W": "Human monocytes, upon activation with opsonized zymosan, altered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) during a 24-h co-incubation, resulting in its oxidation and acquisition of cytotoxic activity against target fibroblast cell lines. Both the oxidation of LDL and its conversion to a cytotoxin were enhanced with time of incubation, with the most substantial changes occurring after 6 h of culture of LDL with activated monocytes. Unactivated monocytes did not mediate either alteration. Superoxide anion (O2-) participated in both the oxidation of LDL and its conversion to a cytotoxin since addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) at the beginning of the co-incubation inhibited, in a concentration dependent fashion, both the monocyte-mediated oxidation and the monocyte-mediated conversion of LDL to a cytotoxin. As expected, the rate of superoxide anion release was greatest during the respiratory burst, very early in the 24-h incubation (0 to 2 h); however, exposure of LDL to monocytes during the respiratory burst was not required for LDL oxidation. The lower levels of O2- released by the cells hours after the respiratory burst had subsided were sufficient to lead to the initiation of LDL oxidation. Three results indicated that the oxidative modification of LDL into a cytotoxin required O2(-)-independent free radical propagation after O2(-)-dependent initiation. First, oxidation of LDL exposed to the activated, superoxide anion-releasing monocytes for 6 h could be almost completely blocked by the addition at 6 h of the general free radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene, but not by SOD. Second, LDL oxidation proceeded even after removal of LDL from the superoxide anion-producing, activated cells after various durations of exposure. Third, the development of substantial levels of lipid peroxidation products and the development of greater cytotoxicity occurred after 6 h of exposure of LDL to activated cells, long after peak O2- release had subsided. These results lead us to conclude that monocyte-mediated oxidation of LDL, leading to its transformation into a cytotoxin, requires release of O2- occurring as a result of activation but not necessarily during the respiratory burst, and also requires O2(-)-independent free radical propagation. The modification of LDL into a potent toxin by activated monocytes may explain the tissue damage in atherosclerotic lesions and other pathologic sites in which inflammatory cells congregate.\r"

The index of vascular permeation used was the tissue to blood isotope ratio (tbir), which was obtained by dividing the ratio of 125I/51Cr counts in each tissue by the ratio of the same isotopes in the arterial blood sample. After Ag challenge, the increase in the tbir varied considerably among the different tissues. The most pronounced increase was noted in the lymph node (ninefold) followed by the aorta and mesentery (six- to sevenfold) and the various parts of the gastrointestinal tract (four- to sixfold). In the skin less than skeletal muscle less than lung less than liver and eye two- to fourfold increases occurred. Relatively minor increases in albumin permeation (less than twofold) were observed in the brain less than kidney less than heart and less than spleen. The testis was the only organ in which no significant change occurred. For some of the tissues there was also an increase in the tbir for 57Co/51Cr (an index of the extracellular fluid space) suggesting edema formation. The highest increase was noted in the aorta (fourfold). Minor increases occurred in the atrium of the heart, stomach, duodenum, and lymph nodes. There was also a 36% increase in hematocrit. Therefore, systemic anaphylaxis caused extensive extravasation of albumin and hemoconcentration.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has shown that platelet-derived adenine nucleotides modulate neutrophil superoxide anion (O2-) generation. Additional studies were undertaken to characterize the effects of authentic adenosine (ADO) and its nucleotide derivatives on the inflammatory functions of human neutrophils. Stimulus-specific inhibition of neutrophil O2- generation by ADO in response to FMLP was verified. In addition, the ability of ATP, ADP, and AMP to limit neutrophil O2- generation induced by FMLP (0.2 to 0.5 microM) was demonstrated. The concentration producing 50% inhibition for nucleotide inhibition of neutrophil O2- generation was in the rank order of ADO (0.1 microM) less than AMP (0.5 microM) less than ADP less than or equal to ATP (5 microM). Guanine and inosine nucleotides (0.01 to 100 microM) did not inhibit FMLP-stimulated neutrophil O2- generation. Neutrophil degranulation in response to FMLP was only modestly inhibited by adenine nucleotides and ADO. Adenosine and ADP failed to affect chemotaxis of neutrophils stimulated with FMLP. The inability of non-metabolizable analogs to mimic the inhibitory effects of authentic ATP or ADP on the neutrophil O2- response suggested that metabolism of added nucleotides is necessary for their effectiveness. Both TLC and HPLC confirmed that ATP and ADP were converted to AMP and ADO after their incubation with unstimulated or FMLP-activated neutrophils. The addition of adenosine deaminase to neutrophil reaction mixtures in which conversion of added nucleotides was apparent removed detectable ADO but failed to completely abrogate the inhibition of neutrophil O2- generation by accumulated AMP. The kinetics of inhibition of FMLP-induced neutrophil O2- generation by ATP and ADP also indicated that conversion of these nucleotides to ADO and/or AMP may be essential for their ability to reduce neutrophil responses.\r"

This study determined whether laminin acts in concert with chemoattractants to activate PMN. Laminin (5 to 100 micrograms/ml) stimulated lysozyme release and superoxide production in response to the chemoattractant, FMLP by as much as 69%. These results could be explained by changes in cell surface chemoattractant receptor expression in that incubation of normal PMN with laminin (5 to 75 micrograms/ml) increased the binding of 19 nM FML[3H]P by 35 to 80%. This corresponded to as much as a 2.5-fold increase in the number of chemoattractant receptors/cells which had a lower average affinity. Laminin did not change the number or affinity of FML[3H]P receptors present on organelle-depleted PMN cytoplasts, and the laminin-induced increase in FML[3H]P receptors expressed on PMN from a patient with a specific granule deficiency was only 11 to 21% of that seen in normal PMN. These findings suggest that chemoattractants augment the expression of laminin receptors which mediate PMN attachment to basement membranes, followed by laminin-induced increases in the expression of cryptic chemoattractant receptors contained in intracellular granules, with resultant augmentation of the oxidative burst.\r"

Clusters contained an average of 30 to 75 gold particles on cells from two donors which expressed 462 and 586 CR1 Ag sites/cell, as determined by flow cytometry. In thin section electron micrographs, gold complexes were seen surrounding an electron-dense material protruding from the membrane which represents compact aggregates of CR1. The maximal distance between gold particles and the membrane was 100 nm, which corresponds to the estimated length of the major allotypic form of CR1, as calculated from the primary DNA sequence of the molecule. The distribution in clusters of CR1 on the E membrane may provide the basis for an enhanced affinity of C3b-CR1 interactions on the plasma membrane of the cells and may explain the preferential binding of C3b-bearing immune complexes to E in vivo.\r"

This defect in the phagocyte inflammatory response caused by the C5 component of C deficiency was shown, by linkage analysis, to be the major reason for the extreme susceptibility of A/J mice to Lm infection. The importance of this genetic defect in C5 in relation to the poor macrophage inflammatory response and to the susceptibility to Lm infection was evaluated by developing a C5-sufficient congenic A/J mouse strain. This A/J.C5 mouse strain was studied for its inflammatory response and for its susceptibility to Lm infection. C5-sufficient congenic A/J.C5 mice showed a slight improvement (2X) in their level of macrophage inflammatory response; however, they did not mount an as strong response as the Listeria-resistant C57BL/6J mice which donated the C5 allele. When infected with Lm, A/J.C5 mice were found to be as resistant as C57BL/6J mice. These results suggest that the presence of C5 on an A/J background partially improves the deficient macrophage inflammatory response of that strain. This increase is sufficient to render the A/J.C5 mouse strain highly resistant to Listeria infection. A/J.C5 mouse strain represents a new tool for the study of the importance of C5 in resistance to infection and in the regulation of the macrophage inflammatory response.\r"

Processing of the gamma 2b mRNA did not change with the amount of message produced, demonstrating that the production of predominantly secretory mRNA in plasma cells is not the consequence of increased message synthesis. The length of the intron between the secretory and membrane exons was found to affect the relative expression of secretory and membrane mRNA, but this effect was also observed in non-lymphoid cells, suggesting that the intron \"gradient effect\" does not identify the processing reaction which is regulated during B cell differentiation. Deletion of the signals for the splice from CH3 to the membrane exons resulted in the exclusive production of secretory mRNA irrespective of the developmental stage of the recipient cell, suggesting that this splice reaction plays a role in regulating these mRNA, and that competition between the two polyadenylation sites does not dictate the relative expression of the two forms of message. Appropriate ratios of the two forms were produced from a 2.3-kbp fragment of the gamma 2b gene containing the secretory cleavage and membrane splice signals in the context of a different transcription unit. These results suggest that the changes in the relative expression of secretory and membrane gamma 2b mRNA during B cell development are mediated by a competition between cleavage at the secretory polyadenylation and splicing from CH3 to the membrane exons.\r"

One cosmid cluster, encompassing 41.4 kb of DNA, contained four, or possibly five, class I genes that mapped to the RT1.E-grc region Two unique non-class I fragments were isolated from certain cosmids within this cluster. These fragments were hybridized to genomic DNA derived from five rat strains (BIL/2, R18, R21, R22, and BIL/1), and the results showed that grc-bearing rats have a deletion of at least 3.1 kb of DNA in the region immediately adjacent to the MHC. The loss of the genes in this region is probably the cause of the growth and reproductive defects in these animals and probably also of their increased susceptibility to chemical carcinogens.\r"

The morphological changes of the ED and ES under these circumstances have been compared with those induced by ethacrynic acid intoxication. Although the cochlear partition did not show signs of damage, the ED and ES system seems to be negatively influenced by the dehydrative state and displays a marked imbibition of the subepithelial tissue, which at places shows accumulation of an organic matrix. A regulating role for the antidiuretic hormone on the inner ear fluids of the mongolian gerbil is also proposed and discussed.\r"

All patients were followed up for a period of 1-2 years. Patients with hearing loss due to factors such as previous ear surgery, family history, exposure to noise etc., have been excluded. The conclusions reached were that there is a relationship between the period of disease and the sensorineural hearing loss and that the local treatment with a mixture containing neomycin + polymyxin B appears to contribute to the worsening of the sensorineural hearing loss in patients with chronic otitis media. Our numbers are small and further studies must be done, but the fact that currently used ear drops may produce a sensorineural hearing loss should not be ignored.\r"

A pilot study to assess the prognostic value of electroneuronography (ENOG) in 14 patients following acoustic neuroma removal was performed. The results suggest that post operative ENOG is of value in dividing those patients with anatomically intact facial nerves yet complete clinical paralysis post-operatively into groups: one with rapid improvement to an acceptable functional and cosmetic result and one with prolonged paralysis with incomplete or no recovery. Electroneuronography may thus be used to predict the initial recovery profile in patients with complete facial paralysis after surgery.\r"

The head was linked to the base by a crural plate, probably formed by the fusion of the material of the two crura. Microscopy showed a slightly less interwoven structure of the fibrillar bone present mainly at the cranial aspect of the crural plate. Honeycomb-like bone was confined to the caudal part of the crural plate. Microscopy revealed a cavity in the centre of the stapes at the transition between the base and the plate. During surgery, a bony structure was found linking the posterior side of the head of the stapes to the pyramidal eminence. Post-operative audiograms revealed improved hearing with some residual conductive loss of about 10 dB. This case illustrates that a columellaform stapes may occur without forming part of a syndrome.\r"

The localization of these effusions, demonstrates the segmental anatomy of the middle ear.\r"

The meningioma was found to be wholly contained within the left mastoid antrium. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a meningioma localised to the mastoid antrium. The patient had been assessed in the ENT department on two separate occasions, 17 years and 19 years previously for nebulous symptoms related to the left ear which had cleared spontaneously. Following a second episode of pyogenic meningitis, both of which were associated with aural symptoms, radiological examination suggested an intramastoid pathology which prompted mastoid exploration. Histological examination of the mass confined to the mastoid antum provided the diagnosis of meningioma. There was no clinical or radiological evidence of extratemporal spread of tumour.\r"

Measurements were performed according to criteria recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography. Absolute values for all parameters except for left ventricular (LV) shortening fraction (SF) were greater in men (P less than 0.001). When corrected for body surface area (BSA), the differences between the two genders were far less pronounced. Women had greater left atrium (LA) (P less than 0.01) and LV end-diastolic diameter (EDD) (P less than 0.001), whereas the interventricular septum in end-diastole (IVS-ED) (P less than 0.05) and LV posterior wall (PW) in ED (P less than 0.001) were thicker in men. Only weak correlations between age and the various echocardiographic parameters with r-values less than or equal to 0.30 were observed. It is recommended that BSA corrected values should be preferred since the differences between men and women are negligible. When absolute values are used, different normal ranges for both sexes should be applied.\r"

Ventricular tachycardia was defined as four or more consecutive ventricular beats with a rate above 120 per min. During an 18-month period. VT was observed in 102 individuals (13%) out of 800 patients without acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The 102 patients were compared with age- and sex-matched patients with AMI and VT and a group with AMI but without VT. Hospital mortality was 27% in patients with AMI and VT, 23% in patients with AMI without VT, and 16% in non-AMI patients with VT (NS). First year mortality after discharge was 20% in the non-AMI group compared to 12% in the AMI groups (NS). The 1-6 years survival curves also did not differ significantly between the groups with a yearly mortality of between 5 and 6%. Acute myocardial infarction patients with rapid VT (greater than 150 min-1) or long VT (more than 10 beats) had a higher hospital mortality, otherwise the number or type of VT episodes did not relate to short- or long-term prognosis in the studied groups. Ventricular tachycardia in the CCU did not seem to be an indicator of poor long-term prognosis. It is concluded that long-term prognosis in patients with VT in the CCU was little influenced by a current diagnosis of AMI.\r"

Out of approximately 4000 patients undergoing coronary angiography, four men and one woman, 37 to 60 years old, showed total occlusion of this vessel. Four of them had angina pectoris and three had had a myocardial infarction. All five showed deep ST depression in V 2(or 3)-6 during bicycle exercise testing. Apart from the left main artery occlusion, all had significant obstructive lesions in other coronary vessels, including the right coronary artery or its major branches. There was collateral circulation from the right coronary artery in all patients. Left ventricular function was well preserved in three patients and markedly impaired in two. Four patients underwent bypass surgery and they have been followed for 10 to 28 months. Three are free of angina and one has only minimal angina. One patient refused surgery and he continued to have severe angina despite intense medical treatment. He died suddenly after 30 months follow-up. In patients with complete occlusion of the left main coronary artery, development of adequate collateral flow seems important in preserving left ventricular function, but collaterals are usually insufficient to prevent angina. Moreover, associated obstructive lesions in other coronary arteries constitute a potential threat to the collateral circulation. Effective symptomatic relief is obtained by coronary bypass grafting, and revascularization may also improve prognosis in this subset of patients with coronary heart disease.\r"

Twenty-four patients (17%) were discharged home, all but one without mental impairment. Seventy-three patients presented with ventricular fibrillation, 21 (29%) of which were discharged. The mean ambulance response time was 5 min. Bystanders initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in 40 cases (29%) which significantly improved the outcome. In witnessed arrests, 19 of 36 patients (53%) with bystander-initiated CPR were discharged compared to 5 of 62 patients (8%) where CPR awaited the arrival of the ambulance team. These results are comparable to those obtained in larger metropolitan areas. In small urban areas the size of Reykjavik (population of 110,000), an advanced and efficient prehospital care can be organized as an extension of the emergency departments role.\r"

All except two of the hypertensive patients were on a beta-blocker based antihypertensive treatment regime. The relative heart volume on X-ray was significantly larger in the hypertensives, 562 ml m-2 body surface area (BSA), compared to the normotensives, 408 ml m-2 BSA (P less than 0.001). Both left ventricular diameter (LVD) in end-diastole and end-systole and left arterial (LA) diameter were significantly larger in the hypertensives (56 vs. 51 mm, P less than 0.01; 35 vs. 31 mm, P less than 0.01; 46 vs. 42 mm, P less than 0.01, respectively) as was the LV mass (296 vs. 203 g, P less than 0.001). The end-systolic wall stress (ESWS) was significantly greater in the hypertensives. Despite these findings resting left ventricular fractional shortening was the same and showed a similar correlation with ESWS (r = 0.79 and r = 0.77, respectively) in both groups. Hence, left ventricular systolic performance was not impaired in the hypertensives compared to the normotensives. These results show that an enlarged cardiac silhouette on the chest X-ray in hypertensive subjects with beta-blocker based drug therapy must be interpreted with caution and must not, a priori, be judged as a sign of an impaired systolic cardiac function.\r"

Peripheral insulin resistance, as well as decreased enzymatic activity in the skeletal muscle, has been suggested in type II diabetes. Potassium is essential for such enzymatic reactions. In this study, obese men, but not women, with glucose intolerance tended to have a lower total body potassium per kg body weight, indicating a smaller muscle mass, than weight-matched normoglycaemic men. They also had a lower skeletal muscle potassium content per 100 g dry weight (P less than 0.05) and a higher muscle Na/K-ratio (P less than 0.05) compared with obese men with normal glucose tolerance. Muscle fat and muscle sodium content were higher in obese men than in women with the same body mass index (P less than 0.01). The muscle electrolyte changes can be explained by a decrease in the insulin mediated Na/k-pump activity across the cell membrane or a smaller number of insulin receptors on the skeletal muscle cell in patients with glucose intolerance.\r"

Except for minimal changes in the peroneal nerve, no statistically significant alteration in number of MF/nerve or in the fascicular area was associated with aging. The unaltered number was misleading since striking changes in MF size distribution, pathologic alterations of fibers and the presence of regeneration clusters suggested age-related degenerative and regenerative events. These changes were most dramatic in the ventral root, where myelin infolding, myelin separation from axon and ballooning, macrophagia and hyperplasia of Schwann cell nuclei were pronounced. Concomitant with these alterations, axonal atrophy (a reduction in caliber of axons relative to myelin spiral length or number of myelin lamellae) was demonstrated in MF of the ventral root in old age.\r"

The invading phagocytic cell population was identified as Fc receptor-positive, Mac-1-positive macrophages by immunocytochemistry. The Schwann cell population persisted without significant myelin phagocytosis. The vitality of the Schwann cell population was shown by subsequent reimplantation of the organ cultures into host animals. The reimplants had retained their ability to remyelinate regenerating axon sprouts. These observations were made in cultures exposed to cytostatic agents. If cytostatic agents were omitted, there was proliferation of endogenous phagocytes in the nerve fascicles without added peritoneal cells. These endogenous phagocytes were identified as proliferating resident monocytes and were positive for the Fc receptor and Mac-1 markers. This model allows studies on how monocytes recognize and digest degenerating myelin apart from surviving Schwann cells.\r"

Amino acid sequences have not revealed similarities with other proteins except cartilage extracellular matrix proteins, the region of similarity being located within the hyaluronate-binding region. Cryostat sections of 13 intracranial neoplasms removed at surgery were tested for the presence of GHA protein by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies. These included seven astrocytomas, one oligodendroglioma, one medulloblastoma and one spinal cord ependymoma. All tumors were negative with the exception of one astrocytoma in which the GHA protein-positive areas had the typical appearance of polar spongioblastoma, i.e. small cells palisading around blood vessels and very delicate glial fibrillary acidic (GFA) protein-positive fibrils. Conversely, neoplastic as well as reactive GFA protein-positive astrocytes were GHA protein-negative. We suggest that polar spongioblastoma derives from a GHA protein-positive glial precursor and pertinent to this suggestion is the observation that the periventricular germinal layer was found GHA protein-positive in a 22-week human fetus.\r"

Immune modulating functions have been proposed for both microglia and astrocytes in several pathological states. Using immunocytochemistry, we have found that large numbers of neuroglial cells contain immunoglobulin G (IgG) in normal mice of the C57 BL/6 strain. Most IgG-positive cells had both the morphology and distribution of microglia, including a higher density in grey matter, and were frequently found in perivascular or perineuronal locations. The accumulation of IgG does not appear to be by nonselective phagocytosis of extracellular fluid, since serum albumin could not be detected within microglia. There was little overlap in the distribution of cellular processes positive for IgG and those which showed astrocytic markers. Neuronal accumulation of plasma proteins was also seen in a distribution described by previous investigators. The function of this selective accumulation of IgG by normal microglia is unknown, but may reflect a role in the immune response within the central nervous system.\r"

The authors did, however, find cost savings (approximately $450) for those co-op patients cared for by physicians who were frequent users of the unit. Most of the savings for this group was achieved through a reduction in the cost of routine services, which includes nursing care. If the current nursing shortage leads to an increase in co-op units, nursing administrators need to be aware that potential cost savings may depend on physician familiarity with the co-op concept. A major role of nursing therefore, is to provide information on the benefits of cooperative care both to physicians and to potential patients.\r"

Diets containing 20% fat (wt/wt), primarily in the form of coconut oil, beef tallow, or soybean oil were fed to weanling rats for 28 d. All diets were adequate in essential fatty acids. Feeding the coconut oil diet, containing more than 50% saturated medium-chain fatty acids, increased the long-chain omega 3 fatty acid levels and altered the ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids in membrane phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine compared to that in animals fed diets containing a saturated tallow or polyunsaturated soybean oil diet. Change in membrane fatty acid composition in response to the coconut oil diet was accompanied by decreased synthesis of phosphatidylcholine via the cytidine diphosphate choline (CDP-choline) pathway, and increased synthesis via the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway. An overall decrease in phosphatidylcholine production was reflected in a lower ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine in the membrane. Modulation of hepatic phosphatidylcholine synthesis during early growth thus appears to be in response to the ratio of long-chain omega 6 fatty acids to omega 3 fatty acids in membrane phospholipid rather than levels of specific fatty acids or the relative degree of saturation of fatty acids in the diet.\r"

Six-wk-old male mice were fed either a diet corresponding to the U.S. average gross composition (US74, 40% of total energy as fat, 347 mg cholesterol/1000 Kcal, P/S = 0.24) or a modified-fat diet (30% of total energy as fat, 46 mg cholesterol/1000 Kcal, P/S = 0.91). After 8 wk of feeding, neither strain had developed hypercholesterolemia. CBA/J mice had higher concentrations of serum total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and a higher esterified-to-free cholesterol ratio than did C57BR/cdJ mice. CBA/J mice maintained a constant serum cholesterol concentration mainly by adjusting the hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) activity, whereas C57BR/cdJ mice did so by changing the fecal excretion of cholesterol. Compared to the modified-fat diet, the US74 diet caused an increase in the ratio of total to HDL serum cholesterol, liver microsomal free cholesterol, fecal cholesterol and hepatic microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and a decrease in hepatic microsomal HMGR activity. We conclude that the metabolic responses to small differences in dietary fat are different in CBA/J and C57BR/cdJ mice.\r"

Triacylglycerols (TG) in whole plasma and VLDL + LDL were lower in rats fed high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than in those fed the CO diet. Plasma HDL2 components in FBO and CLO groups were generally lower than in the other groups. Percentages of liver and heart linoleic and arachidonic acid were higher in the SO group, but lower in groups fed marine oils, than in the CO group. There was a high relative amount of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid in liver and heart of rats fed marine oils. Fecal excretion of bile acids was lower in the PUFA groups than in the CO group, whereas the sum of neutral sterols was similar in all groups. Plasma HDL2 (and VLDL + LDL) correlated positively, but HDL3 negatively, with fecal bile acid excretion. Accordingly, increased bile acid excretion does not seem to account for hypolipemia following intake of PUFA diets.\r"

As in previous studies, offspring of rats fed cholestyramine during pregnancy had a plasma total cholesterol level similar to controls when fed a low fat and cholesterol diet, but higher than controls when fed a 20% (wt/wt) fat plus 5% (wt/wt) cholesterol diet. Analyses of the plasma cholesterol density distribution by continuous gradient ultracentrifugation showed that, compared to control rats, rats born to dams fed cholestyramine had more cholesterol in the higher density regions of plasma before and after a 7-d high fat and cholesterol diet challenge. After a 4- or 7-d diet challenge, rats fed cholestyramine had 2-3 times more cholesterol in the d less than or equal to 1.006 g/ml range of plasma compared to the control offspring. The results suggest that long term changes in cholesterol metabolism due to early nutrition in the rat may include altered plasma or intestinal lipoprotein metabolism, rather than an effect specific to hepatic cholesterol synthesis.\r"

Pectin, guaran, methylcellulose, and carrageenan were added (20% wt/wt) to a fiber-free control diet and were fed for 4 wk prior to the experiment. Excretion of 3H-PEG 900 and 14C-PEG 4000 was measured over a period of 96 h after administration of the markers in the drinking water. In general, the ratio of PEG 4000 to PEG 900 in the urine increased after fiber feeding: from 0.20 in the controls to 0.31, 0.37, 0.29, or 0.27 (medians) in the pectin-, guaran-, methylcellulose-, or carrageenan-fed group, respectively. The pattern of excretion of the two PEG markers in rats fed the fiber-free diet differed from that in the polysaccharide-fed rats. Pectin and guaran, two polysaccharides readily fermented by intestinal bacteria, led to a higher excretion of PEG 4000 but an unaltered excretion of PEG 900, whereas methylcellulose and carrageenan, two polysaccharides more inert against microbial degradation, were associated with a lower excretion of PEG 900 with unchanged excretion of PEG 4000. The study shows that polysaccharides, which may be representative of the soluble portion of dietary fiber, can influence the intestinal permeability of larger molecules. The microbiologically degradable polysaccharides in particular may lead to an increased absorption of larger molecules.\r"

Studies were conducted to determine if dietary fiber would reduce exposure of the intestine to dietary benzo(a)pyrene (BP) as indicated by intestinal BPH activity. In all studies, female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a fiber-free purified diet for 7 d, whereupon they were switched to experimental diets for 48 h. After 48 h their small intestinal mucosa was assayed for BPH activity. Diets for the initial study contained 0, 100, 400, 800, or 1200 mg BP/kg diet, each with and without 10% soft white wheat bran. Enzyme induction with 100 and 400 mg BP/kg diet was partially inhibited by bran, but with higher concentrations of BP there was no protective effect. The inhibition in BP-induced intestinal BPH activity was observed with 10% wheat bran but not with 3.3 or 6.6%. Subsequent studies showed no significant inhibition in BPH induction with cellulose or lignin, whereas all forms of wheat bran (hard red, soft white, or finely ground soft white) caused significant inhibition. In the final study, a diet containing charcoal-broiled beef, a known source of PAH, was compared with diets containing raw beef or soybean protein, each with and without 10% soft white wheat bran. BPH activity remained low with raw beef and soybean protein whether or not fiber was added. However, intestinal BPH activity was raised ninefold by charcoal-broiled beef. The addition of bran reduced BPH activity to 65% of that observed with the fiber-free, charcoal-broiled beef diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Male Wistar rats were adapted for 1 wk to a purified diet and then divided into three groups and given 30 min to consume a test meal. The test meal contained 5% fiber derived from guar gum (GG) or wheat bran (WB) or was fiber-free (FF), and each contained 2.5 microCi 14C-labeled starch. At 1, 2.5, or 5 h postprandial, a group from each dietary treatment was killed, and stomach, small and large intestine and cecum were removed to determine the distribution of radioactivity. The isotope emptied from the stomach at a similar rate for all three groups. The percent ingested dose in the small intestine (SI) was highest in the upper half at 1 h and highest in the lower half at 2.5 h for all groups. The percent ingested dose of 14C-starch was significantly higher from upper SI segments in the GG group than from those in the FF group at 2.5 and 5 h, whereas percent ingested dose did not differ in the upper SI segments in the WB group compared to the FF group at 1, 2.5 and 5 h. These data indicate that a viscous polysaccharide (GG) can delay the disappearance of starch from the SI whereas a source of insoluble fiber (WB) did not slow starch disappearance.\r"

Neurological evaluation included neurophysiological examination of the sural nerve and tibial nerve, neurophysiological examinations, and CT-scanning of the brain. Alcohol and vitamin intakes were quantified by the interview method. Vitamin B-12 and folate status included examinations of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate, plasma vitamin B-12, plasma and erythrocyte folate, formiminoglutamic acid excretion test (FiGlu), methylmalonic acid excretion, and deoxyuridine suppression test (dU) on phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral lymphocytes. The liver function was assessed by galactose elimination capacity and plasma clearance of antipyrine. There was no hematological sign of folate or vitamin B-12 deficiency. About 8% had low plasma folate, while neither erythrocyte folate nor plasma vitamin B-12 were decreased. However, half of the patients had functional folate deficiency as determined by abnormal FiGlu or dU. Compared to the remaining patients, those with abnormal FiGlu or dU had significantly more abnormal neurophysiological tests, and lower folate intake. There was no correlation between FiGlu or dU and the quantitative liver function tests. It is concluded that 1) folate deficiency may contribute to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy, 2) the classical parameters for folate deficiency (blood concentrations, peripheral blood, and bone marrow examinations) are not reliable in diagnosing folate deficiency and 3) functional tests like FiGlu and dU are necessary to diagnose folate deficiency in alcoholics.\r"

Mean body temperature was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) after 1 h in animals receiving either the 10 or 50 mg dosage (+ 0.27 +/- 0.05 and + 0.41 +/- 0.07 degree C, respectively) compared to that in animals receiving the 2 mg dosage (-0.07 +/- 0.05 degree C), the recommended daily intake for guinea pigs. Changes in body temperature of animals receiving the 50 mg dosage plus indomethacin did not differ significantly from those reported with the 2 mg dosage. Thus, a single oral dose of ascorbic acid at levels 5-25 times the recommended intake, can elevate body temperature significantly in healthy guinea pigs, a phenomenon which is inhibited by indomethacin administration.\r"

Four consecutive balance studies of 4 d each were performed in lactating rats and nonlactating controls. Lactating rats had dramatically higher intestinal absorptions of Ca and P resulting from both increased food consumption and elevated fractional absorptions of these elements. Urinary Ca excretion was reduced during lactation whereas urinary P excretion was unchanged. Endogenous fecal Ca excretion (determined by infusing 45Ca and dividing fecal 45Ca content by urinary 45Ca specific activity) was similar in lactating and nonlactating rats. In a separate study, pup retention of ingested Ca averaged 96%. Therefore, the difference in pup carcass Ca content between d 1 and 17 of age is assumed to equal 96% of the Ca transfer rate into milk. Similar calculations were applied to P. Milk transfer rates were determined to be 126 and 99 mg/d for Ca and P, respectively. These calculations indicate that 19% of the Ca transferred to milk was derived from the maternal skeleton with the maternal diet supplying the remaining Ca. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the alterations in Ca and P fluxes that occur during lactation in the rat.\r"

Iron deficiency also increased MT-I concentrations in the bone marrow but concentrations in the liver were unchanged and those in the kidneys were reduced. The MT-I in the blood cells was associated mainly with the lighter cell fractions which were rich in reticulocytes. It is suggested that concentrations of MT-I in blood cells reflect erythropoietic activity.\r"

Anemic rats were fed diets containing soy protein concentrate or rice bran as the source of nonheme iron with either lactalbumin or distilled water-washed beef, which was heme free. The criteria used to determine the relative biological value (RBV) of iron was the difference between the products of final hemoglobin x final weight and initial hemoglobin x initial weight during the repletion period. Animals fed diets with only lactalbumin as a source of dietary protein and graded levels of FeSO4 (RBV of FeSO4 = 100%) served as controls. The RBV of the endogenous iron in soy protein and rice bran was found to be 91 and 46%, respectively. Substituting washed beef for lactalbumin increased the RBV of soy protein iron to 96% (results not statistically significant) and of rice bran iron to 75% (results significant, P less than or equal to 0.05). These findings demonstrate the \"meat factor\" effect in the rat for the first time. Two days after completion of the 11-d hemoglobin regeneration period, the apparent absorption of iron was measured during a 60-h balance period. The apparent absorption of iron by rats fed diets containing beef tended to be higher, compared to animals fed diets containing lactalbumin.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 94) were fed from weaning diets that contained 0.65-0.85 mg copper/kg diet for 42 d. The experimental design of the study was a 2 x 2 x 3 analysis of variance: two types of carbohydrate (fructose, corn starch), two modes of copper delivery (orally or subcutaneously) and three different extrinsic copper levels (0, 1.5 or 3 mg/kg diet or 0, 11.25 or 22.5 micrograms Cu/d by injection). In the rats fed fructose, direct indicators of copper status such as plasma copper and tissue superoxide dismutase activity were increased to a much greater extent when copper was supplied subcutaneously rather than orally as part of the diet. In the starch-fed rats the effect of the mode of copper delivery on the levels of these indices was usually not significantly different. As a result, the feeding of fructose as compared to starch produced lower levels of direct indicators of copper status when copper was supplied in the diet but not subcutaneously. It appears that ingestion of fructose as compared to starch increases the requirement for copper and that the mode of copper administration that circumvents the gastrointestinal tract attenuates the fructose-copper interaction. Thus, the fructose-copper interaction occurs either during intestinal digestion and absorption, hepatic uptake of copper via the portal blood or its hepatic utilization.\r"

This study examined PGE2 synthesis by presumptive and mature adipocytes isolated from lean and obese Zucker rats. Isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was greater in short-term incubations of mature adipocytes isolated from lean rats than in those from obese rats in terms of both sensitivity (lean 10(-7) M vs. obese 10(-6) M) and magnitude of response (five-fold greater in lean at 10(-6) M). Prostaglandin E2 synthesis was dose-dependent in isoproterenol-stimulated adipocytes from lean rats, while PGE2 synthesis in adipocytes from obese rats was not altered, regardless of treatment. Primary cell cultures of presumptive adipocytes from both phenotypes released PGE2 in response to lipolytic compounds, however, cultures from obese rats had lower PGE2 release rates than cultures from lean rats. In addition, compared to cultures derived from lean rats, a greater degree of adipocyte differentiation in cultures from obese rats was associated with lower basal PGE2 synthesis. These results suggest that an impairment in the ability of adipocytes isolated from obese Zucker rats to enzymatically synthesize PGE2 accompanies maturation.\r"

Protein fractional synthesis rate was 184%/d at 1 wk of age and 153%/d in 5-wk-old animals (P greater than 0.05). This lack of developmental change resulted from constant (P greater than 0.05) ribosomal capacities (total RNA/protein ratios) and efficiencies of protein synthesis (synthetic rates relative to RNA). No further alteration for protein fractional synthesis rate (144%/d) occurred in 8-wk-old suckling animals (P greater than 0.05). In contrast, 8-wk-old ruminants exhibited higher protein fractional synthesis rate (244%/d) than 8-wk-old suckling animals, although ribosomal capacity was markedly higher in both 8-wk-old groups than in youngest animals (P less than 0.05). The present findings clearly indicate that in vivo protein synthesis in the developing ovine pancreas depends primarily on age. Potentialities for increased rates of pancreatic protein synthesis, i.e., increases in total RNA content and ribosomal capacity appear between 5 and 8 wk of age in this species. At 8 wk of age, however, when lambs are generally weaned, solid food ingestion resulted in a rise for both fractional and absolute rates of protein synthesis, essentially because ruminants maintained a higher efficiency of protein synthesis than milk-fed animals (P less than 0.005). Finally, there was a relationship between pancreatic protein synthesis and protein intake in only ruminant lambs.\r"

In this study, the activity, total quantity and the subcellular distribution of acetyl CoA carboxylase were determined in liver of fed and fasted (48 h) homozygous obese (fa/fa) zucker rats and homozygous lean (Fa/Fa) littermates. The results indicate that neither diet nor genetic obesity affected the total quantity of acetyl CoA carboxylase per unit weight of liver. Instead, increased activity of this enzyme in the liver of the Zucker rat was primarily due to a shift in the subcellular distribution away from relatively inactive mitochondrial forms toward active cytosolic forms. Thus, the Zucker rat appears to be yet another example illustrating the physiological importance of regulating the activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase by controlling its subcellular distribution.\r"

The thyroids were examined for gross and microscopic changes and sera were assayed for antibodies to triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyroglobulin (Tg). The body weights and food consumption of the rats fed 0.2 mg of iodine/kg were significantly lower than those of the animals fed higher amounts. Urinary iodine excretion reflected dietary intakes. The thyroids from animals fed 2.0 and 3.0 mg/kg were significantly (P less than 0.01) larger than those from animals fed 0.2 mg/kg. One rat fed 0.2 mg/kg and 2 rats in each group fed 2.0 and 3.0 mg/kg had extensive lymphocytic thyroiditis. Three rats fed 1.0 mg/kg, 6 fed 2.0 mg/kg and 6 fed 3.0 mg/kg had enlarged thyroids. Two rats fed 0.2 mg/kg, 2 fed 2.0 mg/kg and 6 fed 3.0 mg/kg had detectable Tg antibodies. These data suggest that high iodine intakes increase Tg antibodies, which may be associated with an increase in autoimmune thyroiditis in these animals.\r"

Neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions in the liver, skin, and pancreas were also present to a similar extent with BC feeding and without BC. Colorectal cancer was induced by six 2 mg intrarectal infusions of MNNG per rat over a 3-wk period, with the rats held another 22 wk without an inhibitory effect by BC. Thus, 0.2% dietary BC failed to influence significantly the development of neoplasia induced by a direct-acting carcinogen in the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

There was also no significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative incidence of TM pain or clicking. No correlation was found between the magnitude of advancement and the percent change in ICA or ICW, and the mandibular shape did not correlate to changes in ICW.

The nerve demonstrated a regenerative capacity over a 1-cm defect, with morphology and function that approximated normals, but could not span a 2-cm gap defect unaided. Crush injuries produced findings that were inferior to both those in normal nerves and in those with resections. In 1-cm defects, both grafting and tubular repairs produced similar results, with substantial recovery of neural function after 16 weeks. In 2-cm defects, autogenous grafting was superior to tubulization by both morphologic and functional assessment. Replacement of the lateral cortex of the mandible after nerve repair was shown to be unnecessary. The implications of these findings as they relate to nerve injury and repair in humans is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the incidence of long-term sequelae after meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), we studied 11 children who had MAS at age 8.2 +/- 0.2 years (mean +/- SD) and nine healthy control subjects with pulmonary function and exercise stress tests. The MAS children had evidence of mild airway obstruction, hyperinflation, and increased closing volumes in comparison with control values. During graded exercise stress tests on a treadmill, MAS children achieved normal maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold without a significant fall in arterial oxygen saturation or increase in CO2 tension. Exercise-induced bronchospasm occurred in four (36%) MAS subjects but in none of the control subjects. We conclude that children surviving MAS have long-term pulmonary sequelae, including airway obstruction, hyperinflation, elevated closing volumes, and airway hyperreactivity; yet they achieve normal aerobic capacity. These findings are similar, although less severe, than those after prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

  ".W": "After an experimental neonatal screening program for cystic fibrosis had been carried out in the Netherlands during 1973 to 1979, a follow-up study to evaluate the effects of neonatal screening was started in 1980. Although before 1980 the management of patients with cystic fibrosis was partly left to local hospitals, from the start of the follow-up program all patients in the study received similar treatment. A cumulative survival rate, calculated with exclusion of the patients with meconium ileus, showed at the age of 11 years a significantly better survival rate (p less than 0.05) for the 19 patients from the screened population (88%) than for the 25 patients from the nonscreened population (60%). Clinical condition was assessed on entry and at the age of 9 years in 16 screened and 20 nonscreened patients. On entry, comparison showed significantly better chest radiograph scores for the screened patients but no other significant differences. At the age of 9 years, after several years of similar treatment for all patients in the study, significantly better clinical (p less than 0.02) and chest radiograph scores (p less than 0.01), lower IgG levels (p less than 0.05), and higher vitamin A levels (p less than 0.01) were observed in the screened patients. Our study results suggest that early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may prevent serious deterioration and death at a young age, and may reduce the extent of early irreversible lung damage in patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of nocturnal oxygen therapy on mortality and morbidity rates and on progression of disease was tested in a double-blind, randomized trial of 28 subjects with advanced cystic fibrosis. Patients were selected on the basis that their awake arterial oxygen tension was less than 65 mm Hg when they were clinically stable. Oxygen was prescribed in 1 L/min increments to obtain an awake arterial oxygen tension of greater than or equal to 70 mm Hg. Subjects received humidified oxygen or room air from modified concentrators. They were enrolled over a 3-year period and followed for an average (+/- SD) of 26 +/- 9 months. The average number of hours per night of concentrator use was 5.3 +/- 3.2 hours in the air group and 7.0 +/- 1.9 hours in the oxygen group. Over the follow-up period there were four deaths in each group, and oxygen therapy had no significant effect on the frequency of hospitalizations. Progression of disease was ascertained from nutritional status, pulmonary function, blood gas values, exercise ability, and right ventricular ejection fraction response to exercise (as measured by equilibrium-gated radionuclide angiocardiography), and psychologic status was measured by standardized tests of mood, self-esteem, and cognitive function; group comparisons for the first year revealed no significant differences; however, school or work attendance was maintained in the oxygen group but deteriorated in the air group. Clinical signs of cor pulmonale were documented during follow-up in 10 patients in toto, and all lived at least 9 months from the onset of these signs. The lack of association between the onset of these signs and imminent death, or the usefulness of measurements of the maximal oxygen uptake during progressive exercise and the right ventricular ejection fraction response to exercise as prognostic indicators, suggest that death may not be the result of cor pulmonale. We conclude that nocturnal oxygen treatment in patients with cystic fibrosis did not appear to affect mortality rates, the frequency of hospitalizations, or the progression of disease; oxygen use should be instituted only after the development of symptoms related to hypoxemia.\r"

The 51 (41%) physicians who responded included those practicing in many specialties from a variety of hospital settings throughout Illinois. The majority of respondents had less than 4 years' experience with ventilator-assisted children and were in their earlier years of practice. Most physicians surveyed had participated in discharge planning and maintained an active role with their patients at home after discharge. The majority believed that changes in ventilatory settings could be accomplished in the home and found hospitalization unnecessary for adjustments of the home care prescription. The physicians thought that the roles and responsibilities should be defined for both the tertiary and community-based physician before hospital discharge, and that development and support of resources at the community level were essential for the success of home care.\r"

  ".W": "The detection of carriers of the X-linked disorder hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is problematic because of random X-inactivation; the diagnosis was previously based on the observation of subtle defects in ectodermal structures in at-risk females. Linkage studies have recently mapped hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia to the region Xq11-q21.1. We assessed the improvement in carrier detection by the method of linkage analysis, in which restriction fragment length polymorphisms were used as markers, in 72 at-risk female members of 29 families. Carriers analyses were based on pedigree information, dental examination of at-risk females (phenotype), and DNA analyses at seven linked marker loci. Linkage analysis based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms significantly improved risk estimates over those based on phenotype and pedigree alone. When all available information was combined, 85% (61/72) of the at-risk females had final risks of less than 5% or greater than 95%, and 68% (49/72) had risks less than 1% or greater than 99%. A diagnosis of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia was also excluded (97.5% probability) by DNA and linkage analyses from a sample of cord blood from an at-risk male; a similar approach can be taken for prenatal diagnosis of the disorder.\r"

Plasma thiamine concentration was low in one patient and normal in the other; in both children, thiamine pyrophosphate in erythrocytes and thiamine pyrophosphokinase activity were lower than the lowest values observed in control subjects. A month after institution of treatment with thiamine, the hematologic findings had returned to normal and the insulin requirements had decreased. Withdrawal of thiamine repeatedly induced relapse of the anemia and an increase in insulin requirements. We propose that an inherited abnormality of thiamine metabolism is responsible for the multisystem degenerative disorder known as DIDMOAD syndrome.\r"

Forty-one percent of the 395 central venous catheters placed during this interval were femoral. Noninfectious complications were recognized for 2.5% of femoral catheters and 2.1% of nonfemoral catheters. Only three complications occurred with catheter insertion, all during nonfemoral attempts. Systemic infections that were possibly attributable to the central venous catheter were found in 3.7% of patients with femoral catheters and 7.3% of those with nonfemoral catheters. Femoral venous catheterization offers several practical advantages for central access over other sites. The low incidence of complications documented in this study suggests that the femoral vein is the preferred site in most critically ill children when central venous catheterization is indicated.\r"

All management was with one type of ventilator (model IV100B, Sechrist Industries Inc., Anaheim, Calif.) and one type of humidifier (model MR 500, Fisher and Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), and infants were placed under radiant heaters. Outcome for infants weighing greater than or equal to 1500 gm at birth was no different at low (less than or equal to 36.5 degrees C) versus high (greater than 36.5 degrees C) values of mean inspired gas temperature during the first 96 hours. However, infants weighing less than 1500 gm at birth had less respiratory morbidity at the higher temperatures; there was a reduction in the incidence of pneumothorax from 43% at low to 13% at high temperatures (p = 0.006) and a reduction in the severity of chronic lung disease, measured as mean Fio2 at 29 days in survivors, from 37.2% at low to 27.5% at high temperatures (p = 0.001). Clinical evaluation of the humidifier, as it was used in this study, suggested that temperature settings less than 36.5 degrees C were associated with inspired gas humidity between 28 and 36 mg H2O/L. For any humidifier, there may be a critical threshold for inspired gas humidity below which the risk of respiratory complications in very low birth weight babies is increased. This hypothesis requires rigorous scrutiny by controlled trial. In future studies, direct measurements of inspired gas humidity are needed to make a precise estimate of the optimal level.\r"

Microanalytic high-performance liquid chromatography was used to quantitate both CTX and dCTX from serum. A two-compartment open model best characterized the disposition of CTX during a 24-hour post-dose period. The disposition of dCTX was adequately characterized by a one-compartment model. The elimination half-life, apparent steady-state volume of distribution, and total body clearance of CTX (mean +/- SEM) were 4.44 hours, 0.461 +/- 0.027 L/kg, and 0.074 +/- 0.003 L/hr/kg, respectively. Peak concentrations (mean +/- SD) of dCTX (17.96 +/- 5.54 mg/L) occurred at 0.6 to 8.3 hours (5.9 +/- 1.9 hours) after CTX administration, and the apparent elimination half-life of dCTX was 9.36 hours. Comparison of CTX and dCTX pharmacokinetic parameters between very low birth weight neonates who weighed less than 1000 gm (n = 9; 703.3 +/- 46.6 gm; 27.0 +/- 0.8 weeks gestational age) and greater than or equal to 1000 gm (n = 9; 1328.8 +/- 48.6 gm; 29.8 +/- 0.5 weeks gestational age) revealed no significant differences, but significant linear correlations were found between gestational age and weight versus CTX half-life and total body clearance. Because of the prolonged clearance of both CTX and dCTX in the very low birth weight neonate, a CTX dose of 50 mg/kg every 24 hours may provide effective serum concentrations for susceptible infections outside the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether clinicians correctly identify newborn infants who are at high risk of child maltreatment, we examined the outcomes of high-risk and non-high-risk children. Infants who were born at Yale-New Haven Hospital from 1979 to 1981 and who were referred by clinicians during the postpartum period to the hospital's child abuse registry because they were considered at high risk of child abuse or neglect became the high-risk group. For each high-risk infant, a comparison infant was selected and matched according to date of birth, gender, race, and method of payment for the hospitalization. For both groups, the occurrence of maltreatment was ascertained by reviewing the medical records until the child's fourth birthday. Each injury for which medical care was sought was classified into one of seven categories (from definite child abuse to accident) by a pediatrician who was unaware of the child's risk status. Information also was recorded about nonorganic failure to thrive and changes in the child's caretaker. Maltreatment (defined as abuse or neglect) occurred more frequently in the high-risk group than the comparison group (adjusted matched odds ratio = 4.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.41, 6.93; p less than 0.001), as did poor weight gain from a nonorganic cause (matched odds ratio = 7.0; 95% confidence interval = 1.59, 30.79; p less than 0.01) and changes in the child's caretaker (matched odds ratio = 9.0; 95% confidence interval = 3.80; 20.55; p less than 0.001). We conclude that as early as the postpartum period, clinicians can identify some families who are at high risk of maltreatment and other major adverse outcomes resulting from poor parenting.\r"

The null hypothesis of no group differences between survivors and control subjects was tested with respect to these variables. It was hypothesized that survivors with severe late effects would have poorer self-concepts, a more external locus of control, and more depressive symptoms than children with no or mild-to-moderate late effects. The children completed the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale, the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale, and the Children's Depression Inventory. Mothers completed the Family Environment Scale and the Derogatis Stress Profile. The majority of former patients are functioning within normative limits on these standardized measures, although their scores were lower than those in the comparison group. One-way analyses of variance on the dependent measures indicate that the children with severe medical late effects have a poorer total self-concept, more depressive symptoms, and a more external locus of control than those with no or mild-to-moderate late effects. Therapies for childhood cancer are now well standardized and many long-term deleterious effects are known, so children at risk can be identified readily and steps taken early in treatment to prevent or mitigate future psychologic problems.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the psychosocial responses of children and adolescents with a cardiac pacemaker and compare their responses to those of their peers, we evaluated 30 pediatric pacemaker patients, aged 7 to 19 years, and two age- and sex-matched comparison groups, including 30 patients with similar heart disease but without pacemakers and 30 physically healthy children, using standardized psychometric tests and a specific interview format. We postulated that children with pacemakers would experience greater stress in psychosocial adaptation. No significant differences on standardized measures of trait anxiety, self-competence, or self-esteem were found between the pacemaker group and the comparison groups. In contrast, pacemaker subjects were significantly (p less than 0.05) more external in their locus-of-control orientation than were healthy subjects, suggesting a diminished sense of personal control and less autonomy. Pacemaker subjects, particularly the older ones, had significantly (p less than 0.05) greater knowledge of pacemaker systems than did subjects in the other two groups, facilitating the use of intellectualization as a coping mechanism. The pacemaker patients were likely to be as fearful of social rejection as of potential pacemaker failure. All three groups identified potential negative peer reactions toward an individual with a pacemaker. The patients with cardiac disease but without pacemakers and the healthy subjects perceived significant (p less than 0.05) social and emotional differences between patients with pacemakers and their peers, but the pacemaker patients did not view themselves as different from their peers. This study demonstrates healthy psychosocial adaptation of children with cardiac pacemakers. Although these children appear to cope effectively with the stress of their life situation through the use of denial and intellectualization, they may experience problems both in the development of autonomy and in social isolation and rejection.\r"

When interferon alpha/beta was injected intratumorally or peritumorally, tumor growth was markedly suppressed, and established vascularized tumor nodules became progressively necrotic. Tumor necrosis was of the coagulation type that usually results from deprivation of blood flow. Morphologic examination of approximately 1,000 blood vessel profiles and approximately 2,000 endothelial cells in 1-micron Epon sections of sc 3C18 FLC tumors showed that interferon treatment resulted in rapid and pronounced vascular endothelial cell damage that preceded tumor necrosis. No inflammatory cell infiltrate was observed. Our results suggest that interferon alpha/beta exerted an antitumor effect in these tumor models by damaging tumor blood vessels, causing disruption of tumor blood flow, which led to ischemic tumor necrosis.\r"

The differentiation of lung and intestinal epithelium is known to be regulated by glucocorticoids. We show that glucocorticoid-induced development of alveolar lung volume is H-2 influenced and that glucocorticoid treatment of fetuses also influences prenatal ENU induction of lung and intestinal tumors. These glucocorticoid effects on tumorigenesis are also H-2 influenced. The number of papillary lung tumors increased in B10 (H-2b) and decreased in B10.A (H-2a) mice. In the intestine, the number of tumors increased in H-2b females and decreased in H-2b males. In H-2a mice, the number of intestinal tumors was unchanged but their location was altered. We propose that the H-2 complex influences tumorigenesis in lung and small intestine by affecting the hormonal regulation of differentiation of target epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested that loss of heterozygosity at loci on the short arm of human chromosome 11 (11p) may be important in the pathogenesis of benign and malignant adrenal cortical tumors. To test this concept, adrenocortical carcinomas from nine patients and benign adrenal cortical lesions from eight patients were tested for loss of alleles at loci on human chromosomes 11, 13, and 17. All patients with adrenocortical carcinoma whose normal somatic tissues were heterozygous for a locus on chromosome 17p had lost alleles in the tumor. Four of six patients with adrenocortical carcinoma who were heterozygous for one or more alleles on chromosome 11p in normal tissues had lost 11p alleles in the tumor. Three of six patients with adrenocortical carcinoma showed loss of 13q alleles in the tumor. Loss of alleles on chromosomes 11p, 13q, and 17p was observed in primary tumors and metastases but not in adrenocortical adenomas or hyperplastic lesions of the adrenal cortex. One patient with adrenocortical carcinoma had a somatic mutation in the HRAS1 gene in the normal adrenal gland. The consistency of the genetic changes on chromosomes 11p, 13q, and 17p suggests that they are important in the pathogenesis of adrenocortical carcinoma.\r"

In the present study we treated athymic BALB/c mice bearing intracranial human glioma (D-54 MG) or medulloblastoma (TE-671) xenografts with melphalan alone or BSO followed by melphalan. Administration of BSO depleted intracellular glutathione to 7.5% of the control level. BSO plus melphalan resulted in a significant increase in median survival over that produced by melphalan alone: 45.3% versus 26.4% in TE-671 and 69% versus 27.6% in D-54 MG. These studies justify further efforts to modulate chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic interventions of primary malignant brain tumors by depletion of glutathione.\r"

However, chromosome analysis of some papillary RCCs suggested that this type of tumor differs genotypically from the most common nonpapillary RCCs. Therefore, by using cytogenetic and molecular genetic approaches, we examined human papillary and nonpapillary RCCs for the loss of heterozygosity or homozygosity at the short arm of chromosome 3. The constitutional heterozygosity for the DNF15S2 locus and for one allele of the c-erbA beta and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogenes was lost in nonpapillary RCCs, whereas both alleles were retained in each papillary RCC analyzed. We conclude that the loss of DNA sequences at the chromosome 3p region is a genomic change occurring consistently in nonpapillary RCCs, but never occurring in papillary RCCs.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty patients with malignant carcinoid tumors were treated for 6 months with recombinant interferon alfa-2b (IFN alpha-2b; Intron-A; Schering Corp., Bloomfield, NJ) at a mean dose of 5.9 megaunits three times per week. Eleven of the 20 patients (55%) had a greater than 50% reduction of tumor markers (urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid or plasma neuropeptide K), showing objective tumor response. Six patients (30%) had stable disease with no significant change in tumor markers or tumor size, and three (15%) had progressive disease with an increase in tumor markers and size. These results are similar to those reported earlier for treatment with natural leukocyte IFN in patients with carcinoid tumors. Only two patients (35%) had a slight reduction of tumor size after 6 months of treatment. Three patients developed neutralizing antibodies to IFN alpha-2b. Two of these patients initially showed an objective response, which lasted until IFN antibodies developed. In one of these patients, a change to human leukocyte IFN resulted in normalization of antibody titers within 3 months, and the patient had a second objective clinical response. There was no correlation between development of IFN antibodies and development of autoimmune phenomena such as increased titers of antinuclear antibodies or thyroid autoantibodies. IFN alpha-2b seems to be as potent as human leukocyte IFN in the treatment of patients with malignant carcinoid tumors, but it is important to recognize that antibodies neutralizing IFN may develop in some patients, with concomitant loss of antitumor effects. A change to natural leukocyte IFN might be beneficial in these patients.\r"

Factors that were evaluated to determine their effect on long-term patency included graft age and material, graft location, and the presence or absence of an underlying correctable lesion.

The objective of this investigation was to compare the sensitivity of different noninvasive platelet parameters with the assessment of the result of endothelial cell seeding. Scanning electron microscopic investigation of circulating blood platelets showed a significantly higher incidence of activated platelets in patients with seeded or nonseeded PTFE grafts, compared with patients after reversed vein graft implantation. \"Shape-changed\" platelets, as well as membrane-perforated thrombocytes, were found exclusively in the circulating blood of patients after seeded or nonseeded PTFE graft implantation, indicative of platelet trauma by the artificial graft surface. Plasma levels of platelet factor IV and beta-thromboglobulin, as well as the uptake of indium-111-labeled platelets, failed to show statistically significant differences after 1 year of follow-up. The similar results for seeded and nonseeded grafts indicate the failure of endothelial cell seeding to induce the development of a nontraumatizing surface, comparable to that of saphenous vein grafts.\r"

The contents were gel-like and composed of 1.64 gm of hyaluronic acid and 0.20 gm of protein per dl. This material did not possess boundary-lubricating ability in a test system that slides natural latex rubber against glass. The histologic appearance, chemical composition, and absence of lubricating ability more closely resemble the characteristics of ganglions.

The open architecture of the filter allows it to maintain caval patency better than other mechanical devices, but this design also permits passage of emboli up to 3 mm in diameter. Although such small emboli do not produce symptoms in the pulmonary circuit, they can be devastating in the cerebral circulation. For this reason, the Greenfield filter may be inadequate treatment for paradoxical embolism. Ligation of the inferior vena cava is proposed as an alternative that provides better protection against small emboli.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a slime-producing strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis was capable of producing acute infection of a prosthetic vascular graft, 5 cm segments of knitted Dacron were implanted in the infrarenal aortic position of dogs in three groups of animals. These included a control group (no graft contamination), a contaminated group that received a graft soaked in an S. epidermidis solution (untreated group), and a contaminated group in which perioperative antibiotics (three doses of cefamandole, 100 mg/kg) were administered (prophylaxis group). In all the animals reexploration and graft removal were performed at 10 days, with replacement of the defect being achieved with a new uncontaminated graft. These animals underwent exploration a third time after an additional 10-day period. S. epidermidis was not grown from the control animals (n = 7) but was cultured in 44% of the prophylaxis group (n = 9) and 88% of the untreated group (n = 16) during at least one of the operative procedures (chi 2 = 15.859; p less than 0.001). The pathologic features of acute S. epidermidis infection were best seen in the untreated animals and included anastomotic disruption (56%), periaortic hematoma, and lymphadenopathy (94%). Microscopic examination of the aortic tissues revealed extensive infiltrates of leukocytes, macrophages, and foreign body giant cells with aortic necrosis. These features were less prominent in the prophylaxis animals. We conclude that S. epidermidis is capable of producing acute graft infection with perigraft inflammation and anastomotic disruption. The administration of perioperative antibiotics reduced but did not abolish these effects of bacterial contamination of prosthetic vascular grafts.\r"

Gore Associates Inc., Elkton, Md.), Dacron and Gore-Tex in combination, and saphenous vein. Twenty of 21 patients had successful preservation of graft function, local wound healing, and control of infection. There were no amputations or deaths. The one failure was caused by incomplete debridement of an infected graft segment. Aggressive debridement and rotational muscle flap coverage is an effective means of treating locally infected vascular bypass grafts.\r"

  ".W": "Four patients with occlusive complications after percutaneous transluminal renal artery angioplasty (PTA) have been treated from July 1, 1984, to March 14, 1988. During this interval such renal artery angioplasties were performed in 44 patients. Two resulted in complete main renal artery occlusion, one angioplasty resulted in occlusion of a stenotic renal artery bypass graft, and one renal PTA resulted in segmental branch renal artery narrowing, which was thought to represent a dissection. The latter segmental renal artery narrowing was treated expectantly with good long-term results. One of the main renal artery occlusions was treated by radiologic means by reentry and repeat transluminal dilation. The other two acute complete occlusions, one of an autogenous artery and the other of an aortorenal bypass graft, were treated by aortorenal or ileorenal bypass grafting, respectively. The overall incidence of main renal artery occlusion (including the bypass graft occlusion) after PTA requiring operative intervention was 4.5% (2/44). Revascularization was accomplished after 6 and 8 hours of renal ischemia time for the two surgical procedures. Despite this, the bypass grafts done emergently remain patent, and the involved kidneys appear to be functional. The incidence of main renal artery occlusion after PTA is not as low as would be apparent from a review of the literature. It is proposed that main renal artery occlusion after PTA can be treated successfully by surgical and interventional radiologic techniques because of the presence of protective renal collateral circulation whose formation was stimulated by the renal artery lesion that prompted PTA.\r"

Intravenous administration of a pharmacologic dosage of epinephrine (222 ng/kg per min) caused gastric dysrhythmia in 8 of 12 healthy subjects. After indomethacin treatment, the incidence of epinephrine-induced gastric dysrhythmia was reduced to 4 of 12 healthy subjects, which is similar to the incidence of gastric dysrhythmia noted in the placebo group. The difference, however, was not statistically significant (P = 0.2). Epinephrine also substantially inhibited both the amplitude and the frequency of antral contractions. Indomethacin treatment partially reversed the reduction in the amplitude but not the frequency of antral contractions. These results suggest that endogenous prostaglandins may, in part, regulate the amplitude of human antral contractions; however, the role of prostaglandins in epinephrine-induced gastric dysrhythmia in humans remains uncertain.\r"

During 85 bronchoscopy sessions, 89 TBNAs were performed in 84 patients. Seventy-three aspirates were obtained from 68 patients who were eventually proved to have a malignant lesion. Of these 68 patients, 25 had positive results of TBNA (37%). Of these 25 patients, 15 had non-small-cell cancers (11 bronchogenic and 4 metastatic from extrapulmonary sites), and 10 had small-cell carcinomas. In patients with a malignant lesion, 23% of the central aspirates (from paratracheal regions or within 2 cm of the carina) and 65% of the distal aspirates (beyond 2 cm from the carina) were positive (a total yield of 34%). Five of the distal aspirates were obtained from peripheral lesions under fluoroscopic guidance, and three were positive for a malignant process. In eight patients, the only malignant finding at bronchoscopy was the aspirate. Two of the eight patients had carcinoma metastatic to the lung, three had small-cell carcinoma, and the other three had bronchogenic carcinoma. In five patients, TBNA obviated more invasive diagnostic measures. We find TBNA to be useful in selected patients. It increases our diagnostic yield for small-cell carcinoma and carcinoma metastatic to the chest. TBNA should be considered when a submucosal process is present, extrinsic compression is evident, or an accessible extrabronchial mass is found radiographically.\r"

Diagnosing this condition is often difficult because of the patient's debilitated medical condition and the limitations of biliary imaging techniques. During a 5-year study period (1981 through 1986), 20 patients underwent assessment and treatment for acute acalculous cholecystitis at our institution. This observation suggests an increase in incidence in comparison with a previously reported review of 28 such patients during a 16-year period at our institution. Initial treatment consisted of cholecystectomy in 18 patients, and percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy was successfully used in the other 2 patients. The postoperative mortality and morbidity for these 20 patients were 30% and 55%, respectively. Percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy should be explored further as a treatment option for acute acalculous cholecystitis.\r"

Clinically apparent systemic hypercortisolism is virtually nonexistent in patients who receive such therapy, although local effects of candidiasis or dysphonia may occur. Treatment failures can often be attributed to poor patient compliance or incorrect use of the pressurized aerosol inhaler. The addition of a spacer device to the inhaler improves the technique and the results in many patients. Furthermore, many patients with asthma require 2 or 3 times the conventional dose of aerosol corticosteroids for optimal control of pulmonary function. Careful coaching is essential for the successful use of aerosol corticosteroids.\r"

The results were typical of Britain as a whole. A new graph, called the HOTH graph (\"how often that high?\"), shows the percentage of the population with serum total cholesterol at or above any given value. Median (equal to mean) cholesterol levels in men were 5.5, 6.0, 6.3, and 6.2 mmol/l in successive 10-year age groups 25-64, whilst equivalent values in women were 5.2, 5.5, 6.4, and 7.2 mmol/l. By comparison with other countries these are high, but the percentage of the population above specific cutpoints is disproportionate, varying considerably by age and sex. Application of imported cholesterol management algorithms, based on global cut-points, would lead to an overwhelming caseload of patients needing intensive lipid investigation and management, dominated by older women, and incurring great costs. 35% of the population 25-64 years old would be at or above 6.5 mmol/l and 11% at or above 7.8 mmol/l. A population diet and multiple-risk-factor strategy would be more feasible and rational than a one-dimensional cholesterol cut-point approach.\r"

  ".W": "Two babies in a neonatal unit presented on the same day with meningitis due to echovirus 11, which was thought to have been introduced by staff. At this time echovirus 11 was also isolated from the stools of eight other babies; five of them did not have signs of infection. No intervention was made except to emphasise the importance of handwashing. There was evidence of secondary spread to two babies who were both clinically well. The attack rate was twelve (29%) of forty-one babies exposed. Seven of the twelve infected babies were born before 30 weeks' gestation and would have had little or no maternal antibody, yet only two of the seven babies had signs of infection. Despite lack of special measures, all babies recovered. Most cases of horizontally acquired neonatal echovirus infection are mild: extreme measures in the management of outbreaks are unnecessary.\r"
