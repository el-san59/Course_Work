  ".W": "To investigate the natural history of stage A chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) we reviewed 84 such patients. Among 74 cases evaluable for disease progression, 22 (29.6%) progressed to more advanced clinical stages (9 to stage B, 13 to stage C); the actuarial estimation of such an event at 4 years was 30% (95% CI: 26.3% to 33.6%). Despite a linear trend toward an increasing risk (r = .92), the hazard function analysis showed a constant pattern of progression, suggesting a lack of correlation of such an event with time (r = .04). Furthermore, disease progression when analyzed as a time-dependent variable had a clear-cut impact on survival (P less than .001). With the aim of identifying a subgroup of patients with low probability of disease progression and death, we applied to our set of patients four different proposals for subclassifying stage A. All methods were similar in terms of sample size, 5-year survival rate, and disease progression risk, suggesting that the choice between different proposals is somewhat arbitrary. Whatever the criteria are for defining \"smoldering\" CLL, such patients (accounting in the present study for 20.5% of overall series and 46.7% of stage A patients) should not be treated until progression occurs.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred ninety-three asymptomatic patients with hereditary coagulation disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were studied in a controlled trial of zidovudine (ZDV) versus a placebo (with an average of 9.7 months on study). Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced between the placebo and drug-treated groups, including CD4 distributions, types of clotting disorders, transaminase abnormalities, and use of various hemostatic agents. At the time of analysis, 161 patients either were still receiving treatment or had previously reached an endpoint of disease progression while receiving treatment. Twenty-five patients withdrew voluntarily. The toxic effects noted included granulocytopenia and anemia, especially in older patients, and subjective symptoms of asthenia, malaise, and nausea, consistent with the known consequences of treatment with 300 mg ZDV five times daily. There was a trend toward more diagnoses of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), advanced or early AIDS-related complex (ARC), single ARC symptoms, or death in placebo recipients as compared with those receiving ZDV (22 v 13). Because older patients with hemophilia have more rapid disease progression, the same efficacy analysis was performed in the 89 patients aged more than 30 years who were receiving treatment. In this subgroup, there was a similar trend (11 v 6). With regard to the most advanced problems of the infection among the older patients, there were five patients who were newly diagnosed with AIDS or died in the placebo group versus none in the ZDV group (P = .02) among the older patients. The pretreatment distribution of CD4 counts for the placebo and ZDV groups were similar, but patients aged more than 30 years had significantly (P less than .049) fewer CD4 cells than patients aged less than 30 years. A beneficial ZDV effect is also supported by a trend toward higher CD4 counts (a 48-cell increase in the ZDV group at 24 weeks as compared with a four-cell increase in the placebo group) and a significant (P = .03) difference in weight gain in the ZDV patients aged more than 30 years (8 pounds) as compared with the older placebo patients (aged more than 30 years) (2 pounds) at week 24. The findings in the asymptomatic hemophilic patients aged more than 30 years support a useful effect of ZDV, which is similar to observations in the larger study of its use in asymptomatic, nonhemophilic patients.\r"

Daily doses ranged from 100 to 2,000 micrograms/m2/d. Toxicity, such as constitutional symptoms, directly ascribed to rhM-CSF was not observed; however, transient, dose-related thrombocytopenia was observed. Patients who received 2,000 micrograms/m2/d of rhM-CSF had a mean reduction in platelet count of 61,000/mm3 during the rhM-CSF infusion period, which was significant when compared with patients who received lower doses of rhM-CSF (P = .008). Fourteen of the 16 patients who received rhM-CSF after undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had no change in the severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while receiving rhM-CSF. One had an increase in the severity of GVHD and one had a decrease. There were no effects on neutrophil, monocyte, or lymphocyte counts. Six patients had resolution of their infections, 12 were not evaluable for response, and six did not respond. Ten patients survived 100 days after initiation of rhM-CSF and 14 died. Further trials with rhM-CSF to assess antifungal activity are indicated.\r"

Either interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or IL-4 alone support CFU-S in vitro. The effects of IL-3 or G-CSF could be neutralized by adding antibodies against IL-3 or G-CSF, respectively. However, the effects of IL-4 could be neutralized with antibodies to IL-4 as well as with antibodies to IL-3 and G-CSF. The combinations of IL-3 and IL-6, IL-3 and G-CSF, IL-3 and IL-1 alpha, IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and IL-4 and IL-6 acted synergistically to increase CFU-S number. Addition of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) to IL-3 and IL-6 inhibited the increase in CFU-S number. Repopulating stem cell function was measured in a competitive repopulation assay. Either IL-3 or IL-4 alone could preserve stem cell function in vitro. The combinations of IL-3 and IL-6, and IL-3 and G-CSF increased stem cell function approximately twofold. The combinations of IL-3 + G-CSF + IL-6, and IL-4 and IL-6 (both of which increased CFU-S number fivefold to 10-fold) decreased stem cell function approximately fourfold. These results demonstrate that certain combinations of growth factors can increase CFU-S number at the expense of stem cell function.\r"

  ".U": "91329841\r", 
  ".W": "Although insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation upon addition to the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line FDC-P1, IGF-1 did not relieve IL-3 dependency for growth. To further examine the effects of IGF-1 on hematopoietic cells, FDC-P1 cells were infected with a retroviral construct (LISN) containing the human IGF-1 receptor (hIGF-1R) and neo genes. IL-3-independent cells were readily isolated after LISN infection when either IGF-1 or supraphysiologic concentrations of insulin were included in the culture medium. These cells were transformed to IL-3 independence by a ligand-dependent mechanism because their growth was dependent on the presence of either IGF-1 or insulin and growth factors capable of supporting autocrine growth were not detected. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against the human IGF-1R (alpha IR-3) inhibited IGF-1 but not IL-3-induced proliferation and these cells contained 20- to 200-fold more IGF-1 receptors than uninfected FDC-P1 cells. In contrast, when LISN-infected cells were plated in medium without exogenously supplied IGF-1 or insulin, factor-independent cells were rarely isolated. Growth of these cells was also inhibited by the alpha IR-3 MoAb and they expressed 100- to 400-fold more IGF-1 receptors than uninfected FDC-P1 cells. The endogenous IGF-1 and/or insulin present in the calf serum may have enabled their growth because these cells, unlike the parental cells, would proliferate in serum-free defined media and their growth was again inhibited by the alpha IR-3 MoAb. These results demonstrate that IGF-1 can replace IL-3 for growth when FDC-P1 cells overexpress the IGF-1R. Given the fairly ubiquitous expression of the IGF-1 receptor, these and additional experiments might help to determine whether increased expression of endogenous receptors by cells can lead to leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis. Moreover, hIGF-1R-infected cells will be useful in investigating the mechanisms of IGF1-mediated signal transduction because they are now known to proliferate in response to IGF-1.\r"

The cDNA is 850 base pairs (bp) long and encodes a peptide of 144 amino acids. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology between caGM-CSF and human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF) is 80% and 70%, respectively. A mammalian expression vector pCMV/CAGM was constructed and used to transfect COS cells for expression of caGM-CSF. Supernatant from transfected COS cells enriched with caGM-CSF was shown to have significant stimulating activity in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit (CFU-GM) assays of canine marrow. caGM-CSF, expressed from bacteria, was used to treat seven dogs at varying doses twice daily subcutaneously (sc) for 14 to 16 days. Circulating blood neutrophils and monocytes increased significantly. The increase in circulating eosinophils was variable. Thrombocytopenia developed during administration of caGM-CSF but corrected rapidly after cessation of treatment. Evaluation of survival times of 51Cr-labeled autologous platelets suggested increased consumption as the primary reason for thrombocytopenia. A species-specific GM-CSF will be a useful tool for hematologic or immunologic studies in dogs.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic exposure of humans to benzene (BZ), a myelotoxin, causes aplastic anemia and acute leukemia. The stromal macrophage that produces interleukin-1 (IL-1), a cytokine essential for hematopoiesis, is a target of BZ's toxicity. Monocyte dysfunction and decreased IL-1 production have been shown to be involved in aplastic anemia in humans. Hydroquinone (HQ), a toxic bone marrow (BM) metabolite of BZ, causes time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of processing of the 34-Kd pre-interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) to the 17-Kd mature cytokine in murine P388D1 macrophages and BM stromal macrophages, as measured by Western immunoblots of cell lysate proteins using a polyclonal rabbit antimurine IL-1 alpha antibody. HQ over a 10-fold concentration range had no effect on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of pre-IL-1 alpha precursor or on cell viability or DNA and protein synthesis. Stromal macrophages obtained from the femoral BM of C57Bl/6 mice exposed to BZ (600 or 800 mg/kg body weight) for 2 days were incapable of processing the 34-Kd pre-IL-1 alpha to the mature 17-Kd cytokine when stimulated in culture with LPS. Stromal macrophages from mice coadministered BZ and indomethacin, a prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) inhibitor that has been shown to prevent BZ-induced myelotoxic and genotoxic effects in mice when coadministered with benzene were able to convert the pre-IL-1 alpha to mature cytokine. Administration of recombinant murine IL-1 alpha (rMuIL-1 alpha) to mice before a dose of BZ that causes severe depression of BM cellularity completely prevents BM depression, most probably by bypassing the inability of the stromal macrophage in BZ-treated animals to process pre-IL-1 alpha to the mature cytokine.\r"

Several classes of BM cells can reconstitute Dexter cultures, first forming discrete \"cobblestone\" areas which then mature into colonies consisting primarily of maturing myeloid and erythroid cells. Most such colonies have a limited lifespan in culture. Only the Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ cell fraction gives rise to colonies that survive longer than 3 weeks, which suggests that a limiting-dilution analysis for long-term reconstitution of Dexter cultures can serve as a quantitative measure of stem cell activity. Additional experiments were performed to assess the formation of new progenitor cells in reconstituted Dexter cultures. Again, only cultures seeded with the stem cell-enriched fraction contained expanded numbers of replatable WEHI-3 CM responsive colony-forming cells (CFU-GM). Quantitative analysis indicates that 97% of the replatable CFU-GM of whole BM is contributed by the Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ cell fraction, again suggesting a potential stem cell-specific assay. Such quantitative in vitro assays might prove useful in characterization and isolation of human stem cells where in vivo assays are lacking.\r"

Loss of viability in these differentiating leukemic cells in the absence of growth factor was associated with DNA fragmentation and morphologic changes typical of programmed cell death (apoptosis). The differentiating leukemic cells could be rescued from apoptosis by a hematopoietic growth factor such as interleukin-3 (IL-3) and by the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), but not by the nonpromoting phorbol ester 4-alpha-TPA. IL-3 and TPA rescued differentiating myeloid leukemic cells by different pathways and also rescued normal myeloid precursor cells from apoptosis. The rescue of differentiating leukemic and normal myeloid cells by IL-3 or TPA was blocked by amiloride inhibitors of the Na+/H+ antiporter. We suggest that TPA may act as a tumor promoter by inhibiting programmed cell death.\r"

Mutations of either c-kit or the SCF gene are responsible for the defects of W and SI mutant mice, which both suffer a macrocytic anemia, the former associated with defective stem cells and the latter with a defective hematopoietic microenvironment. PEGylated recombinant rat SCF was administered to normal or splenectomized mice for up to 21 days. SCF was found to be a modest stimulator of peripheral blood neutrophil numbers in both groups of animals. The peak in neutrophil numbers was higher and occurred earlier in splenectomized mice. Bone marrow and spleen cellularity changed little during treatment but the content of interleukin-3-responsive progenitor cells and spleen colony-forming cells (CFU-S) reached very high levels, particularly in the spleen. Using recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), we have shown that SCF induces a greater than additive increase in both blood neutrophils and blood-borne CFU-S. This synergy was seen throughout the dose range and may indicate a clinical role for SCF either alone or in augmenting the activity of G-CSF upon blood neutrophils and transplantable stem cells.\r"

Using density centrifugation, negative panning with concanavalin A coated plates, positive selection of CD34-positive cells with immunomagnetic microspheres, overnight adherence to a plastic dish, negative selection with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, and density centrifugation, human marrow progenitor cells were purified from 1.5% to 53.2%, a 42-fold purification, with a 4.8% yield. The purified cells consisted of 38% erythroid, 9% colony forming unit-granulocyte (CFU-G), 29% CFU-macrophage (CFU-M), 12% CFU-eosinophil/basophil (CFU-Eo/Ba), and 4% CFU-mix. The purified cells cultured in serum-free fibrin clots with recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rM-CSF) for 14 days developed a pure population of CFU-M colonies. An appearance of CFU-M colonies was present after the addition of 1 U/mL of rM-CSF and the maximum stimulation was found at 100 U/mL. When the purified cells were cultured in serum-free medium with rM-CSF in a limiting dilution assay and the percentage of nonresponder wells for CFU-M colonies was plotted against cell concentration, serum-free cultures yielded a straight line through the origin, indicating that CFU-M development did not depend on accessory cells and that rM-CSF acted directly on the CFU-M.\r"

In diaphyseal femoral marrow, bone-lining cells are largely osteoblasts, indifferent endosteum, blood cells, and reticular cells. Hematopoiesis is sustained by rather differentiated progenitors, as myelocytes and polychromatophilic erythroblasts. But in sharply restricted loci within trabeculated bone in the distal medial femoral metaphysis, bone-lining cells are dominated by newly discovered fibroblastic, contractile, stromal barrier cells; activated, multilaminar and branched, enveloping putative stem cells; and extending into the marrow, where they enclose hematopoietic clusters of rather early progenitors, as promyelocytes; and basophilic erythroblasts. Barrier cells may endocytize granules released individually by vicinal differentiating granulocytes, preventing tissue damage. Barrier cells envelope blood vessels and insinuate processes into their wall, augmenting blood-marrow barriers, preventing release of immature cells. Further, extensions of venous sinuses made of extraordinarily thin barrier cell processes receive released blood cells. With heightened hematopoiesis due to mutant hemolytic anemias or after administration of interleukin-1, barrier cells and their associated structures are greatly increased, spreading beyond normally restricted loci. But in microenvironment-deficient mutants, barrier cells are fewer, less activated, and less granulated. Barrier cells thus appear important in hematopoiesis and in the release of blood cells from bone marrow.\r"

Treatment of Epo-responsive Rauscher erythroleukemia cells with an anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotide to c-myb in the absence of other inducers downregulated myb protein markedly and caused hemoglobinization of the cells within 48 hours. Epo treatment, which downregulates c-myb in these cells, induced hemoglobinization to the same degree. Epo also induced the appearance of anion transport protein on the plasma membrane, consistent with terminal differentiation. In contrast, antisense c-myb did not induce this erythroid marker. The results are consistent with a role for myb protein in the regulation of hemoglobin synthesis.\r"

An F XII inhibitor was excluded. To partially characterize the molecular defect of the abnormal F XII, immunologic and functional studies were performed on the proposita's plasma. The abnormal F XII was a single chain molecule with the same molecular weight (80 Kd) and the same isoelectric points (pl, 5.9 to 6.8) as normal F XII. Dextran sulfate activation of the proposita's plasma showed no proteolytic cleavage of F XII even after 120 minutes, whereas F XII in pooled normal plasma, diluted 1:10 with CRM-negative F XII-deficient plasma, was completely cleaved after 40 minutes. Adsorption to kaolin was identical for both abnormal and normal F XII. In the presence of dextran sulfate and exogenous plasma kallikrein, the abnormal F XII was cleaved with the same rate as normal F XII. However, kallikrein-cleaved abnormal F XII was not able to cleave factor XI and plasma prekallikrein, in contrast to activated normal F XII. Thus, these studies show that the functional defect of this abnormal F XII, denoted as F XII Bern, is due to the lack of protease activity of the kallikrein-cleaved molecule. Therefore, the structural defect is likely to be located in the light chain region of F XII, containing the enzymatic active site.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has been successfully applied in unstable angina to carefully selected patients. In this study, PTCA was performed in 277 consecutive patients suffering from unstable angina and for whom bypass surgery was not a valid alternative because either of inoperable conditions or of emergency, or because surgery was not the best option. All patients were admitted first to the intensive care unit where an attempt was made to control unstable angina under conventional medical therapy using at least iv nitroderivative, heparin, and calcium blockers. After a standardized preparation PTCA was performed either as an emergency procedure in medically refractory unstable angina (107 cases) or as an elective procedure in controlled situations after a 7 to 10 days symptom-free period. Three hundred fifty-three coronary vessels were attempted. Results of this group are compared with those of a control group made of 670 consecutive stable patients recruited during the same period, and clinical characteristics are envisaged as potential predictive factors. Unstable angina is undoubtedly associated with a higher overall complication rate, but the immediate outcome is strongly affected by the clinical context. As an example, respective success and mortality rates are: 93% and 0% when a full revascularization is attempted; 91% and 0% in elective procedures in patients under 60; 87% and 1.2% in elective PTCA for multiple vessel disease; 80% and 6.5% in emergency PTCA; 80% and 11% in the overall triple vessel disease; 84% and 16% in patients with deeply altered ejection fraction; and 58% and 26% in triple vessel disease with 2 previously occluded coronary arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The risk of such reactions in protamine insulin-dependent patients is uncertain. One catheterization study reported a 50-fold greater risk while a second showed no increased risk! To clarify the risk, the records of 7,750 cardiac catheterization procedures between 1984 and 1987 were analyzed for presence of NPH or PZI insulin use, protamine administration, and any complications or adverse reactions. Protamine was administered in 3,341/7,750 procedures (43%), including 171 in diabetics receiving NPH insulin. Adverse reactions to protamine occurred in 2/3, 170 noninsulin patients, 0.06%, and adverse reactions due to probable NPH insulin sensitization occurred in 1/171, 0.6%, of NPH diabetics, p = .034. Meta-analysis of risk showed an odds ratio of 7.96 for the NPH diabetic patients, and combining these results with the other large series in the literature (269 NPH diabetics total) showed an odds ratio of 4.19 compared to a non-NPH insulin group. Meta-analysis of the surgical literature showed the risk in surgical patients to be 2.1% in NPH patients versus 0.12% with no NPH, with an odds ratio of 15.52. The greater incidence in surgical patients may be due to protamine sensitization at prior catheterization and to the larger dose of protamine administered to surgical patients.\r"

The data observed showed a statistically significant mean difference before and after volume expansion of right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular end diastolic and pulmonary capillary pressures. However, right atrial and pulmonary capillary pressures equilibration was not detected. The right atrial pressure form showed abnormal variations during inspiration. Dip and plateau right ventricular diastolic pressure configuration was recorded in 6 patients after expansion, was absent in 2 and questionable in 4. A deep Y descent with an M-shaped right atrial pressure form was recorded in all 12 patients. The explanation for these phenomena is unclear. Thus, in the absence of pressure equilibration and clinical evidence of constriction, the abnormalities recorded during rapid volume expansion should be cautiously interpreted.\r"

The atrial septal puncture site was located immediately below the aortic valve level, probably in the fossa ovalis, for the first 80 patients, and at mid distance between the aortic valve level and the diaphragm for the last 110. Hemodynamic data were similar in both groups. Fluoroscopic guidance for atrial septal puncture seemed capital for patients with scoliosis or in whom a vascular distortion (e.g., advanced pregnancy, right inferior vena cava absence) prevented a perfect parallelism between the needle curve and the needle outer index.\r"

Doppler signals of aortic flow were obtained simultaneously to invasive pressure recordings with a 2 MHz continuous wave transducer via the suprasternal echocardiographic window. The Doppler signals were recorded on magnetic tape and measurements were made with digital calipers by two independent, blinded observers. The following parameters were measured: peak velocity (V) and time from onset of ejection to peak velocity (T). V2/T, the variable of the derived formula, was calculated for each of the observer's measured parameters and showed a very high interobserver correlation. The two observers' measurements of each parameter were averaged for each patient and the resulting mean was used in calculating the V2/T and mean acceleration. 4. A good correlation of V2/T with invasively measured peak dP/dt was obtained. Our derived index of left ventricular function showed a higher correlation with peak dP/dt compared to other Doppler indices of ventricular function. V2/T may provide a noninvasive method for estimating peak dP/dt.\r"

Arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction appears to offer significantly diminished morbidity and thus offers more predictable rehabilitation, at least initially, after surgery. Improvements in instrumentation continue to refine the precision of this technique. Proper graft selection is an important issue that is paramount to the evolution of ligament reconstruction surgery. Although the central third patellar tendon is presently the operation by which all new techniques must be compared, the use of nonautogenous grafts may complement arthroscopic reconstruction by allowing further reduction in surgical morbidity. In this article we have expanded on some of the advantages of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction, given an overview of arthroscopic techniques, and described the techniques we prefer.\r"

Arthroscopy of the unstable ankle in which there is significant pain without demonstrable intra-articular injury by bone scans, CT scans, and MRI studies is indicated, as intra-articular lesions do occur that may result in chronic pain after the ankle has been rendered stable. An arthroscopic lateral ankle capsulodesis procedure has been described with promising early results. Arthroscopic management of an intra-articular pathologic condition in the stable ankle involves removal or excision of offending bone and/or soft tissue. Patients' symptoms can be improved significantly by these approaches, after which there can be a return to a more normal level of function.\r"

No longer is the womb an isolated, forbidding environment, but it is accessible with such tools as magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, CVS, Doppler, and sound clinical judgement.

There are, however, definite risks reported from the use of aspirin during pregnancy, even though some of the findings have been contradictory. Some of the potential adverse effects on the infant also remain unclear. Potential benefits from the use of low doses of aspirin during pregnancy (although promising) are still experimental. Large clinical trials in the United States and overseas are currently assessing the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia and fetal growth retardation. A review of the world's literature to date describes over 300 pregnancies in which low-dose aspirin has been used with no evidence of major adverse effects. Until more conclusive evidence emerges, however, caution against the indiscriminate use of aspirin in any dose during pregnancy is urged. Clinicians who decide to manage complicated or potentially complicated patients with chronic administration of aspirin must continue to study these mothers, fetuses, and neonates intensively and to document their results. Because of the fear of teratogenic effects in the first trimester, initiation of aspirin therapy should be withheld until the 13th week of gestation. However, current data indicates it can be continued until delivery without complication. Monitoring of these patients should include: warning signs and symptoms of bleeding, serial ultrasonography for fetal growth and fluid, serial fetal echocardiography, and neonatal evaluation for bleeding complications. Such clinical experience will add immensely to our understanding of the safety and efficacy of aspirin during pregnancy.\r"

Although nutritional status can be linked to such things as socioeconomic class and education, it is nutrition directly that exerts a biologic effect. This review has attempted to look at three elements and their relationship to maternal and fetal outcome. At the present time, there does not seem to be a role for routine magnesium supplementation during pregnancy. Magnesium deficiency, as an isolated nutritional deficiency, is rare, and the evidence is, at best, weak that magnesium supplementation reduces the risk of poor perinatal outcome. Zinc deficiency is also a very rare isolated nutritional finding. Our ability to measure zinc accurately, be it in leukocytes or serum, is improving, but the routine use of zinc supplements during pregnancy cannot be recommended at this time. It may be that zinc will be a useful diagnostic marker, rather than a therapeutic intervention. There is substantial evidence that the average American diet does not contain sufficient calcium. An expansive literature continues to grow in the areas of calcium and colon cancer, calcium and breast cancer, calcium and hypertension, and calcium and osteoporosis. Is it possible that our susceptibilities to these problems begin in utero? Obviously, the answer is unknown. What is known is that supplemental calcium to some degree is needed in the diets of most Americans and in about two thirds of pregnant women. Calcium supplementation seems to affect blood pressure favorably and, pending confirmation with larger trials, may significantly reduce prematurity and preeclampsia risk, thus improving perinatal outcome for a large number of our high-risk patients.\r"

If the prevention of macrosomia is desired, the use of prophylactic insulin, initiated as early as possible, but at the latest before 36 weeks' gestation, without regard to glycemia is effective. Alternatively, glucose self-monitoring (four to six times daily with institution of insulin treatment when fasting glucose exceeds some arbitrary threshold such as 90 mg/dl or postprandial values exceed a threshold such as 100 mg/dl) is likely to be equally effective with fewer patients requiring insulin injections.\r"

The fetal prognosis may change if the dysrhythmia persists or if the condition results in intrauterine heart failure. When either complication is evident, intrauterine drug therapy may be indicated if the fetus is considered too immature for delivery. Information from case reports has shown several drugs to be useful to cardiovert the fetus, with digitalis being the pharmacologic agent used most often. At present, treatment consists mainly of transplacental administration of antiarrhythmic agents with the object of normalizing FHR and rhythm and abolishing, or preventing, fetal cardiac failure. Various agents have been used with variable success. More direct fetal therapy by intramuscular injection or umbilical vein infusion may replace unsuccessful indirect maternal therapy. It is unclear why some fetuses respond (or appear to respond) and others have hydrops and die in the absence of congenital heart disease or documented infection. With proper therapy, many fetuses survive and have a satisfactory prognosis, depending on the form of arrhythmia and the nature of any cardiac structural defects.\r"

Initial evaluation should include glucose tolerance testing and a thorough search for fetal abnormalities by ultrasonography. In the patient with symptoms such as premature labor or respiratory compromise, an initial amniocentesis should be considered for decompression and fetal karotype. Oral indomethacin therapy can then be started. Although the optimal dose is unknown, a 25-mg oral dose every 6 hours appears adequate. Ultrasound assessment of amniotic fluid volume should be done once or twice weekly. If oligohydramnios develops, the indomethacin should be discontinued, and the amniotic fluid volume serially monitored. Fetal echocardiography should be considered in the first 24 hours after therapy has been initiated and weekly thereafter. Evidence of severe constriction of the ductus arteriosus or tricuspid regurgitation warrants discontinuation of the indomethacin; lesser degrees of ductal constriction can be treated by decreasing the dose of the medication.\r"

Because neonatal RDS is the most common and the most severe complication of a preterm delivery, a major emphasis has been placed on its prevention and/or treatment. Despite intensive research efforts directed at preventing or inhibiting preterm labor, to date there is no universally effective method that can be used in most patients. As a result, preterm birth will continue to occur and continue to challenge the health care provider. Several medications and hormones have been shown to stimulate endogenous surfactant production in the fetus. Their administration to women at risk of delivering preterm can decrease both the incidence and severity of neonatal RDS. The primary limiting factor with most agents is the need to delay birth for 48 to 72 hours to achieve maximum therapeutic effect. This mandates the obstetric health care provider not only identify parturients who will deliver preterm but also manage their intrapartum course to achieve maximum value from these pharmacologic agents. Lastly, in those patients in whom labor can be neither inhibited nor safely delayed, exogenous surfactant therapy offers real hope particularly to the very low birth weight baby. To obtain maximum benefit in the very premature infant, i.e., less than 30 weeks' gestation, therapy ideally should begin immediately after birth and before the first breath. However, to offer such therapy, patients need to be identified during the intrapartum period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Attempts to reduce this complication require an understanding of its pathogenesis. In this chapter a model was proposed, consisting of a series of events resulting in rapid changes of cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure and leading to rupture of the unique fragile vessels of the germinal matrix and intraventricular regions. Understanding the beneficial physiologic changes induced by such agents such as phenobarbital and vitamin K and that such pharmacologic therapy must be started during the antenatal period has resulted in significant reductions of severe grades of IVH. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results using these two drugs alone and in combination. Other potentially beneficial drugs such as indomethacin should be investigated. Although the benefits of such therapy may improve perinatal outcome, the emphasis in our discipline should be the continued attempt to prevent the delivery of these VLBW infants.\r"

Early antibiotic therapy should reduce the risk of congenital syphilis and any perinatal hazards associated with chlamydial and gonococcal infections.\r"

Although there is no unanimity of opinion regarding the most efficacious antibiotic regimen for the treatment of this complication, there is a consensus, at least among obstetricians, that maternal treatment may have an impact on neonatal outcome. It appears that the fetus and neonate benefit from \"intrauterine\" treatment. Virtually all antibiotics cross the placenta, and fortunately most are relatively safe for use during pregnancy.\r"

Since laparoscopy is more convenient to the patient, less expensive, saves hospital beds, and involves low morbidity, it should be the preferred surgical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic adhesions whenever possible. The use of a sharp dissection combined with electrocautery seems, at this time, to be equally effective to the use of lasers of different kinds. Adjuvants presently available, especially Hyskon or INTERCEED, have an added benefit to surgery alone. Even with the best surgical technique, adhesions tend to re-form. Although SLL will identify the extent of adhesion re-formation, the therapeutic advantage of lysing re-formed adhesions is yet to be proved.\r"

More sensitive pregnancy tests and high-resolution transvaginal sonography are making the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy easier and earlier. In the future, we may become more confident with the ultrasound diagnosis of some ectopic pregnancies such that laparoscopic confirmation will not be required. These patients may be treated with systemic methotrexate. However, at the present time laparoscopy is essential for diagnostic confirmation of most ectopic pregnancies. It is senseless for a skilled laparoscopist to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy, remove the laparoscope, and then proceed with laparotomy or some nonsurgical treatment. There is sufficient evidence in the literature to demonstrate that laparoscopic management of ectopic pregnancies is equally safe, equally effective, and less traumatic than laparotomy. It should replace laparotomy as treatment for most ectopic pregnancies. Unfortunately, there are not enough trained laparoscopists to manage the 88,000 ectopic pregnancies per year in the United States. Operative laparoscopy deserves more emphasis in postgraduate and residency training programs.\r"

Antipyrine clearance normalized to body weight was significantly greater in children than in adults (0.91 versus 0.59 ml/min/kg; p = 0.012), but was not different when normalized to body surface area. In contrast, lorazepam total clearance (CL) and unbound clearance (CLu) normalized to body weight were not significantly different between children and adults but were smaller in children when normalized to body surface area (CL = 31.9 versus 40.6 ml/min/m2, p = 0.036; CLu = 352 versus 485 ml/min/m2, p = 0.010).

The highly specific binding of the beta-subunit of cholera toxin was used to quantify ganglioside GM1 levels in plasma, urine, and feces. This dose regime increased the ganglioside GM1 steady-state plasma levels two to three orders of magnitude above the endogenous levels of 0.132 mg/L (coefficient of variation, 8.9%). Large and variable amounts of ganglioside GM1 were found in feces before and during treatment without relation to the dosage. No ganglioside GM1 could be detected in urine at any time. Plasma kinetics were linear with a biexponential disposition. Exogenously administered ganglioside GM1 was confined mainly to the blood volume as indicated by a steady-state volume of distribution of 6.98 +/- 3.57 L and appears to be excreted mainly in the form of metabolites. The total clearance was very slow at 1.61 +/- 0.37 ml/min. Absorption after intramuscular administration was slow (time to reach maximum concentration greater than 12 hours) and yielded steady-state concentrations somewhat lower compared with the intravenous infusion.\r"

To explore the pharmacodynamic explanation for this difference, eight Chinese subjects (age range, 25 to 42 years) and eight white subjects (age range, 22 to 36 years) were given single doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg propranolol on separate occasions at least 3 days apart. Heart rate, mean blood pressure, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and plasma renin activity were measured at the end of treadmill exercise 2 hours after medication was administered. Propranolol produced a concentration-dependent reduction in mean blood pressure and heart rate in both groups. Concentration-response curves were shifted significantly to the left in Chinese subjects, confirming the increased sensitivity to propranolol of the Chinese. The baseline exercise plasma renin activity was twofold higher (p less than 0.05) in Chinese than in white subjects. The sensitivity to beta-blockade-induced suppression of plasma renin activity was increased in the Chinese, which resulted in a sevenfold higher concentration being required in white subjects than in Chinese to produce the same 50% suppression of exercise plasma renin activity (84.8 +/- 23.2 versus 12.7 +/- 7.4 ng/ml, p less than 0.05). The reduction in exercise heart rate and mean blood pressure produced by propranolol were well correlated to the reduction in exercise plasma renin activity in both populations. There was no significant effect of either race or propranolol on plasma catecholamine concentration after exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Self-reported and observed measures of tobacco withdrawal, caffeine withdrawal, and intoxication, as well as psychomotor tasks and vital signs, were completed daily; blood was drawn at the end of each period. Temporary abstinence produced typical withdrawal symptoms but did not significantly increase caffeine blood levels. Caffeine did not increase the severity of symptoms but did decrease the severity of withdrawal-induced hunger. These findings suggest that, in the absence of increased blood levels, caffeine does not increase the severity of tobacco withdrawal.\r"

Quinolone administration produced no significant effect on visual (qualitative) reading of the positron emission tomography scans. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that short-term administration of temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or placebo does not significantly alter cerebral glucose or oxygen metabolism. Subjects treated with ciprofloxacin demonstrated a significant decrease in brain blood flow compared with baseline and with temafloxacin- or placebo-treated subjects.\r"

The 10 mg dose caused effects on saccadic eye movements and subjective scores of alertness, whereas 5 mg temazepam was detected only by analysis of saccadic eye movements. Linear relationships between plasma concentrations and effects were found in nine subjects for saccadic peak velocity and eight subjects for subjective scores of alertness.

We used the dorsal hand vein technique to measure the effects of several vasodilators infused locally and to measure the action of systemically administered nifedipine. The venodilatory effects of hydralazine, verapamil, diazoxide, and nitroglycerin were determined in peripheral veins of healthy subjects. The potency (ED50, the dose producing half-maximal response) was as follows: nitroglycerin (0.0007 micrograms/min) greater than verapamil (6.5 micrograms/min) greater than diazoxide (75 micrograms/min) greater than hydralazine (660 micrograms/min). The effect of oral nifedipine on alpha-adrenergic responsiveness of hand veins was determined. Nifedipine given in therapeutic doses for the treatment of hypertension was associated with a threefold increase in the ED50 for phenylephrine (92 to 277 ng/min; p less than 0.05) and norepinephrine (2.9 to 11.5 ng/min; p less than 0.05). Therapeutic doses of nifedipine are associated with measurable shifts in the dose-response curves to these two alpha-adrenergic agonists in the hand vein. The hand vein technique can be used not only to compare the potency of locally infused drugs but also to measure venous effects of vasoactive drugs at therapeutic concentrations achieved after systemic administration.\r"

We successfully used low-dose phenobarbital (a valid pharmacologic indicator) to measure compliance by incorporating the drug into the methadone medication of patients attending an addiction unit. Plasma phenobarbital and methadone concentrations were measured in 20 (11 clinic-based and 9 community-based) patients receiving long-term treatment with the phenobarbital level-to-dose ratio, together with interviews, to validate methadone measurements and to monitor compliance. Patients attending the unit on a daily basis and who consumed their medication in the clinic were substantially more compliant than community-based patients. Laboratory measurements of phenobarbital and methadone helped to identify the use of illicit methadone, as well as incorrect self-administration, such as the consumption of several days' dosage at one time.\r"

For wound problems, 3.8 and 6.9 DDD/100 bed days were given in the hip- and knee-replacement groups. For distant infection, 6.5 DDD/100 bed days was administered in both groups. Duration of therapy varied only in relation to indication. Prescribed were penicillins (43% to 50%), sulfonamides (18%), cephalosporins (10% to 16%), and nitrofurantoin (8% to 13%); drug use was related to the type of infection.\r"

Resting and exercise blood pressure were significantly reduced during enalapril therapy. Heart rate was unaffected. Submaximal endurance exercise performance was reduced by 12% (p = 0.06). Plasma lactate concentrations were significantly increased and serum nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were decreased during exercise in patients receiving enalapril treatment. Plasma glucose and potassium levels and serum glycerol concentrations were not influenced by enalapril treatment. Because the impairment of endurance performance during enalapril treatment is relatively small compared with the reductions caused by other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents or diuretics, it is of minor clinical importance for most physically active patients with hypertension.\r"

The responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from thiuram-sensitive and non-sensitive individuals following culture with dimethylcarbamoyl-protein (human serum albumin; HSA) and dimethylthiocarbamoyl-HSA conjugates has been compared. Only PBMC from those patients who were patch-test-positive with thiuram-mix and sensitized to tetramethylthiuram monosulphide (TMTM) or TMTM and tetramethylthiuram disulphide (TMTD) exhibited significant proliferative responses to these conjugates. Thiuram-patch-test-negative patients and control donors with no history of allergic contact dermatitis failed to mount a significant response to any concentration of either conjugate. Two of the thiuram-sensitive patients were also nickel-patch-test-positive, and PBMC isolated from these donors, but not from nickel-patch-test-negative patients, proved positive in a nickel LTT. The data reveal that relevant hapten-protein conjugates are capable of provoking specific human lymphocyte proliferative responses in vitro, and that, using this technique, the LTT can, in principle, be used for the investigation and/or diagnosis of skin sensitization to lipophilic contact allergens.\r"

Both irritant and allergic responses produced statistically significant increases in laser-Doppler flow index and erythema index compared to control sites (p less than 0.05 or less, using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). A disproportionately greater increase in erythema index than in laser-Doppler flow was seen in mild irritant reactions, compared to allergic, though the two could not be reliably distinguished by these tests. 2 non-allergic nickel sulphate sites produced an increase in both blood flow and erythema without any clinical change. Petrolatum alone produced no significant change in either measurement. The laser-Doppler flow showed an overall correlation with the erythema index (product moment method; r = 0.55, p less than 0.001), but there was little correlation between these indices and patch test reactivity as judged clinically by conventional scoring. Generally, allergic and irritant patch test reactions could not be differentiated on the basis of laser-Doppler flow or erythema index. However, the disproportionate increase in erythema index over laser-Doppler flow index for mild irritant responses warrants further study in other irritant models.\r"

There was a marked preponderance in the young age groups after vaccination, while none of 36 infants (aged 3-48 months) reacted to thimerosal.

We also sensitized guinea pigs with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine containing 0.01% thimerosal and succeeded in inducing hypersensitivity to thimerosal. From patch testing in humans and animal experiments, it is suggested that 0.01% thimerosal in vaccines can sensitize children, and that hypersensitivity to thimerosal is due to the thiosalicylic part of the molecule and correlates with photosensitivity to piroxicam.\r"

The aim of this study was to study the persistence of a specific contact sensitivity in 66 patients with alopecia areata, previously sensitized to DNCB (31 patients) and SADBE (35 patients) between 1978-1985. Patch tests were performed with 0.020 ml of different concentrations of DNCB or SADBE in acetone (0.05%, 0.10%, 0.20%, 1%). The results were read in a standardized manner. Of 66 patients, 47 (71%) had positive reactions and 19 (29%) negative. 8 of the 19 negative patients had been treated with DNCB, 11 with SADBE. Approximately 1/3 of the patients previously sensitized had lost their original sensitivity, and this did not seem to be time-dependent. This phenomenon seemed to be clinically correlated because the majority of the patients were from the \"low responders\" group. We think that acquired unresponsiveness to topical antigen in man is a possible phenomenon, but that it occurs more rarely than in mice and guinea pigs.\r"

The mechanism of the cross-reactions may involve photoproducts of piroxicam and L-cysteine, as patients allergic to thiosalicylic acid, who have positive photopatch tests to piroxicam, also had positive patch tests to the irradiated solution of piroxicam plus L-cysteine.\r"

The distribution and morphology of the lesions were different from the classical form as described in the literature. Repeated open application tests with fresh garlic were all positive and patch tests with garlic extract were all negative. 5 controls tested by repeated open application with fresh garlic juice were also positive and patch tests in 10 controls with garlic extract were also negative. The results confirmed that the contact dermatitis was due to irritation. The patients were treated successfully with topical fluorinated steroid. For prevention, the practice of direct application of fresh garlic onto the skin for treating infections should be discouraged.\r"

The aetiology was established when patch tests with crude moth material produced similar eruptions in 5 out of 7 adult volunteers between 40 min and 12 h. Pharmacological experiments with an aqueous extract of moth hairs in isolated guinea pig ileum elicited a response similar to that induced by histamine.\r"

Ear swelling was then measured using an engineer's micrometer, 2, 24, 48 or 72 h thereafter. Significant differences in ear swelling between control and TBTO-sensitized animals were found 24 h after challenge: thereafter the elicitation reaction declined rapidly whilst irritant swelling in control animals increased. Maximal elicitation of TBTO sensitivity could only be elicited by concentrations of TBTO that caused irritation. In a separate experiment, a single application of TBTO to the ears of naive animals provoked increase in auricular lymph node weight, cell yield and proliferation of lymph node cells during overnight culture. These data support the conclusion that TBTO is a contact sensitizer and illustrate the potential usefulness of the quantitative methods of contact sensitivity assessment which have been developed in the mouse.\r"

Over 60% of cases were reviewed more than 2 years after the original diagnosis was made. More than 50% were still suffering from OSD or consequences related thereto. Clearance was less likely in those who remained in their original, or similar, occupational environment. However, of those who changed their job due to OSD, many suffered aggravation of the dermatitis from factors in the new work environment. Over 10% of cases had evolved into a persistent postoccupational dermatitis without obvious cause. This condition is responsible for considerable impairment and is of medicolegal importance due to confusion as to its relationship to the original occupational factors.\r"

Of these, 16 had clinically been suspected of having a textile dermatitis from among 1145 patients referred for patch testing. 41 patients were identified from among 861 consecutive subjects tested with the GIRDCA (Italian Research Group on Contact and Environmental Dermatitis) standard series supplemented with 4 disperse dyes (Disperse Blue 124, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Yellow 3, Disperse Orange 3). The remaining 43 patients were identified from among 746 subjects tested with the GIRDCA standard series, supplemented with the 4 disperse dyes mentioned above and a further series of 12 other textile dyes. The clinical picture was extremely variable: most patients had a typical eczematous dermatitis, but we also observed persistent erythematous-wheal-type reactions, a transient urticarial dermatitis and an erythema-multiforme-like eruption. Among these textile dyes, Disperse Blue 124 caused most reactions. With the addition of the 4 disperse dyes to the GIRDCA standard series, we identified 4.8% sensitized to textile dyes, a much higher figure than the 1.4% observed among patients being patch tested on the basis of their history and the clinical findings; the addition of a further 12 textile dyes to the series further increased the detection rate to 5.8%. We stress the importance of routinely patch testing with textile dyes, which can help to elucidate the cause of certain kinds of atypical dermatitis.\r"

The lesions spread to covered areas of the skin, suggesting photoallergy clinically. Patch and photopatch testing revealed photoallergy and contact allergy to clomipramine and contact allergy also to carbamazepine. In addition, the patient had positive patch test reactions to chlorpromazine, balsam of Peru and fragrance-mix, as well as a positive photopatch test to fentichlor. UVA and UVB erythema thresholds were normal. In this patient, an initial episode of photosensitization, probably elicited by clomipramine, was accompanied by contact allergy to this drug and to carbamazepine. The contact sensitivity to clomipramine could also be elicited by oral provocation without UV light. Hypothetically, a photoproduct of clomipramine may have been the original sensitizer, this compound subsequently cross-reacting with clomipramine and, possibly with carbamazepine.\r"

This study was performed to evaluate the irritant potential of rockwools of different diameters and to compare the change of blood flow, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry, at different patch test occlusion times with rockwools. Rockwool A (mean diameter 4.20 +/- 1.96 mu) was more irritating than rockwool B (mean diameter 3.20 +/- 1.5 mu). The difference was more clearly observed in a 48-h patch test than in an 8-h or 24-h test. We concluded that laser Doppler blood flow measurement was a useful experimental tool for the evaluation of irritant patch test responses to mechanical irritants like rockwool, and that 48 h or more of occlusion time was necessary to produce irritant patch test responses to certain types of rockwool.\r"

Although 10 sesquiterpene lactones (SL) and 3 polyines have previously been identified, the sensitizers of yarrow have escaped detection. A reinvestigation of short ether extracts of yarrow revealed the presence of 5 unsaturated hitherto unknown guaianolides of peroxide character. The main SL, identified as a strong sensitizer in guinea pig sensitization experiments, was named alpha-peroxyachifolid. The minor SL also contribute marginally to the sensitizing capacity, while other known yarrow constituents like dehydromatricaria ester and pontica epoxide appear to play no role. A 5-year follow-up (1985-1990) of Compositae-sensitive patients showed that more than 50% reacted when tested with a short ether extract of yarrow. Exacerbation of the patch test sites by irradiation with UV light was never observed.\r"

A commercial formulation of CMA (Chevron Ice-B-Gon Deicer) and road salt were tested in a human repeat insult patch test to evaluate the contact hypersensitivity potential of these materials and to evaluate irritation following single or multiple applications. 72 of the initial 82 panelists completed the study. CMA and road salt (each at 10% and 30% w/w in distilled water; 0.3 ml) were administered under occlusive patches on the forearm for 14 h 3 x per week for 3 weeks. The panelists were challenged 2 weeks later; 2 panelists who had mild reactions were subsequently rechallenged 6 weeks later. Neither CMA nor road salt produced contact hypersensitivity in any panelists. Following the first application, moderate acute irritation was observed only at 1 skin site exposed to 30% road salt. Repeated exposure to CMA or road salt produced mild to moderate irritation. The highest incidence of moderate irritation was observed with 30% road salt. Thus, neither material is expected to cause significant dermal effects in exposed workers. CMA is expected to cause dermal irritation equivalent to or less than that caused by road salt.\r"

The patients were negative on patch testing with the standard ER based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA-ER). The following non-DGEBA-ERs were included in the causative agents: heterocyclic dimethylhydantoin ER, phenol novolak ER, and brominated ER. We were unable to specify the type of ER in an epoxy primer used by the 4th patient. Apart from the ACD caused by the brominated ER, 1 of the patients also had IgE-mediated occupational rhinitis caused by methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA), an epoxy hardener. The diagnosis was verified by positive prick tests and specific IgE determinations with MHHPA. Intense rhinitis evoked by a bronchial challenge with MHHPA confirmed the diagnosis. We stress the importance of performing patch testing with the relevant epoxy resins to which the patient has been exposed, in addition to patch testing with the standard ER.\r"

  ".W": "Bleeding from stress erosive gastritis continues to be a potential problem in critically ill and injured patients, but fortunately its incidence has decreased dramatically over the last decade. The explanation for this circumstance is probably multifactorial, but clearly relates to our increased knowledge of its pathophysiology. This understanding has led to the routine use of measures to reduce intragastric acidity (luminal acid being a prerequisite for stress ulcer to occur), coupled with improved techniques for the treatment of shock and the accompanying gastric mucosal hypoperfusion (another prerequisite for the formation of stress ulcers). A number of measures have been used to lower intragastric acidity with H2 receptor blockers emerging as the agents of choice to accomplish this goal. In the unlikely event that bleeding occurs despite these prophylactic measures, aggressive medical management will result in cessation of hemorrhage in over 80% of patients. In those few individuals requiring surgery to control bleeding, no operation has emerged as the recognized procedure of choice. Thus, we believe that a conservative operative approach is indicated in this setting and recommend vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the bleeding erosions as appropriate therapy for most patients requiring surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis or extrinsic allergic alveolitis is an immunologically mediated lung disease caused by repeated inhalations of organic antigens. The basic histologic lesion consists of a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltration of alveolar wall, alveoli, terminal bronchioles, and neighboring interstitium. The inflammation is often followed by granulomas, which then may progress to fibrosis. Although there is no single radiologic, physiologic, or immunologic test specific for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the diagnosis can often be suspected on the basis of a compatible temporal relationship of pulmonary symptoms to the history of environmental or occupational exposure. Once the diagnosis is suspected, the presence of serum precipitating antibodies (IgG), suppressor cytotoxic lymphocytosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and granulomatous alveolitis in lung biopsy specimens are extremely helpful in confirming the diagnosis. In patients where the diagnosis is confirmed, avoidance of the causative antigen is the best therapy, although corticosteroids are used to suppress inflammation. Once the fibrosis is set in, the patient may gradually slide into respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and death.\r"

By this definition, the age-adjusted prevalence per 1,000 population, increased steadily from 2.7 in 1940 to 6.8 in 1980. At each of five prevalence dates, for all prevalence cases, 60% had epilepsy manifest by partial seizures, and 75% had no known etiology. Prevalence was higher for males than females for all except the last prevalence day. After 1950, prevalence tended to increase with advancing age and was highest in the oldest age groups. On the average, the 1980 prevalence cases had epilepsy less than 10 years and greater than 50% had their first diagnosis in the first 20 years of life.\r"

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be an effective noninvasive technique for identifying lesions in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. It has also been suggested that MRI may be sensitive to transient functional or metabolic changes in brain tissue. Increased brain electrical activity as monitored by electroencephalography causes changes in cerebral metabolism that may be responsible for focal or regional alterations in signal in the MRI of some patients. To test this hypotheses, experimental interictal cortical foci were produced in rats by topical application of penicillin to one hemisphere of the brain. In vivo MRI and phosphorous-31 (31P) spectroscopy of the focal and contralateral hemifield were performed in a 30-cm bore 1.89-T Bruker MSL system. 31P spectroscopy revealed no quantifiable differences in pH or in phosphocreatinine and ATP levels between the focal area and the contralateral hemisphere or between experimental and saline-treated control animals. There were also no differences in proton MRI. Similar areas of prolonged T2 were found near the cortex and in the deeper parenchyma in 55% of the experimental animals and 50% of the controls. These results suggest that the electrical activity from an interictal cortical spike focus is not severe enough to perturb cerebral metabolism sufficiently to be detectable by 31P spectroscopy or proton imaging techniques.\r"

We analyzed the MRI examinations of 20 patients with medically refractory CPS who later underwent resection of the seizure focus proven by electroencephalography (EEG). MRI studies were correlated with surgical pathology in all patients. Eleven of the 20 CPS patients had mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Seven of the 11 (64%) exhibited an MRI abnormality at the site of the EEG-demonstrated histopathologic focus. MRI abnormalities included temporal lobe hypoplasia or atrophy (four patients), and increased signal intensity on long repetition time (TR) sequences (three patients). Four patients had no MRI abnormalities corresponding to the histopathologic focus. Nine of the 20 CPS patients had other abnormalities responsible for the seizures, including astrocytoma, cryptic vascular malformation, hamartoma, polymicrogyria, tuberous sclerosis (forme fruste), arachnoid cyst, and congenital hemiatrophy. No patient had normal MRI studies. Our single most useful MRI sequence was the coronal long TR/dual echo sequence, using cardiac gating and first-order gradient moment nulling to diminish flow-related artifacts that could hinder evaluation of medial temporal lobe structures.\r"

Clinically the seizures were stereotyped, with cessation of activity followed by turning of head and body to the right and then by struggling, kicking, and vocalizations indicating fear. Total seizure duration was approximately 30 s, with an apparent abrupt return of consciousness. The interictal scalp EEGs were similar to those of primary generalized epilepsy, with bisynchronous though asymmetric epileptiform activity anteriorly. Ictal scalp recordings were not localizing. Recordings from bilateral frontal and temporal subdural electrodes showed an electrical focus in the right fronto-orbital region which was confirmed by electrocorticography (ECoG) at the time of craniotomy. The right fronto-orbital cortex was resected and on pathologic examination showed gliotic tissue and intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules consistent with lipofuscinosis. The patient has remained seizure-free for 6 years after operation.\r"

Very frequent bilateral focal or generalized discharges are often noted on the sleep EEG records of these patients with no evidence of clinical seizures. The relation between these paroxysms and the observed deterioration remains unclear. We report a child with a partial complex epilepsy and severe disturbances of language, cognition, and behavior acquired in the early years of development who was followed for 15 years. A correlation between the evolution of the striking EEG abnormalities during sleep and the neuropsychological disorders could be established retrospectively. The observed sequence of onset and recovery of the aphasia, the dementia, and the \"psychotic\" behavior makes a direct causal relation between the deficits quite unlikely. Rather it suggests an association of independent symptoms with a specific language disorder becoming manifest in the course of the evolution. This child shows many of the main characteristics of the syndromes of \"acquired aphasia with convulsive disorder\" (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) and \"epilepsy with continuous spike waves during sleep.\" Both syndromes describe probably different facets of a similar underlying, still unexplained cerebral dysfunction.\r"

Infantile spasms, the type of seizures that occurs in patients who have West syndrome, have been well characterized by video-EEG studies and typically occur as a series of sudden generalized flexor or extensor jerks. The seizure types that occur in LGS have not been as clearly delineated. Some patients with West syndrome (WS) in early infancy later develop LGS. Using intensive video-EEG monitoring, we evaluated 14 LGS patients who had seizures that occurred in series. Clinically, the seizures greatly resembled infantile spasms, and the ictal EEG changes were identical to those that occur with infantile spasms. These findings expand the number of features known to be shared by these two syndromes and strengthen the hypothesis that the two syndromes represent age-related manifestations of similar epileptogenic processes.\r"

Maternal acute respiratory infection during the first trimester of pregnancy was slightly more frequent in children with FS (odds ratio, 1.9 confidence interval 1.0-3.9). None of the other examined pregnancy or delivery factors was associated with an increased risk, suggesting that birth history is not an important factor predisposing to FS.\r"

This study examined familial aggregation of epilepsy in relation to two measures of severity: duration and remission. The study population comprised 358 offspring born in Rochester, MN, U.S.A., to parents with epilepsy who were diagnosed in Rochester between 1935 and 1979 and followed for greater than or equal to 5 years after the first seizure. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the effects of duration of the parent's epilepsy (less than 5 vs. greater than or equal to 5 years) and remission of the parent's epilepsy (greater than or equal to 5 years seizure-free) on risk of unprovoked seizures in offspring. The univariate rate ratio (RR) for parent's duration (long vs. short) was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.32-3.57). The RR for parent's remission was 2.5 (0.55-11.41), reflecting a higher risk for offspring of remitting parents, which was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis was used to control for three other parental attributes associated with offspring seizure risk: sex, age at onset of seizures (less than 20 vs. greater than or equal to 20 years), and seizure type (absence vs. other). The RR for duration was not substantially changed in this analysis (1.2; 0.37-4.16). However, the RR for remission dropped to 1.2 (0.25-5.97), suggesting that the higher risk in offspring of remitting parents was largely explained by confounding with other factors that influence offspring seizure risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The novel design included a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase that minimized the number of patients receiving placebo and allowed determination of the optimum dose of GVG for each patient before initiation of the double-blind phase. The study was divided into four phases. The first phase was a 6-week period of baseline observation. In the second phase, GVG was added openly to previous AEDs for 8 weeks. During the first 2 weeks of this phase, the dose of GVG was increased weekly and then, in the absence of adverse effects, was held constant for the next 6 weeks. At the end of this open phase, seizure frequency during the 6 weeks of constant treatment was compared with the baseline seizure frequency for each patient. Patients who experienced reduction greater than 50% in the frequency of any seizure type during the open phase were defined as responders. These responders were then entered into the third and double-blind phase, in which they were randomly allocated wither to continue active GVG treatment or placebo for 8 weeks. Thirty-three patients entered the study; 31 of 33 patients completed the initial open phase. Twenty patients achieved a reduction greater than or equal to 50% in the frequency of one or more seizure types and were eligible for the double-blind phase; 10 were randomized to continue GVG and 10 were randomized to placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Reproductive and sexual dysfunction in men with epilepsy has been attributed to androgen deficiency. Low serum free testosterone (FT) levels occur in both hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been implicated. Proposed mechanisms include induction of increased sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) resulting in decreased FT, as well as dysfunction or premature aging of the hypothalamopituitary-gonadal axis. In an investigation comparing serum reproductive steroid levels among 20 men receiving phenytoin (PHT) monotherapy for complex partial seizures, 21 untreated men with complex partial seizures, and 20 age-matched normal controls, total estradiol levels were significantly higher in the PHT group (56.3 +/- 29.4 pg/ml, mean +/- SD) than in the untreated (32.4 +/- 27.4 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and normal control (34.3 +/- 12.7 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) groups. The physiologically active non-SHBG-bound serum estradiol levels were also significantly higher in the medicated group (45.1 +/- 21.7 pg/ml) than in the untreated (29.9 +/- 17.2 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and normal control (31.1 +/- 11.4 pg/ml, p = 0.05) groups. These findings suggest that PHT may lower FT by induction of aromatase, enhancing FT conversion to estradiol, as well as SHBG synthetase. Estradiol exerts a potent inhibitory influence on luteinizing hormone secretion and has been suggested to play a major role in negative feedback in men as well as women. Suppression of LH secretion results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Chronically low FT leads to testicular failure and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Finally, estradiol has been shown to produce premature aging of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, which secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Optimal management of allergic rash from antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is unclear. We identified 50 patients with 68 reactions (36 to one AED, 10 to two AEDs, and four to three AEDs). The AEDs implicated were carbamazepine, 30; phenobarbital (PB), 20; phenytoin, 16; ethosuximide, one; and AED combination, one. Sixty-three reactions were cutaneous eruptions, three exfoliative dermatitis, and two Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Forty-six reactions were mild (rash only), 18 moderate (systemic symptoms or other organ system involvement), and four life-threatening (all with PB). In most patients with greater than 1 reaction, the second and third reactions were not more severe than the first. Prior antibiotic allergies or nonmedication allergies were no more common than in a control group without reactions. The AED was ceased abruptly in 59 patients (22 of whom did not receive a new AED), tapered in five, and continued unchanged in four. Despite this, there was no status epilepticus (SE) during the reaction or its treatment, and no patient's seizure control deteriorated. In 40 cases, a new AED was added--16 after the reaction had resolved and 24 before total resolution. Rash recurred with the new AED in 50 and 42% respectively (NS). We conclude that, though allergic rashes to AEDs are usually mild, the rare occurrence of severe reactions indicates that the AED should be ceased. This can be done abruptly with minimal risk of SE. A new AED can be added, if necessary, prior to the resolution of the rash without increasing the risk of further reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Ralitoline (RLT) is a new thiazolidinone derivative with potent anticonvulsant activity in different seizure models. During Phase I studies, RLT was well tolerated in human volunteers and showed linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range tested (up to 150 mg). Since RLT will soon be entering clinical Phase II studies, we were interested in obtaining predictive data for effective plasma concentrations in patients. For this purpose, the anticonvulsant potency of RLT was determined in four seizure models in mice, and plasma levels were measured at time of peak drug effect. The four models were the threshold for maximal (tonic extension) electroshock seizures (MES), the threshold for clonic seizures determined by i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), the traditional MES test with supramaximal (50 mA) stimulation, and generalized clonic seizures induced by s.c. administration of PTZ. Furthermore, median minimal \"neurotoxic\" doses (TD50s) were determined by the rotorod and chimney test for calculation of protective indices. All data obtained for RLT were compared with data obtained with standard antiepileptic drugs: phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate, and diazepam. The onset of anticonvulsant action after i.p. injection of RLT was very rapid, and the peak drug effect was already obtained after 2 min. In the MES models, RLT was the most potent compound. \"Active\" plasma levels ranged from approximately 300 ng/ml in the MES threshold test to approximately 1,300 ng/ml in the MES test. RLT was also capable of increasing the PTZ threshold, whereas, possibly because of its short duration of action in mice, it was not very active in the s.c. PTZ seizure test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

ED50 values were calculated and compared with TD50 values for minimal motor impairment to provide protective indexes (PI = TD50/ED50). The anticonvulsant profiles of SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A were similar and suggest that these compounds raise the threshold for seizure initiation rather than inhibit seizure spread. Like intraperitoneal (i.p.) PHT, CBZ, VPA, and CZP, SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A inhibited seizures in corneally kindled rats. The profiles of SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A were most similar to that of CZP and virtually opposite to that of PHT. Intraperitoneal SK&F 100330-A provided complete protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures [subcutaneous (s.c.) PTZ] in mice but was ineffective against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) at doses slightly greater than its TD50. SK&F 100330-A provided complete protection against picrotoxin-induced seizures (s.c. Pic) and against both clonus and forelimb tonic extension induced by NMDA N-methyl-D-aspartate [intracerebral ventricular (i.c.v.)-NMDA] in mice; however, SK&F 100330-A was ineffective against seizures induced by bicuculline (s.c.

  ".W": "Two novel N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid CPG 37849 and the corresponding 1-ethyl ester CGP 39551, were tested as anticonvulsants in DBA/2 mice and photosensitive Senegalese baboons, Papio papio. In DBA/2 mice, CGP 37849 is more potent than CGP 39551 when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) (ED50 for suppression of clonic seizures at 60 min: i.c.v. 0.038 and 0.21 nmol; i.p. 3.40 and 19.1 mumol/kg, respectively). When administered orally in mice, the two compounds are approximately equipotent (ED50 CGP 37849, 35.2 mumol/kg; ED50 CGP 39551, 28.1 mumol/kg). The time course of action of CGP 39551 is exceptionally prolonged: 42 mumol/kg i.p. protects against clonic seizures for 48 h. Protection provided by other NMDA antagonists in mice is of much shorter duration: 2-amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (AP5) 1 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid (AP7) 4 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid 1-ethyl ester 3 h, 4-(3-phosphonopropyl)-2-piperazine carboxylic acid (CPP) 2 h, cis-4-(phosphonomethyl)-2-piperidine-carboxylic acid (CGS 19755) 4 h, and CGP 37849 4 h. After oral administration of the drugs, the therapeutic index (TI = ratio of the ED50 values for rotorod performance and anticonvulsant protection) remains relatively constant at 5.9-7.2 for 3 h (CGP 37849) and 4.0-6.1 for 24 h (CGP 39551). After i.p. administration, the TI values are CGP 37849 at 1 h 2.4, and at 3 h 20.0, CGP 39551 at 1 h 2.3, at 3 h 7.1, and at 24 h 3.6. In baboons, acute administration of CGP 37849 at doses of 48-191 mumol/kg intravenously (i.v.) suppresses photically induced myoclonus for at least 285 min, with severe side effects at the highest dose tested. CGP 39551 at doses of 169-675 mumol/kg i.v. shows weak anticonvulsant activity only at the highest dose tested (accompanied by severe side effects). CGP 37849 at 48-96 mumol/kg orally (p.o.) fails to protect against photically induced myoclonus up to 4 h after administration, but 191 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces complete suppression of seizures after 24 h. On the other hand, CGP 39551 at 169 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces total suppression of seizure activity at 4 h with a longer duration of anticonvulsant action (2-3 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The eruptions in this group are not atopic by strict criteria but have atopic features and are without a determinable exogenous cause. Histologic features resemble papular urticaria, but there is no history to suggest arthropod bites. Patients with this type of eruption have features similar to those with subacute prurigo, and they respond to variable combinations of topical or systemic corticosteroids, systemic antihistamines, and UVB or UVA. We suggest that the designation of subacute prurigo might be more appropriate for patients with these findings.\r"

The time of onset of the primary tumor ranged from childhood to 71 years. Eleven patients had previous treatment for basal cell carcinoma; two patients had received x-ray radiation to the face for teenage acne. The locations of the primary basal cell carcinomas were the face (n = 10), back (n = 1), and arm (n = 1). The primary tumors ranged from 3.6 x 3.0 to 20.0 x 7.0 cm. The interval from onset to the first sign of metastases ranged from 7 to 34 years. In all cases, the primary tumor was histologically identical to the metastatic lesion. Perineural extension of the basal cell carcinoma in the primary lesion was found in five cases. Regional lymph nodes were the most frequent site of metastasis. Treatment consisted of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Only two patients survived more than 5 years after surgical treatment. One patient has survived 25 years and is still alive.\r"

  ".W": "Skin absorption of benzoyl peroxide from a topical lotion containing freely dispersed drug was compared with that from the same lotion in which the drug was entrapped in a controlled-release styrene-divinylbenzene polymer system. In an in vitro diffusion system, statistically significant (p = 0.01) differences were found in the content of benzoyl peroxide in excised human skin and in percutaneous absorption. In vivo, significantly (p = 0.002) less benzoyl peroxide was absorbed through rhesus monkey skin from the polymeric system. This controlled release of benzoyl peroxide to skin can alter the dose relation that exists between efficacy and skin irritation. Corresponding studies showed reduced skin irritation in cumulative irritancy studies in rabbits and human beings, whereas in vivo human antimicrobial efficacy studies showed that application of the formulations containing entrapped benzoyl peroxide significantly reduced counts of Propionibacterium acnes (p less than 0.001) and aerobic bacteria (p less than 0.001) and the free fatty acid/triglyceride ratio in skin lipids. These findings support the hypothesis that, at least for this drug, controlled topical delivery can enhance safety without sacrificing efficacy.\r"

There has been some debate about the pathogenesis of these calcium deposits. This debate centers on the question of whether the calcium deposition is truly idiopathic or whether it occurs as a result of preexisting epidermal cysts. We have performed immunohistochemical staining for keratin in nine patients with apparent idiopathic scrotal calcinosis and have found no evidence of keratin in the dermal tissue immediately adjacent to the calcium deposits. We conclude that idiopathic scrotal calcinosis is idiopathic.\r"

Histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens of the lesions confirmed the absence of basal cell carcinoma in all cases 4 weeks after completion of therapy. A dense mononuclear cell infiltrate and numerous ectatic blood vessels were present in the dermis at the sites of previous basal cell carcinoma. Immunohistologic analysis of the dermal infiltrate revealed a marked increase of Leu-4+ T cells with a slight predominance of Leu-3+ helper/inducer T cells over Leu-2+ suppressor/cytotoxic T cells. Most of the dermal infiltrate expressed HLA-DR antigen. In addition, Leu-11+ natural killer cells were observed in the dermal infiltrate. Immunohistologic changes in the skin lesions at the sites of previous basal cell carcinoma suggest that intralesional interferon alfa-2b acts on tumor cells by enhancement of local T-cell-mediated immune responses.\r"

Comparable numbers for the vehicle-treated group were 13.4 to 11.1 actinic keratoses and 4.3% median percent reduction. Irritation, as manifested by erythema or flaking, occurred in 61.5% of topical masoprocol-treated patients versus 26.7% of those treated with vehicle and did not correlate with clinical response. Topical masoprocol appears to be useful in the treatment of actinic keratoses.\r"

The syndrome is thought to represent an error in the morphogenesis of the embryonal neuroectoderm. We review 39 reported cases of neurocutaneous melanosis and propose revised criteria for diagnosis. Most patients with neurocutaneous melanosis presented in the first 2 years of life with neurologic manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, or spinal cord compression. Leptomeningeal melanoma was present in 62% of the cases, but even in the absence of melanoma, symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis had an extremely poor prognosis. Useful diagnostic procedures include cerebrospinal fluid cytology and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast. Patients may be aided by palliative measures such as shunt placement to reduce intracranial pressure. Dermatologists in their follow-up of patients with large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi should be aware of this condition, to aid in prompt diagnosis and because the treatment of cutaneous lesions may be altered in the presence of symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis.\r"

Dermatologic surgeons were more likely to injure their dominant fingers. Attitudes of dermatologic surgeons were surveyed regarding operating on patients while the physician or assistant was actively infected with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, herpetic whitlow, or paronychia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Dermatologic surgeons believed that they should be allowed to operate while infected with human immunodeficiency virus (41.5%), hepatitis B virus (40%), herpetic whitlow (25%), and paronychia caused by S. aureus (20%). Few dermatologic surgeons would disclose preoperatively to patients infections present in themselves or in operating team members that were due to human immunodeficiency virus (29.4%), hepatitis B virus (27.8%), herpetic whitlow (28.6%), or paronychia caused by S. aureus (33.3%).\r"

  ".W": "Solar radiation provokes a lifelong series of destructive changes in the supporting elastic tissues of \"exposed\" skin. Called actinic elastosis/lysis (or actinic \"aging\"), the sequence begins in early life as simple elastic hyperplasia, converts in middle life to progressive actinic elastotic degeneration, and, in late life, typically ends with a stage of resorption (elastolysis) and atrophy (\"aged\" skin). Superficial \"exposed\" arteries such as the temporal artery participate in the same sequence of degenerative elastotic changes, which, as in the skin, may provoke granulomatous responses in a few of the many subjects affected. In the case of the temporal artery, a contingent outcome may be giant cell (temporal) arteritis and its recognized systemic vascular expression, polymyalgia rheumatica. Actinic commotion at the surface of the body is often massive in degree and extent and may be expected to exert a deleterious autoimmune impact on the essential elastic tissues of the arterial system. For this reason, solar radiation should be recognized as a risk factor for other elastic-related vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and aneurysms. Man-made radiations may be exacerbating the effects of predominant solar radiation. Of the many radiant bands that make up the actinic (electromagnetic) spectrum, little is known for certain about the identity of those that cause these prevalent disorders of elastic tissue. Until this void is filled, more care should be taken with solar and the other \"safe\" radiations.\r"

  ".W": "Cryosurgery was used to treat 3540 new basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin from 1971 to 1989; a cure rate of 98.4% was achieved. To determine the 5-year cure rate in more recent years, the results of treatment of 684 nonmelanotic skin cancers from 1980 to 1984 were reviewed. In the group of 628 basal cell carcinomas, the 5-year cure rate was 99.0%. In the group of 52 squamous cell carcinomas, the 5-year cure rate was 96.1%. In the series were also four patients with basosquamous cell carcinomas, all of whom were recurrence free for 5 years or more. The overall 5-year cure rate in the 684 cases was 98.8%. On the basis of these data and our cosmetic results, we conclude that cryosurgery is an effective treatment that compares favorably with other established methods of therapy.\r"

Via binding to specific receptors on target cells they regulate the activation, differentiation, and proliferation of immune and nonimmune cells. After injury keratinocytes synthesize and release cytokines such as interleukins, colony stimulating factors, and growth factors. In addition, a network of interacting cytokines appears to be crucial to maintain proper balance. Dysregulation may contribute to certain diseases, particularly those of infectious and autoimmune origin. Therefore many of these mediators appear to be promising candidates to treat infectious and malignant diseases. This article briefly discusses the most important cytokines. Newly developed regimens with cytokines to treat cutaneous disorders will be reviewed.\r"

The stratum lucidum in black skin is not altered by sunlight exposure. The epidermis of black skin rarely shows atrophied areas. The elaunin and oxytalan fibers in black skin are not disposed in candelabra-like formations. Black skin has minimal elastosis and elastic fibers stain pink or red with the hematoxylin and Lee procedure; none stain lilac or blue. The dermis of black skin contains many more fiber fragments composed of collagen fibrils and glycoproteins. Fibroblasts are more numerous, larger, have more biosynthetic organelles than white skin, and are often binucleated and multinucleated. The dermis of black skin has many binucleated and multinucleated macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Black skin has many more mixed apocrine-eccrine sweat glands than does white skin and more blood and lymphatic vessels.\r"

CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes and CD4/CD8 ratio were in the normal range in all patients, and mean values of the entire group were similar to a control group. However, CD8 was in the upper limits of the normal range in some patients with diffuse cutaneous or systemic involvement. This factor led to a significantly decreased CD4/CD8 ratio in that group as compared with the group of patients with the disease limited to the lower extremities. Mean values of natural killer cell activity in three effector/target cell ratios were significantly decreased in 13 of the patients with Kaposi's sarcoma with lesions limited to the lower extremities and in all of the patients with normal T-cell subsets and CD4/CD8 ratios.\r"

Although some patients can be distinguished by their pattern of circulating IgG anti-basement membrane zone antibody binding to 1 mol/L sodium chloride-split human skin, approximately 20% and 50% of bullous pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita patients, respectively, do not possess such antibodies. Hence this study sought to determine whether these patients can be distinguished by mapping the distribution of basement membrane zone immunoreactants in patient skin split in vitro by 1 mol/L sodium chloride. All sodium chloride-treated samples from patients with bullous pemphigoid (n = 8), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (n = 4), or other bullous skin diseases (n = 6) contained a lamina lucida cleavage plane bounded by bullous pemphigoid antigen and laminin; moreover, treatment of patient samples was performed without loss of tissue substrate or in situ immunoreactants. Deposits of IgG were found on the epidermal side of sodium chloride-treated skin from 13 of 14 bullous pemphigoid samples; IgG deposits in bullous pemphigoid samples were exclusively epidermal in eight, epidermal and dermal in five, and solely dermal in one. In contrast, IgG was found exclusively on the dermal side of sodium chloride-treated samples from patients with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Although IgG mapping distinguished bullous pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita patients in 94% of these samples, the distribution of C3 in sodium chloride-treated patient skin was more variable and less predictive diagnostically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although rare, some patients also have circulating low-titer, anti-basement membrane zone autoantibodies. In this study, we report 11 patients with the clinical, histologic, and immunologic criteria for cicatricial pemphigoid who had circulating anti-BMZ autoantibodies as demonstrated by positive indirect staining of a normal human skin that had been fractured through the dermoepidermal junction by prolonged incubation in a cold, 1 mol/L sodium chloride solution. On this salt-split human skin substrate, 9 of the 11 patients (82%) had autoantibodies that bound to the epidermal roof, one serum stained only the dermal floor, and one serum stained both sides of the separation. The predominant class of immunoglobulin in the patients' sera that bound to the substrate was IgA; IgA was the single immunoglobulin in 55% and was associated with IgG in 18%. IgG was the only immunoglobulin detected in 27% of the cases. No specific protein was detected by either Western immunoblot or a new IgA immunoprecipitation procedure.\r"

All six patients had Gottron's paules, periungual erythema/telangiectasia, and violaceous discoloration of the face, neck, upper chest, and back at some time during the course of their disease. In addition, all complained of pruritus and photosensitivity. None of the patients had evidence of malignancy. Each of five patients treated with oral corticosteroids for their cutaneous disease had marked improvement and did not develop myositis. These cases further emphasize that the cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis are pathognomonic of this disease and challenge the commonly held notion that muscle disease always develops within 2 years of onset of skin disease.\r"

Thirty-three patients (21 adults and 12 children or adolescents) with ichthyoses, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, or Darier's disease were treated for a period of 4 months. Most patients showed marked improvement or remission. The results obtained in congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, lamellar ichthyosis, and Papillon-Lefevre syndrome were judged as better than those usually reported with etretinate. The side effects observed in our patients were similar to those reported with etretinate, with the exception of scaling of palms and soles, which had an incidence and severity greater than expected with etretinate. The optimal acitretin dosage providing the best efficacy with minimal undesirable effects varied from patient to patient. The mean daily dose (+/- SD) was 27 +/- 11 mg in adults and 0.7 +/- 0.2 mg/kg in children or adolescents.\r"

  ".W": "Cicatricial pemphigoid is a subepidermal blistering disease that involves the mucous membranes and the skin. The oral cavity and the eye are most frequently involved. The clinical course is of long duration, and often there is significant scarring that can have devastating sequelae. The majority of the patients are elderly. The disease is characterized by the in vivo deposition of an anti-basement membrane zone antibody. The anti-basement membrane zone antibody cannot be detected in the circulation by routine laboratory techniques. The pathogenesis is poorly understood, and the cause is not known. Cicatricial pemphigoid may remain localized to the oral cavity or the eye or the skin (Brunsting-Perry variety), or it may be generalized. It rarely occurs in children, and it may be drug induced. Efforts must be made to differentiate cicatricial pemphigoid from bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, linear IgA bullous disease, and other vesiculobullous disease. Early recognition and treatment can improve the prognosis and avoid surgical intervention. Topical therapy is beneficial and expedites healing. Intralesional corticosteroids are effective and can help reduce the dose of systemic steroids. Most patients require systemic corticosteroid therapy. Dapsone is also useful in treating cicatricial pemphigoid, especially in patients in whom systemic steroids are ineffective or in whom they have to be discontinued because of side effects. Immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine or cyclosphosphamide) are indicated in patients with progressive disease. Occasionally both drugs may be needed.\r"

Acute attacks are life threatening and cannot be managed by antihistamines, corticosteroids, or adrenergic drugs. Prophylactic therapy is possible with danazol or stanozolol. Acquired angioedema includes nonhereditary C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency; idiopathic, allergic, and drug-induced forms; angioedema associated with lupus erythematosus and hypereosinophilia; and angioedema caused by physical stimuli. Treatment of these forms of angioedema depends on identifying and avoiding the cause, induction of tolerance, or symptomatic treatment with systemic antihistamines.\r"

Whether and when to perform a screening workup or a more extensive workup depend on the degree of suspicion that the patient is ill, the urgency with which the patient presses for an answer, and the presence or absence of signs or symptoms that might lead the physician to pursue a diagnosis other than chronic idiopathic urticaria. Angioedema may occur with urticaria, and when it does, the prognosis is worse. Whereas urticaria manifests as circumscribed edema involving the superficial dermis, angioedema involves primarily the deep dermis or subcutaneous or deeper layers. Individual urticarial lesions usually disappear within 2 to 4 hours, whereas those of angioedema can persist for 72 hours. The workup for patients with chronic angioedema can be similar to that for patients with urticaria. However, several additional diagnostic possibilities should be pursued in patients with angioedema, such as hereditary angioedema caused by C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency, because anabolic steroids are effective in the treatment of these conditions.\r"

Mast cells containing chymase and tryptase (MCTC) and tryptase alone (MCT) are two distinct types distinguished on the basis of the neutral protease composition of their granules. MCT cells are distributed primarily in the lung and gastrointestinal mucosa, whereas MCTC cells lie primarily in skin and gastrointestinal submucosa. The appearance of MCT cells in intestinal tissue is T-lymphocyte dependent, whereas MCTC cells is not. The granules in unstimulated mature MCT cells typically contain complete scrolls, whereas those of MCTC cells often contain grating or lattice substructures. Major categories for the mediators of mast cells include performed mediators present in the secretory granule, newly generated lipid-derived mediators, and cytokines.\r"

The overall restenosis rate was 39.6%. The strongest univariate relations to the restenosis rate were found for lesion location (saphenous vein graft, 68%; left anterior descending artery, 45%; left circumflex artery and right coronary artery, 32%; p = 0.002); lesion length (less than or equal to 4.6 mm, 33%; greater than 4.6 mm, 45%; p = 0.001); percent stenosis before angioplasty (less than or equal to 73%, 25%; greater than 73%, 43%; p = 0.005), percent stenosis after angioplasty (less than or equal to 21%, 33%; greater than 21%, 46%; p = 0.017) and arterial diameter (less than 2.9 mm, 44%; greater than or equal to 2.9 mm, 34%; p = 0.036). Two multivariate models to predict restenosis probability were developed with use of stepwise logistic regression. The preprocedural model, which included only variables whose values were known before angioplasty, entered lesion length, vein graft location, left anterior descending artery location, percent stenosis before angioplasty, eccentric lesion and arterial diameter. The postprocedural model, which also included variables whose values were known after angioplasty was performed, was similar to the preangioplasty model except that it also entered postangioplasty percent stenosis and \"optimal\" balloon sizing but did not enter eccentric lesion. These data indicate that the probability of restenosis after angioplasty is determined predominantly by the characteristics of the lesion being dilated. They are consistent with the known intimal proliferative mechanism of restenosis, offer a means of identifying lesions at unusually high or low risk of restenosis, and of predicting the likelihood that a particular lesion will restenose after angioplasty and provide a rationale for stratification by restenosis probability in the design of future studies of restenosis.\r"

The incidence of prior angina, hypertension and heart failure (only 3% of patients less than 55 years of age had a history of heart failure compared with 24% greater than or equal to 75 years old) was found to increase with age. Twenty-nine percent of patients less than 75 years of age were treated with a systemic thrombolytic drug compared with only 5% of patients older than 75 years. Mortality rates increased strikingly with advanced age (less than 2% in patients less than or equal to 55, 4.6% in those 55 to 64, 12.3% in those 65 to 74 and 17.8% in those greater than or equal to 75 years). Both the incidence of complicating illness and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) increased with age. In a multivariate analysis of outcome in older patients (greater than or equal to 65 years), adverse events were related to both prior history of heart failure (odds ratio 3.9) and increasing age (odds ratio 1.4 per each decade of age). Outcome was not improved by treatment with thrombolytic drugs, but these agents were prescribed to only 12% of patients greater than 65 years of age, thereby reducing the power for detecting such an effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Surgery was performed within 7 days of admission in 56% of patients and was done urgently because of hemodynamic deterioration in 108 (53%). All vegetations were identified by echocardiography and confirmed macroscopically at surgery. One hundred ten patients had isolated aortic valve infection, 50 had isolated mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05 for aortic vs. mitral) and 43 had double-valve infection. Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 57, 38 and 67 min, respectively. Sixty-four patients (32%) had extensive infection involving the anulus or adjacent tissues, or both; such infection more frequently involved the aortic than the mitral valve (p less than 0.05). Thirty-eight patients (35%) with aortic valve infection had abscess formation compared with 1 patient (2%) with mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05). Only eight patients (4%) died in the hospital. There were seven patients (3%) with a periprosthetic leak and five patients (3%) with early prosthetic valve endocarditis. Long-term follow-up, available in 174 hospital survivors (89%), revealed 10 deaths and two new ring leaks at 38 +/- 22 months. In conclusion, among patients with endocarditis who need surgery for heart failure, aortic valve infection is more prevalent than mitral valve infection and is more often associated with extensive infection, including abscess formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "After successful thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia and infarction may occur with little warning. Coronary lesion morphology was analyzed from angiograms performed in 72 consecutive patients at 1 to 8 days after streptokinase treatment for acute myocardial infarction and the data were evaluated in relation to the subsequent clinical course. All patients were clinically stable at the time of angiography and continued to receive heparin infusion for greater than or equal to 4 days after thrombolysis. The infarct-related artery was patent in 55 patients (76%). In the 10 days after angiography, 15 patients developed prolonged episodes of angina at rest; the condition of 4 stabilized with medical treatment, but 11 required urgent medical intervention (coronary angioplasty in 8 and bypass surgery in 3). There were no differences in age, gender, left ventricular function or extent of coronary artery disease between those patients who developed unstable angina and those who had a stable in-hospital course. However, the median plaque ulceration index of the infarct-related lesion was 6.7 (95% confidence limits 6.3, 10) in the 15 patients with an unstable course versus 3.3 (2, 4.4) in those with a stable course (p less than 0.001). There were no differences between the two patient groups in the severity of stenosis, length of diseased segment, symmetry/eccentricity, presence of a shoulder, location at branch point or bend, presence of globular or linear filling defects, contrast staining or collateral supply. These data show that after thrombolysis, the degree of irregularity of the infarct-related artery is a critical determinant of early clinical instability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During a follow-up period of 12.8 +/- 1.4 months, 10 patients (9%) had a nonfatal myocardial infarction (n = 8) or died (n = 2) and 22 (20%) were readmitted with recurrent unstable angina. The relation between 20 clinical, ECG and exercise test variables and the risk of adverse outcome (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or recurrent unstable angina) was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate (logistic regression) analysis. Univariate predictors of adverse outcome included diabetes mellitus, evolutionary T wave changes, T wave changes on the preexercise ECG and low maximal rate-pressure product during exercise. Independent predictors of adverse outcome in multivariate analysis included diabetes mellitus, evolutionary T wave changes after admission, rest pain during hospitalization, ST depression during exercise and low maximal rate-pressure product. A predictive model constructed using the regression equation and all independent predictors stratified patients into high and low risk groups (41% and 5% risk of adverse outcome, respectively). The result of a predischarge exercise test adds independent prognostic information to clinical and ECG data in medically treated patients with unstable angina and could be used in combination with clinical and ECG data to identify patients at risk of adverse events.\r"

  ".W": "The value of heart rate variability, ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) variables and the signal-averaged ECG in the prediction of arrhythmic events (sudden death or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias) was assessed before hospital discharge in 416 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the follow-up period (range 1 to 1,112 days), there were 24 arrhythmic events and 47 deaths. The initial relation between several prognostic factors and arrhythmic events was explored with use of the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of survival function. Impaired heart rate variability less than 20 ms (p less than 0.0000), late potentials (p less than 0.0000), ventricular ectopic beat frequency (p less than 0.0000), repetitive ventricular forms (p less than 0.0000), left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% (p less than 0.02) and Killip class (p less than 0.02) were identified as significant univariate predictors of arrhythmic events. When these variables were analyzed by using a stepwise Cox regression model, only impaired heart rate variability, followed by late potentials and repetitive ventricular forms remained independent predictors of arrhythmic events. The combination of impaired heart rate variability and late potentials had a sensitivity of 58%, a positive predictive accuracy of 33% and a relative risk of 18.5 for arrhythmic events and was superior to other combinations including those incorporating left ventricular function, exercise ECG, ventricular ectopic beat frequency and repetitive ventricular forms. These results suggest that a simple method of assessment based on heart rate variability and the signal-averaged ECG can select a small subgroup of survivors of myocardial infarction at high risk of future life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death.\r"

  ".W": "Much effort has been spent to improve survival after acute myocardial infarction. To investigate how effective this effort has been, a meta-analysis was performed of studies published between 1960 and 1987 concerning mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Thirty-six studies were analyzed. They were classified with respect to deaths in the hospital and at 1 month and the 5-year mortality rate starting at hospital discharge. Mortality was assessed from all studies by comparing studies from different institutions with use of identical inclusion criteria (externally controlled studies) and by analyzing studies reporting on changes in mortality in two or more comparable patient cohorts admitted to the same institution at different time periods (internally controlled studies). Reports on clinical trials (for example, thrombolytic therapy, beta-adrenergic blockade) in acute myocardial infarction were excluded. Average overall in-hospital mortality decreased from 29% during the 1960s to 21% during the 1970s and to 16% during the 1980s. The externally controlled studies also showed a declining trend: from 1960 to 1969, 32%, from 1970 to 1979, 19% and from 1980 to 1987, 15%. The 1-month overall mortality rate decreased from 31% during the 1960s to 25% during the 1970s and 18% during the 1980s externally controlled studies. Most internally controlled studies also showed significant improvement in in-hospital and 1-month survival. In contrast, 5-year mortality after hospital discharge did not significantly decrease (33% from 1960 to 1969 and 33% from 1970 to 1979). It is concluded that in the prethrombolytic era, short-term prognosis after acute myocardial infarction has improved since 1960.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the spring and summer of 1981, an epidemic of a new illness now referred to as the toxic oil syndrome occurred in central and northwestern Spain, resulting in some 20,000 cases, 12,000 hospital admissions and greater than 300 deaths in the 1st year of the epidemic. The initial onset of illness was usually acute, and patients presented primarily with a respiratory syndrome involving cough, fever, dyspnea, hypoxemia, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions. While approximately 50% of patients recovered from this acute phase of the illness without apparent sequelae, the remaining patients developed an intermediate or chronic phase, or both, of illness involving severe myalgia, eosinophilia, peripheral nerve damage, sclerodermiform skin lesions, sicca syndrome, alopecia and joint contractures, among other findings. Epidemiologic and analytic chemical studies have clearly linked the toxic oil syndrome to the ingestion of oil mixtures containing rapeseed oil denatured with aniline. However, the precise identity of the etiologic agent within this oil has never been determined. Aniline itself did not cause the illness, but the causal agent may be a reaction product of aniline with some oil component. Although many aspects of disease activity in the involved patients have lessened with time, the ultimate consequences of their disease are not clear and are the subject of ongoing study. The recently described eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in the United States clinically resembles the toxic oil syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the use of adenosine as an alternative agent for determination of coronary vasodilator reserve, hemodynamics and coronary blood flow velocity were measured at rest and during peak hyperemic responses to continuous intravenous adenosine infusion (50, 100 and 150 micrograms/kg per min for 3 min) and intracoronary papaverine (10 mg) in 34 patients (17 without [group 1] and 17 with [group 2] significant left coronary artery disease), and in 17 patients (11 without and 6 with left coronary artery disease) after low dose (2.5 mg) intravenous bolus injection of adenosine. The maximal adenosine dose did not change mean arterial pressure (-10 +/- 14% and -6 +/- 12% for groups 1 and 2, respectively) but increased the heart rate (15 +/- 18% and 13 +/- 16, respectively). For continuous adenosine infusions, mean coronary flow velocity increased 64 +/- 104%, 122 +/- 94% and 198 +/- 59% and 15 +/- 51%, 110 +/- 95% and 109 +/- 86% in groups 1 and 2, respectively for each of the three doses. Mean coronary flow velocity increased significantly after 100 and 150 micrograms/kg of adenosine and 10 mg of intracoronary papaverine (48 +/- 25, 52 +/- 19 and 54 +/- 21 cm/s, respectively; all p less than 0.05 vs. baseline) and was significantly higher than in group 2 (37 +/- 24, 32 +/- 16, 41 +/- 23 cm/s; all p less than 0.05 vs. group 1). The coronary vasodilator reserve ratio (calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to basal mean flow velocity) for adenosine and papaverine was 2.94 +/- 1.50 and 2.94 +/- 1.00, respectively, in group 1 and was significantly and similarly reduced in group 2 (2.16 +/- 0.81 and 2.38 +/- 0.78, respectively; both p less than 0.05 vs. group 1). Low dose bolus injection of adenosine increased mean velocity equivalently to that after continuous infusion of 100 micrograms/kg, but less than after papaverine. There was a strong correlation between adenosine infusion and papaverine for both mean coronary flow velocity and coronary vasodilator reserve ratio (r2 = 0.871 and 0.325; SEE = 0.068 and 0.189, respectively; both p less than 0.0005). No patient had significant arrhythmias or prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval with adenosine, but papaverine increased the QT (QTc) interval from 445 +/- 44 to 501 +/- 43 ms (p less than 0.001 vs. both maximal adenosine and baseline) and produced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Accordingly, the tolerance and safety profile of adenosine infusion were analyzed in 607 patients (351 men, 256 women, mean age 63 +/- 11 years) undergoing this test either because of suspected coronary artery disease (Group I, n = 482) or for risk stratification early (5.2 +/- 2.8 days) after myocardial infarction (Group II, n = 125). Adenosine increased the heart rate from 74.5 +/- 14.0 to 91.8 +/- 15.9 beats/min (p less than 0.001) and decreased systolic blood pressure from 137.8 +/- 26.8 to 120.7 +/- 26.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Side effects were frequent and similar in both groups. Flushing occurred in 35%, chest pain in 34%, headache in 21% and dyspnea in 19% of patients. Only 35.6% of Group I patients with chest pain during adenosine infusion had concomitant transient perfusion abnormalities, compared with 60.7% of Group II patients (p less than 0.05). First- and second-degree AV block occurred in 9.6% and 3.6% of patients, respectively, and ischemic ST changes in 12.5% of cases. Concomitance of chest pain and ischemic ST depression was uncommon (6%) but, when present, predicted perfusion abnormalities in 73% of patients. Most side effects ceased rapidly after stopping the adenosine infusion. The side effects were severe in only 1.6% of patients and in only six patients (1%) was it necessary to discontinue the infusion. No serious adverse reactions such as acute myocardial infarction or death occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tomographic images were assessed visually and from computer-quantified polar maps of the thallium-201 distribution. Significant coronary artery disease, defined as greater than 50% luminal diameter stenosis, was present in 70 patients. The sensitivity for detecting patients with coronary artery disease using quantitative analysis was 87% in the total group, 82% in patients without myocardial infarction and 96% in those with prior myocardial infarction; the specificity was 90%. The sensitivity for diagnosing coronary artery disease in patients without infarction with single-, double-and triple-vessel disease was 76%, 86% and 90%, respectively. All individual stenoses were identified in 68% of patients with double-vessel disease and in 65% of those with triple-vessel disease. The extent of the perfusion defects, as quantified by polar maps, was directly related to the extent of coronary artery disease. In conclusion, quantitative thallium-201 SPECT during adenosine infusion has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing the presence of coronary artery disease, localizing the anatomic site of coronary stenosis and identifying the majority of affected vascular regions in patients with multivessel involvement.\r"

In four patients (group II), the head-up tilt test was negative at baseline and after isoproterenol infusion. Syncope was induced during baseline head-up tilt in nine patients (group III) and after isoproterenol challenge in five (group IV). The echocardiographic variables assessed were left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic areas and percent fractional shortening. At the end of head-up tilt, end-systolic area decreased by 4.5 +/- 1.3 and 3.0 +/- 1.2 cm2 in groups III and IV, respectively, compared with 0.5 +/- 0.7 and 0.2 +/- 0.1 cm2 in groups I and II, respectively (p less than 0.04). Similarly, end-diastolic area decreased by 5.5 +/- 2.6 cm2 in group III compared with 2.7 +/- 1.9 and 1.75 +/- 0.4 cm2 in group I and II, respectively (p less than 0.04). Additionally, at the end of the baseline study, fractional shortening was significantly greater in group III and group IV (43 +/- 5%) than in groups I and II (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, syncope induced by head-up tilt is associated with vigorous myocardial contraction and a significant decrease in left ventricular end-systolic dimensions. This left ventricular hypercontractility may play an important role in the pathogenesis of syncope induced by head-up tilt.\r"

The time constant of left ventricular isovolumetric pressure decrease and left ventricular end-diastolic myocardial stiffness was calculated. The 58 patients were classified into two groups according to ejection fraction: group I (n = 30; ejection fraction greater than 55%) and group II (n = 28; ejection fraction less than 50%). Compared with the control subjects, patients in group I had impairment only of left ventricular relaxation (time constant 47 +/- 9 vs. 38 +/- 3 ms; p less than 0.01), whereas patients in group II had, in addition to impaired left ventricular relaxation (time constant 52 +/- 11 vs. 38 +/- 3 ms; p less than 0.01), increased preload, increased pulmonary capillary pressure (12 +/- 8 vs. 5 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and increased myocardial stiffness (2,018 +/- 980 vs. 1,050 +/- 218 g/cm2; p less than 0.01). In group I, there was a significant partial correlation coefficient between the time constant and deceleration half-time (r = 0.54).

  ".W": "The natural history of aortic regurgitation is incompletely understood in part because of the lack of a simple method to estimate the defect size. A method of determining the effective regurgitant orifice area that combines Doppler catheter and Doppler echocardiographic techniques and is based on the principle of conservation of mass (the continuity equation) is described. To validate the application of the Doppler catheter system for measuring regurgitant supravalvular diastolic flow, an in vitro model of retrograde aortic flow was used. These studies indicated that measurements of supravalvular retrograde velocity with the Doppler catheter accurately reflect retrograde diastolic velocity when the aorta is less than 4.8 cm in diameter. Twenty-three patients undergoing cardiac catheterization were studied; 20 of these patients had aortic regurgitation. Retrograde supravalvular diastolic velocity was determined from a Doppler catheter positioned above the aortic valve. The effective regurgitant orifice area was calculated with use of the Doppler catheter-derived regurgitant volume and mean transvalvular diastolic velocity as determined by either catheterization or continuous wave Doppler echocardiography. The catheterization-derived regurgitant orifice area increased with the angiographic grade of as follows: 1+ (0.04 to 0.10 cm2), 2+ (0.15 to 0.49 cm2), 3+ (0.29 to 1.11 cm2) and 4+ (1.24 to 1.33 cm2). By combining Doppler catheter, echocardiographic and cardiac catheterization techniques, the effective aortic regurgitant orifice area may be estimated; this hydrodynamic area correlates with grading by supravalvular aortography. Calculation of this area provides a quantitative alternative to aortography for estimating the severity of aortic regurgitation but should be used with caution in patients with a markedly dilated aorta.\r"

Simultaneous pressure transducer and Doppler measurements were made in new and explanted aortic bioprosthetic valves of several sizes and four types: Carpentier-Edwards, Ionescu-Shiley, Hancock standard and Hancock modified. The mean and peak gradients calculated by the modified Bernoulli equation from Doppler velocity measurements were always greater than those measured manometrically, despite corrections for location dependence of the manometric gradient (or pressure recovery). The relation between manometric and ultrasonically determined gradient was found to be statistically dependent on the valve type (mean gradient p less than 0.0001; peak gradient p = 0.0003) and size (mean gradient p = 0.0089; peak gradient p = 0.0107). Effects of implantation were observed, but were not shown to be significant. It is concluded that the continuous wave Doppler velocity data overestimated prosthetic valve pressure gradient in all cases, even when pressure recovery was taken into account. Clinicians should be wary of Doppler data when making major diagnostic or therapeutic decisions.\r"

  ".W": "The time-dependent physiologic variations of the cardiac conduction system were evaluated at repeated invasive studies in 10 healthy individuals. Their mean age was 28 years (range 22 to 34) and they volunteered to undergo two electrophysiologic studies at intervals of 14 to 63 days (mean 25). The coefficients of variation, repeatability and reproducibility, which should be the preferred statistics when assessing the reproducibility of continuous variables, were calculated. The mean sinus cycle length had a high reproducibility, with coefficients of variation between 2% and 6%. The mean and maximal sinus node recovery times, however, varied considerably. The reproducibility was very high for ventricular depolarization and repolarization (QRS, JT, QT), with coefficients of variation between 2% and 6%. The coefficients of variation were below the acceptable 10% value for intraatrial conduction, atrioventricular (AV) node conduction, His-Purkinje conduction as well as the Wenckebach point; for the effective refractory period of the AV node, it was 12%. Repeat invasive electrophysiologic testing is a safe and reproducible method for evaluating and comparing cardioactive drug effects in healthy subjects. The same statistical analyses were applied to previously published studies on continuous electrophysiologic variables, which allowed comparisons among different groups of healthy and sick persons, as well as among different electrophysiologic variables and procedures. Furthermore, the minimal actual treatment differences that can be detected with a reasonable (80%) probability at a predetermined (5%) significance level using a crossover design were estimated for different electrophysiologic variables. These data will assist in the calculation of the necessary sample size for clinical trials and related purposes.\r"

  ".W": "Between December 1985 and April 1990, 50 infants with a variety of congenital cardiac lesions other than the hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent surgical relief of aortic outflow obstruction by creation of a pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis. The patients were grouped anatomically by ventriculoarterial alignment. Nineteen had normally aligned great arteries (group I); 25 had transposition of the great arteries, all with a univentricular heart of left ventricular morphology (group II); and 6 had a double-outlet right ventricle (group III). All patients had either aortic stenosis with atresia, subaortic stenosis or a restrictive ventricular septal defect. Sixteen had normal arch anatomy; 34 had arch anomalies consisting of arch hypoplasia (n = 17), coarctation (n = 11), interruption of the arch (n = 4) and complex arch anomalies (n = 2). Surgery was performed at a median age of 10 days (range 2 to 184). Of the 50 infants, 33 survived. No significant difference in early survival (30 days) was noted among the groups of varying ventriculoarterial alignment (68% group I, 72% group II, 83% group III) (p greater than 0.05). Overall actuarial survival was 63% at 18 months. Analysis of actuarial survival by arch anatomy, although not statistically significant, revealed a trend toward better survival at 18 months postoperatively in infants with normal arch anatomy (81%) than in infants with arch anomalies (54%). Of the 33 survivors, 26 have proceeded to the next surgical stage, including the Fontan procedure in 8, superior cavopulmonary anastomosis in 13 and biventricular repair in 5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study evaluated the postoperative status after a stage I palliative operation (Norwood procedure) for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The NMR images from three patients were compared with those of angiography and depicted all components of the reconstructed supracardiac and intracardiac anatomy after this operation. Nonobstructive anastomosis of the main pulmonary artery to the proximal aorta was clearly demonstrated in each patient. The caliber of the central or branch pulmonary artery, patency and caliber of the systemic to pulmonary artery shunt and the size of the atrial communication were also depicted in each patient and these findings corresponded with angiographic results. The results suggest that NMR imaging is effective for assessing the results of initial palliative surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which seems to be important for managing patients before subsequent definitive surgery.\r"

  ".U": "91332334\r", 
  ".W": "An accurate but simple and noninvasive method for quantifying flow across a ventricular septal defect has yet to be implemented for routine clinical use. A region of flow convergence is commonly imaged by Doppler color flow mapping on the left septal surface of the ventricular septal defect, appearing as a narrowed region of laminar flow with aliased flow velocities entering the orifice. If the first aliasing region represents a hemispheric isovelocity boundary of a surface of flow convergence and all flow at this surface crosses the ventricular septal defect, the flow through the defect can be estimated by using the radius (R), measured from the first alias to the orifice, and the Nyquist limit (NL) velocity (the flow velocity at the first alias). Doppler color flow imaging was performed in 18 children with a single membranous ventricular septal defect undergoing cardiac catheterization at a mean age of 29.8 months (Group I). Indexes of maximal flow rate across the defect were developed from either the radius or the area, obtained by planimetry, of the first alias, based on Doppler color flow images. All indexes were corrected for body surface area and compared with shunt flow (Qp-Qs) and pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) determined at cardiac catheterization. Doppler color flow indexes derived from images of flow convergence in both the long-axis (n = 15) and oblique four-chamber (n = 10) views correlated closely with Qp/Qs (r = 0.71 to 0.92) and Qp - Qs (r = 0.69 to 0.97).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The latter may be difficult in the presence of hypoplastic pulmonary arteries. Long-term prostaglandin therapy may be used to maintain ductal patency but is not without limitation and side effects. This experimental study describes a novel approach to maintain ductal patency with a stainless steel stent. Six newborn lambs less than or equal to 48-h old had a ductal stent placed during right heart catheterization. Two lambs less than 36-h old had a stent delivered by the arterial route. The stent was delivered and released at the target with relative ease and no incidence of embolization. Continued ductal patency up to 3 months was demonstrated by repeat cardiac catheterization and angiography, two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography and postmortem examination. The experimental model provides a left to right shunt model in which the size may be increased as the animal grows. More important, a ductal stent could be used to maintain ductal blood flow in neonates and infants with ductal-dependent cardiac malformations, thereby avoiding a thoracotomy.\r"

  ".W": "Diastolic mitral regurgitation is a common finding that can be detected with use of Doppler echocardiographic techniques in patients with atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities. With use of simultaneous hemodynamic and Doppler techniques, mitral flow velocity, mitral valve motion and transmitral pressure gradient were studied during 50 cardiac cycles each of spontaneous or atrial paced first- and second-degree AV block in five lightly sedated dogs. Diastolic mitral regurgitation was detected during atrial relaxation on all beats in which ventricular contraction was delayed greater than 190 ms. In all dogs the diastolic regurgitation was associated with a reverse transmitral pressure gradient (3.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg in first-degree AV block and 3.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg in second-degree AV block) that occurred primarily as the result of a decrease in atrial pressure with atrial relaxation. These reverse pressure gradients were as large as the maximal forward transmitral gradients in early diastole (2.9 +/- 0.9 mm Hg in first-degree AV block and 3.1 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in second-degree AV block) and larger than the maximal forward pressure gradients at atrial contraction (1.7 +/- 0.5 and 1.4 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.05). The maximal reverse pressure gradient during atrial relaxation was also as large as the reverse pressure gradient in mid-diastole (2.7 +/- 0.9 and 2.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, respectively), associated with deceleration of early diastolic mitral flow. Peak diastolic mitral regurgitation velocity coincided with the maximal reverse transmitral gradient and was usually larger than anterograde mitral flow velocity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adenosine infusion into the circumflex coronary artery increased endocardial and transmural blood flow to that territory (measured by microspheres) by 436% and 487%, respectively (both p less than 0.05), and shifted the left circumflex artery territory pressure-wall thickness curve upward (p less than 0.05) without affecting the circumflex pressure-segment length, the left anterior descending artery territory pressure-segment length or pressure-wall thickness curves significantly; papaverine also shifted the circumflex region pressure-wall thickness curve upward (p less than 0.05). Both with and without vasodilation, moderate reductions in circumflex artery perfusion pressure did not affect the position of the ventricular pressure-wall thickness or the pressure-segment length curve (although during adenosine infusion endocardial blood flow decreased from 436% to approximately 100% of control values). More severe reductions in perfusion pressure (less than 45 mm Hg under control conditions and less than 30 mm Hg during adenosine infusion) decreased coronary blood flow below control values and caused a marked downward shift of the circumflex region pressure-segment length curve without affecting the position of the pressure-wall thickness curve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The vasoregulatory and contractile status of reperfused myocardium during normal and reduced perfusion pressures is of interest in the treatment of patients with unstable angina. In the present study the effects of 15 min of reversible ischemic injury on several aspects of coronary vasoregulation were assessed with use of pressure-flow curves in anesthetized open chest dogs. The left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated and perfused with arterial blood with use of a servo-controlled roller pump. The autoregulatory gain and an adenosine dose-response curve for coronary flow before and after ischemia and reperfusion were obtained. The maximal autoregulatory gain values in the pressure range of 140 to 60 mm Hg were not significantly different before and after ischemia and reperfusion (0.41 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.06, p greater than 0.1). The adenosine dose-response curve was significantly shifted to the right after reperfusion; however, coronary blood flows during maximal adenosine vasodilation over a large range of perfusion pressures (140 to 60 mm Hg) were significantly greater after ischemia and reperfusion. The pressure-dependent decrease in segment shortening (sonomicrometry) over the coronary pressure range of 160 to 30 mm Hg was similar in myocardium before and after stunning. Contractile function in the stunned myocardium at normal (100 mm Hg) and low (40 mm Hg) coronary perfusion pressures was similarly and significantly enhanced by the administration of adenosine. It is concluded that 1) coronary autoregulation is unchanged after brief ischemia and reperfusion; 2) although maximal coronary vascular conductance assessed with adenosine is greater after ischemia, the coronary circulation shows a decreased coronary sensitivity to exogenous adenosine; 3) the relation of contractile function to coronary pressure before and after stunning is unchanged; and 4) enhancement of function in stunned myocardium by vasodilation with adenosine occurs at low and normal perfusion pressures.\r"

Twenty-five dogs were subjected to 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The dogs were assigned to one of three experimental groups. The early diltiazem group received intracoronary diltiazem into the distal coronary bed at the onset of coronary occlusion and for 60 min after reperfusion. The late diltiazem group received the same amount of drug beginning 15 min before reperfusion and the control group received saline solution for 90 min of occlusion and 60 min of reperfusion. Infarct size expressed as a percent of the area at risk was significantly smaller in the early and late diltiazem groups (15.6 +/- 3.6% and 21.2 +/- 5.1%, respectively) than in the control group (49 +/- 4.6%) (p less than 0.05). Intracoronary diltiazem restored systolic function of the stunned, previously ischemic tissue to essentially normal preocclusion values. Segmental shortening after reperfusion averaged 21.6% in the early diltiazem group versus 0 +/- 1.7% and 7.3 +/- 4% for the control and late diltiazem groups, respectively (p less than 0.05). Low dose intracoronary diltiazem did not alter hemodynamic variables or myocardial blood flow but did improve segmental shortening 2 and 6 h after reperfusion. These data indicate that intracoronary diltiazem given during occlusion or just before reperfusion increases the salvage of myocardium compared with the salvage achieved by reperfusion alone. These results also suggest that intracoronary diltiazem given during the ischemic period enhances systolic contractile function of postischemic stunned myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Accordingly, to compare the effects of reocclusion versus sustained occlusion on the myocardium, a canine model (n = 12) of 2 h of left circumflex artery occlusion, 1 h of reperfusion and 1 h of reocclusion was studied. In a control group (n = 11), 3 h of circumflex artery occlusion was followed by 1 h of reperfusion. As a result, both groups had the same total duration of ischemia (3 h) and reperfusion (1 h). Hemodynamic measurements, radioactive microsphere injections and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed at baseline, occlusion and reperfusion for both groups and at the end of reocclusion for the experimental group. In vivo risk area was determined with Evans blue dye and infarct size with triphenyltetrazolium staining methods. Similar decreases in myocardial blood flow after coronary occlusion and similar reperfusion blood flows occurred in both groups. Despite intervening reperfusion in the reocclusion group, no significant difference was found in the infarct size/risk area ratio between the reocclusion and control groups (54.5 +/- 6.9% vs. 48.4 +/- 5.1%, respectively, p = NS). Two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated a similar degree and extent (159 +/- 9 degrees vs. 153 +/- 12 degrees, p = NS) of left ventricular dysfunction with both the occlusion and reocclusion. In addition, there were no significant differences in global or regional left ventricular function between the two groups. However, reocclusion after reperfusion did produce a further deterioration in ischemic zone wall thickening (9.5 +/- 2.0% to 0.7 +/- 1.8%, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Gymnasts were in the 50th percentile for weight:height ratio, regardless of age. However, weight:age and height:age percentiles progressively dropped from the 48th to the 20th as age increased. Body fat percentage did not differ significantly between age groups. Triceps and subscapular skinfolds were 63% and 56%, respectively, of the age-related standard for the younger group and 52% and 39%, respectively, of the age-related standard for the older group. Arm muscle circumference and calculated arm muscle area of the gymnasts were in about the 75th percentile, regardless of age grouping. In general, as they grew older, gymnasts became progressively smaller in weight and height for age but were highly muscled for size. The steady age-related drop in height:age and weight:age percentile may be attributable to nutritional deficits, a sport-specific selection favoring retention of small but powerful gymnasts, or a combination of these factors. We recommend that young gymnasts be carefully observed longitudinally by trained nutrition professionals to ensure that inadequate nutrient intake is not a contributing factor to poor growth or health.\r"

Pica behavior was considered in terms of its prevalence, risk factors, clinical profile, and effect on pregnancy outcome. Data on pica practices by pregnant women are limited and inconclusive but reveal several interesting relationships. The prevalence of pica among pregnant women in high-risk groups declined between the 1950s and the 1970s but now remains steady, affecting about one fifth of high-risk women. Women at high risk of pica are more likely to be black, to live in rural areas, and to have a positive childhood and family history of pica. The clinical picture of the disorder during pregnancy is not well described. The evidence suggests that pica during pregnancy results in anemia, but it is not definitive. Pica also has been associated with maternal and perinatal mortality. We conclude that the behavior is more prevalent than commonly believed, shows no sign of further decline, and may have serious effects, particularly anemia, on mother and infant. Dietetic practitioners who counsel pregnant women should ask questions about pica when they conduct nutrition assessments of their clients.\r"

Among the non-Southeast Asian infants, the initiation of breast-feeding was associated with higher parental education and with being married. Ethnic group, level of poverty, and participation in the Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children during pregnancy did not appear to influence the initiation of breast-feeding. The findings indicate a higher incidence of breast-feeding than in previous surveys of low-income black and white women; however, this may reflect the higher educational level of the non-Southeast Asian study population. In contrast, the sharp decline in the incidence of breast-feeding among Southeast Asian infants who were born in the United States compared with those who were foreign born indicates the need for public health approaches to strengthen traditional breast-feeding practices.\r"

  ".W": "Randomly chosen medical charts of 212 elderly subjects in 11 nursing homes were reviewed to determine which characteristics of the subjects were most closely associated with their diet prescriptions. The chart reviews indicated that 104 (49.0%) of the 212 subjects had some type of nutrient-modified diet prescription. Eight patients who were tube fed were not included in subsequent analyses. Sodium restriction was the most common modification (60 [29.4%] of the remaining 204 patients) and calorie-controlled diets were also common (52 [25.5%] of the patients). Of the 55 patients with hypertension, 31 (56.4%) had no sodium restriction. Only 10% of all low-sodium diets limited sodium to 2 g per day. Of the 38 patients with diabetes, 7 (18.4%) had no prescription for calorie control, and there was no indication that increased dietary fiber was encouraged for diabetic patients. Only one of the 121 subjects with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease or atherosclerosis had a prescription for a cholesterol-lowering diet. Characteristics of the subjects not specifically related to diet or diagnosis, such as age, sex, duration of stay, and level of care, had no significant relationship to diet prescription. These findings suggest that the practitioners in our sample were not convinced of the efficacy of modified diets to control disease for most nursing home residents.\r"

  ".U": "91332349\r", 
  ".W": "In this study we determined how consultant dietitians working in Wisconsin skilled nursing facilities distributed their time among contracted duties. At the time of the study, the 400 skilled nursing facilities in Wisconsin employed 160 consultant dietitians. Of these, 135 consultant dietitians were eligible to participate in the study. A mailed questionnaire was used to collect data on educational background, experience, and actual time spent in state-recommended functions, additional resident-care functions, and additional non-resident-care functions. Completed, usable questionnaires were returned by 65 (48%) of the 135 consultant dietitians. Data were analyzed statistically and presented as medians, means, and standard deviations. Mean time (minutes) consultant dietitians spent per resident admission activity was as follows: data collection, 31.3; care planning, 28.9; resident counseling, 18.5; medical record review, 17.7; discharge referral, 15.4. Mean time (minutes) consultant dietitians spent per month in other activities was as follows: facility evaluation, 75.3; student training, 120; allied staff training, 38.7; foodservice staff training, 46.8; technician training, 128; menu planning, 76.9; diet manual review, 21.6; quality assurance programs, 31.8; quality assurance audits, 34; report preparation for facility administrator, 33.4; and policy development, 32.8. Mean times reported in this study may be used as time guidelines by the state of Wisconsin for evaluating how skilled nursing facilities contract for services of consultant dietitians. Other state and federal regulatory agencies could use the time guidelines for comparison and verification until future studies provide more data on time standards for state-recommended functions, additional resident-care functions, and additional non-resident-care functions.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a unique, family-oriented approach to lowering plasma cholesterol concentrations in persons with familial hyperlipidemias. The approach includes individual clinic visits and group nutrition classes and uses dietary goals outlined in The New American Diet. A series of 13 nutrition classes is presented to small groups, usually composed of relatives from pedigrees with familial hypercholesterolemia or other familial hyperlipidemias. Dietary action goals, cooking demonstrations, food tasting, and finger-stick plasma cholesterol determinations are important components of the classes. Problem-solving discussion is encouraged in the group. Over the past 4 years, 143 hyperlipidemic individuals, along with at least 94 unaffected family members, have participated in 31 groups, which have met for at least six classes. Many clinic participants lower plasma cholesterol by 20% or more. Keys to the success of this program include emphasizing dietary therapy, using the family setting for nutrition intervention, providing hands-on experience with food and recipes, promoting problem solving for dietary action goals, measuring blood cholesterol during classes, and encouraging long-term follow-up for participants with physicians and dietitians.\r"

However, information concerning these interactions is lacking, even though they can occur frequently. Minerals in foods can complex with drugs and/or alter the gastrointestinal environment to affect the normal absorption processes of drugs and minerals. There are three types of drug-mineral interactions: (a) malabsorption of the mineral and/or drug; (b) mineral depletion and retention; and (c) drug-mineral interactions induced by simultaneous antacid ingestion. It is recommended that oral drugs be administered on an empty stomach 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal and at least 2 hours before or after antacid use. A small snack of refined carbohydrates with low nutrient density can be consumed with drugs that cause gastric upset when given on an empty stomach.\r"

The technical and material developments of the nineteenth century led to a form of practical internationalism that was expressed also in the health sector. The Pan American Health Organization was established in 1902 to coordinate health issues in the Western Hemisphere. The Health Office of the League of Nations, now little known, played an important role in the 1920s and 1930s, particularly in the control of epidemic diseases in Eastern Europe and later in nutrition. The general framework of the League Health Office became the basis of the World Health Organization, founded in 1946. Certain international agencies play a special role in health; of these, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank have a worldwide role. The Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) are examples of essentially regional organizations with considerable influence. Private voluntary organizations, missions, and foundations have also had a substantial effect on health in certain circumstances.\r"

  ".U": "91332401\r", 
  ".W": "Among the many variables that influence the outcome of national health status in both developed and developing countries, the availability and efficiency of financing is critical. For 148 developing countries, annual public and private expenditures from domestic sources (1983) were estimated to be approximately $100 billion. For the United States alone, annual public and private costs for medical care are almost five times larger ($478 billion, 1988). In contrast to domestic expenditures, the total flow of donor assistance for health in 1986 was estimated to be $4 billion, approximately 5% of total current domestic expenditures by developing countries. Direct donor assistance for development purposes by the United States Government approximates 0.5% of the US federal budget (1988). Approximately 10% of all United States development assistance is allocated for health, nutrition, and population planning purposes. While the total health sector contribution is on the order of $500 million annually, the US contribution represents about 13% of health contributions by all external donors. In sub-Saharan Africa, all donor health allocations only reach 3.4% of total development assistance. While available data suggest that private and voluntary organizations contribute approximately 20% of total global health assistance, data reporting methods from private agencies are not sufficiently specific to provide accurate global estimates. Clearly, developing countries as a whole are dependent on the efficient use of their own resources because external financing remains a small fraction of total domestic financing. Nevertheless, improvement in health sector performance often depends on the sharing of western experience and technology, services available through external donor cooperation. In this effort, the available supply of donor financing for health is not restricted entirely by donor policy, but also by the official demand for external financing as submitted by developing countries. In perspective, the supply of financing for health greatly exceeds the receipt of well-articulated and officially approved proposals from developing countries. The major constraints that produce this imbalance are unfamiliarity of ministries of health with potential donor sources; passive approaches to external financing; unfamiliarity with proposal preparation; increasing competition within developing countries by competing sectors, such as industry and agriculture; limited numbers of trained personnel; and absence of an international system which is able to support developing countries in mobilizing external financing. Tested solutions to these issues have been applied in one geographic region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Clinical epidemiologists in developing countries can significantly contribute to the manpower available for ENHR. They play a major role in the provision and practice of appropriate health care by contributing to the critical assessment of priority health problems and by carrying out scientific evaluation of new and conventional intervention tools. In clinical epidemiology units in developing countries, transdisciplinary collaboration with social scientists and health economics has enhanced the capacity to do research that would influence decision-making and health policy, even as links with ministries of health and other ENHR-committed networks are being strengthened. The potential for carrying out ENHR will be multiplied as national and regional training centers for clinical epidemiology in selected developing countries are established.\r"

  ".W": "The optimal use of biotechnology to address the health care needs of developing countries entails the formation of interdisciplinary working groups linking basic biomedical scientists with public health workers, epidemiologists, physicians, and social scientists. Their mission should be congruent with and guided by the public health goals and primary care program of the country or region. Moreover, their research and development activities should lead to products that address a specific need and which are evaluable, cost-effective, and readily transferred to the public health sector. With respect to the enteric infections of childhood, the essential components of an integrated control effort are a field site where infections of this kind are common and readily studied; a local public health laboratory where the performance of new products can be tested and where technology transfer can occur; a basic science laboratory where molecular pathogenicity studies lead to new diagnostic tests, vaccines, and drugs; and a production laboratory where these products can be refined and prepared in sufficient amounts for field testing. This strategy is now being evaluated for the control of infantile diarrhea through the combined use of epidemiologic investigations, DNA probe and amplification techniques, and molecular fingerprinting. Together, these methods are yielding new information about microbial reservoirs and transmission systems; in turn, this information should lead to highly focused public health interventions.\r"

Etiologic studies have clarified the role of Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae as the pathogens most responsible for childhood pneumonia in developing countries. Case management intervention strategies using community health workers to identify cases of pneumonia by counting respiratory rate and observing chest indrawing have been shown to reduce ARI-related mortality. Although research is underway to develop more effective vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-type b H. influenzae, effective case management will remain the most realistic method of reducing mortality in the next decade. Important gaps remain in our understanding of the pathogenesis, etiology, and epidemiology of acute respiratory infections. Our understanding is complicated by the multiplicity of viral and bacterial agents and their interrelationships, by an abundance of interacting host risk factors, and by diverse social, cultural, and environmental factors. However, sufficient knowledge is available to support the implementation of the WHO case management intervention strategies, which will save the lives of the many children now dying because of pneumonia.\r"
