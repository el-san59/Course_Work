Concerns about safety, especially the risk of anaphylaxis and the risk of damage to the spinal cord, were frequent. The effectiveness of this procedure for this indication was also questioned by many of the panelists. The panel did agree that chemonucleolysis is unacceptable as either safe or effective for use in patients with a herniated lumbar disk that is extruding nucleus pulposus through the annulus. Accordingly, diagnostic imaging of any suspect disk must be performed before chemonucleolysis can be deemed appropriate for any individual patient. Current imaging techniques are not infallible and cannot confer an absolute sense of security when seeming to indicate a nonextruded protruding disk.\r"

  ".W": "At least 34 Hollywood films were made between The Lost Weekend (1945) and Days of Wine and Roses (1962) with an alcoholic as a major character; six depicted an Alcoholics Anonymous-like self-help organization. Presentations of alcoholism's origin as mysterious competed with psychodynamic interpretations and situational explanations, often in the same film and sometimes concerning the same character. Will-power and mutual help were each frequently shown as paths to recovery, whereas neither professional treatment nor AA's spiritual side were often shown. For the women alcoholics (17 of 39 depicted), drinking went with sexuality, but for men it replaced it. \"Creative\" occupations were hugely overrepresented among screen alcoholics, in part reflecting the personal struggles with drinking of the movies' creators. These writers, actors and directors were drawn from the \"wet generations\" of middle-class youth, who had adopted heavy drinking in their college years as a generational revolt against \"Victorian morality.\" Alcoholics Anonymous was founded and peopled by members of these same cohorts as a generational solution to their eventual life-problems. The flurry of alcoholism films represented a parallel and overlapping generational response.\r"

There were five gastric and seven duodenal perforations. Vague abdominal pain was the most common symptom. Exploration was delayed in six patients because of an absence of physical findings. All patients received a Graham omental patch. The in-hospital operative mortality was 33%, with all major complications occurring in those that died. There were no prognostic indicators identified that would preoperatively predict outcome. Aggressive surgical intervention is advised in all patients who have a reasonable chance of worthwhile palliation if not cure.\r"

Fourteen patients (39%) responded to this treatment, with the duration of remission ranging from 2 to 24 + months (the mean and median were 11 months). In 22 patients, PR levels were measured both before and after 7 days of tamoxifen administration. In PR-positive patients, PR changes induced by tamoxifen did not appear to increase the response rate. In PR-negative patients, PR became positive in 3 patients following tamoxifen treatment, with 2 of 3 responding to treatment, whereas in 11 others whose PR levels remained negative, only one response was observed. Our results suggest that potentiation by tamoxifen was not observed, since in our previous study, MPA alone was equally effective. Thus, tamoxifen and MPA should be given independently for palliation of metastatic breast cancer, and MPA should be administered following therapy with tamoxifen.\r"

The two groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, cardiac lesion, presence of cyanosis, and prevalence of Down's syndrome. Results showed no significant difference in postoperative blood loss between the two groups (30.5 +/- 37.9 ml/kg in the placebo group versus 40.0 +/- 33.1 ml/kg in the desmopressin group). Postoperative bleeding time, total urine output, postinfusion hemodynamics, and postoperative coagulation studies did not differ significantly between the two groups. We conclude that postbypass desmopressin infusion does not reduce blood loss in children undergoing cardiac operations.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated increasing left ventricular mass in cyclosporine-treated cardiac allograft recipients over 30 days after transplantation, but the long-term evolution of this process and possible effects on allograft function are unknown. Accordingly, quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography was performed 2 and 23 days and 15 months postoperatively in 14 recipients treated with cyclosporine and prednisone. Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, mass, and end-systolic wall stress were analyzed. Comparison of studies at 2 and 23 days revealed significant (p less than 0.01) increases in ejection fraction (54% +/- 8% [standard deviation] to 62% +/- 4%), end-diastolic volume (84% +/- 32 ml to 96 +/- 31 ml), and left ventricular mass (118 +/- 45 gm to 136 +/- 41 gm). Comparison of studies at 23 days and 15 months revealed no significant change in end-diastolic volume or left ventricular mass, whereas ejection fraction decreased slightly (62% +/- 4% to 57% +/- 4%, p less than 0.01). End-systolic wall stress decreased when data at 2 days and 15 months were compared (83 +/- 24 gm/cm2 versus 66 +/- 18 gm/cm2, p less than 0.05), but no change in contractility was apparent from the ejection fraction/end-systolic stress relation. We conclude that left ventricular mass and end-diastolic volume increase early after transplantation in cyclosporine-treated cardiac allograft recipients, but these changes are not predictive of long-term results, which are characterized by no significant late variation in left ventricular mass, end-diastolic volume, or contractility.\r"

With an indirect immunoperoxidase technique on frozen sections a diffuse interstitial increase of WT14-positive cells was seen, with a characteristic peritubular pattern, in all 44 patients with clinically and histologically proven AIR. This pattern was not seen in normal kidneys (n = 10), or in biopsy specimens from patients with proven cyclosporin nephrotoxicity (n = 9), chronic vascular rejection (n = 13), or various other renal diseases (n = 60). Comparative staining with other monoclonal antibodies against monocytes/macrophages showed a variable, mostly weak or less specific staining pattern than did WT14. The increased staining with WT14 proved to be a better indicator of AIR than increased HLA-DR staining on tubular epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Two investigations concerning anesthetic and educational considerations for laser safety in microlaryngeal carbon dioxide laser surgery have been performed. The first study demonstrated that attendance at a \"hands-on\" laser surgery course that stressed safety precautions was associated with a reduced rate of laser-related complications in the selected group of otolaryngologists who participated in the course, when compared to another selected group of otolaryngologists who were members of a senior otolaryngology society, and surveyed solely on the basis of their society membership. The second series of studies compared the incendiary characteristics of three endotracheal tubes in various mixtures of oxygen, diluted with either helium or nitrogen. It was determined that the polyvinyl chloride tube should not be used for laser surgery, even when wrapped with reflective, metallic tape. The safest anesthetic gas mixture was found to be 30% oxygen in helium; the addition of 2% halothane did not have an adverse effect, as had been previously reported. Both the Xomed Laser-Shield and Rusch red rubber endotracheal tubes were found to be safe, when used with the laser in the pulsed mode in an atmosphere of 100% oxygen. When the laser was used in the continuous mode, both tubes ignited in an atmosphere of 30% oxygen in helium. These findings challenged the previously reported levels of safety associated with the use of an unwrapped Xomed tube. Based on the results of this investigation, it has been concluded that both the Rusch red rubber tube and the Xomed Laser-Shield tube should be wrapped with reflective, metallic tape, when used for cases of microlaryngeal surgery with the carbon dioxide laser.\r"

To analyze these differences, we modeled the diagnostic process at each hospital with a Bayesian procedure and performed a crossover study in which each patient was rediagnosed by the model from the opposite hospital. The results indicate that the differences in the frequency of lacune and subarachnoid hemorrhage were associated with the patient population, whereas the differences in the frequency of embolism and atherothrombosis were associated with the diagnostic process. There was a marked difference in the use of arteriograms on the two stroke services, but no difference in morbidity or mortality. The modeling procedure described can be used to compare clinical processes when the allocation of patients is thought to be biased.\r"

  ".W": "Several recent observations, such as the identification of the cellular homologue of the v-erb-A oncogene as a thyroid-hormone receptor, have strongly implicated nuclear oncogenes in transcriptional control mechanisms. The v-erb-A oncogene blocks the differentiation of erythroid cells, and changes the growth requirements of fibroblasts and erythroblasts. Mutations in v-erb-A protein have led to the loss of its affinity for thyroid hormones but do not affect its DNA-binding ability, a property required for biological activity. We report here the identification of a novel thyroid-hormone response element (TRE) in the long terminal repeat of Moloney murine leukaemia virus that binds the c-erb-A-alpha protein. The v-erb-A protein abolishes the responsiveness of this TRE to thyroid hormone, although it has a lower affinity than the normal receptor for the TRE. The data indicate that overexpressed v-erb-A protein negatively interferes with normal transcriptional-control mechanisms, and that amino-acid substitutions have altered its DNA-binding properties.\r"

  ".W": "Protein-protein interactions between two proteins have generally been studied using biochemical techniques such as crosslinking, co-immunoprecipitation and co-fractionation by chromatography. We have generated a novel genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of the properties of the GAL4 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization. It consists of two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain which binds to specific DNA sequences (UASG); and a C-terminal domain containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription. We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts of GAL4: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a protein 'X' and a GAL4 activating region fused to a protein 'Y'. If X and Y can form a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the GAL4 domains, transcription of a gene regulated by UASG occurs. We have tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to interact--SNF1 and SNF4. High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein by the use of a simple galactose selection.\r"

A disabling mutation in the protease results in the production of non-infectious virus particles and examination of proteins from these mutant virions reveals unprocessed Gag and Gag-Pol precursor proteins, the substrates of the viral protease. Each amino acid of the HIV-1 protease was individually mutated using a simple mutagenesis procedure which is capable of introducing and identifying missense mutations in each residue of a protein. Phenotypic screening of these mutants in a heterologous assay system reveals three regions within the protease where multiple consecutive amino-acid residues are sensitive to mutation. These results show that random mutagenesis can be used to identify functionally important regions within a protein. Mutants with conditional phenotypes have also been identified within this collection.\r"

Tissue-specific expression of MDR1 and other members of the MDR gene family has been observed in normal cells, suggesting a role for P-glycoproteins in secretion. We have isolated a gene from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encodes a protein very similar to mammalian P-glycoproteins. Deletion of this gene resulted in sterility of MATa, but not of MAT alpha cells. Subsequent analysis revealed that the yeast P-glycoprotein is the product of the STE6 gene, a locus previously shown to be required in MATa cells for production of a-factor pheromone. Our findings suggest that the STE6 protein functions to export the hydrophobic a-factor lipopeptide in a manner analogous to the efflux of hydrophobic cytotoxic drugs catalysed by the related mammalian P-glycoprotein. Thus, the evolutionarily conserved family of MDR-like genes, including the hlyB gene of Escherichia coli and the STE6 gene of S. cerevisiae, encodes components of secretory pathways distinct from the classical, signal sequence-dependent protein translocation system.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in invertebrates indicate that a rapid genomic response to neuronal stimulation has a critical role in long-term changes in synaptic efficacy. Because several of the genes (immediately early genes; IEGs) that respond rapidly to growth factor stimulation of vertebrate cells in vitro are also activated by neuronal stimulation in vivo, attention has focused on the possibility that they play a part in synaptic plasticity in vertebrate nervous systems. Four IEGs thought to encode transcription factors, zif/268 (also termed Egr-1, NGFI-A, Krox 24), c-fos, c-jun, and jun-B are rapidly induced in the brain by seizure activity, and we have now studied the induction of these genes in a well-characterized model of synaptic plasticity in the vertebrate brain--long-term potentiation (LTP) of the perforant pathgranule cell (pp-gc) synapse in vivo. We found that high-frequency (but not low-frequency) stimulation of the pp-gc synapse markedly increases zif/268 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the ipsilateral granule cell neurons; mRNA of c-fos, c-jun and jun-B is less consistently increased. The stimulus frequency and intensity required to increase zif/268 mRNA levels are similar to those required to induce LTP, which is also seen only ipsilaterally, and both responses are blocked by NMDA-receptor antagonists as well as by convergent synaptic inhibitory inputs already known to block LTP. Accordingly, zif/268 mRNA levels and LTP seem to be regulated by similar synaptic mechanisms.\r"

The individual must personally embrace the leadership standards of Sir William Osler and Harvey Cushing. One of the privileges of giving a presidential address is to pay public homage to those who have been supportive and instrumental in my long professional journey. During my residency, Dr. Dwight Parkinson was my mentor and teacher and set a wonderful standard for the ideal practice of neurosurgery. Decisions were black or white, never gray, with Dr. Parkinson, who left little doubt as to the correct way to handle clinical problems. He was, and continues to be, one of the most incisive, imaginative, innovative scientific minds in neurosurgery, and I owe him a great debt of gratitude. Two other men influenced my neurosurgical development. They are Dr. William Horsey, formerly neurosurgeon at the St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, and Dr. Peardon Donaghy, with whom I spent a most enjoyable and productive year in Burlington at his microvascular neurosurgical laboratory. These two men demonstrated the humility, warmth, and kindness to patients that cannot be learned by formal study, but comes from observing the example of people who manifest those qualities in their own personality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This clinical association requires repeated emphasis because of the potential benefit in management of patients with suspected metastatic disease. We have reviewed and summarized the reported literature and added our 8 cases. The mean age of presentation before the second tumor was 6 years. Breast carcinoma was diagnosed first in 85% of cases.

  ".W": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma in situ has been described as a relatively rare lesion. However, difficult decisions with respect to clinical management of the lesion in this location parallel those reported for other mucosal sites, such as the cervix or the larynx. The lesion, though superficial, may extend over a large area of tissue, and attempts at irradication with surgery or radiation therapy may be associated with a great deal of morbidity. However, the risks in deferral of treatment while \"watchfully waiting\" may also be unacceptable. A method and rationale for management of oral squamous cell carcinoma in situ with the use of topical 5-fluorouracil and carbon dioxide laser are described in this article. A technique for using an intraoral prosthesis to potentiate drug delivery is also described. Though morbidity can be very significantly reduced, patient compliance is an important consideration for success with this protocol.\r"

  ".W": "In spite of the many possible methods of pain control in the burned child satisfactory pain management may still be a problem, at times formidable. The most fruitful approach would seem to be frequent assessment of pain in the individual patient with a readiness to try alternative or additional measures when relief seems inadequate. In this way the most effective analgesic agent(s), route(s), and frequency of administration, as well as nonpharmacologic methods, can be determined for each child. Among those able to speak, pain estimation is usually easily accomplished. In infants and those intubated for supported ventilation, however, the task is more difficult. Nevertheless, careful observation of physiologic signs such as heart rate and blood pressure, facial expressions, body movement and position, and the quality of an infant's cries may in sum be sufficient to evaluate the intensity of pain. Monitoring of analgesic plasma levels to ascertain that they are within the ranges established for good analgesia and even determination of beta-endorphin blood levels may also aid in judging the adequacy of analgesia. By tailoring pain management methods to the needs of each child it may be possible to keep pain at acceptable levels in victims of burn injury.\r"

  ".W": "In the management of chronic pain conditions, the combination of pharmacologic measures with physical and psychologic modalities becomes even more important. A pain clinic and pain consultation service are one model that facilitates this combined approach. Initial management of mild to moderate pain begins with nonopioid analgesics such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Persistent severe pain of a neuropathic character merits careful trials of antidepressants or anticonvulsants. Traditionally, use of opioids for chronic pain not due to cancer has been discouraged for adults as well as children. Recently, this view was challenged by reports by Portenoy and Foley and by Taub, who followed a group of adults with chronic pain due to a variety of conditions. They found that the majority of these patients, if managed with opioids on a regular schedule as part of an overall treatment program, could be made comfortable and were able to increase their level of functioning for several years. In general, dosage escalation and compulsive drug-seeking behaviors were not seen. Since this report was retrospective and did not involve children, caution must be applied in extrapolating these findings to children. For example, remarkably little is known about the effects of chronic opioid administration in childhood on growth and development. Certainly, this issue deserves further study before general recommendations can be made. It seems prudent to emphasize the importance of maximizing nonpharmacologic and nonopioid approaches in the management of chronic pain in children prior to embarking on long-term use of opioids.\r"

  ".W": "A review of colic research supports the theory that colic may be caused by pain, particularly pain generated by gastrointestinal causes. At the same time, it also supports the view that disturbing crying in the first 3 months of life may be secondary to behavioral-interactive problems or simple parental misinterpretation of cry. In fact, a closer look at the methodology of colic studies along with our preliminary results suggest there may be at least two different patterns of disturbing infant crying. It is possible that one is associated with true pain and the other not. Dependence on retrospective parental reports alone to substantiate the presence of pain is only as reliable as parent interpretation of crying. Although specific cry patterns may represent specific infant conditions, parents may not be accurate interpreters of those patterns. In trying to determine the presence of gastrointestinal pain in colicky crying, close attention therefore should be given to the nature of the cry. Specific attention to qualitative and quantitative aspects of crying in colicky infants is identified as important by our pilot work. In the future this may help to explain the apparent discrepancies in the colic literature and to determine to what extent infant colic is a true pain syndrome.\r"

Mild and transient increases in creatinine and liver function tests and/or decreases in neutrophil count accompanied 77% of treatment courses but neutropenia (less than 1000 cells/mm3) did not occur. Transient decreases in platelet counts accompanied therapy in 3 bone marrow allograft recipients, but greater than 50% decrease in lymphocyte count was not seen.

However, in cases where imaging results are normal or equivocal, pancreatic function testing is necessary. Direct (intubation) tests are generally accepted as the best methods for study of pancreatic exocrine capacity, but indirect tests, which are well tolerated and generally simple to perform, are gaining interest. Their shortcoming is that they are too insensitive to reliably differentiate patients with early exocrine dysfunction (ie, before malabsorption has occurred) from controls. Sensitivity is not improved by combining two or more studies. However, several modified tests (eg, two-stage paraaminobenzoic acid test, pancreolauryl test) have improved specificity and are able to distinguish pancreatic from other causes of steatorrhea. Their reproducibility in individual cases is of value in sequential studies and in patients with established pancreatic exocrine deficiency to seek evidence of improvement or deterioration in function and to determine patient compliance with replacement therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The activity of an oncoprotein and the secretion of a pheromone can be affected by an unusual protein modification. Specifically, posttranslational modification of yeast a-factor and Ras protein requires an intermediate of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. This modification is apparently essential for biological activity. Studies of yeast mutants blocked in sterol biosynthesis demonstrated that the membrane association and biological activation of the yeast Ras2 protein require mevalonate, a precursor of sterols and other isoprenes such as farnesyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, drugs that inhibit mevalonate biosynthesis blocked the in vivo action of oncogenic derivatives of human Ras protein in the Xenopus oocyte assay. The same drugs and mutations also prevented the posttranslational processing and secretion of yeast a-factor, a peptide that is farnesylated. Thus, the mevalonate requirement for Ras activation may indicate that attachment of a mevalonate-derived (isoprenoid) moiety to Ras proteins is necessary for membrane association and biological function. These observations establish a connection between the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and transformation by the ras oncogene and offer a novel pharmacological approach to investigating, and possibly controlling, ras-mediated malignant transformations.\r"

Anabolic ornithine transcarbamoylase, a trimer of identical subunits, is not an allosteric enzyme per se. However, when the active-site residue arginine-106 of the Escherichia coli enzyme is replaced with a glycine through site-directed mutagenesis, the resultant mutant enzyme manifests substrate cooperativity that is absent in the wild-type enzyme. Both homotropic and heterotropic interactions occur in the mutant enzyme. The initial velocity saturation curves of the substrates, carbamoyl phosphate and L-ornithine, conform to the Hill equation. The observed cooperativity depends on substrate but not enzyme concentration. The finding underscores the possibility that a single mutation of the enzyme in the cell could turn transcarbamoylation into a regulatory junction in the biosynthesis of L-arginine and urea.\r"

In group 2 (n = 81), all of the tissue in the tracheoesophageal groove was removed routinely at total thyroidectomy and frozen section was done of the lymph nodes lying along the internal jugular vein. If metastases were found, a modified radical dissection of the neck was performed on the affected side. The two patient groups were comparable with regard to risk factors--local tumor stage, age and sex. Almost twice as many patients were found to have metastases to the lymph nodes in group 2. There was no significant difference in the ten year over-all or recurrence free survival time between the two groups. In group 1, there were more recurrences on the explored side of the neck but fewer distant metastases; however, both findings were not significant. In group 2, significantly more instances of hypoparathyroidism and palsy of the accessory nerve were found (p less than 0.05). Thus, when a more extensive search was carried out, more metastases to the lymph node were discovered and treated, but this did not prevent recurrences in the neck nor did it improve survival time. This approach resulted in more postoperative morbidity. There seems to be no justification for prophylactic removal of regional lymph nodes in instances of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland, but modified radical neck dissection may be beneficial if clinically suspect regional lymph nodes are present in the lateral part of the neck.\r"

There was no operative mortality, and the morbidity rate was 15 per cent. No instances of postoperative hepatic insufficiency were observed. Only five of the repeat hepatectomies were extensive (three or more hepatic segments). Thirteen resections were performed upon 11 patients for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. Four of these patients are still alive, one patient with a known recurrence (a mean survival time of 33 months with a range of four to 54 months). Ten resections were performed upon nine patients for recurrent metastases from the colon and rectum. Five of these patients are alive, four without apparent recurrence (a mean survival time of 13 months and a range of one to 35 months). Eleven resections were performed upon eight patients for recurrent miscellaneous malignant tumors, and four patients are alive, of whom three have a recurrence. The results of this study demonstrate that some patients benefit from repeat hepatectomy for recurrence of malignant hepatic tumors. Repeat hepatectomy is technically highly feasible. Economic hepatic resection with a sound oncologic basis (segmentectomy) is the operation of choice.\r"

We report herein 11 vascular injuries secondary to orthopedic procedures encountered between 1978 and 1988. Two injuries occurred as a consequence of lumbar laminectomy, three as a result of total hip replacement, three secondary to open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of a lower extremity, two secondary to attempted closed reduction of humeral fractures and one injury as a result of hip flexion contracture release. Injury occurred to three iliac arteries, three popliteal arteries, two brachial arteries, one femoral artery, one graft to femoral anastomosis and two iliac veins. Five arterial injuries were repaired primarily, one with a vein patch, while five required bypass grafts. One venous injury was repaired primarily and the other required placement of a Greenfield filter for thrombosis. Major complications were a result of diagnostic delay and subsequent ischemia in most patients. There were no deaths. We conclude that vascular injuries can occur as a result of laceration, compression or traction during orthopedic procedures as a result of the proximity of vascular structures to the spine, joints and long bones. Also, we conclude that injuries manifest themselves primarily as hemorrhage or ischemia; that excellent results can be obtained with prompt recognition and treatment; that angiography is useful in those with mild ischemia in whom diagnosis is delayed, and that preoperative documentation of the vascular status of patients is critical prior to orthopedic procedures.\r"

During the three year period ending August 1987, 317 consecutive patients undergoing celiotomy for penetrating abdominal trauma were prospectively randomized to receive either mezlocillin, 4 grams every six hours, or clindamycin, 600 milligrams every six hours, and gentamicin, loading dose of 2.0 milligrams per kilogram, then 1.5 kilograms every eight hours. Antibiotics were begun in the emergency department with duration of coverage based on the pattern of injury: the colon, five days; other hollow visceral injury, two days, and all others, one day. Twenty-three patients were excluded because of breach of protocol and 16 others died within 72 hours of presentation. The two study groups, 136 patients receiving mezlocillin and 142 patients receiving gentamicin and clindamycin, were comparable with respect to age, sex, mechanism of injury, shock, intraoperative replacement of blood, abdominal trauma index and distribution of hollow visceral injuries. The over-all incidence of septic morbidity was similar: infections developed in 21 (15 per cent) of the patients receiving mezlocillin compared with 19 (13 per cent) of patients receiving gentamicin and clindamycin. There was no significant difference in major infections (lobar pneumonia and intra-abdominal abscess), with 13 per cent in each group. The offending pathogens were similar. The most common isolates in intra-abdominal abscess were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Enterococcus species and anaerobic Bacteroides species. Mezlocillin, an extended spectrum penicillin, achieved similar results, compared with the expensive and potentially toxic combination regimen in patients with penetrating abdominal injuries.\r"

  ".W": "While changes in blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery relative to rest were assessed by transcranial Doppler sonography, 70 volunteers with no sign of cerebrovascular disease performed two (left and right middle cerebral artery) series of six cognitive tasks. The tasks are assumed to be processed predominantly by either the left (verbal and mathematical tests performed aloud) or the right hemisphere (dot/distance estimation, spatial perception, and face recognition performed silently). All tasks were shown to increase middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity on both sides, by 1.6-10.6%. After an initial maximum at approximately 8 seconds, velocity decreased then increased again. A steady state was reached after approximately 24-42 seconds. The initial minimum during the following rest phase was reached some seconds later, followed by a slow increase to the reference rest steady state. A difference according to side could be determined only during the three right-hemispheric tasks (right greater than left, 2.5-2.9%). Left-handedness/ambidexterity, familial sinistrality, and profession seemed to have no influence on the results. The middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity increase on both sides was higher in women than in men during the dot/distance estimation and was also higher bilaterally in older than in younger subjects during the dot/distance and the spatial perception tasks. Habituation in performing the tasks was an important factor associated with a decrease of blood flow velocity, especially in the right middle cerebral artery. The habituation more pronounced on the right side possibly reflects the role of the right hemisphere in attention and arousal. The absolute blood velocities at rest decreased bilaterally with age.\r"

Among these 102 patients, 50 presented with complete carotid artery occlusions and 52 with carotid artery diameter stenoses of greater than or equal to 60%. Mean +/- SD Doppler ophthalmic artery pressure was 69 +/- 15 mm Hg ipsilateral to the occlusion and 86 +/- 18 mm Hg ipsilateral to a stenosis of the carotid artery (p less than 0.001). The mean +/- SD Doppler ophthalmic pressure index (ratio of the ophthalmic artery to systemic blood pressure) was lower ipsilateral to the occlusion (0.46 +/- 0.08) than ipsilateral to a carotid artery stenosis (0.54 +/- 0.08; p less than 0.001); in both, the index was clearly diminished compared with normal values (0.68 +/- 0.04; p less than 0.001). It is concluded that the intracranial hemodynamic consequences in the patients with occlusion are on average more profound than in the patients with stenosis. In carotid artery occlusions, the mean +/- SD ipsilateral ophthalmic pressure index was 0.46 +/- 0.06 for antegrade and 0.46 +/- 0.09 for retrograde ophthalmic artery blood flow. In carotid artery stenoses, the mean +/- SD ipsilateral ophthalmic pressure index was 0.55 +/- 0.07 for antegrade and 0.48 +/- 0.06 for retrograde ophthalmic artery blood flow (p less than 0.01). These results indicate that in carotid stenoses the collateral capacity of the ophthalmic artery is insufficient compared with intracranial collaterals, while in carotid occlusions the blood flow direction in the ophthalmic artery does not predict intracranial hemodynamic compensation.\r"

Since these changes can be caused by a decreased density of perfused brain capillaries, we used 30 adult male Wistar rats to study the effect of acute and chronic hyperglycemia on 1) the brain intravascular space using radioiodinated albumin, 2) the anatomic density of brain capillaries using alkaline phosphatase histochemistry, and 3) the fraction of brain capillaries that are perfused using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran method. Our results indicate that acute and chronic hyperglycemia do not affect the brain intravascular space nor the anatomic density of brain capillaries. Also, there were no differences in capillary recruitment among normoglycemic, acutely hyperglycemic, and chronically hyperglycemic rats. These results suggest that the shrinkage of the brain L-glucose space in chronic hyperglycemia is more likely due to changes in the blood-brain barrier permeability to L-glucose.\r"

Subtraction images demonstrated the region of perfusion deficit as early as 1 hour after occlusion, earlier than conventional T2-weighted images. The area of altered perfusion detected by this technique (subtraction imaging after AMI-25 administration) correlated with that demonstrated by iodoantipyrine autoradiography. Since this magnetic resonance technique can be used to serially estimate the location and size of the ischemic area, the technique can be an important adjunct to metabolic studies of focal ischemia using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The technique may have clinical applications as well.\r"

  ".W": "This study assesses the effect of dietary supplements with high dose omega-3 fatty acid (N3FA) on the frequency of clinical restenosis during the 6 months after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). One hundred ninety-four patients (214 significant coronary narrowings) were randomized after successful PTCA to receive conventional medical therapy or to an identical regimen supplemented by high dose N3FA (4.5 g/day). Enrollment required angina pectoris and successful dilatation of all significant coronary narrowings. The subjects were randomly assigned to either no N3FA (control, n = 99) or N3FA supplementation (n = 95). After a 1-week trial period, 11 (group 2) declined further treatment because of side effects. The remaining 84 subjects (group 1) continued N3FA throughout the 6-month period. Monthly clinical follow-up was obtained in all patients. Ninety-two percent of patients had cardiac testing for evaluation of recurrent ischemia. Except for a greater percentage of women in the group refusing N3FA supplementation (group 2), the 3 groups were similar in demographic data, medical history, dietary habits, history of previous PTCA and angiographic characteristics. Of the 194 subjects, 56 had clinical restenosis (45 by cardiac catheterization, 8 by exercise testing and 3 by symptoms alone [refused further clinical testing]). Reocclusion rates were: group 1 19%, group 2 46%, and control 35%. Analysis both in accordance with the principle of intention to treat and for subjects who actually received N3FA revealed a significant effect of N3FA on preventing clinical restenosis (p less than 0.04 and p = 0.008, respectively). These data suggest that high dose N3FA supplements reduce the clinical restenosis rate after successful PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of intravenous propafenone (2 mg/kg) was assessed in 83 consecutive patients: 68 with atrial fibrillation (AF) and 15 with atrial flutter lasting less than 15 days. Conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 47 patients (57%), including 42 (62%) of those with AF and 5 (33%) of those with atrial flutter (p less than 0.05). The mean time to conversion was 29 +/- 24 minutes. The success rate was strongly affected by arrhythmia duration. Thus, conversion occurred in 40 patients (71%) among the 56 with arrhythmia lasting less than 48 hours but in 7 patients (26%) among the 27 with a longer lasting arrhythmia (p less than 0.0005). Left atrial size (determined echocardiographically in 56 patients) was significantly larger in nonconverters (49 +/- 12 vs 39 +/- 7 mm, p less than 0.0005). In nonconverters the mean ventricular rate decreased from 141 +/- 26 to 104 +/- 22 beats/min (p less than 0.0005). Except for reversible low output state in 3 patients already hemodynamically compromised, no significant side effects were observed. In conclusion, (1) intravenous propafenone allows a quick restoration of sinus rhythm in the majority of patients with AF of recent onset, whereas it seems less effective in atrial flutter; (2) its efficacy is influenced by the duration of the arrhythmia and by left atrial dimensions; (3) the drug allows control of ventricular rate; and (4) its use seems to be safe except in patients with severe cardiac failure.\r"

The possible role of viral infection in the genesis of CAD stimulated the review of 102 patients transplanted since the introduction of triple drug immunosuppression (cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisone) to assess the importance of posttransplant cytomegalovirus infection in the development of CAD in the cardiac graft. CAD occurred in 16 patients (16%). Recipient age and sex, donor age, pretransplant diagnosis, frequency of acute rejection episodes, HLA mismatch, cytomegalovirus infection, incidence of posttransplant systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and mean triglyceride, cholesterol and cyclosporine levels were analyzed to assess their influence on the development of CAD. Only the occurrence of cytomegalovirus infection was found to be a significant factor (p = 0.007): infection occurred in 62% of patients with CAD and in only 25% of those without. These data support the existence of an association between cytomegalovirus infection and CAD after cardiac transplant. It is possible that the virus contributes to the initial injury to the coronary endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "Enkephalins and endothelins are endogenous peptides, which, at least at pharmacologic doses, produce complex hemodynamic responses after intravenous administration. The enkephalins, when injected into conscious animal models and humans, increase blood pressure, heart rate and minute ventilation. This response occurs by activation of specific opiate receptors located outside the bloodbrain barrier; the actual mechanism involves an increase in adrenergic autonomic nervous system tone and a decrease in cholinergic tone. These opiate receptors may activate afferent fibers, perhaps nicotinic cholinoceptors; in many ways their properties are suggestive of chemoreceptors. Furthermore, enkephalin responses appear to be modulated by gamma-aminobutyric acid complexes, in that the reversal of the excitatory hemodynamic responses seen in the conscious state to vasodepressor responses after barbiturate anesthesia may result from alteration of the state of activation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid complex. The enkephalin receptors are localized to the vertebral artery vascular distribution; the specific site may be the area postrema, a blood-brain barrier-deficient circum-ventricular organ demonstrated to modulate heart rate and blood pressure and to represent a target site for circulating angiotensin II. Endothelin increases heart rate and blood pressure when infused slowly into conscious or anesthetized dogs, although barbiturates do blunt the increase in heart rate. The mechanism appears to involve modification of autonomic tone, but also some element of direct vasoconstrictor activity. Interestingly, rapid bolus doses of endothelin produce only vasodepressor responses, suggesting that the rate and concentration at which circulating endothelin reaches afferent receptors or vasoconstrictor sites on vascular smooth muscle may determine the net hemodynamic response observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Urapidil, a phenylpiperazine-substituted derivative of uracil, is a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist and therefore decreases blood pressure and peripheral resistance. Apart from its alpha 1-adrenoceptor-blocking potency, which is somewhat less selective than that of prazosin, urapidil appeared to display substantial central hypotensive activity. Initially, this central mechanism was assumed to be the same as that of clonidine, i.e., agonistic activity toward central alpha 2 adrenoceptors. This view, however, appeared to be incorrect for the following reasons: (1) In radioligand binding studies urapidil did not show any affinity for alpha 2 adrenoceptors; and (2) the central hypotensive activity of urapidil, injected into feline vertebral arteries remained unaffected by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor-blocking agents yohimbine and rauwolscine, which are known to suppress the central hypotensive effect of clonidine. The central hypotensive effect of urapidil so far remains unknown in detail, although a few (but not all) experimental arguments would plead for the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT 1A)-agonistic potency of urapidil as an explanation of its central activity. The central hypotensive mechanism of urapidil will be discussed in more detail later in this issue. A presynaptic alpha 2-agonistic activity can only be demonstrated in certain models but not in the classic pithed rat preparation. It is unlikely to play a relevant role in urapidil's hypotensive activity, and also because of the poor affinity of the drug for alpha 2 adrenoceptors. Finally, a weak beta 1-adrenoceptor activity of urapidil can be demonstrated, but this mechanism is unlikely to contribute significantly to the drug's hypotensive activity.\r"

  ".W": "Investigations in animals indicate that urapidil has a number of actions that may be relevant to its antihypertensive effect. It has an alpha 1-blocking action, a weak beta 1-blocking effect, an interaction with a serotonin receptor and a central depression of sympathetic tone. Urapidil is well absorbed orally with a bioavailability of about 70% and a time to peak concentration of about 4 hours after a sustained release capsule. It is metabolized in the liver at a half-life of 4.7 hours. Peripheral alpha 1-blocking activity has been demonstrated in humans. A shift to the right in the dose-response curve to phenylephrine has been found after urapidil, whereas responses to angiotensin are not affected. Evidence for beta 1-blocking activity is marginal. Urapidil does not inhibit the exercise increase in heart rate. Some investigators have suggested a possible inhibition of isoprenaline tachycardia; others have found no evidence. There is some evidence suggestive of a central action of urapidil in humans as lower single doses result in a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. With higher doses the hypotensive effect continues but the tachycardia no longer occurs. However, urapidil has been reported to increase noradrenaline levels, although there has been a report with a high dose reducing vanillylmandelic acid excretion. Evidence for changes in renin is inconsistent. Hemodynamic studies have revealed findings that are compatible with peripheral alpha 1 blockade. After intravenous administration, peripheral resistance is reduced along with arterial pressure, and cardiac output is increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This is mainly mediated by a peripheral alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance; in addition, during acute animal experiments a centrally mediated hypotensive action was demonstrated, possibly by 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A)-receptor stimulation. Studies in humans showed an increase in cardiac output, which was not always significant; it did result either from an increased heart rate or an increased stroke volume. Acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics after administration of urapidil were most pronounced in patients with pulmonary hypertension: pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased nonsignificantly. A small reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and capillary wedge pressure were seen in patients with congestive heart failure and in patients in whom acute blood pressure elevation developed after coronary bypass surgery. In patients with essential hypertension forearm, renal and splanchnic flow were shown to increase and vascular resistance to decrease significantly after acute intravenous doses of urapidil. The hemodynamic changes during chronic therapy are largely unknown, except for systemic vascular resistance which remains decreased.\r"

To evaluate the acute effects of this drug on renal vascular tone and on pressor systems a randomized placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted in 10 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Each subject received, on 2 separate days 1 week apart, an intravenous injection of either placebo or urapidil (25 or, if necessary, 50 mg). Before and after this injection blood pressure and heart rate (Dinamap), renal plasma flow (125I-hippuran), active plasma renin concentration, angiotensin II, aldosterone and catecholamines in plasma were measured. The results show that urapidil, when compared with placebo, greatly reduced blood pressure, while increasing heart rate, renal blood flow, and noradrenaline and adrenaline levels. However, dopamine levels were suppressed. Whereas renin and angiotensin II were only mildly stimulated, aldosterone levels increased significantly. It is concluded that urapidil, given intravenously, has an immediate blood pressure-lowering effect associated with a decrease in renal vascular tone and an increase in renal perfusion. Consequently, both the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems are stimulated, although the latter only to a mild degree. The increase in aldosterone may be partially related to the decrease in dopamine levels.\r"

After a 2-week washout and placebo phase, 295 essential hypertensive patients (World Health Organization grades I and II) were treated for 12 weeks with either urapidil or captopril, initially with urapidil, 60 mg twice daily or captopril, 25 mg twice daily, with the possibility of adjusting the dose according to blood pressure response after 2 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure values at the end of the 12-week treatment decreased significantly in the group receiving urapidil (n = 142, all dosages), from 175/103 to 154/89 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and in the group receiving captopril (n = 153, all dosages) from 175/103 to 154/90 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); these values corresponded to 62% urapidil and 58% captopril responder rates (diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg), respectively. The computer-assisted frequency distribution of the patients with controlled diastolic blood pressure (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) over the duration of the study demonstrated comparable efficacy for both drugs. Adverse effects were observed in 45 patients in the urapidil group and in 18 patients in the captopril group (vertigo, nausea, headache). The results revealed that the 2 antihypertensive agents with different modes of action controlled blood pressure with equal efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In general, the treatment should start with 60 mg twice daily, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 in the evening. This schedule may be adapted according to the therapeutic needs. During the last few years, urapidil has been investigated extensively in comparison with several types of established antihypertensive drugs. Urapidil given orally has been tested in comparative trials against placebo, acebutolol, metoprolol, captopril, nifedipine and nitrendipine with responder rates of 40 to 70%. These responder rates are to be expected for a variety of antihypertensive drugs in monotherapy. Further studies with clonidine, prazosin and alpha-methyldopa showed similar responder rates as established for the other antihypertensive drugs studied. Adverse reactions include dizziness, headache and nausea and occasionally tiredness, orthostatic dysregulation and gastric disorders. These symptoms were transient, mostly occurring during the early phases of therapy and disappearing as treatment continued. Adverse effects are considered to be mainly due to blood pressure reduction. Intravenous comparative trials have been performed with urapidil against placebo, diazoxide and sodium nitroprusside. Adverse effects of parenterally applied urapidil are similar to those observed during oral treatment. Specific contraindications for urapidil are unknown. However, as for other vasodilating drugs, intravenous urapidil should not be administered to patients with stenosis of the aortic isthmus or with aortic valve insufficiency.\r"

This hypothesis was tested by analyzing the influence of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist spiroxatrine on the hypotensive responses to urapidil and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Chloralose/urethane-anesthetized cats underwent thoracotomy and were artificially ventilated. Blood pressure was monitored in the femoral artery. Urapidil (0.01 to 10 mumol/kg) or 8-OH-DPAT (3 to 30 nmol/kg) was injected into a femoral vein and the maximal hypotensive response recorded. A dose-response test with both drugs was performed before and after administration of spiroxatrine (3 and 10 nmol/kg); the latter was given through the vertebral artery, thus delivering the antagonist to the brain stem. Blood pressure was dose-dependently reduced by urapidil and 8-OH-DPAT after intravenous injection. Central administration of spiroxatrine through the vertebral artery shifted the dose-response curves of both drugs markedly and in a dose-dependent manner to the right, while the hypotensive response to the peripheral vasodilator nitroglycerin remained unchanged. The results suggest that the hypotensive response after peripheral administration of urapidil is mediated in part by stimulation of brain 5-HT1A receptors and this effect on central cardiovascular regulation is additive to the blood pressure reduction resulting from peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor blockade.\r"

Both diets provided an average of 1200 kcal/d over a 12-wk period; daily intake of subjects in the alternating-diet condition varied in a prescribed pattern from 600 to 1800 kcal/d. Exercising subjects walked 5 d/wk. All subjects participated in an intensive outpatient behavior-modification program. At the end of the study, exercised subjects had greater reductions in body weight and body fat percentage than did nonexercised subjects. The type of caloric restriction did not affect weight or fat loss. Changes in resting metabolic rate did not differ among groups. Alternating calories was neither beneficial nor detrimental as a weight-loss strategy whereas exercise was clearly beneficial in weight-loss therapy.\r"

The relationships between three indicators of fat distribution (waist-hip, waist-thigh, and subscapular-triceps ratios) and hormonal and metabolic variables were studied. Increased androgenic activity (ratio of free testosterone [T] to total testosterone [free-total T ratio]) and degree of obesity (BMI) were independently related to increased waist-hip ratio. Waist-hip and waist-thigh ratios showed higher correlations with all metabolic variables than did the triceps-subscapular skinfold thickness ratio except for diastolic blood pressure. After adjustment for BMI and free-total T ratio, the waist-hip ratio was still significantly positively related to total cholesterol and C peptide and negatively to the HDL-total cholesterol ratio. In such multiple regression, BMI was independently related to insulin, C peptide, and diastolic blood pressure. The free-total T ratio was independently related to triglycerides. BMI and waist-hip ratio gave important complementary information about risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus.\r"

Eighteen healthy subjects randomly assigned received three different starches under one form of conditioning. All products were submitted to in vitro alpha-amylolysis. Raw manihot starch produced the lowest (p less than 0.05) metabolic responses. Cooking significantly (p less than 0.01) increased plasma responses. However, cooked mung bean noodles gave metabolic responses similar to those of raw products. Close correlations were found between percentages of in vitro starch hydrolysis at 30 min and mean areas under the glycemic curves and the insulinemic curves (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001).\r"

Some studies suggest that folic acid supplements interfere with intestinal zinc absorption in humans and animals but others do not confirm such an effect. The weight of current evidence favors the view that daily supplements of 5-15 mg folic acid do not have significant adverse effects on Zn nutriture in healthy nonpregnant subjects. Because antifolate medications are now being used to treat a wide range of malignant and nonmalignant disorders, further investigation is needed concerning folate metabolism and the safety of supplements in patients with these disorders.\r"

The authors studied two such tumors, which occurred in 63- and 69-year-old patients. One of them had osseous metastases develop, which were treated unsuccessfully by irradiation and diethylstilbestrol therapy. The other patient is free of disease 15 months after radical prostatectomy. Both tumors contained an intimate mixture of carcinoma and sarcoma; patient 1 displayed foci of chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma, whereas patient 2 exhibited areas of chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and angiosarcoma. The phenotypic nature of these tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemical studies, showing reactivity for vimentin, S-100 protein, desmin, actin, myoglobin, or Ulex europaeus I agglutinin. Conversely, the sarcomatous components lacked prostate-specific antigen, epithelial membrane antigen, and cytokeratin, whereas carcinomatous elements expressed these three markers. The authors' data support the existence of true carcinosarcomas of the prostate, that is, malignant neoplasms with conjoint epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. The question of whether prostatic carcinosarcoma is an entity that is totally distinct from sarcomatoid or metaplastic carcinoma remains problematic.\r"

Immunohistochemical staining of 15 small cell carcinomas, one-third of which were associated with hypercalcemia, 15 adult granulosa cell tumors, 15 juvenile granulosa cell tumors, and 5 Sertoli cell tumors, was performed with the use of antibodies against cytokeratins (AE-1/AE-3, CAM 5.2, 902), epithelial tumor-associated antigens (B72.3, epithelial membrane antigen [EMA]), vimentin, S-100, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), lysozyme, parathyroid hormone, and chromogranin-A in an attempt to define histogenetically this tumor type. One-third of the small cell carcinomas were positive for EMA, whereas all of them were negative for B72.3 and S-100. In contrast, one-third of the granulosa cell tumors were positive for S-100 and all of them were negative for EMA and B72.3. One of five Sertoli cell tumors were positive for EMA and two were positive for B72.3, but all were negative for S-100. Differences existed in the frequency, intensity, and/or pattern of staining for cytokeratin, vimentin, lysozyme, and NSE among the various tumor types. A single small cell carcinoma from a patient with hypercalcemia stained focally for parathyroid hormone, whereas all 30 granulosa cell tumors and 4 of 5 Sertoli cell tumors were nonreactive. Chromogranin-A staining was noted in four of five small cell carcinomas, none of ten granulosa cell tumors, and two of five Sertoli cell tumors. These immunohistochemical findings, as well as previous light and electron microscopic data, do not clearly indicate any specific cell as the cell of origin of the ovarian small cell carcinoma.\r"

Data were evaluated in relationship to the morphologic and immunophenotypic heterogeneity of NHL at diagnosis and in progressive advanced diseases. Increased sIL-2R levels were found in most cases, when compared with levels observed in healthy controls. No obvious statistical correlation has been observed between sIL-2R values in different NHL subtypes as defined by current classifications. On the other hand, major significance was related to the extent of the disease. Very high values, comparable to those observed in hairy cell leukemia, were observed in a number of large cell NHLs complicating low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferations and in a single case of T-cell Kil+ NHL. The authors' findings suggest that the detection of sIL-2R in NHL may represent a good marker in improving risk assignment of single cases and/or for monitoring remissions and exacerbations during the treatment of cases with very high levels at diagnosis. Nevertheless, the observed overlap between groups on an individual case basis can render the clinical application of this marker problematic.\r"

Fifty-one culture-positive patients, aged 6 months to 9 years, were included, 26 in the amoxicillin group and 25 in the Augmentin group. The study groups were clinically and bacteriologically comparable at the start of the study. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from all patients and beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 14 (29%). All staphylococci were sensitive to Augmentin but resistant to amoxicillin. Forty-nine patients completed the study. The clinical response was significantly better among the Augmentin recipients (marked improvement in 71% and 95% of patients after 2 and 5 days, respectively; no new lesions during the treatment course) than among the amoxicillin recipients (marked improvement in 44% and 68% of patients after 2 and 5 days, respectively; new lesions appeared in 20% of patients). Recurrence within 3 weeks occurred in 12 (26%) of 49 patients, and no difference was observed between the two groups. We conclude that S aureus is common in nonbullous impetigo, and that at least in some cases it plays an important role in the course of the disease that can be altered by specific therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is a common inherited disorder of iron metabolism characterized by excessive iron absorption and the toxic accumulation of iron in parenchymal cells. Homozygous inheritance of an abnormality on chromosome 6 causes this disorder by increasing the intestinal absorption of iron, which is slowly deposited in parenchymal cells of the liver, heart, pancreas, and other endocrine organs. Symptoms develop only after the marked accumulation of iron stores develop, which causes functional insufficiency of these organs. The symptoms are often variable, nonspecific, and attributed to other diseases. Early diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and an awareness of the clinical features of HHC. Serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin levels are useful screening studies, but liver biopsy with quantitative chemical determination of iron concentration is essential to evaluate histopathological changes and to help distinguish hereditary hemochromatosis from secondary iron overload. Treatment with weekly phlebotomy frequently results in some clinical improvement in patients with established disease, and if initiated early, organ damage can be prevented and a normal life-span can be expected. The hereditary nature of the disease mandates familial screening of index cases.\r"

Fifty-eight patients were classified according to the pattern of blood loss: 14 patients with chronic occult, 28 patients with recurrent acute, and 16 patients with acute bleeding. The sensitivity and specificity of mesenteric angiography for each group was: chronic occult, 40% sensitivity and 100% specificity; recurrent acute, 30% sensitivity and 100% specificity; acute, 47% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Vascular lesions accounted for most of the diagnosed abnormalities, including four of five lesions in patients with chronic blood loss and four of six lesions in each of the groups with recurrent acute and acute bleeding. A positive angiogram was correlated with a high likelihood of surgery in patients with recurrent acute as well as acute hemorrhage. Five of six in the former group and six of seven in the latter group required an operative procedure. Mesenteric angiography is an integral part of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, although the frequency of positivity varies with the pattern of bleeding.\r"

Nine patients with less than 3 spontaneous bowel movements/wk were studied. After passing a tube to the cecum, 50 muCi of 111In-DTPA were instilled into the cecum and followed for 48 h using colonic transit scintigraphy. In the group as a whole, cisapride had little effect on transit. The patients were then divided into two groups based on transit: functional rectosigmoid obstruction (FRSO) and colonic inertia (CI). In the CI group, cisapride accelerated the half emptying time of the cecum and ascending colon from 2.50 to 1.21 h (p less than 0.05). The progression of the geometric center was also faster after cisapride in CI. In FRSO, the geometric center was unchanged by cisapride except at 48 h. Cisapride thus has a prokinetic effect on colonic transit in patients with severe idiopathic constipation, colonic inertia subtype. It may be a useful agent in the treatment of this group of patients.\r"

In these patients, 24 major and 55 minor liver resections were performed. Six of these patients (7.6%) died within 30 days after the operation. In one-third of the patients, complications occurred.

Spontaneous hepatofugal flow in one or more of the three vessels examined was detected in 14 patients. Spontaneous hepatofugal flow in the portal trunk was detected in three patients with liver cirrhosis. In two of these three patients, the hepatofugal flow in the portal trunk disappeared after medication. This is interesting, since hepatofugal flow may, in fact, be more common than we suspected in patients who, because of the severity of their disease, are not able to undergo invasive examination. Postoperative hepatofugal flow in the portal system was detected in 20 of 71 cases: 15/17 patients after interposition mesocaval shunting, 2/17 after distal splenorenal shunting, 2/31 after splenectomy, and 1/6 after splenic artery occlusion with steel coils. In more than half the cases of interposition mesocaval shunting (9/17 patients), blood flow in the portal trunk was hepatofugal. However, hepatopetal blood flow in the portal trunk was maintained in most cases of distal splenorenal shunting (13/17), showing the merits of this technique as a selective portosystemic shunt operation.\r"

  ".W": "Studies are presented on a 62-yr-old woman with extreme hepatomegaly due to a giant hemangioma with alterations in the clotting system indicating a consumption coagulopathy. There was a fall of hemoglobin, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, and platelet number after arteriography of the truncus celiacus. Furthermore, there was sustained bleeding in the patient's right thigh caused by puncture of the arteria femoralis. Continuous administration of iv heparin corrected the clotting disorder including a rise in platelets from 95,000/microliters to 148,000/microliters, permitting surgical removement of the hematoma. Celiacography is a useful tool for the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomata, as well as ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Being an invasive technique, it requires testing for possible consumption coagulopathy if used in patients with hemangiomatosis. Its application should be restricted to cases in which exact diagnosis cannot be established by other means.\r"

Screening with conventional noninvasive techniques is limited by the poor exercise capacity of these patients. This study evaluated the accuracy of digital subtraction fluorography in detecting coronary calcification as a noninvasive, nonexercise screening test for coronary artery disease. Eighty-six patients under evaluation for renal transplantation and considered at increased risk of coronary artery disease were studied by coronary arteriography and digital subtraction fluorography for coronary calcification. Significant coronary disease (greater than or equal to 50% obstruction in at least one vessel) was present in 36 (42%) patients. The detection of coronary calcification by digital subtraction fluorography had a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 66%. The probability of disease being present in the absence of coronary calcification in this group was 18%. The detection of coronary calcification by digital subtraction fluorography appears to be a satisfactory and inexpensive screening test in this setting.\r"

The clinical and pathological features of ten patients with de novo MGN were studied and the related literature was reviewed to assess the clinical features, morphologic characteristics, and natural course of this disease. De novo MGN may occur in both living related and cadaveric allografts at any time after transplantation. It presents clinically either as asymptomatic proteinuria or the nephrotic syndrome, a feature of poor prognostic implication. Morphologically, de novo MGN in most instances has distinct differences from idiopathic MGN in native kidneys and is accompanied by varying features of rejection. About 50% of grafts which develop de novo MGN eventually fail. This rather poor outcome may not represent the natural history of de novo MGN per se but rather the consequences of associated chronic rejection. Evidence is presented that many of the cases of so-called de novo MGN may be a complication of transplant glomerulopathy rather than being caused by mechanisms totally independent from rejection.\r"

Although most dialyzers in current use are marketed as disposable items, the majority of dialysis facilities in the United States reprocess these devices and use them multiple times on the same patient. Recent studies have shown that certain reprocessing techniques confer improved biological properties on dialyzers compared with new membranes as prepared by manufacturers. Several studies have suggested that these biological properties may lead to improved clinical outcomes. However, critics of dialyzer reprocessing argue that it may expose patients to risks that produce increased morbidity and mortality. This article critically reviews the available scientific information regarding reprocessing hemodialyzers.\r"

Increased dialyzer prescription (Kt/V) was correlated with the need for a lower maintenance dose of r-HuEPO. After 1 year of therapy, stable increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte levels were obtained without other clinically significant hematologic changes. In a randomly selected subgroup of 14 patients, 5 developed predialysis increased diastolic pressures. In this group, an early increase in cardiac output and ejection fraction was accompanied by a decrease in total peripheral resistance index (TPRI). Later changes showed a steady increase in TPRI with an associated mild increase in mean arterial pressure. A slight increase in cardiac responsiveness to fistula occlusive maneuvers was also found. Hospital admissions and mortality rates were not significantly different from those of a cohort control population. At a fixed Kt/V there were slight decreases in solute clearances with correction of anemia, with phosphate, urate, and creatinine changing significantly. Corrective measures required simple compensatory adjustments in dialysis blood-flow rates. Intradialytic complications were noticeably improved. Patients receiving long-term r-HuEPO replacement therapy do remarkably well without major complications.\r"

  ".W": "Extensive testing has proven that recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO; EPOGEN [epoetin alfa], AMGEN Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA) corrects the anemia of end-stage renal disease and eliminates the need for transfusions in virtually all patients. Patients whose hematocrit levels are less than 0.30 or who are transfusion dependent are candidates for therapy. A dosage of 50 to 150 U/kg body weight intravenously three times a week produces an increase in hematocrit by approximately 0.01 to 0.02 per week. Once the hematocrit reaches 0.30 the dose is adjusted so that a target hematocrit of 0.32 to 0.38 is maintained. Eighty percent of patients need maintenance doses of r-HuEPO of less than or equal to 150 U/kg; the other 20% of patients require larger doses. Reasons for poor responses include iron deficiency, inflammation due to surgery or infection, and osteitis fibrosa. Most patients require iron supplementation to prevent functional iron deficiency. BP increased in one third of patients, and in 3% seizures occurred during the initial phase of therapy, often associated with a sudden increase in BP. This hypertension can be controlled with medication. Increased dialyzer clotting may occur, which is prevented when heparin doses are adjusted, and dialyzer solute clearances may decrease slightly. Treatment with r-HuEPO does not elicit an antibody response. The mechanism of action of r-HuEPO is identical to that of natural erythropoietin, and therefore is an appropriate therapy for the long-term management of anemia in chronic renal failure.\r"

The literature contains at least 36 similar examples of an association between pigmentary anomalies and chromosomal mosaicism, as well as five examples of an association with chimerism. The pigmentary anomalies are pleomorphic, and the chromosomal anomalies involve autosomes and sex chromosomes. The pigmentation patterns are reminiscent of the archetypal paradigm seen in allophenic mice and demonstrate the clonal origin of melanoblasts from neural crest precursors. Patients with anomalous skin pigmentation, particularly when it follows a pattern of Blaschko lines, should be appropriately evaluated for a possible association with chromosomal or genetic mosaicism or chimerism.\r"

The use of molecular probes provided informed genetic counseling to the family for the first time. With the DNA markers from 5p, prenatal diagnosis was performed on two fetal chorionic villus samples, both of which were found to have unbalanced karyotypes. The identification of translocation carriers was complicated by recombination between the small translocated segment of 5p and the corresponding region on the normal homologue, which changed the haplotype of the translocated 5p segment.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated in the pathology of experimental malaria. To establish its relevance to human malaria, we studied serum levels of two monocyte-derived cytokines, TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as of the lymphocyte-derived mediator interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in patients with malaria before and during antiparasitic treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty serum samples of 40 patients with malaria (Plasmodium falciparum [n = 32], Plasmodium vivax [n = 8]) were analyzed. IL-6 was measured by a highly sensitive and specific bioassay, TNF-alpha by immunoradiometric assay, and IFN-gamma by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Elevated cytokine levels could be detected in the majority of patients with P. falciparum malaria before treatment (31 of 32, 21 of 32, and 21 of 32 for TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IFN-gamma, respectively), but only in some patients with P. vivax malaria (four of eight, one of eight, and zero of eight for TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IFN-gamma, respectively). Serum concentrations of the monokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 correlated significantly with parasitic density (p less than 0.001). No such correlation was obtained with the circulating IFN-gamma concentration. The levels of monokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 were markedly elevated in 18 P. falciparum-infected patients with complicated clinical courses (median values for TNF-alpha 172 pg/mL, for IL-6 16 U/mL, peak values: 896 pg/mL and 1,000 U/mL, respectively). The correlation between TNF-alpha and IL-6 concentrations in serum (n = 40, r = 0.56, p = 0.0002) suggests co-ordinate production of those mediators. CONCLUSION: Organ impairment in human malaria was found to be correlated with the amount of circulating cytokine levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Thus, imbalances of the cytokine network in untreated P. falciparum infection serve as markers of severity of disease. Modulation of cytokine response could represent a novel approach to the treatment of severe organ dysfunctions in human malaria.\r"

A marked increase was noted in the incidence of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy as an indication for penetrating keratoplasty beginning in 1985. The association of anterior chamber intraocular lenses in eyes with pseudophakic bullous keratopathy undergoing penetrating keratoplasty increased from 19 of 43 cases (44%) in 1983 to 79 of 108 cases (73%) in 1988. The incidence of intraocular lens exchange at the time of penetrating keratoplasty in cases of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy increased from six of 43 (14%) in 1983 to 63 of 108 (58%) in 1988. Other major indications for penetrating keratoplasty included Fuchs' dystrophy (375 cases, 16%), keratoconus (348 cases, 15%), aphakic bullous keratopathy (331 cases, 14%), and regraft (233 cases, 10%). Cataract extraction, with or without intraocular lens implantation, was combined with penetrating keratoplasty in 397 of 1,532 phakic eyes (26%). The incidence of triple procedure (penetrating keratoplasty, cataract extraction, and intraocular lens implantation) increased from 27 of 248 phakic eyes (11%) in 1983 to 68 of 258 phakic eyes (26%) in 1988.\r"

Ten eyes (10%) required additional surgery for a secondary membrane, 12 eyes (11%) developed glaucoma, and one (1%) developed a retinal detachment. Patients who underwent surgery by 8 weeks of age had a significantly greater number of complications (P less than .025). Patients undergoing cataract surgery early in life should be routinely examined for possible postoperative glaucoma.

  ".W": "To investigate the basic mechanisms of granuloma formation, in vitro granulomas were induced by culturing murine spleen cells in the presence of artificial microparticles. Large granulomas developed around dextran beads. The lesions were inducible by spleen cells from either normal mice or athymic nude mice. Minimal inflammation was produced around latex beads. The histologic features and time kinetics of granulomas in vitro. Culture supernatants of dextran induced granulomas contained high levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity but not interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interleukin-4 (IL-4) activity. IL-1 activity was correlated with granuloma size. Additionally, granulomas were produced by culturing spleen cells in the presence of agarose beads coupled to recombinant IL-1 or recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Granulomatous lesions also were induced by macrophage-enriched populations in the presence of monokine-coupled beads. Adherent macrophages, but not nonadherent cells, were required for induction of granulomas in vitro. In contrast, very small lesions were seen when spleen cells or adherent cells were cultured in the presence of beads coupled to recombinant IL-2 or recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). These results suggest that macrophages and monokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha play an essential role in granuloma formation in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have localized elastase in human blood and bone marrow neutrophils by immunoelectron microscopy using a monoclonal anti-human elastase antibody (NP 57) and compared its distribution with myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoferrin (LF), which mark primary and secondary neutrophil granule, respectively. Human bone marrow and blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), either unstimulated or after phagocytosis of latex microbeads, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Ultrathin frozen sections were immunolabeled with NP 57, followed by an immunogold probe. In bone marrow granulocyte precursors elastase appeared simultaneously in the immature first granules of myeloblasts with MPO. As these granules became denser with maturation, labeling for both enzymes became weaker and sometimes negative (possibly due to masking of immunoreactivity). The ellipsoidal primary granules were strongly labeled by NP57. LF positive granules appeared later, at the myelocyte stage, and contained neither MPO nor elastase. In mature neutrophils, immunolabeling for elastase was found together with MPO in the large electron-dense primary granules and in a different granule population from the LF-positive secondary granules. Double labeling with two different-sized gold particles was used to compare the kinetics of degranulation of secondary and primary granules. The observation and the analysis of single phagosome content was made possible by this new technique. In conclusion, immunoelectron microscopy was used to show elastase in the primary granules of neutrophils, where it appears simultaneously with MPO. This technique has also allowed comparison of the kinetics of degranulation of both types of granules, and could be applied to different experimental and pathologic conditions.\r"

The authors propose that hepatocellular and ductular carcinomas arise from a pluripotent liver stem cell and that enzyme-altered foci and nodular changes are adaptive non-oncogenic responses to the toxic effects of carcinogens. It is further postulated that persistent nodules may provide an environment that nurtures development of neoplastic cells other than the altered hepatocytes that originally form the nodule. It is possible, however, that there may be more than one cellular lineage to hepatocellular cancer and that persistent nodules contain these different lineages.\r"

The effectiveness of these various methods, many of which are based on sound scientific principles, has yet to be documented. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of five commonly used rehabilitation programs. Five groups of 20 patients, all of whom underwent the same method of ACL reconstruction, were compared in order to determine the effects of the following treatments (some in combination): transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), immobilization in flexion, immobilization in extension, electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), and continuous passive motion (CPM). Clinical evaluation, volumetric thigh measurements, instrumented varus-valgus stress testing, KT-1000 arthometer (Medmetric, San Diego, CA) measurements, and Cybex II (Cybex, Division of Lumex, Ronkonkoma, NY) muscle evaluation were used to examine the patients. TENS did not reduce the amount of pain medication required, nor was there improvement in any other clinically measurable parameter of performance. There was no clear difference in stability between those treated in extension and those treated in flexion; however, since three patients who were treated in extension required manipulation, there may be some advantage to treating patients with early limited range of motion in flexion. EMS did not reduce atrophy but it did minimize strength decrease during immobilization. EMS also resulted in significantly greater range of motion than those treated with extension or flexion with early limited motion. Compared to all groups, EMS patients had a significant reduction in the incidence of patellofemoral crepitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-eight animals were divided into five study groups: Group S received only a sham arthrotomy (without a meniscal incision), Groups P13 and P26 received peripheral medial meniscal incisions, and Groups R13 and R26 received radial medial meniscus incisions. All meniscal incisions were repaired anatomically with absorbable suture. Groups P13 and R13 were sacrificed at 13 weeks following surgery and Groups P26 and R26 at 26 weeks. Following sacrifice, the joints were subjected to gross and histologic examination, and structural and material properties testing. All meniscal repairs healed, and the peripheral repairs were virtually invisible, with no articular damage. The radial repairs healed with 3 to 5 mm wide fibrovascular scars, and several joints demonstrated articular erosions. The radial repair tissue contained unorganized collagen bundles and ground substance deficient in mucopolysaccharides. Groups S, P13 and P26 demonstrated no statistically significant differences between test and control limbs in compressive force-displacement behavior, input energy (EI), and ratio of dissipated to input energy (ED/EI). There were significant test-control differences in the load-displacement characteristics of Groups R13 (P less than 0.05) and R26 (P less than 0.05), with the repaired joint stiffer than the control. EI decreased 26% in Group R13 (not significant) and 34% in Group R26 (P less than 0.05), while the ratio ED/EI increased from 27% to 44% in Group R13 (not significant) and from 31% to 38% in Group R26 (P less than 0.05). Medial compartment contact area did not change significantly in either peripheral repair group, but decreased by 25% in Group R13 (P less than 0.05) and by 13% in Group R26 (P less than 0.05). Yield stress, maximum stress, and Young's modulus decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) relative to the controls in tensile tests of the radial repair tissue. There were no significant changes in these properties from 13 to 26 weeks. We concluded that in this animal model, the mechanical function of the meniscus is restored following repair of peripheral longitudinal lesions; however, it appears that in the radial repairs, progressive spreading at the repair site (filled by a fibrovascular scar) altered normal meniscal geometry and structure, adversely influencing mechanical function. Future studies may document whether protective measures (immobilization, limited weightbearing, etc.) can preserve normal mechanical function following repair of radial lesions.\r"

There are physiological, structural, and psychosocial differences which distinguish them as a unique entity in the athletic world. Despite the unavoidable alterations that the passage of time imposes on our bodies, these competitors are still capable of incredible performances of strength, skill, and endurance. In reference to injury, these athletes are at risk from both their current program and their past indiscretions. The literature strongly suggests that the greatest threat to the health of the aging athlete is not the aging process itself but rather inactivity. Astrand concurs with this and states that \"there is less risk in activity than in continuous inactivity--it is more advisable to pass a careful physical examination if one intends to be sedentary in order to establish whether one's state of health is good enough to stand the inactivity.\" It appears that the body systems were designed to reinforce activity and when there is disuse, a large number of atrophic changes take place. It has been estimated that regular exercise may be able to retard the physiologic decline associated with old age as much as 50%. Taken in this light, exercise is truly a fountain of youth from which we can all rejuvenate ourselves. Science has proven that life does not begin at 40, but it has also demonstrated that it does not have to end there. As one author so aptly states, \"Not too many years ago the words grandma and grandpa conjured images of rocking chairs and inactivity.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The femoral location was the primary determinant of whether the distance increased, decreased, or remained nearly constant. The proximal-distal location of a fiber's femoral attachment had a stronger effect than had the anterior-posterior location. The tibial location had only a small statistically significant effect. These results suggest that the function of fibers within the PCL is determined primarily by their femoral attachment location. We determined all femoral attachments whose tibio-femoral distance changed 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm during flexion from 0 degrees to 90 degrees. No absolutely isometric point existed. Attachments whose separation distance changed less than 2 mm formed a bullet-shaped region whose base was against the roof of the intercondylar notch and whose nose pointed posteriorly and slightly distally. The axis of the \"bullet\" was near the proximal edge of the femoral insertion of the PCL. Along the axis, anterior attachments, located near the roof of the intercondylar notch, were more isometric than were posterior attachments, located near the cartilage. Attachments located distal to the axis moved away from the tibial insertion of the PCL when the knee was flexed. The more distal the femoral attachment, the larger the increase in tibiofemoral distance that occurred with flexion. The opposite was true of attachments proximal to the 2 mm region.\r"

The change in distance during motion was described by the difference between the longest and shortest distances measured. Using knees from eight cadaver donors, we studied the effects of varying tibial and femoral attachment locations, applying anterior and posterior forces, and altering the range of flexion. We found that altering the femoral attachment had a much larger effect than had altering the tibial attachment. No femoral attachments were completely isometric. Femoral attachments that produced the smallest change in tibiofemoral distance, 2 mm and less, formed a band whose greatest width ranged from 3 to 5 mm. The axis of the 2 mm region was nearly proximal-distal in orientation and located near the center of the ACL's femoral insertion. Attachments located anterior to the axis moved away from the tibial attachment with flexion, whereas attachments located posterior to the axis moved toward the tibia. The AP position of the tibial attachment affected the orientation of the 2 mm region. Moving the tibial attachment posteriorly caused the proximal part of the region to move anterior, with little change in the location of the distal part of the region. Changing the applied joint force from anterior to posterior was similar to moving the tibial attachment posteriorly, but the effect was less pronounced. Increasing the range of flexion from 90 degrees to 120 degrees caused the 2 mm region to become narrower and changed its orientation.\r"

Impact increases the intraorbital pressure, forcing the nondistensible orbital contents through the orbital floor. The fracture is commonly caused by impact from a baseball or tennis ball. However, any blunt trauma to the orbit, as from a knee or elbow, can result in a blow-out fracture. The characteristic clinical findings include double vision, a sunken globe, and numbness in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve. Sometimes, the only sign of a blow-out fracture is the abrupt inflation of periorbital tissue with air when the patient blows his nose. Standard evaluation of these fractures includes history, physical examination, and radiographs. Some patients benefit from computed tomography (CT), which can be both diagnostic and prognostic. Blow-out fractures do not often produce serious sequelae, and the current trend is toward no treatment. However, it is imperative to rule out any serious injury to the eye itself that would require emergency treatment.\r"

The question of whether a further decrease of injury figures can still be expected from better binding adjustment is investigated in a case-control study (N = 1,148) conducted among Dutch skiers. Nonrelease of both bindings directly before injury was associated with a higher risk (odds ratio = 3.3) for lower extremity (LE) injury. Binding release before LE injury was highest (31%) among those for whom adjustment was performed and then confirmed with a test device. The proportion of nonrelease is highest for knee injuries. No effect on injury risk could be found for the time of adjustment, the method of adjustment, or the person performing the adjustment. Direct measurement of binding function seems indispensable. The use of rented or borrowed skis was associated with a higher risk (odds ratio = 1.9) for LE injury. The same holds for ignorance concerning the type of ski and the age of the skis and bindings. We concluded that binding adjustment still seems to be a risk factor open to manipulation. The efficacy of intervention aimed at better adjustment should be studied experimentally.\r"

Sixty-two percent of all the injuries occurred in organized sports, 21% in physical education classes, and 17% in unsupervised sports activities.

All patients were followed prospectively for 2 to 5 years (mean, 3 years 6 months). We found the functional results to be excellent or good in 53 patients (88%). Patients with unsatisfactory results had either generalized joint hypermobility or long-standing ligament insufficiency. Anterior talar translation (ATT) and talar tilt (TT) were measured radiologically on standardized radiographs. Patients with excellent and good functional results had better mechanical stability, both ATT and TT, than those with fair and poor functional results. A good correlation was found between clinical, functional, and radiological results. In conclusion we found that reconstruction of the ankle stability by shortening and reinsertion of the lateral ankle ligaments is a safe and simple method and is a good alternative to other more complex methods of ligament reconstruction. The method should, however, be used with great care in patients with generalized joint hypermobility or in patients with long-standing ligament insufficiency.\r"

A total of 114 patent grafts were scanned and compared with concurrent angiograms. Duplex scanning correctly identified 18 high-risk grafts by low-flow criteria and an additional 21 by stenosis criteria. There was one false-negative finding (sensitivity 98 percent). The velocity ratio of the stenosis to the adjacent graft was useful in estimating the degree of stenosis. Color flow duplex imaging reduced examination time through visual feedback by highlighting the graft and areas of high velocity. These results indicate that color flow duplex scanning, combining low- and high-peak systolic criteria, is a very sensitive screening test in the early detection of failing grafts.\r"

Conventional PTFE grafts were first used 2 to 4 weeks after implantation. Early punctures of the PTFE-silicone grafts (first 10 sessions), although more difficult to perform than late punctures, were not more difficult than punctures of conventional PTFE grafts. Late punctures in PTFE-silicone grafts were easier than conventional PTFE graft punctures. Bleeding after needle removal was significantly decreased after early and late punctures of PTFE-silicone grafts compared with conventional PTFE grafts (p less than 0.001). The PTFE-silicone graft can be used immediately after implantation, sparing patients additional access procedures for short-term dialysis. This results in less morbidity, decreased bleeding complications, shorter hospital stay, and a significant reduction in expenses.\r"

In sheep, 14 superficial femoral arteries were imaged at different sites, and a portion of each vessel was resected for immediate in vitro imaging and histologic examination. In vivo images clearly showed the intima, media, and adventitia of the vessel wall as well as the lumen-intima and media-adventitia interfaces. There was a significant correlation in measured lumen area between resected artery ultrasound images and histologic sections. We conclude that intravascular ultrasound can produce high-resolution dynamic images that demonstrate vessel wall architecture and allow precise calculation of lumen area.\r"

All injections were made in the left lateral position, and the patients turned supine immediately. Hyperbaric bupivacaine produced a significantly faster and a higher dermatomal level of bilateral complete sensory blockade than the other solutions (p less than 0.005 for each). The duration of sensory blockade was significantly longer with plain bupivacaine than with either hyperbaric solution (p less than 0.0005). The intensity of sensory blockade was significantly greater with both bupivacaine solutions than with hyperbaric cinchocaine (p less than 0.05). Onset and intensity of motor blockade were similar with all agents, but motor blockade was of significantly shorter duration with hyperbaric bupivacaine than the other agents (p less than 0.0005). Hyperbaric bupivacaine appears to be the best agent for rapid and intense sensory blockade of intermediate duration. Plain bupivacaine is more appropriate if a longer duration of action but a lower height of blockade are required, and has the advantage of less cardiovascular disturbance.\r"

In a double-blinded fashion, groups of ten patients received either 0.1 mg morphine, 0.2 mg morphine, or placebo (control group) intrathecally with lidocaine 75 mg. Standard postoperative analgesics were available to all patients. Patients receiving 0.1 mg or 0.2 mg morphine reported significantly less postoperative pain as assessed by an inverse numerical visual pain scale and required significantly fewer postoperative analgesic interventions than the control group. There was no difference between the 0.1 mg ITM and 0.2 mg ITM groups with regard to severity of postoperative pain or analgesic requirements. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly higher in the group receiving 0.2 mg ITM than in the control group. Six patients (60%) in the 0.2 mg ITM group, two patients (20%) in the 0.1 mg ITM group, and one patient (10%) in the control group experienced nausea and vomiting. No clinically evident respiratory depression occurred in any of the subjects. The authors conclude that administration of 0.1 mg or 0.2 mg of morphine intrathecally is effective in reducing postoperative pain following TURP and that 0.1 mg ITM is not associated with nausea and vomiting.\r"

The drug treatments were administered in a randomized, double-blind manner. The results obtained with each drug (dose) group were compared against those of the placebo group as a control. Changes in anxiety at 60 min after drug administration were evaluated: 1) by a trained anesthesia nurse clinician using an analog scale, 2) by the patient using the same analog scale, and 3) by the patient with the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL). Changes in sedation at 60 min were also evaluated by the patient and nurse clinician using an analog scale. Amnesia was assessed by postoperative recall of picture cards shown to the patient 1 h after receiving preanesthetic medication. There were no significant differences between any drug (dose) and placebo for changes in patient-evaluated anxiety or sedation on the analog scale. With the other measures of anxiety, only triazolam (0.5 mg) reduced anxiety more than did placebo on both the patient (MAACL) and the nurse (analog) scales. With the nurse (analog) measure of sedation, only the highest doses of triazolam and diazepam were more sedating than placebo. Triazolam (0.5 mg) was the only drug dose that produced significant amnesia. The authors conclude that drug effects on anxiety, sedation, or amnesia that are statistically significant versus placebo effect are seen at only the highest doses of triazolam (0.5 mg) and diazepam (15 mg).\r"

  ".W": "To determine the onset time and duration of high doses of vecuronium, 40 ASA Physical Status 1 and 2 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 100, 200, 300, or 400 micrograms/kg of vecuronium bromide for muscle relaxation during elective general surgery. Neuromuscular blockade was continuously quantitated by recording the electromyographic response to stimulation of the ulnar nerve train-of-four. The rate of onset of neuromuscular blockade, endotracheal intubating conditions, duration of neuromuscular blockade, and hemodynamic effects of vecuronium at each dose were evaluated and compared. The time from vecuronium administration to complete abolition of twitch tension (T1 = 0%) decreased from 208 +/- 41 to 106 +/- 35 s as the vecuronium dose was increased from 100 to 400 micrograms/kg (P less than 0.01). Corresponding times to endotracheal intubation (T1 less than 20%) also decreased from 183 +/- 24 to 96 +/- 31 s with increasing doses (P less than 0.01). Recovery time (T1 = 25%) increased from 37 +/- 13 to 138 +/- 24 min with increasing doses (P less than 0.01). No significant hemodynamic differences between the four groups were observed. Endotracheal intubating conditions were good or excellent in all patients. High doses of vecuronium may, therefore, be a useful alternative to succinylcholine when a rapid onset of neuromuscular blockade is required.\r"

  ".W": "To determine in adults and children the dose-response relationship and the duration of action of pipecuronium bromide during fentanyl-nitrous oxide (N2O), isoflurane, and halothane anesthesia, the authors studied 30 ASA Physical Status 1-2 adults (age: 16-55 yr) and 30 ASA Physical Status 1-2 children (age: 1.7-11.5 yr) during minor elective surgery. Patients were anesthetized with N2O/O2 (60:40) supplemented with either fentanyl (4 micrograms/kg), or isoflurane (adults, 0.9%; children, 1.2%), or halothane (adults, 0.6%; children, 0.7%). Neuromuscular (NM) blockade was measured by electromyography. Incremental iv doses of pipecuronium were administered to determine the cumulative dose-response relationship of pipecuronium until a 95% twitch depression (ED95) had been obtained. In adults, ED50 was 31.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/kg (mean +/- SE) during fentanyl-N2O/O2, reduced by isoflurane (18.0 +/- 4.8 micrograms/kg, P less than 0.05) but not by halothane (25.0 +/- 2.6 micrograms/kg, NS). ED95 was 59.4 +/- 5.4 micrograms/kg during fentanyl-N2O/O2, reduced by isoflurane (42.3 +/- 2.5 micrograms/kg, P less than 0.05), but not by halothane (49.7 +/- 3.1 micrograms/kg, NS). In children, ED50 was 43.9 +/- 4.7 micrograms/kg during fentanyl-N2O/O2, reduced by isoflurane (23.1 +/- 1.6 micrograms/kg, P less than 0.05), and halothane (33.2 +/- 3.2 micrograms/kg, P less than 0.05). ED95 was 79.3 +/- 9.8 micrograms/kg during fentanyl-N2O/O2, and reduced by isoflurane (49.1 +/- 3.1 micrograms/kg, P less than 0.05), but not by halothane (62.5 +/- 7.3 micrograms/kg, NS). Comparison between adults and children reveals no statistically significant differences, except for ED50 during fentanyl-N2O/O2 anesthesia which was increased in children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A balloon atrial septostomy was created transvenously in anesthetized pigs (mean diameter 8.6 mm +/- 1 mm). Monitoring included transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) of the right and left heart, ECG, EEG, direct arterial pressure, right and left atrial pressures (RAP and LAP), pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). With the animal in a head up tilt, air was infused into the superior vena cava at a rate of 0.27 ml.kg-1.min-1 for 6 min or until PAE was identified on the TEE. Four situations were studied--intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), intermittent positive pressure ventilation with 10 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), spontaneous ventilation, and IPPV following infusion of 500 ml hetastarch. The incidence of PAE was not different in any of the four situations. Release of PEEP resulted in an increase in the amount of PAE or new PAE in nine of 14 animals. PAE occurred both with and without mean RAP exceeding mean LAP and the incidence of PAE was not significantly different based on the atrial pressure gradient. In situations during which the mean LAP remained greater than mean RAP throughout the venous air infusion and PAE occurred, transient reversal of the right to left atrial pressure gradient during a portion of each cardiac cycle was demonstrated.\r"

Now there are new femoropopliteal and tibiofemoral tests, described originally by Odisio in Argentina and, in a modified form applying ultrasound, introduced in Europe by Krcilek and Bartak. An experiment with 25 patients was performed to verify the conclusive evidence of the tests. The diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis was examined here by clinical and femoropopliteal and tibiofemoral tests according to Odisio. Finally the diagnosis was verified by the Doppler ultrasonic method. The principle of the femoropopliteal test is the palpative perception, when the fingertips of the left hand applied to the inguen somewhat medially from the femoral artery detect the deep venous wave caused by a repeated percussion of the right hand in the fossa poplitea. Getting some experience enables one to practice simple examinations leading to verification of a suspected diagnosis of femoral thrombosis. Replacing the palpating hand by a sonde of an ultrasonic detector gave substantial precision to examinations in the test modification. Similarly the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of the calf was verified by the percussional tibiofemoral test, when the right hand repeatedly percussed on the calf in the course of crural veins, while the left hand palpated the transmission of the wave to the inguen. Both modifications of the femoropopliteal and tibiofemoral tests were verified by the classical ultrasonic examination method. The results were compared with those from a control group of 25 patients without clinical and phlebogic symptoms of disease of the lower limbs.\r"

Duplex monitoring was performed to evaluate transplant status from hemodynamic patterns of the graft arteries. A duplex scanner with a 3.75 MHz sector transducer was used; pulsed Doppler was utilized to detect blood flow velocities in the main renal, segmental, interlobar and arcuate arteries. Arterial signals were quantified through a pulsatility index (PI). Three cases of acute rejection (AR), 9 cases of chronic rejection (CR), 2 cases of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity (Csa Tox), and 4 cases of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) were recognized and biopsy proved. At each arterial site PI values of normally functioning allografts were lower than 1.5; AR patients showed PI values ranging from 1.7 to 3.1, promptly lowered by immunosuppressive treatment. CR patients had a spectrum of PI from 0.5 to 3.1. Patients with Csa Tox and ATN showed in all the explored sites normal arterial signals and thus normal PI values. PI variations reflect even slight blood flow reductions due to immunologically mediated increases in intrarenal arterial resistances. Duplex sonography of allografted kidneys shows great diagnostic attitudes in the noninvasive characterization of transplant malfunction.\r"

After it was ascertained that the findings from continuous-wave (cw) Doppler of carotid and vertebral arteries, performed in the standard position, were normal, the examination was then done in De Kleyn's position, the velocity signal being detected at the mastoidal slopes. The abnormal findings were classified into two groups: \"loss of diastolic velocity signal\" and \"absence of velocity signal.\" In the control group, changes of flow were detected in 6.31%, whereas in the group of patients abnormal Doppler parameters were detected in 33.33%. None of the patients who were submitted to angiography showed abnormal hemodynamic findings. The authors suggest that the detection of the velocity signal of the vertebral arteries in De Kleyn's position could be of help in revealing conditions that could cause, in time, signs and/or symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency in subjects with possible asymptomatic anomalies of the circle of Willis.\r"

Extensive review of reports indicates this has resulted from observations of either (1) inordinate incidence of MVP in well-defined neurologic entities or (2) development of neurologic or ophthalmologic complications attributed to MVP. In the review presented, basis is found for categorizing MVP by its association with (1) well-defined, genetically determined neurologic disorders; (2) disorders characterized by structural abnormalities, many genetically determined, or inflammatory processes of connective tissues; (3) \"mechanical\" prolapse resulting from disproportion of mitral valve annulus and left ventricular size, which is, at times, reversible; and (4) a generally asymptomatic state that, at times, is associated with ischemic, thrombotic, embolic, and infectious disorders of the brain and eye. The paradox between the large number of persons with MVP in the general population who remain healthy and a subpopulation of patients with complications of MVP (eg, stroke) or other entities has been identified. A second paradox is found between the well-known increased incidence of MVP, especially in young patients with stroke, and the apparent rarity of stroke among patients with both common (eg, migraine) and unusual (eg, myotonic dystrophy) neurologic entities in which an extraordinary high prevalence of MVP is known to exist.\r"

In rural areas, previous studies on survival with defibrillation by EMT-Ds have been variable. We conducted an EMT-D study to determine effectiveness in various prehospital settings. Sixty-four ambulance services from communities ranging in size from rural areas to city suburbs participated in our prospective study. EMTs were trained in rhythm recognition and the use of a manual defibrillator during a standardized 20-hour course. Over 18 months, data were collected locally for central analysis. Five hundred sixty-six patients with primary cardiac arrest were included in our study: 36 (6.4%) survived. Retrospective review revealed survival before EMT-D implementation to be 3.6% (P less than .02). Three hundred four patients (54%) had an initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, with 33 (11%) surviving. The survival rate for EMT-D-witnessed arrest with an initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation was 42%. Patients with asystole were countershocked in our study; however, there were no survivors from this group. The neurologic status of survivors at time of hospital discharge was normal in 72%. The average response time, defined as time of emergency medical services activation to the time of EMT-D arrival, was 7.3 +/- 5.8 and 3.7 +/- 2.0 minutes for nonsurvivors and survivors, respectively (P less than .002). There were no survivors when the response time was more than eight minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We hoped to identify a subset of ED radiographs that did not require mandatory review by a radiologist. For each of the 1,872 plain radiographs studied, emergency physicians assigned a confidence level to the interpretation before comparing it with the radiologist's dictated report. A second radiologist was consulted to resolve disagreements. The overall rate of interpretive agreement was 94.6%. Agreement varied significantly (P less than .001) as a function of confidence level and by type of radiograph, but not by training level. Agreement varied significantly (P less than .001) as a function of confidence level for some types of radiographs (eg, chest, extremities) and for some types of radiographic findings (acute positive). No subset of radiographs had 100% agreement. Treatment was potentially altered in 38 patients as a result of the interpretive disagreement that occurred in 2% of studied radiographs. We conclude that the interpretive agreement rate increases in relation to interpretive confidence but that confidence levels cannot safely exclude certain radiographs from mandatory review by a radiologist.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To critically evaluate the accuracy, advantages, and drawbacks of duplex ultrasound as a diagnostic test for proximal deep-vein thrombosis. DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language search using MEDLINE (1980 to 1988) and bibliographies from articles, and a hand search of pertinent radiology and ultrasound journals from 1988. STUDY SELECTION: All series comparing duplex ultrasound to the reference standard, contrast venography, were reviewed and classified into levels based on the quality of study design. DATA EXTRACTION: Results of duplex ultrasound compared with venography in the proximal deep venous system, technical problems encountered, frequency of diagnosis of other causes of leg swelling, and frequency of unsuccessful or inconclusive studies were collated. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Four well-designed studies reported similar results. The sensitivity of duplex ultrasound in detecting proximal thrombi ranged from 92% to 95% with a combined sensitivity of 93% (CI, 88% to 98%), and the specificity ranged from 97% to 100% with a combined sensitivity of 98% (CI, 96% to 100%). Similar findings were noted in nine other studies that had minor methodologic flaws. Four studies reported that ultrasound was able to identify a nonthrombotic cause of leg swelling in 5% to 15% of cases. Four studies found that duplex ultrasound was inconclusive in 1% to 6% of cases, with a combined frequency of 2%. CONCLUSIONS: Duplex ultrasound appears to be very accurate in the detection of acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis. This test has major advantages as well as certain limitations compared with other diagnostic methods.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To assess the causes, methods of diagnosis, clinical spectrum, and management of mitral valve prolapse. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Results of prospective study of over 800 subjects at Cornell Medical Center from 1979 to the present were used along with studies published from 1963 to 1989 identified by computerized literature searches of Index Medicus and MEDLINE, and by hand searches. STUDY SELECTION: Studies involving controlled design, longitudinal follow-up, or critical assessment of diagnostic methodology, and clinical studies or previous reviews that have contributed most to the understanding of mitral valve prolapse were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Data concerning the causes, clinical manifestations and complications, and prevalence of mitral valve prolapse, as well as the strength of association between mitral valve prolapse and diagnostic signs, were evaluated and used to develop a practical approach to evaluating and managing patients. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Most instances of mitral valve prolapse are primary and inherited, with possible genetic heterogeneity. Mitral prolapse may be diagnosed by auscultation of midsystolic clicks and late-systolic murmurs that respond typically to maneuvers, or by billowing of mitral leaflets across the mitral anular plane in long-axis, two-dimensional echocardiographic views or by a late-systolic, posterior leaflet displacement of at least 2 mm in meticulously targeted M-mode recordings. Mitral valve prolapse is associated with thoracic bony abnormalities, low body weight, low blood pressure, and a modest excess of orthostatic hypotension, syncope, palpitations, and atrial arrhythmias, but not with nonspecific symptoms (atypical chest pain, dyspnea, anxiety or panic attacks). Complications of mitral valve prolapse, including about 4000 mitral valve operations, 1100 cases of endocarditis, and possibly 4000 sudden deaths per year in the United States, are concentrated disproportionately in older men, with about 5% of affected men and 1.5% of affected women ultimately requiring valve surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis for endocarditis and closeness of follow-up should be related to the occurrence of the independent risk factors for complications of mitral prolapse (presence of mitral regurgitation, male gender, and age over 45 years), whereas active management and close observation are needed for severe mitral regurgitation and advanced ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Using indirect immunofluorescence with antibody to human eosinophil granule major basic protein, major basic protein was observed both within tissue eosinophils and deposited extracellularly outside eosinophils in the dermis of eight patients with herpes gestationis. Possible mechanisms whereby eosinophils might be activated to degranulate in herpes gestationis are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade the results of slightly fewer than 1000 resections of liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma have been analyzed, retrospectively reanalyzed, and reviewed. The following are confirmed conclusions: major liver resection can be performed safely (less than a 5% operative mortality rate); 20% to 25% of these patients are cured; no other regional therapy options have any curative potential. The following caveats are also obvious: most patients who are operated on are not cured; although predictors have been proposed to select patients most likely to benefit from surgery, none is discriminating in and of itself; most therapy questions in this group of patients have not been addressed in any formal way; surgery for isolated regionally recurrent colon and rectum carcinoma remains an important stopgap only until effective systemic therapy is discovered. This review of our own and other single and multi-institutional prospective and retrospective data will be framed by the following questions. (1) Does resection of liver metastases cure patients or simply select those who would have survived in the long-term without any therapy? (2) In the absence of any formalized, properly designed trial, how can one judge the benefit of resection? (3) Why do metastases recur only in the liver? (4) What new therapies should focus on the predominant secondary failure sites in the majority of patients who do not benefit from hepatic metastasis resection?\r"

  ".W": "Chronic pancreatitis is associated with glucose intolerance and resultant pancreatogenic diabetes. Using the canine pancreatic duct-ligated model of pancreatitis, we serially evaluated pancreatic histology and electron microscopy, tolerance to intravenous and oral glucose, and insulin response to glucose loading. Pancreatic duct ligation caused microscopic evidence of acute pancreatitis at 1 week, progressing to acinar loss and fibrosis consistent with chronic pancreatitis at time periods up to 6 months. The islets of Langerhans showed degranulation early and appeared to be structurally preserved late. Calculated K values indicated a progressive significant deterioration in intravenous glucose tolerance, falling significantly from 3.46 +/- 0.23 basally to 1.51 +/- 0.17 at 6 months after duct ligation (p less than 0.0001). Oral glucose tolerance deteriorated significantly, with the integrated glucose response rising from 23.7 +/- 1.2 g/dl.minute basally to 32.3 +/- 2.8 g/dl.minute at 6 months after duct ligation (p less than 0.05). Integrated insulin response to both intravenous and oral glucose deteriorated with pancreatitis. Pancreatitis-induced glucose intolerance is a consistent feature of this duct-ligated model. Glucose intolerance stabilizes between 4 and 6 months after duct ligation and is associated with pancreatic acinar fibrosis and pancreatic endocrine structural preservation. While the mechanism of altered glucose tolerance may involve mechanical, neural, humoral, or vascular events, our data clearly support the conclusion that pancreatic ductal stenosis with resultant pancreatic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis is associated with abnormal islet responsiveness leading to circulating insulin deficiency and glucose intolerance, despite histologic and ultrastructural evidence of intact islets of Langerhans.\r"

The emptying half-times ranged from 2 minutes to greater than 20 minutes. Rapid emptying was associated with dumping symptoms (p less than 0.03) and shorter orocoecal transit-time (p less than 0.05). Serum glucose concentrations rose more quickly in jejunal interposition, but the areas under the curve were identical in both groups. The median insulin-to-glucose ratio (areas under the curve) during the 20 minutes after the meal was 11.4 in jejunal interposition and 7.1 in Roux-y esophagojejunostomy (NS). Interposition cases had regained a significantly higher percentage (89%) of their premorbid weight than patients with Roux-y (78%; p less than 0.05). The weight/height2 ratio was above the 50th centile in 45% of interpositions, but below the 50th centile in all patients after the Roux-y mode of reconstruction (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the emptying velocity of the gastric substitute has no impact on postoperative weight gain. The authors contend that the concept of a gastric substitute pouch is not supported by the findings of this study.\r"

Of the 58 patients with hypersplenism who were analyzed in this study, hypersplenism was more commonly associated with postnecrotic cirrhosis than other kinds of liver disease (55.3% (47/85) vs. 14.5% (11/76); p less than 0.001). Postoperative platelet counts were statistically higher than preoperative values (p less than 0.05). The latest platelet counts were more than 100,000/mm3 in 53 patients (91.4%). Of the eight patients whose preoperative and postoperative spleen volumes could be compared, all showed the reduction in the spleen size (p less than 0.02).

A tumor extending from the right lobe through the middle portion of the liver was excised. The postoperative course was satisfactory and marked regeneration of the residual hepatic tissue was observed. Also the blood level of ammonia in the superior mesenteric vein was low, approximately 120 micrograms/dl, compared to the normal value of 350 micrograms/dl in the portal vein. This low blood level may indicate the presence of some homeostatic control mechanism.\r"

A cure was usually achieved with one alcohol sclerotherapy treatment. Only minor side effects such as transient pain and temperature elevation occurred. No recurrences were found during a follow-up period of 12 to 32 months. The results indicate that aspiration and alcohol sclerotherapy is a feasible alternative to surgical intervention in patients with symptomatic nonneoplastic congenital hepatic cysts.

This study examined the temporal relationship between changes in blood leukocyte subsets and plasma mediators following endotoxin administration to normal human subjects. A five-minute intravenous infusion of purified LPS (20 units/kg Escherichia coli) was administered to 12 healthy volunteers. Blood samples were obtained at varying intervals after infusion and analyzed for differential cell counts and lymphocyte subsets (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, and HLA-DR) by flow microfluorimetry, and also assayed for plasma cachectin/TNF, epinephrine, and cortisol. Plasma cachectin/TNF was significantly elevated at 75 and 90 minutes after infusion with a peak concentration of 261 +/- 115 pg/ml noted 75 minutes after infusion. A significant plasma epinephrine elevation of 181 +/- 75 pg/ml was demonstrated one hour after infusion, while significant elevations in plasma cortisol were noted from one to five hours after infusion with a peak level of 34 +/- 3 micrograms/dl three hours after infusion. A profound monocytopenia (p less than 0.01) was noted one hour after infusion. Temporally associated with the rise in plasma cortisol was a reversal of the early granulocytopenia to a significant granulocytosis (p less than 0.01 versus preinfusion mean), whereas a marked lymphocytopenia (p less than 0.01) was observed from one to six hours after infusion. During the period of hypercortisolemia, CD2, CD3, and CD4 lymphocyte percentages were decreased (p less than 0.01) while CD20 and HLA-DR lymphocyte percentages were increased (p less than 0.01). There was a small percentage decrease in CD8 lymphocytes from one to 24 hours after infusion (p less than 0.01), although relative to the one-hour nadir, there was a significant rise in the percentage during the time of elevated plasma cortisol concentrations. A six-hour infusion of epinephrine (30 ng/kg/min) administered to six healthy volunteers resulted in a monocytosis (p less than 0.05) and granulocytosis (p less than 0.01) without a change in lymphocyte number or lymphocyte subset percentage. Previous reports have shown that in vivo corticosteroid infusion causes a prominent granulocytosis, monocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia with a decrease in the percentages of CD3 and CD4 lymphocytes. The peripheral blood leukocyte dynamics documented in the current study are similar to patterns observed following in vivo corticosteroid administration. This study suggests that the acute adrenocortical response to endotoxemia primarily mediates the subsequent changes in leukocyte subsets.\r"

Transition metals, primarily iron, greatly enhance the generation of these active species, which can destroy a large variety of biomolecules, in particular the lipid components of cell membranes. This review tries to demonstrate why cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping are situations that predispose to oxygen free radical production, and how \"anti-free radical\" agents such as enzymatic scavengers, antioxidants, and iron chelators may prove to be useful therapeutic adjuncts in the clinical setting of open heart surgery.\r"

The ability of the system to detect medically significant errors using standard (1(3s] and enhanced (mean and range) quality control procedures is investigated. Error detection is found to be adequate for most analytes when error limits are based on physicians' opinions and a mean and range quality control system is used. Error detection is unsatisfactory when error limits based on intraindividual biological variation are used and this cannot be improved by using better quality control systems. The limiting factor is analytical precision. The use of error limits based on biological variation as proposed by major clinical chemistry professional bodies cannot be achieved using most current types of analytical technology.\r"

The results of steroid receptor stainings were semiquantitatively assessed (histoscore) on the basis of nuclear staining intensity and the percentage of positively stained carcinoma cell nuclei. Carcinomas negative for either receptor had significantly higher percentages of Ki-67-positive cells. The highest percentages of Ki-67-positive cells were observed in carcinomas negative for both estrogen and progesterone receptors. There was a highly significant decrease in receptor histoscores with increasing proliferative cell fractions as determined by Ki-67 positivity. No significant (progesterone receptor) or poor negative correlation (estrogen receptor) was observed when proliferative cell fractions were related to receptor concentrations from conventional steroid-binding assays. Immunoperoxidase staining for the Ki-67 antibody-defined proliferation antigen and steroid receptors in tissue sections provides a simple means to gain information of therapeutic and prognostic importance.\r"

The cysts of the albuginea were located in the anterior, lateral, and inferior faces of the testis (distant from the epididymis) and covered by a thin albuginea. They extended toward the testicular parenchyma or toward the tunica vaginalis. Their epithelial lining varied from low cuboidal to columnar and consisted of ciliated or nonciliated cells. These cysts were probably of mesothelial origin. The cysts of the testicular parenchyma were also located distant from the mediastinum testis and were not in contact with the albuginea. Their epithelial lining consisted of flattened, cuboidal, nonciliated cells. The origin of the cysts of the testicular parenchyma is not clear. In one case the occurrence of spermatozoa in the cyst lumen and connections with seminiferous tubules suggests an origin in the rete testis.\r"

We have performed two-color flow cytometric quantitation of nuclear antigen p105 and DNA content in nuclear suspensions from 80 paraffin-embedded lymphomas. High-grade lymphomas with diploid DNA histograms tended to express high levels of p105 in all phases of the cell cycle. Aneuploid populations, observed in 14 of 80 cases, showed high p105 expression compared with diploid cells of the same case, with the highest aneuploid:diploid p105 ratios in the high-grade group. We conclude that high-grade or DNA aneuploid lymphomas tend to have increased expression of p105; but considerable variations within each histologic subtype were observed, and the differences between histologic grades were not statistically significant. Further studies that correlate p105 expression and clinical outcome will help to determine the prognostic value of this marker.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperreactio luteinalis (HL) refers to moderate to marked cystic enlargement of the ovaries due to multiple benign theca lutein cysts and is most often associated with hydatidiform mole or choriocarcinoma. The cause of this condition is unknown, but is believed to be related to elevated levels of, or abnormal ovarian response to, human chorionic and pituitary gonadotropins. Only 47 cases of HL unassociated with trophoblastic disease have been previously reported in the English-language literature, mostly before 1974, and almost exclusively in the gynecologic literature. We present two additional cases of HL unassociated with trophoblastic disease and review the literature. One of our case reports documents the unusual occurrence of unilateral HL. Of the 49 cases described, 11 occurred with fetal hydrops (8 immunologic; 3 non-immunologic), 8 with multiple pregnancies, and 30 in otherwise normal single pregnancies. Hyperreaction luteinalis is most often bilateral and found incidentally at the time of cesarean section. However, HL may present during any trimester as an abdominal mass or acute abdomen. The natural course is postpartum regression. Recognition of HL is important, since misinterpretation at laparotomy or erroneous histologic diagnoses have resulted in unnecessary surgery, often with sterilization in 16 of the cases. A conservative approach is indicated with wedge biopsy and frozen section diagnosis. Oophorectomy is necessary only to remove infarcted tissue or to control hemorrhage.\r"

When hysterectomies were performed on patients with endometrial involvement, the myometrium was usually found to contain nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas. By contrast, uterine tuberculosis usually spares the myometrium. The differential diagnosis between uterine sarcoidosis and uterine tuberculosis is discussed.\r"

We also stress the need to restore the term choristoma, now in disuse.\r"

The aim of this report was to review the incidence, severity, and outcome of abdominal complications in our heart transplant population in whom we used corticosteroid-sparing protocols for immunosuppression. From March 1985 through September 1988, 178 patients underwent 185 cardiac transplants. Twenty-six cardiac transplant recipients (15%) sustained 33 major abdominal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 8), pancreatitis (n = 8), bowel perforation (n = 6), cholecystitis (n = 4), and miscellaneous other problems (n = 7). Operative therapy was required in 61% of cases. No deaths were caused by the gastrointestinal complications of their operative management. Corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppression may be responsible for the low incidence of abdominal morbidity, and early, aggressive surgical intervention may reduce subsequent mortality.\r"

A previously described preoperative risk score was applied prospectively to estimate the relative risk of mortality following liver transplantation in adults. Categorization of the causes of death allowed for a systematic search for errors in management and technique. Comparison of the preoperative risk score with the cause of death category revealed that higher-risk adults were most likely to die of causes related to preoperative morbidity. They also accrued higher hospital costs, regardless of outcome. The data are useful for designing strategies to reduce mortality. However, the inexorable role that preoperative morbidity has on outcome was also emphasized. This has important implications in developing strategies to reduce the costs of liver transplantation and to provide optimal distribution of scarce donor organs.\r"

All patients had duplex scans of the major veins of both legs preoperatively, on the third and seventh postoperative days, and at weekly intervals thereafter if hospitalized. All patients received elastic stocking and intermittent mechanical calf compression. Perioperative DVT was diagnosed by duplex scan in 17 cases (4.7%); 2 cases were present preoperatively and the remaining 15 cases developed after surgery. Venography detected only one false-positive scan in this series. One patient with DVT died, but the postmortem examination revealed no pulmonary embolism. The results of serial venous scans were normal in 344 cases. There were no in-hospital pulmonary embolisms in any patient with normal venous scan results. Two patients (0.6%) with normal serial scan results had fatal pulmonary embolism 1 and 3 weeks after discharge. Duplex venous scanning was useful for prospective DVT surveillance of a high-risk group. The overall incidence of DVT (4.7%) is below that expected in such patients, suggesting the effectiveness of the program of prophylaxis. Scan results were reliable for therapeutic decisions and did not jeopardize patient safety.\r"

This child has a deletion of part of band 21 of the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp21) and three other X-linked disorders: congenital adrenal hypoplasia, glycerol kinase deficiency, and Duchenne type muscular dystrophy. The electroretinogram showed negative scotopic and abnormal photopic waveforms that were similar, if not identical, to the electroretinographic findings in both Aland Island eye disease and X-linked incomplete congenital stationary night blindness. Because of this similarity and the defective dark adaptometry that has been reported in patients with this disorder, we believe that Aland Island eye disease is more appropriately classified as a form of congenital night blindness than as a form of ocular albinism. From our case and review of the literature, Aland Island eye disease and incomplete congenital stationary night blindness appear indistinguishable. If further studies confirm that the disorders are the same, we recommend use of the term Aland Island eye disease or Forsius-Eriksson-Miyake syndrome. We also recommend that the gene symbols CSNB1 and CSNB2 be used for complete congenital stationary night blindness and Aland disease, respectively.\r"

All operated-on eyes were treated with topical and subconjunctival dexamethasone sodium phosphate. Ten of the 21 rabbits also received oral acyclovir (intravenous acyclovir was given at the time of surgery). Postoperatively, 9 (82%) of 11 operated-on eyes in rabbits not treated with acyclovir had positive HSV-1 ocular cultures. In acyclovir-treated rabbits, however, none of the 10 operated-on eyes had positive ocular cultures. In addition, 9 (82%) of 11 of the operated-on eyes had geographic ulcers develop in the non-acyclovir-treated rabbits, compared with 1 (10%) of 10 in the acyclovir-treated rabbits. Finally, stromal keratitis appeared in 5 (56%) of 9 of the operated-on eyes in non-acyclovir-treated rabbits and 1 (12%) of 8 of the operated-on eyes in acyclovir-treated rabbits. The results of this study indicate that acyclovir significantly lowered the incidence of HSV-1 ocular shedding, geographic ulceration, and stromal keratitis in a rabbit autograft penetrating keratoplasty model.\r"

  ".W": "A technique of feeding alcohol as part of a liquid diet is reviewed that achieves an alcohol consumption of clinical relevance, while maintaining dietary control and providing adequate nutrition. With this procedure, blood alcohol levels are obtained which mimic clinical conditions and allow experimental duplications of many pathological complications caused by alcohol. In the rat, the liquid diet technique provides a model for the alcoholic fatty liver, various alcohol-induced metabolic, endocrine and central nervous system abnormalities (including tolerance and dependence) and the interaction of ethanol with industrial solvents, many commonly used drugs, analgesics, carcinogens and nutrients. This technique also resulted in the discovery of a new pathway of ethanol metabolism in the microsomes involving an ethanol-specific cytochrome P-450 (P450IIE1), which has now been confirmed in man. P450IIE1 contributes not only to the metabolic tolerance to ethanol, but also explains the enhanced susceptibility of the alcoholic to many ubiquitous xenobiotic agents. The liquid diet technique provides the flexibility to adjust to special experimental or physiological needs by allowing for various substitutions including changes in lipids, proteins or other dietary constituents. This procedure is thereby ideally suited for the study of the interactions of alcohol with deficiency or excess of various nutrients. The technique also facilitates the comparison with controls by simplifying pair feeding procedures. Although the flexibility of the liquid diet technique is one of its key advantages, a standard 'all purpose' liquid diet is described which is appropriate for most experimental applications. In addition, two other general formulae are given, namely a low fat diet (that allows the study of the effects of ethanol in the presence of minimal hepatic lipid accumulation) and a high protein diet (to meet increased needs, e.g. during pregnancy and lactation). The optimal amount of ethanol for the rat liquid diet was found to be 5 g/dl or 36% of total energy. With lesser amounts of alcohol, intake falls below a critical threshold; blood levels of alcohol then become negligible and the model becomes irrelevant to clinical conditions. In the rat, amounts of ethanol above 5 g/dl were not found to be associated with any further gain in alcohol ingestion. By contrast, in the baboon, the ethanol content could be raised profitably to 7 g/dl or 50% of total energy and resulted in the development of cirrhosis. This higher alcohol intake, together with species difference, may explain the greater severity of liver lesions produced by alcohol in the baboon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Following a 75-g glucose dose, plasma glucose and insulin were measured for a three-hour period. In separate studies, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was estimated by measuring the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) and insulin (SSPI) concentrations achieved during the last 30 minutes of a 180-minute continuous infusion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucose (insulin suppression test). Under these conditions endogenous insulin secretion was suppressed, and differences in SSPG concentration allowed comparisons of the ability of exogenous insulin to stimulate disposal of an identical glucose load in different individuals. The results indicated that men with untreated hypertension had significantly elevated plasma glucose (P less than .001) and insulin concentrations (P less than .001) after an oral challenge compared to normal volunteers. Mean SSPG concentrations were also higher (P less than .05) than normal in patients with untreated hypertension.2+ Furthermore, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations after the oral glucose challenge and SSPG concentration during the insulin suppression test were higher in treated than in treated patients than in untreated patients with hypertension. These results confirm earlier observations that untreated patients with hypertension are insulin resistant, hyperglycemic, and hyperinsulinemic compared to a well-matched normotensive control group, and suggest that conventional treatment programs for lowering blood pressure many exaggerated these metabolic defects.\r"

  ".U": "89335280\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the relation of calcitonin as a calcium-active hormone to its more recently described effects on peripheral vascular tone. Basal renal renin secretion in vitro in rat kidney slices was studied in the presence of salmon calcitonin (SCT, 4400 U/mg), amino acid substituted analogues of SCT, 16-alanine SCT (6200 U/mg) and 12,16,19 tri-alanine SCT (350 U/mg), and of rat calcitonin gene-related peptide (rCGRP). All calcitonin species at the same hypocalcemic activity (1 U/mL) modestly but significantly suppressed renin secretion from control levels (9.79 +/- 0.44 to 7.51 +/- 0.53, 7.70 +/- 0.72, and 7.78 +/- 0.90 Goldblatt units/g/h for SCT, 16-ala SCT, and tri-ala SCT, P less than .05 for all calcitonins v control), whereas rCGRP had no effect. Thus, on a molar basis, the renin suppressing effects of the various calcitonin species paralleled their bioassay-defined calcium sequestering activity, 16-ala SCT greater than SCT much greater than tri-ala SCT. Lower concentrations of SCT (10(-2) U/mL and 10(-4) U/mL, approximately 6 X 10(-10) and 6 X 10(-12) mol/L, respectively) had virtually identical effects. Moreover, verapamil (5 X 10(-6) mol/L) blocked the SCT-induced suppression of renin secretion (9.79 +/- 0.44 v 9.36 +/- 1.05 GU/g/h, P = NS). We conclude that the juxtaglomerular apparatus is a calcitonin-responsive system, in which calcitonin and its analogues act to suppress basal renin secretion in vitro. This effect seems to depend on and may be mediated by modulating cellular calcium uptake, and suggests a wider, calcium-related role for calcitonin than had previously been suspected.\r"

In order to define the relative affinity of three antihypertensive alpha 2-agonists for the two classes of receptors, we performed competition studies of imidazoline alpha 2-antagonist 3H-RX 781094 and nonimidazoline antagonist 3H-rauwolscine binding to basolateral membranes from rabbit proximal tubule. The order of potency for inhibition of radioligand binding to basolateral membranes was rilmenidine greater than clonidine greater than guanfacine and clonidine greater than guanfacine greater than rilmenidine for 3H-RX 781094 and 3H-rauwolscine binding, respectively. These data show that not only clonidine, but also rilmenidine and guanfacine, drugs usually used as specific alpha 2-agonists, bind to both alpha 2- and imidazoline receptors. The higher affinity of these molecules for one or the other class of receptors could explain their different capacity to induce hypotension and side effects.\r"

  ".W": "Central monoaminergic neurons, particularly noradrenergic neurons, are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Dietary NaCl supplementation in NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) elevates blood pressure, increases peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity, and depresses endogenous noradrenaline stores and noradrenaline release in the anterior hypothalamus (AHA). NaCl-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-R) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats are resistant to the NaCl-induced alterations in blood pressure and central and peripheral noradrenergic activity, whereas uninephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats treated with DOCA + NaCl and Dahl-S rats receiving dietary NaCl supplementation develop NaCl-induced increments in blood pressure, but not depressed AHA noradrenaline release. The AHA is a major cardiovascular regulatory region, and depressor responses elicited by pharmacological (alpha 2-adrenoceptor) stimulation of this area are exaggerated in SHR-S fed a high NaCl diet compared to SHR-S fed a basal diet and SHR-R and WKY fed a high or basal NaCl diet. alpha 2-Adrenoceptors in the AHA are increased in number in SHR-S fed a high NaCl diet, presumably reflecting upregulation in response to reduced local noradrenaline release. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that decreased noradrenergic activity of sympathoinhibitory neurons in the AHA may mediate the exacerbation in hypertension that occurs in SHR-S during dietary NaCl supplementation.\r"

Hypertension-associated disease of small-diameter penetrating cerebral arteries may produce either lacunar infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage. The role of hypertension in the pathogenesis of atherothromboembolic cerebral infarction must be questioned in view of the evidence that antihypertensive therapy does not prevent myocardial infarction. Hypertension, in the absence of rheumatic heart disease, is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation. The incidence of stroke due to embolization of thrombus from the fibrillating left atrium of the nonrheumatic heart may have been overestimated in the past. Ideally, investigation of the patient who has had a stroke should include a brain-imaging study and a cerebral arteriogram. In practice, however, arteriography cannot always be justified. Treatment of the completed stroke is unsatisfactory but tissue plaminogen activator and calcium-channel blockers hold promise for cerebral infarction. Surgical decompression of the posterior fossa can be life-saving in cases of cerebellar infarction or hemorrhage. In patients with cerebral infarction, aspirin has been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke recurrence.\r"

Halves of the same rat tail artery were incubated for two hours in boiled plasma supernates from a hypertensive patient and a paired age-, sex-, and race-matched normotensive subject and then ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake was measured. Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake by their leukocytes was also measured. Eighteen pairs of subjects were studied. The uptakes were not significantly different in the hypertensive patients and control subjects. However, when we selected from the eighteen hypertensive patients, nine with low plasma renin activity on the day of the study, uptakes were reduced in the hypertensive patients relative to the paired control subjects. We also assayed plasma supernates from normotensive black and white male subjects before and after acute volume expansion (2.5 L saline IV + 1.5 L distilled water orally over a three-hour period) and from paired normotensive subjects before and after sham volume expansion and obtained a positive bioassay in the expanded subjects both on intraindividual and interindividual comparisons. These studies demonstrate increased vascular Na+-K+ pump inhibitory activity in the plasma of black male patients with low renin essential hypertension and in the plasma of normotensive subjects after acute volume expansion. The findings suggest that the inhibitory activity in the hypertensive subjects' plasma is related to volume expansion, relative or absolute.\r"

  ".U": "89335304\r", 
  ".W": "In this paper I have presented two closely related themes both of which seem to be fundamental in understanding the pathophysiology of hypertension. The first theme is the dominant role of the volume-excretion function of the kidneys in setting the long-term arterial pressure level. That is, each person in general has a rather steady intake of salt, water, and those other constituents that make up extracellular fluid. When the arterial pressure is normal, the kidney excretion of these constituents is exactly the correct amount to balance the intake of each of them. When the pressure is too great, there is more loss than gain, and the body fluid volume decreases; therefore, the pressure falls until the exact balance point is reached again; it is only at this balance point that the loss and gain are equal. At any pressure below the balance point, volume gain is greater than loss, and the pressure will continue to rise until the exact balance level is again reached. This capability of the kidney mechanism to return the pressure all-the-way back to the level of balance between input and output--not merely part-way back--is called the \"infinite gain\" characteristic of this pressure control system, and the level to which the pressure is controlled is called the \"set-point\" of the system. In pathophysiological states, the set-point for pressure control can be increased to hypertensive levels as a result of (1) a pathophysiological change in renal function or (2) increased salt and volume intake; then hypertension will ensue. Other abnormalities of circulatory function that do not affect one of these two factors cannot cause chronic hypertension because of the infinite gain feature of the renal-volume mechanism for pressure control. One such condition that does not cause hypertension without some concurrent abnormality that affects renal function is a primary increase in total peripheral resistance. The second theme is that whole-body autoregulation causes the blood flow in all parts of the body to return or remain near to normal when high arterial pressure tries to increase the flow. It does this by increasing the resistance in all parts of the peripheral arterial tree. Therefore, in effect, autoregulation converts any tendency to high cardiac output hypertension into high resistance hypertension. Yet, in so far as is now known, the pressure level will be the same with or without autoregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been widely assumed that the preventive effect of antihypertensive treatment on cardiovascular events is increased as lower blood pressure (BP) is achieved. This assumption seemed logical in light of the well-known relationship between BP level and future cardiovascular events. Hypertension, however, develops over many years and is associated with both hypertrophic and atherosclerotic changes within the coronary and peripheral vessels. Antihypertensive drugs when instituted will bring down BP and often arterial blood flow within weeks. Coronary blood flow is limited to diastole. Theoretically then, very low diastolic BPs in coronary arteries with hypertrophic and/or atherosclerotic changes might precipitate a chain of events leading to a myocardial infarction and/or a lethal arrhythmia. Recently, results from several trials have been presented indicating a J-shaped relationship between achieved BP level and incidence of coronary heart disease. These trials are reviewed and problems in the interpretation of the findings such as biaz from varying risk at entry, varying follow-up time, and choice of statistical method, are discussed. Although, the burden of evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that low attained BPs are associated with an increased risk of a coronary heart disease event, problems in the interpretation of this evidence call for further analyses of the relationship within the large hypertension trials. Until such results are at hand caution should be to avoid decreasing BP below 85 mm Hg diastolic.\r"

The evolved infarct size at 48 h was assessed by a QRS scoring system. Two groups of patients, both admitted with anterior myocardial infarction within 6 h of onset, were studied. Group 1 (n = 35) received analgesia only and group 2 (n = 33) received thrombolytic treatment either by the intracoronary (streptokinase, n = 13) or intravenous route (anistreplase, n = 20). Reperfusion was assessed angiographically. The mean (SD) potential infarct size assessed by the initial ischaemic index was similar in both groups (group 1, sigma ST area = 115 (60) mm2 and group 2 = 126 (77 mm2).

  ".W": "C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity has been found to colocalize with C3 immunoreactivity at the dermal-epidermal junction zone (DEZ) in skin specimens from patients with bullous pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus and dermatitis herpetiformis. The present study was designed to elucidate whether the C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity represents deposition of membrane attack complexes or non-lytic SC5b-9 complexes. Skin specimens from 11 patients with pemphigoid, five patients with discoid lupus erythematosus and from nine patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were studied with immunofluorescence using both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against C9 neoantigen and against vitronectin (S-protein), an inhibitor to the membrane attack complex of complement. Specimens from the pemphigoid patients demonstrated C9 neoantigen reactivity along the DEZ without detectable colocalized vitronectin. This suggests deposition of membrane attack complexes in the pemphigoid lesions. Immunoreactivity of both C9 neoantigen and vitronectin was detected in the DEZ in specimens of discoid lupus erythematosus and in the tips of dermal papillae in specimens of dermatitis herpetiformis. The combined presence of C9 neoantigen- and vitronectin immunoreactivity may indicate deposition of C9 as part of the non-lytic SC5b-9 complex. The finding reported here of differential deposition of vitronectin and C9 in different diseases indicates that the presence of C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity in tissue per se does not represent the deposition of membrane attack complexes, but that it may also be C9 deposited as part of the nonlytic SC5b-9 complex.\r"

Placentae from seven patients with pemphigoid gestationis (PG) and two patients with linear IgA disease were studied. In PG immune complexes containing IgGI and C3 were identified in six cases. In linear IgA disease IgAI containing immune complexes were found in both cases. Placentae from patients with PG showed aberrant expression of MHC Class II products. This was not seen in the placentae from patients with linear IgA disease. In PG there was incoordinate expression of the subregion products, DP and DR being more extensively and consistently expressed than DQ. These results and previous immunogenetic studies suggest that PG may be unique among organ specific autoimmune disease, the autoantibodies forming during an allogenic response rather than target cells behaving as antigen presenting cells.\r"

At the conclusion of phototherapy, and 4 weeks later, patients in the fish oil group had a greater decrease in the total body surface area of psoriasis and more improvement compared to patients in the olive oil group. The improvement in the fish oil group was statistically significantly greater for all parameters compared to the change in the olive oil group. The apparent safety and general health-promoting features of fish oil could provide an ideal adjunctive therapy for psoriasis.\r"

Each group consisted of 17 patients. The dose of retinoid was 40 mg/day during the 2-week monotherapy phase and subsequently 20 mg/day during the combination treatment. Bath PUVA was given three times a week starting with a UVA dose of 0.06 J/cm2. Remission (greater than 90% improvement) was achieved in all patients in 6-10 weeks. There were no significant differences in clinical response between the two groups; the mean +/- SD PASI score (psoriasis area and severity index) before treatment was 22.6 +/- 7.1 in the acitretin-PUVA group and 19.4 +/- 7.8 in the etretinate-PUVA group. The corresponding figures after treatment were 0.6 +/- 0.6 and 1.0 +/- 0.5, respectively. Side-effects related to retinoid treatment were frequent in both groups but they were usually mild and well-tolerated. There was only one case of diffuse alopecia after 8 weeks in the etretinate-PUVA group. Scaling of the palms and soles was seen in six patients in the acitretin-group but only in two patients in the etretinate-group. Triglycerides were elevated in about half of the patients in both groups. The present study shows that acitretin is as effective as etretinate in the combination with bath PUVA.\r"

Multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma occurs mainly in middle-aged women and is usually located at acral sites, particularly the distal extremities. Grouped, brown-red, slightly elevated, asymptomatic papules slowly develop over several months until further growth ceases. There is no evidence of systemic disease. Histologically, the dermis shows numerous well developed capillaries with prominent endothelia, large bizarre basophilic and often multinucleate cells with a sparse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. The immunohistological and ultrastructural findings suggest a fibroblastic differentiation of the large multinucleate cells.\r"

Nine controlled trials of evening primrose oil were performed in eight centres. Four of the trials were parallel and five cross-over. Doctors and patients assessed the severity of eczema by scoring measures of inflammation, dryness, scaliness, pruritus and overall skin involvement. Individual symptom scores were combined to give a single global score at each assessment point. In the analysis of the parallel studies, both patient and doctor scores showed a highly significant improvement over baseline (P less than 0.0001) due to Epogam: for both scores the effect of Epogam was significantly better than placebo. Similar results were obtained on analysis of the cross-over trials, but in this case the difference between Epogam and placebo in the doctors' global score, although in favour of Epogam, failed to reach significance. The effects on itch were particularly striking. There was no placebo response to this symptom, whereas there was a substantial and highly significant response to Epogam (P less than 0.0001). When the improvements, or otherwise, in clinical condition were related to changes in plasma levels of dihomogammalinolenic and arachidoni acids, it was found that there was a positive correlation between an improvement in clinical score and a rise in the fatty acid levels.\r"

The stage of the menstrual cycle did not affect the pulsatility index nor was there any significant difference between subjects who were nulliparous and those who had had previous pregnancies. These results show that Doppler ultrasound can be applied to the non-pregnant uterus and the data presented may be used as a baseline for the study of uterine pathology.\r"
