  ".W": "Metabolism of organic nitrates results in the formation of inorganic nitrites that can oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin. Clinical trials have investigated the risk of developing methemoglobinemia during the therapeutic use of organic nitrates. Based on the results of these trials, organic nitrate use does appear to increase methemoglobin content but not to a clinically significant extent. These elevations may be related to dose but study design prevents determination of any dose-response relationship. Despite these results, several case reports of patients experiencing clinically significant methemoglobinemia can be found in the literature. These patients generally received organic nitrates at doses greater than those used in the clinical trials, and several were diagnosed early during coronary surgery. Renal dysfunction and concurrent use of methemoglobin inducers may be contributing factors. Patients receiving organic nitrates should be monitored for symptoms suggestive of methemoglobinemia, especially while receiving large doses. Treatment of nitrate-induced methemoglobinemia consists of discontinuing the medication and, when necessary, administering methylene blue.\r"

To determine how it was being prescribed and used, we examined triazolam use in patients who had received the drug for greater than six weeks. We reviewed medical charts of 72 adult male patients from an ambulatory Veterans Administration population who had received a 30-day triazolam prescription with at least one refill. Results showed that although prescribed daily doses of triazolam were generally appropriate for the age of the patient being treated, the average length of therapy was 6.2 months. Seventy-five percent of the prescriptions had been written for a one-month supply with five refills. Neither prescriber specialty nor level of training was significantly related to length of therapy. Thirty-nine of the patients (54 percent) were available for a telephone interview to determine how the drug was actually being used and the adverse effects profile. Over 60 percent claimed to be taking the drug every night, 95 percent at the dose prescribed. Sixty-seven percent of the patients taking triazolam nightly reportedly did not sleep as well if they tried a night without the drug. Apart from effects on sleep, dizziness and confusion were the most commonly reported adverse effects. As a result of this study, automatic stop orders on discharge were implemented to limit triazolam therapy to inpatient stays. Physicians must evaluate the need for continued hypnotic therapy so that a longer-acting agent like flurazepam may be used if chronic medication is necessary.\r"

Bone marrow transplant patients at The Hospital for Sick Children are prescribed intravenous cyclosporine as part of the posttransplant immunosuppression protocol. Sampling for blood concentration measurement is generally done via a single-lumen central venous line (CVL). Cyclosporine concentrations sampled by this route were compared with concentrations in peripheral capillary samples taken concurrently. Results from the CVL blood were substantially higher despite appropriate flushing of the CVL between the end of the infusion and the time of sample collection. This discrepancy disappeared once the patient was converted to oral cyclosporine. We conclude that the sampling error is due to drug adsorbed to the silicone CVL catheters during intravenous administration and displaced during blood sample collection.\r"

  ".U": "89268892\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous factors present in the critically ill patient decrease drug clearance. The contribution of one factor, mechanical ventilation, to this decrease is largely unknown and unquantified. This article attempts to review the physiologic effects of mechanical ventilation and to propose theoretical changes in the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered drugs. Mechanical ventilation with or without positive end-expiratory pressure is a well-documented cause of decreases in cardiac output, hepatic and renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urine flow. The mean airway pressure delivered, the pathophysiologic state of the patient, and coexisting therapeutic interventions affect the degree of hemodynamic alteration. Theoretically, these hemodynamic changes can decrease the clearance of several drugs frequently administered to critically ill patients. Decreased hepatic blood flow decreases the clearance of nonrestrictively cleared drugs. The pharmacokinetics of drugs predominantly renally cleared, by either glomerular filtration or tubular secretion, are affected by a decrease in renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. Also, the clearance of agents for which tubular reabsorption is important may decrease because the reduction in urine flow resulting from mechanical ventilation allows increased time for drug reabsorption. Interventions that minimize the decrease in cardiac output and organ blood flow and, theoretically, the risk of the adverse drug reactions from decreased drug clearance include expansion of intravascular volume, administering positive inotropic agents, and decreasing mean airway pressure. Monitoring serum concentration of critical and toxic agents suspected to have altered clearance in patients receiving mechanical ventilation is recommended. We hope that our article will stimulate future research in this area to give clinicians guidelines for drug dosing in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.\r"

  ".U": "89268901\r", 
  ".W": "Milrinone is a bipyridine derivative with positive inotropic and vasodilating properties. The intravenous form of the drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for short-term management of congestive heart failure (CHF). The FDA has requested additional mortality data prior to approval of the oral form. Milrinone produces positive inotropic and vasodilating effects through unknown mechanisms, and causes a dose-dependent increase in cardiac index and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. It is extensively absorbed following oral administration with an elimination half-life of approximately 1.5-2 hours and a corresponding duration of action of 3-6 hours. Its major route of elimination is renal (83 percent). The intravenous dose is 50 micrograms/kg given over ten minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.375-0.75 micrograms/kg/min titrated to the desired hemodynamic response. The average effective oral dosage is 7.5-10 mg four to six times daily. Milrinone is most effective in the short-term management of CHF where the majority (60-80 percent) of patients have symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement as well as increases in exercise duration. However, many patients do not derive long-term benefit from milrinone therapy. Available evidence suggests that milrinone does not arrest the natural progression of CHF, and some investigators feel it may actually worsen CHF and shorten patients' length of survival. Milrinone has been generally well tolerated with a low risk of major organ toxicity. The most common adverse reactions with intravenous milrinone include ventricular arrhythmias (12 percent) and supraventricular arrhythmias (4 percent).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fibrous connective tissue sheaths (0.04 to 0.20 mm thick) formed around the distal porous-surfaced stimulating electrodes because of proliferation of endocardial connective tissue and adherence and organization of thrombus. Connective tissue sheaths were composed of fibroblasts within an abundant collagen matrix and contained scattered macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mast cells. Connective tissue sheaths around dexamethasone-eluting leads were thinner (p less than 0.03), less cellular (p less than 0.10), and had fewer mast cells (p less than 0.10) than corresponding nonsteroid leads. There was mild multifocal interstitial fibrosis, myofiber atrophy, and myofibrillar lysis in the adjacent myocardium. Thresholds for electrical stimulation of the myocardium were consistently lower for pacing leads with dexamethasone-eluting stimulating electrodes than for leads without dexamethasone.\r"

Seventy-eight percent of 91 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 73% of 41 patients with myocarditis exhibited significantly elevated anti-laminin antibody levels compared with 68 apparently healthy persons. A positive correlation was found between hemodynamic data and irregular myocardial immunofluorescence laminin staining patterns in dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. With regard to recent studies, these data suggest that antibodies to laminin in dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis enhance clusters of cell-surface laminin, inducing an alteration of the cytoskeleton, which may account for functional abnormalities in dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. Considering the fact that optical microscopy is unable to resolve sarcolemmal structures proper from the basement membranes, the high prevalence of laminin autoantibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis raises doubts as to the diagnostic value of direct immunofluorescence findings.\r"

Both tests may be used to assess prognosis after myocardial infarction, and dipyridamole imaging may be useful in patients undergoing preoperative evaluation. The use of the cold pressor test and isometric handgrip exercise have also been described. However, the value of both tests is limited by a relatively low sensitivity for detecting the presence of CAD. Other testing modalities--arm ergometry, intravenous infusion of beta-adrenergic agonists, and transthoracic pacing--show promise but require further assessment to confirm their value.\r"

On the basis of the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, the sample was classified in 2 ways: classic electrocardiographic site pattern (anterior, inferior, lateral and multiple location), and number of standard electrocardiographic leads with ischemic ST elevation (small, modest, large and extensive infarct in 2 to 9 leads). In-hospital mortality was evaluated according to infarct site, infarct extent and fibrinolytic treatment. The mortality rate was differently distributed in the various infarct sites. Streptokinase significantly reduced mortality only in anterior (13.8 vs 18.7%) and multiple site infarcts (8.1 vs 12.5%). According to the infarct extent observed, there is a progressive increase in the mortality rate--from 6.5% in small infarcts to 9.6% in modest, 14.3% in large and 21.7% in extensive. No significant benefit was obtained by streptokinase in small infarcts; in contrast, a significant decrease in mortality was achieved in modest (7.7 vs 11.4%), large (12.8 vs 16.6%) and extensive infarcts (19.5 vs 23.9%). Thus, the extent of myocardial injury seems to be more relevant than the site in determining in-hospital mortality and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Before therapy, all 4 groups did not differ in age, weight, degree of obesity, BP at work site and casual BP measured in the outpatient clinic. After 6 months of effective therapy (casual BP within the normotensive range), casual diastolic BP was identical among the 4 groups, whereas systolic BP was lower in patients treated with clonidine or oxprenolol than in those who received enalapril. A disparate pattern of antihypertensive efficacy among the 4 groups emerged when stress BP was compared, with average ambulatory BP higher in patients receiving clonidine or enalapril than in those who had oxprenolol or nitrendipine. During ambulatory BP monitoring, patients treated with oxprenolol had the lowest level at each level of physical activity and self-reported emotional arousal. During bicycle exercise, patients receiving clonidine had the highest increase in systolic BP and those administered oxprenolol the lowest, whereas the BP response during mental stress was similar among all 4 therapeutic groups. The analysis of the hemodynamic response pattern during mental stress unmasked further disparities. Oxprenolol provoked an abnormal hemodynamic response during mental stress tests (increase in total peripheral resistance), whereas nitrendipine and enalapril preserved the physiological hemodynamic profile (decrease of total peripheral resistance).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Penbutolol was administered once daily in 10, 20 or 40 mg doses for 6 weeks and compared with placebo. Mean declines from baseline in supine diastolic BP were comparable in the 3 penbutolol treatment groups and significantly superior to placebo (p less than 0.05). A significant difference between penbutolol dosage groups was observed only for supine systolic BP; the mean decline at 20 mg/day was significantly larger than that at 10 mg/day (p less than 0.05). Maximum BP response developed in approximately 4 weeks at 10 mg/day and in 2 weeks at the higher dosages. Decline in mean heart rate after 6 weeks of penbutolol therapy significantly exceeded placebo only at 40 mg/day (7.2 vs 2.5 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Treatment was well-tolerated and discontinued because of adverse effects in only 7 patients receiving penbutolol and 3 receiving placebo. The lack of significant bradycardia and the low incidence of other troublesome adverse effects are potential advantages during antihypertensive therapy with penbutolol. With rapid onset of effect and good efficacy and tolerability, the 20 mg once-daily dose appears to be optimum for therapy with this new agent.\r"

A single-blind design was used to compare a standard dose of flosequinan (100 mg) with placebo. Flosequinan produced a statistically significant increase in cardiac output, primarily through its augmentation of stroke volume. This response was accompanied by significant reductions in systemic vascular resistances and right and left ventricular filling pressures. A reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and total pulmonary vascular resistance also was observed. The vasodilatory actions of flosequinan improved overall left ventricular performance; the inotropic indexes measured were not altered. There were no significant changes in upper limb, renal or hepatic-splanchnic blood flow or in the vascular resistances of these regions after flosequinan administration. The upper limb venous capacitance increased significantly. First-dose flosequinan evokes favorable central hemodynamic changes and improves overall left ventricular performance in patients with congestive heart failure. The acute augmentation in cardiac output, however, is not accompanied by a preferential alteration of flow to any of the major vascular regions studied.\r"

The presence of endothelin binding sites was demonstrated in these vessels using an autoradiographic technique. Endothelin produced a dose-dependent increase of tension in the isolated coronary vessels with a maximal tension achieved equal to 135% of that induced by 90 mM of potassium. The maximal response was slow to develop and had a prolonged duration of 15 to 20 minutes. Nicardipine (4 microM) failed to affect the contraction induced by low doses of endothelin, but decreased the tension obtained at high doses. However, adenosine, substance P and glyceryl trinitrate were all effective in reversing the contraction induced by endothelin, while indomethacin and acetylcholine were ineffective. These features differ from those of other endogenous constrictor agents and make endothelin a potential candidate for long-term modulation of vascular tone.\r"

  ".W": "Dilevalol is a vasodilator with selective partial beta 2 agonism and nonselective beta-antagonist activity. In contrast to its potent beta 2-agonist activity, dilevalol is essentially devoid of beta 1-agonist action, and is therefore distinct from pindolol and celiprolol. Dilevalol inhibits beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors nonselectively in dogs, rats and in isolated tissues, including human myocardium, and its beta-antagonist potency is similar to that of propranolol. In contrast to its beta-antagonist activity, it exerts minimal if any alpha-adrenergic blockade. Dilevalol is 300- to 1,000-fold more potent at beta- than at alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, including those on human myocardium and mammary arteries. At antihypertensive and vasodilator doses in rats and dogs, dilevalol does not inhibit alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Oral doses of 2.5 to 50 mg/kg of dilevalol reduce blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Heart rate is not significantly affected. Tolerance does not develop to the antihypertensive response. In contrast, beta blockers such as propranolol do not reduce blood pressure in this model. Antihypertensive activity is also observed in dogs with renal hypertension. The hemodynamic profile of dilevalol is consistent with its vasodilator properties. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, antihypertensive doses of dilevalol reduce peripheral resistance without affecting cardiac output. Dilevalol also improves the compliance and distensibility of the large arteries. The vasodilator and antihypertensive responses to dilevalol are mediated by a partial agonist action at vascular beta 2 receptors, because they are inhibited by the nonselective beta blocker propranolol as well as the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551.\r"

  ".W": "Recordings of pressure in the brachial or peripheral arteries fail to disclose the marked increase in systolic pressure that occurs in the proximal aorta and central arteries with increasing age and with hypertension. This systolic pressure boost is caused by wave reflection returning from the periphery of the body while the ventricle is still contracting. Such early wave reflection is caused in turn by increased pulse-wave velocity, attributable to stiffening of the aorta and major conduit arteries. Drugs have little effect on arterial stiffening, whereas wave reflection can be markedly reduced by agents that dilate peripheral arteries. Such reduction in wave reflection causes substantial decrease of systolic pressure in central arteries. Because of differential timing of wave reflection, however, such reduction is not apparent from pressure recordings taken in the brachial or other peripheral arteries. The sphygmomanometer, therefore, fails to show the favorable effects of reduced wave reflection in the proximal aorta and central arteries. Noninvasive tonometric pressure wave recordings can supplement the sphygmomanometer to assess the magnitude of beneficial effect.\r"

Two multicenter, double-blind studies were performed: study 1 compared dilevalol administered once-daily with either dilevalol or propranolol every 12 hours; study 2 compared dilevalol administered once daily with placebo. Both studies had a placebo run-in period to establish that the baseline supine diastolic blood pressures were consistent in the mild to moderate severity range (95 to 115 mm Hg) at 2 consecutive visits for study 1 and in the mild severity range (95 to 105 mm Hg) in study 2. Patients then were randomized to the double-blind titration phase, during which doses were titrated over a 9-week period to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease from baseline of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. Patients were then maintained on a fixed dose for 2 months (study 1) or for 1 month (study 2). Dilevalol given once daily was as effective in reducing supine diastolic blood pressure as dilevalol every 12 hours and propranolol every 12 hours (study 1) and was superior to placebo (p less than 0.001) (study 2). In both studies, dilevalol given once daily was effective and well tolerated. The side-effect profile of dilevalol was similar to that of placebo and different from that of propranolol. Treatment with dilevalol resulted in significantly less fatigue (p less than 0.05), bradycardia (less than 50 beats/minute) and mental depression than with propranolol, but significantly (p less than 0.05) more diarrhea/loose stools.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three weeks of placebo washout were followed by 4 weeks of comparative treatment. Beginning with the first week of treatment, both drugs substantially decreased blood pressure from baselines of approximately 160/100 mm Hg. Decreases in systolic pressure were comparable throughout treatment, but dilevalol tended to have a greater effect on diastolic pressure. At the end of double-blind treatment, average decreases in blood pressure with dilevalol and enalapril were 16/13 and 16/11 mm Hg supine and 15/13 and 15/10 mm Hg standing (p = 0.03 for between-group comparisons of standing diastolic pressure). More dilevalol- than enalapril-treated patients achieved a diastolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg; 73 vs 55% (p = 0.02) supine, and 69 vs 43% (p less than 0.01) standing. The safety profiles of the 2 drugs were comparable. The incidence of adverse effects was low, and few patients discontinued treatment. Headache and gastrointestinal discomfort were reported in both groups. Average postural changes in blood pressure were similar to baseline. Electrocardiographic changes were rare and not treatment related. Changes in laboratory test results were minor. Heart rate decreased modestly with dilevalol relative to enalapril (6 vs 2 to 3 beats/min; p less than 0.01), but no bradycardia was observed.\r"

Among these, both hypertension and various lipid abnormalities have been shown to play an important role. A clear inverse relation between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and CHD has been observed in numerous observational and short studies. Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension has been shown to reduce dramatically some of the sequelae of high blood pressure--renal failure, cerebrovascular accidents and congestive heart failure. However, a consistent reduction in associated CHD has not been demonstrated, and the dissociation between reducing blood pressure and reduction in CHD has not been definitively explained. One of the suggested explanations relates to alterations in blood lipid levels that may be induced by certain antihypertensive agents. Changes in HDL cholesterol levels or other lipid alterations due to antihypertensive therapy could modify the beneficial effects achieved by the direct reduction of blood pressure. If so, antihypertensive agents could be subclassified as atherogenic or antiatherogenic depending on the associated changes in lipid levels. Therefore, the antihypertensive agents of choice for patients whose cholesterol levels are a concern would be those that reduce the CHD risk factor of hypertension without compromising the risk factor associated with a patient's lipid profile.\r"

As part of a multicenter prospective postinfarction trial, 123 patients with pulmonary congestion during AMI, who survived and were discharged from the coronary care unit, were studied. These patients were compared with similar patients who did not develop pulmonary congestion. Patients with pulmonary congestion had a significantly higher 1-year mortality rate compared with 744 patients without pulmonary congestion during AMI (28 vs 5.5%). Patients with pulmonary congestion were characterized by a lower ejection fraction, more frequent anterior infarction, diminished ability to perform exercise testing and higher incidence of subsequent cardiac events. Even without these variables, pulmonary congestion was associated with increased mortality. In patients with pulmonary congestion, ejection fraction (dichotomized at 30%) and exercise testing were the most discriminating tests in risk stratification. An ejection fraction greater than 30% and completion of the exercise test was associated with a 7% mortality while an ejection fraction less than 30% and inability to take or complete the exercise test was associated with a 44% 1-year mortality. A greater incidence of reinfarction, ischemia during exercise and ischemic events at the time of death in the pulmonary congestion group suggests that ischemia may be an important factor in this high risk category.\r"

The AR was continuous throughout the cardiac cycle in 3 patients, continuous when present (but not occurring with every beat) in 2 patients and present throughout diastole and continued into midsystole in the remaining patient. AR was associated with abnormalities of aortic valve opening (either its complete or intermittent absence) and with poor forward flow and even reversed flow through the native heart. It is postulated that AR in this group mainly occurs as a result of abnormal locking of the aortic valve due to severely impaired left ventricular ejection. Abnormal left ventricular diastolic function and enlargement may also be contributory.\r"

The half-times for gastric emptying were 77.5 +/- 4.6 and 39.8 +/- 3.4 min after ingestion of xylitol and glucose solutions, respectively. Glucose suppressed motilin and stimulated GIP secretion; xylitol stimulated motilin secretion but had no effect on GIP, which is currently the main candidate for the role of enterogastrone. The accelerated intestinal transit and increase in plasma motilin observed after xylitol ingestion were thought to be causally related to the diarrhea and gastrointestinal discomfort produced by it.\r"

Therefore, in the present report the authors investigated for the presence of ER and PR in lymphoid cells of endometrial stroma that may serve as potential targets for estrogen- and progesterone-mediated effects in endometrium. The presence of ER was shown in nine proliferative and ten secretory endometria and the presence of PR in three secretory and one proliferative endometria. ER and PR were localized by monoclonal antibodies, to the nuclei of cells, with the use of, respectively, peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) methods. Lymphoid cells were then delineated by decoration of their plasma membranes with the use of monoclonal antibodies to HLA-DR, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), Leu-4 (CD3), and IL-2 receptor molecules with the use of an ABC staining procedure. A group of cells in the lymphoid aggregates in endometrial stroma showing membranous staining for HLA-DR, LCA, and Leu-4 molecules had nuclear ER. IL-2 receptor-positive cells were rare in endometrium, and no PR-positive cells were found in lymphoid aggregates. Furthermore, HLA-DR and ER were expressed in the glandular and surface epithelium in the proliferative phase and in occasional glands in the basalis in the late secretory phase. The presence of an ER-positive lymphoid cell population in endometrial lymphoid aggregates suggests that these cells may serve as target cells for estrogen.\r"

CMV was recovered by conventional tissue culture from 27 specimens (54%) after an average of 17 days (range, 6-26 days).

CMV was detected in significantly more specimens by EA-4 than by tissue culture (P = 0.037). However, there was no significant difference in the detection of CMV between EA-1 and EA-4 or between EA-1 and conventional culture. The authors' data suggest that for maximum recovery of CMV from clinical specimens, both an early antigen assay and conventional tissue culture should be performed. For urine specimens it appears that inoculation of two coverslips followed by staining after overnight incubation is adequate. To optimize the yield of the early antigen assay when testing specimens other than urine, the authors recommend inoculating three coverslips, two of which should be stained after overnight incubation, and, if necessary, the third coverslip could be stained after a more prolonged incubation period.\r"

None had rejection, biliary obstruction, or other allograft dysfunction during a long follow-up. Eventually and without intervention, the alkaline phosphatase levels returned to normal. These instructive cases suggest that caution be used in advocating invasive procedures if elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are an isolated abnormality, and close observation with noninvasive testing is recommended.\r"

However, no such difference was found between duodenal ulcer patients and controls showing histologically normal gastric mucosa. On the other hand, controls with chronic superficial gastritis had PGE2 levels significantly higher than those of histologically normal subjects and duodenal ulcer patients. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an absolute gastric PGE2 deficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer disease. However, the possibility that PGE2 synthesis could be deficient in relation to the prevailing level of mucosal inflammation cannot be excluded.\r"

A year after the first admission, computed tomographic scan and selective angiography demonstrated the tumor, and surgery was performed. A solitary 2-cm tumor was noted at the surface of mesenterium of the duodenum. Frozen and paraffin section of the tumor revealed islet cell tumor apparently within a lymph node. Immunohistological examination revealed positive staining for gastrin alone. No other tumors were detectable by inspection and palpation during the operation. After excision of the tumor, serum gastrin and secretion test were normalized, and the patient remains asymptomatic 1 yr after surgery.\r"

  ".U": "89270451\r", 
  ".W": "Injury of the glomerular microvasculature by nonimmunologic processes is often the underlying mechanism of progressive deterioration of renal function in patients with a variety of renal disorders. The structural hallmark of this injury is focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, often accompanied by entrapment of hyalin. Although such lesions are quite characteristic for diseases that primarily affect the glomerular podocyte, similar damage occurs in association with functional and structural adaptive changes that develop as a consequence of a significant loss of functioning nephrons or other systemic disorders. Experimental studies have revealed that such functional adaptations include intrarenal vasodilatation that through increases in glomerular capillary pressure and plasma flow leads to a significant compensatory hyperfiltration. This functional state is accompanied by a parallel increase in glomerular volume, attained chiefly by expansion of matrix components and an increase in the number of endothelial and mesangial cells, but not of podocytes. The persistence of the adaptive changes results in endothelial, mesangial, and epithelial cell dysfunction revealed clinically by proteinuria and structurally by the development of microthrombosis, microaneurysms, mesangial expansion, and occlusion of capillaries by hyalin accumulation. Although all these pathologic processes can lead to segmental collapse of the capillary tuft, it is the progressive hyalin deposition in capillaries with defective or detached podocytes that represents the major mechanism in the development of segmental and eventually global glomerulosclerosis. The inability of the highly differentiated podocyte to replicate in response to systemic or locally released trophic factors ultimately results in imperfections of the capillary wall that set the stage for permeability defects amplified and accentuated by greatly augmented hydrodynamic forces. These structural and functional microvascular changes acting in concert not only facilitate the transcapillary convection of macromolecules that results in albuminuria, but can also be anticipated to play a key role in the entrapment and accumulation of larger macromolecules in front of the lamina densa in the form of hyalin material. Continuing damage to the glomerular microvasculature exacerbates the adaptive changes in surviving nephrons, closing a positive-feedback loop that culminates in end-stage renal failure.\r"

For comparison, we also determined how patients were assigned to the treatment modalities, based on registry data in the regions. Preferences were determined in for six standard ESRD treatment modalities--living related donor (LRD), four-antigen match, LRD two-antigen match, and cadaver (CAD) transplantation; and home peritoneal dialysis (HPD), home hemodialysis (HHD), and facility hemodialysis (FHD)--and for three categories of patients--patients with diabetes, patients over age 60, and patients in general. There was overall agreement in the ranking of treatments by the nephrologists from all three regions for each of the three patient categories; however, significant differences were noted between regions in preferences for certain modalities. Comparison within and between regions revealed striking disparities between preferences and practice. Analysis of these findings provides important insights into the process of ESRD treatment selection and identifies issues that merit further consideration.\r"

Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of whether renal function deteriorated (14 patients) or remained stable (13 patients). At presentation or during the course of the disease, heavy proteinuria, macroscopic hematuria, and high quantitative urinary red cell or white cell counts characterized patients with progressive disease. Patients with crescents on their initial renal biopsy or with large numbers of polymorphs in glomerular capillaries corresponding with sterile pyuria were more likely to have deterioration of renal function. The average time from onset of symptoms to development of end-stage renal disease was over 16 years. The patient's clinical course could not be anticipated by serum complement profiles, the presence of C3 nephritic factor, or partial lipodystrophy. Pregnancy did not affect the course of the disease. Six patients underwent renal transplantation and the disease recurred on renal biopsy in four. However, only two individuals lost renal allografts due to recurrent DDD.\r"

Two new mutant acid alpha-glucosidase alleles were discovered. In two infantile patients from a consanguineous Indian family we found for the first time an acid alpha-glucosidase precursor of reduced size. The mutant precursor appeared normally glycosylated and phosphorylated but was not processed to mature enzyme. Abnormalities of the mRNA were not obvious, but digestion of genomic DNA with HindIII, BglII, and StuI revealed for each enzyme a fragment of increased length. Heterozygosity was demonstrated in the parents. Complete lack of acid alpha-glucosidase mRNA, as well as deficiency of precursor synthesis, was observed in two black baby girls from unrelated families. In these cases the length of all restriction-enzyme fragments was normal. Reduced enzyme synthesis but normal processing was registered in juvenile and young adult Cape colored patients. The extensive heterogeneity of glycogenosis type II is emphasized in these studies on various ethnic groups. The newly discovered mutants are valuable for the understanding of clinical diversity as a result of allelic variation.\r"

If this muscle donor were a gonadal mosaic, this conclusion would be incorrect. In the present study, only those myogenic colonies expressing the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-A isozyme were found to express dystrophin, indicating that this woman was indeed a heterozygote for DMD. By documenting dystrophin deficiency in a specific population of myogenic cells from this woman, we verify our previous conclusion regarding the normal proliferative capacity of DMD myoblasts. Somatic cell testing of dystrophin expression may offer an alternative to established genetic carrier tests for those women in whom deletions of the DMD are not detectable, whose pedigree structure does not permit linkage analysis, or in whom standard phenotypic analyses are ambiguous.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The somatostatin analogue SMS-201-995 has recently been introduced as a new therapy for postprandial hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy. The present study was performed to determine the effect of SMS-201-995 on the adrenergic response to glucose ingestion in patients with this disorder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with postprandial hypotension were studied: six with central autonomic dysfunction (multiple system atrophy) and five with peripheral sympathetic dysfunction (progressive autonomic failure). Patients received either a subcutaneous injection of SMS-201-995 or a placebo injection, immediately before administration of a 50-g glucose drink. Each treatment was given on separate, consecutive days in a randomized fashion. RESULTS: Glucose ingestion caused a decrease in blood pressure (from 82 +/- 6 mm Hg to 66 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and an increase in plasma norepinephrine level (165 +/- 20 pg/mL to 305 +/- 85 pg/mL, p less than 0.01) in five patients with progressive autonomic failure. Administration of SMS-201-995 prevented both the decline in blood pressure and the increase in norepinephrine. By contrast, glucose ingestion elicited no increase in plasma norepinephrine levels despite profound hypotension (average postprandial mean blood pressure, 55 +/- 3 mm Hg) in six patients with multiple system atrophy. Administration of SMS-201-995 prevented postprandial hypotension in these patients, but had no effect on plasma norepinephrine. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the pressor effect of SMS-201-995 is independent of the sympathetic nervous system in patients with multiple system atrophy, but may suppress the adrenergic response to glucose ingestion in patients with progressive autonomic failure.\r"

  ".W": "The factors controlling competence of the gastroesophageal junction have been carefully analyzed over the last decade. Although the presence of an anatomic sphincter guarding the lower esophagus has not been confirmed in humans, a manometrically defined high-pressure zone is present in the lower esophagus. The magnitude of sphincter pressure correlates well with the incidence of pathologic gastroesophageal reflux. Another important determinant of cardial competence is the length of intra-abdominal esophagus. The interaction of length and pressure in maintaining competence is demonstrated by several clinical and experimental studies. Twenty percent of refluxors have normal components of cardial competence. Several physical factors, namely components of Laplace's law, may govern control of reflux especially after antireflux repairs. The occurrence of esophagitis as a complication of gastroesophageal reflux is determined by the ability of the esophageal body to rid itself of an acid load as well as by factors that delay gastric emptying.\r"

In 1987, AIDS deaths accounted for 9% of the total mortality among men 25 to 34 years of age. Projections suggest that the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on morbidity and mortality in young adults and children will continue to increase, with an estimated 50,000 cases projected to be diagnosed in 1989. The mean latency period between infection and diagnosis of AIDS is estimated to be more than seven years, and 78% to 100% of persons infected with HIV are predicted to develop AIDS within 15 years of onset of infection. Rates of seroconversions have been decreasing since 1984 among cohorts of homosexual HIV-seronegative men, and the proportion of AIDS cases among homosexual men is decreasing. In contrast, the proportion of AIDS cases attributed to intravenous drug use is increasing, with 33% of AIDS cases reported in 1988 occurring among intravenous drug users, their sex partners, or children of women who are intravenous drug users or sex partners of intravenous drug users. Worldwide, the differences in the epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS are primarily due to differences in the proportions of the modes of transmission and in the time in which HIV infection was introduced.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Lower extremity infections in the presence vascular insufficiency are difficult and costly to treat. Few well-controlled clinical trials evaluating the management of these infections exist. We decided to investigate the ability of a new fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin, to reduce the morbidity associated with these infections and the amount of in-hospital time required for the administration of antibiotic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with peripheral vascular disease (46 with diabetes mellitus) who presented to the hospital for treatment of lower extremity infections were randomized in a blinded fashion to receive oral ciprofloxacin at a dosage of either 750 mg or 1,000 mg twice daily. Patients with osteomyelitis received three months of therapy and those with infections limited to soft tissues, three weeks of ciprofloxacin treatment. All subjects were followed for one year. RESULTS: One patient received an amputation 24 hours after enrollment, and two patients discontinued therapy after 20 and 34 days because of adverse effects and were not evaluable. At the one-year follow-up, 27 of the 45 (60 percent) evaluable patients had a fully successful outcome defined as not requiring either repeat antimicrobial therapy for their initial infection or amputation of the involved extremity. In the group of 18 patients in whom therapy failed, a total of only nine amputations were required. In the 15 patients whose lesion closed during therapy, 93% (14 patients) experienced a long-term successful outcome. CONCLUSION: Treatment with this new fluoroquinolone offers promise for the improved outcome of patients with the serious infectious complication of infected lower extremity ulcerations in peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or both.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Four previous studies comparing netilmicin and amikacin have yielded inconclusive results concerning efficacy and rates of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. For this reason, we conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of the two drugs in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 202 patients were enrolled in the study; 100 received netilmicin and 102 received amikacin. Concomitant antimicrobials were restricted to metronidazole and benzylpenicillin. Peak and trough aminoglycoside levels were assayed within the first 36 hours and at least every 72 hours thereafter. A full blood cell count, serum electrolytes, creatinine, bilirubin, and liver enzymes were measured before therapy, weekly thereafter, and within 48 hours after the discontinuation of therapy. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were assessed in patients. A standard agar dilution procedure was used to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. RESULTS: No significant pretreatment differences were found between the two groups. Patients in the amikacin group responded significantly better to treatment than did patients in the netilmicin group (90% versus 79%; p less than 0.05). A notable finding was the markedly inferior response rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections to netilmicin as compared with amikacin (13 of 24 with a favorable response compared with 25 of 26). No significant difference in ototoxicity was found, whereas nephrotoxicity appeared to be significantly less with amikacin (4% versus 12%, p less than 0.05). Although amikacin seemed less nephrotoxic than netilmicin, this may have been related to the significantly greater number of patients with initial renal dysfunction who received netilmicin. CONCLUSIONS: Amikacin appears to be significantly more efficacious than netilmicin for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections, especially those in non-urinary tract sites. There is no apparent difference between the two drugs in terms of ototoxicity.\r"

The incisions were evaluated on postoperative days 0, 4, 7, 14, and 21. The ensuing scars were similar with respect to scar width and the amount of collagen in the scar. Foreign body reaction, denoted by histiocytes and giant cells, was significantly more pronounced in the electromicrosurgery group. Carbon particles, along with necrotic debris, appear to induce a foreign body tissue reaction.

In the appropriate-for-gestational-age fetuses plasma insulin and the insulin/glucose ratio increased exponentially with gestation, reflecting the progressive maturation of the pancreas. Maternal blood glucose concentration, not fetal plasma insulin, was the major determinant of fetal blood glucose concentration. In some small-for-gestational-age fetuses hypoinsulinemia and hypoglycemia were found; the two were significantly correlated. However, the fetal insulin/glucose ratio was lower in small-for-gestational-age fetuses than in appropriate-for-gestational-age ones, suggesting that hypoinsulinemia in a small-for-gestational-age fetuses is not only the result of hypoglycemia but also a consequence of pancreatic dysfunction. The degree of fetal smallness did not correlate with plasma insulin or with the insulin/glucose ratio. These findings suggest that insulin may influence fetal growth through its action on nutrient uptake and utilization but it is not the primary determinant of fetal size.\r"

This retrospective review compares the operative and perioperative morbidity in 107 patients who underwent reconstruction with that in 44 patients who did not have reconstruction. With incorporation of the reconstructive procedure, there were no increases in operating time, blood loss, or length of hospitalization. Before 1980, 65% of patients experienced prolapse of the neovagina; in 25% it was severe. The frequency of prolapse has since been decreased to 16% (6% severe) because of several modifications to the initial technique. Modifications have included using smaller flaps, anchoring the neovagina to the levator and retropubic fascia, and, when necessary for mobilization, ligating the neurovascular pedicle. With these modifications, 66% of patients also remained free of wound breakdown or necrosis. The frequency of severe necrosis has decreased from 24% to 13%. The anatomic result of the vaginal reconstructions appears to have been enhanced by these changes in technique.\r"

  ".U": "89270659\r", 
  ".W": "Most sacrococcygeal teratomas diagnosed before birth can be managed by planned delivery and postnatal surgery. However, large tumors early in gestation may result in placentomegaly, hydrops, and fetal death and a preeclampsia-like syndrome in the mother. This chain of events may result from high output cardiac failure in the fetus caused by arteriovenous shunting through the tumor. We recently encountered this situation in a fetus at 21 weeks' gestation and performed fetal surgery in an attempt to reverse the process. Excision of the teratoma resulted in reversal of hydrops, diminution of descending aortic flow on Doppler echocardiography, and decrease in placental thickness. Despite these changes, uterine irritability after hysterotomy resulted in labor and delivery of a nonviable premature infant. This case demonstrates that when fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma becomes very large early in gestation, high output cardiac failure can endanger both fetus and mother. In the future, use of Doppler echocardiography may allow appropriate selection of high-risk fetuses. Intervention to prevent arteriovenous shunting through the tumor may offer these fetuses an improved chance for survival.\r"

The latter group received weekly cervical examinations and instruction regarding subtle symptoms and signs of preterm labor. Medical providers received similar instruction. There was no difference in preterm births between control and intervention groups (20.8% vs. 22.1%). Medical providers, convinced of preterm birth prevention during year 1 of the study, defeated the study design by giving preterm birth precautions to all patients. In turn, preterm births decreased from 13.7% (year 1) to 9.3% (year 2, p less than 0.001) and remained stable in year 3 (8.7%). Preterm births during year 1 and the 8 months preceding year 1 were not different. Significant differences in preterm births between private and indigent study patients during these two periods (p less than 0.001) disappeared during years 2 and 3 of the study.\r"

Because previous reports have shown an association between choroid plexus cysts and chromosomal anomalies, we analyzed 82 prenatally diagnosed cases, 65 of whom had chromosome analysis performed. Of the group, 6.2% had chromosomal anomalies of the trisomy 18 type. The remaining 17 cases were clinically normal at birth. These cases of trisomy 18 were also associated with multiple structural anomalies. Therefore, we suggest that after the diagnosis of choroid plexus cysts is made, a complete ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy be performed. Fetal karyotype determination may be offered to patients, especially in the presence of structural anomalies.\r"

The obstetric records and sonograms of patients with documented leiomyomas were reviewed and compared with data from matched control patients managed at our institution during the same time period. Among the 93 patients with leiomyomas, 14 (15.1%) had one or more leiomyomas subjacent to the maternal surface of the placenta. Significantly, eight of 14 (57%) of these patients with retroplacental leiomyomas subsequently developed abruptio placentae, which resulted in the deaths of four fetuses. Conversely, among the remaining 79 patients whose leiomyomas were not retroplacental, abruptio placentae occurred in only two patients (2.5%), neither of which resulted in fetal death. Clinically significant pain requiring narcotic analgesia developed in 14 of 93 (15.1%) patients and premature labor occurred in 20 of 93 (21.5%); pain and premature labor correlated positively with the size of the largest myoma. Delivery by cesarean section and vacuum assistance occurred significantly more frequently in patients with leiomyomas than in those without documented leiomyomas. In this population uterine myomas did not significantly alter the incidence of intrauterine growth retardation and low Apgar scores.\r"

Maternal and fetal plasma concentrations of glucose, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin, glucagon, and PaO2, oxygen content, and pH were determined before and at days 1, 3, and 5 after the injection of alloxan. Two animals aborted between days 1 and 3 after alloxan administration. In the other animals, significant changes occurred from baseline to day 5: maternal hyperglycemia (56.8 +/- 5.2 vs. 227.3 +/- 54.6 mg/dl; p less than 0.01), maternal hypoinsulinemia (6.2 +/- 3.5 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.4 microU/ml, p = 0.016); maternal hyperketonemia (beta-hydroxybutyrate: 0.79 +/- 0.27 vs. 4.69 +/- 2.64 mmol/L, p less than 0.01); fetal hyperglycemia (17.0 +/- 2.6 vs. 86.0 +/- 16.2 mg/dl, p less than 0.001); fetal hyperinsulinemia (8.4 +/- 4.5 vs. 19.2 +/- 6.4 microU/ml, p less than 0.001); fetal hyperketonemia (beta-hydroxybutyrate: 0.03 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.02 mmol/L, p less than 0.05); fetal hypoxemia (arterial PO2: 21.6 +/- 1.8 vs. 18.0 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05, and oxygen content: 7.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.5 +/- 1.9 vol/dl, p less than 0.02).

Both patients had focal, discrete patches of retinitis that enlarged slowly over weeks and ultimately accumulated large amounts of subretinal fluid and retinal exudate. One patient underwent retinal biopsy after systemic and vitreous cultures were negative. Histopathologic sections showed necrotic retina infiltrated with multiple histiocytes containing intracytoplasmic, iodine-positive, pleomorphic, encapsulated bacterial forms. The organism was not grown from the retinal biopsy specimen. Treatment with antibiotics resulted in improved vision in both patients. Our results indicate that endogenous bacterial infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retinitis associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

Furthermore, the results of neurophysiological studies in animals suggest that CNS processes generating REM sleep may participate in the control of the classical startle response, which may be akin to the startle behavior commonly described in PTSD patients. Speculating that PTSD may be fundamentally a disorder of REM sleep mechanisms, the authors suggest several strategies for future research.\r"

While she was a medical student and practicing internist, she encountered few comments about her disability, but during her later psychiatry residency, hospitalized psychiatric patients discussed it frequently. The author presents examples and points out that patients' reactions often revealed much about their characteristic response patterns; reactions to her disability became a type of projective test. Her primary defenses against patients' remarks were intellectualization and isolation of affect. Supervisors who were able to discuss the impact of her disability on the doctor-patient relationship were considered most helpful.\r"

  ".W": "The biomechanical effectiveness of the Muller anterolateral femorotibial ligament (ALFTL) iliotibial band tenodesis on anterior stability and internal rotational stability of the ACL deficient knee was investigated in six cadaver knees. Anterior drawer and internal rotation of the tibia were measured at 15 degrees increments from 0 degrees to 90 degrees in response to 50 N of anteriorly applied tibial force and 3 Nm of internally applied internal torque, respectively, in the intact knee, the ACL excised knee, and following the ALFTL reconstruction. A strain gage was used to measure the resting graft tension and to measure strain in the graft during the load-displacement tests. The Muller ALFTL tenodesis failed to return normal anterior stability to the ACL deficient knee (P less than 0.05). The tenodesis did, however, reduce the anterior laxity of the ACL deficient knee from 30 degrees to 90 degrees of knee flexion (P less than 0.05). The tenodesis overconstrained internal tibial rotation of the ACL excised knee from 30 degrees to 90 degrees (P less than 0.05). Measurements of strain in the tenodesis supported the load-displacement findings that the tenodesis was most effective in constraining anterior drawer and internal tibial rotation from 30 degrees to 90 degrees of knee flexion.\r"

Patient selection was based on a history of a failed autologous reconstruction and/or primary repair of the ACL. These selection criteria are unique and have not been previously reported in the literature. The frequency of prior intraarticular ACL surgery was 1.24 procedures per patient and 1.68 when combined with prior extraarticular reconstructions. Forty-one patients had a mean followup of 28 months (24 to 42 months). The mean followup for all of the patients was 21 months. The graft was augmented with autologous tissue in 59 cases and used as a pure prosthesis in the rest. Functionally, the mean Lysholm score improved from 40 to 81 points. The percentage of a combined excellent/good Lysholm rating increased from 6% to 60%. The Tegner activity rating level improved from 2 to 4. The percentage of a negative Lachman sign, anterior drawer, and pivot shift was approximately 75% at followup. There was no significant difference between the results of augmentation and nonaugmentation cases, indicating that the graft acts as a permanent prosthesis rather than as a scaffold or stint. The patients showed a significant improvement considering their preoperative global instability.\r"

The other (VIVAX-1) recombinant is yeast-derived and contains the entire repeat domain and part of the surrounding N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Both antigens were administered with alum and muramyl tripeptide as adjuvants. No formulations caused toxic side effects. Both antigens, when administered with alum, induced high levels of sporozoite antibodies in all animals. Another group of animals was immunized with irradiated sporozoites alone. Upon challenge, a few immunized animals did not develop detectable parasitemia and others developed parasitemia only after a prolonged prepatent period. Monkeys immunized with irradiated sporozoites had higher levels of antibody but no increased protection. There was no correlation between protection and either antibody level or the in vitro proliferation of lymphocytes in response to the antigens. This is the first time P. vivax sporozoite vaccines have been tested in monkeys with a subsequent sporozoite challenge.\r"

Initial infections in splenectomized monkeys were marked by multiple recrudescences. The mutant grew less well than the wild type in the splenectomized monkeys, as determined by lower peak and total parasitemias. In the splenectomized monkeys tested by rechallenge with the wild type parasite, the mutant stimulated a comparable degree of protection. That protection was manifested in 2 ways. There was a marked reduction in the level of the primary parasitemia in the rechallenged monkeys and an absence of recrudescent parasitemias after the primary parasitemia. The potential value of generating and studying temperature sensitive P. falciparum strains that show attenuated growth is considered.\r"

There was a significant decrease in onchocercal involvement which was maintained for at least 3 years.

Further, the severity of scarring at 3 months was compared with the initial measurements. The measurements predicted healing with 100 percent accuracy and failure to heal with 93 percent accuracy. There was also a significant correlation between initial flow measurements and severity of scarring at 3 months. We conclude that heated laser Doppler flow measurements performed early after burn injury are useful in predicting whether healing is likely to occur, as well as the quality of late scar formation; therefore, the method is useful in selecting patients for primary excision and grafting of burn wounds.\r"

Samples of the peritoneal fluid and blood were simultaneously obtained immediately after opening the peritoneal cavity. The mean serum cefazolin concentration was the highest. High peritoneal fluid levels of all three antibiotics were found; however, the antibacterial activity against common intestinal pathogens varied significantly. Cefazolin is the only study drug that possesses marginal in vitro activity against Streptococcus faecalis, a species generally considered resistent to cephalosporins. This study suggests that prophylactic second and third generation cephalosporins are not superior to cefazolin.\r"

The paucity of symptoms in early gastric cancer, the low incidence in the general United States population, and the lack of cost-effective screening methods suggest that improvements in early detection are unlikely. Hope for improved survival in late stage cases lies mostly in a better understanding of the pathophysiology and patterns of spread, in evolving techniques for more accurate perioperative staging, and in the gradually improving results of multimodality therapy for local-regional and systemic disease. A proposal is made for a new staging system integrating newer approaches to staging and for controlled trials of multimodality therapy in patients unlikely to be cured by surgery alone.\r"

During the past few years, the availability of aztreonam (a monobactam), imipenem (a carbapenem), and newer cephalosporins within vitro activities comparable with aminoglycosides against many gram-negative bacilli, has stimulated a reassessment of the role of aminoglycosides in treating these infections. When determining the role of new antimicrobials as potential replacements for more established agents, the clinical focus should be on three factors: comparative efficacy, safety, and cost. Consideration of cost is relevant only when efficacy and safety are equivalent. Other factors, such as comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, and effect on normal flora can also influence the selection of an antimicrobial regimen. A new class of antimicrobials, the monobactams, is the focus of this review. The only member of this class currently in clinical use is aztreonam. A comparison with aminoglycosides is particularly relevant because aztreonam is active against aerobic gram-negative bacilli. This review will discuss the acknowledged concerns with aminoglycoside use and compare the characteristics of aztreonam and currently marketed aminoglycosides.\r"

It is based on a sulfatase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the sulfoconjugates followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase and [methyl-3H]-S-adenosylmethionine-catalyzed O-methylation of the resulting free salsolinol and dopamine. Rapid thin-layer chromatographic separation of the formed labeled metabolites attributed to the specificity of the differential enzymatic assay of salsolinol and dopamine. This assay was used to study plasma salsolinol and dopamine levels in a group of adult males (n = 36) serving as controls and a group of hospitalized chronic alcoholics (n = 18). The results (mean and range) of this preliminary study show that alcoholics had significantly (p less than 0.0001) elevated plasma concentration of salsolinol sulfate (497; 50-1331 pg/ml) as compared to controls (93; 0-232 pg/ml). This was accompanied by significant (p less than 0.0003) elevation in plasma levels of dopamine sulfate. Elevation of plasma salsolinol sulfate reported here may be interpreted as a reflection of abnormalities in oxidative metabolism of dopamine, metabolically derived acetaldehyde, and/or biological carbonyls in chronic alcoholics.\r"

Methionine was effective when given prior to or after the administration of ethanol, but the time course of the action of methionine suggested the necessity for metabolic transformation of this amino acid in order for the acetaldehyde-lowering effect to be evidenced. Studies with humans, given methionine doses of approximately one-tenth of those used with mice, indicated that methionine can also lower acetaldehyde in humans ingesting ethanol. Given the toxic characteristics of acetaldehyde, methionine may prove effective in reducing the damaging effects of ethanol ingestion.\r"

Our results showed that, as the dose exceeded 0.012 g of ethanol per gram of body weight, a significant (p less than 0.001) loss of \"strength\" occurred that was independent of sex according to the relationship, Strength (N) = 140.4 - 6003 dose (g/g). In the present effort, the same flexure tests were reevaluated to include the parameters of stiffness, toughness, and ductility. These latest results confirm that the femurs of rats fed an ethanol liquid diet for 4 weeks are not only weaker but also more compliant and less energy absorbing. Although the femurs of rats fed ethanol are more ductile, the bones are more prone to fracture in fatigue and impact circumstances as well as under simple loading situations. The rat may be an appropriate model to study the mechanisms that lead to the higher incidence of fractures in the alcoholic human.\r"

Consistent with previous correlational research, the above changes were associated with significant increases in Western Australia for male (+24.3%) and female (+29.3%) liver cirrhosis mortality, but a significant decrease in male driver and motorcyclist mortality (-22.1%). Attention is drawn to the value of longitudinal studies to examine both the negative and positive effects of changing the number and type of alcohol outlets.\r"

In generations F24 and F25, samples of 534 and 580 mice from the LSXSS RI strains were tested for fall time, sleep time, and blood ethanol at awakening subsequent to intraperitoneal injection of a 4.1-g/kg body weight dose of ethanol. Approximately 2 weeks later, mice from F24 were also tested for body temperature lowering and blood-ethanol elimination rate (beta 60). Differences among the average ethanol-induced sleep-time scores of the RI strains are large (ranging from 36 to 171 min) and account for over 50% of the observed variance. Effects due to generation, sex, litters within strains, and the interaction between strain and generation are also significant, but account for relatively small proportions of the total variance. Quantitative genetic analyses of these data suggest that differences in sleep-time scores are polygenic; however, allelic differences at the albino (c) locus may have a pleiotropic effect. Genetic correlations between sleep time and blood ethanol at awakening (-0.79) and between body temperature 60 min after injection and beta 60 (+0.48) are significant. Because differences among the LSXSS RI strains are large and highly reliable, they should be valuable animal models for testing more searching hypotheses about the etiology of individual differences in ethanol-induced anesthesia.\r"

Immune status was evaluated by means of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity (DCH)-like responses to phytohemagglutinin. The daily consumption of 5 g of ethanol/kg body weight/d resulted in a prompt reduction in DCH-like responses which was significant by Day 3 (p = 0.03) and maximal by Day 11 (45% of baseline). These data were consistent with a similar reduction of migration inhibitory factor activity in spleen cells from ethanol fed rats. Cessation of ethanol resulted in a return to baseline within 4 days. In a second experiment ethanol was administered daily in doses ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 g/kg. Early (Day 5) low dose ethanol (0.5-2 g/kg) stimulated immune response (153-188% of baseline) while high dose (6.0 g/kg) suppressed (79% of baseline). Continued treatments resulted in a loss of stimulation at low dose and increased suppression at higher doses. The relationship of these animal studies to human binge drinking and the possible risk for infection in the alcoholic remains to be established.\r"

In order to examine these possibilities, indigo carmine was injected into the bladder of 19-day fetuses previously exposed to ethanol on Day 10 of gestation and the presence of hydronephrosis and/or reflux determined. As expected, we found a greatly increased incidence of hydronephrosis and hydroureter. In addition, there was a significant increase in reflux in the ethanol-treated mice. The incidence of reflux appeared to be related to the severity of the hydronephrosis observed, though cases of hydronephrosis without reflux and reflux without hydronephrosis were found. These data suggest both hypotheses may be salient and that a multiplicity of urogenital abnormalities are found following prenatal ethanol exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Morphometric procedures were used to quantitate changes induced by ethanol in tissue components of rat mammary gland. Rats were pair-fed ethanol-containing or isocaloric control liquid diets formulated for pregnant or lactating animals, or maintained on regular laboratory chow. Short term animals were pair-fed ethanol or control diets from Day 1 of pregnancy through lactation Days 2 or 10. Long term animals were pair-fed ethanol or control diets for 25 days prior to mating, and then through pregnancy to lactation Days 2 or 10. Point counting was used to determine the volume fractions (vf) of alveolar epithelium, lumen, and connective tissue in the mammary glands. In chow-fed animals the percentage of alveolar epithelium remained constant from late pregnancy through lactation, while the amount of connective tissue decreased and that of alveolar lumen increased. This indicates the sensitivity of this procedure to detect changes in tissue volume fractions during mammary proliferation. No changes from the normal controls were found in any tissue component in short term ethanol or pair-fed animals. At lactation Day 2, long term ethanol-treated animals demonstrated a significant decrease in the percentage of alveolar epithelium and a significant increase in the percentage of total connective tissue as compared to pair-fed and chow-fed control animals. However, by Day 10 of lactation, no changes were found in any of the tissue components in long-term ethanol-fed versus control animals. These results indicate that ethanol consumption can alter mammary gland structure during the early stages of lactation, even when adequate levels of dietary protein are maintained.\r"

Patients were excluded from this study if they had clinical brain (including Wernicke's) disease, died in coma, had liver disease, significant brain atrophy, or dementia severe enough to require institutionalization. We found that muscarinic cholinergic synaptic receptor density determined with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate was decreased by 40% in homogenates of the putamen of 27 alcohol abusers compared with 37 matched nonalcoholic controls. In contrast, receptor densities and affinities of benzodiazepine receptors determined with [3H]flunitrazepam were not significantly different in the two groups. Age and death-autopsy time interval had no significant effects on either wet tissue protein concentrations, yields of protein after centrifugation, or receptor binding. The contributions of age and time interval were each less than 3% of the total variance of protein concentrations and receptor binding. When patients who had received cholinergic, anticholinergic, or benzodiazepine medications before death were excluded or included we observed no significant effects on the final results. Pneumonia, known to be associated with acute hypoxia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, known to be associated with chronic hypoxia, were approximately equally distributed between the two groups and had no significant effects on the results reported here. It is significant that the loss of muscarinic and the sparing of benzodiazepine receptors in the putamen occurs in histologically normal brains in the absence of significant atrophy and gross dementia. It implies that these changes are early in the development of alcoholic encephalopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results indicate that there is an increase in plasma prolactin levels together with a reduction in basal plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, which are evident from the beginning of the intoxication period. An exaggerated response of LH to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone was also evident from 2nd week on, in ethanol-treated rats. Basal and human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated plasma testosterone levels were decreased in alcohol-treated as compared to control rats, at all time points studied. In addition, plasma estradiol levels were increased in ethanol-fed rats. These data suggest a direct suppressive effect of ethanol on LH release in the beginning of the intoxication period. Subsequent elevations of plasma estradiol and prolactin levels may have contributed to the maintenance of hypogonadism at the end of the intoxication period.\r"

Ethanol groups had smaller fetuses than control groups, regardless of their dietary B6 levels. However, in B6 deficiency, ethanol affected fetal weight more severely than in B6 adequate state. Tissue PLP levels were determined by radioenzymatic method. In B6 deficiency, ethanol feeding reduced maternal liver PLP by 22%. PLP in other tissues were not affected by ethanol. These results confirmed that chronic alcohol consumption affected fetal growth and also provided evidence that B6 deficiency exacerbated ethanol effect.\r"

Marker enzymes were measured in all fractions. The highest concentration of alpha-tocopherol was found in the light mitochondrial fraction both in ethanol-fed and control rats, 754 +/- 104 and 1127 +/- 126 pmol/mg protein, respectively. The microsomal, heavy mitochondrial, and nuclear fractions also had high concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, whereas the cytosolic fraction contained minor amounts. In the light mitochondrial fraction we found the highest concentration of alpha-tocopherol in lysosomes, whereas small amounts were detected in peroxisomes. In the microsomal fraction the highest concentration was found in the Golgi apparatus. The content of alpha-tocopherol in the light mitochondrial fraction was reduced by 33% (p less than 0.02) in the ethanol-fed group as compared to the controls. In the other fractions no significant differences between the two groups were observed. Long term administration of ethanol promoted, however, a further enrichment of alpha-tocopherol (178% higher than controls) in the Golgi apparatus, possibly due to reduced secretion of very low density lipoprotein-associated alpha-tocopherol.\r"

In this study, we further characterized these impairments by identifying the time of onset for ethanol-induced changes in RME as well as establishing the time course for recovery to normal endocytotic values after ethanol withdrawal. Ethanol administration for 3 days did not alter any aspect of endocytosis examined in this study. After feeding ethanol to rats for 7 days, however, significant decreases in amounts of ligand bound, internalized, and degraded were apparent. These impairments persisted throughout the 5-week feeding study although the effects were somewhat attenuated with more prolonged ethanol feeding. In addition, an accumulation of intracellular receptors was observed in ethanol-fed animals relative to controls after 7 days of ethanol feeding. In all cases, recovery of endocytotic values to control levels was partially completed after 2 to 3 days of refeeding control diet and was fully completed after 7 days of refeeding. These results indicate that ethanol feeding for as little as 7 days profoundly impairs the process of RME by the liver. These impairments can be reversed after refeeding control diet for 7 days.\r"

Alcoholics receiving standard medical treatment (abstinence, group psychotherapy, antidepressants) showed a significant elevation in serum beta-endorphin levels at the conclusion of the experiment. This neuropeptide is an index of stress and a stimulant of caloric (e.g., ethanol) intake. Application of brainwave treatment, a relaxation therapy, appears to counteract the increase in circulating beta-endorphin levels seen in the control group of alcoholics. 13-month follow-up data indicate sustained prevention of relapse in alcoholics that completed alpha-theta brainwave training.\r"

  ".W": "Mitochondrial function appears to be an early target for ethanol toxicity, however it is not clear to what extent the effects of ethanol, which occur at levels of intake lower than those already reported in the literature, can induce an alteration of it. To produce different levels of ethanol intake, the spontaneous consumption of ethanol by genetically low (UChA) and genetically high (UChB) rats, as well as the forced intake obtained by offering 10% v/v ethanol solution as the only source of drinking fluid, were employed. The O2 uptake by liver mitochondria of rats submitted to these conditions in the presence of glutamate + malate, succinate or ascorbate + TMPD, was measured polarographically with a Clark electrode at 25 degrees C. Results indicate that alterations of the hepatic mitochondrial function can be detected at levels of ethanol intake much lower than those previously reported. Whereas, a level of a daily ethanol intake of 2-3 g/kg body weight in UChA rats under free choice was insufficient to produce detectable changes in the mitochondrial function, the latter was decreased in the high ethanol consumers (UChB), which drank 4-5 g/kg per day under free choice conditions, and in both strains forced to drink 10% ethanol as only source of fluid, which produced intakes of about 7 g/kg per day. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to effects observed even at low levels of ethanol intake.\r"

Twenty-two healthy male volunteers were tested under the influence of 0.8 g/kg ethanol and compared to 22 matched controls receiving a placebo drink. Stress was induced by mental arithmetic applied prior to and 45 min after fluid consumption. Plasma epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) obtained from an indwelling cannula inserted 50 min prior to stress application were determined prior to and after each stress session. Percentage changes were compared within and between groups and correlated with respective changes of emotional states and performance in mental arithmetic. While ethanol decreased performance and stress-related emotional arousal, it did not affect stress-induced changes in plasma catecholamines. Rather, the fluid (ethanol as well as placebo) increased NE levels. Emotional tension reduction was associated with low resting or average levels of E in the placebo group but this relationship was disrupted by ethanol. High NE resting levels and drink induced increases predicted emotional tension reduction with placebo but an increase in stress induced depression with alcohol. \"Biochemical tension reduction\" (represented by both reduced E and NE stress response) may be predicted from generally lower levels of activation and elation by alcohol but not with the placebo condition. Although performance was positively related to low NE resting levels and stress responses, no influence of alcohol on this relationship was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bacteria and their products are involved in triggering the production and release of TNF. Alcohol consumption is known to suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of acute ethanol administration on the ability of endotoxin to increase circulating TNF levels and to determine the relationship between blood ethanol levels and endotoxin-induced serum TNF. A 50% decrease in serum TNF levels was seen 1-1.5 h after endotoxin challenge in conscious rats with blood alcohol levels between 75-175 mg/dl. A dose-related depression of serum TNF was observed with increasing blood alcohol levels. This was accompanied by a markedly diminished hyperlactacidemia seen following endotoxin administration. These data suggest that impaired TNF release may have a role in the altered immune response of alcoholics to infection.\r"

When succinylcholine is used as the substrate and the product choline assayed by choline oxidase-peroxidase-quinone dye colorimetry, the rate of the choline production as optical density change was reduced to 50% by 19.5 X 10(-6) M metoclopramide at 20 degrees C. Prolongation of neuromuscular blockade produced by concurrent administration of succinylcholine and metoclopramide was studied in 22 patients aged between 18 and 40 years undergoing elective gynecological surgery. EMG activity in the adductor pollicis muscle was recorded in response to a train-of-four (TOF) stimulus delivered every 10 s. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: A and B. In both groups, anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with sufentanil and nitrous oxide. Tracheal intubation followed intravenous succinylcholine. Intraoperatively, after returning of neuromuscular function, patients in both groups received 20 mg succinylcholine for the determination of duration of neuromuscular blockade. Time from 95% suppression of baseline twitch following a 20 mg increment of succinylcholine until recovery to 25% of control activity was determined. Thereafter, in group A, patients receive metoclopramide (10 mg iv) followed by succinylcholine 20 mg iv, and patients in group B received succinylcholine 20 mg iv alone. Recovery times were again measured and found to be prolonged in patients receiving metoclopramide compared with those not receiving metoclopramide (P less than 0.05). Metoclopramide has no intrinsic neuromuscular blocking activity, but its ability to inhibit plasma cholinesterase probably is the mechanism by which it prolongs succinylcholine block. Reducing the dose of succinylcholine may be appropriate when metoclopramide is given concurrently.\r"

Of the 28 patients given a full loading dose, 20 (71.4%) achieved a postload therapeutic level (10 to 20 micrograms/mL), and none developed a toxic level (greater than 20 micrograms/mL). Although 34 (60.7%) of 56 patients given a half loading dose attained a postload therapeutic level, 13 patients (23.2%) entered the toxic range. We were able to predict that loading doses of 7.6 mg/kg and 3.8 mg/kg based on ideal body weight (IBW) would have yielded very similar results. The mean change in theophylline level per mg/kg TBW of administered aminophylline was 2.01 micrograms/mL. When calculated on the basis of IBW, the mean change in theophylline level was 1.58 micrograms/mL. Evaluation of the change in theophylline level resulting from aminophylline loading doses based on either TBW or IBW revealed that each dosing method produced changes in blood level with similar variability that were not independent of obesity, indicating that neither dosing method is superior to the other. Thus, patients who report not having taken a theophylline preparation within the above time limits can be given a full aminophylline loading dose of either 6 mg/kg based on TBW or 7.6 mg/kg based on IBW. Other patients, however, require a preload blood level determination to optimize therapy and avoid toxic levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Airway cells were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Lung wall cells were prepared via collagenase digestion of lung tissue slices. Acute exposure to LPS triggered the influx within 4 to 12 h of equivalent numbers (approximately 70 x 10(6)) of neutrophils into the lung walls of both CV and SPF guinea pigs. The recruited neutrophils then proceeded into the airways of CV animals, and by 48 h all recruited neutrophils were recoverable by BAL. In contrast, only one third of recruited neutrophils in the lungs of SPF animals moved from the lung wall into the airways. Analysis of neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) production identified lung wall cells as the major source of LPS-induced NCF activity in both groups and as virtually the sole source in SPF animals. The results emphasize the importance of studies on the precise lung tissue distribution of both recruited neutrophils, and endogenous NCF-producing cells, in elucidating the acute inflammatory response in the lungs.\r"

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effect of a new anticholinergic agent, oxitropium bromide, on bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled propranolol in seven subjects with mild asthma 24 to 39 yr of age. Inhaled propranolol induced long-lasting reduction in specific airway conductance (SGaw) in all subjects. This was associated with airway beta-adrenoceptor blockade as demonstrated by a shift in the isoproterenol dose-response curve. Propranolol was less potent than methacholine, with a geometric mean dose causing a 35% fall in SGaw of 4.7 mumol for propranolol compared with 0.48 mumol for methacholine. Pretreatment with oxitropium 200 micrograms completely inhibited the fall in SGaw in response to inhaled propranolol in all subjects. Oxitropium also revealed PIB. Cholinergic receptor blockade by oxitropium inhibits bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled propranolol, supporting involvement of cholinergic mechanisms in PIB.\r"

The effect of combined hypercapnia and hypoxia was studied in vitro using hamster diaphragm strips. A 12% CO2, 21% O2, and 67% N2 gas mixture was used to produce hypoxic, hypercapnic acidosis. Force-frequency curves were generated using twitches and maximal tetanic contractions produced by stimulating with 0.2-ms pulses at 10 to 120 Hz for 300 to 500 ms. Moderate fatigue was then induced by repeated submaximal contractions (25 Hz, 160 ms, at the rate of 1/s for 45 contractions). Muscle strips exposed to hypoxic, hypercapnic acidosis had a decreased force response at all frequencies. The decrease in force was not different from that seen with hypoxia alone but was significantly worse than with hypercapnia alone. In the combined hypercapnic, hypoxia solution, tension produced by stimulating at 25 Hz for 160 ms was decreased to 52 +/- 11% of control (p less than 0.001). For these submaximal contractions, hypercapnic acidosis had a greater negative inotropic effect than did hypoxia alone. With repeated contractions, tension declined at a faster rate than in control, hypoxia alone, or hypercapnia alone. In the combined hypoxic, hypercapnic solution, the time constant of relaxation (tau) was increased prior to the start of the fatigue run compared to the control (tau = 35 +/- 6 versus 45 +/- 5 ms; p less than 0.001), and the tau increased at a faster rate than in control. These studies suggest that hypoxic, hypercapnic acidosis has a greater detrimental effect on the muscle than either abnormality alone and makes the muscle more susceptible to fatigue.\r"

Body weight was directly related to FEV1 (p = 0.0001), so that all subsequent analyses of body weight had to first consider FEV1. Mortality appeared to be influenced by body weight independent of FEV1. In patients with %FEV1 less than 35, mortality increased with decreasing body weight (p = 0.093), and this relationship was stronger in patients with %FEV1 35 to 47 (p = 0.048) and even stronger in patients with %FEV1 greater than 47 (p = 0.007). After adjusting for FEV1, body weight was a powerful positive correlate with exercise capacity (p = 0.0001). Body weight was also inversely related to %TLC (p = 0.0408) after adjusting for FEV1. Body weight was a powerful predictor of diffusing capacity (p = 0.0001) in patients with the same FEV1. These results support the hypothesis that factors related to nutritional status are an independent influence on the course of COPD.\r"

We have applied the DI as well as conventional assessments of emphysema-panel grading (emphysema score), mean linear intercept (Lm), and internal surface area at a volume of 5 L (ISA5) - to the lungs of patients in the National Institutes of Health Intermittent Positive Pressure Breathing Trial, which admitted patients with moderate to severe chronic airflow obstruction. In the 41 patients with satisfactory morphologic material who died and were autopsied, the DI was significantly correlated with emphysema score (p less than 0.001), Lm (p less than 0.001), and ISA5 (p less than 0.001). There was a rapid increase in the DI between emphysema scores of 30 and 60; when the DI reached a score of about 90, it did not increase much further. A wide spread of the DI from 23.7 to 86.5 was present in lungs with a Lm of less than 0.55 mm. The DI was well related to the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (p less than 0.001) and %TLC (p less than 0.01), but not to %FEV1, slope of phase III (phase III), nor recoil pressure at 90% of TLC (P90). The correlations between emphysema score and either DLCO or %TLC were about the same as for the DI. Also, correlations were significant for %FEV1, phase III, and P90. Lesions of bronchioles had no correlation with the DI. We therefore conclude that the DI is related to conventional assessments of emphysema, but beyond an emphysema score of 55 or a Lm of 0.55 mm, it does not discriminate emphysema severity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The etiology of the injuries were gunshot wounds (22), blunt trauma (11), shotgun wounds (4), and stab wounds (4). Associated injuries included fractures (67%), popliteal vein (54%), and nerves (32%). Arterial repairs consisted of primary repair (19), lateral repair (1), saphenous vein grafts (13), and saphenous vein patching (1). Five patients received polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. Fasciotomy was performed in 27 limbs. The associated venous injuries (21) and isolated venous injuries (3) were managed with ligation (14), primary repair (9), and vein patch (1). The amputation rate was 11 per cent for popliteal artery injuries (4/34). No other amputations were required. All four amputations were associated with massive limb injury (3) or diagnostic delay (1). One patient died during hemodialysis for renal failure resulting from prolonged shock and myoglobinuria. Successful management correlates best with prompt repair of both popliteal arterial and venous injuries and early fasciotomy. Vein repair (vs ligation) is associated with better long-term results.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the transmission of infectious agents from organ donors to transplant recipients, and to assess risk factors for transmission, primarily in recipients of kidney, cornea, and heart allografts. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Computerized literature searches of MEDLINE and PAPERCHASE through January 1988, extensive review of references from identified articles, and review of major clinical and transplantation journals through June 1988. STUDY SELECTION: All case reports and studies that reported a possible donor-to-recipient transmission of infection were selected and reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Each case report or patient series of donor-to-recipient transmission was judged as possible, probable, or proven depending on the completeness of donor and recipient information available and the likelihood of alternate causes of infection. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: True donor-transmitted infection can occur with viruses including human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, rabies, the virus causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and with hepatitis B virus. It can also occur with many common aerobic bacteria, although allograft-transmitted bacterial infection is more often caused by contamination during harvesting and processing. Fungi and yeast, as well as toxoplasmosis, have been transmitted less frequently, and there have been rare instances when mycobacterial infection, malaria, trypanosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis have been transplanted with the donor organ. CONCLUSIONS: Infection can be transmitted with a donor organ to the recipient, but contamination of the organ during processing and harvesting is commoner and may lead to severe infection in the recipient, especially if contamination is by one of a subset of more virulent organisms. True donor-transmitted infection, although rare, can be reduced by careful donor screening, which should include clinical and epidemiologic assessment for evidence of infection, as well as judicious laboratory testing.\r"

However, effective antihypertensive therapy has not consistently reduced the incidence of cardiac events in the major trials of treatment for mild hypertension. In reviewing these trials and the recent data on the pathophysiologic interrelationships among hypertension, atherosclerosis, and myocardial ischemia, two factors stand out: First, the power of these trials to produce a positive result was limited because of their size, entry criteria, duration, and other considerations; second, autopsy and epidemiologic data suggest that some patients in these trials probably had advanced coronary artery disease at the time of entry. Because these patients probably developed symptomatic coronary artery disease by virtue of this pre-existing disease, the failure of antihypertensive therapy alone to prevent cardiac events in trials of relatively short duration should not be construed as evidence against its value as a long-term therapy.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Emergency rooms of three university and four community hospitals. PATIENTS: Emergency room patients (7734) with acute chest pain. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Only 261 (23%) of 1118 patients with acute myocardial infarctions were 75 years of age or younger, presented within 4 hours of the onset of pain, and had emergency room electrocardiograms showing probable acute myocardial infarction: 60 (0.9%) of the 6616 patients without infarction also met these criteria (positive predictive value, 261/321 = 81%; CI, 77% to 86%). The positive predictive value could increase to about 88% (CI, 82% to 93%) if eligibility were based on the official hospital electrocardiogram reading. CONCLUSIONS: Because experience from published studies suggests that about one third of patients who meet these three eligibility criteria have other contraindications to thrombolysis, we estimate that about 15% of patients with acute myocardial infarction would meet the criteria for eligibility for thrombolysis that have been used in clinical trials at the time of emergency room presentation. Further, for every eight patients with true-positive results who are treated, one to two patients with false-positive results may also be treated if decisions are based on the interpretation of a single electrocardiogram.\r"

DESIGN: The G-CSF was administered by daily subcutaneous injection to outpatients in a phase I-II trial. Dose was escalated every 2 weeks between 0.1 to 3.0 micrograms/kg body weight.d over an 8-week treatment period. SETTING: Outpatient clinical research center at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve consecutive patients with myelodysplastic syndromes: two refractory anemia, seven refractory anemia with excess of blasts, three refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In 10 of 12 patients, elevations in blood leukocyte counts (2- to 10-fold) and absolute neutrophil counts (5- to 40-fold) were seen over the 8-week treatment period. Five of seven severely neutropenic patients (absolute neutrophil count, less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L) had a rise in count to 1.2 to 16.3 x 10(9)/L. Increased reticulocyte counts occurred in 5 patients, and were associated with decreased transfusion requirements in 2 of 9 erythrocyte transfusion-dependent patients. Treatment with G-CSF enhanced marrow myeloid cell maturation in 9 of 11 evaluable patients. Neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis in vitro were improved or unchanged after treatment in 6 of 8 patients tested. In 11 of 12 patients, there were no substantial changes in platelet, lymphocyte, eosinophil, or monocyte counts. Three responding patients initially had abnormal cytogenetics that persisted after G-CSF therapy, suggesting induced differentiation of the abnormal clone. The therapy was associated with minimal toxicity. None of the patients' conditions converted to acute leukemia during treatment or in short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with G-CSF administered by subcutaneous injection is well tolerated and effective for improving the neutropenia, and less commonly the transfusion-dependent anemia, over 6 to 8 weeks in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States with 250,000 cases per year. Cerebral ischemia is the largest category of stroke with cardiac arrest, profound hypotension, and vascular occlusion the principal causes. Traditional approaches to the treatment of ischemic stroke focus on maintaining cardiac output, blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, and on preventing thrombosis. Recently, attention has been focused on developing new therapies that are directed toward abnormal biochemical events at excitatory synapses. Ischemia causes impairment of brain energy metabolism and the release of excessive amounts of glutamate into the extracellular space. This process secondarily excites neurons and further depletes energy stores. The excitotoxic hypothesis of brain injury proposes that glutamate is a principal cause of damage in ischemia. Three components of this hypothesis have been tested and largely proved in experimental studies in tissue culture and in animal models of stroke. First, elevated concentrations of glutamate cause excessive excitation at a subset of glutamate receptors, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Second, excitation at this receptor leads to excessive influx of sodium chloride and water which causes acute neuronal damage, and calcium which causes delayed and more permanent damage. Third, pharmacologic blockade at the NMDA receptor-ion channel complex prevents ischemic neuronal damage. Studies using specific pharmacologic compounds that block glutamate's action hold particular promise for treating stroke in humans, including competitive antagonists at the NMDA glutamate binding site (for example, 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, AP5), noncompetitive antagonists at the calcium channel (for example, MK-801, dextromethorphan, ketamine), and agents that might be directed at the glycine, zinc, and magnesium sites.\r"

Low molecular weight (LMW) trypsin inhibitor also was analyzed in MEB washings. Chinchilla alpha 2-M showed a common antigenicity with human alpha 2-M. The mean value of alpha 1-AT in chinchilla plasma was 412.0 +/- 87.8 and that of alpha 2-M was 435.0 +/- 117.1 mg/dL. There was a significant relationship between alpha 1-AT level and antitryptic activity, and between alpha 2-M level and trypsin binding activity in plasma. The majority of alpha 1-AT and alpha 2-M in plasma is present as free inhibitors unsaturated with proteases. The MEB washings had significant antitryptic activity, which is attributed to both alpha 1-AT and LMW trypsin inhibitors. Inhibitory functions of alpha 1-AT and LMW trypsin inhibitors appear to play an important role in the defense of the normal middle ear mucosa.\r"

The animals were killed painlessly on days 1, 3, and 7 after inoculation, and the mucosal samples from two sites within the tympanic cavity, close to the tympanic orifice and distal to the orifice, were examined for ciliary activity and epithelial morphology. At day 1 and day 3 serous effusion was observed and deterioration of ciliary activity and morphologic changes were observed. No effusion was recognized at day 7, when the ciliary activity in the distal mucosa was still diminished and that in the proximal mucosa had recovered to a normal level. Our data have shown that lipopolysaccharide extracted from K pneumoniae can produce otitis media with effusion in laboratory animals, and dysfunction of cilia due to lipopolysaccharide probably is responsible for the accumulation of middle ear effusion. The mucociliary system is indeed an important defense system and failure of such a system, especially in the mucosa close to the tympanic orifice, can cause the buildup of effusions.\r"

Sixty patients with early HD were randomized to chronic baclofen, 60 mg/day, or placebo treatments and followed systematically for up to 42 months. Total functional capacity was not favorably influenced by baclofen treatment. Factors that contributed, although nonsignificantly, to a more rapid rate of total functional capacity decline included younger age (less than 35 years), earlier stage (stage I) of illness, paternal inheritance of the HD gene, and baclofen treatment. Our patients declined at a pace slower than that observed in other prospective studies, a finding likely due to selection criteria, avoidance of neuroleptic therapy, and strong psychosocial support.\r"

In the case of cancer, the study of viral oncogenic genes led to the recognition of similar human genes that play an important role in this disease. In an analogous fashion, the identification of viral genes important in central nervous system disease may lead to the recognition of related cellular genes that are important in nonviral central nervous system disease. New molecular techniques now provide tools for identification of pathogenic viral genes and elucidation of mechanisms of disease production. Positive-strand RNA viruses such as picornaviruses provide an especially attractive model system for studies of central nervous system disease-producing genes. A limitation in molecular studies of these viruses has resulted from an inability to use restriction enzymes, since these enzymes are active against DNA and not RNA. This limitation has recently been overcome with the preparation of infectious picornavirus complementary-DNA. This review highlights the importance of infectious complementary-DNA in pathogenesis studies and provides a glimpse of the impact of such studies on neurology.\r"

  ".U": "89271764\r", 
  ".W": "Two genetic loci selected for norfloxacin (nfxB) and ciprofloxacin (cfxB) resistance were characterized. Both mutations have previously been shown to confer pleiotropic resistance to quinolones, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline and to decrease expression of porin outer-membrane protein OmpF. nfxB was shown to map at about 19 min and thus to be genetically distinct from ompF (21 min), and cfxB was shown to be very closely linked to marA (34 min). cfxB was dominant over cfxB+ in merodiploids, in contrast to other quinolone resistance mutations. The two loci appear to interact functionally, because nfxB was not expressed in the presence of marA::Tn5. Both nfxB and cfxB decreased the expression of ompF up to 50-fold at the posttranscriptional level as determined in strains containing ompF-lacZ operon and protein fusions. Both mutations also decreased norfloxacin accumulation in intact cells. This decrease in accumulation was abolished by energy inhibitors and by removal of the outer membrane. These findings, in conjunction with those of Cohen et al. (S. P. Cohen, D. C. Hooper, J. S. Wolfson, K. S. Souza, L. M. McMurry, and S. B. Levy, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 32:1187-1191, 1988), suggest a model for quinolone resistance by decreased permeation in which decreased diffusion through porin channels in the outer membrane interacts with a saturable drug efflux system at the inner membrane.\r"

  ".W": "The disposition of amopyroquin was investigated in 10 healthy volunteers after a single 2-mg/kg (body weight) intramuscular dose of amopyroquin base. The major form of the drug in plasma and in whole blood was nonmetabolized amopyroquin, and only very low levels of its primary amine derivative were detected. After a rapid absorption phase (15 min), levels in plasma declined, following a tri-exponential model with a terminal elimination half-life of 129.6 +/- 92.5 h. The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) and the systemic clearance (CL/F) were 238 +/- 75 liters/kg and 2,063 +/- 1,159 ml/min, respectively. The renal clearance, calculated by using urine excreted during the first 48 h, was 119 +/- 99 ml/min and represented about 6% of the systemic clearance. About 1.2 and 0.2% of the amopyroquin dose was excreted in the urine during the first 48 h as nonmetabolized amopyroquin and its primary amine metabolite, respectively. Twenty-two Plasmodium falciparum malaria patients were studied after treatment with one of the following regimens of intramuscularly injected amopyroquin base: 3 mg/kg (body weight), 6 mg/kg, or 6 mg/kg followed by 3 mg/kg 24 h later. Parasitemia was cleared at day 7 in one of six, four of seven, and seven of nine patients, respectively. On the basis of this study, a regimen of 12 mg/kg (body weight) administered in two or three injections is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the anticellular effects of liposomal amphotericin B (AmB) formed from AmB and small unilamellar vesicles. The small unilamellar vesicles with or without cholesterol were prepared from three L-alpha-phosphatidylcholines with saturated acyl chains of different lengths: distearoyl (C18), dipalmitoyl (C16), and dimyristoyl (C14). We found that the anticellular potency of liposomal AmB, compared with that of free AmB, decreased with decreasing length of the acyl chain of the phospholipid and increased with the addition of cholesterol. In a parallel study (S. Jullien, A. Vertut-Croquin, J. Brajtburg, and J. Bolard, Anal. Biochem. 172:197-202, 1988), we found that binding of AmB to vesicles decreased with increasing length of the acyl chain of the phospholipid and decreased with the addition of cholesterol. We conclude that the anticellular effects of liposomal AmB preparations are due to the levels of AmB remaining free (unbound to the lipids) in these preparations.\r"

Amphotericin B concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and by bioassay, the latter being done on tissue homogenates as well as on tissue methanolic extracts. The fungistatic and fungicidal titers of the tissue homogenates were also tested against three strains of Candida albicans and one strain of Aspergillus fumigatus. Tissue concentrations of amphotericin B measured by HPLC varied with the tested tissues as well as with the total dose of amphotericin B-deoxycholate administered and ranged from 0.4 to 147.1 micrograms/g. A mean of 38.3% (range, 23.0 to 51.3%) of the total dose was recovered by HPLC from all of the tested organs. Bioassay of tissue methanolic extracts reached 58 to 81% of the concentration measured by HPLC, whereas only 15 to 41% was recovered from the homogenates. Overall, 27.5% of the total dose was recovered from the liver, 5.2% was recovered from the spleen, 3.2% was recovered from the lungs, and 1.5% was recovered from the kidneys. The median concentration in bile was 7.3 micrograms/ml, suggesting that biliary excretion could contribute to amphotericin B elimination to an estimated range of 0.8 to 14.6% of the daily dose. Fungicidal titers were seldom measured in tissues, but fungistatic titers were observed and were linearly correlated with amphotericin B concentration measured by HPLC. In conclusion, only a small proportion of the amphotericin B administered as amphotericin B-deoxycholate to patients seems diffusible and bioactive.\r"

Effects of the combination of the omp mutations and these beta-lactamases on the susceptibility of E. coli strains were studied with 15 beta-lactam antibiotics including cephalosporins, cephamycins, penicillins, imipenem, and aztreonam. The ompR1 mutant, MH1160, lacks OmpF and OmpC, and it showed reduced susceptibility to 11 of the 15 beta-lactam agents. The reduction in susceptibility to cefoxitin, moxalactam, and flomoxef was much greater than reduction in susceptibility to the other agents. When the ompR1 mutant produced the cephalosporinase of C. freundii, the susceptibility of the mutant to 12 of the 15 beta-lactam antibiotics decreased. The reduction in susceptibility of MH1160 to 10 of the 12 agents affected by the enzyme was two- to fourfold greater than that observed in MC4100. Such a synergistic effect was also observed with the cephalosporinase of P. vulgaris and ompR1 mutation against six cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aztreonam.\r"

Cefpirome was hydrolyzed by the enzyme more rapidly at Vmax than were cefotaxime and ceftazidime. However, the low affinity of the enzyme for cefpirome caused a reduction in the hydrolytic rate of cefpirome at a low drug concentration (0.1 microM). The high stability of cefpirome at a low concentration explains the high antimicrobial activity of the agent against cephalosporinase-producing bacteria.\r"

The protein was barely detectable in identically treated MVs-infected lysates, however. The recovery of all other measles virus proteins studied was the same in MVr- and MVs-infected cells at this anesthetic concentration. Thus, the altered expression of a single gene product appears to be responsible for the observed halothane resistance.\r"

USA 82:8771-8774, 1985), including cephalosporins (this study). To determine whether these effects are caused by a decreased uptake of the antibiotics, the permeation of several cephalosporins through the outer membrane was measured. For E. coli K-12 grown in LB broth containing 5 mM SAL or acetylsalicylate, permeation of the outer membrane by the five cephalosporins tested decreased three- to fivefold compared with that in cells not grown in salicylates. Permeation of the outer membrane by cephaloridine decreased within 15 min of the addition of SAL to cells grown in broth and reached a minimum in 1 to 2 h. When cells were transferred from broth with SAL to broth without SAL, their permeability to cephaloridine increased slowly for the first 45 min and more rapidly over the next 1.5 h; the permeability then attained normal levels by 3 h. The permeability changes that occurred after media shifts, either to or from SAL, were prevented by concentrations of chloramphenicol that inhibited protein synthesis. These effects of SAL on outer membrane permeability are fully consistent with their effects on antibiotic resistance and with the report (T. Sawai, S. Hirano, and A. Yamaguchi, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 40:233-237, 1987) that the outer membranes of SAL-treated cells are deficient in certain porins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Escherichia coli and Proteus species were both inhibited and killed at various microamperages and with several electrode types, the most efficient being gold-gold as the anode-cathode combination. Klebsiella pneumoniae in supplemented synthetic urine was least inhibited in growth, and higher microamperage (200 to 400 microA) was most effective in killing the bacteria. Bacterial growth reduction and killing were directly related to increasing microamperage and were inversely related to bacterial concentration.\r"

At 50 mg/kg, both zidovudine and ampicillin reduced the number of bacteria in the kidneys of mice and prevented lethal infection in mice with ascending pyelonephritis caused by E. coli. Zidovudine prevented a lethal S. dublin infection in calves over a wide dose range (8.0 to 31.0 mg/kg per day). Zidovudine levels in plasma of uninfected mice were 28.2 +/- 4.5 and 7.9 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml at 30 and 60 min, respectively, exceeding the MICs for the bacteria used in the infections. Few zidovudine-resistant strains were observed. The in vivo data raise the possibility that zidovudine may have an antibacterial effect in patients receiving this therapy.\r"

The use of two beta-lactam antibiotics rather than one does not appear to prolong neutropenia in patients undergoing treatment of hematological malignancy. However, in order to determine the effect of a single-beta-lactam combination, a similar carefully controlled prospective randomized study in which such treatment is compared with a non-beta-lactam-containing regimen is required.\r"

Significant nucleotide homology was noted in the region extending from the proposed -35 sequences through the first 59 base pairs of the aacC1 gene open reading frame (ORF) and the upstream flanking regions and ORFs of several other antibiotic resistance genes. Sequences were noted to be homologous with the 6'-N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase [AAC(6')-I], 2''-O-aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase [AAD(2'')], and 3''-O-aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase [AAD(3'')] resistance genes; the OXA-1, OXA-2, and PSE-2 beta-lactamase genes; and several dihydrofolate reductase genes. Small regions of homology were noted in the 3'-flanking regions of these resistance genes as well. A DNA probe for the aacC1 gene was selected from the nucleotide sequence information and was tested against a series of genetically and enzymatically defined strains. The probe, which proved specific for the aacC1 gene, was then tested against a series of 58 gentamicin-susceptible and 219 gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients at the Seattle Veterans Administration Medical Center. Only six clinical isolates were noted to carry the aacC1 gene. Each was resistant to gentamicin but susceptible to kanamycin, tobramycin, and amikacin. The presence of homologous regions of DNA at both the 3' and 5' ends of the aacC1 gene reinforces the importance of choosing probes from within the ORFs of genes and of avoiding flanking sequences. When the homology with other sequences extends into the ORF, as it does with the aacC1 gene, development of a specific probe may require determination of the nucleotide sequence.\r"

Combined data, including conventional cultures, DIF studies, and serologic findings, established that Streptococcus organisms, especially Streptococcus pyogenes (A), were, in nearly all cases, responsible for both erysipelas (26/27 cases) and acute cellulitis (11/15 cases) involving the lower limb in adults.\r"

  ".W": "IgG subclasses were determined in perilesional skin of 13 patients with pemphigus with active disease and of 14 patients in a state of clinical remission. Using indirect immunofluorescence technique, frozen sections were incubated with mouse monoclonal antihuman IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 followed by a second incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antimouse IgG. The results showed that among patients with active disease, IgG1 was found in all of them and IgG4 in 85%, while IgG2 and IgG3 were found in 54% and 77%, respectively. For patients in remission the most common subclass was IgG4 in 79% of patients, and in a decreased order IgG1, 50%; IgG3, 29%; and IgG2, 14%. It appears that IgG1 and IgG4 are predominant among patients with active lesions. IgG1 seems to be the most sensitive indicator for activity of the disease. IgG4, normally found in the lowest concentration in human serum, is the most common subclass in patients who are in remission. IgG3 and C3 may have a predictive value for remission.\r"

Genetic markers and by combining the major histocompatibility complex class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C), class II (HLA-DR), and class III (properdin factor B [BF] and C4) phenotyping with DNA level analysis of the C4 region. Of our patients, 54% had DR2 antigens and 50% had DR3 antigens, when the frequencies in the controls were 25% and 33%, respectively. The DR3 antigen was associated with annular skin lesions that were associated with a younger age at onset, whereas the DR2 antigen was associated with papulosquamous skin lesions and an older age at onset. The frequency of C4 null alleles was 83% in the patients and 50% in the controls. The null alleles were found in both C4A and C4B loci and were not associated with any special major histocompatibility complex haplotype. The DNA studies showed that the null phenotype mostly resulted from a gene deletion. A highly increased frequency of complement C4 null alleles may be a predisposing factor for cutaneous lupus erythematosus and especially of the subacute cutaneous type.\r"

Six patients with CSMH were observed, the largest series to date, and the literature was reviewed. Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma has presented as congenital patches or slightly indurated plaques with prominent overlying hair (88% of cases), or rarely as patches with perifollicular papules without prominent hair (12% of cases). Most lesions (61% of cases) have been somewhat hyperpigmented, but 39% of cases have been flesh colored. Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma has occurred on the torso and proximal extremities, except for one case on the eyebrow and eyelid (present study). A positive pseudo-Darier's sign (temporary induration or piloerection after rubbing) helped to differentiate CSMH from congenital hairy nevo-cellular nevus. Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma is a distinct entity that is at one end of a spectrum that includes Becker's nevus, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any congenital hairy lesion.\r"

A quota allocation system ensured comparability between the two treatment groups. The children were encouraged to use the alarm for four months. Both alarms were equally effective in helping children to become dry. There was no significant difference between the number of children unable to comply with treatment or to be helped by each alarm. The rate of acquisition of dryness was similar for the two groups. The traditional standard alarm was sturdier, more dependable, and easier to maintain, but the mini alarm had some advantages, particularly for girls. Both types of alarm are recommended for general use.\r"

Abdominal pain crises were significantly associated with gall stones but both factors appeared to reflect an increased clinical severity and were probably not causally related. No patients had symptoms specific of gall stones and an association with abdominal pain crisis should not, of itself, be considered an indication for surgery.\r"

Five hundred thirty-five patients were randomized prospectively to either NG decompression or no decompression. Stratification was by type of operation and patient age. Excluded were patients who had emergency surgery with peritonitis, extensive fibrous adhesions, enterotomies, previous pelvic irradiation, intra-abdominal infection, pancreatitis, chronic obstruction. prolonged operating times, or difficult endotracheal intubation. Two hundred seventy-four patients received NG decompression (Salem sump, Argyle Co., Division of Sherwood Medical, St. Louis, MO) and two hundred sixty-one did not. There were 33 protocol violations included in the 535 patients. Patients who were not decompressed experienced significantly more abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting than did those patients who were. Moreover, 13% required subsequent NG decompression as opposed to a reinsertion rate of 5% for patients routinely decompressed. The mean length of hospitalization for both groups was 11 days. There were no significant differences in nasopharyngeal or gastric bleeding, inability to cough effectively, respiratory infections, wound disruptions, reoperation, and wound infection rates (5%) between the two groups. We conclude that even though there is an increase in the rate of minor symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention, routine nasgastric decompression is not warranted after elective colon and rectal surgery.\r"

Tumor seeding along the catheter tract is an unusual complication but it occurred recently in one of our patients who had preoperative biliary drainage for four days. Four months after his pancreaticoduodenectomy, a 2-cm nodule developed at the catheter exit site. This nodule was a metastatic focus of adenocarcinoma similar to his pancreatic tumor. He died 1 month later and at autopsy was found to have numerous metastases along the catheter tract. A review of the world literature found 17 other patients with this complication. Thirteen of the 18 total patients had catheters placed for palliation, while 5 patients underwent preoperative drainage before definitive procedures, and 4 of these patients had undergone \"curative\" resections. Nine of the 18 patients had biliary obstruction from cholangiocarcinoma, while seven patients had primary pancreatic carcinoma. Positioning of the catheter tip above the obstructing tumor and maintaining the catheter for only a short duration before operation (mean 8 days for resected patients, range 2 to 16 days) did not protect against catheter-related tumor seeding. Patients with suspected malignant obstruction of the biliary tract who may have resectable tumors should not undergo routine preoperative biliary decompression. If, on exploration, the tumor is found to be unresectable, then a palliative bypass may be performed.\r"

The etiology was idiopathic in 4 patients, cardiomyopathy in 3, acute myocarditis in 1, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in 2, tumor in 1, postoperative Tetralogy of Fallot in 2, and acute bacterial endocarditis in 1. Pre- and/or intraoperative electrophysiologic mapping was achieved in 13 of 14 patients. A variety of operations were performed without death. Two late deaths have occurred, neither of them, however, from arrhythmias. After operation two patients had recurrent arrhythmias. Surgery for nonischemic ventricular tachycardia is safe and effective and should be considered early in the course of these mostly young patients.\r"

  ".W": "A multi-institutional study to evaluate the efficacy, clinical application, and safety of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) with the Dornier HM-3 or HM-4 lithotripter for bile duct calculi (BDC) was initiated in September, 1987. Symptomatic patients who entered into this prospective trial had BDC in the common bile duct and/or the intrahepatic, cystic or lobar ducts of the liver that were inaccessible or untreatable by papillotomy or percutaneous stone extraction. The study excluded gallbladder stones. Nasobiliary (54.4%) or transhepatic catheters (10.5%) and T-tube or cholecystostomy tubes (17.5%) or combinations (14.0%) permitted access for radiographic contrast to allow fluoroscopic monitoring of stone position and fragmentation. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, failure to localize the stone, disturbances of coagulation, pacemakers, or vascular aneurysms or large bones that lie in the focal axis of the shock waves. Eleven institutions treated 42 patients (23 male, 19 female) with BDC; age range was 25 to 95 years (mean +/- SD, 73.5 +/- 13.8) and ASA risk category was 1 to 4 (mean, 2.3 +/- 0.8). Fourteen patients (33.3%) had a single BDC; 28 had 2 to 8 stones (mean, 2.7 +/- 1.8) ranging in size from 6 mm to 30 mm (mean, 18.5 +/- 6.4). The majority (66.7%) of patients were postcholecystectomy. The 42 patients received 57 ESWL treatments consisting of 600 to 2400 shocks per treatment (mean, 1924 +/- 289) at 12 to 22 kV (mean, 18.5 +/- 1.9) administered over 20 to 125 minutes (mean, 52.9 +/- 20.8). General anesthesia was used in 32% of the treatments; the majority were treated with epidural or regional block (42.1%), local infiltration (28.1%), or intravenous sedation (38.6%). Fifteen patients (35.7%) required two ESWL treatments. Stone fragmentation occurred in 94.6% of evaluable patients and in 90.4% of ESWL treatments, respectively; however, BDC fragments remained in 59.5% of patients 24 hours after treatment (diameter less than or to 3 mm, 12%; 4 to 9 mm, 16%; greater than or equal to 10 mm, 68%). Some patients (50%) required adjunctive procedures to achieve stone removal that included endoscopic extraction (n = 10; 47.6%), biliary lavage (n = 8; 38.1%), endoscopic bile duct prosthesis (n = 1; 4.8%), and operation (n = 2; 9.5%). ESWL treatment complications during hospitalization were observed in 15 patients (35.7%) and were present in four (9.5%) at discharge. Complications included macrohematuria (5%), biliary pain (15%), biliary sepsis (5%), hemobilia (10%), ileus (2.5%), and adverse pulmonary changes (7.5%). One patient developed pancreatitis before ESWL at ERCP that resolved prior to discharge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Data from 95 heart transplantations performed at The Johns Hopkins Hospital from July 1983 to October 1988 were analyzed to detect patterns of morbidity and mortality. Using nonparametric techniques, hazard functions were determined for all deaths and for deaths due to infection or rejection. The rates of rejection and infection (episodes per patient-month) were determined within each of ten intervals following transplantation. A total of 19 deaths, 281 rejection episodes, and 180 distinct infections were available for analysis during a follow-up of 1 to 62 months. The hazard function for rejection appeared biphasic, with a rapidly decelerating early phase during the first year followed by a constant late phase. The hazard function for infection was triphasic, with a delayed, decelerating early phase, a period of increased risk approximately 2 years after operation, and finally a late constant phase. Both infection and rejection rates (episodes per patient-month) were biphasic, with rapidly decelerating early phases and constant late phases. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that eventually nonsurviving patients had significantly higher rates of rejection and infection during both the early and late phases compared with survivors. The increased rate of rejection among nonsurvivors was evident throughout follow-up, although no deaths were attributable directly to rejection after the first 8 months. These data suggest that a complex interrelationship between infection and rejection determines late survival after cardiac transplantation and that aggressive treatment of late rejection predisposes toward death from infection.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension after a cardiac operation is a frequent phenomenon. Complications resulting from this include bleeding, disruption of vascular suture lines, subendocardial ischemia, and possible cerebrovascular accidents. Treatment with sodium nitroprusside has become accepted practice to prevent these complications. To improve control of arterial blood pressure, a closed-loop system for sodium nitroprusside administration was developed. A prospective, randomized multicenter study was carried out postoperatively in 180 cardiac surgical patients to evaluate the performance of this system compared with manual control of infusion. Adherence of mean arterial blood pressure to +/- 10% of the target blood pressure occurred 85% of the time with the automatic system and 61% of the time with manual regulation (p less than 0.0001). With the automatic system, there was less hypertension (9% versus 22%; p less than 0.0001) and hypotension (6% versus 22%; p less than 0.0001). The superior control of hypertension was achieved more rapidly with less requirement for nurse regulation of infusion rate. The superior control of blood pressure resulted in less chest tube drainage in the automatic mode (720 mL versus 840 mL; p less than 0.05).\r"

  ".W": "Warm (30 degrees C) blood cardioplegia (K = 22 mEq/L) with glutamate (26 mmol/L) as a reperfusate was compared with unmodified blood reperfusion after prolonged hypothermic storage of the isolated canine heart. After cardioplegic arrest, three groups of hearts (n = 5 each) were excised and stored at 2 degrees C. In groups 1 and 2, reperfusion with unmodified blood was undertaken after six and 24 hours of storage, respectively, and in group 3, reperfusion with modified warm blood cardioplegia containing glutamate was administered after 24 hours of storage. After reperfusion, no significant difference in left ventricular developed pressure was noted between groups 1 (110 +/- 15 mm Hg), 2 (127 +/- 14 mm Hg), and 3 (98 +/- 13 mm Hg). Similarly, no difference in maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure was noted between groups 1 (1,456 +/- 171 mm Hg/s), 2 (1,905 +/- 395 mm Hg/s), and 3 (1,450 +/- 291 mm Hg/s). Group 3 (modified reperfusate) had improved diastolic compliance compared with group 2 (0.776 mm Hg/mL versus 1.395 mm Hg/mL; p less than 0.02). We conclude that our modified reperfusate improves diastolic function after 24 hours of hypothermic storage, but does not result in improved systolic function.\r"

  ".W": "The current safety of operations on the heart requiring cardiopulmonary bypass occurred because of a series of step-by-step laboratory and clinical investigations that were compromises between the time needed for heart repair and the brain's requirement for oxygen. The first step, so clearly shown in a paper by Bigelow and associates in 1950, was the reduction of the brain's need for oxygen by surface cooling to 28 degrees to 32 degrees C, limited to this level by cardiac and pulmonary failure at levels lower than this. The six to eight minutes of circulatory arrest permitted time for repair of simple defects. This method was rapidly adopted by many surgeons. As low-flow pump oxygenators became available, blood cooling to 10 degrees to 20 degrees C was introduced. This increased the periods of circulatory arrest to 30 to 60 minutes, and also made still longer periods of bypass with the pump oxygenator possible. Hypothermia to reduce oxygen and metabolic requirements is still an important adjunct to bypass, even with the currently used efficient pump oxygenators. It remains the most important component of myocardial preservation, and has made possible the delay needed for transportation between the harvesting and the transplantation of organs.\r"

Chronic dialysis patients are more prone to staphylococcal infections because of their decreased immunity, increased skin colonization by staphylococci, and the multiple needle punctures required for dialysis. The source of the staphylococci is the anterior nares. Elimination of staphylococcal nasal carriage results in a significantly lower infection rate. Selected clinical studies of topical and oral therapy for eradication of staphylococcal nasal carriage are reviewed. Rifampin has been the most consistently efficacious agent, although emergence of resistance is a potential problem. Trials utilizing newer topical and oral agents for prophylactic eradication of S aureus from the nose are indicated. Promising antibiotics include topical mupirocin, the oral quinolones, and clindamycin.\r"

The ratio of the concentration in serum or bile over the minimum inhibitory concentration against aerobic gram-negative bacilli (therapeutic index) was higher for mezlocillin than for either ampicillin or gentamicin. Twenty (83%) of 24 patients were cured following mezlocillin therapy compared with 9 (41%) of 22 patients after ampicillin-gentamicin therapy. The 3 patients with superinfection were in the ampicillin-gentamicin arm of the study. Fewer toxic or adverse effects occurred in association with mezlocillin treatment than with ampicillin-gentamicin treatment. Mezlocillin therapy was more effective, less toxic, and less expensive than treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin for patients with cholangitis.\r"

Eight patients had a platelet count of 100 to 140 X 10(9)/L on one occasion, with a count of greater than 140 x 10(9)/L on the subsequent measurement. The mean (+/- SD) values of the initial and lowest platelet counts during therapy in all patients were 288 +/- 100 x 10(9)/L and 253 +/- 88 x 10(9)/L, respectively, with the lowest counts occurring on day 4.1 +/- 4.2. A least-squares line was computed for each patient to fit the day and counts; the slopes were significantly different from zero and negative in 7.8% of patients and positive in 14.5%.

However, despite intensive education and counseling regarding HIV transmission and prevention of transmission, including safe sex practices and pregnancy prevention, fewer than half of the couples in which one member is a hemophiliac practice these preventive measures consistently. Because heterosexual HIV transmission is preventable, this poor compliance is puzzling. The implementation of safe sex practices may increase the HIV-associated stress that is experienced by these couples, and the female partner may not necessarily be well informed, fearing testing and confidentiality issues in her own community. By providing education and counseling for female partners of hemophiliacs about their HIV-associated risk or by seeking alternative resources to help accomplish this task, hemophilia care providers will be fulfilling their ethical and moral obligations to these women.\r"

Physostigmine promptly increased plasma arginine vasopressin (tenfold), beta-endorphin (twofold to threefold) and epinephrine (threefold) levels in elderly control subjects. In contrast, patients with AD showed attenuated responses to physostigmine. When controls and patients with AD who experienced nausea (n = 2 and n = 6, respectively) were excluded, the arginine vasopressin, beta-endorphin, and epinephrine responses of patients with AD were significantly less than those of control subjects. These data suggest that the central nervous system cholinergic deterioration of AD results in decreased responsiveness of neuroendocrine systems that are regulated by central cholinergic mechanisms.\r"

This expression pattern suggests some oncogenes may have tissue type specificity. Some oncogenes may also be expressed in only a fraction of the malignant cells, such as the proliferating cells. Flow cytometry has only recently been applied to the simultaneous measurement of oncoprotein levels and DNA content of malignant cells. As this application is developed, our understanding of oncogene expression in malignancy will be enhanced and its diagnostic importance will be realized.\r"

Similar approaches to the analysis and sorting of cell markers by immunofluorescence have been automated for a decade using flow cytometry. Automation of both procedural and interpretative aspects of immunohistology has been the focus of greater commercial and professional attention in recent years. Automated immunostaining is accorded several advantages, including cost savings, uniformity of slide preparation, and reduction of procedural human errors. Automated interpretation may not be necessary or desirable for all types of preparations, but it is logical for quantitation of estrogen and progesterone receptors, infiltrating immunoregulatory populations in tumors, and many other applications.\r"

This review focuses on preanalytic and analytic factors that affect the results of flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with fluorescent antibody or dyes specific for nucleic acid. The article reviews the controls used to assess instrument performance followed by a discussion of biological variables, and reagent, methodological, and instrumental factors that may affect the interpretation of these results.\r"

Specimens consisting of fresh human lymphocytes isolated from blood or tissue or neoplastic cells grown in culture were mailed to participants by overnight mail. Results of analyses for cell surface antigens on lymphocytes and for cellular DNA content were reported to the College of American Pathologists Computer Center and the summary data were mailed to participants. The results obtained to date indicate no reagent- or instrument-related biases for measurements of cell surface antigens or for cellular DNA content. Interlaboratory variability in enumerating lymphocytes of a given subset varies inversely with the percentage of such cells in each specimen. In our experience, it is feasible and practical to conduct an interlaboratory proficiency survey in clinical flow cytometry.\r"

We found ELIs in 166 (14.4%) of 1152 biopsy specimens from cyclosporine-treated patients with cardiac transplants, with 78.6% of those patients having at least one ELI. The ELIs ranged in size from 0.007 to 1.89 mm2 and were predominantly T-lymphocyte infiltrates with foci of polyclonal B lymphocytes (follicular center type). Macrophages and plasma cells were located at the interface between the ELI and myocardium. The infiltrate extended into the myocardium in approximately 50% of cases and was associated with severe, local myocyte injury. The morphologic and immunohistochemical appearance was distinct from that of acute rejection and consistent with an early lymphoproliferative lesion of the type associated with Epstein-Barr virus and cyclosporine therapy.\r"

The titanium filter is slightly larger than the standard stainless steel filter and can be loaded into a 12 F diameter carrier system as opposed to the 24 F stainless steel filter. In patients ranging from 17 to 94 years of age, percutaneous insertions were made from the right femoral vein in 24 patients, the left femoral vein in 11 patients, and the right internal jugular in 2 patients. Operative access was obtained in 1 patient each from the right femoral, right jugular, and a lumbar vein at laparotomy. Insertion was completed in all cases but 1 and only 1 patient (3%) showed postoperative femoral vein thrombosis. Distal filter migration was seen in 3 cases (7.5%) without sequelae, and there was no proximal migration. The titanium Greenfield vena caval filter provides improved ease of insertion, and the sheath technique should prevent misplacement. Distal migration should be preventable by techniques to promote hook engagement at the time of insertion.\r"

Commentary is made about the diverging results from earlier studies on antimicrobial prophylaxis and on the multifactorial causality of surgical infection. We believe that variables such as physical condition of the patients, virulence and local resistance patterns of bacteria, and technical skill of the surgeons are far more important in regard to the postoperative outcome concerning septic complications than is the choice of proper antibiotics. Thus, to determine the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis, we call for larger investigations in the future, preferably double-blind, where it is possible to better control and diminish the influence of determinants other than the antibiotics being compared.\r"

Wound healing was assessed by measuring the resistance of the closed wound to leak or burst with controlled infusion of fluid. Bursting strength measurements of these incisions were compared with those undertaken in age-weight matched controls without wounds to determine the rate of gain of wound strength. The bursting strength measurements of unwounded tissue was found to vary according to the age, weight, and specific tissue. As the animals gained weight over 42 days, the bursting strength of their colons and musculoaponeurotic tissues significantly increased. In general, the regain of prewounding bursting strength was inversely proportional to the bursting strength of the unwounded tissue. The bursting strength of abdominal musculoaponeurotic tissue was the highest, followed by the stomach and then the colon. The time intervals in which the wounded musculoaponeurotic tissues, gastrotomies, and colonic anastomoses regained the strength of the unwounded tissue was 42, 14, and 7 days, respectively. The performance of Maxon and PDS sutures in the musculoaponeurotic tissues, gastrotomies, and colonic anastomoses was similar.\r"

This study evaluated (1) the contribution of blood to the increased glucose utilization noted following endotoxemia, (2) the direct action of endotoxin on skeletal muscle glucose uptake in an isolated hindlimb perfusion system and in incubated muscle, and (3) the possibility that the increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle mediated by endotoxin requires the presence of plasma. Incubation of blood with 50 and 100 mg/L of endotoxin increased glucose uptake and lactate production in a dose-dependent manner. Muscle incubations and perfusions in the absence of plasma and white blood cells showed that glucose uptake and lactate production were not affected by the presence of 50 to 250 mg/L of endotoxin, while 500 mg/L of endotoxin produced a 26.2% decrease in glucose uptake. In contrast, incubation of muscle in the presence of plasma and endotoxin increased glucose uptake by 37%. These findings suggest that (1) the increased glucose utilization of endotoxemia is only partially explained by increased glucose metabolism by blood, (2) endotoxin does not have a direct effect on the glucose uptake of skeletal muscle, and (3) an interaction of endotoxin with a component of plasma is required for an endotoxin-mediated increase in glucose utilization by skeletal muscle.\r"

An intense systolic low-frequency Doppler signal of alternating flow direction accessible in the neck, either along the extent of a luminal tapering stenosis or proximal to a severe obstruction at the skullbase, indicated this diagnosis. Resolution or decreasing stenosis may similarly be diagnosed noninvasively, as shown by results from subsequent arteriograms in 14 patients (64%). This occurred suddenly during sequential follow-up between 2 days and 30 weeks (mean, 6 weeks) after the diagnosis was made.\r"

The patient declined treatment with ganciclovir but elected to be treated with zidovudine. Two months later his CMV retinitis regressed, and it remained inactive for a total of 9 months. The most likely explanation was zidovudine-mediated improvement in the patient's immune function with subsequent suppression of the CMV retinitis in the left eye. The patient ultimately and preterminally had CMV retinitis develop in his right eye. He subsequently died and his eyes were examined at autopsy. Active CMV retinitis lesions were noted in the right eye while inactive scars were noted in the left eye. Immunoperoxidase staining and in situ hybridization studies demonstrated the presence of CMV in the right eye but not in the left eye. While ganciclovir remains the treatment of choice for CMV retinitis, zidovudine treatment may have a beneficial effect on CMV retinitis in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of short segment stimulation (SSS) of the peroneal nerve at the knee in order to localize the site of compression and/or entrapment of the nerve. Eighteen patients with suspected peroneal nerve palsy and 28 controls were studied by SSS of the peroneal nerve across the knee. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were obtained from the extensor digitorum brevis muscle after successive supramaximal stimuli of the nerve at 2 cm intervals, starting 4 cm distal (D4 and D2) and ending 6 cm proximal (P2, P4, and P6) to the fibular head prominence (P). In patients the average conduction times from D2 to P, P to P2, and P2 to P4 were significantly (P less than 0.05) longer and the average amplitude of CMAPs at P, P2, P4, and P6 significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than those of controls. Fourteen patients showed statistically significant reduction in amplitude and prolongation of conduction time in one or more short segments. Three patients had prolongation of conduction time only and one patient had reduction in amplitude only. When nerve conduction of the entire 10-cm segment across the knee was tested by the conventional method, only nine showed reduction in amplitude from proximal stimulation, or slowing of motor conduction velocity across the 10-cm segment or both. It was concluded that the SSS technique is a sensitive and reliable procedure for the detection of mild compression or entrapment of the peroneal nerve around the knee.\r"

Existing aids for standing and walking and those aids under development in research laboratories are discussed. One conclusion is that therapeutic and perhaps functional standing could be achieved in a greater number of individuals using existing technology; however it must also be realized that some barriers still exist which prevent various technologies from being more widely used. Studies which measure the benefits of standing, and more fully establish minimum standing times to achieve these benefits, are needed. Standing is a necessary component of many tasks, and it is unlikely single type of standing aid is likely to perform adequately in every situation that requires standing. Therefore it may be prudent to have a variety of standing aids available to patients.\r"

A pUC plasmid containing an HIV insert starting at the 5' end of the pol gene and ending just inside the intergrase coding sequence was expressed in E. coli. It provided an 11 kD gene product (protease) that specifically cleaved the Gazdar MuLV Pr65gag precursor into Pr40gag (p30 + p10) and Pr27gag (p15 + p12) intermediates, as well as lower molecular weight gag-encoded products. These were detected by immunoblotting with either MuLV anti-p30 or p12 sera. Using cleavage of MuLV Pr65gag as an assay system, pepstatin A, fusidic acid, and cerulenin were observed to inhibit HIV protease cleavage by greater than 50% at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2-0.5, and 0.5 mM, respectively.\r"

A bolus injection of glucose was given to elevate blood sugar, followed by infusion of D20%. Blood sugar was maintained at 250 mg/dl by checking at 10 minute intervals and adjusting the IV infusion. Dialysate with regular insulin was instilled after blood sugar was constant for 20 minutes. The end-point was the amount of glucose to maintain a blood sugar of 250 mg/dl after instillation of dialysate and regular insulin. Mean blood sugars were similar within and between each dose group. The effect of regular insulin was noted within 10 minutes. The amount of glucose used with the IV dose differed from all other (p less than 0.05). The amount used by the 5 and 10 U doses of i.p. insulin were similar. Increasing amounts of glucose are required to maintain the blood sugar at increasing doses of intraperitoneal regular insulin up to 5 U. Thus, there appears to be a dose response curve for i.p. insulin.\r"

Catheter removal is rarely needed to resolve the episodes unless they are complicated by endogenous sources such as perforated diverticulitis or infections of the extraperitoneal catheter section. Recurrent peritonitis with the same organism has been attributed to bacterial colonization of the intraperitoneal section, making the decision for catheter removal more difficult. Catheter removal with substitution of hemodialysis may have greater morbidity than prolonged antibiotics. The authors retrospectively analyzed our incidence of and reasons for catheter removal during therapy for bacterial peritonitis for the period from October 1, 1980, to December 31, 1986. For uncomplicated peritonitis, that is, in the absence of infection of the extraperitoneal catheter section, endogenous sources, and episodes associated with catheter function problems per se, the authors were able to resolve the peritonitis without catheter removal in 99.2% of cases. It was concluded that the intraperitoneal catheter section plays a negligible role in thwarting therapeutic efforts in uncomplicated bacterial peritonitis of CAPD.\r"

Both single-rate and programmable insulin pumps are now being evaluated in human trials with generally favorable results. Current clinical trial results indicate that the problem of insulin aggregation in pumps that inhibited initiation and expansion of clinical trials for several years has now been largely solved. Patients with implantable pumps are generally well-satisfied with this form of therapy, would choose it again, and recommend it to friends and relatives. Though currently more costly than subcutaneous insulin injections, the convenience of implantable pump therapy and the potential for reduction of diabetic complications through improved metabolic control may make it the treatment of choice in the future.\r"

The early circulatory events are increased resistance to sinusoidal blood flow and shift of arterial blood into a splanchnic venous pool with reduction of effective (arterial) intravascular volume (EIVV). The latter stimulates neurohormonal sodium and water retention by the kidney, restoring normal EIVV and expanding total intravascular volume (TIVV). After repeated cycles, normal splanchnic compliance is exceeded and sinusoidal and splanchnic capillary hypertension develop. Hepatic and splanchnic lymph production increases; when these rates exceed the absorptive capacities of the hepatic and retroperitoneal lymphatics and those of the peritoneal cavity, ascites develops. The ascites may, if untreated, be progressive and the start of a vicious circle in which sodium and water are increasingly retained.\r"

  ".W": "The peritoneovenous shunt (PVS) is a safe procedure; all of its complications have been found to be preventable. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) can be a life threatening complication but has been completely eliminated by draining the ascitic fluid at the time of surgery, as it is caused by the introduction of excessive quantities of peritoneal fluid into the venous system. Peritoneal fluid is rich in tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), which is inhibited by epsilon aminocaproic acid. This substance has been successfully used to treat postshunt coagulopathy. The salt retention associated with ascites is related to a diminished plasma volume, a condition further aggravated by diuretic drugs. A PVS should be inserted if the patient does not respond to a salt restricted diet. Occult peritonitis occurs in 10% of cirrhotic ascites. The shunt does not prevent this, and a high percentage of late shunt failures are caused by fibrinopurulent debris in the valve. The valve system should not contain a pump, which disseminates infection and causes fatal emboli; pumping and flushing are seldom remedial and often dangerous. Because the complications of the shunt are all preventable, the indications for the shunt should be liberalized.\r"

The presence of DNA-ploidy as detected using this technique is a feature of malignant and pre-malignant disease. In this reported single case, DNA-ploidy was present but the clinical features of this patient were atypical for LCH. We have performed a FCM study of the DNA of nine biopsies of LCH lesions from six patients with well-established disease. In addition, in one of these, fresh tissue studies including the use of an anti-CD I monoclonal antibody to specifically label the LCH cells were performed. In all cases the DNA content of the cells was entirely normal. We therefore found no evidence that LCH is a neoplastic disorder.\r"

Two millimetre punch and split thickness of grafts were obtained from involved and uninvolved areas from each patient and grafted onto nude mice. Biopsies were taken from the grafts at 14 and 21 days after transplantation for histological and immunofluorescence studies and after 6 weeks for Dopa incubation for melanocyte populations. A complete disappearance of the pathological changes of LP was found 21 days following grafting. An increased number of melanocytes was noted. This indicates that the pathogenesis of LP may not be due to an inherent change in the epidermal cells, but rather to the migration of cellular elements of the immune system.\r"

The cumulative prevalence of dysplastic cutaneous lesions in 64 patients who had received cyclosporine for between 24 and 72 months was compared with 33 renal transplant patients who had been treated with azathioprine over a similar period of time. The overall prevalence of cutaneous dysplasia was 22% in the cyclosporine group and 9% in the azathioprine group. The cumulative prevalence of cutaneous dysplasia in the cyclosporine group was greater at all time points studied.

At the narrow opening there are three slip-knots by which the net is pulled forward and out of the orbit. Then the optic nerve is exposed and the surgeon is able to cut it close to the apex of the orbit. The length of severed optic nerve amounts as a rule to about 15 mm or more, depending on the age of patient.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six patients with progressive Hodgkin's disease after conventional chemotherapy received intensive chemoradiotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT); 19 also received additional involved-field radiotherapy. Twenty-one patients [81%, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 61% to 94%] attained complete (n = 18) or partial responses. Ten patients (38%, 95% CI 20% to 59%) are disease-free a median of 4.5 years later (range 3.5 to 7.0 years), including seven patients with continuous complete responses. The likelihood of overall response was not significantly influenced by any clinical or treatment variable examined. However, there was a trend favoring patients with higher Karnofsky scores, and higher scores were associated with attainment of complete responses (P = .06 and P = .02, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). Both higher Karnofsky scores and shorter durations of disease before transplantation were associated with improved survival in a stepwise Cox multivariate analysis. The chief cause of failure was progression at sites previously involved with Hodgkin's disease. No patient relapsed in the marrow, and two of three patients with a history of marrow involvement with Hodgkin's disease achieved durable complete responses after transplantation. These data suggest that inadequate pretransplant conditioning, and not the reinoculation of occult tumor cells in the autologous marrow, caused most relapses. Fatal treatment-related toxicity occurred in six patients. Three patients died of idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis; each had previously received local mediastinal irradiation before intensive chemoradiotherapy. Intensive chemoradiotherapy and ABMT produces durable responses in some patients with Hodgkin's disease incurable with conventional therapy. Use of such therapies at the first sign of failure with conventional chemotherapy and development of more effective conditioning regimens should further improve results.\r"

In addition, these agents can significantly prolong survival if administered following lethal doses of irradiation or CTX. To induce protective activity, cytokines were injected 20 hours before lethal irradiation or CTX administration. To accelerate recovery from lethal irradiation, the cytokines must be administered shortly following irradiation, and the induction of maximal levels of activity is dependent on chronic administration. In contrast, because of their longer half-lives, accelerated recovery from alkylating agents requires a delay of at least 24 to 48 hours to allow complete clearance of CTX before administration of a CSF. Studies quantitating peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow cellularity as well as colony-forming units per culture (CFU-C) frequency and CFU-C per femur revealed a significant correlation between these parameters and the ability to survive lethal irradiation. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.\r"

  ".U": "89274392\r", 
  ".W": "Factor X Friuli was isolated from plasma by immunoaffinity and ion exchange chromatography and compared with normal factor X purified by the same method. Similar molecular weights were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the intact or activated factor X molecules including their respective heavy and light chains. These data indicated that there were no gross structural differences between the normal and variant proteins. Immunochemical assays employing either polyclonal or 46 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) did not reveal any structural deviations. Two-dimensional peptide maps indicated that while the light chains of normal and Friuli factor X were very similar, the heavy chains of the native and activated molecules contained a limited number of differences. These data suggested that the defect in factor X Friuli may be a point mutation which lies within the activated heavy chain defined by the 195-424 amino acid sequence. Activation of factor X Friuli in purified systems showed that Russell's viper venom cleaved the molecule at 70% of the normal rate, while the rate of proteolysis of the variant protein was reduced 98% and 75% when incubated with the extrinsic and intrinsic activation complexes, respectively. These data support the clinical laboratory findings and the hypothesis that the defect associated with the Friuli variant may reflect an abnormal interaction between factor X Friuli and the nonproteolytic cofactors of the extrinsic and intrinsic factor X activation complexes. Fluorescence polarization studies suggested that a bound dansylated inhibitor of factor Xa was not oriented to the same extent within the active site of the variant enzyme relative to normal factor Xa until the addition of phospholipid and factor Va. Activated factor X Friuli generated thrombin from prothrombin in a purified system, but at one third the normal rate that was attributed to the Kcat suggesting a secondary effect of this defect.\r"

In 25 patients (74%), a transient IgE peak (two- to 2,750-fold increase) appeared in the serum 3 to 4 weeks after BMT. In 18 patients (51%), a two- to 125-fold increase in sCD23 coincided with the IgE peak. In only three patients was a sCD23 peak observed without a concomitant increase in IgE. The sCD23 increment preceded the IgE peak in each individual case. During the period of increased sCD23 serum levels, the absolute numbers of circulating B cells and other cell types expressing surface CD23 were extremely low. The biologic significance of these findings is discussed in light of present knowledge of regulation of B-cell growth and differentiation with special reference to the role of sCD23 as a multifunctional cytokine.\r"

The cellular roles in the tissue factor response have been previously elucidated, and we now report those roles in PAI-2 production. Monocytes are the only cells among LPS-stimulated PBMs that produce PAI-2 as assessed by measurement of PAI-2 activity and antigen. Concomitant immunohistochemistry demonstrated that monocytes contain PAI-2, with a greater number staining positively and more intensely after exposure to LPS. LPS-stimulated monocytes produced increased amounts of PAI-2 with or without addition of lymphocytes. Lymphocytes prestimulated with LPS and then washed did not induce PAI-2 production in monocytes to which they were added. Lipid X, a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway of lipid A and LPS, was able to inhibit LPS induction of monocyte PAI-2 in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was not due to cellular toxicity, the phospholipidlike nature of lipid X, interference with the PAI-2 assay, or monocyte production of a substance interfering with PAI-2. Lipid X was an effective inhibitor of PAI-2 production even when added up to 30 minutes after LPS.\r"

Antibody S.5 rapidly localized to marrow and spleen, achieving tissue/blood ratios greater than 6:1 within three hours of injection that were maintained for at least 48 hours. Prior treatment with cyclophosphamide (CY) markedly altered the distribution of S.5 but had much less effect on the distribution of 7.2 and almost no effect on the distribution of a control antibody. When animals were treated with increasing doses of 131I labeled to S.5, lethal myelosuppression occurred when a dose of 6 mCi/kg was reached. At this dose, the otherwise lethal effects of 131I could be reversed with autologous marrow transplant support.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-nine patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) received HLA-identical bone marrow transplants (BMTs) from sibling donors after preparation with high doses of busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Forty-nine patients were transplanted in first complete remission (CR), and 50 patients were transplanted in second and third CR and early relapse. Fifty-three received one of three regimens containing primarily low-dose cyclophosphamide (group I) for graft-v-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis; since March 1983, 46 patients received intravenous (IV) cyclosporine (group II). After December 1983, only cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative blood products were used in appropriate patients, and since April 1984 patients seropositive for herpes-simplex virus (HSV) and CMV received high-dose acyclovir prophylaxis. For patients transplanted in first CR, there was a significantly lower incidence of acute GVHD (P = .005) and deaths related to GVHD and interstitial pneumonitis (P = .001) in patients in group II. This was reflected in an improved Kaplan-Meier probability of disease-free survival (DFS) in the 22 patients transplanted in group II as compared with the 27 patients in group I (64% +/- 10% v 30% +/- 9%, P = .017). The probability of remaining in remission was slightly lower in group II (82% +/- 9% v 94% +/- 6%, P = .479). For patients transplanted in second and third CR and early relapse, the incidence of acute GVHD (P = .026) and deaths related to GVHD and interstitial pneumonitis was significantly lower in group II (P = .029); the probability of remaining in remission was also less (47% +/- 15% v 91% +/- 15%, P = .022). However, the probability of DFS was not significantly different between the two groups (26% +/- 10% v 35% +/- 18%, P = .957). We conclude that transplantation for patients in first CR who received IV cyclosporine therapy is effective treatment; patients with more refractory disease treated with the same cyclosporine regimen (group II) had a lower incidence of GVHD than those treated in group I, but survival did not improve because of an increase in the number of relapses and other nonleukemic complications.\r"

On both occasions cross-sectional correlations were strongest between the health status measures (HAQ and FLP) and grip strength and the Ritchie articular index. The sensitivity and specificity of the two health status measures in relation to clinical change were calculated and overall the HAQ and FLP achieved similarly modest levels of sensitivity and specificity. The greater amount of precision and information provided by the FLP has to be weighed against the simpler measurement assumptions and shorter time required to administer the HAQ.\r"

We will need to know what types of antigen trigger aberrant responses in those that are susceptible, and whether continuous presence of antigen is necessary to sustain chronic inflammation. The second part of this article will review immunological injury to joint tissues as an off-shoot of the CMI and HI responses of RA. Using data from animal models we shall examine criteria for establishing chronic joint inflammation, and consider their relevance to RA. We shall also consider the problem of why some joints are more susceptible than others to immunological injury.\r"

Evaluation with respect to clinical signs of infection was done immediately after the treatment and 4 weeks later. In addition, a urine culture was performed 2 weeks after ESWL, i.e. 1 week after completing treatment with antibiotics and methenamine hippurate. With respect to infectious complications there were no differences between Groups A and C, between Groups B and C or between Group A and B+C, whereas an unexplained slightly higher infectious rate was recorded for Group B compared with Group A. In all patients the occurrence of bacteriuria was low (6.7%) despite the fact that almost 30% of patients had a ureteric catheter during the ESWL procedure. Patients with ureteric catheters did not present with more infectious complications than those without. All patients had a bladder catheter during ESWL. It was concluded that prophylactic treatment with antibiotics during ESWL treatment is unnecessary in all situations where an infectious aetiology is unlikely.\r"

In this study of 15 patients with bladder cancer, a new method using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a newly developed double-surface coil was tested for bladder cancer staging and compared with other existing techniques. Ultrasonography produced 2 cases of overstaging and 2 of understaging. This was due to the inability of this method to evaluate muscular infiltration accurately. All superficial bladder tumours were staged correctly with ultrasound with the exception of 1 case that was overstaged because of superficial tumour calcification. Double-surface coil MRI correctly staged all infiltrating tumours. Two small superficial tumours were missed by MRI, while another superficial tumour was overstaged. It is suggested that double-surface coil MRI and intravesical ultrasonography are good complementary examinations in the pre-operative staging of bladder tumours. Larger studies are necessary to prove the reliability of this conclusion.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical efficacy of high dose (160 mg) polyoestradiol phosphate (PEP) was compared with that of orchiectomy in a prospective randomised multicentre study including 200 prostatic cancer patients. The effect of daily low dose (75 mg) acetosalicylic acid (ASA) on possible cardiovascular complications during the first 6 months of therapy was also evaluated. Oestrogen-treated patients had more progressions, but follow-up was too short to draw any definite conclusions on the efficacy of treatment. There was no cardiovascular mortality and there were no thromboembolic complications in any treatment group. It was concluded that parenteral high dose PEP is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and there is no need for daily low dose ASA.\r"

A clinical response was not obtained until Nocardia asteroides was correctly identified as the causal agent. The response to 30% sulfacetamide was dramatic. We review the clinical presentation of Nocardia keratitis and recommendations for management. Use of corticosteroids should be avoided in Nocardia keratitis. This opportunistic organism should be considered in patients who wear contact lenses in whom infectious keratitis develops.\r"
