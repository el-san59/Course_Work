  ".W": "We have previously shown that the timing of surgical removal of an estrogen-receptor-bearing mammary adenocarcinoma within the estrous cycle of the female C3HeB/FeJ mouse profoundly influences the frequency of subsequent tumor cell metastasis. In order to investigate the role of the immune response in this phenomenon, we measured splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in 80 female cycling mice, 16 to 18 weeks old, assigned to one of four estrous stages as determined by relative quantity of vaginal cellularity; proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. After prolonged synchronization on 12-hours-on, 12-hours-off light-dark circadian schedules, daily vaginal smears were obtained for 2 weeks to characterize estrous cycling. On the day the animals were killed, vaginal smears were performed and single-cell suspensions were prepared from the harvested spleens. Direct cytotoxicity of spleen cells against the YAC tumor target was assessed immediately in a 3 1/2 hour 51Cr release assay and expressed as NK activity in lytic units (LU 20%). IL-2 production was determined in a bioassay with the IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cell line. Significant differences in NK activity among estrous stages mimicking the variation found in frequency of surgical cure from mammary adenocarcinoma were observed (p = 0.035; one-way analysis of variance), with the time of lowest metastatic potential corresponding precisely with the time of highest splenocyte NK activity. These both occurred during the proestrus and estrus stages, characterized by high fertility, ovulation, and peak FSH, LH, and estrogen concentrations. In addition, NK activity was found to correlate significantly with IL-2 production (r = 0.4, p less than 0.0005). These results indicate that important components of the cellular immune response to cancer vary rhythmically with hormonal changes in the host and may represent one of the factors affecting the delicate balance between host and tumor that alters the frequency of postsurgical metastatic dissemination.\r"

  ".W": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a 37-amino acid peptide, is widely distributed in the gastrointestinal tract where it is colocalized with substance P. The effect of CGRP on gallbladder motility is unknown. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of CGRP on cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8) and substance P-stimulated gallbladder contraction in vivo and in vitro. In in vivo studies intragallbladder pressure was measured in response to bolus administration of CCK-8 (10(-15) to 10(-9) mol/kg) or substance P (10(-12) to 10(-7) mol/kg), either alone or with a continuous infusion of CGRP (10(-9) mol/kg/hr), in anesthetized guinea pigs. In in vitro studies the contractile force of guinea pig gallbladder muscle strips was examined in response to CCK-8 (10(-12) to 10(-7) mol/L) and substance P (10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L), alone or with CGRP (10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L). CGRP (10(-9) mol/kg/hr) inhibited in vivo gallbladder contraction that was stimulated by CCK-8, but not by substance P. CGRP alone produced a significant (p less than 0.05) dose-related decrease in the resting tension of gallbladder strips in vitro. CGRP (10(-6) mol/L) inhibited gallbladder muscle tension in vitro, stimulated by both CCK-8 and substance P. These studies show that CGRP can affect gallbladder motor activity by decreasing smooth muscle tone and that CGRP can antagonize the action of CCK and substance P. CGRP may be involved in the physiologic control of gallbladder emptying and refilling.\r"

Clinical variables included age, sex, New York Heart Association (NYHA) anginal class, presence of unstable angina, and surgical class. The angiographic variables included percentage of left main stenosis, presence of right coronary artery stenosis, coronary dominance, number of vessels diseased, myocardial jeopardy score, and ejection fraction. The overall perioperative mortality rate was 9.1%. There was a significant increase in perioperative mortality among female patients (p less than 0.05) and patients undergoing emergency surgery (p less than 0.05). Patients with left main stenosis of 80% or more or with balanced or left dominant circulation showed trends toward increased perioperative mortality. Life-table analysis showed that emergency surgery and left main stenosis of 80% or more correlated with increased long-term mortality (p less than 0.05). No other variable tested showed a significant correlation with either perioperative or long-term mortality. A comparison of these results with studies performed in the 1970s shows that there has been considerable change in those factors which place a patient at increased risk for mortality during surgical treatment of left main coronary artery stenosis.\r"

Forty-two healthy subjects served as a control group. Left ventricular hypertrophy was considered a left ventricular mass (LVM) echocardiographically calculated (Devereux formula), exceeding 244 gm or a LVM index exceeding 122 gm/m2 (greater than 2 SD from a previously studied normal population). AMA were found in 15 of 35 (43%) patients with HC and in 6 of 20 (30%) patients with hypertensive heart disease (p less than 0.01); in contrast, AMA were not present in the sera of athletes or in the sera of controls. Although the significance of AMA in subjects with pathologic myocardial hypertrophy has not yet been established, their absence in the sera of athletes strengthens the opinion that cellular changes, as a compensatory response of the myocardium to a work overload, have a physiologic fashion in these cases. Moreover, identification of AMA in the sera of athletes with disproportionate severe left ventricular hypertrophy of uncertain origin may be helpful to ensure a single diagnosis.\r"

To assess metabolic activity in segments with persistent defect, stress TI-201 tomography and positron emission tomography using nitrogen-13 ammonia and fluorine-18 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) were performed in 28 patients with healed myocardial infarction. The segments with TI-201 perfusion defect in electrocardiogram-determined infarcted areas were selected for assessment. Stress perfusion defect was detected in 61 segments by TI-201 tomography. Twenty-two patients (36%) showed transient defects with redistribution (group 1) and 39 showed persistent defects (group 2). Increase in FDG uptake was observed in 95% in group 1. Among group 2 patients, 15 segments (38%) showed an increase in FDG uptake (group 2A) while the remaining 24 (62%) did not have an increased uptake (group 2B). The decrease in nitrogen-13 ammonia perfusion was more severe in group 2B (-23 +/- 7%) than in group 2A (-13 +/- 9%) (p less than 0.005) and group 1 (-10 +/- 4%) (p less than 0.001). In addition, wall motion scores tended to be lower in group 2B (0.21 +/- 0.71), compared with group 2A (0.67 +/- 0.70) (p = 0.05) and group 1 (0.77 +/- 0.60) (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that metabolic viability was observed in approximately 40% of the segments with persistent TI-201 defect. Preservation of regional perfusion and wall motion in these areas was similar to that in areas with transient TI-201 defect.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs due to right ventricular disease shown by angiography underwent fulguration. Seven patients always had VT with the same morphology, and 4 had clinical VT with 2 or 3 different QRS waveforms. Five patients underwent a single fulguration and the other 6 underwent from 2 to 5 procedures; 2 to 14 shocks (mean 6) of 150 to 250 J were used. No serious complications occurred. At 31.5 +/- 9 months of follow-up, the arrhythmia was controlled in 8 patients, with continuation of previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drug therapy in 6 of 8. The number of VT episodes the year before and after fulguration was 0.5 +/- 0.7 vs 3.5 +/- 1.7 (p less than 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the success rate and the degree of prematurity of the onset of the local electrogram during VT: -36 +/- 31 ms for successes and -38 +/- 13 ms for failures. In 7 patients with monomorphic VT, there were 6 successes and 1 failure, and in 4 patients with several morphologies of VT, there were 2 successes and 2 failures (1 due to the appearance of a \"new\" VT). Thus, electrical fulguration of VT in patients with right ventricular disease is safe and most often effective, particularly in patients with monomorphic VT, when combined with antiarrhythmic drugs. In these patients, the usually recommended endocardial mapping criteria for the determination of the optimal fulguration site were not predictive of outcome. Further studies are necessary to better define the optimal site for fulguration.\r"

Thallium-201 SPECT was performed after exercise in all control subjects and 70 hypertensive patients, and after intravenous dipyridamole in 30 patients. A frequent finding in hypertensive patients was a fixed decrease in the normal lateral-to-septal count density ratio in immediate thallium-201 SPECT images (1.02 +/- 0.10 vs 1.17 +/- 0.08 in control subjects, p less than 0.00001) and in 3-hour delayed images (1.02 +/- 0.11 vs 1.11 +/- 0.08 in control subjects, p less than 0.00001). No significant difference in count density ratio was present in patients undergoing treadmill versus diypridamole intervention. In 35 patients the count density ratio was greater than 2.0 standard deviations below the normal mean, creating the false impression of a fixed lateral defect (i.e., myocardial infarction). In 12 patients, myocardial wall thickness was measured at end-diastole by 2-dimensional echocardiography. Wall thickness was increased (greater than 11 mm) in all patients. The mean lateral-to-septal wall thickness ratio was 1.08 +/- 1.11; in no patient was the ratio less than 0.76 to indicate selective septal hypertrophy. The lateral-to-septal wall thickness and lateral-to-septal thallium-201 count density ratios correlated poorly (r = 0.43).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thus, the FokI fragment types detected by the genomic clone that contain the mutation site differ in the normal B(+) DNA and the variant A(+) DNA. The FokI fragment type of the variant A(-) is the same as that of the A(+).

Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony and genetic distance methods both showed that the Japanese, Ainu, and Korean populations were closely related to each other. Aeta was found to show a relatively close relationship to these three populations, confirming the conclusion from previous studies of blood markers. In contrast, Vedda was quite different from the other four populations.\r"

Seventeen clones were identified, all of which carried insert fragments capable of hybridizing with the cDNA probe. Insert size of these clones varied from 15.0 to 19.8 kb. Partial restriction maps were constructed, which demonstrated the presence of at least seven groups of unique SP1 genomic clones and suggested the possibility of multiple genes coding for SP1. The multigene nature of SP1 was confirmed by hybridization of the SP1 cDNA probe to multiple bands on Southern blots of human genomic DNA. Further analysis with chromosomal DNA dot blot demonstrated the presence of homologous sequences on the X chromosome and autosomal chromosome 6. Thus, human SP1 is apparently coded for by more than one gene residing on the X and 6 chromosomes.\r"

This disorder was originally described in a large Indiana family of Swiss descent and is also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type II. In the Indiana family, the genetic basis of the disease is a variant of plasma prealbumin (transthyretin), which has a serine-for-isoleucine substitution at amino acid 84 of the 127-residue prealbumin molecule. We predicted that the corresponding mutation in the prealbumin gene consisted of a T-to-G change in codon 84 (which created an AluI recognition site) and then demonstrated the extra AluI site in the DNA of patients by Southern blot analysis with a genomic prealbumin probe. This verifies the protein findings at the DNA level and provides a direct, reliable DNA test for the Ser-84 prealbumin gene associated with Indiana/Swiss hereditary amyloidosis.\r"

Twenty patients received antilymphocyte serum initially while two patients received antithymocyte globulin. Fifteen patients received fluoxymesterone 10 mg by mouth three times a day with antilymphocyte serum, and all received prednisone during the course of antilymphocyte serum or antithymocyte globulin. There were seven responses (31.8 percent) to the first course with four complete responses and three partial responses. Six of 15 patients who received fluoxymesterone showed a response, compared with zero of five treated without androgens (p less than 0.05). Eight patients with no initial response and a patient who experienced a relapse after a complete response were re-treated with either antithymocyte globulin (six) or antilymphocyte serum (three), with four of nine patients (44 percent) having a response (three complete responses, one partial response). Overall, 10 of 22 patients (45 percent) had a response (six complete responses, four partial responses). Median survival for those without a response is six months. Median survival for those with a response has not been reached, with follow-up ranging from 18 to 70 months. This study shows the benefit of a second cycle of antilymphocyte serum or antithymocyte globulin and a possible role for concomitant androgens in this treatment of aplastic anemia.\r"

Approximately half of all bleeding episodes occurred from the upper Gl tract, with a lesion identified 81 percent of the time, usually peptic ulcer disease. Lower Gl bleeding occurred in one-third of bleeding episodes, with a diagnosis made in only 52 percent. Only three neoplasms were found and all were diagnosed by barium studies. No diagnosis was established in 47 percent of all bleeding episodes despite appropriate evaluation; in these patients, a mean follow-up of 39.6 months disclosed no premalignant or malignant lesions. Mortality associated with bleeding was less than 2 percent. These data suggest that a diagnosis is usually established in patients receiving anticoagulation who experience upper Gl bleeding, whereas the cause of lower Gl bleeding may remain occult even after a thorough evaluation; however, the absence of a definitive diagnosis carries a good prognosis.\r"

The two variables at entry most strongly associated with the subsequent development of a connective tissue disease were an abnormal nailfold capillary pattern (adjusted odds ratio = 26.82, 95 percent confidence interval = 4.69, 153.2) and an abnormal pulmonary function test result (odds ratio = 4.78, 95 percent confidence interval = 1.02, 22.41). The positive association of an abnormal barium esophagram, presence of antinuclear antibodies, and cutaneous abnormalities did not reach statistical significance. The development of connective tissue diseases in this group of patients is not rare. An abnormal nailfold capillary pattern is strongly associated with the subsequent development of systemic sclerosis or CREST syndrome in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon.\r"

Recently, the ACTH and cortisol responses to ovine corticotropin-releasing factor (oCRF) have been shown to be different in pituitary Cushing's disease than in Cushing's syndrome due to other causes. It is not known if the response to oCRF can distinguish pituitary Cushing's disease from those ACTH-secreting bronchial carcinoid tumors that respond to dexamethasone and metyrapone. A case of Cushing's syndrome due to an ACTH-secreting bronchial carcinoid is described in which the responses to dexamethasone, metyrapone, and oCRF were indistinguishable from the responses observed in pituitary Cushing's disease. A bronchial carcinoid tumor should be considered even when responses to dexamethasone, metyrapone, and oCRF suggest pituitary Cushing's disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Disabling pain, skeletal deformity, or risk of joint involvement characterize Paget's disease of bone. Because the disease often affects the elderly, for whom compliance is a problem, we investigated therapy with a single intravenous infusion of amino-hydroxypropylidene bisphosphonate (AHPrBP, previously APD). PATIENTS and METHODS: Eleven patients with mild but symptomatic Paget's disease and one patient with very severe disease were treated with AHPrBP administered as a single intravenous infusion of 60 mg over 24 hours. Follow-up with clinical and biochemical evaluations was performed over six months for all patients, and over one year for seven patients. RESULTS: Clinical improvement and normalization of biochemical parameters were observed in all patients except one with extremely severe disease. On average, plasma alkaline phosphatase activity fell progressively and significantly from 256 +/- 29 U/liter (mean +/- SEM) to 97 +/- 6 U/liter after six months, and to 102 +/- 11 U/liter after one year (normal: less than 120 U/liter). Urinary excretion of hydroxyproline decreased within seven days to normal (from 4.3 +/- 0.5 mumol/liter of glomerular filtrate [lGF] to 1.7 +/- 0.2 mumol/lGF; normal: 2.2 mumol/lGF). Thereafter, it remained within the normal range until one year (1.8 +/- 0.2 mumol/lGF after six months and 1.9 +/- 0.3 mumol/lGF after one year). Side effects were negligible. Two patients noted only a transient increase in body temperature. When bone scintigraphy was repeated after six months, it revealed a marked decrease of the activity of the disease. CONCLUSION: Due to the important and sustained inhibition of bone resorption induced by AHPrBP, a single infusion of 60 mg of the bisphosphonate leads to a rapid decline in activity and a long-standing remission of moderate Paget's disease, without significant side effects.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the molecular basis for aberrant expression of T cell antigens in T cell malignancies, the authors studied the immunophenotypes, rearrangements of T cell receptor (TCR)-beta chain genes, and transcription of TCR-alpha and -beta, CD3(T3), and CD2(T11) genes in 5 postthymic activated T cell lines, 2 lymphoblastic T cell lines, and 2 histiocytic cell lines. Rearrangements of TCR-beta genes and functional 1.6 kb transcripts of TCR-alpha gene were demonstrated in each of the 7 T cell lines, but not in the 2 histiocytic cell lines. There often was incomplete transcription of TCR-beta chain and CD3-delta genes in postthymic T cell malignancies. At least 3 patterns could be defined: Pattern A, presence of TCR-beta and CD3-delta transcripts; Pattern B, presence of CD3-delta but lack of TCR-beta transcripts; and Pattern C, lack of both TCR-beta and CD3-delta transcripts. Expression of TCR-beta gene could be induced by phorbol ester in 3 cell lines from postthymic T cell malignancies, indicating that there was functional rearrangement of the TCR-beta gene. CD2 transcripts were detected in 1 cell line from T lymphoblastic and 1 postthymic activated T cell malignancy. No transcripts of TCR-beta, CD2, and CD3 genes were detected in the 2 malignant histiocytic cell lines. These studies demonstrate a molecular mechanism for the aberrant expression of T cell antigens in malignancies derived from postthymic activated T cells and indicate that the detection of TCR-alpha transcripts may be useful for recognizing anaplastic T cell malignancies and distinguishing them from those of true histiocytic origin.\r"

  ".U": "88292509\r", 
  ".W": "Some patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) develop a high-grade, large-cell lymphoma associated with rapid deterioration of clinical status. This change in histologic appearance and clinical behavior of CTCL is similar to transformations of other hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms. From a group of 92 cases of CTCL, morphologic, immunologic and clinical features were studied in 17 cases of transformed CTCL. Transformation was noted, at presentation or subsequently, in either cutaneous or extracutaneous sites; remarkably, transformation was found at initial diagnosis of CTCL in 7 of 17 patients. T cell characteristics were maintained in all 17 cases of transformed CTCL; in 11 cases with complete phenotypes, there were 6 T-helper, 3 T-suppressor, and 2 aberrant T subtypes. The pre- and posttransformation phenotypes were similar in 3 of 7 cases tested over time (all T-helper); retention of T-suppressor phenotype was suggested in another case. T cell features were maintained in the other 3 cases, but the T subtypes were altered in 2 of these cases. Absent or diminished pan-T antigens (CD 5, CD 3, or UCHL1) were found in 9 of 17 cases. Leu-M1, Ki-1, or LN 2 antigens were expressed by transformed cells in 10 of 17 cases, often in patterns identical to Reed-Sternberg cells. Survival in patients with transformed CTCL was significantly shorter (median, 29 months) than in 44 CTCL patients without transformation (58 months, P = 0.015); survival after diagnosis of transformation was short (12 months). Patients with extracutaneous transformation had a shorter median survival after transformation (8 months) than those with transformation limited to skin (19 months). It is concluded that CTCL can transform morphologically to a large cell variant associated with aggressive behavior and shortened survival. Extracutaneous transformation apparently indicates a poorer prognosis than cutaneous transformation. Although transformed CTCL usually retains a T cell phenotype, some antigens are lost while other new antigens may be expressed. Recognition of transformed CTCL is facilitated by identification of the dysplastic cerebriform cell component, but often requires correlation of immunologic and clinical features.\r"

When expression of beta F1 and CD3 were considered together, 4 types of T lymphoma were delineated: 1) beta F1+CD3+; 2) beta F1+CD3-; 3) beta F1-CD3+, and 4) beta F1-CD3-. The first represented lymphomas with classical T immunophenotype. The second might represent T lymphomas with aberrant loss of CD3 expression. The third might represent T lymphomas with a putative second TCR or cases with an immature phenotype expressing cytoplasmic CD3 only. The fourth type included cases that may be derived from natural killer cells instead of T cells, cases of T lymphoma with aberrant loss of both beta F1 and CD3, and some cases of immature T cell (lymphoblastic) lymphoma. beta F1-CD3- lymphomas exhibited a remarkable predilection for the nasal region. beta F1 is useful in studying T cell lymphomas and distinguishing a novel immunophenotype frequently expressed by nasal lymphomas.\r"

Propofol induction produced significantly greater decreases in blood pressure, particularly in the 1-5 year age group. Heart rate was maintained well with all three induction techniques. Pain on injection into a vein on the dorsum of the hand was significantly more common with propofol despite the addition of lignocaine. However, this was mild in the majority of children and did not interfere with the induction of anaesthesia. The incidence of respiratory depression and other adverse effects was low with all three induction methods. The mean induction doses of both intravenous agents were greater in the 1-5-year age group. The ratio of thiopentone to propofol dose was approximately 2.5:1 in both age groups. The high incidence of pain on injection with propofol may prove to be a significant drawback to its otherwise satisfactory use in children.\r"

T-cell subset values, total serum IgE, and serum IgE to specific allergens (Dermatophagoides pteronyssimus, cat epithelium, dog dander, rye grass, egg white, and milk) were measured. The results showed that total and allergen-specific IgE levels were higher in atopic disease in infancy, but no statistical differences in T-cell subset values between seborrheic and atopic infants were found.

After discharge, patients entered into a chronic injection sclerotherapy program. Control of the acute bleeding episode (FIS, 91%, RIS, 95%) and the first hospital admission mortality (FIS, 34%, RIS, 44%) were similar. Eradication of varices was achieved in 16/19 and 13/16 cases in the two respective groups of patients who survived longer than 3 months, and only 2 of these patients (both of whom were in the RIS group) had a further major variceal bleed. The overall complication rate per injection was significantly lower in the FIS group (p less than 0.005). Twenty-six patients (14 FIS, 12 RIS) were alive at the end of the 4-year trial period. Of the total of 44 deaths, only 3 were not associated with a bleeding episode. Only five of the 29 patients who had their varices eradicated died during the trial period (median follow-up of 16 months). FIS has become the preferred method of treatment at the Groote Shuur Hospital, particularly in the long-term management of these patients. The procedure is safe, does not require a general anesthetic, and in long-term management, most patients can be treated on an outpatient basis. RIS should be reserved for the difficult recurrent acute bleeder, where the more controlled situation with a rigid scope under general anesthesia may provide safer and more effective sclerotherapy. The study stresses the importance of achieving eradication of all varices to prevent rebleeding and its attendant high mortality.\r"

Procedure mortality was 3.6% for CABG alone, 5.4% for PTCA alone, and 13.5% for the combined angioplasty and operation group (p less than 0.05 compared with CABG). All deaths in the PTCA group with subsequent CABG occurred in those patients taken emergently to CABG (5 of 20 patients). We conclude that with proper patient selection both forms of revascularization are safe and effective. However, emergency coronary bypass surgery in the event of failed angioplasty has a high risk.\r"

Additional epidemiological data were collected to identify the patient at higher risk for acquiring an infection. Patients were categorized into four groups: (1) no infection; (2) clinically determined infection without a culture or prescription of additional antibiotics; (3) clinical infection with no or negative wound culture and prescription of additional antibiotics; and (4) clinical infection with positive culture and need for additional antibiotics. Seven cefuroxime patients (13.5%) and 9 cefazolin patients (18.8%; p = 0.471) had a wound that became clinically infected (Groups 2-4). In a univariate analysis, 11 variables were statistically associated with the development of a wound infection. A logistic regression model defined 3 variables at an alpha level of 0.05 and 3 at an alpha level of 0.10 that predicted a wound infection. Patients were identified at high risk of wound infection if they had postoperative weight gain, long operative hospitalization, prolonged use of a Foley catheter, postoperative use of blood products, and operation performed by two specific surgeons. Our results indicated that closer observation of the high-risk patients and a definition of the mechanism of the infections are needed.\r"

Thirty-six (50%) of the 72 cataract extraction patients had at least one known risk factor for cataract formation, including trauma, intraocular inflammation, diabetes mellitus, syphilis, oral or topical steroid use, or previous eye surgery. Male patients were found to be a mean of 4.3 years younger than female patients, and diabetics were found to be a mean of 3.5 years older than nondiabetics.

The PAF antagonist SRI 63-441 significantly blocked ocular vascular permeability following either intravenous endotoxin or anterior chamber paracentesis as determined by the reduction in accumulation of 70,000-molecular-weight fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran or serum proteins into the anterior chamber. SRI 63-441 did not reduce increases in aqueous humor prostaglandin E2 levels. The efficacy of the PAF antagonist was additive in combination with either topical indomethacin or topical corticosteroid. Combined therapy almost completely prevented increases in ocular vascular permeability. These data support the conclusion that multiple mediators contribute to ocular vascular permeability and that combinations of pharmacologic agents may be superior to a single drug.\r"

All patients had antibodies to HSV (measured by ELISA) and all but three had HSV-specific cell mediated immunity (CMI) (measured by in vitro lymphoproliferation). Thirteen control subjects were negative for both tests. All three patients with absent CMI to HSV had suffered from severe EH and had depressed CMI to HSV for several months following an attack. In two of these EH patients, a positive CMI response was produced by in vitro removal of CD8 + ve T lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a panning technique. Thus the absence of CMI to HSV in these patients was due to suppressor cell function rather than a lack of specifically responsive cells. The other four EH patients with normal CMI to HSV had suffered less severe EH, but no association between the absence of CMI to HSV and serum IgE level or activity of the eczema was apparent in the atopic patients. No specific anti-HSV IgE antibody was detectable.\r"

Fifteen available specimens were diagnosed as atypical hyperplasias (four) or malignant lymphomas (11). The latter were classified as AILD-type (five), T-zone (four), lymphoepithelioid (one), and low-grade, unclassified lymphoma (one). Despite the histologic differences, all these lesions shared minor nuclear atypicalities and reactive AILD-type features such as prominent vascularity, plasma cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and residual germinal centers. All lesions were immunophenotyped as predominantly T cell. The chromosome pattern was characterized by the frequent presence of karyotypically unrelated abnormal clones and/or cells with nonclonal chromosome abnormalities, a large population of normal mitotic cells, and a high incidence of trisomies 3 and 5. Sequential cytogenetic and histologic studies in five patients revealed that atypical hyperplasia and lymphoma with AILD-type features shared the same cytogenetic characteristics, ie, an unstable coexistence of normal mitotic cells and small-clonal and/or nonclonal abnormal cells, and that histologic transformation from low-grade lymphoma to immunoblastic lymphoma was accompanied by a selective proliferation of abnormal clonal cells. The AILD-type histology and the characteristic karyotypic pattern may be the expression of a specific pathogenesis and may warrant the separation of these neoplasias from other peripheral T-cell lymphomas.\r"

Twenty percent (4/20) of the Ig kappa light chain-expressing CLL cells reacted with 17.109, a MoAb against a major CRI on human IgM autoantibodies that is encoded by a conserved Ig variable-region gene (V gene) of the V kappa IIIb sub-subgroup. Another MoAb specific for V kappa IIIb framework determinant(s) reacted exclusively with all the 17.109-reactive CLL cells. Only one of 20 kappa light-chain-expressing CLL cells reacted with 6B6.6, a monoclonal antibody specific for a CRI commonly found on rheumatoid factor (RF) paraproteins with light-chain variable regions of the V kappa IIIa sub-subgroup. Finally, greater than 20% (8/34) of all CLL reacted with G6, a MoAb specific for an Ig heavy chain-associated CRI present on several RF paraproteins. In contrast, these CRIs were expressed at significantly lower frequencies in NHL of follicular center cell origin. Only one of 30 NHL expressing kappa light chains reacted with the 17.109 MoAb. Also, in contrast to the concordance between the 17.109-CRI and V kappa IIIb framework determinant(s) in CLL, two lymphomas in addition to the 17.109-reactive lymphoma were recognized by the anti-V kappa IIIb framework MoAb. None of the NHL reacted with either the 6B6.6 or the G6 MoAbs. These results are the first to demonstrate that CLL and NHL differ with respect to the expression of autoantibody-associated CRIs. The data support the notion that NHL of follicular center cell origin differs from CLL in its utilization and/or somatic mutation of Ig variable-region genes. The physiological and immunotherapeutic implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

Uptake of 3H-thymidine by these purified myeloma cells was measured, and BSF-2 response was evaluated by stimulation index and delta cpm induced by rBSF-2. Myeloma cells from cases in stage I responded to rBSF-2 better than those in stage III. Moreover rBSF-2 responders also showed better response to chemotherapy. Therefore, these results suggest that in vitro response of myeloma cells to BSF-2 correlates with disease progression and clinical response in patients of MM.\r"

Therefore, we conducted the present study of 103 consecutively accrued diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) patients to define, independently of histologic subtypes, the prognostic importance of phenotyping. We used an extensive panel of monoclonal antibodies to T- and B-cell antigens to assign all patients immunologically into the T-cell (20 patients) or B-cell group (83 patients). The only significant differences in pretreatment clinical variables between the two patient groups were the higher frequency of bulky disease (greater than 10 cm) in B-cell patients (P = .008) and more frequent skin involvement in the T-cell group (P less than or equal to .001). Multiagent doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimens were employed as initial therapy in over 83% of the patients in each group. Our study revealed that disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly shorter in the T-cell patients than in the B-cell DLCL patients (median DFS, 10.8 months for T-cell and 42.7 months for B-cell; P = .01, log rank). No patient with T-cell DLCL remained disease free for longer than 2 years, whereas 55% of the B-cell group were disease free at 2 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses of all major prognostic factors of DFS suggest that the T-cell phenotype indicates an incurable subset of DLCL patients. Although the B-cell group had a twofold advantage in median survival (35 months v 18 months), actuarial overall survival was not significantly different between the two patient groups (P = .23). Our results indicate the need for new approaches in the search for a curative treatment for T-cell DLCL.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the composition and metabolism of glycosphingolipid (GSL), which is one of the cell surface constituents, during cell differentiation of human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line MOLT-3 cells were examined with special reference to their alterations in E rosette-forming capacity and expression of surface antigens specific for T-cell lineage. Three molecular species of neutral GSL and greater than or equal to 13 molecular species of acidic sialosyl-GSL (ganglioside) were detectable on high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) in untreated MOLT-3 cells. The major components were ceramide monohexoside and gangliosides GM3 and GD1a. When the cells were induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) to differentiate into more mature T cells, the ganglioside composition changed distinctively, and the total ganglioside content increased considerably; mono-, di-, and tri-sialosyl gangliosides concomitantly showed significant increase, but no new molecular species of GSL specific for the differentiation were detected. The activity of one sialyltransferases, CMP-sialic acid:CDH sialyltransferase, which synthesizes ganglioside GM3 and the total sialic acid content of the cell surface, parallelled the extent of cell differentiation. Examination of another human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, HPB-ALL, indicated that TPA could also induce the cells to differentiate along T-cell lineage and that changes in the ganglioside pattern during differentiation are similar to those of MOLT-3 cells. The results indicate that human T-lymphoid cell differentiation intimately involves elongation of neutral oligosaccharide-moieties and the addition of sialic acid residues to gangliosides, resulting in more mature T cells containing higher gangliosides. Both the sialyltransferase activity and the sialic acid content, as well as the ganglioside pattern, might be new biochemical markers specific for human T-lymphoblastic cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the clinical and biologic features of 10 cases of acute leukemia that met standard French-American-British (FAB) criteria for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but in which the blast cells also expressed the T-cell-associated CD2 surface antigen. All cases had greater than 3% myeloperoxidase and Sudan black B-positive leukemic blasts, and blasts from seven cases contained Auer rods. Reactivity of the cells with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) indicated that leukemic cells in all cases expressed myeloid-associated (CD11b, CD13) surface antigens, further supporting the diagnosis of AML. However, blasts from every patient coexpressed the T-cell-associated surface CD2 and CD7 as well as cytoplasmic CD3 antigens. Blasts from five patients expressed surface CD25, whereas blasts from only one expressed surface CD3. Five patients had rearranged T-cell receptor beta-chain genes, whereas only three had rearranged T-cell receptor gamma-chain genes. This pattern of lineage-related gene expression appears to define a distinct subtype of AML with T-lymphoid features (CD2+ AML) and could reflect either aberrant gene expression in leukemic blasts or transformation of a pluripotent stem cell having a flexible pattern of gene expression. Clinically, these 10 patients presented at an older age with a higher leukocyte count and a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy than did children whose blast cells were characteristic of myeloid leukemia. Patients with CD2+ AML also had poorer responses to remission induction therapy (50% v 80% entered complete remission, P = .05). However, each of the five children who failed induction chemotherapy on AML protocols had a striking response to drug combinations usually reserved for lymphoid leukemia. We conclude that this leukemia with mixed lymphoid and myeloid characteristics is a distinct biologic and clinical entity.\r"

An eventual relationship between these two rare entities is analyzed. Hairy cells (HCs) were present in the blood, bone marrow, and spleen. An excess of LGLs was found only in the blood and bone marrow. After splenectomy the patient received an alpha 2-interferon (alpha 2-IFN) treatment. The HCs surface phenotype was mu+delta+kappa+, CD20+, and CD25+. The LGLs consisted in CD3+, CD8+, HNK1+, WT31+ T lymphocytes. These were absent in the spleen. alpha 2-IFN treatment resulted in the disappearance of the HCs in the blood and bone marrow, whereas the LGLs remained unchanged. Before alpha 2-IFN treatment, peripheral blood cells, predominantly LGLs, exerted low cytotoxicity that increased up to a normal level after treatment. Using Southern blotting the authors studied the rearrangements of the T-cell receptor beta--chain (C beta) and gamma-chain (J gamma) genes and immunoglobulin heavy (JH)- and light (C kappa, C lambda)- chain genes. An unique JH and C kappa gene rearrangement was found in the blood and spleen, whereas C beta and J gamma gene rearrangements were present in the blood, not in the spleen. Under alpha 2-IFN treatment, the JH gene rearrangement fainted dramatically, in contrast to that of the C beta gene. The study of messenger RNA (mRNA) of the T cell receptor alpha and beta chains evidenced the 1.3-kilobase (kb) and 1.6-kb bands in the blood and their absence in the spleen. The patient was human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-II negative by Southern analysis of blood and spleen cells. It is concluded that the LGL expansion was clonal and not reactive to the HCL. Although the authors cannot definitely exclude that both HC and LGL proliferations stem in a common leukemic precursor, their findings support an association of the two entities.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is one of the hematopoietic growth factors that regulates the growth and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, thereby leading to the production of all the major blood cell types. The role of IL-3 in the regulation of pulmonary alveolar macrophage (PAM) production was investigated. IL-3 stimulated the proliferation and clonal growth of murine PAM with a dose-response curve similar to that of bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells. The IL-3-induced colony formation by cells outside the bone marrow appeared to be unique to PAM; IL-3 failed to cause colony formation by both peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM) and blood monocytes. Unlike bone marrow stem cells, PAM are unipotential and in vitro gave rise to only mononuclear phagocytes under the influence of IL-3. Nevertheless, cells derived from PAM cultures in media containing IL-3 displayed a high degree of heterogeneity in terms of their Fc receptor-mediated phagocytic activity. At low concentrations, IL-3 induced a synergistic response with colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), which resulted in an enhanced proliferative capacity of PAM. A synergistic effect was also observed by short-term exposure of PAM to IL-3 followed by incubating with CSF-1 alone. This study shows that IL-3 exhibited a macrophage growth factor activity unique to PAM.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that proteolysis plays an important role in some forms of inherited and acquired von Willebrand disease (vWD). Because calpains and one or more enzymes released from polymorphonuclear leukocytes are known to proteolyze von Willebrand factor (vWF) in vitro with resultant loss of large multimers similar to that seen in IIA vWD, they have been suggested as being responsible for the proteolysis in vivo. Using monoclonal epitope mapping, we have examined the proteolysis of the vWF subunit by porcine calcium-activated neutral proteases (calpains) and human leukocyte elastase to determine whether they produce the vWF proteolytic cleavage products seen in normal individuals and IIA vWD. Purified vWF was digested with porcine calpains I and II. We found no difference in the size, location, and quantity of the fragments produced by calpain I v calpain II. New fragments were detected of approximately 200, 170, 150, and 125 Kd. There was no evidence for generation of the native 140 and 176 Kd fragments. Some loss of the native fragments was seen, which suggests that they were further cleaved. Epitope mapping of the 170- and 150-Kd calpain-cleaved fragments revealed them to be from different parts of the molecule than the regions from which the native 176- and 140-Kd fragments derived. This was further supported by determination of the amino-terminal sequence of the calpain-cleaved 170- and 150-Kd fragments. Digestion of vWF with human leukocyte elastase produced new fragments at 210/205, 190, 170/165, 145/140, and 130/125 Kd. No generation of native fragments was detected. Monoclonal epitope mapping of the 145/140-Kd elastase-cleaved band proved that it derived from the carboxyl-terminal portion of the vWF molecule, whereas the native 140-Kd fragment is derived from the amino-terminal end. Neither calpains nor human leukocyte elastase produced the proteolyzed fragments present in normal and IIA vWD and, therefore, probably do not cause the loss of large multimers that is seen in that disorder.\r"

  ".U": "88294341\r", 
  ".W": "The authors have analyzed the involvement of V gamma and J gamma segments in TRG gamma rearrangement from a series of 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), including 25 T- and 15 B-lineage cases, in which TRG gamma are rearranged. Sixty-five rearranged alleles were studied. The authors first describe the cloning and sequencing of two variable segments, V gamma 11 and psi V gamma 12, which rearrange in T- and B-neoplastic cells. To date three subgroups of translatable V gamma segments have been described. The authors show that V gamma 11 is the unique member of a new fourth V gamma subgroup that also rearranges in normal polyclonal T cells and that psi V gamma 12 is located at 5-kilobase (kb) downstream to V gamma 11. As shown by DNA sequence analysis, V gamma 11 shares a 60% homology with V gamma 10 (third subgroup) and a 50% homology with V gamma 9 (second subgroup) but no appreciable homology with the V gamma segments from the first family. In contrast to psi V gamma 12, V gamma 11 is translatable. In this paper the authors have also attempted to determine which V gamma segments were rearranged in the ALL cases by hybridization with a J gamma probe and genomic probes specific of the four subgroups. In the 54 instances in which the rearrangement was consistent with J gamma 1 or J gamma 2 involvement, the authors have identified the corresponding V gamma segments and have not found any other rearrangements suggestive of the existence of further V regions. The V gamma segments, belonging to the first subgroup, were the most frequently used (41 alleles). V gamma 9, V gamma 10, V gamma 11, and psi V gamma 12 were found rearranged in cases 3, 4, 5, and 1, respectively. No cases using the pseudo psi V gamma 1, psi V gamma 5, and psi V gamma 6 segments were found. Pseudo V gamma segments were not found rearranged in T cells, while V gamma 2 and V gamma 4, segments are frequently used. In contrast to the V gamma I gene rearrangement, the involvement of the V gamma II, V gamma III, and V gamma IV subgroups was most frequently observed in T-ALL with stage II differentiation (CD7+, CD4+, and/or CD8+, CD3-), than in those with stage I (CD7+, CD4-, CD8-, CD3-), than in those with stage I (CD7+, CD4-, CD8-, CD3-) and stage III (CD7+, CD4+/-CD8+/-CD3+).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Hybridization of a DQ-beta probe to Bg1 II-digested DNA showed that a variant of DQw3, characterized by a 4.3 kb fragment and related to the serological specificity TA10, was markedly increased among DR4 positive RA patients. HLA-DR1 was also increased in RA and appeared to be independent of the increase of DR4. Although the DR1 association was weaker, it was observed in both patients with and without RF. In contrast, DR4 was found to be increased significantly only in the RF positive group of patients, as previously observed. Development of RA in multiple-case families was found to be linked to the inheritance of DR4 positive haplotypes. The possible role of risk factors associated with polymorphic markers of the T-cell receptor genes was investigated. An allelic marker associated with one of the variable gene subfamilies of the beta-chain was found to be associated with RA. The results suggest that susceptibility for development of RA is influenced by alleles of the T-cell receptor in conjunction with the class II HLA factors with which the T-cell receptor interacts in the course of the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is closely associated with the histocompatibility antigen HLA-B27. Pathogenesis of AS is thought to involve interactions between B27 and certain enterobacterial antigens. However, this is uncertain and contested by some. The present paper argues that the presence of statistically raised specific serum IgA to a common enterobacterial heat modifiable major outer membrane protein (h-momp; Mr 35,000) in active AS (N = 25; IgA = 1485 +/- 20) in comparison to controls, most notably hospital patients without known arthropathies or gastrointestinal disease (N = 12; IgA = 548 +/- 59), supports an inductive contribution of enterobacterial antigens to the pathogenesis of secondary AS. Serum IgG and IgM did not statistically differ. Raised specific serum IgA to h-momp might indicate enterobacterial antigenic stimulation from the gastrointestinal tract. It does not necessarily imply direct involvement in the pathogenesis of primary AS. H-momp appears to be a convenient tool for serological studies of AS and at present is likely to be more suitable than other bacterial antigens, notably those with B27-like epitopes. Namely, the confirmed presence in AS of enterobacteria with freely accessible B27-like antigenic epitopes on their cell surface might induce unusual tolerance to these organisms in B27 positive hosts, thus causing chronic inflammation, initially sacroiliitis (and spondylitis) due to the proximity of presacral and para-aortic colon draining lymph nodes, later becoming more generalized (for reasons unclear) to include other lesions (e.g. peripheral arthritis, uveitis, enthesopathies). Thus, antibodies to B27-like antigenic epitopes need not be detectable or may be absent. Also, cellular immune responsiveness to these antigens might be involved.\r"

These patients were referred to a tertiary care center after their fractures failed to unite after numerous surgical attempts as well as a course of electrical stimulation. Fourteen patients had nonunion of the tibia, and one had nonunion of a humerus fracture. Twelve were originally Gustillo Grade II or III fractures, and four sustained multiple injuries. The average duration of nonunion before presentation to the clinic was 22.5 months. Five patients presented as infected nonunions. Each nonunion was analyzed with specific reference to injury mechanism, skin and bone conditions, presence of infection, primary treatment protocol, and selection criteria for treatment with electrical stimulation. Review of the data revealed that the most common factor associated with failure of electrical stimulation treatment was inappropriate patient selection, according to criteria previously published for the use of these techniques. Treatment modalities consisted of intramedullary fixation in three, open reduction and internal fixation using Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) technique in nine, and external fixation in three. All patients were bone grafted. The mean follow-up duration was 1.5 years. Nonunions were healed in fourteen patients. Twelve were fully weight bearing at six months, and one at 12 months. Success was defined as restoration of a functional extremity, giving a success rate of 87%. A thorough reevaluation of the original treatment regimen and a return to basic principles of operative fracture management and bone grafting can yield excellent results, even in patients with recalcitrant nonunion.\r"

Roentgenologic and histologic assessment showed that new bone formation in the electrical stimulation group was more exuberant than those in the other two groups in observation periods from three to eight weeks. However, at 12 weeks no difference was observed among the three groups. Biomechanical analysis showed definite increases in the breaking strength and bending stiffness of the fracture healing tibia in Group I, especially at six weeks after surgery. However, at 12 weeks no significant difference was observed among the three groups. Therefore, electrical stimulation of fracture healing has a positive effect only at the midphase of the healing process, and it does not lead to faster fracture healing.\r"

Subjects preferred the square waveforms over a paired spike monophasic waveform.

Theoretically, this could lead to a higher hydroxyproline content and greater mechanical strength than in a sutured anastomosis. To test the hypothesis, 83 rats underwent left colon resection and inverted primary anastomosis with either one layer of sutures (NG group) or fibrin glue (FG group). Seven-day FG anastomoses showed less adhesions (P = .02) but one subclinical leakage and a further radiologic one, compared with a greater amount of adhesions but no leakages in the NG group. The mean bursting pressures (mmHg) in the FG and NG groups, respectively, were 25 +/- 20 (SD) and 63 +/- 23 (N.S.) 30 minutes after surgery, 107 +/- 33 and 115 +/- 30 after one day, 81 +/- 31 and 133 +/- 26 (P less than .001) after four days, and 161 +/- 36 and 175 +/- 24 after seven days. The somewhat earlier rise in hydroxyproline content in the glued anastomoses did not lead to significant intergroup differences. The glued anastomoses were thus weak during the critical lag period of healing. Also, by preventing adhesion formation, the glue may reduce the extra blood supply from perianastomotic vessels. The outcomes might have differed more under demanding experimental or clinical situations.\r"

  ".W": "Normal and neoplastic mammary cells from both human and rodent sources grow in culture in response to a number of hormones and growth factors. However, with the exception of a few human tumor lines, a consistent growth-promoting effect of estrogens on mammary cells has not been observed. Mammary cells can be shown to respond to other hormones and factors, such as PRL, hydrocortisone, and epidermal growth factor. Recent observations suggest that the pH indicator dye phenol red, found in most media, may be masking any exogenous estrogenic effects by acting as a weak estrogen. To test this possibility, we reexamined the effects of estradiol (E2) and the antiestrogen keoxifene on the growth of normal human, mouse, and rat mammary cells in the absence of phenol red. Primary cultures of these mammary cells were grown within a rat tail collagen gel matrix in a serum-free medium made up of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's Modified Eagles' medium (1:1) with and without phenol red. The medium was supplemented with various hormones and growth factors. These supplements were selected for each cell type to produce a variety of conditions from nongrowing to rapidly growing. The effects of E2 (10(-10)-10(-8) M, keoxifene (10(-9)-10(-6) M), and phenol red on growth under these various conditions were examined. Phenol red had no effect on growth, and its absence did not restore a response to E2. Keoxifene, in the presence or absence of E2, also had no effect on growth. Although E2 had no effect on growth, it was able to induce a 150% increase in the progesterone receptor levels in normal mouse mammary cells in culture, indicating that the cells retain their capacity to respond to E2. This work supports the idea that the effect of estrogens on growth in vivo may be mediated through some other factor(s).\r"

Using highly specific and sensitive RIAs and immunoaffinity chromatography to investigate whether this extrabrain CRF circulates in the rat, we found low but clearly measurable levels in peripheral plasma (mean, 11.4 +/- 0.8 pg/ml). Immunological findings were corroborated by fast protein liquid chromatography, which resolves peptides by both hydrophobicity and ionic charge. With this approach the major immunoreactive peak was eluted at the position of synthetic rat CRF standard. To assess whether levels of peripheral plasma CRF-like immunoreactivity (CRF-LI) vary in parallel with those of hypothalamic CRF-LI, we performed studies with low and high dose dexamethasone administration and withdrawal, adrenalectomy, and hypophysectomy. Seven days after oral administration of dexamethasone, there was a decrement in the levels of peripheral plasma and hypothalamic CRF-LI. Depending on the dose, recovery was also found 7 days after cessation of the treatment. After either adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy, there were increments in the levels of CRF-LI in both peripheral plasma and hypothalamus. Thus, concentrations of CRF-LI in the peripheral plasma and in the hypothalamus vary in parallel in response to alterations in the pituitary-adrenal axis.\r"

In the present study we evaluated the effects of interleukin-1 on Leydig cell function in primary culture. hCG-stimulated testosterone formation was markedly reduced by IL-1, with an ED50 of 1 U/ml. Basal testosterone production was slightly enhanced in the presence of low concentrations of IL-1, while high concentrations of IL-1 inhibited testosterone formation. Significant inhibition of hCG-stimulated testosterone formation was noted as early as 8 h after the addition of IL-1. IL-1 also inhibited hCG-stimulated cAMP formation, as well as 8-bromo-cAMP- and forskolin-stimulated testosterone synthesis. Furthermore, LH binding to Leydig cells was reduced by human IL-1. The inhibitory effects of IL-1 were reversed only partially by the addition of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (0.1 mM), even though prostaglandin E2 formation was completely blocked. This indicates that the observed effects of IL-1 are not completely mediated by increased PGE2 formation. The present study suggests that IL-1 is a potent modulator of Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Decreased testosterone formation may modulate the immune response and contribute to the catabolic changes occurring during infection.\r"

Bovine MIS purified from newborn testicular tissue inhibited spontaneous oocyte meiosis in vitro in the rat. These studies show that partially purified recombinant MIS produced from a human MIS genomic construct caused inhibition of oocyte meiosis, but when purified to homogeneity, the effect was lost. Addition of low concentrations of the detergent Nonidet P-40, used to maintain stability in the purified bovine preparations, however, restored the MIS inhibitory effect to the human preparation, which could, in turn, be blocked by a polyclonal antibody raised to human recombinant MIS; Nonidet P-40 itself caused no inhibition. Since we have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and MIS are antagonistic in a number of other systems, we tested the effect of EGF on the ability of MIS to inhibit oocyte meiosis. EGF added to the medium at a dose that caused no effect on oocytes (25 ng/ml) blocked the MIS inhibitory action on spontaneous rat oocyte meiosis, while EGF had no effect on a known oocyte meiosis inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. These data indicate that human recombinant MIS can inhibit oocyte meiosis in the ovary and that its regulatory effect can be modulated by EGF, which appears to be an antagonist of MIS.\r"

Our results indicate that 1) intradialytic hypoxemia observed with both membranes does not seem to be exclusively related to the well-known membrane-dependent leukopenia; 2) platelet activation, as demonstrated by the plasma BTG increase, appears to be an exclusive cellulosic membrane-related phenomenon; 3) at the same time platelet activation seems to be the major factor responsible for high FN levels, the highest FN levels occurring concurrently with the lowest platelet count.\r"

Measurements were made with positron emission tomography. After 0.015 ml/kg OA was injected into the LCL (Lobar, n = 5), lung water increased in the left dorsal region from 37 +/- 5 to 50 +/- 8 ml/100 ml lung (P less than 0.05), PTCER was 533 +/- 59 10(-4)/min, and regional PBF decreased 62%. No significant change occurred in the uninjured right dorsal lung where PTCER was 85 +/- 32. In the left ventral region PTCER was 357 +/- 60, PBF decreased only 31%, and the increase in lung water was less (25 +/- 3 to 30 +/- 6). In contrast after 0.08 ml/kg OA was injected via the right atrium (Diffuse, n = 6), PTCER (283 +/- 94) was lower in the left dorsal region of this group than in the corresponding region of the Lobar group (P less than 0.05). The increase in lung water, however, was the same, but no change occurred in PBF distribution. These results indicate important differences between the two methods of causing lung injury with OA. After injury lung water accumulates primarily in dependent portions of lung and is not always accompanied by a decrease in regional PBF. These decreases, when they occur, may instead indicate severe vascular injury.\r"

A mixture of F + T3 + PRL, but not any combination of two hormones, increased both distensibility [1.71 +/- 0.12 (SE) ml of air/g wet wt at 40 cmH2O, V40] and stability (1.16 +/- 0.09 ml of air per g wet wt at 5 cmH2O, V5) to near full-term values, above values resulting from treatment with F alone (0.91 +/- 0.12 and 0.43 +/- 0.09 ml/g, P less than 0.01). Only F had an effect when given alone, V40 increasing (P less than 0.05). Treatment with F + T3 (0.81 +/- 0.18 ml/g) and F + E (0.77 +/- 0.07 ml/g) increased V5 above values obtained with F alone (P less than 0.05). Alveolar saturated phosphatidylcholine (SPC) was higher after treatment with F + T3 (161 +/- 52 micrograms/g), F + T3 + PRL (156 +/- 53 micrograms/g, P less than 0.05), and F + E (113 +/- 40 micrograms/g, P = 0.07) than after F (12 +/- 3 micrograms/g).

The average concentration of IL-1 alpha required for half-maximal stimulation of PGE2 was 4.6 +/- 1.5 pM (+/- SEM) (n = 6), whereas for IL-1 beta half-maximal stimulation was observed at a concentration of 1.3 +/- 0.24 pM (n = 6). Both direct and competitive binding experiments were performed. In direct binding experiments, IL-1 alpha bound with a Kd of 66 pM (n = 1), while IL-1 beta bound with a Kd of 4 pM (n = 2). In competitive binding experiments, IL-1 alpha inhibited binding of 125I-IL-1 alpha with a Ki of 33-36 pM (n = 2) and binding of 125I-IL-1 beta with a Ki of 51-63 pM (n = 2). IL-1 beta inhibited binding of 125I-IL-1 alpha with a Ki of 2-3 pM (n = 2) and binding of 125I-IL-1 beta with a Ki of 7 pM (n = 2). The binding data were best fit by a model specifying a single class of receptors with homogeneous affinity for either IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta and with an abundance of 3,000-14,000 sites per cell. Autoradiography showed that the vast majority of the synoviocytes within the cultures possessed IL-1 receptors. Comparison of biological response curves with the binding curves indicates that the observed receptors exhibit sufficiently high affinity to mediate the response of human synoviocytes to low picomolar concentrations of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta.\r"

To determine if ischemic injury alters vascular contractility by increasing smooth muscle cell calcium or calcium influx, the renal blood flow (RBF) response to reductions in RPP within the autoregulatory range and to RNS were tested before and after a 90-min intrarenal infusion of verapamil or diltiazem in 7-d ischemic ARF rats. Both calcium entry blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, blocked the aberrant vasoconstrictor response to a reduction in RPP and RNS (both P less than 0.001). In a second series of experiments the potential role of an ischemia-induced endothelial injury and of the absence of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) production were examined to explain the lack of vasodilatation to acetylcholine. Acetylcholine, bradykinin (a second EDRF-dependent vasodilator), or prostacyclin, an EDRF-independent vasodilator, was infused intrarenally for 90 min, and RBF responses to a reduction in RPP and RNS were tested in 7-d ischemic ARF rats. Neither acetylcholine nor bradykinin caused vasodilatation or altered the slope of the relationship between RBF and RPP. By contrast, prostacyclin increased RBF (P less than 0.001), but did not change the vascular response to changes in RPP. It was concluded that the abnormal pressor sensitivity to a reduction in RPP and RNS was due to changes in renovascular smooth muscle cell calcium activity that could be blocked by calcium entry blockers. A lack of response to EDRF-dependent vasodilators, as a result of ischemic endothelial injury, may contribute to the increased pressor sensitivity of the renal vessels.\r"

Previous studies have demonstrated that ELISA assays of splenic fragment culture supernatants detect antibodies with affinities of 5 x 10(6) M-1 or greater. We therefore also analyzed the cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies derived from hybridomas. This permitted an assessment of antibodies with lower binding affinities. Cross-reactivity was detected more frequently among these hybridomas.

With plasma kallikrein, C1s and beta-Factor XIIa, this cleavage occurs at the reactive site residue P1 (Arg444); with neutrophil elastase, it takes place near P1, probably at residue P3 (Val442). After these cleavages, C1-inhibitor is inactivated and its conformation is modified. Moreover, in vivo, cleaved C1-inhibitor is removed from the blood stream more rapidly than the intact serpin, which suggests that proteolysis unmasks sites responsible for cellular recognition and the uptake of the cleaved inhibitor. In the study reported here, we show, using an MAb, that an identical neoepitope is created on C1-inhibitor after the cleavage of its exposed loop by plasma kallikrein, C1s, beta-Factor XIIa, and by neutrophil elastase.\r"

  ".W": "Histamine releasing factors (HRFs) have been demonstrated to be secreted by human lymphocytes and monocytes (alveolar macrophages); however, none has been purified to date. Because of the similarity of our HRF to the physical chemical properties of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), we have assessed the ability of preparations of IL-1 and TNF to cause basophil histamine release (HR). Human recombinant pro-IL-1 beta, recombinant mature IL-1, and, to a lesser extent, human recombinant TNF caused significant HR from a subpopulation of donor basophils. The pro-IL-1 beta elicited a dose response between 40 and 800 ng/ml; higher concentrations were inhibitory. Approximately 30% of subjects tested are responsive to either mature IL-1 or TNF. These share the same responder subset, but the magnitude of the TNF response is considerably less. A response to the pro-IL-1 was restricted to those subjects with prominent HR to anti-IgE; the response to mature IL-1 and TNF was unrelated to the response to anti-IgE. As in other functional assays, the pro-IL-1 is 50- to 100-fold less potent than mature IL-1, and unlike human HRF, it is highly unstable and rapidly loses activity. Mononuclear cell-derived HRF differs in physicochemical properties from IL-1 or TNF; nevertheless, it appears likely that a variety of cytokines may possess histamine-releasing capability.\r"

Sera from 59 patients presenting with acute asthma to the David Grant Medical Center emergency room at Travis Air Force Base during the spring \"epidemic\" of asthma were assayed for IgE antibody (Ab) to five allergens (mite, cat, cockroach, ryegrass pollen, and ragweed) with RAST. Control sera were obtained from 34 patients without asthma and 25 employees. The results demonstrate that 92% of the patients with asthma had greater than 200 units of IgE Ab to ryegrass pollen (approximately 20 ng of IgE Ab per milliliter) compared to 14% of the control subjects (chi 2 = 69; p less than 0.0001; odds ratio = 69). Some of the grass pollen--allergic patients also had increased levels of IgE Ab to ragweed, but only 25% had greater than 200 units. In contrast, there was no significant difference between subjects with asthma and control subjects in the prevalence of IgE Ab to the three indoor allergens (mite, cockroach, and cat). Twelve percent of the patients with asthma compared to 5% of the control subjects had greater than 200 units of IgE Ab to one of these three (chi 2 = 0.98; p greater than 0.1; odds ratio = 2.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intracutaneous skin tests (STs) and RAST with the common allergens, grass pollen, house dust mite, and cat dander, were performed on 660 adult patients. In 117 patients (18%), we found 140 discordances (7%) in a total number of 1980 ST and RAST combinations. In agreement with studies in the literature, greater than 80% of the discordances consisted of positive skin reactions without detectable allergen-specific IgE antibodies in serum. The percentages of discordant results were similar for the three allergens. Reproducibility of both the RAST and the ST was evaluated in the discordant group. Repetition of the routine RAST procedure elicited results similar to those in the first test in 81% (105/130). A second ST elicited identical results in 89% (47/53). In addition to the routine IgE antibody assay, sera of patients with a positive ST but without detectable IgE antibodies were tested in two other RAST systems: (1) a RAST with allergen extracts from the same production batch as the ST reagents, and (2) the Pharmacia RAST. In spite of having a clearly positive ST, sera from 68 (80%) of 85 patients remained completely negative in all three RAST systems. Histamine release (HR) in vitro from washed leukocytes was studied in 35 patients with a reproducible positive ST and negative RAST results with serum. Interpretation of this test was possible in 28 patients. In 82% (23/28) of these patients, clearly detectable HR was found with the relevant allergen extract. A role of IgE in the skin reactions and HR tests was confirmed by positive RAST results with IgE that was affinity purified from serum of seven of these patients. Allergen-specific IgG4 antibodies are unlikely to be implicated, since no antibodies against grass pollen and house dust mite were detectable in sera of these patients. Only 18% of the patients with an unexplained skin reaction with cat dander have detectable IgG4 antibodies, but these antibodies were found in a similar frequency in a nonallergic, ST negative control group. Low total IgG responses precluded false negative RAST results caused by competition of IgG antibodies with IgE antibodies. There were no significant differences in the degree of complement activation in vitro by house-dust extracts between healthy control subjects, nonallergic patients, and patients with unexplained skin reactivity. It is concluded that a high proportion of the positive skin reactions with common inhalant allergens, which are not accompanied by a positive RAST, are probably caused by IgE antibodies that are not detectable in serum with any of the RAST procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Over 90% of the vaccinated children were greater than or equal to 24 mo of age. A higher proportion of cases was reported to have occurred within the first two months after vaccination, with 10 cases occurring within 72 h of vaccination. Vaccination did not alter the expected frequencies of the different clinical entities associated with invasive H. influenzae disease. No estimates of clinical efficacy are possible based on the adverse events submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.\r"

The isolates were studied to investigate whether the major outer membrane proteins (MOMPs) changed during persistence. The relationship between isolates was analyzed by fingerprinting their chromosomal DNA. The fingerprints of eight strains (isolated from eight patients) with various MOMP compositions were different, whereas fingerprints of isolates with identical MOMP compositions were indistinguishable. In 12 patients, two or more strains with different MOMP compositions were found; one strain was isolated from the sputum samples of each of the six remaining patients. In seven of the 12 patients, strains with different MOMPs but with indistinguishable fingerprints were found. The differences were found in proteins b,c (five patients) and d (five patients). In patients with COPD, the MOMPs of H. influenzae are subject to changes that may enable this bacterium to escape immunological defense mechanisms.\r"

We report that the combination of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddCyd) and recombinant interferon-alpha-A (rIFN-alpha-A) acts synergistically against HIV-1 replication in vitro. Various cell types (peripheral blood leukocytes, a CD4-positive T cell line, and two monocyte-macrophage lines) have been studied. For each set of dose-effect data, the degree of drug interaction was quantitatively assessed with the median-effect principle and the isobologram equation by using a computer analysis. Under various culture conditions using several concentrations of drugs, multiplicities of infectious virus, and assay systems, antiviral synergism was consistently observed against HIV-1 replication without enhanced cell toxicity. Synergism was seen at concentrations as low as 0.02 microM ddCyd plus 4 U of rIFN-alpha-A/mL or 0.01 microM ddCyd plus 8 U of rIFN-alpha-A/mL, whereas 10-fold higher concentrations were usually required to achieve similar effects with single drugs.\r"

During her hospitalization and after her death, 38 hospital personnel developed an acute respiratory illness. Adenovirus type 3 infection was documented by culture in 18 of the 38 individuals and by seroconversion in one additional employee. Four of 34 asymptomatic hospital personnel exposed to the index case also seroconverted. Thus, 23 personnel were considered to have confirmed infections, and 22 of these 23 reported direct contact with the index case. Acquisition of infection was associated with the number and type of contacts. Protection against infection was associated with detectable serum-neutralizing antibody in the early serological sample. Restriction enzyme analysis using six different endonucleases indicated that all isolates of virus were type 3a and had identical genetic composition. This study underscores the importance of adenovirus as a cause of nosocomial infection and indicates that genetic analysis of viral DNA is a powerful tool for studying common-source outbreaks.\r"

Blood lymphocytes and their subsets were counted with a fluorescent activated cell sorter. CD8+ (putative suppressor) lymphocytes were significantly reduced in the first week of the disease but total lymphocytes, total T and CD4+ (putative helper) cells were not altered. This reduction depended on the nature of the preceding infection. Serum complement C3 and C4 concentrations remained normal and immune complexes were rarely detected with a C1q binding assay. Complement-fixing antibodies to human peripheral nerve antigens were discovered in the serum of 7% of patients but only 1% of controls. Complement-fixing antibodies to galactocerebroside were not discovered in any sera. Enzyme-linked immunoassays detected increased antibody responses to galactocerebroside but none at all to human P2 myelin protein in the patient sera. Forty microliter of serum from five patients injected into the sciatic nerves of rats did not induce significantly more demyelination than the serum from control patients. It is concluded that auto-immune responses can only be detected by these techniques in a small minority of patients with acute idiopathic neuropathy.\r"

  ".U": "88300167\r", 
  ".W": "Severely head-injured patients are hypermetabolic/hypercatabolic and exhibit many aspects of the postinjury acute-phase response. These patients have hypoalbuminemia, hypozincemia, hypoferremia, hypercupria, fever, and increased synthesis of acute-phase proteins such as ceruloplasmin and higher C-reactive protein levels. It has been suggested that increased interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the ventricular fluid may be responsible, at least in part, for these metabolic abnormalities. In the present study, serum albumin levels were evaluated throughout an 18-day study period in 62 head-injured patients receiving aggressive nutritional support. Hypoalbuminemia (mean +/- standard error of the mean 3.10 +/- 0.2 gm/dl; normal value 3.5 to 5 gm/dl) was observed upon hospital admission; these albumin levels continued to decrease until 2 weeks postinjury, despite aggressive nutritional support. This hypoalbuminemia may be mediated via altered endothelial permeability properties due to endothelial cell dysfunction caused by cytokines such as IL-1. Transendothelial movement of albumin was assayed using a pulmonary artery endothelial cell culture system. Both a crude macrophage supernatant derived from a murine P388D cell line having IL-1 activity (mIL-1) and human recombinant IL-1 (rIL-1) were tested. The amount of albumin transferred was time- and concentration-dependent, with maximal transfer at 24 hours and 20 U of mIL-1 per 0.5 ml of culture medium. Endothelial permeability changes observed after incubation with mIL-1 were confirmed using rIL-1. Compared to control cultures, 20 U of rIL-1 and 20 U of mIL-1 increased albumin transfer across endothelial monolayers 205% and 459%, respectively. These findings suggest that the mechanism of hypoalbuminemia seen after severe head trauma can be explained in part by IL-1-induced endothelial cell injury, resulting in enhanced endothelial permeability to albumin.\r"

In this study, cells derived from primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the posterior fossa (PNET-PF) were examined for their sensitivity to LAK cytolysis utilizing an in vitro 4-hour chromium-51-release assay. Five early-passage cell lines, derived from primary PNET-PF, demonstrated significant sensitivity to LAK cell cytolysis. Lysis was equally effective in culture medium and cerebrospinal fluid. Three freshly excised PNET-PF exhibited similar susceptibility to lysis by autochthonous LAK cells. Greatly increased expansion of LAK cell cultures could be achieved by short-term stimulation with monoclonal anti-CD3 antibodies in addition to interleukin-2 activation. These findings constitute the preliminary in vitro foundations for potential intrathecal adoptive immunotherapy of PNET-PF with LAK cells.\r"

In 12 of 27 patients with bone involvement SPECT and planar scintigraphy showed essentially the same findings. In 15 patients SPECT was superior to planar scintigraphy. In three of these patients SPECT detected lesions while planar scan was normal. In the other 12 patients SPECT showed better anatomic localization and defined the full extent of the lesion. This was most obvious in patients with involvement of sphenoid, petrous, clivus, maxilla, and zygomatic bones. Our findings confirm the potential of SPECT to detect lesions in deep bones that are overlapped by superficial bony structures that cannot be visualized clearly with planar scintigraphy.\r"

In 12/16 patients with healing of lytic disease on x-ray a paradoxical deterioration in the bone scan appearances after 3 mo treatment was seen. This was characterized by increased activity in baseline lesions and the appearance of new foci of tracer uptake; changes which are indistinguishable from progressive disease. After 6 mo successful treatment the bone scan improved with reduced tracer uptake and no new lesions since the 3-mo scan. New lesions appearing after 6 mo indicated progressive disease. These changes are attributed to a flare in osteoblast activity induced by successful systemic therapy and confirmed by a transient rise in osteocalcin and ALP-Bl. After 1 mo of treatment 15/16 responders showed a rise in both parameters compared with only 5/23 nonresponders (p = less than 0.001). The flare response is the rule rather than the exception after successful systemic therapy for bone metastases. The appearance of new lesions or increasing activity in known lesions during the first 3 mo is as likely to herald radiological response as disease progression.\r"

In all patients, SPECT revealed either multiple or focal uptake defects, the latter corresponding with focal signs or symptoms in all but one case. Computerized tomography showed a diffuse cerebral atrophy in eight of 12 patients, magnetic resonance imaging exhibited changes like atrophy and/or leukoencephalopathy in two of five cases. Our data indicate that both disturbance of cerebral amine metabolism and alteration of local perfusion share in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia complex. SPECT is an important aid in the diagnosis of AIDS dementia complex and contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder.\r"

Acceptance and quality control testing procedures have not emphasized the variability in center of rotation (COR) measurements caused by collimators and the need to verify uniformity across the full collimator field of view (FOV). Variation from the mean COR across the FOV was tested in four different collimators using multiple point source acquisitions. The mean COR was different for each collimator and two of the four had a greater than 0.5 pixel difference from the mean COR on some area of the FOV. This variation makes these collimators unacceptable for SPECT acquisition. Thus, initial acceptance testing of SPECT collimators should verify a uniform COR across the full FOV and collimators with a variability from the mean COR greater than 0.5 pixels should be rejected.\r"

The focal region was investigated by imaging a point source placed at the expected focal point and along the central ray of the collimator in front of and behind the focal point. Technetium-99m point source sensitivities measured in air at 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm from the collimator surface are 4.2, 5.5, 7.3, and 10.5 cts.sec-1.microCi-1 when used with a single camera SPECT system. A commercially available parallel hole collimator, with similar resolution characteristics has a measured sensitivity of 3.3 cts.sec-1.microCi-1. Volume sensitivities of 9,780 and 4,945 (cts.sec-1)/(microCi.ml-1) were measured for the cone beam and parallel hole collimators, respectively, using a 17-cm-diameter spherical source. Reconstructed spatial resolution (FWHM) on the axis-of-rotation ranged between 10 and 11 mm for both collimators when the radius of rotation was equal to 15 cm. Using equal acquisition times SPECT images of phantoms scanned with the cone beam collimator were visually improved compared with images acquired using the parallel hole collimator. These results demonstrate that a factor of 2 improvement in volume sensitivity can be demonstrated with a cone beam collimator compared with a commercially available parallel hole collimator. Further improvements are possible using shorter focal lengths, astigmatic focusing, and larger field of view cameras.\r"

The tissue distributions of the two 14C-labeled methionines were similar except for liver tissue. Similar distribution patterns were observed in vivo by PET using 11C-labeled methionines. The highest 14C incorporation rate into the protein-bound fraction was found in the liver followed by tumor, brain, and pancreas. The incorporation rates in liver and pancreas were different for the two methionines. By chloroform-methanol fractionation of these four tissues, in liver significantly different amounts of 14C were observed in macromolecules. Also in brain tissue slight differences were found. By HPLC analyses of the protein-free fractions of plasma, tumor, and brain tissue at 60 min after injection, for both methionines several 14C-labeled metabolites in different amounts, were detected. About half of the 14C-labeled material in the protein-free fraction was found to be methionine. In these three tissues the amount of nonprotein metabolites and [14C]bicarbonate amount ranged from 10% to 17% and 12% to 15% for L-[1-14C]methionine and L-[methyl-14C]methionine, respectively. From these results it can be concluded that the minor metabolic pathways have to be investigated in order to quantitatively model the protein synthesis by PET.\r"

Computed tomography showed a 4-cm right adrenal mass which was hypointense on the T1-weighted images and mildly hyperintense on the T2-weighted images of a magnetic resonance (MR) scan. At surgery, a coincidental benign adrenocortical adenoma was found. Because 67Ga uptake is usually associated with inflammatory or malignant lesions and malignant adrenal lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, these findings contributed to diagnostic uncertainty in this patient. Thus, a nonhyperfunctional adrenocortical adenoma may be associated with abnormal 67Ga uptake and atypical MR findings.\r"

Body and lymphoid organ weights were altered in the groups that received copper at 0.5 or 1 mg/kg. Males were more severely affected than females. A dose-related reduction in splenic T-cell subpopulations was noted in the 0.5 and 1 mg/kg groups. Responses to lipopolysaccharide challenge were reduced, and an increase in spontaneous cycling cells was noted in the groups receiving copper at 0.5 or 1 mg/kg. Only the group receiving copper at 0.5 mg/kg had increased stem cell activity; this increase was probably due to increased erythropoiesis to meet increased demands for red blood cells in this group. These data indicate that only groups receiving copper at 0.5 or 1 mg/kg in the diet were depleted and marginally depleted in copper, respectively, and that immune hyporesponsiveness differs between the depleted and marginally depleted groups.\r"

For each patient 18 to 59 months old, up to three 18- to 59-month-old controls were chosen from the same day care classroom. Using conditional logistic regression, the vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 45% (95% confidence interval = -1% to 70%) and did not change significantly after accounting for potential biases. In addition, three (3%) of 104 patients vs five (2%) of 207 controls were vaccinated within seven days before the patients' dates of admission (odds ratio = 1.8, 95% confidence interval = 0.3 to 10.2), which does not suggest an increased risk of Hib disease in the week following immunization. This study suggests that the efficacy of the currently used HBPV is less than expected from previous studies and points out the usefulness of case-control studies for monitoring vaccine efficacy following licensure.\r"

Seventy-six children 24 to 72 months of age who had H influenzae type b isolated from normally sterile sites from August 1985 through July 1987 were enrolled. For each case two controls, matched by age and place of residence, were randomly selected from the records of all live births in the area. Antecedent receipt of the Haemophilus b polysaccharide vaccine was ascertained from the records of all physicians and clinics at which the subjects received medical care. Overall, 12% of the cases and 39% of the controls had received the vaccine. The estimate of the protective efficacy of the vaccine was 88% overall (95% confidence interval, 74% to 96%) and 91% (95% confidence interval, 71% to 99%), 92% (95% confidence interval, 76% to 99%), and 81% (95% confidence interval, 45% to 96%) in Connecticut, Dallas County, and greater Pittsburgh, respectively. The estimates were not substantially affected by adjusting with logistic regression for differences between the cases and controls in race and the attendance of group day care. We conclude that the Haemophilus b polysaccharide vaccine is highly effective in these areas among children who receive the vaccine when they are 24 months of age or older.\r"

All six case-patients had personal contact with at least one other case-patient. Among the 46 nursing home residents, men were more likely than women to become ill (44% vs 0%). This cluster of disease suggests that elderly adults may be more susceptible to H influenzae infection than is generally recognized and that outbreaks among adults may result from person-to-person transmission.\r"

Specific therapy for this disorder is available in the form of weekly intravenous infusions of human plasma alpha 1AT, which effectively reconstitute the anti-elastase screen of the lung in these individuals. In an attempt to reduce the frequency of therapy we evaluated the ability of monthly infusions of alpha 1AT to provide equivalent lower respiratory tract protection against neutrophil elastase. Intravenous infusion of 250 mg/kg of alpha 1AT at 28-day intervals to nine individuals with alpha 1AT deficiency and emphysema was carried out for 12 months. Serum alpha 1AT levels exceeded the protective threshold for an average of 25 days after each dose of alpha 1AT was administered. Furthermore, the postinfusion level of alpha 1AT in the nadir lung epithelial lining fluid was fivefold greater than the preinfusion level, and the anti-neutrophil elastase capacity of the nadir epithelial lining fluid also was elevated significantly, nearly threefold above the preinfusion level. These results indicate that monthly administration of human alpha 1AT is fully capable of adequately augmenting serum and lung alpha 1AT levels and anti-elastase capacity and is therefore a rational alternative to weekly therapy.\r"

At sacrifice, -Zn animals had significantly lower (P less than 0.005) plasma zinc levels compared to controls. Nephrectomized (N) animals had significantly elevated plasma creatinine (P less than 0.005), diminished creatinine clearances (P less than 0.005), and increased urinary flows (P less than 0.005) and protein excretion (P less than 0.01) compared to sham-operated (S) controls. Zinc nutritional status had no effect on these parameters in animals with comparable renal function. -Zn/N animals had consistently significantly elevated (P less than 0.005) urinary zinc excretion compared with -Zn/S with similar plasma zinc concentrations. Urinary zinc excretion correlated with urinary flow (r = 0.739, P less than 0.005), urinary protein (r = 0.635, P less than 0.01) and urinary calcium excretion (r = 0.855, P less than 0.005) in -Zn groups. -Zn/N rats had a significantly larger fecal zinc excretion for the first week post-nephrectomy, compared to -Zn/N controls (P less than 0.005).

Six mg/kg/day of cyclosporin A, given from the time of immunization, completely blocked the development of interstitial lesions and renal insufficiency. The administration of cyclosporin A after the development of interstitial nephritis also arrested the progression of the histological lesions. Both T cell-mediated and humoral immunity were markedly reduced by the administration of cyclosporin A, as evidenced by the near absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses and by the reduced production of anti-tubular basement membrane antibodies. Cell admixture experiments indicated that impairment of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to tubular antigen was probably not the result of active suppression, and suggested that the protective effect of cyclosporin A might be secondary to its direct inhibitory action on the activation of nephritogenic T and B cells. Finally, the treatment of control rats with cyclosporin A, in the doses used, did not produce any detectable kidney damage nor did it impair renal function. We conclude that cyclosporin A can be an effective prophylactic and therapeutic agent in autoimmune interstitial nephritis in rats.\r"

Clinical neurologists have long been aware that knowledge of particular classes or categories of information may be selectively impaired in some cases and selectively spared in others. For example knowledge of letters, colours, objects, or people may be lost as a consequence of damage to the left hemisphere of the brain. Recently there has been quantitative evidence for even more specific impairment and preservation of particular classes of knowledge. More recently the evidence for knowledge of living things as compared with inanimate objects is particularly striking. Such observations have suggested that our semantic knowledge base is categorical in its organization. In this preliminary report, we describe a patient whose semantic knowledge deficit was not only category specific, but also modality specific. Although his knowledge of the visual world was almost entirely normal, his knowledge of living things (but not objects!) was gravely impaired when assessed in the verbal domain. These findings call into question the widely accepted view that the brain has a single all-purpose meaning store.\r"

  ".W": "AIDS is a disorder characterized by a slow progressive impairment of immune function and by infection of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2). Our knowledge of how these viruses cause disease in man, or how the related lentiviruses (visna and equine infectious anaemia virus) cause disease in animals, is still fragmentary. In particular, the significance of genetic variation in HIV-1, occurring within populations, within individuals and over periods of time, and the mechanisms of viral persistence remain unclear. To address these issues we prepared a series of proviral clones of HIV-1 originating from a single patient and compared their biological properties. Here we show that hybrid genomes (in which the envelope region of six viral clones were separately substituted into a prototype HIV-1 genome) generated viruses with widely differing capacity to grow in human T cells, cell lines and monocytoid cultures. These data suggest that extensive biological variation exists in vivo within an infected individual and is in part determined at the level of the viral envelope.\r"

We have determined the sequence of the N-terminal amino acids of perforin purified from a mouse natural killer cell line, and, by using oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the amino acid residues, we have identified a complementary DNA encoding perforin from the cDNA library of a mouse cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone. As predicted from the functional similarities between perforin and the ninth component of the serum cytolytic system, complement (C9) (refs 4-8), the deduced primary structure of perforin has homology with C9 at their respective functionally conserved regions. We find that perforin is only expressed in killer cell lines, and not in helper T lymphocytes or other tumour cells tested. Thus we have provided direct molecular evidence that a killer-cell-specific protein evolutionally linked to C9 is involved in cell-mediated cytolysis.\r"

In most species, activated T cells express class II molecules; however, no evidence has been found that these cells can present soluble antigens. This failure may be due to the inefficient capture, processing or display of antigens in a stimulatory form by T-cells. The capture of a soluble antigen, which is achieved by nonspecific mechanisms in macrophages and dendritic cells, can be up to 10(3) times more efficient in the presence of surface receptors, such as surface immunoglobulin on B cells that specifically bind antigen with high affinity. We asked whether T cells would be able to present soluble antigens that bind to their own surface molecules. Here we show that such antigens can be effectively processed and presented by both CD4+- and CD8+-bearing human T cells. This indicates that T cells are fully capable of processing and displaying antigens and are mainly limited in antigen presentation by their inefficiency at antigen capture.\r"

  ".W": "As T cells develop in the thymus, they become tolerant of self-antigens. A major advance in the understanding of how this process occurs was the direct demonstration that cells bearing autoreactive T-cell receptors (TCRs) are physically eliminated from the population of functionally mature T cells present in both the thymus and periphery. We have sought to determine the developmental stage at which autoreactive T cells are eliminated by examining the expression of V beta 17a anti-I-E TCRs under various experimental conditions. In vivo antibody blockage of the CD4 molecule on developing thymocytes of I-E+ C57BR mice was found to inhibit the deletion of V beta 17a-bearing cells from the CD4-8+ single positive thymocyte subset. This result provides strong evidence that deletion of potentially autoreactive T cells occurs at a CD4+8+ precursor stage, that the non-clonally distributed accessory molecules (CD4, CD8) are significant participants in the self-recognition process that leads to clonal elimination, and that thymic class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules can influence the repertoire of CD4-8+ cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic and helper T lymphocytes recognize foreign antigen in the form of short peptides associated with class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, respectively. A recent study of the three-dimensional structure of a class I MHC molecule revealed a cleft formed by the amino-terminal half of the protein, which could serve as the binding site for these peptides. Because an individual possesses only a limited set of different MHC molecules, each molecule of this set must have the ability to bind a large number of different peptides in order to ensure full immunocompetence. Thus, it can be anticipated that peptides with unrelated sequences compete for binding to the same MHC molecule, and, indeed, this has been shown to occur in vitro. We therefore decided to see whether such competition could also regulate the cell responses in vivo. We have found that a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 46-62 of mouse lysozyme, although not immunogenic itself, effectively inhibits the priming for T-cell responses when injected into mice together with foreign protein or peptide antigens. The inhibition observed strictly correlates with the capacity of the competitor to bind to the particular MHC molecule presenting the foreign antigen, and its extent depends on the molar ratio between antigen and competitor.\r"

  ".U": "88302466\r", 
  ".W": "T lymphocytes can be activated in a variety of ways, including occupancy of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex or cross-linking of certain cell-surface molecules with antibody. Two of the earliest events seen after stimulation are the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to inositol trisphosphate (Ins P3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), and an increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Later, the cell secretes lymphokines and expresses lymphokine receptors. It has been postulated that the products of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositols (Ptd Ins) and fluctuations in [Ca2+]i are critical 'second messengers', transmitting the signals for the initiation of the later events. We have examined the relationship between these second messengers and the secretion of IL-2 in a murine T cell variant whose missing TCR complex had been reconstituted by gene transfer. Surprisingly, although the IL-2 responses of the transfectant could not be distinguished from the original line expressing the same TCR, Ptd Ins hydrolysis and the increase in [Ca2+]i were substantially reduced or absent in the reconstituted cell. It is therefore possible to dissociate these early biochemical changes from a late biological response, raising questions about the putative causal relationship of these events.\r"

In BALB/c mice infected intracorneally with herpes simplex virus type 1, corneal opacity was manifested 10 days after infection, while in athymic mice corneas remained almost clear. Histologically, all opaque corneas revealed stromal edema accompanied by the diffuse presence of polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes. When complement (C')-treated immune spleen cells were adoptively transferred into athymic mice 6 or 72 h after corneal infection, stromal keratitis with mild opacity was observed 10 days after transfer. The athymic mice given anti-Thy 1.2+C'-treated immune spleen cells failed to develop corneal opacity. The difference, as revealed by light and electron microscopy, was the presence or absence of lymphocytic infiltration and edema in the posterior third layers of the stroma and endothelial lesions. The endothelium was infiltrated by lymphocytes or macrophages and showed various stages of destruction. The main cause of corneal opacity in the early stage of herpetic stromal keratitis is thought to be stromal edema due to an adverse effect on the endothelium by immune T lymphocytes.\r"

Exclusively in this area of contact there was a typical lens-induced inflammatory reaction.

In order to test the suitability of simultaneous administration of PRP-D and other vaccines we administered it to 25 infants mixed with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine at 3, 4 and 6 months and simultaneously, but in a separate syringe, with inactivated polio vaccine at 12 months. A comparison group of equal size received only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and inactivated poliovirus vaccines. The concentration of postvaccination antibodies to diphtheria toxoid was 0.411 IU/ml in the group that received PRP-D vs. 0.352 IU/ml in the comparison group, to tetanus toxoid 3.666 vs. 3.668 IU/ml and the neutralization titer to poliovirus type 1 was 370 vs. 320 units in the comparison group, to type 2 titer values were 230 vs. 270 units and to type 3, respectively, 210 vs. 290 units. Thus the seroresponse to antigens in routine vaccines was not affected by the presence of PRP-D in the vaccination schedule, and PRP-D can safely and effectively be included in the vaccination schedule of infancy.\r"

Protozoal infestation was found in 46% (potentially pathogenic protozoa in 20%) in Burao and 37% (potentially pathogenic protozoa in 17%) in Kismayo. In contrast a major difference between the two towns was observed with helminthic infection. In Burao only 6% of the specimens showed worm eggs or larvae, whereas in Kismayo the prevalence was 84% (P less than 0.001). The difference in helminthic infection rates might be explained by the different climatic factors, different population densities or habits of the people. Among 14 detected parasitoses the following five were found with an overall frequency of 10% or greater: trichuriasis (45%); entamebiasis coli (23%); ascariasis (17%); giardiasis (16%); and ancylostomiasis (15%).\r"

All three children had clinical signs of focal mass lesions and progressive neurologic deficits. In one child the deterioration was extremely rapid. New lesions appeared on serial CT scans every few days, simulating an infectious process and leading to death within 3 weeks. Results of neuroradiologic studies in these patients demonstrated multicentric lesions that were often periventricular. On CT scans, the lesions were hyperdense before contrast and were enhanced with contrast medium. Double-dose delayed contrast CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies were more sensitive in indicating additional lesions. Histologically, all three tumors were B cell neoplasms; two lymphomas were large cell type, whereas one was small cell, noncleaved (Burkitt-like). Primary CNS lymphoma occurred with an incidence of 1/26 (4%) in our autopsy series and 3/100 (3%) of all pediatric cases of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 infection, living and dead, that have been seen at the Children's Hospital of New Jersey. By comparison, opportunistic and reactivated latent CNS infections were less common in this same population and never appeared clinically as mass lesions. Therefore, in our experience, primary lymphoma is the most common cause of focal or multifocal mass lesions in the brains of children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. This tumor may be radiosensitive. In most cases, early biopsy is probably necessary to establish the diagnosis.\r"

Lewis rats (RT1l) were the recipients of syngeneic nerve grafts from identical Lewis donors or allogeneic nerve grafts from ACI (RT1a) donors. Nerve grafts were inlaid next to the intact sciatic nerve of the recipient. The immunologic responsiveness of the recipient animal's lymphocytes to a donor-specific antigenic challenge was assessed by the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). In addition, nerve grafts were evaluated histologically. Animals were monitored for cyclosporin A toxicity. It was found that cyclosporin A (5 mg/kg per day) was effective in rendering the recipient animals unresponsive by mixed lymphocyte reaction at 10, 20, and 40 days after engraftment. This dosage was similarly effective in preventing histologic changes characteristic of nerve allograft rejection. This dosage regimen was nontoxic to the animals. Our study ascertained a minimal nontoxic dosage of cyclosporin A that effectively prevented nerve allograft rejection across a major histocompatibility disparity in rats.\r"

The normalized circumferential count profiles of the short-axis sections that included the papillary muscles showed the same basic pattern as that on echocardiograms.

These two lesions were reliably distinguished from each other on the basis of MR findings. Choroidal hematomas appeared as lenticular-shaped masses in the wall of the eyeball, and signal intensity depended on the age of the hematoma. Choroidal effusions appeared as crescentic or ring-shaped areas of increased signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images in an anatomic distribution corresponding to the choroidal and suprachoroidal spaces.\r"

Of 29 patent internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts, 11 (38%) were damaged during mobilization of the left ventricle. At reoperations performed more than a year after the initial operation, increased graft blood flow compared with the first operation was observed in IMA but not in vein grafts. There were six early deaths (6%). The 5-year survival rate, inclusive of early mortality, was 90%. After a median of 2.5 years, 82% of the patients reported symptomatic improvement and 22% were completely free from angina, but full physical fitness was restored in only 3%. Excluding the patients of retirement age, 35% were able to resume work after the reoperation. Coronary artery reoperation should be considered only for patients with severe angina, because of the increased surgical risk and the lower likelihood of completely relieved symptoms. Presence of a patent IMA graft necessitates special caution.\r"

In exercise tests all nine denied chest pain, the limiting symptom being dyspnea. Chest radiograms were normal in these nine cases, and spirometry was largely unchanged from the preoperative findings (normal in 3 cases). Exercise tolerance was normal or near normal in six patients. The other three underwent pulmonary scintigraphy and cardiac catheterization at rest and during supine exercise. The scintigrams revealed no pulmonary emboli. Catheterization showed hypokinesis and raised pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise in all three patients. The cause of the left myocardial failure was not established. Long-term evaluation of CABS should take into account both effort angina and effort dyspnea.\r"

Effect of albumin administration on erythrocyte crenation was examined in 18 patients undergoing coronary bypass operation: 9 patients were given 25 g and another 9 patients were given 50 g of human albumin as a part of the priming solution. Erythrocyte crenation was almost completely prevented in the patients given 50 g albumin. Crenated erythrocytes during EC were 3.6 +/- 2.3% (mean +/- SD) of all erythrocytes and 2.8 +/- 3.7% after EC. This was significantly lower than in patients without albumin administration (63.4 +/- 34.0% during EC and 28.6 +/- 33.3% after EC, n = 20). But the effect was less striking in the patients given 25 g albumin, 32.4 +/- 39.1% during and 28.3 +/- 40.8% after EC. Maintaining an adequate level of plasma albumin is important in preventing erythrocyte crenation during EC, improving microcirculatory flow in patients undergoing open heart surgery.\r"

At the end of CPB a substantial preservation of water and energy metabolic indexes was found; a condition of extracellular metabolic acidosis was apparently sustained by muscle cell anaerobic glycolysis enhancement with a consequent increase of both muscle and plasma lactate content. Subnormal cell phosphocreatine levels as well as reduced bicarbonate buffer stores and decreased intracellular pH, were detected. Direct limiting effects of hypothermia on tissue O2 delivery and muscle oxidative metabolism as well as vasoconstriction and arteriovenous shunting associated with CPB procedures are likely to be involved in the above mentioned alterations of cell metabolism.\r"

An oscillating pattern of transient increases and decreases in total platelet ATP was observed following the sternotomy until the end of the operation. A highly significant increase in platelet ATP (20% +/- 14 of the pre-anaesthesia values) occurred during the first 24 h after surgery. Total platelet ADP however, did not show this oscillation nor was there any significant release of ADP from the platelets during ECC. Following collagen activation, increased amounts of 'releaseable ATP' were found after protaminization (124% +/- 38 of pre-anaesthesia values) (p less than 0.05), although whole blood aggregability was slightly reduced (89% +/- 18 of pre-anaesthesia values). This study indicates that 1) the metabolic ATP pool of circulating platelets underwent rapid changes during open heart surgery; 2) the majority of platelets did not release inert ADP during ECC; 3) there may be a compensatory enhancement of platelet function by other blood cells, which could explain the discrepancy between our aggregatory results in whole blood and those reported in platelet rich plasma (PRP) aggregometry.\r"

The mechanism of gene transfer is insensitive to deoxyribonuclease, requires contact, and possibly, areas of fusion of the cell membranes; it shares properties with the transfer by protoplast fusion in Gram-positive bacteria. The extensive degenerative evolution of mollicutes has retained, in S. citri, bacterial functions of chromosomal transfer and recombination.\r"

When using a cross-sectional technique, a decrease of cases being treated was seen after the introduction of a conventional screening program--thus indicating a change in the natural history of moderate scoliosis. This could, however, be explained by the consequence of an accumulation of treated cases, formerly diagnosed and treated later on, seen immediately after the introduction of screening. When the longitudinal method was used, this trend could not be observed. And finally, when taking changes of indication of treatment and of the population into consideration, no tendency at all toward a change in the natural history could be seen.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven patients with unilateral diaphragm paralysis of recent onset were studied to investigate the effect of the paralysis on inspiratory muscle function. Nine of the patients had noticed a decrease in exercise tolerance, which was not explained by any other pathological condition. Hemidiaphragm dysfunction was confirmed by the demonstration of a greatly reduced or absent transdiaphragmatic pressure on stimulation of the phrenic nerve in the neck, by means of surface bipolar electrodes (unilateral twitch Pdi), compared with normal values on the contralateral side. Transdiaphragmatic pressure was 44.6% (9.4%) predicted during a maximal sniff and 30.3% (16.8%) predicted during a maximal static inspiration against a closed airway, confirming diaphragm weakness. Maximum static inspiratory mouth pressures were also low (61.7% (12.7%) predicted), consistent with a reduction in inspiratory muscle capacity. Phrenic nerve conduction time was prolonged on the affected side in nine patients, consistent with phrenic nerve dysfunction, whereas on the unaffected side it was normal. It is concluded that recent hemidiaphragm paralysis causes a reduction in transdiaphragmatic pressure that is associated with a reduction in maximum inspiratory mouth pressure. Phrenic nerve stimulation is a useful technique with which to confirm and quantify hemidiaphragm dysfunction. Measurement of phrenic nerve conduction time provides useful information about the underlying pathology.\r"

A base-ring tilt of 7 degrees or more for aortic prostheses or 11 degrees or more for mitral prostheses was associated with an increased incidence of significant perivalvular regurgitation. Likewise, in patients who had multiple studies, a change between studies in base-ring tilt of 4 degrees or more for aortic prostheses or 5 degrees or more for mitral prostheses was associated with significant perivalvular regurgitation. These data suggest that the presence of either an abnormal base-ring tilt or an abnormal increase in base-ring tilt is strong, supportive evidence of partial prosthetic valve dehiscence.\r"

In mice that have received a single radiation dose of 1300 rad (13 Gy) (250 kVp) to the abdomen, relatively diminished uptake of perfluorooctylbromide emulsion in the spleen is seen as few as 12 days after irradiation when using 19F MR. When a GE NMR CSI 2-T spectroscopy/imaging system was used, 19F MR images were obtained in 2-16 min, and the postirradiation changes in the spleen were shown. This approach is the first that allows detection of acute postirradiation damage in the spleen in as few as 12 days and potentially allows assessment of macrophage dysfunction in vivo.\r"

The CT appearance of the small pyogenic abscesses was compared with that of 10 patients who had either fungal or mycobacterial abscesses and with that of 50 patients who had hepatic metastases. In all five patients who had small pyogenic abscesses, the abscesses appeared to cluster, or aggregate, in a pattern that suggested the beginning of coalescence into a single, larger abscess cavity (cluster sign). This cluster appearance was not seen in in any of the patients who had fungal or mycobacterial microabscesses. It was present in only one of the patients who had confirmed hepatic metastasis. Despite the small size of the abscesses, guided needle aspiration was successful in recovering pyogenic organisms in four of the five patients. In our experience, the presence of the cluster sign suggests that the lesions are pyogenic abscesses.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of 184 pancreatic biopsies in 178 patients was performed to assess the prevalence of severe postbiopsy pancreatitis. The size, contour, and pathology of the lesions biopsied; the course of the needle (i.e., through bowel or other viscera); the size of the needle; the number of needle passes made; and the guidance technique used were analyzed. Severe pancreatitis developed in five cases (five patients) 5/184 or 3% of the biopsies), usually within 24-48 hr. Three of the five patients who developed pancreatitis had true-negative biopsies (normal pancreas) proved either at surgery (two) or at clinical follow-up (one). The diagnoses for the two remaining patients were adenocarcinomas. In four of the five patients, the diagnosis of severe pancreatitis was made by inspection at surgery. The fifth case was diagnosed by CT. Three patients who underwent surgery and one patient who had percutaneous drainage recovered from the pancreatitis. The fifth patient died despite surgical intervention. All five patients with pancreatitis had masses 3 cm or smaller as compared with the overall group, in which 71 (39%) of the 184 biopsies performed had masses smaller than 3 cm. Overall, 18% of the biopsies were true negative, compared with the 60% true-negative rate in the pancreatitis group. The bowel was transgressed in 21% of all 178 patients, including three of the five pancreatitis patients. We conclude that although the risk of pancreatitis is exceedingly small in percutaneous needle biopsies, it may occur, and at a higher rate than previously reported.\r"

No one has yet reported an improvement in vertebral bone mineral concentration after parathyroidectomy. Quantitative CT was used to measure mineralization of lumbar vertebral bodies in five women with primary hyperparathyroidism, at the time of surgical resection of a parathyroid adenoma and again 4 months after surgery. Four of the patients had increased vertebral mineralization after 4 months; the increase for the entire group (13%) was statistically significant. In one patient, examined for a third time 8 months after surgery, a continuing increase in vertebral bone mineral concentration was seen. A final examination, obtained 20-33 months after surgery, revealed that in every patient the bone mineral concentration was lower than on the first postoperative study and in some cases was less than the original preoperative measurement. We conclude that a temporary increase in vertebral trabecular mineralization occurs after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. During the following 3 years, however, this increase is not sustained.\r"

  ".W": "MR imaging was performed on 36 formalin-fixed brain specimens. For three of these specimens, in vivo MR studies had also been performed before death. Changes that take place in the MR appearance of the brain after fixation are discussed. Gross and microscopic pathology revealed 14 lacunar infarctions in seven cases and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces (etat crible) in four. Both types of lesion were seen in specimens from predominantly elderly, hypertensive patients. Eight lacunae were in the deep gray-matter nuclei (four in the putamen with variable involvement of the internal capsule and caudate nuclei, two in the thalami, and two in the dentate nuclei), five were in the supratentorial white matter, and one was in the brainstem. Enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces were identified in the basal ganglia. All lesions were detected on MR. CT failed to disclose the brainstem and dentate lacunae and the enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. On MR, all lacunae were slitlike or ovoid, except one that was round. They were less than 1 cm in greatest diameter in all but two cases. The lacunae were hyperintense relative to brain parenchyma on both long TR sequences (short and long TEs) in all cases except that of a chronic infarct that underwent cystic change and was isointense relative to CSF on all pulse sequences. In contrast, dilated Virchow-Robin spaces were isointense relative to CSF in vivo or to fluid in the subarachnoid space in the postmortem state on all pulse sequences in all four cases. They were round or linear, and in general were smaller than the lacunae, although some overlap in size did occur. They were seen at the level immediately above the bifurcation of the internal carotid into the middle and anterior cerebral arteries and were seen on successive axial sections in the putamen (most prominent along its lateral margin) and in the internal capsule. MR studies of gross and microscopic pathology of lacunae and dilated Virchow-Robin spaces are useful in correlating MR and pathologic findings. However, changes resulting from the fixation process must be considered when postmortem and in vivo MR findings are correlated.\r"

  ".W": "MR was performed on 23 formalin-fixed brain specimens of patients 60 years old or older at the time of death. In two of these subjects MR had also been performed in vivo prior to death. Fifteen hyperintense white-matter foci were found on long TR MR images in seven brains. These lesions were correlated with gross and microscopic pathology. Six lesions were infarctions, two were small foci of gliosis or noncavitated infarcts, two were plaques of demyelination, one was a minute brain cyst, and one was a congenital diverticulum of the lateral ventricle; in three foci the abnormality was not found. We identified no MR criteria to distinguish noncystic infarction from either gliosis or demyelination. However, MR was able to distinguish all these lesions from fluid-containing spaces-including cystic infarction, brain cyst, and ventricular diverticulum-since the lesions in the latter group may be isointense relative to CSF in vivo or to fluid in the subarachnoid space in the postmortem fixed state on all pulse sequences. The relationship of a ventricular diverticulum and a brain cyst to the ventricle or subarachnoid space serves as an additional differentiating feature on MR. In cases in which CT was also performed, it revealed corresponding hypodensities in two infarctions, but failed to reveal the foci of gliosis (or noncavital infarction), demyelination, or brain cyst. These data suggest that subtle changes of gliosis and demyelination, presumably from chronic vascular insufficiency, and/or frank infarction account for the majority of hyperintense white-matter lesions seen in MR in elderly patients. Distinguishing among the various lesions is difficult, but subtle differences are present when MR is correlated with histopathology.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen chordomas and nine chondrosarcomas of the clivus were evaluated with CT and MR either before (22 cases) or after (three cases) treatment with proton beam irradiation. The ability of these imaging techniques to provide information necessary to direct patient treatment was studied. The tumor was detected and its gross margins were identified by both techniques in all instances. No reliable diagnostic features allowing differentiation between these two tumors were encountered. MR generally was superior in defining the exact position of the brainstem and optic chiasm relative to the tumor, and it frequently provided superior information about tumor extension into the nasopharynx and cavernous sinus. CT was always better than MR in demonstrating tumoral calcification and in defining the exact anatomy of bone destruction. MR was generally superior to CT in demonstrating the position of the cavernous internal carotid artery relative to the tumor and often provided superior visualization of the vertebral and basilar arteries. In cases in which bone-induced artifact obscured the interface between the neural axis and tumor in the CT image, or in which the tumor had suprasellar extension and was likely to compress the optic chiasm and tracts, MR was of great value in planning irradiation therapy. The high occurrence of clinically asymptomatic signal intensity alterations in the MR studies of previously treated patients appears to limit the differential diagnostic value of this information. Given its greater availability and lower cost, CT appears to be the technique of choice for routine follow-up of previously treated patients.\r"

The tumors consisted of two trigeminal schwannomas, five meningiomas, one lipoma, and three epidermoid tumors. The trigeminal schwannomas had homogeneously decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Three of the five meningiomas had signal intensity similar to that of surrounding brain on both T1- and T2-weighted images. One meningioma had decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The other had relatively low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images owing to heavy calcification demonstrated on CT. The lipoma had homogeneous signal intensity that was isointense with orbital and subcutaneous fat on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The epidermoid tumors had decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and markedly increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In addition, the epidermoids had an insinuating growth pattern and minimal mass effect. The extent of involvement in the trigeminal nerve distribution was well demonstrated in each case. Because of its multiplanar capability, exquisite anatomic detail, and characteristic tissue signal intensity, we conclude that MR is helpful in the differential diagnosis of primary tumors of the trigeminal nerve and Meckel's cave and in the evaluation of tumor involvement for preoperative planning.\r"

Intracranial abnormalities were noted on CT in 56% of cases and included abnormal enhancement of subarachnoid space and ventricular walls, ventricular dilatation, obliteration of cortical sulci, and enhancing nodules within the subarachnoid cisterns and lumen of the lateral ventricles. Although the degree of ventricular enlargement and intraventricular tumor deposits were equally well seen on CT and MR, involvement of ventricular walls, tentorium, subarachnoid cisterns, or subarachnoid space interpreted as abnormal enhancement on CT was not readily appreciated on routine T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences. Forty-four percent of CT and 65% of MR studies were interpreted as normal. There was high correlation of myelographic findings with clinical diagnosis, and no false-negative myelograms. Nodular filling defects within the subarachnoid space, thickening and crowding of roots of the cauda equina, irregularity of individual roots, and scalloping of the subarachnoid membranes were demonstrated. MR was rather insensitive in detecting these changes, revealing a definite abnormality of the subarachnoid space in 27% of patients with positive myelograms. False-negative interpretation of MR of the spine was made in 44% of cases.\r"

Ten (71%) of 14 patients with venous arterial grafts were successfully treated vs only six (38%) of 16 patients with prosthetic arterial grafts. These results suggest that streptokinase is an effective fibrinolytic agent for the treatment of arterial occlusion and arterial graft occlusion. Its effectiveness in arterial graft obstruction is comparatively low, although patients with venous grafts respond much more favorably than those with synthetic conduits.\r"

In two patients, the stenoses were extremely firm with a persistent waist noted in the maximally inflated balloon. One of these patients was left with a residual 40-50% stenosis after initial angioplasty, and a second attempt at dilatation after restenosis was also unsuccessful. This patient's blood pressure did not improve. When the results of our experience in these five patients were combined with 22 cases reported in the literature, we found that 23 (85%) of the 27 patients with focal renal artery stenoses caused by fibromuscular dysplasia had a decrease in blood pressure after percutaneous dilatation. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is an effective treatment for patients with renovascular hypertension caused by focal renal artery stenoses resulting from fibromuscular dysplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Dopexamine hydrochloride, a dopamine analog with specific beta 2 adrenergic and DA1 dopaminergic receptor activity, was evaluated in a prospective study including 20 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Shortly after admission to the intensive care unit, increasing doses of dopexamine hydrochloride (1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 10.0 micrograms/kg/min) were administered as continuous infusion at 20-minute intervals. Hemodynamic monitoring revealed that dopexamine hydrochloride causes a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a significant increase in cardiac output and heart rate, even at lower dose levels (1.0 micrograms/kg/min). At higher dose levels (greater than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/kg/min), adverse effects such as systolic hypertension and tachycardia were observed. Shunt fraction increased significantly during dopexamine hydrochloride administration, probably due to the increase in cardiac output. It is concluded that dopexamine hydrochloride is a potent vasodilating agent at lower dose levels and is of potential benefit to patients with compromised myocardial function after coronary artery bypass grafting. Higher dose levels may cause unwanted side effects, which might be explained by various mechanisms such as norepinephrine uptake inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities of coagulation are common in patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, although the mechanisms involved are unclear, except in a few cases. To investigate the pathogenesis of this coagulopathy, suspensions of purified leukemic cells were prepared and tested for procoagulant activity. Neither the leukemic cells nor their supernatants directly accelerated the clotting of plasma. Since the leukemic cells did not possess direct procoagulant activity, their ability or inability to elaborate a mediator of cellular coagulant properties, interleukin-1, was studied. Leukemic cells from patients with coagulopathy elaborated interleukin-1, and addition of phytohemagglutinin increased interleukin-1 release. In contrast, no interleukin-1 was released, before or after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, from leukemic cells from patients without coagulopathy. Leukemic cells from another group of patients with abnormalities of coagulation released interleukin-1 only after phytohemagglutinin treatment. In terms of the coagulation mechanism, interleukin-1 containing supernatants from leukemic cell cultures induced the procoagulant receptor tissue factor, a co-factor in the initiation of coagulation, on the endothelial cell surface. There was coordinate suppression of the anticoagulant endothelial cell receptor thrombomodulin, a co-factor for the antithrombotic protein C pathway. Antibody to interleukin-1 prevented these changes in cellular coagulant properties. Taken together, these changes result in a shift in the balance of endothelial cell coagulant properties to an activated state in which mechanisms promoting procoagulant reactions on the vessel surface predominate. Synthesis and release of the mediator interleukin-1 by leukemic cells thus defines a new mechanism through which malignant cells can potentially activate the coagulation mechanism.\r"

There were no significant differences for the presence of any presenting clinical or laboratory feature for patients who achieved a complete remission compared with those who did not. A complete response to therapy, younger age, higher presenting hemoglobin level, and absence of central nervous system bleeding favorably influenced overall survival. Therapy was ineffective in this age group, with only 12 patients (30%) achieving a permanent complete remission. Fourteen patients (35%) died either from bleeding or from direct complications of therapy. This analysis of ITP in the older adult suggests a disease refractory to therapy that is associated with major morbidity and mortality.\r"

Specifically, types 16 and 18, which are commonly grouped together, were analyzed separately and compared. Biopsies obtained from three different geographic sites in the United States and Brazil were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and correlated with the histologic diagnosis from the same tissue sample. There was a highly significant correlation between papillomavirus type and histologic grade comparing all grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with invasive cancer (p less than 0.001). Of particular interest was the striking deficit of type 18 in intraepithelial neoplasia (3%) as compared with invasive carcinoma (22%; p less than 0.001). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the distribution of type 16 in intraepithelial neoplasia (37%) as compared with invasive carcinoma (41%). The deficit of type 18 in intraepithelial neoplasia compared with invasive carcinoma could represent a rapid transit time through the precursor stage. Human papillomavirus type 18 may therefore play a role in the development of rapidly progressive cervical cancer.\r"

Anaesthesia was induced with morphine 0.1-0.15 mg/kg and thiopentone 3-5 mg/kg. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were facilitated with suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. A significant increase in blood pressure occurred during and after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the control group. This increase was absent in the patients pretreated with nifedipine. The nifedipine group also maintained a lower rate-pressure-product than the control group during the period of study. It is concluded that nifedipine 10 mg is a useful pretreatment to prevent the pressor response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

Impaired ventricular function was defined prospectively by left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% (group I, n = 12), and normal ventricular function by ejection fraction greater than 40% (group II, n = 22). Phenylephrine (Phe) pressor dose-response curves were established prior to anesthesia, during fentanyl anesthesia, and during fentanyl anesthesia plus hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass at the time of aortic cross-clamp (anes + CPB/AXC). Polynomial regression of the Phe dose response curve estimated the Phe dose required to increase mean arterial blood pressure 20%, designated PD20. Although pre-anesthesia PD20 and anes + CPB/AXC PD20 values were not affected by ejection fraction, significant differences in PD20 (P less than 0.05) between groups occurred during fentanyl anesthesia (group I = 2.28 +/- 1.60 micrograms.kg-1, group II 1.57 +/- 0.98 micrograms.kg-1; mean +/- SD). Anes + CPB/AXC was associated with a significant reduction in PD20 in both groups compared with pre-anesthesia (P less than 0.01). Our results suggest impairment of alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness occurs during fentanyl anesthesia in patients with ejection fractions less than or equal to 40% (evidenced by greater PD20 values). Although this impairment may be due to altered Phe pharmacokinetics, these results also support the possible existance of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor desensitization in this group. Reduction in PD20 during anes + CPB/AXC in all patients points to more powerful effects than fentanyl anesthesia alone; such influencing effects may include hemodilution, hypothermia, elevated plasma catecholamines, exclusion of the pulmonary circulation, or altered Phe pharmacokinetics.\r"

An arteriotomy and a phlebotomy were performed on several animals from each group. The pulmonary trunk, aorta, common carotid arteries, and external jugular veins were dissected and stained with silver nitrate to demonstrate calcification macroscopically. The first major bifurcation from 37 renal arteries from these animals was examined by the serial section technique to localize calcification about the arterial forks histologically. There was evidence that early calcification was flow related with a predilection for sites where atrophic lesions occur. Proliferative lesions in which matrix vesicles are abundant exhibited no such predisposition. It was concluded that matrix vesicles do not appear to be susceptible to vitamin D calcification. The topography of the experimental calcification differed from that of diet-induced lipid deposition.\r"

PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-two patients, \"the cases,\" had a terminal hospitalization and a peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage confirmed by hospital chart review. Population controls (n = 3897) were matched to potential cases by age, sex, race, calendar year, and nursing home status. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: \"Cases\" more frequently filled a prescription for an NSAID within 30 days before onset of illness than controls (34% compared with 11%; adjusted odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.1 to 7.2). This association between fatal ulcer disease and current NSAID use was consistent in three age groups, women and men, whites and nonwhites, and community and nursing home dwellers. There was no significant association between case status and previous NSAID use (adjusted odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.7 to 4.7).

Immunohistology showed that the tumor was infiltrated by T-lymphocytes, many of which were activated as judged by the expression of the following surface antigens: HLA-DR, transferrin receptor, and receptors for interleukin 2 (IL2). Fresh TILs were unable to lyse natural killer cell (NK)-resistant and NK-sensitive tumor cell targets in chromium-release cytotoxicity assays. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured in media containing natural IL-2. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes proliferated better than autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes and exhibited sustained growth and antitumor effector function in long-term cultures. The IL2-expanded culture of TILs contained mostly CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) T-lymphocytes with the morphology characteristic of lymphokine-activated killer cells. The ability to expand TILs with augmented antitumor activity in long-term cultures indicates that these cells could be therapeutically useful. Potential application of human TILs to adoptive immunotherapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is discussed, and recent advances in immunotherapy with IL2-activated TILs are reviewed.\r"

Eighteen volunteer subjects served as normal controls. Although some PCD neuropsychological test scores were abnormal, these results could not, in general, be dissociated from the effects of dysarthria and ataxia. rCMRGlc was reduced in patients with PCD (versus normal control subjects) in all regions except the brainstem. Analysis of patient and control rCMRGlc data using a mathematical model of regional metabolic interactions revealed two metabolic pattern descriptors, SSF1 and SSF2, which distinguished patients with PCD from normal control subjects; SSF2, which described a metabolic coupling between cerebellum, cuneus, and posterior temporal, lateral frontal, and paracentral cortex, correlated with quantitative indices of cerebellar dysfunction. Our inability to document substantial intellectual impairment in 7 of 10 patients with PCD contrasts with the 50% incidence of dementia in PCD reported by previous investigators. Widespread reductions in PCD rCMRGlc may result from the loss of cerebellar efferents to thalamus and forebrain structures, a \"reverse cerebellar diaschisis.\"\r"

PET studies revealed marked hypometabolism in the cerebellar hemispheres, cerebellar vermis, and brainstem of OPCA patients compared with 30 control subjects. With data normalized to the cerebral cortex, a significant inverse correlation was found between the severity of ataxia in speech and the lCMRGlc within the cerebellar vermis, cerebellar hemispheres, and brainstem, but not within the thalamus. No significant correlation was found between the severity of spasticity in speech and lCMRGlc in any of these structures.

  ".W": "Twelve spinal cord injured subjects participated in a study of the short-term effects on leg spasticity of electrical stimulation of the quadriceps. Spasticity was quantified through the use of a normalized relaxation index (R2n) obtained from the pendulum drop test both before and after measurement of isometric quadriceps torque in response to 20 minutes of cyclic electrical stimulation. Two or three baseline evaluations were made on each subject, tests being at least one day apart. By comparing the first prestimulus baseline assessment of spasticity with that obtained poststimulus, we obtained a measure of changes in spasticity brought about by fatiguing exercise. We found that spasticity significantly (p less than or equal to 0.005) decreased after stimulation. To investigate whether this change was due to electrical stimulation or was a function of the performance of the drop test itself (ie, passive range of motion of the knees), drop-to-drop variability during the pendulum drop test both before and after stimulation was assessed. A comparison was made of the R2n value of the last drop before stimulation to that of the first drop afterward, to assess the direct effect of stimulation on spasticity. Spasticity decreased significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) during the leg ranging inherent in the drop test itself, particularly for subjects with shorter times postinjury. Spasticity also decreased significantly as a direct result of electrical stimulation. This latter change could be accounted for by an interaction of peak quadriceps torque and the initial measure of spasticity before stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although the major feature of SCLE is nonscarring, non-atrophy-producing lesions, scarring discoid lesions were observed in 21 patients. Thirty-six patients fulfilled criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus. Cytoplasmic antibodies were present in only 22 patients. However, in the group of 23 patients recently analyzed, 13 of 22 tested had anti-Ro (SS-A) and/or anti-La (SS-B). HLA-DR3 was present in 22 of 59 patients. Neither anti-Ro (SS-A) nor HLA-DR3 correlated with any clinical finding. Forty-seven patients have had continued activity of their disease, but in most patients, the disease has been controlled with sunscreens, topical and intralesional corticosteroids, and oral hydroxychloroquine. A broad spectrum of systemic lupus erythematosus-associated phenomena can occur in patients with SCLE. The disease is frequently easily controlled, and may become quiescent. This subset of lupus patients is less distinctive than has been previously suggested.\r"

To study synovial cell-T cell interactions in vitro, we established cultures of fibroblast-like synovial cells, and used these cells in a synovial cell-T cell binding assay. Using T cells at various stages of differentiation and activation, we found that human thymocytes and mitogen-activated peripheral blood T cells bound to fibroblast-like synovial cells, whereas fresh peripheral blood T cells did not. Moreover, activated T cells from inflammatory synovial tissue or from synovial fluid also bound to fibroblast-like synovial cells cultured in vivo. Antibodies against certain epitopes of the T cell CD2 (35.1) and synovial cell lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3) (TS2/9) molecules inhibited synovial cell-thymocyte binding. However, these same anti-CD2 and anti-LFA-3 antibodies only partially inhibited synovial cell binding to activated normal peripheral blood T cells. Moreover, T cells from inflammatory synovium from rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients also bound to synovial cells in vitro. These findings demonstrate that fibroblast-like synovial cells are capable of binding to human T cells in vitro, and suggest that during the course of inflammatory synovitis, synovial fibroblast-T cell interactions may occur in vivo.\r"

DP plus CuSO4 inhibited both basal and interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induced tritiated thymidine incorporation into fibroblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Significant inhibition was observed at the level of 60 microM in the presence of 4 microM CuSO4. At this range of concentrations, which is attained in serum and in tissues of treated patients, DP alone or CuSO4 alone did not affect fibroblast proliferation. Similar inhibition was observed with various thiols in the presence of copper, but not with disulfides such as DP disulfide or oxidized glutathione. Inhibition of fibroblast DNA synthesis induced by DP and CuSO4 was reversed by the simultaneous addition of catalase or horseradish peroxidase, but not by boiled catalase or superoxide dismutase. The inhibition by DP and CuSO4, therefore, may be attributable to hydrogen peroxide produced by these 2 agents. DP, in the presence of CuSO4, did not affect IL-1 secretion from human peripheral mononuclear phagocytes. These observations indicate that hydrogen peroxide produced by DP plus CuSO4 inhibits IL-1-induced fibroblast proliferation by directly affecting fibroblasts, without alteration of IL-1 secretion from mononuclear phagocytes. Thus, DP may play a role in inhibiting the growth of rheumatoid pannus and excessive collagenation in scleroderma by direct inhibition of fibroblast proliferation.\r"

We report now that N-acetylprocainamide, a procainamide derivative that does not induce lupus, is also a DNA methylation inhibitor, but it is 100 times less potent than procainamide in inducing T cell autoreactivity.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of coronary artery surgery on left ventricular performance were assessed serially by echocardiography and treadmill exercise testing in 54 patients. Patients were assessed one day before operation and again before patients left hospital (mean 10 days after operation) and one month and six months after operation. At the predischarge assessment, 41 (77%) patients showed new abnormalities of left ventricular segmental wall movement, chiefly anteroseptal hypokinesia with hyperkinesia of the posterolateral segment. Although there were no significant changes in anteroseptal wall thickening after operation, there was a significant increase in posterior wall thickening at all postoperative assessments. The frequency of this abnormality decreased progressively after operation; it persisted in 19 (35%) patients at six months. Left ventricular fractional shortening decreased after operation and at one month was significantly less than before operation. There were no significant changes in left ventricular diastolic diameter during the study. Haemodynamic function during exercise, the duration of exercise, and features of reversible myocardial ischaemia all improved progressively and significantly after coronary artery surgery. Abnormalities in left ventricular segmental wall movement and thickening commonly develop early after coronary artery surgery but tend to resolve by six months and do not seem to impair left ventricular contractility at rest or exercise performance and haemodynamic function. Recognition of these echocardiographic changes may be clinically important in the assessment of patients after cardiac surgery.\r"

Seventeen patients (46%) presented with one or more opportunistic infections, mostly Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Eighteen patients (49%) had lymphadenopathy syndrome according to the definition of the CDC. Using the Laubenstein-classification of Kaposi's sarcoma, all patients either remained stable or deteriorated, improvement was never observed. Absolute T4 lymphocyte counts and the T4/T8 ratio were not related to the disease stage. With the onset of B symptoms (systemic symptoms), however, the absolute T4 numbers and the T4/T8 ratio markedly decreased. Delayed type hypersensitivity also showed no relationship to the clinical stages of Kaposi's sarcoma. Thus, the clinical progression of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions seems to be largely independent of the immunological parameters investigated. However, the onset of B symptoms was observed to be related to changes in immune status.\r"

We found no significant association between the frequency of either vasculitis or any autoantibodies and the presence of neurological disease, but did confirm a significant association between vasculitis and the presence of antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens. We therefore question whether severe and relapsing neurological disease is common in patients with Sjogren's syndrome.\r"

There is a pronounced female excess, with a ratio of 6:1, this excess being particularly marked in those under 45. It is difficult to assess the completeness of notification and thus the estimates should be considered as minimum. There are, however, suggestions in these data that the completeness of recording was high.\r"

No correlation was found between current intake of calcium and either total calcium in the body or the density of trabecular or cortical bone in the forearm or vertebral trabecular bone. Dietary intake of calcium did not influence the rate of postmenopausal bone loss in the 54 women who completed 12 months of active or placebo treatment. Even when extremes of calcium intake were examined no difference was found in bone measurements between the women with the highest and lowest intakes. The results of this study suggest that the bone density of women in the early menopause is not influenced by current dietary intake of calcium.\r"

Three of these patients also had features compatible with the postpericardiotomy syndrome (fever, malaise, or pleuritic chest pain), and seven developed the syndrome without pain in the shoulder girdle. Of these 10 patients, one had generalised myalgia. Postpericardiotomy rheumatism alone was not associated with increased inflammation (measured by the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and concentration of C reactive protein); immunological tests including measurement of antibodies to cardiac muscle yielded inconclusive results. Replies to a postal questionnaire showed that symptoms of postpericardiotomy rheumatism were present for over three months in 18 patients and for six months or longer in 14. In view of the large number of patients now having open heart surgery postpericardiotomy rheumatism should be considered when patients report pain around the shoulders so that it is not misdiagnosed as angina.\r"

Whether such treatment is valuable is open to question because of the lack of clinical and physiological studies. The physiological effects of synthetic oxytocin on plasma concentrations of oxytocin and events during delivery were assessed. Plasma oxytocin concentration was determined in serial samples during the late second stage and throughout the third stage of labour in 25 women. Ten women received combined ergotamine and synthetic oxytocin intramuscularly and 15 were not treated. The geometric mean plasma oxytocin concentration significantly increased in the women given oxytocin when measured before and after delivery of the fetal anterior shoulder (3.1 (SD 2.0) pmol/l before and 15.9 (2.7) pmol/l after). Six of the women who did not receive treatment showed a significant increase in geometric mean plasma oxytocin concentration before and after delivery of the fetal shoulder (3.2 (2.0) pmol/l before and 6.4 (2.0) pmol/l after) and nine did not show an increase (geometric mean 2.4 (3.1) pmol/l before and 2.2 (2.2) pmol/l after). Of these nine women, two had an abnormal third stage of delivery; one woman had a postpartum haemorrhage and one required manual removal of the placenta. As it is impossible to predict which women will show a rise in the plasma concentration of endogenous oxytocin, intramuscular oxytocin should be given routinely.\r"

The patient was subsequently managed with leucovorin and thymidine rescue. Simultaneous measurements before and after the hemodialysis-hemoperfusion apparatus and before and after the hemoperfusion device alone revealed a percent decrease in the concentration of d-leucovorin of 36% and 79%; 1-leucovorin, 82% and 75%; 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 52% and 64%; methotrexate, 73% and 37%; and 7-hydroxymethotrexate, 21% and 24%, respectively.

The hypermetabolic tumors tended to behave in a more malignant fashion. Patients with hypermetabolic tumors had a median survival of 7 months after PET scan, compared to 33 months for those with hypometabolic lesions. Among the high-grade glioma patients, the PET results separated them into a good prognosis group (hypometabolic, with 78% 1-year survival) and a poor prognosis group (hypermetabolic, with a 29% 1-year survival after PET). These results suggest that glucose metabolic studies may provide an independent measure of the aggressiveness of a brain tumor, and may supplement pathologic grading.\r"

To determine if oversized PTCA balloons would reduce the restenosis rate without increasing the risk of arterial dissection and acute complications, we prospectively randomized 336 patients to receive either smaller or larger balloons. Thirty-four percent of patients had multivessel disease and 18% had multisite dilatation. One hundred sixty-nine patients were randomized to PTCA with a larger balloon and 167 to PTCA with a smaller balloon. Balloon:artery diameter ratios were 1.13 +/- 0.14 in the larger group and 0.93 +/- 0.12 in the smaller group (p less than 0.001). The trial was halted as clinically important differences in acute complications emerged. Emergency bypass graft surgery, usually for the treatment of arterial dissection, was required in 7.1% of patients in the larger balloon group and 3.6% of patients in the smaller balloon group (p = 0.15). Myocardial infarction (Q wave and non-Q wave) complicated 7.7% of procedures in which large balloons were assigned and 3.0% of procedures in which small balloons were assigned (p = 0.056). There were no deaths in either group. The incidence of bypass surgery was 1.7% when the balloon:artery ratio was less than 0.9, 3.1% when the ratio was 0.9-1.1, and 7.8% when it was greater than 1.1. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that larger balloon assignment, multiple lesion dilatation, and multivessel coronary artery disease were independent predictors of emergency surgery. Angiographic restudy rates were 50% in the larger group and 60% in the smaller group (p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the feasibility of this method in humans, we studied 33 subjects (9 normal volunteers and 24 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease) at rest and after myocardial hyperemia induced with intravenous infusion of dipyridamole. At rest, the myocardial region demonstrating the lowest relative H2(15)O activity exhibited 71 +/- 8% of activity in the region with peak activity in control subjects and 62 +/- 17% in patients (p = NS). After the dipyridamole infusion, differences between the two groups were accentuated. In control subjects, activity in the region with lowest relative radioactivity averaged 77 +/- 5% of that in the region with peak activity. In patients, it averaged 55 +/- 22% of activity in the region with peak activity (p less than 0.01). Results in patients with ischemia with or without a history of remote myocardial infarction were not significantly different. In 22 of the 24 patients, the region with lowest relative perfusion corresponded anatomically to the region of myocardium distal to a stenosis. Thus, delineation of regional myocardial perfusion in patients with coronary artery disease is possible with positron emission tomography and H2(15)O. Further studies will be necessary to prospectively determine sensitivity and specificity.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective randomized trial, 468 patients with unstable angina pectoris who were stratified according to clinical presentation (Type I or Type II angina) and left ventricular function (normal or abnormal) were assigned to medical or surgical treatment groups. Left ventricular function was defined as abnormal if the ejection fraction was less than 0.50, or if the end-diastolic pressure was 16 mm Hg or greater. Left ventricular function was abnormal in 134 patients, 66 of whom were assigned to surgical and 68 to medical treatment groups. The cumulative 3-year mortality for surgical patients was 6.1% and for medical patients, 17.6% (p = 0.039). This 3-year figure represents a 65% reduction in mortality with surgery. Survival was significantly better for surgical patients whose ejection fractions ranged from 0.30 to 0.49 (p = 0.05). Survival of patients whose ejection fractions were greater than 0.69 was better with medical treatment (p = 0.049). Thus, surgery appears to be the treatment of choice for patients with unstable angina pectoris and abnormal left ventricular function.\r"

  ".U": "88311466\r", 
  ".W": "Coronary artery bypass grafting in pediatric patients provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of graft material. Twelve pediatric patients with severe coronary artery involvement secondary to Kawasaki disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with internal mammary artery and autologous saphenous vein grafts. Eleven patients were boys and one was a girl; their ages ranged from 5 to 13 years (mean age +/- SD, 8.7 +/- 3.0 years). These 12 patients had 17 internal mammary artery and 11 autologous saphenous vein grafts with a mean value of 2.3 +/- 0.7 grafts per patient. Five patients underwent bilateral internal mammary artery grafting with or without concomitant autologous saphenous vein grafting. There was no mortality, and all patients are leading almost normal lives, although strenuous exercise is still prohibited for some. Biplanar cineangiography was performed before and 1 month after (early postoperative period) coronary artery bypass grafting in all patients and was repeated more than 1 year after (late postoperative period) bypass in eight patients. Changes in graft diameter and graft length were assessed by computer-assisted graphic analysis of 10 internal mammary artery grafts and of seven saphenous vein grafts between the early and late postoperative periods. Patency rates of saphenous vein grafts and of internal mammary artery grafts were 91% and 100%, respectively, at the early postoperative period (p = NS), and 50% and 100%, respectively, at the late postoperative period (p less than 0.05). In addition to the excellent patency of internal mammary artery grafts in the late postoperative period, an in situ internal mammary artery graft was found to have grown 125% in length with 112% body growth (112% body surface area) (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) and to have enlarged 149% in diameter when the native coronary stenosis was tight. In contrast, the lengths of saphenous vein grafts either failed to change or were slightly decreased at the late postoperative period (p = NS). Growth potential of the internal mammary artery graft provides a new demonstration of the viability and adaptability of this graft. We conclude that the internal mammary artery graft is a \"live\" conduit with potential for growth and adaptation. This growth potential may be the most important reason for its excellent long-term patency, which suggests that in situ internal mammary artery grafts are the graft of choice for pediatric coronary artery bypass grafting.\r"

Multivariate analysis of risk factors contributing to late thrombosis indicated that graft atherosclerosis and smoking after graft surgery played important roles. Univariate analysis also showed significantly higher ratios of serum total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol and of serum LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol in patients whose grafts were affected by late thrombosis. To prevent late thrombosis of saphenous vein aortocoronary grafts, it appears reasonable that decreasing the ratios of total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol and of LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, refraining from smoking, and controlling other risk factors for atherosclerosis should be advised.\r"

Progression occurred in 36% (97 of 268) of the arteries in medical patients, in 38% (35 of 93) of the ungrafted arteries in surgical patients, in 74% (72 of 97) of the arteries with patent grafts at 5 years, and in 63% (29 of 46) of the arteries with closed grafts. After adjustment for the vessel system and the severity of disease at baseline, the risk of progression was three to six times higher in grafted arteries than in ungrafted arteries (p less than 0.01). For grafted arteries, the risk of progression was twice as high in arteries with patent grafts compared with those with closed grafts (p = 0.14). The majority (78%) of the progression in grafted arteries was to 100% occlusion. Proximal and distal progression rates in arteries with patent grafts were 74% and 11%, respectively. In the majority of arteries with closed grafts that progressed, the site of progression could not be determined. Regardless of treatment, the risk of progression was two times higher in the right coronary artery than in the left anterior descending or circumflex arteries. Progression risk was also twice as high in arteries with moderate disease at baseline compared with those with minimal or severe disease.\r"

To examine this issue, we studied 710 patients with significant coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%). Of 301 patients treated surgically, 232 had bypass grafts; 17, left ventricular surgery; and 52, both procedures. At 3 years after treatment, unadjusted survival was 84% for surgical patients and 64% for medical patients. At baseline, medical patients had more left ventricular dysfunction than surgical patients, but surgical patients had more coronary artery disease and angina than medical patients. In Cox survival models, two invasive factors (ejection fraction and extent of coronary artery disease) and three noninvasive indexes (assessment of myocardial infarction, angina, and conduction disturbances) were the five best predictors of survival (p less than 0.001). After adjustment for these factors between the two treatment groups, overall surgical survival at 3 years after treatment was 86%, and medical survival was 68%. Long-term surgical survival benefits appeared greatest in patients with the most severe left ventricular dysfunction, most extensive coronary artery disease, and most severe anginal symptoms. We conclude that surgery provides significant survival benefits for coronary disease patients with left ventricular dysfunction; in general, the sicker the patient, the greater the benefit.\r"

Patients undergoing reoperation tended to be older but not significantly so (50.9 +/- 8.3 years vs. 57.5 +/- 9.7 years), had more left main coronary artery disease (p less than 0.001), and had more triple-vessel disease (p less than 0.001) than those undergoing the initial operation. There were no significant differences in sex, prior myocardial infarctions, or prevalence of abnormal ventriculograms between the two groups. The cumulative survival rate during a 10-year follow-up period after reoperation did not differ from the rate after the initial operations. There was less relief of angina in the first year after reoperation than after initial operation, but thereafter, the annual increases in recurrence of angina were similar. Although there were more myocardial infarctions after reoperation in the first 6 postoperative years, the cumulative incidence after 10 years did not differ between the two groups. We conclude that reoperation yields a similar survival benefit but produces less early relief of angina than initial operation.\r"

Two hundred twenty-five patients underwent urgent coronary artery bypass grafting from 1982 through 1986. One hundred sixty-two men and 63 women averaged 62 years of age (range, 35-87 years). Operative mortality was 5.3%. To assess the predictors of perioperative mortality, 16 variables were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Significant independent predictors of perioperative mortality were the presence of a transmural anterior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.0005) and the need for preoperative intra-aortic balloon pumping for angina or congestive heart failure (p = 0.009). All perioperative mortalities (12 patients) occurred in this subset (anterior myocardial infarction, intra-aortic balloon pumping, or both) that included 101 patients. The mean follow-up period was 27.8 months (range, 1-69 months). There were 11 late deaths, resulting in an actuarial survival of 92 +/- 2%, 91 +/- 2%, 88 +/- 2.6%, and 88 +/- 4% at 1,2,3, and 4 years, respectively. Ninety-six percent of survivors were assigned to New York Heart Association Class I or II for congestive heart failure, and 96% were assigned to Class I or II for angina. Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting can be performed in patients with unstable postinfarction angina with acceptable mortality, although a significant increase in risk exists for patients with preoperative transmural anterior myocardial infarction, intra-aortic balloon pumping, or both.\r"

However, the effects of age on morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing this procedure remain controversial. To analyze morbidity and mortality in septuagenarians undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass surgery, we compared the results in 685 septuagenarians with those in 3,142 patients under the age of 70 years, all of whom underwent this procedure from January 1981 to December 1986. A larger percentage of elderly patients had triple-vessel disease (89% vs. 71%), left main coronary artery obstruction (34% vs. 16%), and ejection fractions less than 45% (68% vs. 41%). A larger percentage of septuagenarians had perioperative myocardial infarction (8% vs. 2%), required prolonged ventilatory support (10% vs. 3%), and had major neurological complications (4% vs. 1%). Mortality rates were significantly higher in elderly patients (7% vs. 2%) but did not correlate with the severity of coronary artery disease, the anginal pattern, or the diminishment of ventricular function. Major causes of mortality were pulmonary failure, renal failure, or both, sepsis, and neurological complications. These data suggest that elderly patients have an increased risk of cardiac and noncardiac morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass surgery. Higher mortality rates in this age group appear attributable to noncardiac organ failure. Late follow-up studies failed to show any significant difference among patients based on age alone.\r"

Over the entire study period (1969-1984), surgical therapy was associated with improved survival compared with medical therapy whether or not adjustment was made for imbalances in baseline prognostic factors. When patients were categorized according to coronary anatomy and left ventricular function, patients with multivessel disease and poor left ventricular function had a greater long-term survival benefit with surgery than did patients with less coronary artery disease and better left ventricular function. When 5-year survival rates were examined as a function of operative risk, a direct relation was found between estimated operative risk and the medical-surgical survival difference. For patients with an operative risk of 1%, the expected 5-year mortality with surgical therapy was 3% versus 8% with medical therapy (an absolute survival difference at 5 years of 5%). In comparison, for patients with an operative risk of 5%, the expected 5-year mortality with surgery was 10% versus 23% with medical therapy (an absolute survival difference at 5 years of 13%). Over 50% of patients with significant coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization have an estimated operative mortality risk under 2.5%. These patients would be expected to have a small survival advantage treated surgically. As operative mortality rates are subjected to increasing public scrutiny, selection of low-risk patients will reduce the overall benefit of the operation to the population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Over a 6.5-year period beginning January 1, 1981, postinfarction mitral regurgitation was demonstrated ventriculographically in 2,343 (19%) of 11,748 patients having significant coronary artery disease defined at cardiac catheterization. Moderate or severe regurgitation was observed in 381 (3%), and among these patients, four treatment groups were defined: Group I (medical, n = 165), Group II (reperfusion, n = 63), Group III (coronary artery bypass only, n = 94), and Group IV (valve replacement or repair in addition to coronary bypass, n = 59). Multivariable regression analysis of survival data in the overall population and in specific treatment groups was performed with the Cox proportional hazards model. Defined and undefined selection biases precluded formal quantitative survival comparisons among some treatment groups; however, unadjusted and adjusted survival analysis for each group revealed several interesting concepts. First, increasing severity of mitral regurgitation had a progressively negative impact on survival prognosis regardless of treatment. Congestive heart failure, the number of associated disorders, acute presentation requiring cardiac care unit admission, diminished ejection fraction, increasing coronary obstruction, and advanced age all worsened prognosis (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To this end, the surgical results were reviewed for 1,148 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, with and without associated coronary artery bypass grafting, for aortic stenosis between January 1, 1975 and September 1, 1987. The overall death rate was 4.6%. The neurological event rate (stroke or reversible ischemic event) was 4.2%, the myocardial infarction rate was 3.5%, and 30.7% had a hospital stay in excess of 10 days. Mortality for isolated elective aortic valve replacement rose from 2.5% for patients under age 70 to 7.3% for those over age 70. Mortality for elective aortic valve replacement plus coronary bypass was 3.8% for patients under age 70 and 11.6% for patients over age 70. The neurological event rate rose from 3.0% to 8.4% and the prolonged length of stay from 28% to 42%. By stepwise logistic regression analysis, the predictors of in-hospital mortality were age and emergent surgery. Age was the only multivariate predictor of neurological events. The year of surgery and emergent status were the multivariate predictors of prolonged length of hospital stay. Aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis is a well-established technique with low neurological event rates and mortality, which may be predicted in advance. Newer techniques must be considered in light of data such as these.\r"

  ".W": "1. The objective of this study was to see whether another proliferative stimulus could modify the marked proliferative effect of human epidermal growth factor (urogastrone-epidermal growth factor, URO-EGF) on the gastrointestinal epithelium. 2. The response of the gastrointestinal tract to URO-EGF was investigated in rats maintained on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with or without 75% small bowel resection. 3. Continuous infusion of 60 micrograms of recombinant beta-urogastrone/day per rat increased proliferation in the stomach by over four times (P less than 0.01), doubled proliferation in the small intestine (P less than 0.001) and increased it by four and a half times in the colon (P less than 0.001) in the control group. No significant effect of urogastrone was observed in the stomach of the resected groups, but proliferation was also increased in the small intestine by one and a half times (P less than 0.001) and by nearly four times in the colon (P less than 0.001). 4. Two-way analysis of variance showed that resection had a significant effect (P less than 0.01) on proliferation below the anastomosis and in the ileum. However, the response of the ileum was only half that observed in orally fed rats, which confirms the importance of 'luminal nutrition' in the response to resection. 5. Intestinal resection in the TPN rat was associated with a small rise in plasma enteroglucagon levels, suggesting that this hormone may be implicated in the adaptive response of the small intestine to resection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It usually presents radiologically as diffuse bilateral infiltrates and histologically as a foamy, eosinophilic intra-alveolar exudate containing the organisms' cysts. We recently studied two rare cases of P carinii pneumonia presenting as pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray films in two patients with AIDS. The corresponding histologies were a combination of the usual intra-alveolar pattern, with an alveolar and interstitial granulomatous appearance. Pneumocystis carinii was present in both areas and was the only organism found in the tissues examined. A third case presented with the more common radiographic appearance but also had a granulomatous histology. We conclude that P carinii pneumonia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in immunocompromised patients and that pathologists should be aware of the possibility of a granulomatous reaction to this organism.\r"

  ".W": "The human calcitonin gene-related peptides I and II (CGRP I and CGRP II) are two neuropeptides that have been recognized throughout the gastrointestinal system including the stomach. The present study was undertaken to compare in healthy volunteers the effects of intravenous infusions of CGRP I and CGRP II (79 pmol/kg.h) on pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion to those of calcitonin (88 pmol/kg.h). Calcitonin gene-related peptide I did not inhibit basal or pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. However, CGRP II and calcitonin inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated acid responses by 20% and 28%, respectively (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01), whereas basal acid output was only reduced with calcitonin (p less than 0.05). These effects were recognized with low doses of pentagastrin, and absent with high doses suggesting competitive inhibition. Furthermore, step-doses of CGRP I and CGRP II (79-320 pmol/kg.h) were given intravenously on continuous pentagastrin stimulation and compared with calcitonin (88-352 pmol/kg.h). Calcitonin gene-related peptide II and calcitonin induced a dose-dependent decrease of acid output, whereas CGRP I was ineffective. The inhibitory effects of CGRP II and calcitonin are not due to increased gastric alkaline secretion or to somatostatin release, as neither peptide stimulated gastric bicarbonate secretion or induced an increase in circulating somatostatin. In conclusion, CGRP II, unlike CGRP I, inhibits gastric acid secretion in humans. Inhibitory effects of CGRP II and of calcitonin were comparable. The results imply that CGRP I and II, at the level of the stomach, have distinct biological properties in humans.\r"

The hemodynamic effects and the pharmacokinetics of the peptide were also assessed. Using the triple-lumen perfusion technique in unsedated restrained animals it was shown that the highest dose of the peptide stimulated a transient net jejunal water and electrolyte secretion, and induced diarrhea in 4 of 6 animals receiving it. The peptide also induced dose-dependent tachycardia, hypotension, and increases in plasma immunoreactive somatostatin. All three doses of calcitonin gene-related peptide produced plasma immunoreactive peptide levels within the elevated range previously measured in human patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Calcitonin gene-related peptide may have a major role in the pathogenesis of secretory diarrhea in medullary thyroid carcinoma.\r"

Reflectance spectrophotometry provides indices of mucosal hemoglobin concentration (IHB) and oxygen saturation (ISO2). Hyperemia (increased IHB, normal ISO2), ischemia without congestion (decreased IHB, decreased ISO2), and ischemia with congestion (increased IHB, decreased ISO2) are accompanied by characteristic patterns of IHB and ISO2. Under anesthesia, measurements were obtained on separate days from the gastric corpus mucosa of eight dogs before and 2 to 10 min after either 1 to 5 units of intravenous vasopressin or 1 mg of propranolol. Results revealed that vasopressin (in doses that significantly reduced variceal and portal venous pressure in this animal model) produced a reduction in both IHB and ISO2, indicating gastric mucosal ischemia secondary to splanchnic vasoconstriction. On the other hand, propranolol in a dose that significantly reduced pulse rate by 27 +/- 2% had no effect on IHB or ISO2, suggesting that this dose of propranolol has no direct vasoactive effect on the gastric (splanchnic) circulation.\r"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) from most healthy donors showed low, but significant levels of cytotoxicity for normal epithelial cell target cells of 8.7 (4.4) % (mean (SD] and similar levels were found in 14 ulcerative colitis (6.5 (4.4) %) and 16 Crohn's disease (6.2 (5.2) %) patients. Neither drug therapy nor disease activity influenced the results. The sensitivity of colonic epithelial cells isolated from inflamed and histologically normal mucosa to lysis by peripheral blood MNC from a single donor was not affected by the underlying disease. Anti-epithelial cell activity did not correlate with anti-K562 activity and the cytotoxic cell was plastic non-adherent and Leu-11b-. None of 15 MNC populations isolated from mucosa of normal, tumour bearing, or chronically inflamed intestine exhibited significant lysis of colonic epithelial cells despite killing of K562 target cells in 10. Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells, generated by interleukin-2 stimulation in vitro of nine intestinal and seven peripheral blood MNC populations, exhibited high levels of lysis of K562 cells but, on every occasion, failed to lyse colonic epithelial cells. These data indicate that spontaneously cytotoxic or LAK cells are unlikely to play a role in the generation of colonic epithelial cell injury by direct cytotoxicity in inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoid-suppressible aldosteronism (GSA) is a rare form of hyperaldosteronism in which the increased secretion of aldosterone and the elevation of blood pressure are corrected when ACTH secretion is suppressed. Two 17-hydroxylated analogs of 18-hydroxycorticosterone and aldosterone, 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol, which had been identified in the urine of patients with hyperaldosteronism due to an adrenal adenoma and in bullfrog adrenal tissue incubated with cortisol, are produced in greater than normal quantities in patients with GSA. The excretion of 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol in nine patients with GSA was 2914 +/- 923 (+/- SD) nmol/day [1108 +/- 351 micrograms/day; normal, 165 +/- 94 nmol/day (63 +/- 36 micrograms/day)] and 141 +/- 77 nmol/day [53 +/- 29 micrograms/day; normal, 3.2 +/- 2.4 nmol/day (1.2 +/- 0.9 micrograms/day)], respectively. The excretion of aldosterone 18-oxoglucuronide was 53 +/- 18 nmold/day [19.4 +/- 6.8 micrograms/day; normal, 16.9 +/- 7.5 nmol/day (6.1 +/- 2.7 micrograms/day)]. Aldosterone excretion was elevated in six patients and within the normal range in three patients. The degree of abnormality in 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol excretion was significantly greater than that in aldosterone. Dexamethasone administration decreased excretion of the three steroids to the normal range. ACTH administration for 3 days resulted in an exaggerated increase in the excretion of these steroids, suggesting ACTH dependence of these steroids in patients with GSA. The excessive production of these steroids, which are 17- and 18-hydroxylated, indicate that they are produced by hybrid-type cells which we have called transitional cells, which are also capable of producing aldosterone. These findings are consistent with the postulate that cytochrome P-450-corticosterone methyl oxidase fails to disappear normally in the zona glomerulosa cells as they migrate to the zona fasciculata and acquire 17-hydroxylase activity. This abnormality explains the supernormal conversion of cortisol to 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol and the ACTH dependence of aldosterone secretion in GSA.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the pathogenesis of humoral hypercalcemia associated with esophageal carcinoma in a 65-yr-old patient, clonal cell lines (EC-GI) were established from the tumor. The EC-GI cells produced bone-resorbing activity which eluted from a Sephadex G-75 column in a broad peak, with an apparent mol wt of 10,000-50,000. In addition to PTH-like factor(s), the EC-GI cells produced a factor with thymocyte proliferation-stimulating activity which had an apparent mol wt of 15,000-20,000. This interleukin-1 (IL-1)-like factor(s) with acidic pI (4.8 and 5.2) exactly coeluted with the bone-resorbing activity upon DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography. Both bone-resorbing and thymocyte proliferation-stimulating activities were completely inhibited by anti-IL-1 alpha antiserum, but not by anti-IL-1 beta antiserum. Northern blot hybridization studies revealed that EC-GI cells produced exclusively mRNA for IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, fractions containing IL-1-like activity and PTH-like activity synergistically stimulated bone resorption in vitro, and transplantation of EC-GI cells into nude mice caused hypercalcemia in vivo. These findings suggest that IL-1 alpha and PTH-like factor produced by this squamous cell carcinoma synergistically stimulate bone resorption and are related to humoral hypercalcemia in tumor-bearing nude mice and in the patient.\r"

  ".U": "88315739\r", 
  ".W": "Demonstration of C-like \"rings,\" lytic granules, and the Ca2+-dependent lytic proteins--perforin/cytolysin--thereof, in certain cytocidal lymphocytes has led to the hypothesis of a mechanism of lytic granule-exocytosis and a common terminal lytic step in lymphocyte and C-induced lysis. However, neither cytolytic granules, nor formation of C-like rings during lysis have been detected in mature, highly potent, peritoneal exudate CTL (PEL) derived directly from the site of allograft rejection or in cytocidal hybridomas derived from them (PEL hybridomas). We now report that when stimulated in vitro in the presence of Con A supernatant, as a source of T cell growth factors (TCGF) or rIL-2, small in vivo primed PEL transform into large, dividing cytolytic T cells (PEL blasts) that express the same lytic specificity of the original PEL in short term lytic assays. The PEL blasts, in contrast to PEL, possess massive quantities of lytic granules, and protease (N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester esterase) (BLT-esterase) activity as well as non-specific, cell-mediated cytolytic activity in a long term (4-h) assay. These results suggest that the proposed lytic mechanism involving exocytosis of lytic granules, perforin, and BLT-esterases and the formation of 10 to 20-nm lesions may apply to lysis induced by granule-containing effectors such as large granular lymphocytes and TCGF-dependent CTL lines, such as PEL blasts. However, killing by mature, in vivo primed CTL, such as PEL or their hybridomas, appears to be effected through an alternative, contact-induced, self-destruction process(es) of the target not involving secretory lytic granules or the above lesions. Hence, although the expression of lytic granules and BLT-esterase activities in cytolytic lymphocytes devoid of these components is induced by TCGF, these cellular constituents are not necessary for the expression of CTL-mediated target cell lysis by mature effector cells.\r"

We demonstrate that this monovalent, soluble MHC Ag is incapable of stimulating the release of IL-2 from this T cell hybridoma. However, the same preparation of the purified protein can elicit a dose-dependent response when made multivalent either by covalent coupling to soluble, high m.w. dextran or to agarose beads, or by adsorption to polystyrene tissue culture plates.\r"

Twice daily injections of 200 ng of IL-1 alpha or -beta for 4 days results in a 90% decrease in thymic cellularity, which regenerated after cessation of treatment. Study of thymocyte subpopulations revealed that the number of CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes was dramatically decreased in IL-1-treated mice. Functional assessment of the CD4-/CD8- population from treated animals showed that these cells had adequate mitogenic responses in vitro and that the proportion of these cells in cycle was not different from control CD4-/CD8- cells. IL-1 treatment also prevented the regeneration of thymic cellularity after irradiation. The use of strains of mice differing genetically at the Ly 1 locus to construct radiation bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that bone marrow-derived thymocyte precursors were able to seed the thymus in the IL-1-treated animals. Again, however, the CD4+/CD8+ thymocyte population was significantly decreased. Thymic repopulation occurred upon cessation of IL-1 therapy. Finally, we determined that a single i.p. injection of IL-1 caused a three-fold increase in serum corticosterone levels, which peaked approximately 3 h after IL-1 administration. Thus, an IL-1-dependent increase in serum corticosterone levels may be responsible for the observed thymic hypoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The CD4+ helper/inducer T cell population is comprised of functionally distinct subsets identifiable by the HB11 (anti-CD45R) mAb. We have previously shown that the cells that provide help for antibody production express the CD4+CD45R- phenotype. In contrast, CD4+ CD45R+ cells have minimal, if any, helper cell functions; rather, these cells function as inducers of Ts cell activity. The lineal relationship of these phenotypically and functionally distinct CD4+ subsets is unknown. In the present studies, we have examined the hypothesis that the CD4+ subpopulations identifiable with anti-CD45R antibodies represent \"virgin\" or \"memory\" T cells sequentially derived from a common differentiation pathway but differing in their relative maturation. When freshly purified cells were tested, CD4+ CD45R+ cells had no Th cell function. However, after in vitro activation with PHA and propagation in IL-2, CD4+CD45R+ cells acquired the ability to provide help for antibody production. Moreover, this functional acquisition by these cells was accompanied by their conversion to the CD4+CD45R- phenotype. Analyses of the activation, growth kinetics, and functional dose-response characteristics of CD4+CD45R+ and CD4+CD45R- cells demonstrated that our findings did not result from the selective growth of CD4+ CD45R- cells contaminating the CD4+CD45R+ preparations. Thus, these data demonstrate that the \"helper\" and \"suppressor-inducer\" subsets of CD4+ cells identified by anti-CD45R antibodies are not comprised of fully mature, phenotypically and functionally stable T cells. Rather, these CD4+ subsets appear to represent cells at different maturational stages of an activation-dependent, post-thymic differentiation pathway.\r"

After dissociation of the gamma- and delta-chains of TCR by treatment with SDS, delta TCS1 specifically immunoprecipitated the delta-chain. This antibody bound to the surface of other gamma/delta-positive T cell lines and clones and was able to stimulate the proliferation of a minor cell population (0.9 to 4.0%) of resting human PBL. Upon binding to gamma/delta-TCR-bearing Molt-13 cells and PBL, delta TCS1 elicited a fura-2 Caa+ signal indicating that the gamma/delta-receptor is functionally similar to the alpha/beta-heterodimer. These data indicate that the delta TCS1 antibody recognizes an epitope on TCR delta-chain and its mitogenic activity should be useful in characterizing the functional properties of human gamma/delta-positive T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "A strong association between anti-SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La antibodies and skin lesions has been well documented in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and neonatal lupus erythematosis in which 70 to 80% of patients are female. In order to better understand the mechanisms of the influence of sex hormones on cutaneous lupus, we designed immunopathological in vitro experiments to evaluate the effects of estradiol and other sex steroids on the binding of SS-A/Ro- and SS-B/La-specific antibodies to cultured human keratinocytes from neonates. Cultured human keratinocytes incubated with antisera specific for SS-A/Ro or SS-B/La Ag were fixed with either acetone or paraformaldehyde and then analyzed in indirect immunofluorescent assays or by FACS analysis to detect cell surface IgG binding as an indirect measure of SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La Ag expression on the cell surface of keratinocytes. Estradiol (10(-5) to 10(-7) M) augmented binding of antiserum probes on the surface of cultured keratinocytes, with 10(-7) M estradiol showing the highest induction of cell surface binding of antisera specific for SS-A/Ro plus SS-B/La Ag (24.5% of cells were positive). In contrast, dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, and progesterone showed no augmentation. The augmentation by estradiol was partially inhibited by the antiestrogen nafoxidine. Estradiol augmented the relative incidence and absolute number of small or cuboidal cells binding antibodies specific for SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La Ag, whereas the number and incidence of larger differentiated cells binding anti-SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La decreased significantly in cell cultures stimulated with estradiol. Flow cytometric analysis utilizing monospecific anti-SS-A/Ro or anti-SS-B/La sera showed that estradiol induced binding of anti-SS-A/Ro in 13.1% of cultured keratinocytes, of anti-SS-A/La in 14.4%, and of sera specific for both Ag in 21.4%. This direct association between estradiol and the augmentation of binding to the cell surface of human keratinocytes of IgG from antisera specific for SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La Ag may be a trigger factor of immunologic damage in lupus and may be important in the different sex rates observed in skin manifestation of subacute cutaneous and neonatal lupus erythematosis.\r"

The ability of T cells from these animals to proliferate in vitro in response to whole guinea pig (GP) myelin basic protein (MBP), rat MBP, and to the major encephalitogenic peptide of GP MBP 66-88 (GP 68-88) was also assessed. We found that Lewis (Lew) was highly susceptible and showed good T cell responses to GP, MBP, rat MBP, and GP 68-88. Lew.1N (BN MHC on Lew background) and BN were not susceptible and T cells from these strains showed significant responses to GP MBP, but not to rat MBP or GP 68-88. Although BN.B1 (Lew MHC on BN background) was not susceptible to actively induced EAE, MBP-specific Lew T cells could transfer severe disease to BN.B1. BN.B1 T cells showed responses to GP-MBP, rat MBP, and GP 68-88 and, when transferred to naive BN.B1 or Lew, induced only mild clinical EAE in both strains. Increasing the number of T cells from BN.B1 had no effect on the severity of clinical symptoms in either recipient, suggesting some deficiency in the T cell repertoire that is necessary for induction of severe EAE. These results suggest that 1) the T cell response to rat MBP and GP68-88 (but not to sites other than 68-88 in GP MBP) is necessary for susceptibility to EAE; 2) the ability to respond to both rat MBP and GP 68-88 is determined by the MHC gene products on APC; and 3) given a permissive MHC, the T cell response that results in EAE is influenced by non-MHC genes.\r"

  ".W": "CD28 is an Ag of 44-kDa Mr that is expressed on the membrane of the majority of human T cells and that is recognized by mAb 9.3. The functional effects of mAb 9.3 on peripheral blood T cells were studied. mAb 9.3 was not mitogenic, unless it was combined with PMA. When CD28 was cross-linked after binding of mAb 9.3 to the T cell by immobilized or soluble anti-mouse IgG, T cells proliferated in response to rIL-2, provided that monocytes were also present. The additional signal required for IL-2 responsiveness after cross-linking of CD28 could also be delivered in cultures of purified T cells by a cellfree monocyte culture supernatant. Expression of IL-2R on about 10% of the T cells was demonstrated by staining with an anti-IL-2R mAb, and was found to be largely restricted to CD4+ cells. The active compound responsible for the helper signal in the monocyte culture supernatant was identified as IL-6 because purified IL-6 (but not IL-1 beta) had similar activity and because an antiserum to IL-6 (but not an antiserum to IL-1 beta) neutralized the activity of the monocyte supernatant and blocked T cell proliferation. An anti-IL-2R antibody also completely inhibited T cell proliferation induced by the combination of mAb 9.3, IL-2, and IL-6. Our results provide evidence that cross-linking of CD28 induces functional IL-2R and that this activity is dependent on a helper signal provided by monocytes, more specifically IL-6. Moreover, our results indicate that IL-6 (previously called B cell stimulatory factor-2) is active on T cells. If a natural ligand for CD28 can be identified, the mechanism of induction of IL-2 responsiveness described here might explain how T cells become nonspecifically involved in an ongoing cellular immune reaction.\r"

Mitogen (Con A) elicited MAggF production directly from T cells. Responses to Ag were Ag-specific, required syngeneic accessory cells in addition to T cells, and were independent of T cell fine specificity for azobenzenearsonate. Mouse MAggF shared a number of biochemical and immunochemical properties with the fibronectins (FN): 1) high Mr similar to that of plasma FN; 2) binding to gelatin, heparin, and polyclonal antibodies and mAb specific for cellular and plasma FN; 3) inhibition of activity in solution by monoclonal anti-human FN directed against plasma FN gelatin-binding domain; and 4) action on peritoneal exudate macrophages mediated through a FN-receptor cross reactive with one on human monocytes. MAggF production required active protein synthesis and was associated with significant increases in gelatin-binding immunoreactive FN (Mr 440 kDa on immunoblotting) in culture supernatants and T cell lysates. Metabolically labeled peptides could be precipitated by anti-FN from culture supernatants of activated T cells. Stimulated cultures contained significantly more cells with immunohistologically demonstrable cytoplasmic FN than unstimulated control cultures. We suggest that T cell FN is a distinct species of cellular FN which may play an important role in mediating delayed hypersensitivity inflammatory reactions in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of Reuber hepatoma cells (RHC) to 30 and 300 fM human rIL-1 (hurIL-1) for 4 h significantly decreased cytosolic glucocorticoid binding. Scatchard analysis indicated that the 30 and 300 fM doses of hurIL-1 significantly decreased the Bmax (maximum number of available binding sites), but did not alter the Kd (affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor for ligand). The decrease in cytosolic glucocorticoid binding, expressed relative to cytosol protein, did not result from increased intracellular protein in hurIL-1-treated RHC. In addition, the receptor binding reaction in RHC treated with 300 fM hurIL-1 could be resolved only by computer application of a three-parameter model. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis confirmed significantly less untransformed (8 to 10S) receptor-ligand complexes in hurIL-1-treated RHC, which is biologically significant because hurIL-1 (300 fM) also inhibited the glucocorticoid induction of the gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Altered transformation of the receptor-ligand complex, a possible mechanism of action for hurIL-1-mediated inhibition of PEPCK induction, was examined. However, receptor transformation, verified by in vitro activation by high salt (0.3 M KCl) of glucocorticoid receptor-ligand complexes and subsequent sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis, was not affected by hurIL-1. Furthermore, cytoplasmic glucocorticoid binding, determined in intact cell dexamethasone uptake experiments, was decreased in hurIL-1-treated RHC. The decrease in cytoplasmic glucocorticoid binding was reflected subsequently in decreased nuclear binding. The results support our hypothesis that, during acute infection and inflammation, mediators alter metabolic pathways in the liver by interfering with glucocorticoid action.\r"

Both T4-positive and T8-positive cells respond to IFN-beta 2/IL-6 plus PHA. Studies of the time requirements of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 and of PHA in the response of T cells show that optimal co-stimulation occurs when both IFN-beta 2/IL-6 and PHA are added together at the outset of culture, suggesting that IFN-beta 2/IL-6 acts predominantly on resting T cells. Unlike T cell proliferation induced by IL-2, T cell proliferation induced by IFN-beta 2/IL-6 is not blocked by antibodies to the IL-2 R, suggesting that IFN-beta 2/IL-6 does not act by stimulating IL-2 production. Thus, in addition to its previously reported properties, IFN-beta 2/IL-6 stimulates T cells in the presence of mitogen, and may prove to be of considerable importance in the physiologic activation of T cells.\r"

In contrast to its known effects in CD4+ T cell responses, IL-1 is not known to play a role in CD8+ T cell responses. In the present study, we have assessed the ability of murine recombinant IL-1 to function as a co-factor for stimulating CD8+ T cells to secrete lymphokines such as IL-2. We found that, in conjunction with either Ag or mitogen, IL-1 is able to stimulate lymphokine-secreting CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, we found that, as a consequence of its stimulation of lymphokine-secreting CD8+ T cells, IL-1 is able to reconstitute MHC class I allospecific cytolytic T lymphocyte responses by cell populations depleted of both accessory cells and CD4+ T cells. These results demonstrate that the biologic activity of IL-1 is not restricted to CD4+ cell responses, and suggests that IL-1 can function as a co-factor for the stimulation of lymphokine-secreting Th cells regardless of their CD4/CD8 phenotype. If IL1 acts directly on lymphokine-secreting T cells or on the APC with which they interact is not yet certain.\r"

All four mAb absorbed IL-5 activity from solution. Although all were able to neutralize mouse IL-5 bioactivity, two were significantly more effective. These two were also able to neutralize the activity of mouse IL-5 delivered to B cells during a cognate-linked interaction with a Th cell clone. A two-site sandwich ELISA specific for mouse IL-5 was developed by using pairs of mAb. The mouse IL-5 ELISA is capable of detecting natural or mouse rIL-5 in supernatants, crude bacterial lysates, and high concentrations of mouse serum, and has a detection limit of less than 20 pg. Two of these antibodies cross-reacted with and neutralized human rIL-5, and one of these was used for development of an ELISA for human IL-5.\r"

  ".W": "Glycoprotein (gp) 140, the EBV/C3dR of B lymphocytes, is a membrane site involved in human cell regulation. To analyze the specificities of the binding sites for EBV and for C3d on the gp 140 molecule, two distinct approaches were used. First, anti-EBV/C3dR mAb were prepared against highly purified EBV/C3dR. Nine anti-EBV/C3dR mAb were obtained. Four of these anti-EBV/C3dR mAb inhibited C3d binding but not EBV binding on gp 140, whereas four others exerted an inverse effect. These differences could not be due to differences in isotype, antibody concentration, affinity constant, and number of molecules bound on cell surface, as these parameters were identical for the nine used mAb. Second, polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were prepared against F(ab)'2 fragments of polyclonal anti-EBV/C3dR (Ab1). Ab2 recognized the variable portion of Ab1 as controlled by immunoblotting experiments. Ab2, which did not react with the cell surface, inhibited Ab1 binding on Raji cells. Ab2 mimicked the EBV/C3dR by its properties to bind to particle-bound C3d and EBV, preventing their binding on Raji cell surface. C3d binding specificities contained in Ab2 were isolated by affinity chromatography on C3b/C3bi-Sepharose. These specificities, being the internal image of C3d binding site of EBV/C3dR, reacted with Ab1 and inhibited particle-bound C3d binding on Raji cells but did not react with EBV. Taken together, these data support strongly that gp 140, the EBV/C3dR, carried two distinct binding sites, one for EBV and one for C3d.\r"

  ".W": "Somatic mutation in the Ig genes plays a major role in the increase of antibody affinity observed in secondary immunologic responses. It has been shown that the mechanism responsible for the high rate of somatic mutation in the Ig genes was active not only in normal B lymphocytes but also in B-cell hybridomas secreting mAb. Also, it has been reported that B-cell hybridomas were positive for membrane Ig of the same specificity as the secreted mAb. The presence of membrane Ig suggested that somatic variants secreting mAb of higher affinity could be selected by the increased capacity of these hybridoma cells to bind immobilized Ag. This hypothesis was tested with hybridoma cells secreting an IgM mAb reacting with the A Ag of the ABO blood group system. In two selection experiments, we have isolated several variant cell lines secreting mAb of increased avidity for the A Ag under similar IgM concentrations. Biochemical characterization of one of the variant mAb indicated that the mutation responsible for the increased avidity has occurred in the heavy chain gene. The method developed may have profound implications for the diagnostic and therapeutic use of mAb and will permit the study, in an in vitro system, of the role of somatic mutations in antibody diversity.\r"

However, treatment of the cells with the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, results in significant cytosolic alkalinization without detectable acidification, but did not affect the proliferative responses to mitogenic ligands and was a potent co-mitogen with non-mitogenic ligands. These data indicate that initial acidification or alkalinization responses are not essential for early activation or triggering of DNA synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "When thymocytes were cultured with adenosine, deoxyadenosine, or deoxyguanosine at 1 mM for 24 h, DNA cleavage at internucleosomal sites with multiples of approximately 180 bp was induced, followed by lactate dehydrogenase release into the medium. In the presence of coformycin, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, or formycin B, a purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor, DNA cleavage was induced by these nucleosides at concentrations of less than 50 microM. Other purine and pyrimidine ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides did not induce DNA cleavage or LDH release. Because thymocyte nuclei contain a Ca2+,Mg2+-dependent endonuclease, which preferentially cuts DNA in its linker regions, DNA fragmentation induced by the three purine nucleosides was suggested to occur through increased activity of the endonuclease. The DNA cleavage induced by the nucleosides required protein phosphorylation and synthesis, inasmuch as it was inhibited by an inhibitor of protein kinases, H-7, and by an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide. The inhibition of DNA cleavage was accompanied by a reduction in lactate dehydrogenase release, suggesting a causal relationship between DNA cleavage and cell death. The DNA cleavage and subsequent cell lysis might be related to the selective thymocyte deletion observed in patients with adenosine deaminase or purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency.\r"

Analysis of the participation of accessory cells in this phenomenon indicates that the ability of PGE to modulate CFU-GM MHC class II expression, the proportion of CFU-GM in S-phase of the cell cycle and the responsiveness of CFU-GM to inhibition in vitro by two negative growth regulators, acidic isoferritin inhibitory activity and PGE itself, requires the participation of CD8+ T lymphocytes. This effect is mediated by a lymphokine of m.w. 27,000 that we have purified to apparent homogeneity. This lymphokine possesses neither colony stimulatory nor inhibitory activity, is produced by both peripheral blood and bone marrow CD8+ T lymphocytes, as well as the CEM T-ALL cell line, and requires the obligatory presence of PGE for activity.\r"

  ".U": "88315776\r", 
  ".W": "The i.p. injection of mice with highly purified recombinant human rIL-1 alpha or beta resulted in the rapid influx of a large number of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) into the peritoneal cavity. Significant increases in the number of PMN were induced by doses of IL-1 which ranged from 0.005 to 5 ng/injection. Interestingly the dose response for PMN influx was bell-shaped because 50 ng of IL-1 did not result in a significant increase in peritoneal PMN. IL-1 induced PMN infiltration was detectable by 1 h with peak levels of PMN obtained by about 2 h, followed by a subsequent decline by 24 h. Other cytokines, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IFN alpha beta, granulocyte-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-3, TNF-alpha, and TNF-beta were compared to IL-1 for their ability to induce a PMN influx into the peritoneum. Only TNF-alpha or TNF-beta (lymphotoxin) were able to induce a significant influx of PMN within 2 h. However, based on total protein administered, about 100 times more TNF than IL-1 was required to produce a comparable PMN infiltration. Intraperitoneal injection of inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase pathways did not inhibit the IL-1-induced influx of PMN. Also, neither IL-1 nor TNF triggered an increase in PG or leukotriene release from peritoneal cells in vitro. Furthermore, direct peritoneal injection of leukotriene B4, a potent PMN chemoattractant in vitro, did not induce any significant increase in PMN in the peritoneal cavity indicating that chemotactic activity alone is insufficient for inducing peritoneal infiltration. These results suggest that the local production of very low levels of IL-1 in vivo would be sufficient to initiate a sequence of events that results in a rapid accumulation of PMN. Because IL-1 was not chemotactic for PMN in vitro, our data suggest that IL-1 induces production of factors that are chemotactic for PMN. Alternatively, IL-1 may act on other stages of the complex sequence of events that regulates the emigration of PMN into tissue sites in vivo. The synergy apparent in PMN influx when suboptimal concentrations of IL-1 and TNF were injected suggests that the local production of very low concentrations of these cytokines in situ could play a critical role in the emigration of PMN during infection.\r"

These cAMP-elevating agents also produced significant inhibitions of subsequent (48 to 72 h) Ig secretion by the same B cells as measured by a reverse hemolytic plaque assay and an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay for IgM (both p less than 0.001). PMA- and IBMX-treated cells were particularly responsive to the effects of cholera toxin, showing a doubling of cAMP content and profound decrease in Ig production (p less than 0.001). Because our previous studies had correlated activation of the metabolic turnover of the phosphatidylcholine (PC) fraction of membrane phospholipids with enhanced Ig secretion, we examined the sensitivity of PC metabolism to cAMP in control and PMA-stimulated cells. Formation of PC was found to be inhibited by forskolin and IBMX (both p less than 0.002) but breakdown of PC was stimulated (p less than 0.001). These findings imply that as the enzymatic products of PC, choline phosphate and diacylglycerol, are depleted due to the combined effects of cAMP upon synthesis and turnover of PC, there is a decrease in Ig secretion. Since diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C, it appears reasonable that Ig secretion is at least partially regulated by cAMP-responsive alterations in PC metabolism produced by protein kinase C-induced phosphorylation. We conclude that the early cAMP-sensitive changes in PC metabolism in this activated B cell line may signal for subsequent alterations in Ig secretion.\r"

Adjuvants tested included CFA, aluminum hydroxide (alum), a lipophilic derivative of muramyl tripeptide (MTP-PE), and a muramyl dipeptide (MDP) covalently conjugated to rgD1. Animals were immunized three times with rgD1 plus the various adjuvants and antibody titers were determined by ELISA. Four weeks after the last immunization, the animals were challenged intravaginally with HSV type 2 and were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease, including frequency and severity of herpetic lesions, incidence of urinary retention, and mortality during the 14-day post-challenge observation period. Animals immunized in the foot-pad with rgD1 formulated with CFA showed the highest antibody titers. Animals immunized in the footpad with rgD1 using MTP-PE in a 4% squalene formulation, alum, or rgD1 conjugated to MDP showed mean antibody titers that were 57, 16, and 13% of the CFA titers, respectively. Immunization with rgD1 plus MTP-PE, alum, or rgD1-MDP conjugate by the i.m. route elicited lower antibody titers than the footpad route of immunization. Results of the viral challenge indicated that clinical symptoms of the groups immunized with rgD1 with CFA or MTP-PE as adjuvant were similar in magnitude and were markedly reduced compared with unimmunized control groups. Animals immunized with rgD1 combined with alum or rgD1-MDP conjugate showed clinical symptoms significantly more severe than the CFA or MTP-PE groups. The protective immunity observed after i.m. immunization of animals with rgD1 and MTP-PE was only slightly lower than animals immunized with the same Ag-adjuvant combination in the footpad. The results indicate that MTP-PE is an effective adjuvant for the recombinant herpes gD vaccine.\r"

The sequences had the following features: 1) there was no clear sequence relationship between anti-DNA and anti-RNA antibodies; 2) there were no major similarities between any of the L chain sequences and each VL gene segment belonged to a different mouse VK subgroup; 3) the H chains of the two anti-RNA antibodies showed closely related sequences of VH gene segments and very similar third complementarity determining regions (CDR3); 4) the H chains of the two anti-DNA antibodies had VH segments belonging to different VH gene families but had a unique and similar combination of D segments and junctional sequences, suggesting a common recognition element for Ag and/or for idiotypic regulation in the H chain CDR3; and 5) the VH gene segment of one anti-DNA antibody (D42) was found to be very similar to the VH gene segment of a CBA mouse hybridoma antibody (6G6) which binds to the environmental Ag phosphocholine. The three-dimensional structure of the Fv-region of the anti-DNA antibody (D42) was modeled by computer and a stretch of poly(dT), ssDNA was docked to a cleft in the antibody combining site, formed by the three H chain CDR and by CDR1 and CDR3 of the L chain.

  ".W": "The regulation of expression of the TCR-alpha and -beta genes was studied in the human T cell tumor line Jurkat. Treatment of the cells with PMA was shown to decrease the surface expression of the TCR-alpha/beta/CD3 complex. Subsequent to PMA-induced modulation of the TCR/CD3 complex, increases in the mRNA levels of both the TCR-alpha and -beta genes were observed reaching a maximum 12 h after stimulation. Other T cell activators were also examined for their ability to increase TCR-alpha and -beta mRNA expression. Only agents that activate protein kinase C were shown to induce expression of the TCR-alpha and -beta genes. The observed increases in TCR-alpha and -beta gene mRNA levels were not the result of a uniquely derived Jurkat subline. Similar inductions of TCR-alpha and -beta mRNA levels were observed in an independently maintained Jurkat cell line. In both cell lines, elevations of TCR gene expression was accompanied by a decline in the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene. PMA induction of TCR-alpha and -beta mRNA was shown to occur in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The 1.6-kb TCR-alpha and the 1.0-kb D beta J beta C beta TCR-beta gene transcripts were fully induced in the presence of cycloheximide, whereas the 1.3-kb V beta D beta J beta C beta transcript was only partly induced in the presence of cycloheximide. Run-on transcription assays demonstrated that the increase in TCR-alpha and -beta mRNA levels could be entirely accounted for by increases in the transcription rate of both genes after PMA induction. Thus, in summary, protein kinase C stimulation leads to TCR-alpha/beta modulation in Jurkat cells and an increase in steady state TCR-alpha and -beta mRNA levels as a result of transcriptional activation of both genes.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocytes from mice bearing the weakly immunogenic MCA 105 sarcoma contained pre-effector cells that could be sensitized and expanded in vitro to acquire anti-tumor reactivity. The in vitro sensitization (IVS) required antigenic stimulation by tumor cells and the presence of IL-2 for cellular proliferation. Recent work has also demonstrated that IVS cells could be generated in an IL-2 concentration as low as 2 U/ml. In the present study, we have evaluated therapeutic efficacy of IVS cells generated in different concentrations of IL-2 against advanced metastases established in the lung as well as in the liver. Treatment of microscopic or grossly visible pulmonary metastases established for 3 or 10 days by systemic transfer of IVS cells resulted in significant reductions of the numbers of metastases. On a per cell basis, IVS cells generated in 2 U/ml of IL-2 exhibited at least twofold greater reactivity than cells generated in 1000 U/ml of IL-2. In survival experiments, treatment of established microscopic (day 3) and visible (day 10) pulmonary metastases with 1.5 x 10(7) and 3 x 10(7) IVS cells generated in 2 U/ml of IL-2 resulted in prolongation of survival and cure of the disease in 60 and 30% of animals, respectively. The systemic anti-tumor effect of IVS cells was further investigated in mice with hepatic metastases. Treatment of day 3 microscopic hepatic metastases revealed that as little as 1.2 X 10(7) IVS cells generated in 2 U/ml of IL-2 reduced the mean number of metastases from more than 250 in various control groups to 32. Evaluation by survival demonstrated that transfer of 1.7 x 10(7) and 3.8 x 10(7) IVS cells was capable of prolonging the survival and curing 40 and 30% of mice bearing day 3 and day 9 hepatic metastases, respectively. Again, IVS cells generated in 2 U/ml of IL-2 were more effective therapeutically than cells generated in 1000 U/ml of IL-2. In all experiments, mice were also given IL-2 to enhance the in vivo reactivity of IVS cells. However, the doses of IL-2 alone had no therapeutic benefit. Taken together, our results show that adoptive immunotherapy with IVS cells generated from tumor-bearing mice was an effective means of eliminating advanced metastases in various visceral organs.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to begin to dissect the mechanism whereby anti-asialo GM1 (alpha ASGM1) prevents otherwise lethal graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) across multiple minor histocompatibility barriers in mice. Phenotypic characterization of cells from the peak proliferative time of the graft-vs-host reaction (C57BL/6J lymph node cells----irradiated LP/J, days 5-7) revealed the alpha ASGM1 and alpha Thy 1.2 identified cells with an approximate 80% concordance and that NK-1.1 staining was negligible. Because resting T cells do not label with alpha ASGM1, the epitope recognized by alpha ASGM1 on GVHR T cells is an activation antigen. Because asialo GM1 has been previously found on the surface of activated macrophages, we wanted to distinguish between the two most likely targets for the in vivo effect of alpha ASGM1 infusions (T cells or macrophages). We compared the effects of alpha ASGM1 infusions on alloantigen-stimulated T-cell proliferation versus antigen presentation: T-cell proliferation was markedly reduced by alpha ASGM1 infusions, whereas antigen presentation function was not diminished. We conclude that the mechanism whereby alpha ASGM1 prevents GVHD does not involve NK cells or antigen presenting cells, but does involve activated donor T cells. The potential therapeutic advantage of such an antibody for use in human disorders compared to pan-immunosuppression lies in its ability to eliminate selectively those T cells involved in the immunologic process (i.e. activated T cells) while sparing the remainder of the T-cell repertoire.\r"

  ".U": "88315823\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a 25-kD protein which has regulatory activity over a variety of cell types. It is distinct from epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGF analogs, and exerts its action via a distinct receptor. Its effect on proliferation or differentiation can be positive or negative depending on the cell type and the presence of other growth factors. It also modulates the expression of cellular products. TGF-beta causes fibroblasts to increase their production of the extracellular matrix components, fibronectin and collagen. Human keratinocytes (HK) are known to have TGF-beta receptors. We wished to study the effect of TGF-beta on the production of extracellular matrix proteins by human keratinocytes in culture. Human keratinocytes were grown in serum-free defined medium (MCDB-153) to about 70% confluence. Following a 16-h incubation in medium lacking EGF and TGF-beta, cells were incubated for 12 h in medium containing varying concentrations of EGF and TGF-beta. Cells were then labeled with 35S-methionine for 10 h in the same conditions. Labeled proteins from the medium were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. TGF-beta at 10 ng/ml induced a sixfold increase in the secretion of fibronectin, as well as an unidentified 50-kD protein. Thrombospondin production was also increased, but not over a generalized twofold increase in the production of all other proteins. EGF, at 10 ng/ml, caused a smaller additive effect. TGF-beta may be an important stimulator of extracellular matrix production by human keratinocytes.\r"

  ".U": "88315853\r", 
  ".W": "The herpes simplex virus (HSV) recombinant R7017 was constructed from HSV-1 (strain F) by deleting a portion of the thymidine kinase (tk) gene and by replacing the sequences representing the internal inverted repeats and adjacent genes in the L component with a fragment of the HSV-2 genome encoding the glycoproteins G, D, I, and a portion of E. In addition, the R7020 recombinant contains an HSV-1 DNA fragment encoding the tk gene fused to the alpha 4 gene promoter. The results of studies in mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits were as follows: Both recombinants remained unchanged after nine serial, intracerebral passages in mice; the recombinants could not be differentiated with respect to attenuation in mice injected intracerebrally, in vaginally infected guinea pigs, and in rabbits inoculated on the scarified cornea. Given intradermally or intramuscularly, the recombinants prevented severe infections by virulent challenge viruses, and R7020 established latent infections (at a low frequency) in all species tested, whereas latent R7017 virus was detected in rabbits only.\r"

The attack rate in core antibody-negative men was 35.7%; this rate was 43.9% in antigen-positive men, 51.9% in men with low (less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L) CD4+ cell counts, 6.8% in core antibody-positive men, 6.9% in antigen-negative men, and 6.1% in men with normal CD4+ cell counts. The disappearance of core antibody, the expression of antigen, and the occurrence of low CD4+ cell counts preceded AIDS by a median of 624, 544, and 466 d, respectively. Seronegativity for core antibody preceded AIDS in 21 of 26 patients, 20 of whom were also antigen positive. Four more cases of AIDS developed among the antigen-negative, core antibody-positive men with low CD4+ cell counts. Only one patient with AIDS escaped detection by using these three markers.\r"

Test performance in detecting individual coronary artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50% demonstrated 100% sensitivity. Specificity was 100% for circumflex stenosis, 78% for right coronary stenosis, but only 10% for left anterior descending coronary stenosis. This very low specificity was due to the fact that 3/4 (75%) patients with left anterior descending stenosis and also 9/10 (90%) patients with normal left anterior descending coronary arteries had immediate septal perfusion defects with redistribution in all cases at 3 hr. Septal abnormalities were most marked in patients who achieved high peak heart rates (greater than 170 bpm). Thus, with LBBB, 201Tl SPECT is indeterminate for left anterior descending coronary disease.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular pressure-volume (P-V) loops provide a complete definition of cardiac performance but have been difficult to obtain in the clinical setting. Accordingly, we have developed a new technique for acquiring P-V loops during and after cardiac surgical procedures using portable first-pass radionuclide angiocardiography coupled with intraventricular micromanometer catheters. Using this technique 35 serial left ventricular P-V loops were acquired in 12 patients during and after coronary artery bypass grafting. Dynamic radionuclide left ventricular volume and micromanometer pressure were acquired simultaneously to generate the P-V loops. Moreover, simultaneous measurement of both volume and pressure allowed comparison of the timing of end diastole (ED) and end systole (ES) defined by each of the two cardiac parameters. For 208 EDs and 243 ESs analyzed volume-defined ED occurred 8 +/- 27 msec (s.d.) later in the cardiac cycle than pressure-defined ED while volume-defined ES occurred 29 +/- 27 msec (s.d.) earlier than pressure-defined ES. It is concluded that measurement of cardiac P-V loops with this new technique is clinically feasible and that a close agreement has been demonstrated between the timing of cardiac events defined either by volume or pressure criteria.\r"

In all patients transmission computed tomography (TCT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show focal brain abnormalities. Relative to normal subjects, AD patients showed significant reductions in cortical/cerebellar activity ratio: cortical perfusion was globally depressed with the largest reductions in frontal and posterior temporo-parietal cortices. Asymmetries of relative perfusion between cerebral hemispheres were also demonstrated when language was affected or visuospatial functions were unevenly impaired. In patients with early AD, SPECT provides functional information to be compared with clinical and psychometric data.\r"

  ".W": "This study was done to determine whether [99mTc]methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (RP30), a nonredistributing myocardial perfusion agent, could be used to quantify regional myocardial blood flow distribution during ischemia and reperfusion, employing sequential injections of tracer, tomographic imaging, and appropriate image subtraction. Dogs underwent transient (6 min) coronary artery occlusion, followed by two paired injections of RP30 and radioactive microspheres combined with tomographic imaging, the first during coronary occlusion and the second after 60 min of reperfusion. To obtain a true image representative of reperfusion, the first set of images was corrected for 99mTc decay and subtracted from the second. During occlusion, tissue microsphere content and scintigraphic RP30 activity in the center of the ischemic region (both expressed as a fraction of the nonischemic region) were closely correlated, although RP30 consistently exceeded microsphere content (0.43 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.01). Direct tissue counting of RP30 confirmed its relative excess in ischemic myocardium. Reperfusion was successful in 7/8 dogs, with an increase in RP30 activity to 0.98 +/- 0.04 compared to 0.89 +/- 0.03 for microspheres (p = N.S.). In one dog with microsphere-documented persistent ischemia, the RP30 defect was still present after reflow. Our results indicate that because of the lack of myocardial clearance and redistribution, repeat injections of RP30 can be used to quantify serial changes in regional myocardial blood flow.\r"
