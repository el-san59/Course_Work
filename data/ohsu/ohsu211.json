A normal C-terminal parathormone level helped distinguish this patient from patients with severe hypercalcemia due to primary hyperthyroidism. The ECG revealed a widened rather than a shortened QT interval, as well as a J wave, a broadened T wave, and a U wave with this marked hypercalcemia, all of which reverted to normal with correction of the hypercalcemia.\r"

The case illustrates the importance of obtaining a history of international travel, the need to consider \"exotic\" parasitic diseases in travelers returning from the tropics, and several of the presenting features of onchocerciasis. In the past, onchocerciasis was treated with diethylcarbamazine and suramin, both of which have appreciable toxicity. A major recent advance has been the introduction of ivermectin, which appears to be more effective and less toxic, and is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in the United States and abroad.\r"

The psychophysical tests have proved to be simple and inexpensive to administer; in good hands, they are repeatable. Although psychophysical lifting capacity was less in those with previous LBP, the psychophysical strength tests were poor predictors of future LBP. But when the previous history of LBP was known, then the test results significantly enhanced the prediction.\r"

The lumbar fibers arise from the lumbar accessory processes and the L1-4 transverse processes, and insert independently of the erector spinae aponeurosis into the ilium. The intrinsic lumbar fibers of the erector spinae are poorly described in the literature, and the existence of the iliocostalis lumborum pars lumborum has rarely been recognized even though it constitutes a substantial portion of the total muscle mass acting directly on the lumbar vertebrae.\r"

To study the biomechanical functions of this ligament, an apparatus was developed using linear variable differential transformers. Twenty fresh cadaveric specimens of the lumbosacral pelvis were tested. The flexibility of the intact lumbar segment was studied before and after the ligaments were divided. Flexion of L5 on S1 was mainly controlled by the posterior band and lateral bending by the anterior band of the ligament. When the L5-S1 disc was degenerated, total division of the ligaments reduced extension during loading. Its effect on torsion was not evident from this study.\r"

During a 4-year period, 12 patients fulfilled these criteria. One patient had a unilateral chronic compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy of the erector spinae muscle normalized the intramuscular pressure during exercise and at rest after exercise, and relieved the pain. All the other patients with chronic low-back pain had normal intramuscular pressure findings.

Two lifting methods (bent knee, straight leg) and two foot positions were used. The results indicate the bent-knee lift method and forward-foot position was the position of optimal force production. Force production increase was inversely proportional to age. The authors concluded that the isokinetic lift device has promising capabilities to produce repeatable data and may be advantageous in generating standards for rehabilitation and specific job criteria.\r"

A comparison was made between this measured motion, the clinical symptoms, response to facet joint injection of anesthetic, and radiologic appearance of disc space and facets. The magnitude of the flexion motion and the magnitude of the anteroposterior (AP) shear motion accompanying the flexion was slightly less at symptomatic compared with nonsymptomatic levels. In most patients the AP shear motion at all levels was less than 3 mm (maximum 7 mm). The amount of forward shear motion correlated positively with the amount of flexion motion (r = 0.3). The shear-flexion ratio was significantly reduced at symptomatic levels of patients. Although this group of patients, taken as a whole, showed a tendency toward abnormal intersegmental motion of the lumbar spine, it was found that flexion-extension biplanar radiography was not useful in the diagnosis of lumbar instability.\r"

All subjects completed a questionnaire to determine the history of their back injury and a description of their exercise behavior patterns. Body composition was estimated by hydrostatic weighing. Maximum oxygen consumption was predicted using the Astrand-Ryhming nomogram. Strength scores were determined from a battery of cable tensiometer tests. Dependent variables were analyzed using a multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA). Using discriminant analysis, as a post hoc test, predicted maximum oxygen consumption was shown to account for the difference between the groups (P less than .002). The control subjects' values were higher than the patients' values. Subjects' exercise history indicated no differences between the groups relative to the time period preceding the onset of injury (P greater than .05). The exercise activity of patients was significantly reduced after injury (P less than .001). An average of 87 days elapsed between the onset of injury to the date of fitness testing.\r"

A constant pattern of gradual reduction of nuclear signal was seen in all cases. Complete loss of signal took at least 6 weeks and corresponded to the maximum reduction in disc space height. Seventeen patients were scanned at more than 1 year after treatment. Of these, 13 had been treated by chemonucleolysis alone. No significant return of signal from the nucleus pulposus was noted despite a slight reconstitution in disc space height. Chymopapain produced irreversible changes analogous to gross premature disc degeneration.

Upward migration of the odontoid was evaluated by Ranawat's and Redlund-Johnell's methods after determining the normal range in healthy Japanese adults. Of the 100 patients treated conservatively, atlanto-axial dislocation was found in 49% and upward migration of the odontoid in 26% by the former method, and in 8% by the latter method. The detection rate of these lesions increased with the increase in the duration of the disease and progression of rheumatoid lesions. Abnormal Ranawat values are associated with lesions in the C1-C2 segment and abnormal Redlund-Johnell values with 0-C2 lesions. The latter suggests severe conditions and seems to be a useful indicator for the diagnosis of upward migration of the odontoid in our study. Though rheumatoid lesions in the upper cervical spine mainly involved the C1-C2 level, marked deterioration of the atlanto-occipital joints was also occasionally observed. Therefore, in surgical treatment, attention should be paid also to this region. Patients with abnormal Redlund-Johnell values require spinal fixation including the occipital bone.\r"

The ranges of axial rotation at the levels occiput C0-C1, C1-C2, and C2-C3 were measured. A rotation at C0-C1 greater than 8 degrees; at C1-C2, 56 degrees; or a right-left difference C0-C1 greater than 5 degrees and C1-2 greater than 8 degrees indicates hypermobility. A rotation at segment C1-C2 of less than 28 degrees indicates hypomobility. Surgical stabilization of rotatory instability could be considered as a possible therapeutic procedure.\r"

  ".W": "A computed tomography (CT) study of rotation of the cervical spine was undertaken in normal subjects aged 20 to 26 years. Section scans through the neck were made with the head in maximal rotation to the right or the left. Occiput, cervical spine, and first thoracic vertebra, thus, were depicted in different degrees of rotation with respect to the sagittal plane. These differences indicated the maximal degree of rotation in each of the eight segments between occiput and thoracic spine. Mean values for these segments were 1.0 degree, 40.5 degrees, 3.0 degrees, 6.5 degrees, 6.8 degrees, 6.9 degrees, 5.4 degrees and 2.1 degrees, respectively. Measurement error proved to be relatively small. By means of CT sections in the plane of the intervertebral joints (in three subjects in midposition, in one subject in maximal rotation of the head to one side) an axis of rotation could be constructed from the anatomic shape of the uncovertebral joints. The theory of Hall that the unciform processes are essential for rotation is confirmed and further elaborated.\r"

An alternative to this technique, a two-staged microsurgical approach, allows complete excision of the tumor and thus offers a chance for cure. Two patients have been treated in this manner, and more than 3 years after the operations, both patients were still improving neurologically without any evidence of tumor recurrence.\r"

Regardless of contouring, there was a decrease in total lumbar lordosis and lordosis above L4, with an increase in lordosis below L5. Although not statistically significant, patients with contoured rods had less loss of segmental (L1-4) lordosis and less increase in segmental lumbosacral lordosis (L4-S1) than the noncontoured group. Although helpful, additional steps beyond concave rod contouring appear to be necessary to consistently preserve lumbar lordosis.\r"

The other states did not have the requested information available. Analysis of 2932 spinal injury cases evaluated for disability in a 7-year period showed a mean of 23.4 months of medical treatment in 1706 cases concluded with no disability. Also, 91% of the claimants represented by counsel were not working, whereas 77% not so represented were working. Most of the consultative medical reports, insurance carriers' and claimants', veered on the adversarial and favored the respective interested party. The cost of workers' compensation back injury claims is very high. The conclusion is inescapable that iatrogenic and jurisgenic factors have a direct effect (in the cohort of cases analyzed) on the prolongation of medical care, and delay in returning to gainful employment, and, consequently, contributing to the high cost.\r"

The IEMG-torque ratio (efficiency of electrical activity, or EEA) was used to characterize each subject. Individual recordings showed evidence of nonlinearity of the IEMG-torque relationship in that a statistically better fit to experimental recordings was obtained by using two straight lines with a breakpoint between them. However, with repeated testing, the gradients of these two lines were more variable than the slope of the single straight line fitted to the entire recording. The slope of the best fit line (EEA) was less for recordings made during torque decrease than for increasing-torque recordings. This also showed as a \"hysteresis\" pattern in the recordings. The coefficient of variability (within subjects) of the EEA was greater in day-to-day testing (24%) than with repeated pulls at the same testing session (14%). This was similar to variability of the maximum generated torque. About 25% of the variability between subjects was found to be due to anthropometric differences. The residual variability of the relationship would limit the accuracy of IEMG as a measure of muscular effort under changing torque conditions. However, the EEA may be useful for characterizing muscle performance, especially when maximum effort cannot be achieved.\r"

Interrater reliability of the finalized seven-item scale was excellent (R = 0.93).

The basic experimental set-up involved drilling a sagittal plane hole transversely across a vertebral body to provide direct access to the anterior aspect of the neural canal. After securing a probe and linearly variable differential transformer (LVDT) assembly at each site to be tested, the probe was gently pushed into the neural canal; contact force against the tip of the probe as well as the depth of probe penetration was measured and recorded. Laminectomy did not alter the resulting contact force/anterior penetration plots at the fifth cervical, seventh thoracic, 12th thoracic, or third lumbar vertebra. Using the probe/LVDT assembly to measure anterior dural displacement and a cantilever displacement device to measure posterior dural displacement after laminectomy at the 12th thoracic vertebra, the authors found that although the anterior dura underwent gross displacement as the probe was pushed into the neural canal, the posterior dura displaced to a minimal degree. The extent of the laminectomy was not a factor. The study did not demonstrate any possible mechanism by which laminectomy could reduce the pressure exerted on the dura and neural elements by an anterior mass in a spine with otherwise normal neural canal dimensions.\r"

Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scans were helpful in determining the levels requiring decompression. However, in the multiply operated patient, contrast-enhanced CT scans were misleading in six patients. Patients with lateral spinal stenosis were treated with unilateral laminectomy and partial facetectomy. The 29 patients with central-mixed stenosis underwent decompressive laminectomy and bilateral facetectomies. Six fusions were done. In the nine patients with spinal stenosis and scoliosis, concaveside partial facetectomies and laminectomies were done as well as spinal fusions. The 32 patients with spinal stenosis after previous laminectomy and spinal fusions were the most difficult group to analyze, and their treatment was the least standardized. There were 19 good, eight fair, and five poor results in those who had undergone previous surgery. Fifty-seven of the 80 patients (71%) experienced a good result from their surgical treatment.\r"

This study was done to determine whether or not the volume of postoperative wound drainage was related to the frequency of seromas and lymphedema of the arm. The daily wound drainage and the total hospital drainage (THD) were recorded for 49 consecutive patients who had undergone a mastectomy and the results were correlated with the frequency of seromas and lymphedema. All of the patients had modified mastectomies and no irradiation. All had closed suction drainage and none had flap necrosis or infection. Suction catheters were discontinued three to 15 days after operation at the discretion of the surgeon. THD varied from 227 to 3,607 milliliters and did not correlate with body weight. Twenty-six patients had wound seromas develop requiring drainage for up to seven months, most often with repeated aspirations, but in four instances ultimately with open drainage. THD and 24 hour drainage immediately prior to discontinuing suction catheters correlated directly with the frequency of seroma formation. No patient with less than 20 centimeters of drainage in the 24 hours prior to catheter removal had a seroma. Ipsilateral edema of the arm (more than 3 centimeters difference in circumference) developed in five patients. THD was directly correlated with the frequency of edema of the arm. No patient with less than 500 milliliters of THD had edema develop whereas the frequency rate was 75 per cent with THD of more than 900 milliliters. It was concluded that THD likely reflects the magnitude of lymphatic interruption after mastectomy and, consequently, the likelihood of lymphatic insufficiency and lymphedema. Minimal wound drainage of 24 hours before discontinuing closed drainage catheters minimized seroma formation.\r"

  ".W": "Peritoneal lavages performed in 161 patients who had sustained blunt (93 per cent) and penetrating (7 per cent) trauma were prospectively studied in order to assess our indications and technique, as well as to document the accuracy and complication rate in the hands of an Advanced Trauma Life Support trained resident staff. The most common indication for the performance of a lavage was blunt trauma to the abdomen associated with an altered mental status due to injury to the head or substance abuse. The semiopen technique was used 91.0 per cent of the time with a complication rate of 0.6 per cent. The open technique was used 9 per cent of the time on patients who had undergone previous limited abdominal operations, those who were pregnant, those with dilated intestine and for those patients with evidence of portal hypertension. Aspiration of greater than 10 milliliters of gross blood, an erythrocyte count greater than 100,000 per millimeter to the third power, or a white blood cell count greater than 500 per millimeter to the third power or an elevated amylase or bilirubin level in the lavage effluent, were the criteria used for a positive result in blunt trauma. The accuracy rate was 93 per cent with eight false-positive and three false-negative examinations. The sensitivity rate was 94 per cent and the specificity rate was 93 per cent. While most reported series classify lavage results as true-positive when intraperitoneal blood is found at exploration, even if secondary to trivial injuries which do not require surgical therapy (nontherapeutic laparotomy), we believe that these should be classified as false-positive results, as was done in this study. Computerized tomographic scanning may be more useful than peritoneal lavage in the evaluation of patients with pelvic fractures or other retroperitoneal injuries which often result in false-positive lavage. Peritoneal lavage is often an inaccurate indicator of isolated intestine and diaphragmatic or retroperitoneal injury. Given its simplicity, low complication rate and accuracy, peritoneal lavage can be safely performed by surgeons in training to evaluate the victim of trauma.\r"

In 354 patients, early postoperative complications were observed, among whom wound and pulmonary infections were most common. A fatal outcome was noted in 32 patients for a mortality rate of 4.7 per cent. The incidence of early complications after splenectomy is higher than after most other surgical procedures within the abdominal cavity and depends upon the underlying diseases which lead to splenectomy. Deficient immunologic defense mechanisms may be a significant factor in the development of early complications in patients after splenectomy.\r"

In recent years, the positive predictive value has increased from 68 per cent due to the development of magnification mammography and the use of a mammographic grid. Correlating mammographic and histopathologic data, the rate of malignant disease was 12.7 per cent for instances of a circumscribed or nodular mass, 32.4 per cent for clustered microcalcifications as the only suspect finding, 28.6 per cent when a mass with microcalcifications was present and 66.7 per cent when a stellate-shaped mass was found. Of 188 instances of carcinoma, 40 were noninvasive: 32 instances of ductal carcinoma (27.1 per cent) and eight of lobular carcinoma in situ (6.8 per cent). The possibility of frozen section diagnosis was studied retrospectively by comparison with the paraffin section reports. A correct diagnosis, whether benign or malignant, was achieved in 68 per cent. No frozen section examination was done in 17.3 per cent and the diagnosis was deferred to results of paraffin section in 12.2 per cent. False-negative results were encountered in seven patients (1.9 per cent) and false-positive results in two (0.6 per cent). Both of these patients had florid sclerosing adenosis. Although frozen section diagnosis is feasible in nonpalpable lesions of the breast, it is recommended that this method not be used in instances of pure microcalcifications and tiny solid masses of 5 millimeters or less.\r"

Nine of the groups were fed nutrient solutions of different compositions, antacid and sucralfate through orogastric tube during induction of stress ulcer by restraint and a cold ambient temperature. One group served as a control group and received no feeding and the 11th group was given cimetidine intraperitoneally. The extensiveness of the stress effect was estimated in each group by the number of rats with ulcer as percentage, the mean number of ulcers in each rat, the mean distribution of ulcers of different sizes, the mean total of mucosal damage in each rat and the contribution of ulcers of a different size to the total mucosal damage. The results showed that cimetidine is an effective protector against stress ulcer. Guar gum, Intralipid (fat emulsion), egg protein and 30 per cent glucose are slightly weaker protectors than cimetidine but much stronger than 10 per cent glucose wheat flour and distilled water. Sucralfate increased the susceptibility to stress ulcer. The second part of the study consisted of 86 rats. It showed, that guar gum increased the healing rate of stress ulcers. During a 30 hour treatment period after four hours of stress, the rats fed guar gum (n = 30) showed a lower (p less than 0.001) number of ulcers than the control rats fed normal rat food (n = 26) or immediately after the four hours of stress (n = 30). The mechanisms suggested for ulcer prevention and increased ulcer healing rate found herein may be due to reduced acidity, increased local mucosal supply of energy and mechanical protection.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 294 primary cesarean section and repeat cesarean section deliveries with premature rupture of membranes which occurred over a two year period to determine if an association existed between postoperative endometritis and the level of physician training. The results of preliminary analysis revealed that a relationship existed between the level of physician training and the presence of endometritis (p less than 0.01). Endometritis rates for patients under the care of attending physicians, chief residents and residents serving as the primary surgeon were six, 13 and 24 per cent, respectively. Stepwise discriminant function analysis allowed us to account for the contribution of independent risk factors for endometritis. When surgeon experience was evaluated with other risk factors, the presence of a resident serving as the lead surgeon and the age of the patient were the only significant predictors of endometritis (p = 0.046 and 0.007, respectively). The clinical and biologic relevance of the actual age difference between infected and noninfected patients (22 years for infected patients versus 25 years for noninfected patients) is not readily apparent. However, in this study, the identification of a resident acting as a lead surgeon has been shown to be a new independent risk factor for predicting endometritis. This study demonstrates the need for the evaluation of training programs for residents who serve as the principal surgeon for patients who underwent cesarean section.\r"

  ".U": "88071172\r", 
  ".W": "Thirty-six patients admitted with severe head injury and various degrees of systemic hypotension were studied to determine the effect of hypotension on the validity of the neurological examination in reflecting mechanical brain compression. All patients had clinical signs of transtentorial herniation or upper brainstem compression and underwent immediate bilateral placement of exploratory burr holes for the diagnosis and removal of intracranial hematomas. All patients were initially hypotensive: 10 were in cardiac arrest, 7 had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 60 torr, and 19 had SBP of 60-90 torr. The median score on the Glascow coma scale was 3 (range 3-8). Although 4 of the 10 cardiac arrest patients had anisocoria, only one (10%) had an intracranial hematoma. Among the seven patients with severe hypotension, only two had anisocoria and neither had and intracranial hematoma; one patient in this group (14%) had a hematoma that was diagnosed at autopsy. In contrast, intracranial hematomas were discovered by burr-hole placement and evacuated in 13 (68%) of 19 patients with initially moderate hypotension, including seven (78%) of nine patients with anisocoria. Anisocoria was associated with mechanical brain compression from an intracranial hematoma significantly more often in patients with an initial SBP of 60-90 torr than in those with initial cardiac arrest or SBP less than 60 torr (chi-square p less than 0.05). Intracranial hematomas were significantly more frequent among patients with SBP of 60-90 torr than among those with a lower SBP or initial cardiac arrest (P less than 0.01). Thirty-three of 36 patients died; each of the three survivors had an initial SBP of 60-90 torr, and hematomas were removed in two. In head-injured patients with SBP greater than 60 torr, clinical signs of tentorial herniation or upper brainstem dysfunction remain valid indicators of possible mechanical compression; the high percentage of patients with acute intracranial hematomas in this group warrants immediate diagnostic burr-hole exploration. In patients with severe initial hypotension (SBP less than 60 torr) or cardiac arrest, clinical findings of brainstem dysfunction cannot be relied upon to indicate mechanical compression, and computed tomography scanning should be done immediately after resuscitation to determine the need for surgical exploration.\r"

Nicardipine in a dosage of 1 mg/kg effectively attenuated the liberation of FFAs, particularly that of arachidonic acid which is known as the precursor of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. The FFAs of the brain have been known as one of the biochemical markers that indicate ischemic damage of the brain cell membrane.

The nature of the fungal granuloma was verified histopathologically. The second case, a 40-year-old man, possessed bilateral basal ganglionic lesions in which the CT scanning suggested abscesses. Postmortem examination confirmed the presence of phycomycotic abscesses. There was no evidence of systemic mycoses in both cases. Review of the clinical features of this fatal complication in drug abusers and narcotic addicts disclosed that hemiparesis and facial weakness are common. Brain or CT scan along with brain biopsy are necessary for rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment.\r"

This prompted a review of our experience with dimethyltriazeno imidazole carboxamide (dacarbazine) (DTIC) treatment for these tumors. From 1976 to 1986, 14 patients were treated with DTIC for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. There were seven men and seven women whose ages ranged from 19 to 76 years. Diagnoses included eight nonfunctioning islet-cell carcinomas, three retroperitoneal neuroendocrine tumors, two glucagonomas, and one ileal carcinoid. Before DTIC chemotherapy, four patients were treated with streptozotocin and 5-FU, and one was treated with cytoxan and methotrexate without response. Two patients who were initially treated with DTIC with no response were subsequently treated with streptozotocin and 5-FU without benefit. Standard treatment with DTIC consisted of monthly cycles of 250 mg/m2/day administered intravenously for 5 days. Seven patients had an objective response to DTIC with both improvement in quality of life and a decrease of more than 50% in tumor size on computerized tomography (CT) or liver scanning. Response duration ranged from 1 to 10 years. One patient with a glucagonoma was treated for two years and had no evidence of disease at laparotomy 7 years later. Four patients with nonfunctioning islet cell carcinoma had a positive response to DTIC, but three of these patients had tumor recurrence 3 to 6 years after treatment. Two patients with retroperitoneal neuroendocrine tumors had a positive response to DTIC treatment. One patient with a glucagonoma and one with a nonfunctioning islet-cell tumor had equivocal responses with transient clinical improvement but no objective changes in tumor size. Five patients did not respond; two were given DTIC therapy as a last resort and died 1 and 12 days later. Of the other three patients, two died 6 months and one 2 years after treatment. DTIC chemotherapy was effective in 50% of patients with intra-abdominal neuroendocrine tumors. Although DTIC therapy was associated with nausea, no major gastrointestinal, hematologic, or renal complications were noted. This favorable experience with DTIC chemotherapy for nonresectable intra-abdominal neuroendocrine tumors indicates that further clinical evaluation and use are warranted.\r"

Nine (17%) tumors had a normal (diploid) DNA pattern, 13 (25%) were DNA tetraploid, and 30 (58%) were DNA aneuploid. The DNA aneuploid group was subdivided: 18 tumors with one stemline and 12 tumors with two stemlines of abnormal DNA cells. For tumors that were resected for cure, the 5-year Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival rates of the five patients with DNA diploid tumors and of the six patients with DNA tetraploid tumors were 80% and 33%, respectively. For 21 patients of whom 12 had one-stemline and nine had two-stemline DNA aneuploid tumors, the survival was 67% and 0%, respectively. Following palliative resection, the 4-year survival rates of the four patients with DNA diploid, seven with DNA tetraploid, five (omitting one with short follow-up) with one-stemline DNA aneuploid, and three with two-stemline DNA aneuploid tumors were 0%, 0%, 0%, and 33%, respectively. Although adrenocortical carcinoma is in general markedly aggressive, the addition of nuclear DNA ploidy studies may help to identify certain groups of patients who have a relatively favorable prognosis.\r"

We measured calcitonin (CT) secretion, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation in vitro and their response to various substances. Nerve growth factor (NGF) (0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml), glucagon (0.01 to 100 micrograms/ml), and isoproterenol (4 to 500 micrograms/ml) stimulated CT secretion and DNA synthesis in hMTC cells. Other substances, calcium (1.0 to 15 mmol), pentagastrin (1.0 to 50 mumol), dibutyryl-cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate (1.0 to 100 mumol), and phorbol ester TPA (1.0 to 100 nmol), stimulated CT secretion but not DNA synthesis. In addition, NGF enhanced cell proliferation of hMTC cells 2- to 3- fold and caused an increased sensitivity of these cells for chemotherapy in vitro. Thus 0.5 microgram/ml doxorubicin (half-maximal effective dose) induced a cell death rate of up to 32.8%, which was enhanced by preincubation with NGF to 68.1% (1.0 microgram/ml, NGF) and to 100% (10.0 micrograms/ml, NGF), respectively. Pulsative stimulation of APUD cell carcinomas with NGF may therefore improve the response rate of these tumors to chemotherapy, which would be of significant clinical importance for patients with residual postoperative MTC tissue.\r"

When radioactive iodine was administered to 8-week-old Long-Evans rats, this incidence was reduced, although thyroid follicular cell neoplasia was increased. The aim of this study was to determine whether iodine-131 (131I) administered to an aged population of Long-Evans rats with established C cell hyperplasia would have a C cell ablative effect as pronounced as that observed in studies of young rats. For this study, 180 18-month-old Long-Evans rats (90 male and 90 female) were used. Baseline serum calcitonin levels were determined, and control and experimental groups containing equal numbers of animals were designated. 131I was administered by intraperitoneal injection to the experimental group, while equal volumes of saline solution were given to the control group. Blood samples for determination of serum calcitonin levels were obtained at 6-week intervals until the rats were 24 months old. Thyroid glands were then removed, and tissues were fixed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) using an anticalcitonin antibody. Examination of thyroid tissues showed that the incidence of C cell neoplasia was significantly reduced in irradiated animals as compared with nonirradiated controls (chi 2 analysis, p less than 0.05). PAP staining demonstrated diminished intracytoplasmic calcitonin in the radiation-treated group. Analysis of serum calcitonin levels over time showed significantly lower levels in the irradiated rat group than in the nonirradiated group (p less than 0.006).\r"

While it was still under investigation, 529 patients were managed with this drug at the Mayo Clinic between 1981 and 1986; eight of them (1.5%) had thyrotoxicosis 12 to 37 months (median, 28 months) after initiation of treatment. Low 24-hour iodine-131 uptake (less than 4%) and recognized refractoriness to thionamide treatment precluded the use of radioablation or antithyroid drugs. Cessation of the amiodarone treatment was considered undesirable from a cardiac standpoint. Near-total thyroidectomies were undertaken in six patients, and rapid correction of hyperthyroidism followed. There were no intraoperative or postoperative arrhythmias. The median postoperative hospital stay was 4.3 days (range, 2 to 13 days). Subsequently, all patients required thyroid hormone replacement. Near-total thyroidectomy has proved a safe and effective treatment for amiodarone-associated thyrotoxicosis in patients who required drug continuation.\r"

However, our institution cares for a large number of patients with untreated multinodular goiters, and in the progression of this disorder, tracheal deviation and airway problems are relatively common. During the past 4 years, we have cared for 24 patients who were admitted with acute, life-threatening airway distress that required emergency intervention. Nine patients had emergency intubation, the remaining 15 had stridor on admission and underwent emergency operations. The series consists of 19 females and five males whose ages ranged from 37 to 89 years. Only four patients had malignant thyroid lesions (two papillary-follicular, two anaplastic), and two of these had multiple pulmonary metastases. Fifteen of the patients with multinodular goiters had a mediastinal extension that led to marked tracheal deviation. Three patients had recurrent multinodular goiters decades after previous surgery. Twenty-one patients underwent surgery at our institution, and all did well. Only one patient required sternotomy for thyroidectomy. Two patients required tracheostomy procedures, one because of tracheomalacia and the other because of poor pulmonary reserve. Interestingly, two patients had acute symptoms when in their third trimester of pregnancy. We have routinely used the laryngoscope (fiberoptic rigid or flexible) for preoperative and postoperative evaluation of the vocal cords and for determination of the condition of the larynx. On the basis of our experience with acute airway distress, we strongly advocate elective surgery for patients with multinodular goiter at the first sign of tracheal compression, especially if they have mediastinal extension.\r"

A subgroup of 37 patients, 14 with apparent aggressive cancer, was studied. This study group consisted of 27 female and 10 male patients with mixed papillary and follicular cancer, who ranged in age from 11 to 40 years. Nodal disease occurred in 27 (73%) patients and invasiveness in 30 (81%) patients and involved multiple areas in 9 (24%) patients. Recurrence occurred in 14 (38%) patients and visceral metastases occurred in eight (22%) patients. All patients underwent appropriate surgery, but microscopic residual disease was seen in 15 patients and gross residual disease in seven patients, so that 31 patients underwent iodine-131 therapy, and 17 of these patients also underwent external radiation therapy. Three patients died of their disease, whereas 24 (65%) patients are free of disease and 9 (24%) patients are alive with disease. An additional 7 (19%) patients were initially seen in the fifth to seventh decade after decades of neglected thyroid disease, which culminated in residual cancer and death. Although low-risk categorization for thyroid cancer appears valid, its rigid application in support of conservative treatment may lead to inadequate primary treatment and underdiagnosis of cancer in thyroid nodule disease in the low-risk age population.\r"

This scoring system can identify patients at increased risk of PTC mortality and was employed as an adjustment variable for analyzing the role of different types of surgical treatment in 860 PTC patients. Cancer mortality at 25 years in patients with an AGES score of 3.99 or less was 1% after ipsilateral lobectomy (n = 131) and 2% after bilateral resection (n = 603), whether subtotal or total (p = 0.15). Of patients with an AGES score of 4 or more, those who underwent lobectomy alone (n = 30) had a mortality rate from PTC at 25 years of 65%, while those undergoing bilateral resection (n = 86) had a lower rate of 35% (p = 0.06). For patients at minimal risk (score of 3.99 or less) of PTC death, no improvement in survival was demonstrable when patients underwent more than ipsilateral lobectomy. However, in a subgroup (score of 4 or more) identified to be at significant risk of PTC death, the survival after bilateral resection was much higher than after ipsilateral lobectomy alone. In neither the \"minimal\" nor the \"higher\" risk subgroup was PTC survival significantly improved by the performance of total thyroidectomy.\r"

The fluid, cytologically examined, showed no evidence of carcinoma except in three instances: papillary carcinomas that were subsequently treated surgically. Of the cystic lesions, 19 (11%) recurred and were treated by reaspiration and the instillation of tetracycline hydrochloride into the cyst cavity. In all but one instance this resulted in obliteration of the cysts (95%). This is a considerably higher rate of success than that reported from aspiration alone (40% to 85%). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 42 months, with no recurrence or subsequent development of a thyroid nodule in these patients. The one recurrent cyst was reaspirated and reinstilled a second time, which resulted in great reduction in size. Not considered for this procedure were patients in whom the cytologic condition of the fluid was abnormal or indicative of a malignancy. Also excluded were those in whom there was incomplete decompression of the cyst, manifested by a persistent nodule. No patients had a history of head or neck irradiation or cervical lymphadenopathy, both contraindications for this procedure. No patients had grossly bloody aspirates. Recurrence of thyroid cysts after aspiration was not thought to be, in itself, a criterion for surgical selection. The effective use of tetracycline hydrochloride as a sclerosing agent in the treatment of malignant pleural effusions is well documented. Its action in producing symphysis is thought to be related to its low pH (2.0). This procedure is safe, simple, cost effective, and well tolerated by patients. It obviates the need for excision in patients who fulfill the aforementioned criteria.\r"

These lesions have a significantly different biologic potential than similar lesions in older patients. In the younger age group there is a more rapid progression toward toxicity and a higher incidence of thyroid carcinoma. Our experience with 12 patients is combined with those previously reported for identification of a total of 61 children and adolescents with AFTNs, of whom 53 have undergone operation. Hyperthyroidism was present in 15 patients (24.6%), and in six patients (11.3%) the AFTN was due to a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Surgical treatment is advisable for all children and adolescents with AFTNs because of the risks of hyperthyroidism and thyroid carcinoma. Surgical excision (lobectomy is preferred) results in rapid restoration of a euthyroid state for the toxic AFTN and allows histopathologic diagnosis. Therapy with radioiodine is not advisable for treatment of AFTNs in this age group. Thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression should be used for all patients with a diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma.\r"

Patients identified with parathyroid hyperplasia (more than one gland excised) and patients who later developed mild renal failure were excluded. Seventy-seven patients undergoing parathyroidectomy with only one enlarged gland removed and the other normal-sized glands viewed or examined by biopsy were followed up from 5 to 16 years. Two patients developed recurrent hypercalcemia at 4 and 9 years after surgery. Seventy-five patients are considered \"cured\" and have normal serum calcium values. However, 28 (37%) of these normocalcemic patients have persistent elevations of parathyroid hormone. This increased parathyroid gland function suggests a continuing stimulation of the remaining glands. The rarity of clinical recurrence may be related to effective adaptations that prevent overt hypercalcemia. Many parathyroid adenomas appear to represent nonneoplastic disease.\r"

Although the formation of urinary calculi was stopped in 91% of patients, deteriorated renal function and hypertension were seen in patients with symptoms (14% and 8%, respectively) and patients with minimal symptoms of PHP (6% and 15%, respectively). Renal function changes and hypertension were unpredictable despite normalization of the hyperactive parathyroid metabolism and had decisive results: 7% of the patients died of uremia or of the consequences of hypertension (stroke). Large, multiple bone lesions healed functionally and were of no prognostic significance. In the majority of patients with symptoms of PHP, gastrointestinal manifestations healed postoperatively, but two patients who had no preoperative gastrointestinal complaints died of acute pancreatitis. Almost all symptoms of the hypercalcemia syndrome disappeared immediately and permanently in patients with symptoms and patients with minimal symptoms of PHP. Neither deterioration of renal function nor elevation of blood pressure were observed postoperatively in \"cured\" patients who showed no symptoms of PHP preoperatively. Even in these patients, immediate surgical treatment may have avoided the complications of chronic renal failure or hypertension. As soon as organic manifestations, even in mild form, have been established, it seems impossible to predict the course and to prevent an unfavorable clinical outcome.\r"

The reported occurrence of renal stone disease in untreated patients with pHPT is 15% to 30%. A registry of 258 pHPT patients who underwent parathyroidectomies at the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center has allowed continued follow-up of the 71 (28%) pHPT patients with associated renal stone disease. Patients have been followed up for an average of 5 years (range, 1 to 15 years) since surgery. The rate of renal stone formation before and after parathyroidectomy was compared. Identification of a \"new\" renal stone was defined as passage and collection, extraction, or radiographic visualization of stones. All 71 pHPT patients with stone disease had hypercalcemia and inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone concentrations, and after parathyroidectomy these values returned to normal in 69 of 71 patients. Since undergoing parathyroidectomy, only 4 patients have passed renal stones. The rate of stone formation per patient per year was 0.36 before and 0.02 after surgery (p less than 0.001). Surgical correction of pHPT significantly reduced the rate of stone formation.\r"

  ".W": "A recently developed chemiluminescent immunoassay for 1-84 intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) demonstrated increased specificity by virtue of two-site antibody binding and increased sensitivity by use of a chemiluminescent technique. Basal PTH levels were measured in three groups of subjects: (1) normal (n = 82), (2) hyperparathyroidism (n = 31), and (3) patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (n = 16). There was good discrimination between normal (1.2 to 9.4 pmol/L) and hyperparathyroid subjects (9.2 to 53.4 pmol/L). In persons with hypercalcemia of malignancy all PTH levels were within the normal range (0.8 to 5.2 pmol/L) or suppressed. PTH release was stimulated by the intramuscular injection of 100 IU salmon calcitonin in 6 normal controls, 10 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism due to adenoma, and 5 with four-gland hyperplasia. There was no significant rise in PTH concentration and out of the normal range in the control subjects, but the adenoma patients demonstrated a mean rise of 24.4%, 26%, and 33%, and hyperplasia patients, a mean rise of 37%, 47%, and 37% over basal levels at 120, 180, and 240 minutes. The mean absolute rise in PTH concentration was 13.4 +/- 7.7 pmol/gm of parathyroid tissue in the adenomas and 27.2 +/- 9.5 pmol/gm of parathyroid tissue in the hyperplastic glands; this difference was significant (p less than 0.05). Serial blood samples from a central vein were taken at surgery for hyperparathyroidism, and the rate of decay of the intact hormone was studied in 9 patients after removal of the parathyroid tissue. This decay was rapid with a half-life of 300 seconds. We conclude that this new specific and sensitive intact PTH assay will provide a valuable means of investigating dynamic aspects of parathyroid physiology.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular events that regulate parathyroid hormone (PTH) release are not well understood. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent protein kinases play a role in the regulation of release due to several agonists, but these factors do not fully explain PTH release that is mediated by extracellular ionized calcium (Ca++). A calcium-phospholipid-dependent (non-cAMP-dependent) protein kinase can be activated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). To determine whether this protein kinase regulates PTH release, we examined the effect of TPA on PTH release from human parathyroid tissue. Cell suspensions of abnormal parathyroid tissue removed at surgery were prepared by enzymatic dispersion and incubated for several hours with and without 10(-7) mol/L TPA at low and high calcium levels. In ten preparations in the absence of TPA, increasing Ca++ from 0.25 to 2.5 mmol/L reduced PTH release to an average of 39% of maximal release (range, 11% to 67%). The effect on TPA on Ca++-regulated PTH release appeared biphasic. At low (0.25 mmol/L) Ca++ level, TPA suppressed PTH release to an average of 78% of maximal release without TPA (95% confidence interval, 67% to 88%) (p less than 0.01 compared to cells incubated without TPA). At high (2.25 mmol/L) Ca++ level, TPA augmented PTH release from an average of 39% of maximal release without TPA to 62% of maximal release without TPA (95% confidence level, 48% to 78%), an average augmentation of 22% (95% confidence level, 9% to 36%) (p less than 0.01 compared with cells incubated without TPA). TPA appeared to make PTH release independent of Ca++. Both inhibitory and stimulatory effects were dose dependent. Incubations with TPA demonstrated no toxicity as judged by trypan blue dye exclusion, linearity of PTH release, and cellular incorporation of tritiated leucine. TPA had no effect on the radioimmunoassay for PTH. We conclude that a calcium/phospholipid-dependent, non-cAMP-dependent protein kinase may play a role in mediating Ca++-regulated PTH release from abnormal human parathyroid cells. Its site of action and integration with other regulatory pathways remain to be determined.\r"

This series included 50 (4%) unusual cases that involved anomalous parathyroid locations or supernumerary hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. In 42 cases the diseased glands were found in unusual locations: In three patients, glands were high in the neck behind the angle of the jaw; nine patients' glands were entirely encapsulated within the thyroid gland; and 30 patients required sternotomy for removal of mediastinal tumors. The eight remaining patients (as well as five of the mediastinal cases) had supernumerary hyperfunctioning glands. The three undescended parapharyngeal neoplasms, five of the cervical supernumerary tumors, and the majority of the mediastinal glands were associated with the thymus gland or thymic remnants. These glands appeared to arise from undescended parapharyngeal vestiges, partially descended parathymus remnants deposited along the path of developmental migration, or hyperdescended mediastinal inferior glands from branchial pouch III. The nine intrathyroid parathyroids were totally enclosed within the thyroid parenchyma. These appeared to arise from superior parathyroid glands that were trapped during fusion of the lateral wing portion from branchial pouch IV with the developing lateral lobes of the median thyroid primordium. Of these fifty cases, 39 patients had undergone a total of 60 previous operations (57 cervical and three mediastinal explorations) at MGH (16 patients) or other institutions (23 patients). In eleven patients the unusual hyperfunctioning gland was successfully identified at the time of the initial operation. Forty-four patients (88%) were surgically cured, as evidenced by eucalcemia. There were six patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism and none with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.\r"

After parathyroidectomy, 9 of 10 patients remained normocalcemic, and each had a lower BAO; 6 of 9 no longer had gastric acid hypersecretion (less than 15 mEq/hr). Seven of 9 normocalcemic patients had a lower MAO, and a decrease in fasting serum gastrin. Two patients showed no evidence of ZES, a normal BAO, normal fasting serum gastrin concentration, and a negative secretin response after parathyroidectomy. Parathyroidectomy also reduced the dose of histamine H2-receptor antagonist required to control gastric acid secretion in 60% of patients. After successful parathyroidectomy three patients were studied for drug sensitivity, and each had greater acid inhibition with a given dose of histamine H2-receptor antagonist than preoperatively. One patient remained hypercalcemic after surgery and had no change in BAO, MAO, or gastrin. All patients with postoperative normocalcemia will have a lower BAO, 80% a lower MAO, 80% a decreased fasting serum gastrin, and 33% a negative secretin test. Antisecretory medication dose can be reduced because patients have reduced BAO and increased sensitivity to histamine H2-receptor antagonist. The study supports parathyroidectomy as the initial surgical procedure of choice in patients with PHP, ZES, and MEN-I.\r"

  ".W": "The potential for malignancy of an islet cell tumor of the pancreas is difficult to cytologically judge when one evaluates only the primary lesion, because a malignant condition is usually determined by the presence of regional or distant metastases. Nuclear DNA cytometric measurements have proved helpful both in the evaluation of the malignant potential of other endocrine and nonendocrine lesions and in the determination of the \"aggressiveness\" of these tumors. Thirty-six islet cell tumors or their metastases from 25 patients were studied. Eleven patients had insulinomas and typical insulinoma syndromes, and 14 others had gastrinomas with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Tissue from each tumor was stained by the Feulgen technique, and nuclear DNA cytometry was performed by means of the microTICAS system designed by the Cytopathology Laboratory of the University of Chicago. Ploidy measurements of insulinomas, taken alone, did not discriminate well between benign and malignant states. However, the single malignant insulinoma could be clearly recognized, for it was one of only two lesions in that group with 5N-exceeding rate (5N-ER) values of 1% or greater. (5N-ER is defined as the percentage of aneuploid nuclei with nuclear DNA content greater than 5N.) On the other hand, seven of eight malignant gastrinomas had ploidy values of 2.5N or greater (our definition of an aneuploid state) and/or had 5N-ER values of 1% or greater, while five of six benign gastrinomas had ploidy values of less than 2.5N and had 5N-ER values of 0%. In addition, the two most aggressive tumors had the highest ploidy and 5N-ER values. Nuclear DNA cytometric studies appear to offer promise as an aid in the evaluation of pancreatic islet cell tumors, particularly gastrinomas.\r"

A strategy for perioperative identification and preservation of the ESLN was clinically evaluated after postmortem anatomic observations. These showed that 20% of ESLNs run distally through the pharyngeal constrictor muscle, which necessitates intramuscular dissection for identification in the area around the superior thyroid pole. In 23% of the ESLNs identifiable without intramuscular dissection (18% of the total), a course partly lateral to the superior thyroid artery and its branches implied definite risk of injury during division of the superior pole vessels. In the clinical series, 72% of the ESLNs were identifiable without intramuscular dissection, and 19% of these (14% of the total) were partly lateral to the superior thyroid artery. Only one patient had signs of ESLN injury postoperatively, probably caused by diathermy to an adjacent vessel. Perioperative identification of ESLN with dissection into the pharyngeal constrictor muscle (about 20% of cases) appears to be inadvisable, but identification of ESLN with other courses is important, as around 20% are highly vulnerable during division of the superior thyroid artery and its branches.\r"

The numbers of patients responding to treatment, the magnitude of the response, and the duration of palliation were similar in the two groups; significantly more treatment sessions, however, were required during each course of treatment under local anaesthesia. This advantage of general anaesthesia was thought to arise from the ability to continue treatment for longer and with greater efficiency. The use of the rigid bronchoscope with jet ventilation under general anaesthesia was also thought to provide better control of the airway and to allow more efficient clearance of blood and mucus. Two operative deaths occurred under local anaesthesia, when bleeding led to asphyxiation, but none have occurred under general anaesthesia. Treatment under general anaesthesia is not, however, without risk and is potentially hazardous in patients with severe chronic hypoxic lung disease.\r"

The authors considered that 80% had asthma, and only 20% suffered primarily from chronic bronchitis or emphysema. The increased sales of anti-asthma drugs could not therefore be explained by their increasing use in treatment of other respiratory disorders. One third of the identified asthmatic subjects experienced daily symptoms despite regular drug treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids were used by only 42% of this group with persistent symptoms. Regular or short course oral corticosteroids, with or without inhaled steroids, had been required by 49%. All patients with domiciliary nebulisers appeared to use these appropriately, and most had peak expiratory flow meters. Despite the increased sales of anti-asthma drugs, corticosteroids appear to be as much underused in patients with chronic asthma in the community as in those who die of their disease.\r"

  ".W": "OKY 046, a specific thromboxane synthase inhibitor, was used to investigate whether large pulmonary emboli, like microemboli, cause an increase in thromboxane A2 and an associated increase in vascular permeability in sheep. Nineteen sheep were anaesthetised and had cannulas inserted into the afferent lymphatic of the caudal mediastinal lymph node and pulmonary and carotid arteries. Several days later the animals were pretreated with placebo or OKY 046 0.4 mg/kg one hour before being given clotted blood 0.5 g/kg intravenously. After embolisation in the control animals mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) rose from 12 to 34 mm Hg and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) fell from 4.4 to 1.5 mm Hg; the cardiac index did not change but the physiological shunt (QS/QT) rose from 17% to 50%. One hour after embolisation the platelet count fell from 76 to 32 x 10(6)/l whereas at 15 minutes thromboxane B2 rose from 116 to 560 pg/ml in plasma and from 324 to 795 pg/ml in lymph (p less than 0.05). By 2 hours the concentration of thromboxane B2 was higher in lymph than in plasma. Lymph flow rose from 8.7 to a maximum of 27.3 ml/h at 15 minutes but despite the increase in flow the lymph:plasma (L:P) protein ratio did not fall, indicating an increased permeability of the blood vessels to protein. Pretreatment with OKY 046 inhibited the rise in plasma and lymph thromboxane B2, and limited the rise of QS/QT. The changes in MPAP, PAWP, cardiac index, platelet count, lymph flow, and L:P protein ratio, however, were no different from those in untreated sheep. These results indicate that a large pulmonary embolus leads to an increase in plasma and lung lymph thromboxane A2, which moderates the rise in QS/QT in part but not the increase in vascular permeability.\r"

  ".W": "A compact electronic spirometer, the turbine pocket spirometer, which measures the FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in a single expiration, was compared with the Vitalograph and the Wright peak flow meter in 99 subjects (FEV1 range 0.40-5.50 litres; FVC 0.58-6.48 l; PEF 40-650 l min-1). The mean differences between the machines were small--0.05 l for FEV1, 0.05 l for FVC, and 11.6 l min-1 for PEF, with the limits of agreement at +/- 0.25 l, +/- 0.48 l, and +/- 52.2 l min-1 respectively. The wide limits of agreement for the PEF comparison were probably because of the difference in the technique of blowing: a fast, long blow was used for the pocket spirometer and a short, sharp one for the Wright peak flow meter. The FEV1 and FVC showed a proportional bias of around 4-5% in favour of the Vitalograph. The repeatability coefficient for the pocket spirometer FEV1 was 0.18 l, for FVC 0.22 l, and for PEF 31 l min-1. These compared well with the repeatability coefficients of the Vitalograph and the Wright peak flow meter, which gave values of 0.18 l, 0.28 l, and 27 l min-1 respectively. At flow rates of over 600 l min-1 the resistance of the pocket spirometer marginally exceeded the American Thoracic Society recommendations. The machine is easy to operate and portable, and less expensive than the Vitalograph and Wright peak flow meter combined. It can be recommended for general use.\r"

  ".W": "In a 4-year period, 129 asymptomatic high-grade (80-99%) internal carotid artery stenoses were identified in 115 patients. Because we previously demonstrated a strong relation between degree of carotid stenosis and subsequent development of ipsilateral related events (stroke, transient ischemic attack, and carotid occlusion), we changed our previous policy and began to offer carotid endarterectomy to good surgical risk patients referred to us with asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis. A total of 56 carotid endarterectomies were performed while 73 lesions were followed nonoperatively. Operated and nonoperated groups were similar with regard to age, prevalence of hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes, and aspirin use. Life table analysis to 24 months revealed a higher rate of stroke (19 vs. 4%, p = 0.08), transient focal neurologic deficits (28 vs. 5%, p = 0.008), and carotid occlusion (29 vs. 0%, p = 0.003) in the nonoperated group. Eight of the 9 strokes in the nonoperated group occurred within 9 months of diagnosis of the high-grade lesion; none were preceded by a transient ischemic attack. There was 1 perioperative stroke (1.8%) but no in-hospital operative deaths and no difference in the late death rates of the two groups. This suggests that the preservation of neurologic status in patients with asymptomatic high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis can be improved by carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Forty-three percent had a neurologic prodrome 2 days to 18 months (median 17 days) prior to discovery of the mycotic aneurysm. A focal deficit consistent with embolism was the most common prodrome (23%). However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of neurologic symptoms between patients with and without mycotic aneurysm. During an average follow-up of 40 months, there were no instances of subarachnoid hemorrhage/mycotic aneurysm among 121 patients discharged after a full course of antibiotic therapy. Therefore, the risk of rupture of an unsuspected mycotic aneurysm following a full course of antibiotics is low. When a prodrome does precede a mycotic aneurysm, it most often is a focal deficit consistent with embolism. We favor angiography in all patients with infective endocarditis who experience a focal deficit with good recovery. The timing and other indications for angiography in infective endocarditis are discussed.\r"

Referrals were actively solicited from general physicians as well as neurologists in the area. The diagnosis was based on computed tomography (CT). Secondary deteriorations were analyzed clinically and with serial CT scanning. Outcome was assessed 3 months after SAH. There were no relevant differences between the analyses of patients with and without an aneurysm confirmed by angiography or autopsy. One third of the patients either died within 1 day (12%) or remained in a poor clinical condition that precluded surgery (22%). One third were in good clinical condition, but contraindications to surgery were judged present or serious complications occurred before surgery could be performed. One third of all patients underwent surgery. Overall mortality in our series was 52%; only 26% made a good recovery. The risk of rebleeding was not related to the patients' initial clinical condition, but all other intracranial complications occurred significantly more often in patients graded poor compared with patients in good clinical condition. The most important causes of death and severe disability were hemorrhage (16%), recurrent hemorrhage (18%), and delayed cerebral ischemia (15%). The most important surgical complication was delayed deterioration caused by ischemia (20% of operated patients). We estimated that recognition of 'warning leaks,' surgery in patients over 65, and improvement of our surgical technique could decrease mortality from 52% to approximately 41%.\r"

Our goal was to test the hypothesis that dietary treatment of atherosclerosis reverses the augmented cerebral vasoconstrictor response to serotonin. We studied normal cynomolgus monkeys, atherosclerotic monkeys, and atherosclerotic monkeys that were fed a normal (regression) diet for 18 months. Morphometric studies indicated that the regression diet reduced intimal area in the carotid arteries by about 50-75%. Cerebral blood flow was measured with microspheres, and microvascular pressure was measured with a micropipette in pial arteries that were approximately 300 micron in diameter. Values for cerebral blood flow and arteriolar pressure were used to calculate resistance of large cerebral arteries (greater than 300 micron diameter). Infusion of serotonin produced a modest increase in the resistance of large cerebral arteries in normal monkeys. Vasoconstrictor responses to serotonin were increased more than fivefold in atherosclerotic monkeys. The major finding of the study is that dietary treatment of atherosclerosis abolishes augmented cerebral responses to serotonin.\r"

There was a significant increase in CBF in patients with NPH, which was confirmed by the favorable outcome of 88% of patients shunted. The majority of patients with senile and presenile dementia showed a decrease or no change in CBF after CSF removal. It is suggested that although changes in CBF and clinical symptoms of NPH may have the same cause, i.e., changes in the cerebral intraparenchymal pressure, there is no simple direct relation between these two events.

There was a significant covariation between motor function and self-care ability and between low-order perception and orientation function. Low-order and high-order perception covaried only weakly. Discriminant analyses showed that the actual level of self-care proficiency could be correctly predicted in 70% of the cases by the 4 indexes of motor function, low-order perception, high-order perception, and orientation. The dominating predictor was motor function, and the next highest was high-order perception. When a program for early training is designed with the aim to alleviate long-term self-care disability after stroke, correct assessment of motor and perceptual functions in the individual stroke patient is essential.\r"

Clusters of asymptomatic \"expanding\" lacunes, due to dilatation of the perivascular spaces, were found in both dentate nuclei. These cavities, which presented as space-occupying lesions, were surrounded by a single layer of flattened cells and contained 1 or more sections of normal-looking arterioles. Such a topographic grouping of lacunes in the dentate nucleus has not been described previously. The mechanism of widening of the perivascular compartment remains unclear; its occurrence in a hypertensive patient and its association with typical Binswanger's subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy and severe atherosclerosis with multiple infarcts suggest a common pathophysiologic mechanism possibly including an alteration of the blood-brain barrier.\r"

Fourteen patients with AF (48%) had abnormal CT scans with areas of low density with sharp demarcation from surrounding tissue compared with 8 patients in sinus rhythm (28%) (p greater than 0.10). However, the number of abnormal areas with apparent tissue loss was significantly higher in the AF group (39 lesions) compared with the control group (16 lesions) (p = 0.033). The lesions were mainly located in the cortex with no significant difference in lesion size between AF patients and controls. The abnormal areas probably reflected small, clinically silent infarcts. We conclude that these lesions are present in AF patients without history of cerebrovascular events and occur more frequently than in controls without atrial fibrillation.\r"

Intravenous administration of the photosensitizing dye rose bengal and intense focal illumination of the brain produced a deep cortical infarction that resulted from singlet oxygen-induced peroxidative injury to the endothelial membrane, subsequent platelet adhesion, and eventual thrombus formation. The infarct size was calculated from area measurements on consecutive histologic sections prepared from the brain cortex 4 hours after the onset of the insult. Oral treatment with 40 mg/kg flunarizine 3 hours before photoexcitation resulted in a significant reduction of the median infarct size from 11.75 mm3 in the untreated group to 6.40 mm3 in the treated group (n = 13, p less than 0.001). At this dose, flunarizine had no effect on systemic blood pressure. In a separate experiment the area of thrombotic obstruction was quantified 30 minutes after the onset of light exposure. Flunarizine did not significantly reduce early thrombus formation (2.28 mm3 in the untreated and 1.78 mm3 in the treated group) (n = 12, p = 0.2). The infarcted area at 4 hours was considerably larger than the initial thrombotic area. Protection with flunarizine against development of cortical infarction has been unequivocally shown. Although some effect may already be present at the early stage of lesion formation, the major protective action admittedly occurred in the later postinsult period when the lesion was expanding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Regional rates of incorporation of plasma palmitate into the hippocampus and other regions of the anterior circulation were determined relative to the mean rate of incorporation into regions of the posterior circulation using quantitative autoradiography and a ratio method of analysis. One day after bilateral carotid occlusion, relative palmitate incorporation was elevated significantly by 16% in the CA4 pyramidal cell layer and by 20% in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus compared with sham-operated gerbils. At 3 days, significant elevations of this magnitude were found in the CA3 and CA4 cell layers, whereas relative incorporation was reduced by 26% in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. At 7 days, the only significant difference from control was a 15% elevated incorporation in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer. Histologic examination indicated substantial cell death in the CA1 pyramidal layer at 3 days, with extensive glial reaction and phagocytic invasion at 7 days. Our results suggest that the turnover of palmitate-containing lipids is reduced in the CA1 layer of the gerbil hippocampus but that lipid synthesis is stimulated in hippocampal regions (CA3, CA4, dentate gyrus) affected by but recovering from transient bilateral carotid occlusion.\r"

Moreover, the rates of change in regional spinal and epidural blood flows were almost the same in response to both PaCO2 and blood pressure. These results suggest that both regional spinal and epidural blood flow are regulated by a similar mechanism and suggest that regional spinal cord blood flow can be monitored by regional epidural blood flow.\r"

Thus, the TTC border accurately localizes the medial border of ischemic tissue that progresses to atrophy. The lesion border was 1.16 +/- 0.04 mm downstream from the anastomoses, and the mean distance was not significantly different in frontal, parietal, or rostral occipital regions or between the 2 groups of rats. Thus, a small but significant amount of tissue between the anastomoses and the lesion border was protected against infarction after middle cerebral artery occlusion in SHRSP. After 21 days of occlusion, the dorsal anastomoses were enlarged, bilaterally symmetric in position but not size, and without displacement from the anastomoses in 1-Day rats. Large-diameter anastomoses were further from the lesion than small-diameter anastomoses in both groups of rats, thus indicating that protection is greater near large anastomoses than near small ones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Corticomotor evoked potentials have recently been used in experimental animals and patients as a measure of neurologic function after stroke. However, little is known about the fundamental electrophysiologic properties contributing to the formation of these potentials. To define some of these properties, corticomotor evoked potentials were recorded from the contralateral hindlimb in response to transcortical stimulation in cats anesthetized with halothane. These potentials were obtained hourly for 6 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Four major identifiable components were recorded in control responses. Immediately after infarction, all component amplitudes were significantly attenuated. However, after approximately 5 hours, the early latency components exceeded control values; late latency components were also increased. Corresponding somatosensory evoked potentials were abolished and did not return throughout the recording session. Based on classic neurophysiologic studies, the amplitude increment can be explained as combined activation of low-threshold brainstem facilitatory centers and/or direct activation of subcortical axonal pathways. With further study, corticomotor evoked potentials may be a valuable adjunct to current electrophysiologic monitoring techniques, particularly with regard to defining the extent and location of an infarct, as well as to assessing functional recovery.\r"

The posterior rCBF asymmetries, consistent with the site of activation of many migraine attacks, may be related to more labile control of the cerebral circulation.\r"

In a first analysis, we correlated risk factors and cardiovascular symptoms with carotid atherosclerosis. Univariate analysis showed that relations between many continuous risk factors and carotid atherosclerosis were graded and consistent for men and women. Multivariate analysis identified 6 significant variables (age, hypertension, pack-years smoked, and inversely, plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and uric acid, and Framingham Type A score) that together accounted for 35% of the variability in extent of carotid atherosclerosis. In a second multivariate analysis, addition of coronary status (presence or absence of coronary stenosis as evaluated by coronary angiography) to the roster of candidate independent variables produced a new equation that accounted for an additional 5% of the variability in carotid atherosclerosis extent. Although much of the variability in extent of carotid atherosclerosis remains unexplained, these data define an association between coronary and carotid atherosclerosis that depends partly on shared exposure of both arteries to the same risk factors. They are also consistent with the concept that as yet undiscovered risk factors and/or genetic (e.g., arterial wall) factors common to both arterial beds also contribute to the relation between coronary and carotid atherosclerosis in human beings.\r"

This incidence was higher (2.5%) in patients investigated for cerebrovascular disease, but the difference was not significant. In addition, 1.8% of the patients suffered ischemia (0.3% permanent) between 24 and 72 hours after angiography. Cerebral ischemic events occurred as a recurrence or worsening of a preexisting phenomenon. twice as often as de novo. All permanent ischemia was a worsening of a preexisting phenomenon. There was a significant increase in the incidence of neurologic events between 0 and 24 hours when the procedure lasted longer than 60 minutes and when there was systolic hypertension. Trends toward higher incidence were noted with the use of increased volume of contrast, with increased serum creatinine, when transient ischemic attacks or stroke were the indications, and when 3 or more catheters were used. The incidence of neurologic events between 24 and 72 hours increased significantly with the increase in the amount of contrast used, with age, and with diabetes. The occurrence of nonneurologic events (mostly hematomas) was significantly increased by multiple factors. This study shows that events can and do occur beyond the usual observation period of 24 hours but confirms the low risk of cerebral angiography when performed judiciously.\r"

Six patients with no evidence of RBC destruction had negative MMA findings (anti-Lan [one patient], -Ge [two patients], and -Yta [three patients]). Five patients with evidence of in vivo RBC destruction had significant MMA results. The two clinically significant anti-Lans required fresh serum to give a meaningful MMA result. One patient (anti-Ytb) had an MMA result of borderline significance--normal 51Cr RBC survival at 1 hour--but a reduced T50Cr. The MMA we used appeared to predict the clinical outcome of transfusion in every patient with antibodies to high-frequency antigens whom we tested.\r"

One percent of donors had positive reactions to hepatitis B surface antigen, 3.15 percent for syphilis, 1.43 percent for antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi, and 0.32 percent to human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. About one-half of the donors were between 18 and 30 years old, and only 10 percent were women. To determine if iron deficiency anemia was a cause for the small size of the female donor pool, we measured serum ferritin in 50 first-time female donors. Ten of these (20%) had serum ferritin values below normal, and the distribution of serum ferritin levels of all 50 was very similar to that reported for frequent donors in Europe and the United States, with a clustering of ferritin values between 10 and 70 ng per ml. The data indicate that blood donors in western Venezuela are markedly different from those in the United States and that iron supplementation may be indicated for female Venezuelan donors.\r"

AS and, to a lesser extent, ADSOL produced metabolic profiles similar to or better than profiles of cells not frozen and stored in commercially available additive solutions. AS offers a potential post-thaw preservative solution for red cells that would greatly increase the flexibility and reduce the expense of using frozen blood.

It was developed to allow optimal cell collections with less operator effort than was required with the earlier, standard Surge protocol. The authors compared the cellular content of 201 platelet concentrates prepared by Surge with that of 120 concentrates prepared by Autosurge by the same group of operators, using the same cell separator. Platelet yields were similar (p = 0.775) for both protocols (mean X 10(-11) were 3.54 and 3.57 for Surge and Autosurge, respectively) and when subdivided according to preapheresis donor blood platelet counts, hematocrits, and leukocyte counts. Although platelet yields were comparable in concentrates prepared by either protocol, high donor hematocrit had less adverse effect on platelet yield when the Autosurge protocol was used. The composition of concentrates differed between protocols in that leukocytes contamination was significantly less (p less than 0.001) in units collected by Autosurge (3.4 X 10(8)) than in those collected by Surge (5.8 X 10(8)). Operator involvement can be less intense with Autosurge because the protocol includes automatic adjustment of cell separator settings for optimal plateletapheresis. The results of the direct comparison study were confirmed by data from 509 additional plateletapheresis procedures performed during routine blood center operation. Autosurge should replace Surge because the former easily produces platelet concentrates that contain fewer leukocytes without compromising platelet yields.\r"

Forty-three patients were eliminated either because excretory urography was not performed or IVU did not show obstruction. Of the remaining 115 patients with \"obstructive\" IVUs, 21 (18 men, 3 women) or 18.3 per cent, were associated with contrast media extravasation of varying degrees. Patients with extravasation were compared with patients without extravasation by cross matching as to age, gender, and time of presentation. Extravasation patients demonstrated significantly less hydronephrosis, had smaller stones (1-5 mm) usually located at the ureterovesical junction, tended to pass their stones spontaneously, and required less hospitalization and one-third the number of manipulative procedures. There was no incidence of sepsis. The significance and future research implications of these findings are presented.\r"

Fluoroscopy time averaged 160 seconds (3-509), and the average number of spot films taken per patient was 26 (5-68). The average stone burden was 19.3 mm (3-64). Average calculated skin surface radiation exposure was 17.8 R per treatment. Radiation exposure increased with increasing stone burden and patient weight. Stones treated in the ureter resulted in a higher average patient radiation exposure than for renal stones (19 R vs 16 R), even though the average size of these ureteral stones (11.3 mm) was significantly less than the mean. However, type of anesthetic (general or regional) used was not a significant factor. Operator training, experience, and familiarity with radiation physics should significantly decrease the amount of imaging time and consequent patient radiation exposure during ESWL.\r"

Patients were followed for 6 to 10 months or until one of the following clinical end points occurred: death, recurrent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Results of treadmill exercise tests were negative in 13 of 20 patients with good clinical outcome (65% specificity) and positive in 11 of 20 patients with poor clinical outcome (55% sensitivity). The resting echocardiogram was abnormal in 37 of 40 patients. The exercise echocardiogram was negative in 19 of 20 patients with good clinical outcome (95% specificity) and positive in 16 of 20 patients with poor clinical outcome (80% sensitivity). We conclude that exercise echocardiography is more sensitive and specific than treadmill exercise testing for predicting the occurrence of subsequent cardiac events after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Increased utilization of ambulatory ST segment monitoring mandates an appreciation of nonischemic variables that may influence the ST segment. While a greater frequency of ST segment depression has been reported with supine vs upright exercise, the relative false positive rate in both positions is not known. Thus, we compared the frequency of exercise ECG abnormalities during upright and supine bicycle exercise in two groups--17 normals and 46 patients with coronary artery disease. Exercise was performed in combination with radionuclide ventriculographic imaging. Peak exercise heart rate, peak systolic blood pressure, and exercise duration time were all slightly higher in the upright vs supine position (p less than 0.05). Nevertheless, the frequency of positive ST segment responses was more common in the supine position, both in the patients with coronary artery disease (54% vs 30%, p less than 0.05) and in the normal subjects (29% vs 6%, p = NS). The corresponding radionuclide ventriculographic responses, however, were normal during upright and supine exercise in 6 of the 11 CAD patients and in all five of the normal subjects with an abnormal ST segment response during supine exercise only. The frequency of exercise-induced chest pain was also similar in the two positions. Thus, we theorize that nonischemic factors may govern some positive ST segment responses in the supine position. This finding is of relevance for understanding the potential sources of physiologic false positive ST segment responses for ambulatory ST segment monitoring.\r"

Eleven of these patients had a proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and seven had occlusion of either the proximal or middle right coronary artery. All patients had severe angina pectoris with clearly positive results of stress treadmill testing. Preservation of a viable myocardium despite an occluded artery was, in each instance, the result of excellent collateral flow arising from the contralateral coronary artery. The guide wire and the dilatation balloon were properly positioned by opacifying the distal segment of the occluded artery by injection of contrast into the contralateral artery in 15 of 18 patients. Almost simultaneous injection, first into the contralateral vessel and then into the occluded artery, allowed evaluation of the true length of the occlusion. Contralateral opacification disappeared immediately after adequate recanalization and reappeared during inflation of the balloon. These examples show that in patients with chronic coronary occlusion, opacification of the distal segment by injection of contrast into the contralateral vessel seems to be helpful and without risk to the patient.\r"

The patients with proximal LAD lesions had septal wall excursions of less than 3 mm, whereas in those with distal LAD lesions septal wall excursions were more than 3 mm. All patients with proximal LAD lesions showed an IVS/PW ratio of less than 0.4, but in those with distal LAD lesions the ratio was 0.4 or greater. We conclude that reduced or absent interventricular septal motion in anterior AMI suggests an LAD lesion, and a septal excursion of less than 3 mm suggests involvement of the proximal LAD artery, whereas septal excursion of 3 mm or more indicates involvement of the distal LAD artery.\r"

Body mass index (BMI) was used to categorize patients as normal weight (BMI less than 25), overweight (BMI 25 to 30), and obese (BMI greater than 30). Clinical features and prognosis were compared in 658 normal weight patients, 884 overweight patients, and 218 obese patients. Complications during hospitalization and 1-year reinfarction rates following discharge were similar among the weight subsets. Hospital mortality was 13% in obese patients, similar to the 14% hospital mortality in normal weight patients, but significantly more than that in overweight patients (9%, p less than 0.05). When stratified according to age, 30% of obese patients greater than or equal to 65 years died in the hospital, compared to 13% of overweight patients (p less than 0.001), and 17% of normal weight patients (p less than 0.01). In patients less than 65 years, the obese group had a 6% mortality compared to a hospital mortality of 5% in overweight and 8% in normal weight groups (NS). In a multivariate analysis, obesity was an independent predictor of hospital death in the older, but not in the younger patient subset. One-year mortality for patients discharged from the hospital was significantly less in obese than in normal weight patients (7% vs 13%, p less than 0.05), but not different from the 11% mortality rate in overweight patients. Differences in mortality disappeared when patients were age stratified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although normalization of previously inverted T waves in the ECG is not uncommon during exercise treadmill testing, the clinical significance of this finding is still unclear. This was investigated in 45 patients during thallium-201 exercise testing. Patients with secondary T wave abnormalities on the resting ECG and ischemic exercise ST segment depression were excluded. On the thallium-201 scans, the left ventricle was divided into anterior-septal and inferior-posterior segments; these were considered equivalent to T wave changes in leads V1 and V5, and aVF, respectively. A positive thallium-201 scan was found in 43 of 45 (95%) patients and in 49 of 52 (94%) cardiac segments that showed T wave normalization. When thallium scans and T wave changes were matched to sites of involvement, 76% of T wave normalization in lead aV, was associated with positive thallium scans in the inferior-posterior segments, and 77% of T wave normalization in V1 and V5 was associated with positive thallium scans in the anterior-septal segments. These site correlations were similar for reversible and fixed thallium defects, and for patients not on digoxin therapy. Similar correlations were noted for the sites of T wave changes and coronary artery lesions in 12 patients who had angiography. In patients with a high prevalence for coronary artery disease, exercise T wave normalization is highly specific for the presence of the disease. In addition, it represents predominantly either previous injury or exercise-induced ischemic changes over the site of ECG involvement, rather than reciprocal changes of the opposite ventricular wall.\r"

  ".U": "88073872\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiac rupture accounts for 8% to 10% of patient deaths after acute myocardial infarction, suggesting that myocyte necrosis weakens the ventricular wall in the initial days after occlusion. To test this theory, permanent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was performed in dogs. Twenty-four hours after occlusion, the tensile strength, strain at rupture, and stiffness of necrotic epicardium, midmyocardium, endocardium, subepicardium, and the visceral pericardium (VP) were quantified and compared with those of noninfarcted cardiac tissue. The relationship between tensile strength, stiffness, and collagen content was also examined. These material properties did not differ between necrotic and normal myocardium in any of the layers, indicating that myocyte necrosis, per se, does not weaken the myocardium. In both necrotic and normal tissue, marked transmural heterogeneity was observed; tensile strength of the endo- and epicardium (21.3 +/- 3.3 and 21.3 +/- 3.2 gm/mm2) was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than that of the midmyocardium (4.0 +/- 0.3 gm/mm2) and subepicardium (5.0 +/- 0.5 gm/mm2), whereas the VP was substantially stronger (greater than 100 gm/mm2) than any myocardial layer. Similar results were obtained for stiffness. In contrast, strain at rupture did not vary significantly among myocardial layers and ranged from 0.40 +/- 0.03 (VP) to 0.53 +/- 0.03 (endocardium). Both tensile strength and stiffness of the myocardial layers were found to correlate directly with their collagen content: the higher the hydroxyproline concentration, the greater the tensile strength (r = 0.83). These results support the concept that the collagen fibroskeleton is an important determinant of the material properties of the myocardium. As myocyte necrosis, per se, did not affect tensile strength, we tentatively conclude that cardiac rupture may be a consequence of a defect or weakness in the collagenous framework of the heart.\r"

Serum levels of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography during follow-up electrophysiologic studies. Although the corrected sinus node recovery time, sinoatrial conduction time, and AH and HV intervals remained unchanged throughout the loading period, the sinus cycle length, Wenckebach cycle length, atrial and ventricular refractory periods, and ventricular tachycardia mean and return cycle lengths lengthened significantly by 1 week. They then remained stable for the remainder of the treatment period (control less than 1 and 8 weeks, p less than 0.05). In contrast, amiodarone and especially desethylamiodarone levels rose from 1 to 8 weeks: 1.29 +/- 0.56 to 1.97 +/- 0.90 micrograms/ml (p = 0.001) and 0.63 +/- 0.29 to 1.29 +/- 0.61 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.0001), respectively. Because this regimen produces relatively prompt electrophysiologic changes, which then stabilize, early outpatient management becomes feasible before pharmacologic steady state is attained.\r"

  ".W": "The manner in which concealed anterograde impulse penetration may affect retrograde atrioventricular nodal conduction was studied systematically in 12 patients with intact ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction. After the last beat of a basic atrial drive (A1), an extrastimulus (A2) was introduced 20 msec inside the effective refractory period of the atrioventricular node. A ventricular extrastimulus (Vp) was then introduced at a progressively shorter A1Vp coupling interval both in the presence (method I) and absence (method II) of A2. In two patients, Vp was never conducted retrogradely to the atria with method I despite the presence of VA conduction during method II. In the remaining 10 patients, the VpAp interval was longer with method I vs method II; moreover, retrograde block of Vp ultimately occurred at a mean A2Vp coupling interval of 359 +/- 153 msec (range 190 to 540 msec) during method I despite the persistence of VA conduction during method II at comparable A1Vp coupling intervals. Before onset of retrograde block in method I, the VpAp curve took one of the following three forms: (1) crescendo, a progressively increasing VpAp interval; (2) flat, a constant VpAp interval, (four cases); or (3) discontinuous, a marked jump in the VpAp interval before the onset of retrograde block (two cases). Our findings may serve to elucidate some poorly understood electrophysiologic phenomena.\r"

  ".W": "In 55 patients with persistent sinus bradycardia who underwent an electrophysiologic study of sinus node, both in the basal state and after autonomic blockade (propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg, and atropine, 0.04 mg/kg), an atropine test (0.02 mg/kg) was performed the following day. The 49 patients in whom sinus rate could be evaluated after atropine were subdivided into two groups--group I, 24 patients (age: 54 +/- 13 years) with normal intrinsic sinus automaticity (normal intrinsic heart rate and intrinsic corrected sinus node recovery time) and group II, 25 patients (age: 62 +/- 9 years) with abnormal intrinsic sinus automaticity. In group I, atropine increased sinus rate from 53.7 +/- 4 to 87.9 +/- 17 bpm (delta %: 65.5 +/- 33) and in group II from 51.6 +/- 5 to 73.9 +/- 14 bpm (delta %: 43.1 +/- 26). The discriminant threshold of sinus rate after atropine and its percent increase, obtained by discriminant analysis, was 80 bpm and +52%, respectively, with a misleading classification of 32% and 36%, respectively. The overall predictive accuracy of sinus rate after atropine was higher than the percent change in sinus rate (73% and 65%, respectively). These data evidence that the atropine test is not very helpful in discriminating between an organic and an autonomic involvement of sinus automaticity in patients with sinus bradycardia.\r"

  ".W": "Serum potassium is often low after resuscitation from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. We hypothesized that hypokalemia develops after ventricular tachycardia induced by programmed electrical stimulation. We measured serum potassium in 10 patients before induction of ventricular tachycardia and 15 minutes, 45 minutes, and 3 hours following cardioversion from ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia rate was 243 +/- 71 bpm and duration was 57 +/- 87 seconds. Mean serum potassium (mEq/L) decreased from 4.1 +/- 0.3 at baseline to 3.8 +/- 0.5 at 15 minutes (p less than 0.01 vs baseline) and 3.7 +/- 0.6 at 45 minutes (p less than 0.005 vs baseline), but returned to 4.1 +/- 0.5 at 3 hours. Although no patients were hypokalemic (potassium less than 3.5 mEq/L) at baseline, 33% were hypokalemic at 15 minutes and 40% were hypokalemic at 45 minutes (p = 0.06 vs baseline). A low serum potassium was found in several of these patients immediately after the clinical arrhythmia that led to electrophysiologic study, and rapid resolution of the hypokalemia was observed. Thus, serum potassium decreases rapidly in man after resuscitation from brief but hemodynamically significant ventricular tachycardia. This suggests that patients with hypokalemia after resuscitation from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation have hypokalemia secondary to the event. The electrophysiologic effects of post-cardioversion hypokalemia are unknown.\r"

  ".U": "88073878\r", 
  ".W": "To determine if electrical stimulation during the basic ventricular drive train introduces local effects that influence ventricular refractoriness during endocardial stimulation in humans, 10 patients were studied. With a hexapolar catheter with 3 mm interelectrode distances positioned at the right ventricular apex, the ventricular functional and effective refractory periods were determined for unipolar cathodal stimuli of 2 and 5 times diastolic threshold. Stimulation was performed with both the scanning extrastimulus (S2) and basic ventricular drive stimuli (S1) delivered to the same site and to sites separated by 6 mm. The functional refractory period was not changed by delivering the basic drive and extrastimuli to the same as opposed to separate sites (273.5 +/- 16 vs 273.5 +/- 19 msec during stimulation at 2 times threshold and 270 +/- 16 vs 270 +/- 18 msec at 5 times threshold; p = NS). The longest S1-S2 interval at which S2 failed to capture (effective refractory period) was longer by 5.5 +/- 8.2 msec at twice threshold (0.05 less than p less than 0.10) and 5.5 +/- 3.5 msec at 5 times threshold stimulation (p less than 0.01) when the basic drive and extrastimuli were delivered to separate sites. This is consistent with later activation of the extrastimulus sites during the basic drive when the stimulation sites were separate. Thus, with this method of endocardial programmed electrical stimulation, separation of the stimulation sites for the basic drive and extrastimuli does not affect ventricular refractoriness determined by the extrastimulus technique.\r"

Reverse doming could be identified in four of six patients (66.7%) with mild aortic regurgitation and in 20 of 21 patients (95.2%) with moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (p less than 0.05). Fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet was observed in all patients with mild aortic insufficiency and in 19 of 21 patients (90.5%) with moderate or severe aortic insufficiency. In patients with associated aortic stenosis, reverse doming was observed in three patients (33.3%), whereas fluttering was seen in six patients (66.7%). After aortic valve replacement, reverse doming persisted in one patient with a paravalvular leak. Reverse doming or fluttering was not seen in healthy volunteers or in 10 patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. Our data indicate that reverse doming is a helpful parameter for the diagnosis of aortic regurgitation.\r"

Symptoms and signs of atrial septal defect were dominant in the majority of subjects. History of rheumatic fever (46%), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (33%), presence of an opening snap, mitral diastolic murmur, or pansystolic murmur provided clinical clues to document associated mitral valve disease. Open mitral valvotomy was accomplished in 39 subjects, while in the remainder (28 subjects) the valve required replacement. Partial anomalous venous connection was encountered in 12 subjects. Recognition and attention to the associated tricuspid incompetence is a high priority, and 21 subjects underwent concomitant annuloplasty. The overall hospital mortality was 13.4%, with no deaths in the last 22 consecutive patients. The period of follow-up ranged from 1 year to 22 years, with a mean +/- SD of 9.34 +/- 6.61 years. We believe, with other authors, that since the hemodynamic and therapeutic considerations are very similar, both the stenotic and regurgitant lesions should be included in the same syndrome.\r"

Hearts from age- and weight-matched infants served as controls. There were two stillborn fetuses, 12 full-term neonates, and 3 infants. None of the eight hearts with normal or large-sized right ventricular chambers had sinusoids or coronary artery abnormalities. Five of nine hearts with small right ventricular chambers had sinusoids; all five lacked trabecular and outlet portions of the ventricle. Four of these five contained major coronary artery abnormalities: atrophy of one or both coronaries proximal to a communication between a sinusoid and the coronary artery. We conclude (1) there is a strong association between the presence of sinusoids and coronary anomalies, supporting the developmental concept of abnormal persistence of embryonic right ventricular sinusoid--coronary artery communications in pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum; (2) the absence of trabecular and outlet portions of the small right ventricle indicates a strong possibility of coronary artery abnormalities; and (3) this initial report of a fully-developed lesion in a mid-gestation fetus documents that the coronary artery problem may arise early in fetal life.\r"

The diagnoses in all uncatheterized patients were made by clinical examination, chest radiography, ECG, and two-dimensional echocardiography combined with pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Associated anomalies diagnosed by two-dimensional/Doppler echocardiography included a patent ductus arteriosus in all patients, bicuspid aortic valve in six, small ventricular septal defect in four, and complete common atrioventricular canal in one. In no instance was the diagnosis of coarctation in error. In addition, the clinical significance of the ventricular septal defect was judged correctly by two-dimensional echocardiography, and no patient required an early reoperation because of significant left-to-right shunt. Two significant lesions were missed in one patient each: mitral stenosis and aortic stenosis. These diagnoses were missed in patients who were first seen with either profound congestive heart failure or shock. Coarctation of the aorta and associated lesions can be diagnosed accurately by two-dimensional echocardiography. This permits proper patient management without the added risk of cardiac catheterization. Although mitral and aortic lesions may be missed because of low cardiac output, this does not result in management errors.\r"

To identify similarities and differences in their clinical features, we reviewed all autopsies from 1978 to 1982 at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Of 73 patients with solid malignant tumors and PE, 56 had major thrombotic PE and 17 had major tumor embolism to the lungs. Of the 56 with cancer and thrombotic PE, 25 (45%) had the correct diagnosis suspected antemortem. By contrast, only 1 of 17 (6%) patients with tumor embolism was diagnosed correctly antemortem (p = 0.005). Most presenting symptoms, signs, laboratory values, and associated conditions were not markedly different in patients with thrombotic PE and tumor embolism. These findings indicate that tumor PE is more difficult to diagnose clinically and may be misdiagnosed as thrombotic PE. Finally, these data suggest that in all cancer patients, the presence of both thrombotic and tumor PE should be considered because of similarities in their clinical features.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine whether the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is related to the magnitude and extent of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Extent of LV hypertrophy was assessed using 2-dimensional echocardiography in 30 patients with HC in whom VT had been documented on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, and the extent of LV hypertrophy in these patients was compared with that of a control group of 61 patients with HC who had normal ambulatory ECG recordings. Severe LV hypertrophy, involving at least 3 of the 4 LV segments, occurred significantly more often in patients with documented VT (16 of 30, 53%) than in those with normal ambulatory ECG findings (13 of 61, 21%; p less than 0.002). Conversely, mild LV hypertrophy, involving only 1 LV segment, occurred significantly less often in patients with VT (5 of 30, 17%) than in the control subjects (32 of 61, 52%; p less than 0.001). Moderate LV hypertrophy, involving 2 of the 4 LV segments, occurred about as frequently in patients with VT (9 of 30, 30%) as in patients with normal ambulatory ECG findings (16 of 61, 26%; p greater than 0.05). In addition, the LV wall thickness index, a quantitative measure of overall extent of LV hypertrophy, was also significantly higher (thereby indicating a greater magnitude of hypertrophy) in patients with documented VT (72 +/- 17 mm) than in those with normal ambulatory ECG recordings (61 +/- 14 mm; p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aortic regurgitation (AR) has been reported sporadically in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) but neither its frequency nor severity has been determined. Thirty-one consecutive patients with HC were evaluated by Doppler echocardiography over a 2-year period. Twenty-nine had echocardiographically normal aortic cusps and participated in the study; 2 had calcified aortic valves and were excluded. AR of grade I to grade II severity was demonstrated in 9 of 29 (31%) patients. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (n = 9) with AR and group 2 (n = 20) without AR. Group 1 patients were significantly older than group 2 patients (73 +/- 7 vs 60 +/- 17 years, p less than 0.05) and had larger end-diastolic (4.5 +/- 0.5 vs 4.0 +/- 0.7 cm, p less than 0.01) and end-systolic (2.7 +/- 0.4 vs 2.3 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.02) left ventricular dimensions. Left ventricular wall thickness, degree of asymmetric septal hypertrophy and left ventricular fractional shortening were similar in the 2 groups. Mitral regurgitation was more common in group 1 (100% vs 35%, p less than 0.005), although there were no differences in left atrial size between the 2 groups. The HC patients were compared with a control group of 23 normal subjects of similar age. There was no mitral regurgitation or AR in the normal subjects. Thus, nearly one-third of patients with HC had mild AR by Doppler. The AR most probably results from high-velocity systolic blood flow causing microscopic damage to the valve cusps.\r"

Only 1 patient had a shunt before total correction that was performed at a mean age of 3.5 years, (range 0.3 to 8). At cardiac catheterization the following indexed LV parameters were measured: end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, wall mass, ejection fraction, stroke volume and end-diastolic and end-systolic pressures and stresses. The rate-corrected mean velocity of fiber shortening was calculated. LV diastolic operant chamber stiffness and myocardial stiffness were calculated from simultaneous diastolic pressures and volumes in mid- and late diastole using monoexponential formulas. The 2 groups were compared by unpaired t tests. The tetralogy group had higher mean end-diastolic (93 vs 74 ml/m2), end-systolic (29 vs 19 ml/m2) and stroke (64 vs 55 ml/m2) volumes than controls. Rate-corrected mean velocity of fiber shortening was lower in the tetralogy group (1.07 vs 1.24). Myocardial stiffness was higher in the tetralogy group (16 vs 11). Other indexes were not significantly different. Thus, LV function after total correction of tetralogy of Fallot may be abnormal with larger than normal LV size, decreased contractile function and increased myocardial stiffness.\r"

This procedure demonstrated proximal PA thrombosis in 8 patients (group 2). These patients had a distinctive hemodynamic profile, consisting primarily of significant PA hypertension. None of the 11 patients with normal angiograms (group 1) had severe PA hypertension (p less than 0.0001). Proximal PA thrombosis appears to be the major factor in the development and progression of PA hypertension in adult patients with ostium secundum ASD. Pulmonary angiography should be undertaken in all adult patients with ostium secundum ASD who have at least moderate PA hypertension. Long-term anticoagulation is advocated for patients with PA thrombosis irrespective of a decision for surgical intervention.\r"

The findings were correlated with the arrangement of the thoracic-abdominal organs. A solitary spleen was found in 3 and double spleens in 2 hearts (the remaining 17 hearts had multiple spleens) but left bronchial isomerism existed in all hearts in which bronchial arrangement could be determined. The heart was in the left chest in 14 cases, in the right chest in 5 and midline in 3. The apex pointed to the left in 18 hearts while in 4 hearts it pointed to the right. Fifteen hearts had a biventricular and ambiguous AV connection, 3 hearts had an absent left AV connection and 4 had double-inlet connection via a common valve (to the left ventricle in 3 and the right ventricle in 1). The VA connection was concordant in 14 hearts, discordant in 1, double outlet from the right ventricle in 4, double outlet from a solitary indeterminate ventricle in 1 and single outlet from the right ventricle through a pulmonary trunk with aortic atresia in 2 hearts. Superior caval veins were present bilaterally in 13 hearts. There was interruption of the infrahepatic inferior caval vein with azygos or hemiazygos continuation in 19 hearts while in 3 hearts the inferior caval vein continued upwards to drain into the right-sided morphologically left atrium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-eight patients with malignant pericardial effusion were seen from 1979 to 1986. A Kifa catheter was inserted into the pericardial sac and allowed to drain for 12 to 24 hours during electrocardiographic monitoring. Lidocaine hydrochloride, 100 mg, was instilled intrapericardially, followed by tetracycline hydrochloride, 500 to 1,000 mg, in 20 ml of normal saline solution. The catheter was clamped for 1 to 2 hours and then reopened. This procedure was repeated daily until the net drainage was less than 25 ml/24 hours. There were 22 male and 36 female patients (median age 58 years). The primary malignancy included lung (27 patients), breast (16 patients), stomach (3 patients), adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (7 patients), mesothelioma (2 patients) and chronic granulocytic leukemia, ovary and lymphoma (1 patient each). Fifty-six patients received 1 to 5 tetracycline instillations. In 1 patient, the catheter could not be inserted and in another, clotting occurred within the catheter before injection of tetracycline. Complications included transient atrial arrhythmias (5 patients), pain after injection (9 patients) and temperature higher than 37.5 degrees C (5 patients). One patient had a cardiac arrest during pericardiocentesis. Forty-three patients (74%) had control of their effusions for longer than 30 days (median survival 168 days, range 30 to 1,149+), and 5 patients (9%) died before 30 days without effusion. Eight patients (14%) did not achieve control. One declined further therapy after 1 instillation, and 3 died within 6 days with progressive malignancy. One patient had persistent drainage after 3 instillations, and 3 had reaccumulation of fluid 2, 6 and 27 days after catheter removal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease was present in 16,002 patients in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) registry. Of these patients, 551 had a history of cardiac arrest before enrollment angiography. Cardiac arrest was a complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 372 patients (68%). Electrocardiographic documentation of the responsible rhythm was available in 283 patients. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was present in 112 (60%), ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 41 (22%) and both VT and VF in 26 (14%) patients. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis comparing the 551 cardiac arrest patients with the other 15,451 patients selected left ventricular wall motion score (F = 265), use of digitalis (F = 71), impaired blood supply to any segment (F = 16) and particularly to the anterior wall (F = 11) as discriminating variables associated with cardiac arrest. Patients with cardiac arrest occurring as a complication of AMI were younger (F = 12), had greater impairment of coronary blood supply (F = 7) and were more likely to be on a cholesterol-lowering diet (F = 16) than were patients with arrest remote from infarction. Comparison of patients with VT versus those with VF showed a positive association of VT with age (F = 8), a trend toward worse left ventricular function and presence of a left ventricular aneurysm, but no difference in severity and collateralization of coronary artery disease. It is concluded that cardiac arrest is related to the extent of myocardial damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After time normalization, averaged map distributions were displayed at 18 equal time intervals during both QRS and ST-T waveforms from the normal, anterior MI and inferior MI groups. At each time instant, the 120-point averaged normal map was subtracted in turn from the corresponding anterior and inferior MI maps; the resulting differences at each electrode site were divided by the pooled standard deviation and the obtained values (discriminant indexes), plotted as contour lines with 1 standard deviation increments, producing discriminant maps for each bi-group comparison. The most consistent discriminant patterns in 114 patients with anterior MI were observed in early QRS in the upper left anterior chest where abnormal negative voltages reflected loss of electric potentials while reciprocal changes were noticed in the lower back; by mid-QRS, both distributions had moved jointly and vertically, the former in the lower torso on the midsternal line, the latter in the upper back. In 144 patients with inferior MI, abnormal positive distributions were observed in early QRS in the upper back, followed later by excessive negative voltages in the inferior right anterior chest; at mid-QRS, both distributions had migrated horizontally, the former proceeding toward the upper anterior torso, the latter to the lower left dorsal area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 2 weeks after AMI (n = 70), the low-frequency component was significantly greater (69 +/- 2 vs 53 +/- 3 normalized units [NU], p less than 0.05) and the high-frequency component was significantly smaller (17 +/- 1 vs 35 +/- 3 NU) than in 26 age-matched control subjects. This difference was likely to reflect an alteration of sympathovagal regulatory outflows with a predominance of sympathetic activity. At 6 (n = 33) and 12 (n = 29) months after AMI, a progressive decrease in the low- (62 +/- 2 and 54 +/- 3 NU) and an increase in the high-frequency (23 +/- 2 and 30 +/- 2 NU) spectral components was observed, which suggested a normalization of sympathovagal interaction. An increase in sympathetic efferent activity induced by tilt did not further modify the low-frequency spectral component (78 +/- 3 vs 74 +/- 3 NU) in a subgroup of 24 patients at 2 weeks after AMI. Instead, 1 year after AMI, this maneuver was accompanied by an increase in the low-frequency component (77 +/- 3 vs 53 +/- 3 NU, p less than 0.05) of a magnitude similar to the one observed in control subjects (78 +/- 3 vs 53 +/- 3 NU). These data indicate that the sympathetic predominance that is detectable 2 weeks after AMI is followed by recovery of vagal tone and a normalization of sympathovagal interaction, not only during resting conditions, but also in response to a sympathetic stimulus.\r"

The severity of arrhythmias observed at or before peak ST-segment depression (early arrhythmias) and arrhythmias presenting during or after resolution of the ST-segment changes (late arrhythmias) was graded according to a modified Lown classification. Eleven patients (34%) had ischemic arrhythmias and had a greater number of ischemic episodes (6.0 +/- 5.4 vs 2.3 +/- 1.5, p less than 0.001) than patients without ischemic arrhythmias. Ischemic episodes accompanied by arrhythmias had a greater ST-segment depression (2.8 +/- 1.6 mm vs 1.9 +/- 0.6 mm, p less than 0.001), and duration (18.2 +/- 14.8 minutes vs 5.7 +/- 2.6 minutes, p less than 0.001) than those without arrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia was observed in 3 patients during the early phase of ischemia and in 2 during or after recovery. Early but not late ventricular tachycardias were preceded by prodromal ventricular ectopic activity. Late arrhythmias were more frequent and severe than early arrhythmias, with an increased incidence of R-on-T ectopic complexes. In patients with stable angina, potentially life-threatening arrhythmias are closely associated with severe repetitive episodes of ischemia, and different mechanisms produce early and late arrhythmias. Prevention or reduction of the severity of ischemic episodes occurring during daily life in patients with stable angina may be more effective than prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy.\r"

To determine the feasibility of visualization of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and assessment for atherosclerotic disease in this location, 128 consecutive patients undergoing coronary arteriography were evaluated with digital 2-dimensional echocardiography. Visualization of the proximal LAD was possible in 90 (70%) of the 128 patients. Of 45 patients with proximal LAD narrowing by angiography, digital echocardiography correctly identified 44 (98% sensitivity). In 27 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries, digital echocardiography was normal in 18 (67% specificity). In the 18 patients with an angiographically normal proximal LAD but narrowing elsewhere in the coronary system, digital echocardiographic evaluation of the proximal LAD was abnormal in 15. This initial study suggests that 2-dimensional echocardiography is a feasible technique to image the proximal LAD noninvasively in patients undergoing coronary arteriography.\r"

Eight patients had guidewire fragments retained within the coronary circulation, including one with a second wire segment within the abdominal aorta. A gold band catheter marker was retained within a coronary artery in 1 patient. Four of 5 extraction procedures in these patients were successful, including retrieval of a wire segment totally contained within the distal circumflex coronary artery. Bioptomes were used to retrieve guidewire segments from the abdominal aorta in 4 patients and a knotted guiding catheter from another. At late follow-up, 5 patients with wire segment retained for an extended time within the coronary circulation had no sequelae attributable to the PTCA component debris. We conclude that many fractured intracoronary wires with proximal portion extending into the ascending aorta can be extracted. Guidewire segments retained for a long time totally within the coronary circulation may be benign, particularly when entrapped within total coronary occlusions. Bioptomes can be used effectively to remove wire segments within the abdominal aorta and to assist in the removal of kinked guide catheters.\r"

Thus, for example, estimated probabilities of each of the aforementioned 4 categories of CAD are 0.39, 0.61, 0.32 and 0.12, respectively, for HR.BP product of 26,000 beats.mm Hg/min and LVEF of 0.6 at maximal exercise and 0.08, 0.92, 0.77 and 0.48, respectively, for HR.BP of 15,000 and LVEF of 0.4. The graphic presentations of these estimated probabilities form useful guidelines for interpreting the results of exercise radionuclide ventriculography. In addition, specific cutoff values at maximal exercise defined 2 groups: (HR.BP product greater than or equal to 21,000 beats.mm Hg/min and LVEF greater than or equal to 0.55) with a high (70%) likelihood of absence of significant CAD or 1-vessel CAD and a low (7%) likelihood of 3-vessel CAD, and (HR.BP product less than 21,000 and LVEF less than 0.55) with a high (72%) likelihood of multivessel CAD and a low (8%) likelihood of absence of CAD.\r"

However, many studies have relied solely on the presence of symptoms such as a dysphoric mood and fatigue in making a diagnosis of depression. Both fatigue and dysphoric mood are also associated with medical illnesses, and psychiatric diagnoses based on such nonspecific symptoms may lack the specificity necessary to predict the need for psychiatric treatment. To assess the incidence of depression likely to require and respond to psychiatric treatment, 50 patients documented to have CAD by coronary angiography underwent psychiatric diagnostic interviews. Current research-based criteria (DSM-III) were used to make diagnoses of major depressive disorder. In addition, the applicability of a brief screening inventory the (Beck depression inventory) for detecting the presence of depression in these patients was tested. Nine patients (18%) met criteria (DSM-III) for major depressive episode. Depression was not related to the extent of CAD, age or use of beta blockers. There was a relation between depression and smoking. Only 2 of the 9 depressed patients had been diagnosed previously and were being treated for depression. When a score of greater than or equal to 10 on the Beck depression inventory was used to distinguish patients with depression, it had moderate sensitivity (78%) and specificity (90%) for the identification of depression.\r"

Ten patients with spontaneous or inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) known to have abnormal late potentials in the time-domain signal-averaged electrocardiogram and 10 normal subjects without late potentials were studied. Fast Fourier transform analysis was performed on a segment that comprised the last 40 ms of the QRS and the ST segment up to the onset of the T wave as identified visually. The high-frequency signal content, expressed as the area ratio or the peak magnitude, was found to be markedly dependent on the length of the analyzed QRS-ST segment. A change of as little as 3 ms in the duration of the estimated QRS-ST segment changed the results of the frequency analysis across proposed boundaries of normalcy in normal subjects and in patients with VT. This resulted in both false-negative and false-positive conclusions. Similar results were obtained when the effects of varying analyzed signal length or phase were studied using a pure synthesized sine wave signal. For frequency analysis to be clinically useful and reproducible, standards of normalcy must be established for a signal region of fixed duration or the technique must be modified so as to be insensitive to duration of signal sample.\r"

Twenty-four-hour electrocardiographic recordings from 19 consecutive ambulatory patients with frequent VPCs were analyzed by each device. Results were compared with those from hand counts of complete printouts of each of the 19 recordings. For total VPCs, scanner 1 had an average error of 13% (range 0 to 58%) and scanner 2 had an average error of 24% (range (1 to 80%). Scanner 1 had an error of more than 10% for 9 of the 19 recordings and scanner 2 more than 10% for 11 of the 19 recordings. For paired VPCs, scanner 1 had a mean error of 23% (range 4 to 77%), and scanner 2 of 56% (range 34 to 79%). For nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, scanner 1 had an average error of 20% (range 8 to 41%) and scanner 2 had an error of 56% (range 34 to 78%). Thus, when recordings from consecutive ambulatory patients with frequent VPCs were analyzed, neither device was consistently accurate for quantitation of total VPCs. Both analyzers had an unacceptable error for quantitation of repetitive VPCs. All currently available devices may have comparably large errors. This possibility is confirmed by recalculation of the reported data from a third scanner.\r"

The coupling intervals of premature stimuli for induction of VT (considered the outer margin of the echo zone) during step 1 of the stimulation protocol (basic drive at cycle lengths of 500 or 430 ms) were compared with those during step 2 (basic drive at cycle lengths of 370 or 330 ms). The mean cycle length of induced sustained VT was 370 +/- 79 ms. The mode of induction of VT remained the same in 23 patients (single or double premature stimuli); in 5 patients, fewer premature stimuli were required during step 2 than step 1. By moving from step 1 to step 2, VT could be induced at longer coupling intervals of the premature stimuli in 23 patients (82.1%). The mean increase in the sum of the coupling intervals was 52 +/- 37 ms. In 5 patients, the coupling intervals either did not change from step 1 to step 2 (n = 1) or decreased by an average of -40 +/- 14.1 ms. The results suggest that inducibility of VT is favored by a decrease in the cycle length of basic drive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Over a 14-year period, 53 patients received implanted pacemakers to assist in the control of recurrent tachycardias. Indications were: prevention of tachycardia in 2 patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and 4 with ventricular tachycardia (VT); termination of tachycardia (15 SVT, 20 VT); and long-term periodic programmed electrical stimulation with potential for tachycardia termination (12 VT). Pacemakers for prevention of VT were implanted in 3 patients with prolonged QT interval syndromes and 1 in whom Holter monitoring showed a significant reduction in ectopic activity during pacing. Pacers were implanted for tachycardia termination only after patients underwent a rigorous protocol aimed at achieving 100 trials of the proposed modality. Patients with tachycardia also requiring antibradycardia pacemakers received pacemakers capable of noninvasive programmed stimulation for use during follow-up. There were no tachycardia recurrences among those patients in whom pacemakers were implanted for prevention. Pacers capable of outpatient programmed stimulation were useful, and it may be desirable to expand their use. The 15 patients with pacers designed for termination of SVT were followed for a mean of 68 months. Among these, actuarial continuation of pacing efficacy was 93% at 1 year, and 78% at 5 years. The 20 patients with pacers for termination of VT were followed for a mean of 37 months. Actuarial efficacy was 78% at 1 year, and 55% at 5 years. Sudden death occurred in 4 of these patients, none clearly pacer related. Pacemakers can play a major therapeutic role in some patients with recurrent tachycardias. The role of such pacemakers in patients with VT may be expanded with the advent of combined pacer-defibrillators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hypertensive patients showed cardiac dimensions, relative diastolic wall thickness, ratio of systolic pressure to end-systolic dimension, cardiac index and stroke index greater than normotensive control subjects (0.01 less than p less than 0.0001). Pressure/dimension ratio was correlated to relative wall thickness (p less than 0.005). End-systolic stress/volume ratio was normal as was systolic pressure to dimension ratio normalized for end-diastolic wall thickness. LV hypertrophy was concentric in 26% and eccentric in 74% of patients and suggested 2 different heart adaptations to overload: eccentric hypertrophy was associated with increased cardiac dimensions, high peak stress, normal systolic function and moderately increased LV contractility; concentric hypertrophy was associated with the highest blood pressure values, normal cardiac dimension, normal peak stress, normal systolic function and much increased LV contractility. Because stress/volume ratio and wall thickness-corrected systolic pressure/dimension ratio were normal in hypertensive patients, LV contractile capacity might be supported by the increase in myocardium available for contraction, rather than by increase in inotropic state.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the effects of intravenous dobutamine and milrinone on right ventricular (RV) systolic function, 14 patients with severe congestive heart failure underwent simultaneous radionuclide-hemodynamic study. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous milrinone (50 micrograms/kg bolus then 0.5 microgram/kg/min) or dobutamine (2.5 to 15 micrograms/kg/min) to achieve equal increases in cardiac output. Both drugs significantly improved cardiac performance, with identical 24% increases in mean cardiac index (p less than 0.05 vs baseline; difference not significant for milrinone vs dobutamine) and no change in heart rate. Neither drug substantially altered RV preload, as reflected by mean right atrial pressure and RV end-diastolic volume. Both drugs caused similar increases in RV ejection fraction (mean +/- standard deviation; dobutamine: 0.32 +/- 0.09 to 0.40 +/- 0.11; p less than 0.05; milrinone: 0.35 +/- 0.19 to 0.43 +/- 0.21; p less than 0.05) resulting from reductions in RV end-systolic volume. RV afterload reduction contributed substantially to drug effect on RV systolic performance in patients treated with milrinone but not those treated with dobutamine. With doses effecting equal increases in cardiac index and RV systolic performance, pulmonary artery end-systolic pressure was significantly reduced by milrinone (40 +/- 12 to 33 +/- 12 mm Hg; p less than 0.05), but not by dobutamine. Thus, in patients with congestive heart failure milrinone's effect on RV systolic function is explainable, at least in part, by RV afterload reduction, whereas RV inotropic augmentation contributed more strongly to dobutamine's effect.\r"

Compared with the women, the men had a significantly (p less than 0.05) shorter mean duration of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) (43 vs 69 months), a higher percentage of habitual alcoholism (40 vs 24%) and a higher mean heart weight (632 vs 551 g). The male to female ratio among the 58 known alcoholics was 7.3:1 and among the 70 known nonalcoholics, 1.5:1 (p less than 0.05). The mean duration of clinical evidence of CHF was similar among the known alcoholics and the known non-alcoholics (each 50 months). Of the 152 patients, 148 (97%) had clinical evidence of chronic CHF; in 114 patients it was the initial manifestation of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and in most it became intractable and caused death. The interval from onset of chronic CHF to death (known in 120 patients) ranged from 1 to 264 months (mean 54). Comparison of the 27 patients surviving greater than 72 months after onset of chronic CHF to the 64 patients surviving less than or equal to 36 months disclosed a significantly higher frequency in the longer survival group of older patients, of women, of habitual alcoholics, of patients with chest pain syndromes, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary emboli, of patients treated with warfarin and of patients with larger hearts at necropsy. Each of the 4 patients without chronic CHF died suddenly and sudden death was the initial manifestation of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in them. An additional 33 patients also died suddenly, but each of them previously had had chronic CHF. Of the 79 patients (of the 131 for whom information was available) with either pulmonary or systemic emboli or both, 67 (85%) had either right- or left-sided thrombi or mural endocardial plaques or both, whereas of the 52 patients without emboli, 36 (69%) had intracardiac thrombi or plaques (p less than (0.05). Electrocardiograms in the last 6 months of life in 101 patients disclosed atrial fibrillation in 25; complete left (41 patients) or right (6 patients) bundle branch block or indeterminate intraventricular conduction delay (4 patients) in 51 patients; QRS voltage indicative of ventricular hypertrophy in 44 patients (left ventricular in 39 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Similar effects are produced when vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is administered to healthy subjects. To characterize further these responses, serial measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output and forearm blood flow were made in 6 healthy subjects during constant VIP infusion (400 pmol/kg/hr for 100 minutes). VIP infusion caused sustained vasodilatation and decreased total peripheral resistance and mean arterial pressure by 30 and 12%, respectively. Forearm resistance decreased by 65%. The effects on cardiac output and stroke volume were biphasic. During the early phase of VIP infusion (0 to 70 minutes), heart rate and cardiac output increased with only minor changes in stroke volume. Later (71 to 100 minutes) the tachycardia persisted, but cardiac output decreased toward control levels due to decreased stroke volume. Echocardiograms during the infusion demonstrated increased left ventricular contractility as defined by the relation between end-systolic wall stress and shortening fraction. These data document potent vasodilatory and inotropic actions of VIP. It is likely that intravascular volume losses from increased intestinal secretion account for the decreased stroke volume seen late in the VIP infusion period and immediately thereafter. The tachycardia appears to be an appropriate compensatory mechanism to maintain blood pressure in the presence of vasodilatation and loss of intervascular volume. These observations provide an explanation for the cardiovascular findings in patients with sudden release of VIP from tumors.\r"

Twelve pairs of monozygotic and 12 pairs of dizygotic twins were examined. Weight (p less than 0.05), relative weight (Quetelet index) (p less than 0.01) and skinfold thickness (p less than 0.01) were found to be genetically determined, as well as heart rate at rest (p less than 0.05) and systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05). Genetic variation was significant (p less than 0.05) both for absolute and for weight-adjusted oxygen uptake, measured at peak exercise on the bicycle ergometer. However, the influence of inheritance on aerobic power was not associated with a significant genetic effect on the end-diastolic left ventricular internal diameter or on its fractional shortening as assessed by echocardiography. Genetic variation had a significant (p less than 0.05) effect on left ventricular mass, but this could be attributed to the inheritance of body size. These data indicate that cardiac factors are not significantly involved in the inheritance of aerobic power and suggest that cardiac hypertrophy in athletes is secondary to training.\r"

There was no difference in resting RR interval between elderly patients with syncope and control subjects. However, the ratio of the maximum RR/minimum RR (an index of heart rate variability) during deep breathing was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.005). In the minute following cough, there was no difference in initial reflex tachycardia, but subsequent rebound bradycardia was blunted in the elderly patients with syncope. The predominant impairment in elderly patients with unexplained syncope was the bradycardia component of the responses to deep breathing and cough, suggesting that these patients may have impaired parasympathetic modulation of heart rate. Although not likely to be the cause of syncope in these patients, these findings may reflect an underlying autonomic defect.\r"

  ".U": "88074010\r", 
  ".W": "A branching treadmill protocol was designed to measure functional capacity in patients with low work capacity and varying ability to walk at speeds used in traditional protocols. A comfortable walking pace is first selected (2.0 to 3.5 mph, 0.25 mph increments) and the workload is then increased every 2 minutes in 1 MET increments (a multiple of the resting oxygen uptake [1 MET = 3.5 ml O2/kg/min]) by adjusting grade. Nine trained (maximal MET = 7.6 +/- 1.6, mean +/- standard deviation) male subjects (age 59 +/- 7 years) with previous myocardial infarction and 9 trained (maximal MET = 11.7 +/- 2.5) male control subjects (age 56 +/- 8 years) completed submaximal and maximal workloads without handrail support. The measured oxygen consumption, volume of oxygen in ml/kg/min (VO2), was compared with the predicted VO2 cost of treadmill walking calculated from speed and grade. A linear regression analysis of predicted versus measured VO2 was performed. There were no significant differences between myocardial infarction and control regression lines. Therefore, a simplified prediction equation for estimated VO2 in myocardial infarction and control subjects is proposed. Overall VO2 prediction = 1.61 + 0.99 x. The main advantage of the branching protocol format is the selection of a stable, brisk walking pace compatible with age and gait, which may improve mechanical efficiency through impedance matching. The protocol is adaptable enough in design so that most patients can complete the exercise test without use of handrails, which is essential for an accurate estimate of VO2 from treadmill speed and grade.\r"
