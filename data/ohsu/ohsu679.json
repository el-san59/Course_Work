During the cold test the mean skin temperature decreased to 12.7 degrees C (SD 1.94) in control subjects and to 13.0 degrees C (SD 1.67) in patients (p = n.s.). The mean final skin temperature, at the end of the recovery period after the cold test, was 31.1 degrees C (SD 1.76) in controls and 21.9 degrees C (SD 2.78) in patients (p less than 0.001). The sensitivity of the computerized digital thermometry was high (63.6% and 92.7% for basal and final temperature, respectively), while the specificity was 100% for both values. In conclusion, computerized digital thermometry is a useful technique for the diagnosing and quantifying the extent of Raynaud's phenomenon.\r"

Citrated blood was incubated with endotoxin for two hours, CaCl2 was added, and the recalcification time determined. Hypercoagulability was indicated by shortened recalcification time. The recalcification time +/- standard deviation for saline (control) and endotoxin-activated samples from 19 healthy volunteers was 6.55 +/- 0.8 and 5.69 +/- 0.7 minutes, respectively, whereas it was 4.93 +/- 1.2 and 4.55 +/- 0.9 minutes for 31 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (p less than .001 for each).

Dogs were anesthetized and the left circumflex artery was cannulated without opening the chest by using a specially designed cannula perfused at constant pressure. The change in coronary flow due to NPY was determined before and after the systemic administration of the two Ca-channel blockers. With administration of 1 to 2 nmol of NPY, coronary blood flow decreased maximally by 23.4 +/- 7.8% without changes in perfusion pressure or central venous pressure and it became significantly less after nisoldipine: 16.0 +/- 5.7% (p less than 0.02). A similar attenuation in the decrease in coronary flow was observed in the nifedipine study: 23.2 +/- 7.5% to 12.0 +/- 6.7% (p less than 0.02). A fall in systemic arterial blood pressure was observed after administration of both Ca-channel blockers, but it was significant only after nisoldipine (p less than 0.01). Nonsignificant increases in heart rate were observed after both drugs. Nisoldipine seemed to attenuate the NPY-induced vasoconstriction in dogs, and its equimolar potency is about ten times that of nifedipine.\r"

However, the differences between the several groups were not statistically significant. The increase of hemorheologic parameters was mainly due to high hematocrit, fibrinogen, and cholesterol concentrations. There was a significant correlation between plasma fibrinogen values and plasma viscosity levels. Blood viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation can be described by multiple linear regression as a function of the sum of log hematocrit, fibrinogen, cholesterol, and alpha 2-macroglobulin.\r"

A fifty-four-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus presented with painless partial oculomotor palsy of sudden onset. A cerebral angiogram demonstrated a tortuous fusiform deformity of the basilar artery and the origin of the posterior cerebral arteries, indicative of an arteriosclerotic aneurysmal dilation. A sudden onset of a pupil-sparing ophthalmoplegia is the typical history of a microvascular infarct of the third nerve, whereas pupillary sparing in aneurysmal oculomotor paresis is a very rare event. Special emphasis has been placed on the pupillary size as a guide for the indication of arteriography. The many exceptions to this rule suggest that cerebral arteriography may be indicated more often than generally believed.\r"

Dexamethasone isonicotinate (four puffs bid for seven days, ie, 0.5 mg bid for seven days; last four puffs 30 minutes before TDI) was administered for seven days before the inhalation challenge with TDI (0.010 to 0.015 ppm for 10 to 30 minutes) to each subject, according to a single-blind study design. When the subjects received no treatment, FEV1 markedly decreased and airway responsiveness increased after exposure to TDI. By contrast, when the subjects were treated with dexamethasone-isonicotinate, FEV1 decreased significantly less, but airway responsiveness still significantly increased after exposure to TDI. These results suggest that aerosolized dexamethasone isonicotinate may be used in the prophylaxis of TDI-induced late asthmatic reactions.\r"

The use of systemic theophyllines is currently undergoing critical reevaluation. There have been a number of recent developments in the search for steroid-sparing agents and drugs that inhibit inflammatory mediators felt to be important in the pathophysiology of asthma. Most of these drugs are still undergoing evaluation in multicentre clinical trials.

In one male patient, augmentation of the plasma androgen level resulted in disappearance of symptoms. In the four female patients, recurrent angioedema and urticaria developed after initiation of the anti-androgen treatment. Cessation of cyproteronacetate and a change to another contraceptive resulted in complete resolution of the previously frequent angioedematous attacks. The women are still symptom free after more than 60 patient's months. These cases suggest that an androgen deficit due to either hypogonadism or to anti-androgen treatment may be another cause of angioedema. One of the two male patients was untreated and presented with 40% normal value of C1-INH. Androgen therapy normalized C1-INH concentration in this male patient. Functional C1-INH in the same patient, studied before and after the beginning of androgen therapy, clearly increased when assessed by inhibition of amidolytic activity of C1-esterase. The other male patient with hypogonadism had already been under androgen treatment for 4 years and had C1-INH levels in the normal range. In the female patients, complement profiles were normal before and after cessation of anti-androgen contraception; however, the C1-INH plasma levels were higher after cessation of anti-androgen anticonception. These results indicate an effect of androgen deficit on the level of C1-INH in circulating plasma but do not prove a role of C1-INH in angioedema associated with diminished androgen plasma levels.\r"

Her initial CT scan at the time of frank encephalopathy was normal, whereas 18 months into the clinical course of her encephalopathy, her CT scan of the head demonstrated typical ventricular dilatation and severe cortical atrophy consonant with her clinical picture. She subsequently developed Mycobacterium avium intracellulare documented by gastric aspirate culture and other opportunistic infections including Candida esophagitis. Her neuroencephalopathy plateaued with continued evidence of immune dysfunction and mycobacterium by gastric aspirate, despite triple antibiotic therapy with INH, streptomycin, Pyrazinamide with later addition of Rifampin and final substitution of the investigational congener Rifabutin.

We studied AMI because missing this diagnosis accounts for the highest dollar losses in emergency department malpractice cases. Our study group consisted of 65 patients with undiagnosed AMI seen in EDs between 1982 and 1986. Univariate differences between undiagnosed cases and correctly diagnosed concurrent controls were analyzed using Student's t test and chi 2 analysis. Insurance losses for our cases averaged $113,806 +/- $178,330 (SD). Compared with concurrent controls, study patients were significantly younger, presented more atypically, and had fewer ECGs that were diagnostic of AMI. Undiagnosed patients were evaluated by physicians who documented less detailed histories, misread more ECGs, had less ED experience, and admitted fewer patients to the hospital. Preventive strategies are outlined.\r"

In group 1 (n = 11) UCHS induced by incision of three radicals of the ileocolic artery was treated by 5 mL/kg NaCl 0.9% (normal saline). In group 2 (n = 20), UCHS was treated by 5 mL/kg NaCl 7.5% (hypertonic saline). In group 3 (n = 6), UCHS was treated by inflation of ECPD to 50 torr. In group 4 (n = 7), UCHS was treated by ECPD and normal saline; in group 5 (n = 9), UCHS was treated by ECPD and hypertonic saline. Incision of the ileocolic artery in group 1 rats led to a fall in mean arterial pressure to 33 torr (P less than .001) followed by a spontaneous rise to 48 torr (P less than .01) with a mortality rate of 27% and a mean survival time of 161 +/- 9 minutes. Infusion of hypertonic saline during UCHS was followed by a further fall in mean arterial pressure to 18.5 torr (P less than .001); mortality was 80% within 80 minutes with a mean survival time of 35.5 minutes, which was significantly lower than in group 1 (P less than .01). Inflation of ECPD during UCHS in group 3 or treatment with ECPD and normal saline in group 4 did not alter the hemodynamic response and mortality, which were similar to those of group 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, near-drowning in seawater, because of its hypertonicity, may lead to hypovolemic shock. We evaluated the hemodynamic effects of the instillation of 20 mL/kg of solutions of various tonicities (sterile water, 0.225% sodium chloride, 0.45% sodium chloride, normal saline, 2% sodium chloride, and 3% sodium chloride) into the lungs of anesthetized dogs and compared the results with those for control animals who were made anoxic for five minutes. There was no difference in the hemodynamic effects of hypotonic, isotonic, or hypertonic solutions when compared with anoxic controls. There was an immediate fall in cardiac output and increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance, regardless of the solution, which was statistically the same as the changes in the anoxic controls (P greater than .02). Likewise, the effective dynamic compliance of the lungs decreased precipitously, was indistinguishable between solutions, and was not statistically different from the anoxic controls (P greater than .10). The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central venous pressure peaked at ten minutes and then declined gradually over four hours independent of the tonicity of the aspirated fluid. The cardiac output and effective dynamic compliance of the lung dropped rapidly and remained depressed throughout the experiment, and the pulmonary vascular resistance gradually worsened throughout the four hours of study. Similar results occurred with the anoxic controls. The cardiovascular changes that occur with near-drowning and aspiration of water are not dependent on the tonicity of the aspirated fluid but are the direct result of anoxia.\r"

Of these, 19 children (54%) were more than 5 years old, 30 (86%) were involved in motor vehicle accidents, and 29 (83%) had multiple trauma. External thoracic wall contusion, fracture of the bony thorax, tachypnea, hemoptysis, and abnormal breath sounds were frequently absent on presentation. Associated intrathoracic lesions of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and hemothorax occurred in 20 children (57%) and were particularly prevalent in those with fracture of the bony thorax (93%); the radiographic appearance of these lesions was delayed up to 48 hours in 40% of cases. In 34 children (97%), radiographic evidence of pulmonary contusion was present on admission and did not progress radiographically during hospitalization. No child experienced respiratory deterioration subsequent to presentation or required mechanical ventilation for respiratory insufficiency. Pulmonary contusion in children is usually a consequence of significant-impact injury associated with multiple trauma and has a good prognosis. Despite a paucity of abnormal physical findings, children who sustain high-impact trauma should receive radiographic evaluation of the chest to assess for possible intrathoracic injury. When pulmonary contusion is accompanied by fracture of the bony thorax, serial radiographic evaluation of the chest should be performed during the initial 48 hours of hospitalization.\r"

Threshold values were determined for each scale to maximize sensitivity and specificity. No significant differences were found between the TS and the PTS. After adjusting for rapid respirations among children 0 to 3 years old, no differences existed between the RTS and the other scores. TS of less than 15, RTS of less than 12, and PTS of less than 9 are equally sensitive and specific indicators for pediatric prehospital triage. Because of the similarity of the instruments tested, their performances in other areas, such as quality assurance, should be considered when selecting a pediatric triage tool.\r"

We examined autopsy pulmonary specimens on two children who had received intraosseous infusions during resuscitation attempts and found an average of 0.23 to 0.71 bone marrow and fat emboli per mm2 of lung. We studied normotensive dogs with intraosseous infusions of emergency drugs and solutions into the distal femur. Three dogs were studied with each of the following emergency drugs or solutions: controls with normal saline (0.9% NaCl), epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg, NaHCO3 1 mEq/kg, CaCl 10 mg/kg, atropine 0.01 mg/kg, hydroxyethyl starch 6% in normal saline 10 mL/kg, 50% dextrose in water 0.25 g/kg, and lidocaine 1 mg/kg. Four hours after infusion, the animals were killed, and representative sections of the lung were examined with oil red-0 and hematoxylin and eosin stains for the presence of fat and bone marrow emboli. Fat and bone marrow emboli were found in all lung sections, varying from 0.11 to 4.48 emboli/mm2 lung (mean, 0.91 emboli/mm2 lung) for the emergency drugs and solutions and 0.06 to 0.53 emboli/mm2 (mean, 0.29 emboli/mm2 lung) for the controls.

There were 80 deliveries. Twelve women had no prenatal care; the remaining 68 women had an average of seven prenatal visits. There were seven perinatal infant deaths, and an additional seven infants had morbidity subsequent to delivery. Twenty infants required some degree of resuscitation at the time of delivery, including 19 endotracheal intubations. Complications during delivery were numerous and included nuchal cord, breech presentation, shoulder dystocia, postpartum hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, prolapsed cord, and meconium staining. Prehospital and ED delivery were associated with a high rate of maternal and infant complications.\r"

Subsequently, the base hospital resumed medical control function under limited standing orders. Standing orders were allowed for calls that required rapid intervention with little probability of morbidity. The EMS agency conducted a retrospective study to compare times at scene and total prehospital care times before (control group) and after institution of standing orders and limited standing orders. There were significant differences in total prehospital care times and at-scene times between the control group and the two standing order groups (P less than .01). There are important implications to EMS systems that use extensive base hospital contact.\r"

The initial tuberculin test was repeated after 8, 14, and 27 months. Of the 8,934 black schoolchildren initially tested, 5,165 did not react to the skin test, 2,898 had indurations up to 14.0 mm, and 871 reacted strongly. Of these strong reactors, 808 were allocated to four preventive treatment groups. On completion of treatment, the mean tuberculin reaction for all groups was significantly decreased. Because the placebo group showed changes similar to those seen in the other treatment groups, the tuberculin skin test is probably not suitable for monitoring the success of preventive therapy. Differences between skin test results before and after treatment when retesting only strong reactors are caused by a combination of effects that are difficult to distinguish. Assuming random variation in tuberculin sensitivity, the decrease can be explained as a combined effect of regression to the mean and some boosting. The increased reaction sizes in the subsequent Mantoux tests are explained by the booster phenomenon and possibly by reinfection. When using a cutting point for deriving a positive reactor, the chance of being selected for preventive treatment may depend primarily on the moment in time when the test is done. Thus, all reactors with no recent BCG vaccination should equally be considered for treatment.\r"

In the upright position, auscultation of the lungs was normal in all control subjects and in lateral decubitus positions their dependent lungs revealed transient late inspiratory crackles in seven of the 37 (18.9%), and transient inspiratory peeling sounds in two others (5.4%). Thirteen acutely ill, coughing patients, free of prior cardiac and pulmonary diseases, had persistent late inspiratory crackles induced in one or both dependent lungs when placed in lateral decubitus positions. These dependent lungs also revealed increased numbers of crackles in three patients, late inspiratory squeaks in four, and wheezes in three others. In the upright position, auscultation of the lungs was normal in 10 of these patients, and a few basilar crackles were heard in three others. All of these abnormal findings cleared after treatment with antibiotics. Thirty-one of 32 acutely ill, coughing patients with bronchitis, sinusitis, or pharyngitis were free of induced crackles in dependent lungs in lateral decubitus positions. However, placement of two other patients in these positions appeared to have elicited the inspiratory crackles of chronic pulmonary disease and early congestive heart failure. These observations suggest that placement of acutely ill, coughing patients into lateral decubitus positions for auscultation of the dependent lungs may be a valuable maneuver for diagnosis of pneumonia.\r"

Auditory crackle estimations are subjective; crackle counting from time amplitude plots of sound (called time-expanded waveforms) is more objective but is cumbersome. We devised a computer-based system to count crackles automatically. One hundred samples of lung sounds from 41 subjects were recorded using an electret microphone air-coupled to the chest wall. Interobserver agreement in estimating the number of crackles per breath was high (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001), and these counts were significantly correlated with counts made of spikelike deflections seen on time-expanded waveform analysis (r = 0.78, p less than 0.001). The automatic crackle counting correlated with the physician counts (r = 0.74, p less than 0.001). The average number of crackles counted per breath was greater by visual inspiration (8.8) and by automatic analysis (7.8) than it was by the physician observers (5.8). Reasons for the discrepancies include the fact that there are no absolute criteria for crackles and that rapidly occurring crackles are difficult to count by ear. Counting crackles by computer-based methods is feasible and can improve noninvasive cardiopulmonary diagnosis.\r"

An increase of hyaluronan (HA) in BAL fluid was apparent by 3 days after bleomycin administration. Peak HA values were reached on Day 5 and were about 75 times higher than in control animals. Analyses of urea in BAL and HA in serum indicated that the increased levels of HA in BAL, postbleomycin, could not be explained by plasma leakage. The HA recovered by lavage decreased progressively after Day 5 and returned to normal 3 wk after bleomycin treatment. The HA content and an increased influx of PMN in BAL fluid were correlated and showed a similar time dependence, suggesting that enhanced synthesis of HA in the smaller airways is linked to the early inflammatory phase of the bleomycin injury.\r"

Serially obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from noncontused lung areas (in total, 132 samples from 17 patients) were analyzed for alveolar phospholipid composition and surfactant function in vitro during the first 14 days after trauma. The data were compared with those of 29 lavage samples obtained from 10 healthy control subjects and correlated to severity of respiratory failure. In the traumatized patients, the total lavage phospholipid content was unchanged, but there was a progressive decrease in the relative amounts of phosphatidylcholine (%PC) and phosphatidylglycerol and an increase in phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin. These alterations were paralleled by a marked decrease in the hysteresis area of the surface tension isotherm. The decrease in %PC and reduction of hysteresis area were significantly correlated. The alterations in alveolar phospholipid composition and in vitro surfactant function were more pronounced in patients with severe respiratory failure. There was a significant inverse correlation between severity of respiratory dysfunction and %PC or hysteresis area for all traumatized patients. Protein leakage into the alveolar space was significantly higher in patients with severe respiratory failure and appeared to precede surfactant abnormalities in such patients. The neutrophil content in the alveolar space was markedly increased in all patients with multiple injuries however, no significant correlation with the noted alterations in alveolar phospholipid composition or surfactant function was found. We concluded that surfactant abnormalities occur during the course of post-traumatic pulmonary dysfunction and are correlated with the severity of respiratory failure.\r"

We herein report the cross-reactivity of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to EHS tumor-derived type IV collagen towards rat SP-A. Rat lung tissues were processed for the localization of both type IV collagen and SP-A by high-resolution immunocytochemistry, applying the protein A-gold technique with specific antibodies. In addition to the various basal laminae of the pulmonary tissue, the antitype IV collagen antibody labeled the surfactant material found in alveolar spaces and macrophages, as well as in type II pneumocytes. The surfactant nature of the alveolar material labeled by the antiserum to type IV collagen was confirmed by the positive labeling obtained using an antibody to SP-A. This antibody labeled specifically the alveolar surfactant material, without binding any basal laminae. Several control experiments demonstrated the specificity of each labeling. These results were further supported by immunoblot experiments on nitrocellulose membrane. These findings thus provide further support to the existence of collagenlike sequences on SP-A, and further demonstrate that this structural similarity with collagens can lead to some cross-antigenicity.\r"

Lobar arteries from calves maintained for up to 15 days at simulated high altitude showed a 35% increase in collagen and a greater than 40% increase in crosslinked elastin per microgram protein. Labeling of artery tissue with [14C]proline revealed a nearly twofold increase in relative collagen synthesis. There was increased incorporation into Types I, III, IV, and V collagen with an increase in the proportion of newly synthesized Type IV collagen. Quantitation of collagen mRNA by slot-blot assay demonstrated increased levels of Types I and IV collagen message. In addition, medial smooth muscle cells isolated from the hypertensive calves demonstrated a nearly twofold increase in relative collagen synthesis, a twofold increase in the accumulation of newly synthesized collagen per microgram DNA, and increased levels of Types I and IV collagen mRNA. Exposure of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, adventitial cells, and fetal calf ligament fibroblasts to conditioned calf serum harvested from cultures of medial cells from hypertensive animals increased their levels of collagen as well as elastin mRNA. These studies suggest that the increased production of collagen in hypertensive arteries is mediated at a pre-translational level by soluble factor(s) generated by medial smooth muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "Activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) can mediate vascular injury in the lung. This study compared activated aggregate PMN (emboli) to activated PMN that were previously adhered to the microvasculature (non-embolic) in the isolated perfused rat lung. Permeability and microvascular pressure (Pmv), components of PMN-induced edema, were examined by continuous measurement of wet weight, pulmonary arterial and left atrial pressures, and by intermittent determination of double occlusion pressure. PMN that were activated with phorbol myristate acetate and then perfused into the lung formed aggregates that lodged primarily in the precapillary bed, increasing arterial resistance. Although these PMN had minimal direct contact with the capillary endothelium, edema rapidly developed and Pmv was progressively elevated. If PMN were allowed to adhere in the capillary bed, a minimal and nonprogressive increase in Pmv and lung weight occurred. When these adherent PMN were then activated, there was a progressive rise in both Pmv and lung weight. The free radical scavenger catalase prevented this edema formation but not the rise in pressure. In control lungs with matched elevation of Pmv, edema did not develop. In another group of lungs with activation of pre-adherent PMN in which Pmv was maintained at control levels, edema formation was greatly delayed. These data show that: (1) the activated PMN free radical products alone caused permeability injury in the lung because neither contact of the PMN with the capillary endothelium nor embolization was necessary, and (2) increased Pmv does not cause edema but greatly increases the rate of edema formation when the endothelium is injured.\r"

  ".W": "Health effects associated with exposure to ozone at environmentally relevant concentrations are subject to considerable controversy. Currently, no compelling evidence exists that exposure to low levels of ozone leads to lasting impairment of pulmonary structure or function. One adverse health effect of ozone may be to change lung uptake or clearance functions for other inhaled air pollutants. As a test of this hypothesis, Fischer 344 rats were continuously exposed to 0.06 ppm ozone 7 days a week with a slow rise in ozone to a peak of 0.25 ppm and subsequent decrease to 0.06 ppm over a 9-h period five times each week for 6 wk. Three days after the end of ozone exposure, animals-were exposed to aerosolized asbestos fibers for 5 h and examined immediately after or 30 days after exposure to asbestos. Filtered air control animals were simultaneously exposed to asbestos. Immediately after the end of fiber exposure, lung asbestos fiber burden was similar in both groups. However, 1 month after exposure, fiber mass and fiber number were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in the lungs of animals exposed to ozone than in the lungs of those exposed to air. These findings suggest that ambient levels of ozone can impair clearance of fibrogenic and carcinogenic materials such as asbestos from the lungs and represent an important adverse effect of prolonged exposure to low levels of this oxidant gas.\r"

Four weeks later a syndrome of fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and diffuse air-space consolidations on the chest radiograph evolved. An antibiotic therapy had no beneficial effect, and a bronchoscopy yielded no pathogens. An open lung biopsy led to the diagnosis of methotrexate-induced pneumonitis. This is the first report of a case where methotrexate-induced pneumonitis developed several weeks after cessation of the treatment. Methotrexate can cause four types of pulmonary adverse reactions: pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary fibrosis, and pleuritis.

The model documents the clinical trainee's experience by the diagnoses seen and procedures performed during a full year of experience.

In the pilot study applying this model to two pulmonary medicine fellowship programs, several important observations were made: (1) faculty members may not have an accurate perception of the fellow's actual clinical experience, (2) faculty impressions of the fellow's experience often do not correspond to their own conception of an adequate clinical experience, (3) interprogram variability exists, (4) pulmonary fellows may have inadequate experience with certain invasive procedures. These observations suggest that wilder application of such a model could provide valuable information to program directors and subspecialty boards. In addition, directors of pulmonary disease training programs have been asked by the American Board of Internal Medicine to establish systems to evaluate, document, and substantiate those components of overall clinical competence considered essential for certification in the subspecialty. The model presented here provides an accurate and efficient means for such evaluation and documentation.\r"

The co-occurrence of respiratory illness before 2 yr of age and two or more LRI during a single surveillance year was associated with a 20.3% lower mean cross-sectional level of FEF25-75, and with reduced longitudinal change in level of FEF25-75. The effect of LRI on lung function was uniformly stronger for boys than for girls. Of the children with illness before 2 yr of age and two or more LRI, six of 14 were male asthmatics with mean levels of FEF25-75 that were lower than those of other asthmatic children. Pneumonia and/or hospitalization for respiratory illness prior to the onset of study were associated with lower cross-sectional levels of forced expiratory volumes at entry to the study, even when asthmatics/persistent wheezers were eliminated from the analysis (6.1% lower level of FEV1 for a nonasthmatic boy with previous hospitalization versus a nonasthmatic boy without hospitalization). In the longitudinal analysis, pneumonia and/or hospitalization were associated with slower increase in level of forced expiratory volumes, even after adjusting for \"ever diagnosis of asthma/current any wheeze\" (starting at the same leve, after eight years a boy with hospitalization would develop a 5.0% lower FEV1 than a boy without hospitalization). Acute LRI also was evaluated as a predictor of chronic respiratory symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A digital computing technique was used to extract continuous calculations of average alveolar pressure and airway resistance from body plethysmographic measurements during forced inspiratory and expiratory vital capacity maneuvers and tidal breathing in human subjects. Derived alveolar pressures were similar to those obtained using an interrupter technique (linear regression slope, 0.99 +/- 0.02; r = 0.98) and by comparison with esophageal pressure measurements. Studies in normal subjects revealed a characteristic pattern of increasing airway resistance throughout the expiratory phases of maximal and submaximal respiratory maneuvers, with maximal resistance of 33 to 110 cm H2O/L/s at low lung volumes during forced vital capacities. In contrast, inspiratory resistance remained low and constant throughout maximal and submaximal inspiratory maneuvers. Patients with COPD showed substantially higher inspiratory and expiratory resistances. In three patients with flow-volume loops suggestive of variable extrathoracic upper airway obstruction, measurements of alveolar pressure and airway resistance made it clear that two of the patients had upper airway obstruction, whereas the other was exerting an inadequate effort. We conclude that this noninvasive technique provides valid estimates of alveolar pressure and airway resistance continuously throughout both phases of the respiratory cycle over a wide range of volumes and flow rates. It may prove to be useful in the assessment of effort and airway obstruction in patients with a variety of pulmonary conditions.\r"

To determine whether sleep loss affects respiratory muscle function, we compared respiratory muscle and pulmonary functions after normal sleep with those measured after a 30-h sleepless period in 30 normal male subjects. The respiratory muscle strength was estimated by the maximal static inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Inspiratory muscle endurance was determined by the product of pressure load and the sustained time, i.e., pressure-time index, while the subject breathed against an inspiratory pressure load on a modified Nickerson-Keens device. We found that inspiratory muscle endurance was decremented from 871 +/- 61 to 638 +/- 69 cm H2O.min after sleep deprivation. Twelve-second maximal voluntary ventilation was also significantly reduced after sleep loss. Nevertheless, the respiratory muscle strength, FEV1, and FVC were unaltered. We therefore conclude that inspiratory muscle endurance may deteriorate after a 30-h sleep loss.\r"

Capsaicin-induced motor and inflammatory effects were greater in the lower than in the upper tract of the trachea and much more evident at the bronchial than at the tracheal level. On the other hand, no significant regional differences were observed in the potency and efficacy of tachykinins. SP-LI content was significantly greater in the lower than in the upper tract of the trachea and about five times greater in the bronchus than in the trachea. In each single tracheal preparation, a highly significant correlation was found between the motor effect of capsaicin (but not carbachol) and the SP-LI content. Furthermore, capsaicin-induced release of SP-LI was about eight times greater in bronchial than in tracheal tissues. In view of the strict correlation observed between magnitude of motor and inflammatory actions of capsaicin (but not substance P or neurokinin A) and SP-LI content and release, it is proposed that the regional differences in the response of guinea pig respiratory tissues to activation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory fibers might be mainly prejunctional in origin.\r"

  ".W": "Studies regarding O2-induced lung injury have concentrated on damage to alveolar structures and pulmonary vasculature without consideration of alterations that may be occurring in airways. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of in vivo hyperoxic exposure on airway responses to excitatory stimuli in intact, anesthetized rats and in intrapulmonary bronchi isolated from hyperoxia-exposed rats. Using lung conductance (G1) as an index of bronchoconstriction, intravenously administered 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) elicited greater bronchoconstrictor responses in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated rats that had been exposed to 85% O2 for 7 days rather than to air. Further, airways of hyperoxia-exposed rats were more sensitive to the effects of intravenously administered 5HT as evidenced by the lower log dose of 5HT required to decrease G1 30%. Cylindrical segments of intrapulmonary bronchi isolated from hyperoxia-exposed rats were more responsive to the contractile effects of 5HT and electrical field stimulation. However, no differences in responsiveness to bethanechol or KCl were observed between the two groups. The log concentration of 5HT and the log frequency of electrical field stimulation that elicited half-maximal responses were smaller in bronchi isolated from hyperoxia-exposed animals, indicating an increase in sensitivity of the airways to these stimuli. These results suggest that prolonged exposure to greater than ambient levels of O2 can alter airway function; however, the mechanism responsible for these changes remains to be determined.\r"

Previous studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids inhibit mediator release from mast cells derived from the peritoneum of mouse or rat and from guinea pig lung, but not those residing in human lung parenchymal tissue. In the present study, we have analyzed the effect of overnight culture with dexamethasone (10(-6) to 10(-7)M) on the subsequent IgE-dependent release of mediators from human mast cells derived from airway tissue, intestine, and skin. Airway tissue was passively sensitized with antigen-specific, IgE-rich serum during the culture period and subsequently challenged with ragweed antigen E. Skin and intestinal mast cells were challenged with anti-IgE. Histamine and immunoreactive LTC4 and PGD2 release was monitored in all experiments. Prostaglandin E release was quantitated in the experiments using airway tissue. Dexamethasone treatment failed to inhibit the release of mast cell mediators from all three tissues, but it inhibited the antigen-induced release of immunoreactive PGE from other cells residing in airway tissue. These results confirm earlier studies of the effects of glucocorticoids on human lung parenchymal mast cells, but contrast with the inhibitory effects of steroids observed in murine mast cells and human basophils.\r"

Our subjects' mean nicotine level increased from a pretrial level of 12 +/- 2 ng/ml to a peak of 32 +/- 7 ng/ml at 2.5 min after completion of the inhalation. Cough was the most prominent side effect and seemed to be related to irritant effects of the aerosol. Seven of the 16 subjects dropped out of the study because of unpleasant side effects. Side effects did not seem to correlate with nicotine blood levels. We conclude that aerosolized nicotine can produce plasma nicotine levels analogous to cigarette smoking. Cough was a limiting side effect and was presumably due to an irritant effect of the aerosol on the upper airway.\r"

Enzyme activity was determined with a highly sensitive and specific substrate [D-Phe-Ser(0-CH2-C6H5)-Phe-Phe-Ala-Ala-pAB]. Specific activity was more than three times higher in AM from smokers than in cells from nonsmokers (37,880 +/- 2,090 versus 10,300 +/- 1,200; p less than 0.001) and approximately seven times higher in BALF from smokers than from nonsmokers (3,620 +/- 490 versus 515 +/- 165; p less than 0.001). This study demonstrated that cigarette smoke is a potent inducer of cathepsin D activity in AM in vivo. Because cathepsin D is capable of degrading a variety of proteins, the finding of high concentrations of the enzyme in AM and BALF from smokers, along with previous observations of elevated cathepsin B activity, suggests that lysosomal enzymes may cause or contribute to structural lung damage associated with cigarette smoking.\r"

Duration of pain correlated with patient age and perforation rate. Under the age of five, only 17 per cent had symptoms for less than 36 hours. Children with symptoms that lasted longer than 48 hours had a perforation rate of 98 per cent. Associated illnesses including respiratory infections, otitis media, and gastroenteritis were common in both simple and perforated appendicitis, often leading to a delay in diagnosis. Of patients with perforation, 36 per cent were seen at least once by the primary physician and discharged. The keys to the diagnosis of appendicitis in this young age group were history and physical exam. Right lower quadrant findings were present in 95 per cent of patients with simple appendicitis and 71 per cent of patients with perforation. The primary-care physician and consulting surgeon have crucial roles in diagnosing the disease early in its course.\r"

Nonfatal complications specifically related to splenectomy occurred in 23 per cent of patients with multiorgan injury and 18 per cent with incidental-accidental splenic removal; splenectomy associated with transplantation had the highest mortality. The classic postsplenectomy sepsis syndrome was encountered late only twice. In the already sick patient rendered asplenic, conditions heralding susceptibility to progressive and sometimes fatal infection must be considered at all times. Sound indications for splenectomy must prevail before splenic removal since morbidity and mortality follow splenectomy, especially in the sick asplenic patient.\r"

The rationale for the concomitant use of iodine solution and propranolol is that the iodine solution reduces the amount of propranolol required to make the patient symptomatically euthyroid and that iodine administration reduces the vascularity of the gland, thereby minimizing intraoperative blood loss. To ascertain the validity of these beliefs, we retrospectively reviewed our experience with 42 consecutive hyperthyroid patients who underwent subtotal thyroidectomy. These patients either received propranolol alone (20 patients) or propranolol with iodine solution (22 patients) for preoperative preparation. Comparison of the medication doses, estimated blood loss, and postoperative changes in hemoglobin and hemocrit using the Student's t-test, failed to demonstrate any significant difference between the two treatment protocols (P greater than 0.1). We conclude that the addition of iodine to propranolol for preoperative preparation of hyperthyroid patients does not result in any significant advantage over the use of propranolol alone.\r"

In such cases, the inferiorly based rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap, passed through the pelvis into the perineum, can provide a large amount of well-vascularized tissue that may be placed in the defect to facilitate primary healing and allow a quicker recovery. Additional advantages include displacement of the bowel out of the pelvis to facilitate postoperative radiotherapy, and the ability to reconstruct vaginal wall defects. We report a series of seven patients for whom the transpelvic rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap was used to cover perineal defects following abdominal-perineal resection. Although one flap failed, all patients healed rapidly and the only lasting complication was a possibly related small upper-abdominal hernia found one year after surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Unexplained very-prolonged thrombin times (greater than 300 s) were found in plasma from four patients. Other coagulation variables were normal, and there was no history of coagulopathy. Mixing studies suggested the presence of thrombin inhibitors in patient plasma. Substitution of human thrombin for bovine thrombin in performing the thrombin time test resulted in normal clotting times, indicating that the inhibitory activity was directed primarily against bovine thrombin. Each patient had been treated with topical bovine thrombin during previous surgery. In the one patient with a preoperative thrombin time, the initial value was normal and prolongation began 16 days after surgery. An enzyme-linked immunoassay showed elevated levels of IgM or IgG antibodies to bovine thrombin in each patient tested. Affinity-purified antibodies to bovine thrombin from patient serum prolonged the thrombin time of normal plasma. These results suggest that iatrogenic immunization by intraoperative exposure to bovine thrombin is responsible for antibodies to bovine thrombin, which accounts for the prolonged thrombin times found in some patients after surgery.\r"

Because of left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, 23 to 30 mm Hg; ejection fraction, 20% to 35%), all four patients were initially considered poor surgical candidates for renal transplantation. These same four patients became asymptomatic, however, with markedly improved cardiac function (ejection fraction, 43% to 69%) detected as early as 6 and 14 days after renal engraftment. Therefore, there exists a subset of patients with end-stage renal disease in whom congestive heart failure should not be considered a contraindication to renal transplantation. We conclude that some dialysis-dependent patients who manifest symptomatic heart failure of nonischemic origin have a reversible cardiomyopathy and should not be denied renal transplantation.\r"

Follow-up data for a mean period of 60.3 months were obtained for 90% of the patients. Toxicity directly induced by 6-mercaptopurine included pancreatitis in 13 patients (3.3%), bone marrow depression in 8 (2%), allergic reactions in 8 (2%), and drug hepatitis in 1 (0.3%). These complications were reversible in all cases with no mortality. Most cases of marrow depression occurred earlier in our experience, when the initial drug doses used were higher. Infectious complications were seen in 29 patients (7.4%), of which 7 (1.8%) were severe, including one instance of herpes zoster encephalitis. All infections were reversible with no deaths. Twelve neoplasms (3.1%) were observed, but only 1 (0.3%), a diffuse histiocytic lymphoma of the brain, had a probable association with the use of 6-mercaptopurine. Our data, showing a low incidence of toxicity in 396 patients, coupled with the previously demonstrated efficacy of 6-mercaptopurine in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, indicate that the drug is a reasonable alternative in the management of patients with intractable inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the detection of tuberculostearic acid (TBSA) in bronchial aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens is useful for the rapid diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis in patients suspected of having the disease. SETTING: A pulmonary clinic in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Forty patients suspected of active pulmonary tuberculosis but who failed to produce sputum or whose sputum smears were negative for acid-fast bacilli on at least 3 occasions, 29 of whom were subsequently confirmed to have tuberculosis. A group of 13 patients who were having fiberoptic bronchoscopy for other reasons served as controls. INTERVENTION: All patients had fiberoptic bronchoscopy; bronchial aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, and sputum specimens were obtained when possible. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All specimens were examined microscopically for acid-fast bacilli, cultured for mycobacteria, and assayed for TBSA by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring. Only 4 of the 29 patients with tuberculosis were diagnosed by direct microscopy compared with 26 by TBSA assay. In 2 patients who required surgical biopsy for conventional diagnosis, the TBSA test was positive. There were no false-positive TBSA results in the 13 controls, but 2 of 5 sputum specimens from the 11 test patients in whom tuberculosis was excluded were falsely positive, probably because of contamination with mouth flora. Because sputum can rarely be obtained from these patients and may give false-positive results, it is not a good specimen for TBSA assay. Sensitivities and specificities of the test for the other specimens were as follows: aspirate, 0.52 (CI, 0.32 to 0.71) and 1.00 (CI, 0.75 to 1.00); lavage, 0.68 (CI, 0.46 to 0.85) and 1.00 (CI, 0.84 to 1.00); aspirate and lavage combined, 0.79 (CI, 0.60 to 0.92) and 1.00 (CI, 0.86 to 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: The TBSA assay for bronchial aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is useful for rapidly diagnosing \"smear-negative\" pulmonary tuberculosis. In these specimens it is highly specific and more sensitive than microscopy. This assay could be used to diagnose other mycobacterial infections, however, it cannot distinguish among species.\r"

DESIGN: Open, nonrandomized pilot study. SETTING: Three private, university-affiliated community hospitals. PATIENTS: We studied 22 consecutive patients with disseminated histoplasmosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Sixteen patients completed the study, 5 patients died before completing the initial intensive phase of treatment, and 1 patient received a different treatment regimen. INTERVENTIONS: Seven patients were treated with an initial intensive course of 1000 mg of amphotericin B, followed by weekly infusions of 50 to 80 mg until a cumulative dose of 2000 mg was attained; biweekly infusions of 50 to 80 mg were then continued indefinitely. Nine patients received an initial amphotericin B course of 2000 mg followed by weekly infusions of 80 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 7 patients in the 1000-mg intensive regimen group, 6 patients  have survived without clinical or laboratory evidence of a histoplasmosis relapse, and 1 died of unrelated causes. Of the 9 patients in the 2000-mg intensive regimen group, 7 patients have survived, 1 patient died of a histoplasmosis relapse, and 1 patient died of other causes. Thus, 13 of 14 patients (93%) who did not die of other causes remained relapse-free. The median follow-up period was 14 months (range, 2 to 23 months). No apparent differences in outcome were observed between patients treated with weekly maintenance regimens and those treated with biweekly maintenance regimens. Sixty-three percent of patients developed intravascular device-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term, intermittent maintenance amphotericin B therapy in HIV-infected patients with disseminated histoplasmosis is well tolerated and is highly effective in suppressing relapses after treatment.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term benefit and side effects of danazol therapy, and to delineate factors influencing the responses in patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia. DESIGN: Before and after trial. SETTING: Referral-based hematology clinics and the University of Miami teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Data were collected on 96 patients (60 women and 36 men, 45 of whom had had splenectomies) receiving danazol therapy for autoimmune thrombocytopenia and analyzed. INTERVENTION: Danazol was added to the previous therapy or begun as an initial therapy. Glucocorticoids were tapered gradually. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The overall response rate to danazol was 61.4%. Among responders, the platelet counts (mean +/- SD) before and after danazol treatment were 36 +/- 24 x 10(9)/L and 145 +/- 77 x 10(9)/L, respectively, and the time to response was 2.7 +/- 3 months. Sex, age, and the status of the spleen (absent or present) influenced the responses to danazol. In women, but not in men, response rates improved with advancing age, especially in the nonsplenectomized women. This may be because estrogen levels are high in younger women and low in older women and men. Danazol, when given longer than a year, induced remissions lasting for years even after its discontinuation, but early relapses were frequent when danazol was administered for less than 6 months. Platelet-associated IgG returned to normal range during unmaintained remission. CONCLUSION: Danazol is best suited for long-term medical management of autoimmune thrombocytopenia. It is well tolerated, and lasting, unmaintained remissions often occur after prolonged danazol administration. Age, sex, and the status of the spleen influence the responses. When danazol therapy is used, glucocorticoids can be substantially reduced in dosage or withdrawn. Danazol is a good alternative to splenectomy in elderly persons, especially in women.\r"

PATIENTS: Fifty patients started on warfarin for the first time who demonstrated an ability to use the monitor and who had not achieved a stable response to warfarin in the hospital. INTERVENTION: Oral anticoagulation therapy managed using a portable prothrombin time monitor compared with specialized anticoagulation clinic care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the 46 patients who completed the 8-week study, the median percentage of time that patients in the home-monitor group (n = 23) were within a range equal to the target prothrombin ratio +/- 0.3, but always above 1.25, was 93%, compared with 75% for patients in the clinic group (n = 23) (P = 0.003). There was no significant difference between groups in the percentage of time above the therapeutic range; however, the percentage of time that patients were subtherapeutic was significantly greater in the clinic group (P less than 0.001). There were no major thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications in either group. Differences between home monitor measurements and corresponding clinical laboratory measurements using blood samples drawn within 4 hours of the home test were comparable to differences observed between measurements using two different clinical laboratory instruments. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a portable prothrombin time monitor by patients at home is feasible and provides accurate measurements. Patients doing home monitoring achieve superior anticoagulation control compared with those receiving standard anticoagulation clinic care.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 150 Rochester residents who had the onset of pernicious anemia during the 30-year period from 1950 through 1979, and we followed this cohort for 1664 person-years of observation. The observed risk for subsequent colorectal cancer in the cohort was compared with that expected based on incidence rates of colon and rectal cancer for the local population. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 14 cases of colorectal cancer among the 150 patients with pernicious anemia (where 10.5 cases were expected), and 9 of these cases were found after the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established (where 5.1 cases were expected). The relative risk for colon cancer at any time after the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was 1.8 (CI, 0.8 to 3.3). The relative risk was greatest (4.1; CI, 1.7 to 8.7) in the 5-year period immediately after the diagnosis of pernicious anemia; during this period, 7 cases of colon cancers were observed but only 1.7 were expected (P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Although the overall risk does not achieve statistical significance, patients with pernicious anemia may have an increased risk for colorectal adenocarcinoma in the 5 years after diagnosis.\r"

For example, the user can identify all admissions in which diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed, the serum bicarbonate level was under 12 mmol/L, and the length of stay exceeded 7 days. Once particular admissions are identified, all data stored in the computerized record can be displayed. Authorized persons can also request the patient's complete medical record for further study. Over a 30-month period, 530 doctors, nurses, medical students, and administrators used the program to search the hospital's clinical database 1786 times. They displayed detailed information on 30,851 patients and requested the complete medical record 5319 times. In 1389 of the 1786 searches completed, the searcher responded to a computer-based questionnaire about motivation for the search. Responses indicated that 32% of the searches were for clinical research, 17% for patient care, 17% for teaching and education, 11% for hospital administration, and 12% for general exploration. In 58% of the searches, respondents indicated definite or probable success in finding the desired information. We conclude that physicians and allied personnel will repeatedly obtain, view, and analyze aggregate clinical information if they are provided with appropriate tools. We believe that such access to clinical information is an important resource for patient care, teaching, and clinical research.\r"

The attendance ratio can be used to help identify patients for referral to social service workers and to implement rewards designed to promote medical compliance. The automatic rescheduling of failed appointments resulted in 21% of new patients and 30% of return patients above controls returning for a medical visit.

Tympanic membranes from humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, gerbils, and mice were examined histologically. The pars flaccida and pars tensa varied greatly among the species studied. The guinea pig's pars flaccida was very small and had a thin lamina propria. In contrast, the lamina propria of the rabbit and cat pars flaccida were thick. The amount of collagen, elastin, mast cells, and macrophages varied widely. The human and gerbilline tympanic membranes were anatomically dissimilar; for example, the human pars flaccida and pars tensa contained more and denser collagen than did those of the gerbil. The presence of macrophages or mast cells did not correlate with the propensity to develop cholesteatomas. Therefore, anatomic differences among these species do not explain why some develop aural cholesteatomas and others do not.\r"

We report on two siblings with almost identical anomalies of the external and middle ear and no other congenital defects. Their father had similar malformations, but nobody else in his large sibship presented ear malformations. The defects were also absent in two previous generations. We discuss the possibility, not previously mentioned in the literature, that these congenital malformations could have appeared by spontaneous mutation in the father and transmitted themselves as an autosomal dominant trait to his children.\r"

A single incision line on the upper aspect of the vocal fold should be the result. Eight patients were operated on with the present technique. The voice was improved postoperatively in all patients.

Among the differing methods of measuring blood flow, one of the most sensitive is the microsphere surface technique. This technique has been effective in assessing the overall and regional blood flow to a number of different organs, including the cochlea. Employing an in vivo canine model, we injected microspheres into the left atrium. From there, they were distributed and became entrapped in the tissues in proportion to blood flow. We measured the blood flow to the entire vocal fold, as well as the lamina propria and muscularis layers. The results revealed a statistically significant (p less than .002) increase in blood flow on phonation. The increase, however, was due to increased flow to the muscularis layer. The flow to the lamina propria remained unchanged during phonation.\r"

The middle ear space was often underdeveloped. Ossicular dysjunction was often noted in which the fused malleus/incus remnant was found 3 to 4 mm distant to the stapes. A common finding was severe dysplasia of the stapes-facial nerve complex that often made the middle ear malformation uncorrectable. Hearing results were much less predictable than in patients with isolated atresia/stenosis of the ear.\r"

The present study was conducted in an attempt to elucidate the factors that determine whether a reimplantation procedure will be successful. Cochlear implantation followed by explantation and subsequent reimplantation was performed in eight adult cats. Evaluation of cochlear histopathology suggested a significant increase in electrode insertion trauma when there was proliferation of granulation tissue in the round window area and scala tympani. In other cases, atraumatic reinsertion was achieved without apparent injury to the cochlea. The results of a survey of cochlear implant manufacturers and surgeons indicate that electrode replacement can usually be accomplished without adverse effects. Difficulties have been encountered, however, in removing implants with protuberant electrodes and when reimplantation was attempted on a delayed basis following explantation.\r"

Since most victims sustain immediate fatal asphyxiation, brain anoxia, or cardiac arrest, they are usually examined by a forensic pathologist. When strangulation attempts are nonfatal, neck injuries can lead to delayed airway obstruction. If not managed in a timely fashion, these injuries can be fatal or cause permanent laryngotracheal sequelae. We describe a patient who 36 hours following manual strangulation developed acute upper airway obstruction and neck abscess necessitating tracheotomy, neck exploration, and drainage. Patients suffering this unique type of compression injury may present initially with deceptively benign symptoms and signs. We discuss the overall management of these patients, stressing the need for early imaging studies, endoscopic assessment, and continued airway monitoring in an intensive care unit.\r"

This traditionally has been managed by cup forceps excision or by eversion through the tracheostoma with a skin hook and blind resection. These methods often lead to hemorrhage, and incomplete removal in a bloody field. We have used the carbon dioxide laser via a bronchoscope for ablation of the granulation tissue and/or scar at the stomal edge and at the tracheotomy tube proximal tip without morbidity in 13 pediatric cases. With experience, removal with the laser often proceeds more quickly than conventional methods. The scar and granulation tissue are excised under direct vision with minimal hemorrhage. We believe this to be a reasonable alternative in the management of this recurring problem.\r"

To determine the pathoanatomical substrates of dementia in PDD and PD + AD, morphometric analysis of 5 standardized coronal slices was used to identify volumetric changes in cerebral tissue. In PDD (n = 4) there were 9 to 23% reductions in cross-sectional area of cerebral cortex, a 38% loss of tissue in the globus pallidus + putamen, and an 18% reduction in area of the amygdala, whereas in PD + AD (n = 6) there was severe global atrophy of the cerebral cortex (27-29% reductions), moderate atrophy of white matter (10-19% reductions), and 40% reductions in areas of globus pallidus + putamen and the amygdala relative to neuropathologically intact controls (n = 14). Immunostaining with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein disclosed significant gliosis of all four major subdivisions of neocortex in PD + AD and gray matter of the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus in both PDD and PD + AD relative to controls. The findings suggest that dementia in PDD is mainly subcortical in origin and due to neuronal degeneration in basal ganglia, the amygdala, and thalamus. In PD + AD the same pattern and degree of subcortical degeneration is evident, but there are clearly superimposed lesions involving cortical neurons and long projection fibers coursing through cerebral white matter that most likely account for the distinctive manifestations of dementia in this condition compared with PDD.\r"

In all 7 specimens, an abnormal but consistent pattern of staining was noted. In the hilum of the dentate gyrus, AChE-rich polymorphic cells were relatively preserved in comparison to the pyramidal neurons. In Ammon's horn, AChE fibers were lost in regions corresponding to the pyramidal cell dropout. AChE fibers were also lost along the inner portion of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, yet they were preserved within the outer portions of the molecular layer. These findings provide additional evidence for the relative selectivity of hippocampal pathology in human temporal lobe epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "We recently reported reduced activity of the cholinergic marker enzyme cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) in several brain regions of patients with dominantly inherited olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA). To document the regional extent of these changes we performed a comprehensive examination of the behavior of ChAT throughout both cerebral cortical and subcortical brain areas in 5 patients from one large OPCA pedigree. As compared with the controls, mean ChAT activities in OPCA were reduced by 39 to 72% in all (n = 27) cerebral cortical areas examined and in several thalamic subdivisions, caudate head, globus pallidus, red nucleus, and medial olfactory area. In contradistinction to findings in Alzheimer's disease (AD), mean ChAT levels in OPCA amygdala and hippocampal subdivisions were either normal or only mildly reduced. The lack of severe disabling dementia in our OPCA patients compared with AD patients having a similar cortical cholinergic reduction could be explained by an absence of either a marked cholinergic loss in amygdala or hippocampus or significant loss of noncholinergic cerebral cortical and limbic neurons as occurs in AD brain. We suggest that this and other OPCA pedigrees having a cortical cholinergic reduction represent a unique model for the study of behavioral consequences of a more selective cerebral cortical cholinergic lesion rather than a limbic cholinergic lesion.\r"

In 46 (81%) of 57 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy, the limbic P3 potential was absent or rudimentary ipsilateral to the seizure focus and a robust P3 potential was always elicited from the nonepileptogenic temporal lobe. Bilateral P3 potentials were recorded in 6 patients (10%) with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy. In the remaining 5 patients in the group with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy, results showed P3 bilaterally absent (2 patients), P3 present in a unilateral investigation (1 patient), P3 absent contralateral to the seizure focus (1 patient), and technically unsatisfactory recordings (1 patient). Bilaterally absent P3 potentials were noted in 2 patients with bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy. In 6 patients with technically adequate P3 studies and extratemporal seizures, bilaterally present P3 potentials were noted. Sensitivity and specificity of P3 absence as a predictor of an epileptogenic temporal lobe were 87% and 95%, respectively. Tissue specimens of the hippocampus were available in 22 patients (43%). Thirteen hippocampi showed sclerosis, all of which were associated with unilaterally absent P3 potentials. Nine hippocampi were normal (5 patients with the P3 absent, 4 with P3 present). Sensitivity and specificity of an absent limbic P3 as a function of hippocampal pathological findings were 100% and 44%, respectively. Absent limbic P3 potentials in temporal lobe epilepsy thus indicate structural or functional hippocampal abnormality and may add important information in presurgical evaluation with depth electrodes of patients who have temporal lobe epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "A gentamicin resistance determinant of a conjugative plasmid from Enterobacter cloacae was cloned on a 3.2-kilobase fragment in the PstI site of pBR322. Substrate profiles for eight aminoglycosides at three concentrations showed that the resistance was due to aminoglycoside-(3)-N-acetyltransferase isoenzyme II. Insertion mapping by the gamma-delta transposon revealed that the size of the gene was approximately 1 kilobase. Nucleotide sequencing of the aacC2 gene identified an open reading frame of 858 base pairs, preceded by a promoter and a ribosome-binding site. From these data the molecular mass of the protein was calculated to be 30.6 kilodaltons. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the aacC2 gene with those published for the aacC3 and aacC4 genes showed complete homology of the aacC2 gene and the presumed aacC3 gene. An internal restriction fragment of the gene used as a probe in colony hybridization demonstrated the presence of the aacC2 gene in 86% of 86 multiply resistant isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae obtained during an 18-month hospital epidemic. This corroborates our earlier data on the enzyme identification by the susceptibility profiling method.\r"

Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria.

The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared.

The in vivo half-life of the antibiotic was 11 to 16 h. When 10(5) CFU of S. aureus were inoculated at the time of catheter insertion, dicloxacillin-coated catheters kept the number of S. aureus removed from catheters by sonication below 10(2) CFU at 12, 24, 48, and 96 h after inoculation compared with titers greater than 10(3.5) CFU for control catheters (P less than 0.05). When S. aureus was inoculated 24 h after catheter insertion, control catheters averaged greater than 10(2) CFU of S. aureus removed compared with less than 10(1.5) CFU for the dicloxacillin-coated catheters (P less than 0.05). No difference was found between coated and control catheters when S. aureus was inoculated 48 h after catheter insertion, but S. aureus titers averaged less than 10(2) CFU for all experimental groups. Our data suggest that in mice, regional prophylaxis of S. aureus subcutaneous space infection is feasible with catheters coated with dicloxacillin and that the presence of antibiotic is only necessary for the first 24 to 48 h.\r"

Approximately 10(7) viable M. avium complex serotype 1 cells for which the MIC of amikacin was 8 micrograms/ml were given intravenously. Treatment was started with encapsulated or free amikacin at approximately 110 or 40 mg/kg of body weight 7 or 14 days later. In the former experiment, treatment was given two or three times per week. In the latter experiment, treatment was given daily for 5 days. The animals were sacrificed 5 days after the last dose. Liver, spleen, and lung were homogenized, and viable cell counts were determined on 7H10 agar. An analysis of variance and subsequent Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference) tests indicated that both encapsulated and free amikacin significantly reduced viable cell counts in each of the organs compared with counts in the control group. Compared with free amikacin, encapsulated amikacin significantly reduced viable cell counts in the liver and spleen. Liposome encapsulation of an active agent appears to be a promising therapeutic approach to M. avium complex infection.\r"

Animals infected with one of two test strains (SA1199 or SA487) were randomized into treatment groups and received 6 days of therapy. For SA1199, ciprofloxacin plus rifampin was most effective at reducing vegetation bacterial counts. For SA487, ciprofloxacin plus rifampin was as effective as vancomycin but less effective than ciprofloxacin alone. Resistance to ciprofloxacin at 5- and 10-fold the MIC emerged in the test strain in 82 and 55%, respectively, of rabbits infected with SA1199 and receiving ciprofloxacin monotherapy. The combination of ciprofloxacin and rifampin decreased these frequencies to 60% (P = 0.27) and 10% (P = 0.04). No resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in rabbits infected with SA487. We conclude that ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin plus rifampin are as efficacious as vancomycin in this model and that combining rifampin with ciprofloxacin may decrease the frequency at which high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin emerges. However, with respect to improved efficacy, the combination of ciprofloxacin and rifampin is unpredictable and may be detrimental.\r"

However, appropriate dosage regimens in this group of patients have not been fully known for many antibiotics. Therefore, we studied the kinetic disposition of cefotiam, a parenteral, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, after an intravenous dose (2 g) infused over 30 min into 15 sumo wrestler patients with an excess body weight (130 to 220% of ideal body weight) and 10 control patients with a normal weight (90 to 102% of ideal body weight). Mean (+/- standard deviation) clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were significantly greater in the sumo wrestler than in the control group (38.3 +/- 9.4 versus 23.5 +/- 6.0 liters/h, P less than 0.001, and 30.2 +/- 8.0 versus 17.9 +/- 6.1 liters, P less than 0.001). Mean elimination half-life was slightly but significantly longer in the sumo wrestler than in the control group (0.91 +/- 0.14 versus 0.74 +/- 0.20 h, P less than 0.05). However, mean residence time did not differ between the two groups (0.79 +/- 0.10 versus 0.75 +/- 0.14 h). The statistical differences in clearance and volume of distribution between the two groups disappeared when these kinetic parameters were corrected for body surface area, but not for total body weight or ideal body weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixteen infective episodes were microbiologically documented in the vancomycin group, and twenty-one were microbiologically documented in the teicoplanin group. Microbiologically and clinically documented infections treated with vancomycin had an 80% response rate, compared with a 69% response rate for those treated with teicoplanin (P = 0.316). Adverse events occurred in nine (25%) of the episodes in the vancomycin group, compared with three (8%) in the teicoplanin group (P = 0.044).

At 1 week posttherapy, 88% of the patients in the cefuroxime axetil group and 97% in the cefaclor group were clinically and bacteriologically cured (P greater than 0.10). There was no statistically significant difference between the cure rates of the two treatment groups. However, this study has only a 50% power to detect a 10% difference. Therefore, there is a substantial possibility of a type II error, i.e., failing to find a difference that is actually present. At 4 weeks posttherapy, 78% of the patients in the cefuroxime group and 80% in the cefaclor group remained cured. By 36 weeks posttherapy, the cumulative rate of recurrence in both treatment groups was 60%. Of the patients with a positive antibody-coated bacteria test, fewer achieved a short-term cure after single-dose treatment with cefuroxime axetil than those with a negative antibody-coated bacteria test (67 versus 96%; P less than 0.01).\r"

Application of liposomally entrapped interferon caused a reduction of lesion scores, whereas application of interferon formulated as a solution or as an emulsion was ineffective. The method of liposomal preparation rather than the lipid composition of the bilayers appeared to be the most important factor for reducing lesion scores. Only liposomes prepared by the dehydration-rehydration method were effective. This finding implied that the dehydration and subsequent rehydration of the liposomes facilitate partitioning of the interferon into liposomal bilayers, where the drug is positioned for transfer into the lipid compartment of the stratum corneum. Liposomes do not appear to function as permeation enhancers but seem to provide the needed physicochemical environment for transfer of interferon into the skin.\r"

In salt-depleted rats, amphotericin B decreased creatinine clearance linearly with time, with an 85% reduction by week 3. In contrast, in normal-salt rats creatinine clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3, and in salt-loaded rats creatinine clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43% at week 3. All rats in the sodium-depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal-salt or salt-loaded rat. Concentrations of amphotericin B in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study. However, at the end of 3 weeks, amphotericin B levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt-depleted and normal-salt rats than those in salt-loaded rats, with plasma/kidney ratios of 21, 14, and 8 in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats, respectively. In conclusion, reductions in creatinine clearance and renal amphotericin B accumulation after chronic amphotericin B administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by sodium loading in rats.\r"

Six or more patients were studied at each of four different oral dosage levels: 300, 600, 900, and 1,200 mg/day. Twelve studies were also conducted with tracer doses of intravenous radiolabeled [14C]rifabutin. Blood and urine samples were collected for at least 72 h after the first (day 1) and last (day 28) doses of rifabutin and analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The plasma concentration data were best described by a two-compartment open model with a terminal half-life of 36 h. Rifabutin was rapidly absorbed, reaching a peak concentration about 2 to 3 h after an oral dose. Peak and trough concentrations for the 1,200-mg dose were 907 and 194 ng/ml, respectively. Total body clearance was 10 to 18 liters/h. Oral bioavailability was 12 to 20%. The drug was moderately bound to plasma proteins with a free fraction of 29 +/- 2% (mean +/- standard deviation). About 10% of an administered intravenous dose of rifabutin is excreted into the urine unchanged. Renal clearance was 1.5 +/- 0.2 liters/h. The volume of distribution was large (8 to 9 liters/kg), suggesting extensive distribution into the tissues. The area under the curve for the last dose was smaller than that of the first dose, suggesting possible induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes.\r"

Investigation of the antibiotic target, dihydrofolate reductase, was undertaken in both a susceptible strain and a strain with high-level resistance (MIC, greater than 1,000 micrograms/ml). The enzyme was purified by using ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography. Specific activities, molecular weights, isoelectric points, and substrate kinetics were similar for both enzymes. However, the dihydrofolate reductase from the trimethoprim-resistant strain demonstrated decreased susceptibility to inhibition by trimethoprim and increased susceptibility to inhibition by methotrexate, suggesting that these two enzymes are not identical. We conclude that the mechanism of trimethoprim resistance in this strain with high-level resistance is production of a trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase.\r"

To ensure comparability with daily drug replacements in the macrophage experiments, the period of exposure to drugs in 7H-9 medium was kept to only 3 days. With in vitro culture at pH 6.4, drug penetration, measured as the ratio of MICs in macrophages to MICs in 7H-9 medium, was approximately 5 for isoniazid, 5 for rifampin, and 10 for streptomycin. With in vitro culture at pH 7.4, drug penetration was 100 for streptomycin, and at pH 5.6 it was 1 for pyrazinamide.

Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant (MICs, 64 to 128 micrograms/ml). The MICs for staphylococci were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was resistant. There was a minimal inoculum effect and no effect of the medium. ME1228 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and S. aureus plasmid beta-lactamases and was stable against hydrolysis by Richmond-Sykes type 1a, 1c, 1d, and IV chromosomal beta-lactamases.

  ".W": "The in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. The two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. Both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., and Bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., and Serratia marcescens. Clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against Xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against Morganella morganii. Enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. In general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against Klebsiella spp., C. diversus, X. maltophilia, and Bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against Escherichia coli and Proteeae. There was little or no enhancement of activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, or Acinetobacter anitratus. Clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. Tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The influence of daptomycin on tobramycin nephrotoxicity was also assessed. MSSA or MRSA abscesses were treated with subcutaneous daptomycin (10 mg/kg every 12 h), vancomycin (125 mg/kg every 12 h), or diluent (every 12 h) for 5 to 10 days. Rats in both antibiotic treatment groups had lower abscess bacterial counts than did controls at days 5 and 10 (P less than 0.0025). The daptomycin treatment groups had lower abscess bacterial counts than did the vancomycin treatment groups for MSSA at day 5 (P less than 0.0025) and day 10 (P less than 0.025) and for MRSA at day 10 (P less than 0.0025).

Compared with controls, animals treated with daptomycin alone exhibited no detectable nephrotoxicity. Rats given tobramycin alone developed functional and histopathologic abnormalities from days 7 through 17. Animals treated with daptomycin and tobramycin for 14 days had a lower mean concentration of creatinine in serum (P less than 0.005), higher mean creatinine clearance values (P less than 0.05), and less cortical tubular cell regeneration (P less than 0.05) than did rats treated with tobramycin alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These microelectrodes (1 micron at the extreme tip) measured the free diffusible form of electroactive antibiotics in the extracellular brain space. Metronidazole, chloramphenicol succinate, cefsulodin, and piperacillin gave diffusion coefficients ranging from 0.1 x 10(-6) to 0.2 x 10(-6) cm2 . s-1 in tissue; chloramphenicol base, which is positively charged, gave a coefficient of 0.04 x 10(-6) cm2 . s-1. The coefficient ranged from 0.6 x 10(-6) to 1.2 x 10(-6) cm2 . s-1 in agar. These coefficients were used to simulate antibiotic concentrations in infectious sites and between capillaries by using a simple model of plane diffusion.\r"

Their selectivity was greater than that of neplanocin A, particularly against vesicular stomatitis virus and rotavirus. As could be expected from adenosine analogs that are directly targeted at AdoHcy hydrolase, 3-deazaneplanocin A, DHCA, and DHCDA were fully active in adenosine kinase-deficient cells, implying that their activity did not depend on phosphorylation by adenosine kinase. None of the AdoHcy hydrolase inhibitors showed selective activity against human immunodeficiency virus (type 1). 3-Deazaneplanocin A at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day conferred marked protection against a lethal infection of newborn mice with vesicular stomatitis virus.\r"

The purified enzyme was judged homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate gradient gel electrophoresis and fast protein liquid chromatography. The enzyme hydrolyzed phenoxymethylpenicillin, benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and carbenicillin more rapidly than piperacillin and cephaloridine. Cephalothin, cephalexin, cefoxitin, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and imipenem were only slightly hydrolyzed, at less than 1% the rate for phenoxymethylpenicillin. The enzyme was inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam, and p-chloromercuribenzoate. The molecular weight was determined by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate gradient gel electrophoresis to be 32,000. The isoelectric point was 4.4.

Data from three centers were combined for this report because the study design and study populations were identical, and patients were enrolled within an 18-month period. Cure rates for evaluable patients 4 weeks after treatment were high for all regimens: ofloxacin (200 mg) twice daily for 3 days, 22 of 25 (88%) cured; ofloxacin (200 mg) twice daily for 7 days, 42 of 49 (86%) cured; ofloxacin (300 mg) twice daily for 7 days, 25 of 25 (100%) cured; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg) twice daily for 7 days, 46 of 52 (88%) cured. Ofloxacin was more effective than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in eradicating Escherichia coli from rectal cultures during and 1 week after treatment. Both ofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole markedly reduced vaginal colonization with E. coli during and 4 weeks after therapy. Emergence of resistant coliforms in rectal flora was found in 5 (19%) of 27 patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but none of 50 ofloxacin-treated patients who were studied (P = 0.004). Adverse effects were equally common among the four treatment groups. We conclude that 3 to 7 days of ofloxacin is as safe and effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women and that ofloxacin effectively reduces the fecal and vaginal reservoirs of coliforms in such patients.\r"

The interaction of the drugs with a broad array of beta-lactamases was also determined in spectrophotometric assays and tests for enzyme induction. Overall, the percentages of strains susceptible to each of the study drugs were 82% for cefixime, 62% for cefuroxime, 58% for cephalexin, and 44% for cefaclor. The poor activity of the older cephalosporins was due to a high degree of susceptibility to hydrolysis by both plasmid-mediated and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases. For cefaclor, higher MICs were associated with higher levels of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in the strains. Resistance to cefuroxime was seen primarily among strains expressing high levels of class I or IV beta-lactamase. Resistance to cefixime was seen only among strains expressing high levels of class I enzymes. Neither cefixime nor cefuroxime was a strong inducer of class I beta-lactamases, although enzyme induction did appear to play a role in cefuroxime resistance in a strain of Serratia marcescens. The consistently greater activity of cefixime over cefuroxime was found not to be due to greater drug permeation into the cell. Rather, it appeared to result from the high affinity of the drug for target enzymes.\r"

The mobility of gentamicin resistance (Gmr) genes found on a prototype conjugative plasmid (pGO1) was compared with that of genes cloned from chromosomal sites. Plasmid-encoded Gmr genes and flanking sequences were introduced onto a temperature-sensitive plasmid (pRN3208) from pGO1 by homologous recombination between insertion sequence-like elements present on both replicons. Growth of Staphylococcus aureus strains containing the temperature-sensitive recombinant (pGO161) at the nonpermissive temperature for plasmid replication (42 degrees C) revealed no translocation of Gmr from its plasmid location. A transposon (Tn551) resident on the same replicon did translocate. Chromosomal Gmr determinants were cloned, together with the gene for trimethoprim resistance (dfrA), from three geographically distinct S. epidermidis isolates; two were subcloned onto temperature-sensitive Escherichia coli-S. aureus shuttle plasmids as 7.2-kilobase BglII fragments. Growth of both recombination-deficient and-proficient S. aureus strains containing the cloned genes at 42 degrees C allowed detection of transposition of Gmr sequences and identification of insertion into random chromosomal sites. We have designated this 5-kilobase transposon from S. epidermidis as Tn4031.\r"

  ".U": "90025007\r", 
  ".W": "Gentamicin is a commonly used antibiotic for the treatment of gram-negative-bacterial infections. Bacterial endotoxin is liberated during antibiotic therapy, and we have shown that endotoxemic animals accumulate more aminoglycosides in their renal parenchyma than normal animals. Vasoactive mediators, such as prostaglandins and thromboxanes, are released after endotoxin and are involved in inflammation. Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug known to inhibit the synthesis of these hormones, was infused intravenously as a bolus (3.0 mg/kg) or as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion (0.75 mg/kg per h) to rats given gentamicin. Levels of gentamicin in serum and kidney were increased 2 h post-antibiotic treatment in the endotoxemic animals. Renal function was not significantly disturbed. Indomethacin given as a bolus failed to correct the disturbed intrarenal pharmacokinetics of gentamicin induced by endotoxin. However, a bolus followed by continuous infusion of indomethacin resulted in low cortical and high papillary levels of antibiotic. These changes were correlated with the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis from the kidney. These observations suggest an important role for prostaglandins in the interaction among endotoxin, aminoglycosides, and the kidney. Specific inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolites should be investigated to further understand the mechanisms of this interaction.\r"

Additionally, b-FGF is stored in the vicinity of keratinocytes and endothelial cells in basement membrane and extracellular matrix, and can be displaced from these \"buffers\" by various stimuli. Displacement of b-FGF by physical stimuli, such as scratching or rubbing, could explain koebnerization in diseases such as psoriasis. It has been shown that the fungal metabolite cyclosporine A will inhibit the proliferation of keratinocytes in vitro when their proliferation is driven by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or bovine pituitary extract. Since b-FGF may be both a positive autocrine and paracrine signal involved in the proliferation of both keratinocytes and endothelial cells, we evaluated the effects of cyclosporine on the b-FGF-driven proliferation of these cell types in vitro. We have shown that normal human keratinocyte and endothelial cell proliferation driven by b-FGF alone can be inhibited by cyclosporine A. Concentrations of cyclosporine A achievable in skin after oral administration can significantly inhibit the b-FGF-driven proliferation of both of these cell types. Basic fibroblast growth factor may be an important signal driving both keratinocyte proliferation and angiogenesis in certain disease states, such as psoriasis, as well as aberrant endothelial cell proliferation as is seen in Kaposi's sarcoma. The efficacy of cyclosporine A in treating these disease states may be due, at least in part, to the ability of cyclosporine A to interrupt b-FGF-mediated autocrine and paracrine feedback loops acting on and between endothelial cells and keratinocytes.\r"

Three patients were managed with both surgery and balloon dilatation. Twenty-five patients underwent surgical repair with Roux-Y choledocho- or hepaticojejunostomy with postoperative transhepatic stenting for a mean of 13.8 +/- 1.3 months. Twenty patients had balloon dilatation a mean of 3.9 times and were stented transhepatically for a mean of 13.3 +/- 2.0 months. The two groups were similar with respect to multiple parameters that might have influenced outcome. Mean length of follow-up was 57 +/- 7 and 59 +/- 6 months for surgery and balloon dilatation, respectively. No patients died after any of the procedures. The same definition of a successful outcome was applied to both groups and was achieved in 88% of the surgical and in only 55% of the balloon dilatation patients (p less than 0.02). Significant hemobilia occurred more often with balloon dilatation (20% vs. 4%, p less than 0.02). The total hospital stay and cost of balloon dilatation was not significantly different from surgery. We conclude that surgical repair of benign postoperative strictures results in fewer problems that require further therapy. Nevertheless balloon dilatation is an alternative for patients who are at high risk or who are unwilling to undergo another operation.\r"

Fourteen emergency operations were for perforated viscus or peritonitis (11), massive gastrointestinal bleeding (2), and cecal volvulus (1). In 5 of 22 (23%) elective operations AIDS was unknown to the treating physicians until diagnosed by the surgical pathology; in contrast, all 14 emergency operations were in patients who had a known diagnosis of AIDS. The operative findings were related to AIDS in 34 of 36 (94%) operations. Cytomegalovirus was the most common pathogen, isolated or identified microscopically in 11 patients (eight emergency and three elective operations). Mycobacterial infections presented as retroperitoneal adenopathy or splenic abscess in six patients. Non-Hodgkins lymphoma was the most common malignancy found, presenting as an abdominal mass (4), bowel obstruction (3), or with gastrointestinal bleeding (2). Kaposi's sarcoma was diagnosed at laparotomy in four patients. The 1-month operative mortality rate for elective operation was 9% (2 of 22) and 46% (6 of 13) in emergencies. Postoperative complications included 1 reoperation for sepsis caused by inadequately resected CMV colitis; 1 pancreatic fistula; 1 wound dehiscence, and 2 minor wound infections.\r"

The data indicates that the probability of reoperation for structural valve failure is quite reasonable as of 10 years, but from 10 to 15 years the numbers sharply fall off so that the probable effective life of the valve is 10 years. However in the elderly age group (equal to or greater than 70 years of age) the incidence of structural valve degeneration is markedly diminished, making this an ideal valve substitute for the elderly. It is also an ideal valve substitute in any patient who has a contraindication to long-term anticoagulation because of current medical or surgical problems.\r"

  ".W": "Delayed gastric emptying in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease may be due to an incompetent distal esophageal sphincter and/or a gastric abnormality. To determine the influence of the Nissen fundoplication on gastric emptying we studied the rate of gastric emptying before and after operation in 25 patients with proved gastroesophageal reflux disease. Nine patients had no gastric pathology, 9 had gastric acid hypersecretion, 5 had gastritis, and 2 had evidence of significant duodenogastric reflux. All were treated by Nissen fundoplication. Those with gastric acid hypersecretion also had a proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV) and the two patients with pathologic duodenogastric reflux were treated by a bile diversion procedure. We found that in gastroesophageal reflux disease with associated gastric pathology there was a higher prevalence of delayed gastric emptying before operation than in patients without gastric pathology. Nissen fundoplication was associated with speeding of gastric emptying in patients with or without gastric pathology. Proximal gastric vagotomy performed in association with Nissen fundoplication augmented the speeding of gastric emptying, which was advantagenous in most cases but detrimental in two. Every patient in whom gastric emptying was not normalized had postoperative symptoms. Only two of 20 patients with normal postoperative gastric emptying had postoperative symptoms. Both patients had preexisting gastric pathology. Based on these findings, the side effects associated with Nissen fundoplication are due to the failure to normalize gastric emptying rather than the operation.\r"

Because secondary infection of pancreatic necrosis accounts for more than 80% of all deaths from acute pancreatitis, a method for determining the presence or absence of parenchymal necrosis would offer considerable prognostic and therapeutic information. Thirty seven patients with unequivocal acute pancreatitis and five normal controls were prospectively studied with intravenous bolus, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (dynamic pancreatography). In the absence of pancreatic necrosis, there were no significant differences in parenchymal enhancement between any of the following patient groups: controls (5), uncomplicated pancreatitis (20), pancreatic abscess (7), or peripancreatic necrosis (4)(p less than 0.05). On the other hand, pancreatic parenchymal enhancement was significantly reduced or absent in all six patients with segmental or diffuse pancreatic necrosis (p less than 0.05). Postcontrast pancreatic parenchymal enhancement was also found to be inversely correlated with the number of Ranson signs (p less than 0.001). Dynamic pancreatography offers prognostic information and is a safe and reliable technique for predicting the presence or absence of pancreatic parenchymal necrosis.\r"

Attempting to improve current methods for detecting colorectal liver metastases, CEA levels in gallbladder bile and serum from patients with known liver metastases were determined. One hundred per cent of patients with single and multiple metastases of various dimensions were observed to have gallbladder bile CEA levels strikingly higher than serum values (4.7 to 259 times greater, p = 0.0009). Linear regression analysis of estimated tumor volume and surface area versus gallbladder bile CEA levels predicted that very small tumors (less than or equal to 1 cm3 in volume) might produce detectable levels (9 to 41 ng/mL) of biliary CEA. For this reason, patients who lack clinical and radiologic evidence of distant metastases at the time of primary colorectal resection but who do have elevated gallbladder bile CEA levels (greater than or equal to 10 ng/mL) are being followed for the appearance of occult hepatic metastases.\r"

The subjects received parenteral nutrition containing 20 calories/kg per day and 1 g protein/kg per day. Daily injections of drug or placebo were given during the first postoperative week. The nine control subjects lost 3.3 kg (5.9% of preoperative weight) and had a cumulative nitrogen loss of 32.6 +/- 4.2 g nitrogen at eight days. The patients receiving GH lost significantly less weight (1.3 kg) and nitrogen loss was 7.1 +/- 3.1 g at eight days (p less than 0.001). Kinetic studies demonstrated that the anabolic effects of GH were associated with increased protein synthesis, and amino acid flux studies across the forearm revealed increased uptake of amino acid nitrogen in the GH-treated patients. Body compositional analysis revealed that the patients receiving GH maintained their lean body mass despite the major surgical procedure. Analysis of hand grip force showed a 10% loss of strength in the control subjects; with GH the patients maintained their grip force throughout the postoperative period. We conclude that the postoperative catabolic response can be modified with GH and hypocaloric nutrition. These metabolic and physiologic effects should now be studied in a larger number of patients to determine if this approach can reduce morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay for surgical patients.\r"

Eighty-two patients underwent resection of the celiac lymph nodes, lesser curve and cardia of the stomach, and thoracic esophagus through abdominal and neck incisions avoiding thoracotomy. The esophagus was replaced by a stomach tube in 80 patients or by a colon tube in two patients. Two of 82 patients died while hospitalized. Early postoperative morbidity included anastomotic leaks that closed spontaneously (13), transient hoarseness (10), myocardial infarction (2), pulmonary embolus (6), and atelectasis or pneumonia (13). Late postoperative complications included delayed gastric emptying (4), symptomatic reflux (4), diarrhea (10), and anastomotic strictures (17). The 2-year survival of 30% was significantly affected by the stage of disease (p = 0.003), depth of tumor penetration (p = 0.02), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001), tumor differentiation (p = 0.008), and tumor DNA ploidy (p = 0.02). Local recurrences appeared initially in 20 patients: anastomotic (3), peritoneal (14), mediastinal (3); distant metastasis occurred in 27 patients: bone (15), liver (5), brain (2), and multiple organs (5). Swallowing was restored and maintained in 75 patients. Esophagogastrectomy without thoracotomy provides a safe, effective method of restoring swallowing in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction. This technique provides acceptable survival and local recurrence rates.\r"

Less common causes of CCS include blunt trauma, venous insufficiency, and tumor. CCS is clinically manifested as claudication, tightness, and occasional paresthesia. Unlike other forms of overuse injury (tendonitis, stress fracture), CCS does not respond to rest, anti-inflammatory medications, or physical therapy. The diagnosis of this condition is confirmed by elevated compartment pressures (normal less than 15 mmHg; CCS greater than 20 mmHg). The only effective treatment is surgical compartment release. Two hundred nine patients have been surgically treated for CCS, 100 by subcutaneous fasciotomy (group I) and 109 by open fasciectomy (group II). These procedures were usually performed in ambulatory surgery using local anesthesia. Patients treated by open faciectomy instead of subcutaneous fasciotomy had fewer early postoperative wound complications (6% vs. 11%) and fewer late recurrences (2% vs. 11%).\r"

It should not interfere with future definitive therapy. In patients with terminal malignancy, it should be economical in cost and should minimize hospitalization. We used biopsy forceps and the rigid bronchoscope to \"core out\" 56 patients with obstructing airway neoplasms. The location of the obstruction was trachea in 16 patients, carina in 24, main bronchi in 8, and distal airway in 8. Improvement in the airway was accomplished in 90% of patients. A single bronchoscopy was sufficient in 96%. Nineteen complications occurred in 11 patients: pneumonia in 5, bleeding in 3, pneumothorax in 2, hypoxia/hypercarbia in 2, arrhythmias in 6, and laryngeal edema in 1. There were four deaths within 2 weeks of core-out related to respiratory failure. Further therapy consisted of resection in 28.6% (tracheal in 9, carinal in 3, pulmonary in 4), irradiation alone or in combination with chemotherapy in 60.7%, and no therapy in 10.7%. Palliation of symptoms and establishment of an airway in acute obstruction is the goal. Survival depends on the effectiveness of the proposed treatment. We find this time-honored method superior to use of the laser.\r"

The present two-part study was undertaken to (1) determine if on-line computerized electroencephalographic changes correlated with neurological outcome and (2) compare neurological outcome with that of a second group of patients who received intraoperative interventions based on electroencephalographic data. Part 1 consisted of monitoring 50 patients. A power drop index was developed that correlated with new global neurological deficits. New global deficits occurred in 44% of the patients. In part 2, this information was used to design intervention criteria. Treatment protocols used previously accepted methods of increasing cerebral blood flow, ie, increasing pump flow, raising mean arterial pressure, and increasing CO2 content in the ventilator blend. Global neurological deficits were reduced to 5% in a group of 41 clinically similar patients (p less than 0.001). Cerebral perfusion pressures were similar in both groups. The single correlating factor was the power drop index as identified by computerized EEG. Our conclusion is that simple intervention guided by computerized EEG can reduce global neurological deficits in patients having cardiopulmonary bypass procedures.\r"

In surgical studies, such crossover usually occurs when control patients become more symptomatic and undergo operation. In several large studies of coronary bypass grafting, crossover ranged from 25% to 38%. The most common way of dealing with this problem is to apply the \"intention-to-treat\" principle, which analyzes such crossovers with their originally assigned groups. Besides the logical problem of counting a control patient who actually undergoes operation as \"nonsurgical,\" a more subtle problem arises in terms of statistical power. When statistical power is low, a truly effective treatment may be mistakenly labeled as no better than control, causing a potentially valuable form of therapy to be ignored or discarded. This analysis demonstrates that crossover may have a profound effect on the statistical power of randomized studies and presents a method for predicting the effect of such crossover on statistical power.\r"

Isolated coarctation was present in 25 patients (group 1); in 19 patients coarctation existed in association with ventricular septal defect (group 2); and in 26 patients coarctation was associated with major intracardiac defects (group 3). Subclavian flap angioplasty was performed in 19 patients and resection and end-to-end anastomosis in 51 patients. Hospital mortality was not significantly different between subclavian flap angioplasty (11%) and resection and end-to-end anastomosis (24%). Freedom from reintervention for recoarctation after 5 years was 87% in the subclavian flap angioplasty group and 95% in the group having resection and end-to-end anastomosis. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 100% for group 1, 73% for group 2, and 28% for group 3. In the subclavian flap angioplasty group, we observed detrimental effects of the sacrifice of the left subclavian artery: 1 patient had a 2.5-cm shortening of the left upper arm, and 5 others complained of claudication in the left upper limb during strenuous exercise. As no major advantage in terms of mortality and recoarctation to either technique of coarctation repair was found, and as subclavian flap angioplasty carries the possible disadvantage of late contracture of isthmic ductal tissue and possible detrimental effects on the left upper limb, resection and end-to-end anastomosis is recommended.\r"

To evaluate the etiology of this metabolic defect, we measured the levels of adenine nucleotides and their precursors in 29 patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization. Myocardial biopsy specimens were obtained at 37 degrees C before cardioplegic arrest, immediately after 74 +/- 4 minutes of cardioplegic arrest, and after 30 minutes of reperfusion. Biopsy specimens were analyzed for levels of adenine nucleotides and their precursors by high-performance liquid chromatography. Adenosine triphosphate concentrations decreased with cardioplegic arrest and with reperfusion. Adenosine monophosphate concentrations increased after cardioplegic arrest and remained nearly twice the initial values after reperfusion. The ratio of adenosine monophosphate to adenosine triphosphate doubled after reperfusion, suggesting defective conversion of adenosine monophosphate to adenosine triphosphate. Levels of adenine nucleotide degradation products (adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine) increased after cardioplegia and decreased with reperfusion, suggesting a washout of soluble precursors. This study suggests that improvements in myocardial protection should attempt to stimulate mitochondrial energy production and preserve adenine nucleotide precursors.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed the results of two different forms of surgical management of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy refractory to medical therapy. Twenty-one patients were treated with 22 procedures between 1963 and 1987. Eleven underwent a ventricular septal procedure by myotomy with or without myectomy, and 11 underwent mitral valve replacement (MVR), 1 of whom had previously undergone a ventricular septal procedure. The groups were comparable with respect to severity and duration of symptoms, age range, electrocardiographic features, and hemodynamic changes. Mitral valve replacement produced a greater and more consistent reduction in the left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient than a ventricular septal procedure (MVR, 68.3 mm Hg preoperatively and 2.5 mm Hg postoperatively; ventricular septal procedure, 60.1 mm Hg preoperatively and 13.4 mm Hg postoperatively). This was associated with better postoperative ventricular configuration in diastole and more apparent loss of midcavity narrowing in systole. Ejection fraction did not fall after a ventricular septal procedure but decreased significantly from a mean of 79% to a mean of 61% after MVR. Similarly, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure remained unchanged after a ventricular septal procedure but fell from a mean of 26.6 mm Hg to 17 mm Hg after MVR. Although both groups experienced a generally satisfactory symptomatic result, this appeared more reliable with MVR. We suggest that MVR offers a more predictable improvement than a ventricular septal procedure and may be the procedure of choice for units with limited experience with ventricular septal procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Two groups of patients were prospectively studied to evaluate the hemostatic effects of high-dose aprotinin in open heart operations. Group A patients (n = 22) received aprotinin during the entire surgical procedure. Group B patients (n = 12) served as controls. The groups were homogeneous for base variables and for cardiopulmonary bypass duration. Postoperative bleeding was lower in group A (mean, 486 mL) than in group B (830 mL) (p less than 0.01). The need for banked blood decreased by approximately half in the aprotinin patients (mean: group A, 213 mL; group B, 409 mL). Hemoglobin levels were similar in the two groups (postoperative day 7: group A, 11.29 g/100 mL; group B, 11.26 g/100 mL; NS). Platelet count decreased at the end of operation in both groups (99,000 and 95,000/mL, respectively; NS) and then increased beyond baseline levels before discharge. No complications were observed that could be attributed to aprotinin. In conclusion, we believe that the use of high-dose aprotinin is safe and effective. It decreases blood loss and reduces the need for banked blood in cardiac operations, particularly in select groups of patients (eg, those undergoing reoperation, Jehovah's Witnesses, those with renal failure).\r"

  ".U": "90025512\r", 
  ".W": "Pericardial effusion frequently occurs after cardiac operation. Despite its high incidence, the etiological process of postoperative pericardial effusion remains unclear. Residual blood or thrombus has often been suggested as a possible cause, implying that the occurrence of pericardial effusion could be related to the effectiveness of postoperative thoracic drainage. This possible relationship, however, has never been studied. We found that prolonging the duration of thoracic drainage by 24 hours often increases total chest tube output considerably but does not affect the incidence of postoperative pericardial effusion: approximately 55% of 100 patients in this study were shown by two-dimensional echocardiography to have pericardial effusion on the sixth postoperative day, regardless of the duration of postoperative drainage. Because of this, and because a long period of drainage causes discomfort for the patient, mechanical irritation to the heart and the pericardium, and an increased risk of infection, we recommend removing drains as soon as their efficacy has peaked, preferably on the first postoperative day.\r"

We used intraoperative color flow mapping echocardiography to assess the results of surgical repair of atrioventricular septal defect in 19 consecutive patients and compared those findings with results three to five days and 3 to 11 months after repair. There was close correlation between intraoperative and postoperative color flow mapping echocardiography in estimating the presence and severity of left atrioventricular valve regurgitation. All patients survived surgical repair, but in 4 (21%), postoperative congestive heart failure due to left atrioventricular valve regurgitation developed. The need for reoperation was significantly correlated with the severity of left atrioventricular valve regurgitation (r = 0.68) as estimated by intraoperative echocardiography and preoperative aberrancies in the atrioventricular valve (r = 0.68). Age, weight, additional congenital heart disease, preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance, preoperative atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and postoperative mean pulmonary arterial or left atrial pressure were not significantly correlated with the need for reoperation. Intraoperative color flow mapping echocardiography can accurately predict the development of early postoperative heart failure and subsequent reoperation after surgical repair of atrioventricular septal defect.\r"

All patients underwent a median sternotomy, although this was performed after a bilateral submammary skin incision in most of the 57 female patients. There were no operative deaths, but one late death occurred at 5 months. During a mean followup of 3.6 years, 67 patients (80%) benefited from operation with remission achieved in 30 (36%) and improvement noted in 37 (44%). Acetylcholine receptor site antibody was present in 43 patients, of whom 19 (44%) achieved remission in contrast to 9 (27%) of the 33 patients without antibody. Hyperplasia of the excised thymus in 38 patients was associated with remission in 20 (53%) in contrast to remission in 7 (20%) of the 35 patients whose glands were \"normal\" or atrophic. The best prognosis was found in the 23 patients who had both receptor site antibody and thymic hyperplasia, as remission occurred in 15 of them (65%) in contrast to only 6 (27%) of the 22 patients who had neither factor. Remission rates (remissions per 1,000 patient-months of follow-up) for the present series (84 patients), the previous group (249 patients), and the overall group (333 patients) are 9.95, 6.13, and 6.62, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve patients with anomalous left coronary artery (LCA) from the pulmonary artery were treated surgically. Mean age was 13 months and mean weight, 7.7 kg. One of the following techniques was used in 8 patients: suture obliteration of the coronary orifice, ligation of the anomalous LCA and grafting of the internal mammary artery to the distal LCA, aortic reimplantation of the anomalous LCA, creation of an aortopulmonary window, and direct anastomosis to the right subclavian artery. In 4 patients, a new technique to establish a two-coronary artery system involved tube extension of the anomalous LCA with pulmonary artery wall and then anastomosis to the right subclavian artery using cardiopulmonary by-pass without aortic cross-clamping. There were two hospital deaths (17%) and one late death. The condition of the 9 long-term survivors was improved at late follow-up. Postoperative assessment showed smaller Q wave on the electrocardiogram, reduced cardiac size, and good left ventricular function. All patients in whom the repair was done using the new technique were free from postoperative cardiac complications, had shortened hospital stays, and were alive with a patent two-coronary artery system at late follow-up. We believe this approach is a safer method for establishing a two-coronary artery system in infants and small children with an anomalous LCA arising from the pulmonary artery.\r"

The mediastinum was declared negative only when intraoperative mediastinal lymph node dissection showed tumor-free nodes.

Twenty-two of the 75 remaining patients had a positive computed tomographic scan and underwent mediastinoscopy. Fourteen patients with positive results were considered to have inoperable disease. Fifty-three patients (70.7%) did not undergo mediastinoscopy. We performed seven probably incomplete resections, two for palliative reasons, and two thoracotomies without resection in patients with N2 disease. A policy of routine mediastinoscopy would have prevented only 5% of the thoracotomies performed in patients with lung cancer.\r"

In addition, opinions regarding causes and deterrents of malpractice litigation were obtained. Results suggested that claims or threats of malpractice suits had a negative impact on physicians' practices and emotional well-being; that this negative impact was more pronounced when the sued physician had been more personally involved with his patient prior to the malpractice claim; and that suing patients' and sued physicians' understanding of their relationship before the malpractice claim significantly differed. All respondents viewed improved physician-patient communication as the most effective method of preventing malpractice claims. Informal, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in hospitals and clinics and improved peer review may decrease litigation and its deleterious effects.\r"

Weight-bearing activity has been commonly considered to be essential for the beneficial effects of exercise on the skeleton, and, therefore, swimming has been considered valueless in the maintenance of bone mass. To examine this issue we measured radial and vertebral bone mineral density in a group of subjects aged 40 to 85 years who had been swimming regularly for at least 3 years as well as in a similar group of nonexercising control subjects. The swimmers engaged in no other forms of regular exercise, and no subject had other conditions known to affect bone or mineral metabolism. Dietary calcium and protein intakes were similar in the two groups. At both radial (0.84 +/- 0.08 vs 0.81 +/- 0.09 g/cm2) and vertebral (123 +/- 27 vs 108 +/- 31 mg/cm3) sites the male swimmers had significantly greater bone mineral density than did the nonexercisers. In women, however, no relationship of swimming to bone mineral density could be identified. These results suggest that swimming exercise may be beneficial in the prevention or therapy of osteopenia and that its usefulness in this regard should be further investigated.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the clinical features of disease due to tuberculosis and to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in 94 patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Tuberculosis preceded the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in 26 (67%) of 39 cases, compared with none of 55 with MAC infection. Chest roentgenographic findings suggested mycobacterial infection in 24 (83%) of 29 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, compared with 7 (25%) of 28 with MAC infection. Sputum smears revealed acid-fast bacilli in 19 (83%) of 23 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, but only 4 (16%) of 25 cases of pulmonary MAC infection. In 39 patients with tuberculosis, lymphadenitis and pleuritis were present in 13 (33%) and 8 (20%), respectively, but occurrence was rare in patients with MAC infection. In contrast, mycobacteremia was more frequent in MAC infection, occurring in 47 (85%) of 55 cases. In 5 patients, tuberculosis was unsuspected and probably contributed to death. These findings suggest that clinical features often distinguish tuberculosis from MAC infection in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. In addition, more intensive diagnostic use of sputum acid-fast smears may improve the outcome in patients with tuberculosis.\r"

Chorioretinitis compatible with Candida infection was found in 9 (28%) patients. Patient age, sex, underlying diseases, or hospital-acquired factors, such as presence of central venous or Foley catheters, bacteremia, use of multiple antibiotics, hyperalimentation, or surgery, did not distinguish between groups. Groups were also similar in number of sites colonized with yeast and species of Candida recovered. Patients with endophthalmitis tended to have more blood cultures positive for Candida (mean, 4.3) than the patients without endophthalmitis (mean, 2.8), but this trend did not reach statistical significance. Based on these results, we recommend periodic ophthalmoscopic examinations in all patients with documented candidemia.\r"

In order to address these issues, we performed a retrospective cohort study of 100 pregnancies in 77 women treated with heparin during pregnancy. In 98 pregnancies heparin therapy was given for the prevention or treatment of venous thromboembolism; in the remaining 2, because of prosthetic heart valves. The rates of prematurity, abortions, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and congenital abnormalities were similar to those in the normal population. There were two bleeding episodes and no symptomatic thrombotic episodes associated with heparin therapy. We conclude that maternal heparin therapy is safe for the fetus and is associated with an acceptable bleeding rate and a low rate of thrombotic recurrence in the mother.\r"

Although the mean number of physical therapy sessions declined from 11.1 to 9.8 (11.7%), the average number of treatments per day during the physical therapy phase actually increased from 1.2 before to 1.4 after the prospective payment system. The proportion of patients discharged to nursing homes remained the same (52.9% vs 53.6%); the proportion of patients remaining in a nursing home 6 months after hospital discharge did not differ significantly (22.6% vs 19.9%). Furthermore, there were no differences in the 6-month ambulation status. Total adjusted average hospital charges for the pre- and post-prospective payment system groups did not increase significantly ($7295 vs $7565). These findings do not support the contention that the quality of care provided Medicare patients with hip fractures has deteriorated in this hospital environment.\r"

The elevation rarely exceeded three times the upper limit of normal. One patient had severe jaundice. An abnormality of at least one of these values was found in 55 patients (65%). There were no differences in site of infection, bacteria isolated, and outcome between patients with and without biochemical abnormalities.

Retrospective analysis after clinical and pathologic follow-up indicated that the sensitivity of TPBS alone in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis was 100%, with a specificity of only 38% and an accuracy of 63%; the sensitivity of WBCS alone was 100%, with a specificity of 78% and an accuracy of 87%; and the combination of TPBS and WBCS yielded a sensitivity of 100%, with a specificity of 79% and an accuracy of 87%. Roentgenography yielded a sensitivity of 69%, with a specificity of 82% and an accuracy of 76%. The results of this study demonstrate that WBCS is superior to TPBS in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot, and TPBS adds little when viewed in conjunction with WBCS. Based on our observations and because of the high prevalence of neuropathic joint disease and other causes of false-positive bone scans, we believe that WBCS alone is adequate for evaluation of suspected pedal osteomyelitis in diabetic patients, particularly when the suspected lesion is located in the tarsometatarsal region in contrast to the toe region (7% vs 44% specificity and 28% vs 69% accuracy, respectively, for TPBS in these two regions, compared with 100% vs 68% specificity and 100% vs 80% accuracy, respectively, for WBCS in the same two regions).\r"

We achieved 100% success in determining the causes of dyspnea compared with only 66% accuracy based on clinical impression alone. Four groups of disorders, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung diseases, and cardiomyopathy accounted for two thirds of the cases. Findings on the history and physical examination were too nonspecific to determine the specific diagnosis. Pulmonary function testing, including a methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge, were the most useful diagnostic tests, particularly for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Chest roentgenogram was most useful for interstitial lung disease, and comprehensive exercise testing for dyspnea due to psychogenic factors or deconditioning. Specific therapy was effective in reducing or eliminating dyspnea in the majority of cases. We conclude that a diagnostic approach to chronic dyspnea based on objective findings and verification, rather than clinical impression alone, will consistently lead to an accurate diagnosis and an improved therapeutic outcome.\r"

By developing regression models, the unique contribution of different variables to prediction of current examination scores was determined. Prior American Board of Internal Medicine certification examination performance accounted for 70.9% of the explained variance, and demographic and practice variables were responsible for 17.8%. Among the demographic and practice variables studied, community size and subspecialty practice were the only variables that contributed significantly to the regression equations. Examination scores were highest for certified internists practicing in smaller communities. General internists received higher scores than subspecialists. Although statistically significant, the apparent adverse influence of subspecialty practice and larger community size on examination performance was modest. Further study is needed to determine if longer periods in practice might produce different relationships between variables such as these and examination performance.\r"

However, 5 of 28 women exercising 300 min/wk or more had surprisingly low bone density, not explained by other factors. In 50 men, we also found a strong positive correlation between exercise and bone density for those up to age 65 years. Over age 65, 3 men had low bone density despite extremely vigorous exercise. We conclude that moderate weight-bearing exercise may increase lumbar bone density, but we raise the hypothesis that extremely vigorous exercise actually may be detrimental to bone density in individuals after age 50.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the early clinical performance of an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator with a nonepicardial lead system in patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Ten patients, mean age 67 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 35%, refractory to 5 +/- 2 antiarrhythmic drugs and with a history of prior cardiac surgery (7 patients), severe lung disease (2 patients), or renal failure (1 patient) underwent device and lead system implant. A tripolar electrode catheter with one sensing electrode and two defibrillating electrodes was placed in the right ventricular apex and a left thoracic submuscular patch electrode was used in an epicostal location. Defibrillation energy threshold was determined using dual- or triple-electrode configurations. Optimal patch electrode location was determined after temporary use of a cutaneous patch electrode prior to cardioverter/defibrillator implant. Electrophysiologic studies were performed before discharge and after 2 to 3 months to assess device function. Percutaneous insertion and placement of the electrode catheter was achieved in all patients. Defibrillation energy threshold testing was done using 1 to 4 (mean, 2.7) electrode configurations per patient and required 6 to 21 (mean, 13) ventricular fibrillation inductions and 8 to 56 (mean, 22) shocks per patient. In all patients, lowest reliable defibrillation energy threshold was obtained with a triple-electrode configuration (right ventricular common cathode with right atrial and thoracic patch as dual anodes) and bidirectional shocks (mean, 18 +/- 5 J). Optimal patch electrode position could be determined in 9 of 10 patients, and these 9 patients had cardioverter/defibrillator implant. Ventricular fibrillation termination with the first delivered shock at electrophysiologic study was documented in all patients. There was no perioperative mortality in device-implanted patients. Postoperative electrophysiologic studies before discharge (9 patients) and at 3 months (8 patients) continued to demonstrate successful defibrillation by the first device shock. During follow-up (range, 2 to 10 months; mean, 6 +/- 3 months), spontaneous device discharges occurred in 4 patients with inappropriate shocks due to electrode catheter fracture being documented in 1 patient. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy was withdrawn in 6 patients and reduced in 3 patients. We conclude, based on our preliminary experience, that an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator can be successfully used with a nonepicardial lead system for endocardial defibrillation in many patients. This lead system can be used with currently available pulse generators and should be considered at cardioverter/defibrillator implantation. It can be anticipated to reduce patient risk and hospital costs associated with this procedure.\r"

Three of these, namely, length of medical benefit, quality of medical benefit, and likelihood of medical benefit, entail comparisons of patients. The fourth, medical benefit, involves identifying for each patient whether or not a significant benefit is likely to result from treatment. I contend that the three types of comparative justification are questionable. For example, they rest on statistical generalities that are misleading in particular situations, and they value characteristics of persons (such as life-years) more than they respect persons themselves. I also contend that the fourth type of medical justification, rooted as it is in response to human need, is ethically sound, but that it warrants a medical-benefit criterion rather than an age criterion.\r"

We studied 28 risk factors through a matched case-control study that included 88 pairs of patients hospitalized between July 1983 and December 1986. The strongest single risk factor found in the univariate analysis was the number of prior antibiotics administered: the exposure odds ratio (OR) was 12.50 when patients who received three to five antibiotics were compared with those who received none to two antibiotics. A multiple logistic regression analysis using a conditional likelihood method was performed to evaluate several risk factors simultaneously. The final model selected by a stepwise procedure included the following variables: number of antibiotics received prior to infection (OR, 1.73 per unit increase), isolation of Candida species from sites other than blood (OR, 10.37), prior hemodialysis (OR, 18.13), and prior use of a Hickman catheter (OR, 7.23). It remains to be shown in controlled clinical trials whether limiting the number of antibiotics or instituting prophylaxis and/or early treatment for high-risk patients will reduce the incidence of nosocomial candidemia.\r"

To define the prevalence and mechanism of hypophosphatemia under these circumstances, we studied phosphate homeostasis in 22 patients with chronic asthma, who had been hospitalized for emergency bronchodilator therapy. Serum phosphate concentration was normal in all patients on presentation, and fell after the initiation of bronchodilator therapy. Twelve patients (54%) developed hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate, less than 0.8 mmol/L). Urinary phosphate level fell in parallel. A negative correlation was observed between serum phosphate and serum theophylline concentrations, and a positive correlation between serum and urinary phosphate concentrations. No correlation was found between serum phosphate and serum albumin or urea concentration. These data indicate that hypophosphatemia is a common metabolic abnormality during the emergency treatment of asthma. The underlying mechanism appears to be drug-induced phosphate flux from the extra-cellular to the intracellular space. We suggest that the serum phosphate level be monitored in patients undergoing emergency treatment of bronchospasm, particularly if a prolonged period of bronchodilator therapy is required or if respiratory muscle fatigue supervenes.\r"

The presence of acute hypertension, renal insufficiency, livedo reticularis, and gangrenous skin changes are characteristic manifestations of the multiple cholesterol emboli syndrome. Additionally, gastrointestinal symptoms and melena may herald ischemia and infarction of the alimentary tract. Anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy are relatively contraindicated in this syndrome and may, in fact, be a precipitating cause. The prognosis is usually poor; however, survival is possible with aggressive medical and surgical therapy, despite extensive infarction of the gastrointestinal tract and other organs. Prevention remains the most critical aspect of management of this potentially catastrophic illness.\r"

  ".U": "90025664\r", 
  ".W": "Margit Fischer reported in 1971 that the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring of her Danish schizophrenic monozygotic twins and their normal cotwins was equal and not different from the risks in the children of schizophrenics in the literature. All of her identical and fraternal twins who had children and all of their offspring have been followed up through the Danish National Psychiatric Register as of 1985, some 18 years after study by Fischer. The morbid risk (age-corrected) for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related disorders in the offspring of schizophrenic identical twins is 16.8%; it is 17.4% in their normal cotwins' offspring. The risks in the offspring of schizophrenic fraternal twins and their normal cotwins are 17.4% and 2.1%, respectively. The results suggest that discordance in identical twins may primarily be explained by the capacity of a schizophrenic genotype or diathesis to be unexpressed unless it is released by some kinds of environmental, including nonfamilial, stressors. Sporadic cases and phenocopies caused by cerebral abnormalities, diseases, or viruses would thus be deemphasized as necessary or sufficient explanatory causes for schizophrenia in our study but could account for some of the remaining discordance, infrequent phenocopies should encourage linkage researchers, but unexpression of genotypes will frustrate them.\r"

Three studies, all based on the admission statistics of Scottish psychiatric hospitals, were therefore undertaken to determine whether those who were in utero during the influenza A epidemics of 1918 to 1919 and 1957 were subsequently at increased risk of schizophrenia. Edinburgh data suggest that those who were in the sixth month of intrauterine development during the 1957 epidemic were subsequently at increased risk, but Scottish national data do not reveal any increased risk associated with either the 1918 to 1919 or 1957 epidemics. Overall, the hypothesis that maternal influenza may contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia is not supported, but the possibility cannot yet be discounted.\r"

  ".W": "Using a subsample from the Copenhagen schizophrenia high-risk project, we examined the contributions of schizophrenic genetic liability and perinatal complications to computed tomographic (CT) measurements of ventricular enlargement and cortical and cerebellar abnormalities. A factor analysis of six CT measurements yielded two significant factors. One factor reflected multisite neural deficits as evidenced by abnormality of the cerebellar vermis and widening of the sylvian and interhemispheric fissures and cortical sulci. The other factor reflected periventricular damage as evidenced by enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. Because all of the subjects had schizophrenic mothers, the major source of genetic variation is contributed by the diagnostic status of their fathers. In a stepwise multiple-regression analysis, it was determined that the multisite neural deficits factor was significantly related to genetic risk for schizophrenia (as measured by schizophrenia spectrum illness in the subjects' fathers) but was unrelated to pregnancy or delivery complications or to weight at birth. Periventricular damage was highly and significantly correlated with the number of complications suffered at delivery, but only among subjects with an elevated genetic risk. Although limited by a small sample size, these results suggest that the two types of CT abnormalities in schizophrenia may reflect partially independent processes based on different combinations of genetic and perinatal influences.\r"

Recently, increased numbers of B lymphocytes expressing the CD5 (Leu-1) surface antigen have been observed in patients with certain autoimmune diseases. In the present study, approximately 30% of schizophrenic patients (11/34) were found by cytofluorometric methods to have similarly increased levels of circulating CD5+ B cells compared with 6% (2/33) of healthy individuals and 5% (1/20) of patients with bipolar affective disorder. In schizophrenic patients with a \"high\" CD5+ B-cell phenotype, the percentage of B cells expressing the CD5 surface marker (mean +/- SEM, 52.4% +/- 3.5%) was comparable to that reported for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and significantly greater than that reported for patients with bipolar affective disorder (25.7% +/- 2.5%) and healthy controls (31.0% +/- 1.8%). Schizophrenic patients with high levels of CD5+ B cells had increased numbers of total B cells compared with control subjects and patients with low levels of CD5+ B cells. An elevation in CD5+ B cells may delineate a subgroup of schizophrenic patients whose disease has an underlying autoimmune and/or genetic cause.\r"

The relatives of schizotypy-positive probands were significantly more likely to have been treated for schizophrenia than the relatives of schizotypy-negative probands. Morbid risk for unipolar depression or bipolar disorder among first-degree relatives did not differ between the proband groups.

The three leading antipsychotic drugs-thioridazine, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine-constituted 66% to 69% of antipsychotic prescriptions and, along with trifluoperazine, thiothixene, and fluphenazine, accounted for 90% to 91% of all antipsychotic prescriptions throughout the period studied. Thioridazine was the leading medication, with a consistent third of the market share, while the market share for chlorpromazine decreased from 1976 to 1985 and that for haloperidol increased for the same years. Data also indicate that haloperidol is the antipsychotic drug used most frequently in office-based, private medical practice for patients 60 years of age and older, a declining proportion of women are treated with antipsychotic medications, and use of antipsychotic drugs as monotherapy for the primary diagnosis is increasing. We also obtained data on diagnoses associated with antipsychotic drug use.\r"

All in situ tumors and 6 of the invasive tumors were associated with histologic changes typical of condyloma, despite the absence of clinical anogenital warts. Immunohistochemical studies for viral capsid antigen gave positive reactions in two anal warts and in the condylomatous area associated with one invasive tumor. In situ hybridization was accomplished using isotopic DNA probes for HPV 6/11, 16, 18, and 31. Human papillomavirus 6/11 was expressed in the corresponding capsid-positive regions in the two warts and the wart-associated invasive carcinoma. Both HPV 6/11 and HPV 16 were associated with one carcinoma in situ, and HPV 16 was also found within two invasive anal carcinomas, one of which was associated with an extensive vulvar cancer. While these observations do not resolve the \"passenger\" or direct oncogenic role for HPV in anal carcinoma, the circumstantial evidence is that the oncogenic influence is similar to that accepted for female genital tract cancer.\r"

Recent availability of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against various CK polypeptides has made it possible to study their development during cellular differentiation. We analyzed the expression of CKs in the human liver during development. Twenty-four liver specimens were tested by the avidin-biotin complex immunohistochemical method by using three MoAbs against different CK polypeptides (CAM 5.2 against CKs 50, 43, and 39 kd; AE1 against acidic CKs 56.5, 50/50', 48, and 40 kd; and 34 beta E12 against CKs 58, 56.5, and 56 kd). Liver parenchymal cells in fetuses as early as 4 weeks of gestational age reacted with MoAbs CAM 5.2 and AE1, but the expression of AE1-positive CK polypeptides in hepatocytes disappeared by 24 weeks of gestational age. Small cells, presumably ductal plate cells, in direct contact with mesenchyme around the portal vein and along the branches of portal veins, showed strong staining with MoAbs CAM 5.2, AE1, and 34 beta E12, identical to that of bile ducts. In neonates, children, and even in adults, residual MoAbs CAM 5.2-,Ae1, and 34 beta E 12-positive cells were present around the branches of portal veins. These findings suggested that the CK profile of liver parenchymal cells changes during their differentiation into hepatocytes, whereas that of ductal plate cells and bile ducts remains unaltered with respect to the polypeptides tested here. Some ductal plate cells may persist in neonates, children, and even in adults.\r"

The embolic source was cardiac in two cases and carotid artery in one. The findings in these cases support the hypothesis that small thromboemboli may not be randomly distributed in the cerebral arterial supply but may be preferentially distributed to the small terminal arterial branches in the borderzones between major arterial territories. Previous reports of this phenomenon laid emphasis on the sharp angle at which small penetrating arteries branched from parent arteries as the mechanism underlying this preferential distribution. We propose that the unequal size of the branches at the majority of bifurcations of subarachnoid arteries is a more important anatomic feature leading to this pattern of infarction.\r"

The differential diagnosis of carcinosarcoma should be considered for any lesion believed to represent a primary sarcoma of the lung, and in some cases carcinomatous elements may only be demonstrable by immunohistologic means.\r"

  ".W": "The cytoplasmic filament composition of two pure high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas and five pure endometrial rhabdomyosarcomas was studied using the immunoperoxidase avidin-biotin method. Ultrastructural correlates were performed on the same tissues. While four of the seven tumors presented as high-grade undifferentiated neoplasms, they were readily categorized on the basis of immunocytochemical findings in which the five rhabdomyosarcomas were positive for muscle-specific actin (HHF 35) and the two stromal sarcomas were positive for vimentin only. Ultrastructure on the HHF 35-positive cases showed the presence of thick filaments and Z-band material, whereas the other tumors showed no cytoplasmic differentiation. Muscle-type actin differs stromal cells, and is useful when used in conjunction with a panel of antibodies in the categorization of undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas.\r"

  ".W": "Two monoclonal antibodies (29.1 and 528), which were raised against the epidermal growth factor receptor, were used to evaluate expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in frozen uterine tissue with immunohistochemical techniques. Monoclonal antibody 29.1 stained only vascular endothelium and glandular epithelium in patients who were blood type A. This staining pattern is consistent with the previously reported blood type A specificity of this antibody. Monoclonal antibody 528, which recognizes a peptide determinant is thought to be specific for the epidermal growth factor receptor, stained both endometrial glands and endometrial stromal cells heavily. Faint staining was also seen in myometrium in most cases. This marked difference in expression of epidermal growth factor receptor between endometrium and myometrium contrasts with results of prior biochemical studies in which tissue homogenates were used. No variation in intensity of staining was seen between proliferative and secretory endometrium with the use of either antibody.\r"

  ".W": "Four cases of esophageal polypoid tumors composed of squamous cell carcinoma and spindle cell sarcomatous components were investigated. Squamous cell carcinoma was consistently present in the base of the polypoid lesions in all four cases and was also intermingled with spindle-shaped sarcomatous cells in two cases. Metastases in the lymph nodes were observed in two cases: one was squamous cell carcinoma with a sarcomatous component and the other consisted of a pure sarcomatous component. All tumors involved at least the muscularis mucosae. In the sarcomatous region, the tumor was composed of highly anaplastic cells with or without forming interlacing fascicles. Pleomorphism was marked and bizarre giant cell forms were frequent. Mitoses were frequently present. Immunohistochemical study revealed that the anaplastic cells in the sarcomatous component in all cases were immunoreactive to desmin, muscle actin, vimentin, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, but were negative for cytokeratin, even in the metastatic tumors of the lymph nodes. The immunohistochemical results favor myogenic differentiation of the anaplastic cells, and these tumors were considered to be true carcinosarcomas composed of squamous cell carcinoma and leiomyosarcoma.\r"

He was found to have a single large laryngeal papilloma, widespread bronchial papillomatosis, and large cavitary lesions of the left lower lobe. A lobectomy was performed. The smooth-walled, squamous-lined cavities contained large numbers of papillomas, which were strongly positive for human papillomavirus type 11 by in situ DNA hybridization. Findings of evaluation of the patient's humoral and cell-mediated immunity were within normal limits. Cavitation appears to have resulted from bronchial obstruction, postobstructive pneumonia, and liquefactive necrosis. We speculate that squamous metaplasia allowed the continued proliferation of papillomavirus within the cavities.\r"
