  ".W": "Of 20 patients suffering trauma, with Injury Severity Scores greater than 20, 11 patients received DL-3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) at a rate of 25 mumol/kg/min for 3 hours. The remaining nine patients received sodium DL-lactate at the same rate as the control subjects. With increased arterial concentrations of ketone bodies, the femoral arteriovenous difference (arterial concentration minus venous concentration) of ketone bodies increased proportionally in the 3-OHB group (R = 0.853, p less than 0.001). Venous concentrations of nonesterified free fatty acids, alanine, glycine, and valine were decreased significantly in the 3-OHB group as compared to the control group. The concentration difference between femoral vein and artery (venous concentration minus arterial concentration) for these substrates also decreased, indicating decreased release from the extremity. A decrease in venous concentration of alanine and difference between femoral vein and artery reached 102.3 +/- 69.3 mumol/L and 32.6 +/- 22.8 mumol/L (mean +/- SD), respectively, after 3-OHB infusion. Decreased alanine release from muscle during 3-OHB infusion in traumatized patients suggests a suppressive effect of ketone body on posttraumatic protein catabolism.\r"

  ".W": "To estimate the contribution of muscle protein in whole-body protein catabolism, the muscular contribution index (MCI; urine 3-methylhistidine/urine total nitrogen) was determined in 49 cases of elective laparotomy, together with the arterial blood ketone body ratio (KBR; acetoacetate/beta-hydroxybutyrate), which reflects hepatic mitochondrial redox potential. MCI increased after operation and the occurrence of severe infection, provided KBR was maintained above 0.7. In patients with sepsis, however, MCI decreased dependently with KBR (n = 33; p less than 0.01). In these patients, plasma proteolysis-inducing activity determined by in vitro bioassay increased in inverse proportion to KBR (n = 20, p less than 0.01). Moreover, plasma concentrations of not only aromatic but also branched-chain amino acids markedly increased when KBR decreased to below 0.4 (n = 23; p less than 0.05). Thus the role of muscle protein in septic catabolism is diminished under reduced hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, despite the rapid increase of proteolysis-inducing activity. This finally leads to the failure of amino acid uptake by muscles, as well as liver. These results suggest that the deteriorated substrate exchange may form the metabolic background for multiple systems organ failure, which is often preceded by reduced KBR.\r"

In addition, development of skin replacements may benefit patients who require reconstruction or replacement of large areas of abnormal skin. We have developed a composite skin replacement composed of cultured human keratinocytes (HK) and fibroblasts. Cultured human fibroblasts are seeded into the interstices, and cultured HKs are applied to the surface of a matrix composed of type I collagen crosslinked with a glycosaminoglycan, which has a defined physical structure. After HKs reach confluence on the matrix surface, the composite grafts are placed on full-thickness wounds on the dorsum of athymic mice. Graft acceptance, confirmed by positive staining with antibodies specific for human HLA-ABC antigens on HKs, is approximately 90%. A defined skin structure is present histologically by day 10 after grafting, with a differentiated epithelium and a subepidermal layer densely populated by fibroblasts and capillaries without evidence of inflammation. Fluorescent light microscopy to identify laminin and type IV collagen and electron microscopy confirm the presence of basement membrane components by 10 days after grafting. Attachment of the graft to the wound is similar with and without the addition of human basic fibroblast growth factor, a potent angiogenic agent, to the skin replacement before graft placement on wounds.\r"

After systemic chemotherapy, a 5-year-old child underwent exploratory laparotomy at another hospital, but resection was not attempted because the tumor in the caudate lobe had extensively invaded the retrohepatic IVC. However, because not only the lack of distant metastases but also the establishment of extrahepatic collaterals were confirmed by imaging, we thought it was possible to radically resect the tumor. We successfully performed an extended left hepatic lobectomy including total excision of the caudate lobe and the involved portion of the IVC. Although we did not reconstruct the IVC, no clinical manifestations arising from caval congestion were seen. The serum alpha-fetoprotein value declined below the normal limit. Our experience with this case has introduced a radical resectability for hepatic malignancy in the caudate lobe, even if it has extended into the IVC.\r"

We describe an alternative technique for performing systematic subsegmentectomy in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, in whom hepatic arterial and portal venous embolizations were already performed as a preoperative adjuvant. Under ultrasonic guidance, each of the neighboring portal units is sequentially stained, thus defining the avascular subsegment to be resected as the nonstaining area. This allows the subsegment to be totally resected. This counterstaining identification technique can be used for all subsegments undergoing complete embolization and for other situations in which the usual staining method is impossible because of the presence of arterioportal shunting or portal tumor thrombus.\r"

FEV1 and perception of breathlessness, evaluated by Borg's 10 point category scale, were measured after each administration of doubling antigen or histamine concentrations to achieve a greater than 20% fall in FEV1, and after six minutes of steady state exercise at 80% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). The geometric mean provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) fell from 1.67 mg/ml before antigen challenge to 0.52 mg/ml 24 hours after the challenge. The median maximal % fall in FEV1 with exercise was 24.9% (range 10.5-40.5%) before and 30.6% (range 13.8-52.3%) 48 hours after antigen challenge. The median maximum % fall in FEV1 after antigen inhalation was 20.1% (range 13.3-35.2%) within the first hour; only two subjects had a late fall in FEV1 (23% and 58%). The median (range) of Borg scores obtained when FEV1 was reduced by 20% did not differ significantly for the three types of acute challenges: 1.25 (0.5-2.5) and 1.0 (0.5-3.0) after histamine tests, 1.0 (0.5-4.1) and 1.55 (0.5-2.0) after exercise, and 1.5 (0-3.0) after antigen challenge. In the two subjects who had a late response to antigen the Borg score was reduced for the same % fall in FEV1 as with the early response. It is concluded that the perception of breathlessness does not differ appreciably during the early response to histamine, antigen exposure, or exercise, but that it is reduced during the late asthmatic response. It was not influenced by previous antigen exposure, despite an increase in airway responsiveness.\r"

Pig farmers had a slightly lower FEV1 than dairy farmers (101% versus 104% predicted, NS). Symptomatic farmers had significantly lower FEV1 than symptomless farmers (93% versus 106% predicted). A multiple linear regression analysis of the cross sectional values of FEV1 showed that there was a decline in FEV1 associated with pig farming (-12 ml/year of pig farming) and smoking (-23 ml/pack year) in addition to the age related decline of 32 ml/year. A multiple linear regression analysis of PC20 histamine showed that bronchial reactivity increased with age, number of pack years, and number of years in pig farming. Work in closed pig rearing units is a pulmonary health hazard and causes decline in lung function.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies has the advantage of quantifying an objective physiological feature of asthma. Bronchial reactivity was developed in a clinical setting and has been conventionally expressed as the dose of agonist producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20). As PD20 can be estimated for less than 20% of subjects in general community surveys with the doses of agonist that are usually given, data from most subjects must be censored. Thus PD20 alone is a poor index of bronchial reactivity for epidemiological studies. Data from 809 aluminium smelter workers were used to evaluate alternative methods of analysing bronchial reactivity. Dose-response relationships were analysed by four methods: (1) PD20 by the conventional method of interpolating the dose on a logarithmic scale between the last two measurements of FEV1; (2) PD20 (with allowance for extrapolation), estimated by fitting an exponential curve to the dose-response data; (3) the linear regression slope between dose and FEV1 when significant; (4) the dose-response slope obtained in all subjects as the % change in FEV1 from baseline in response to total dose. When each of these measures was related to symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of asthma, all differentiated between \"asthmatic\" and \"non-asthmatic\" subjects. The dose-response slope (method 4) had the advantages of simplicity and no censored data, and was shown to be clinically relevant. It is suggested that the dose-response slope should be used for the analysis of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies.\r"

The aim of these studies was to determine whether the nature of the deep breath (slow or fast inspiration, five or 10 second breath hold) affects the resultant bronchodilatation. Bronchoconstriction was induced in 10 normal subjects by inhalation of histamine until specific airway conductance (sGaw) was halved (mean (SEM) post-histamine sGaw 0.099* (0.009) s-1 cm H2O-1). A subsequent deep breath to total lung capacity (TLC) increased sGaw by 57% (13%) and neither the rate of inspiration to TLC nor periods of breath holding at TLC produced a significantly different degree of bronchodilation. Reducing the volume of the deep breath produced progressively less bronchodilatation and this was no longer significant after a breath to 68% (2%) TLC. To determine whether the volume of the deep breath or the accompanying increase in transpulmonary pressure (PstL) was responsible for the effect on sGaw, subjects were studied with an oesophageal balloon in place with and without their chest strapped. Subjects took a deep breath to a PstL of 20 cm H2O after bronchoconstriction had been induced by histamine. The degree of bronchodilatation (mean (SEM) %) was not significantly different (strap on 25 (6), strap off 36 (5)) even though significantly larger lung volumes (as % TLC) were reached with the strap off (strap on 57 (2), strap off 78 (3)). These results suggest that PstL rather than lung volume during a deep breath determines airway hysteresis.\r"

Children who had required ventilation had lower values for specific airways conductance (sGaw) and a greater increase in FEV1 (delta FEV1) after salbutamol (13%) than non-ventilated children (6%); delta FEV1 was associated with the peak pressure of intermittent positive pressure ventilation, a family history of asthma and a history of wheezing, recurrent respiratory illnesses, and a doctor's diagnosis of asthma during the three years before the study. These findings indicate that after eight years of age patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have more reversible airways obstruction, compatible with increased bronchial smooth muscle tone.\r"

All patients when mildly hyperthyroid while having long term thyroxine replacement treatment and once when hypothyroid two weeks after stopping triiodothyronine for the purpose of screening for metastases. Bronchial reactivity was assessed by measuring specific airways conductance (sGaw) after increasing doses of inhaled carbachol (45-1260 micrograms). The dose producing a 35% decrease in sGaw (PD35) was determined from the cumulative log dose-response curve by linear regression analysis. Mean baseline sGaw values were similar when the patients were hypothyroid and when they were hyperthyroid (1.35 (0.36) and 1.41 (0.56) s-1 kPa-1). The interstudy coefficients of variation of baseline sGaw were higher in the thyroid patients than in a euthyroid control group (14% versus 8%). Geometric mean PD35 was lower when the patients were hypothyroid (97 micrograms) than when they were mildly hyperthyroid (192 micrograms). It is concluded that acute hypothyroidism increases non-specific bronchial reactivity in nonasthmatic subjects.\r"

By comparison with non-surgical patients these 116 patients undergoing surgery were highly selected in terms of age, favourable histological type, stage of disease, and performance score. Forty-two of the 535 non-surgical patients were given radical radiotherapy alone and seven (17%) survived five years. The remaining 493 received palliative radiotherapy, chemotherapy (alone or combined with radiotherapy), or symptomatic treatment alone; only five (1%) survived five years. Median survival was related to cell type (adenocarcinoma 2.6 months, squamous cell carcinoma 6.2 months), stage (stage I 8.5 months, stage III 4 months), and Karnofsky performance index (greater than or equal to 90 9.3 months, less than or equal to 50 1.2 months). Age and sex had no independent prognostic value in any group. Performance score was highly correlated with stage (and age) and in this study represented the \"best prognostic factor\" in clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "Cyproterone acetate is a progestational antiandrogen with potent antigonadotropic activity that results in rapid suppression of serum testosterone. Used as a single agent, cyproterone acetate yields a total androgen blockade. It may be combined with low-dose diethylstilbestrol, orchiectomy, or LHRH agonists to improve, in theory, the results of such therapy. In clinical testing, cyproterone acetate has proved equivalent to diethylstilbestrol with markedly less toxicity. It is useful in conjunction with LHRH agonists, either transiently to block the flare phenomenon, or continuously to block peripheral androgen receptors; the necessity for this latter action has not yet been proved. Cyproterone acetate may afford transient objective improvement in patients not responding to other forms of hormone deprivation. Experience in this role is limited. The drug may be used to suppress the hot flushes associated with orchiectomy or LHRH agonist therapy. Cyproterone acetate induces local tumor regression; owing to its reversible effects, it is useful as neoadjuvant or adjuvant androgen withdrawal therapy in patients with lower-stage disease undergoing radical surgery or radiotherapy. Adverse effects are mostly those related to hormone withdrawal, namely, impotence, infertility, and lassitude. Gynecomastia and breast tenderness occur in less than 18% and cardiovascular complications in approximately 10% of treated men.\r"

The rapidity, frequency, and duration of pain relief, as well as the convenience to the patient of a solitary treatment to multiple symptomatic areas simultaneously, make this type of treatment especially appealing. By following premedication and radiation dose guidelines, both acute and delayed side effects can be kept tolerable or at a minimal incidence. Although sequential hemibody radiation has also been explored as \"systemic\" therapy, the results in prostatic carcinoma have not proved dramatic, and complications have been considerable. Hormonal therapy would certainly seem to be less life-threatening and equally beneficial according to present data. As a palliative treatment, however, hemibody irradiation is a pragmatic option for relieving prostatic cancer pain.\r"

  ".W": "Spinal cord or cauda equina compression from prostatic cancer is an oncologic emergency necessitating prompt evaluation and treatment. The strong correlation between pretreatment motor status and treatment outcome underscores the importance of immediate treatment before further neurologic deterioration and before the damage to the spinal cord becomes permanent. Patients with known osseous metastases should be alerted by their clinicians to seek medical help within hours should they develop weakness in an extremity. Prompt MRI of the entire spine should be done prior to treatment. Myelography should be reserved for those patients who cannot undergo a technically adequate or expeditious MRI study. The convenience of MRI relative to myelography allows clinicians to diagnose actual or impending spinal cord compression earlier. High-dose steroids (dexamethasone) should be instituted immediately, and endocrine therapy should be started if not already in use. Ambulatory and moderately paraparetic patients seem best treated initially with radiation alone. Immediate surgical decompression should be used in patients with an expected lifespan of at least 6 months who deteriorate during radiation, who have had previous radiation to the involved site, or who have a potentially correctable unstable spine. In addition, paraplegic patients or severely paraparetic patients with recent neurologic deterioration should be treated with immediate surgical decompression if they are judged reasonably able to tolerate the surgery. These patients should then receive postoperative radiation treatment.\r"

Although early, poorly controlled studies suggested enhanced survival with hormonal therapy, this view fell into disfavor as a result of the observations of the first and second VACURG studies. Recently, there has been a proliferation of experimental and clinical data supporting early androgen deprivation, including a reanalysis of the VACURG data, which suggests a survival advantage for younger patients with stage D disease and high-grade tumors who undergo androgen-ablative therapy at the time of diagnosis. The risk-benefit analysis presented in this review is strongly supportive of early hormonal therapy. Finally, long-term survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer will require the development of novel treatment strategies effective against androgen-resistant tumor cells and their use in concert with early androgen deprivation.\r"

The spine is both a weight-bearing structure and a housing for the spinal cord, and failure to consider both functions may lead to unsatisfactory treatment results. Treatment options include hormonal therapy, inhibitors of bone metabolism, glucocorticoid therapy, radiotherapy, halo-vest, surgical debridement, decompression and stabilization, and appropriate pain management and support. One must not lose sight of the fact that the goals are palliation and that ultimate demise is unavoidable in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\r"

Both the prostate and the regional nodes can be evaluated. The role of ultrasound is, at present, unclear. Second, the utility of CT has diminished with the emergence of high-quality MRI, but in situations in which MRI scans are inconclusive (e.g., in the assessment of paraaortic node disease, in which images are degraded by peristaltic movement), CT may be useful. Third, the choice of method for the assessment of nodal disease is a more difficult question. Although MRI and CT have replaced lymphography in most centers, the latter study, especially when combined with fine-needle aspiration biopsy, still is useful. Fourth, bone metastases are best assessed with scintigraphy, which can point to areas requiring supplemental plain radiography. An MRI study of the spine, although highly sensitive, is not practical. Fifth, MRI is superior to CT myelography in assessing spinal disease. Finally, the chest radiograph is the mainstay of assessing chest involvement.\r"

All other measures showed no difference between the two treatments. With total androgen blockade, 50% of the patients had disease progression at 1 year, and 45% were dead at 2 years. A review of the results of similar reported studies suggests no improvement or very modest improvement with total androgen blockade over testicular androgen ablation alone.\r"

In addition, the long half-life of a pure anti-androgen such as Casodex results in maintenance of high serum anti-androgen concentrations, which allays concern over the clinical significance of any small rise in serum testosterone concentrations. The anti-androgen of choice for the treatment of androgen-responsive diseases has yet to be defined. However, this choice should be based on extensive clinical evaluations of a drug as monotherapy. As always, the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the drug will be important factors in determining the anti-androgen of choice; however, favorable pharmacokinetics should be emphasized in the treatment of a disease in which high and sustained concentrations of antagonist must be present to prevent androgenic stimulation. Casodex, a pure anti-androgen with a relatively long half-life, produces objective and subjective responses similar to those of surgical or pharmacologic castration and is well tolerated. Its profile makes it a strong candidate for consideration as the future anti-androgen of choice in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.\r"

The most significant problem, incontinence, has occurred in 2 patients (10%) at three and four months, respectively, after surgery. Only 1 of these patients required temporary use of an external appliance. Leakage was due, in both cases, to a patulous efferent nipple valve. Both were repaired by plication of the nipple, and no new efferent limbs were constructed. In 1 patient (5%) prolapse of the afferent limb associated with reflux and pyelonephritis developed one year post-surgery. Stones have developed in 3 patients (15%).

Two patients with Stage C, who failed to received inguinal node radiotherapy, died of disease recurring in the inguinal area. Patients who received inguinal radiation (3 patients Stages B, C, and D1) had no regional recurrence. It is suggested that, for all female urethral carcinoma, bilateral ilioinguinal nodes be included in the radiation field.

A total of 91 such smears were studied of which 25 (27.5%) were positive for HPV antigen. Of the latter, 20 (80%) were positive for HPV 6/11 DNA, 3 (12%) were positive for HPV 16/18 DNA, one smear (4%) was positive for both, and one was negative for both. The technique of obtaining male urethral smears and immunostaining them for HPV antigen is simple, rapid, specific, and far more sensitive than conventional morphologic observations. Since antigen-positive cells are the source for spreading HPV infection, identifying individuals with such cells can help limit the spread of infection by alerting sexual partners, and also can be used to monitor the infectious status of the patient after therapy. DNA subtyping of HPV-positive patients may be useful in predicting the potential for malignant transformation which varies among the different HPV subtypes.\r"

Standard ureteroscopic instruments including graspers, baskets and dilatation balloons can be used with the laser system. Interchangeable optical fibers ranging from 200 to 400 micrometers deliver up to 120 mJ of energy to the stone's surface. For two weeks in 1989 an endourology clinic was held in upper Egypt. Eighty patients ranging in age from nine years to sixty-seven years old were evaluated and treated endoscopically. Endoscopes ranging from 6.9F to 12.5F were used to deliver the optical fiber. All stones visualized endoscopically were fragmented. Greater than 60 percent of the stones fragmented were composed of pure calcium oxalate monohydrate. Schistosoma hematobium was endemic among our study group. Bilharzial strictures of the distal ureter were noted in 30 percent of these patients. Treatment of these strictures using both balloon dilatation and graduated Teflon dilators is reviewed. Techniques in treating different types of ureteral calculi were explored. Large calcium oxalate dihydrate stones were treated most efficiently with the 3-point fragmentation technique. The shear off-center technique was used for the calcium oxalate monohydrate calculi. Variations in total energy delivered and frequency of pulsation allowed for prompt stone disimpaction as well as prevention of retrograde fragment migration. Concurrent use of stone baskets and graspers with the pulsed dye laser was explored.\r"

Of 29 patients with multilocular renal cysts, 24 underwent a renal-sparing procedure, and only 5 had radical nephrectomy. None of the histologic specimens showed evidence of immature renal tissue or neoplasia. Patients were followed from three months to eight years (mean, 39 months), and no evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease was found. Because it is difficult to distinguish multilocular renal cyst from cystic Wilms tumor and multicystic clear cell carcinoma on the basis of imaging studies alone, surgical intervention is the only effective method to differentiate multilocular renal cyst from a malignant lesion of the kidney.\r"

Epididymis is widely separated from testicle and moves freely from side to side. Its body and tail are ill formed and the epididymovasal angle is obtuse. Azoospermia was persistent in 3 patients and intermittent in 6 patients. Testicular biopsy showed tubular dilatation. Epididymopexy was performed in the 9 patients to fix the epididymis to testicle: 3 patients showed improvement in semen quality with two resultant pregnancies. Failures were due to advanced testicular damage. Infertility in mobile epididymis appears to result from obstruction of efferent ductules, testicular ischemia, and/or interference with sperm maturation, transport, or delivery.\r"

One hundred fifty-five intermediate care female patients with a mean age of 85.5 years were identified as being incontinent of urine at least once daily. After urologic evaluation, each patient was classified into one of four categories: incontinence with normal cystometrogram 68 (44%), detrusor instability (DI) 52 (34%), stress incontinence (SI) 27 (17%), or overflow incontinence (OI) 7 (4%). Thirteen weeks later, patients were again studied using simple water cystometry. At follow-up evaluation, 45 patients (33%) had urodynamic findings which differed from the initial evaluation. Of these women, 10 with DI, 12 with SI, and 2 with OI were found to have normal cystometric parameters at the time of follow-up study, while 19 (14%) who initially had normal cystometric findings had evidence of DI (11) or SI (3). Strong correlation between urinary incontinence in patients with normal cystometric findings and moderate to severe cognitive impairment was present. Simple urodynamic evaluation did identify patients with SI and OI who might benefit from specific therapy. Urodynamic evaluation of incontinent elderly female nursing home patients is indicated and may provide direction for planning treatment strategies.\r"

Twenty-seven (66%) of 41 patients with cTa-cT1 tumors and 9 (64%) of 14 patients with cTis responded, with a mean follow-up period of 30.5 months. Disease progression was noted in 8 (15%) of the patients and muscle invasive disease in 6. Patients with a history of three or more previous events of tumor recurrence, positive urinary cytology, and multicentric disease, all fared worse than patients without these characteristics (p less than 0.05). BCG is an effective agent in controlling superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, even in a high-risk group of patients who failed previous intravesical therapy. BCG should be employed in this group of patients prior to radical surgery.\r"

Overall survival for the patients was 51 percent at one year, 22 percent at three years, and 11 percent at five years. Age, sex, and side of primary tumor had no influence on survival. Improved survival was correlated with good PS, metastases limited to single organ, and removal of the primary tumor. With regard to histopathologic features in nephrectomized patients, low grade and stage were correlated with longer survival. These factors should be considered in the analysis of results of future clinical trials of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\r"

Studies using 14Carbon-nilutamide, radioimmunoassay, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are reviewed. In the rat, bioavailability by the oral route was complete. The majority of the plasma radioactivity was unchanged nilutamide up to six hours, t1/2 was seven hours, and clearance was 150 mL/hour/kg body weight. Metabolism studies identified 6 urinary metabolites. The major metabolites result from reduction of the nitro group initially to an hydroxylamine (17%) and then to a primary amino (26%) group. In normal volunteers the compound was rapidly absorbed, displayed linear kinetics over a dose range of 100-300 mg, and declined slowly in plasma with a terminal phase t1/2 of forty-three to forty-nine hours. In studies in 12 patients with advanced (Stage D) prostatic carcinoma, single-dose kinetics after 14C-nilutamide and kinetics with repetitive twice-daily dosing of two to seven weeks were measured. Terminal phase plasma t1/2 of unchanged nilutamide was 56 +/- 19 hours and of total radioactivity 87 +/- 27 hours (mean +/- SD). Area under the curve of plasma radioactivity was 23 to 38 percent unchanged nilutamide. Urinary excretion of radioactivity was slow and incomplete because the collection time was not long enough in regard to t1/2 (mean after 5 days, 62 +/- 10%) and consisted almost entirely of metabolites. Steady-state plasma levels of nilutamide were reached in about two weeks. It can be concluded that in humans, unlike other species, plasma decay of nilutamide is very slow. Elimination is almost exclusively by metabolism. Single-daily dosing is appropriate. Hepatic impairment could be expected to prolong plasma decay; renal impairment is likely to have little effect.\r"

  ".W": "Combination of antiandrogen treatment with surgical or medical castration should improve the efficacy of endocrine treatment of prostatic cancer by blocking the effects of adrenal androgens. A nonsteroidal antiandrogen, nilutamide, has shown promising results in preliminary open studies. In a short-term (29 days) comparison of nilutamide plus buserelin and buserelin plus placebo, nilutamide (300 mg/day), significantly reduced bone pain, and fewer patients experienced worsening pain than in the control group. The initial buserelin-induced increase in prostatic acid phosphatase was prevented by nilutamide, but there was a similar increase in testosterone and gonadotropin concentrations to that seen in the control group. Thus, nilutamide can prevent the tumor flare-up associated with the start of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) treatment, even though the endocrine responses are not affected. In three multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of castration and nilutamide involving 248 patients, the combination of nilutamide and castration decreased bone pain, improved performance status, and increased the number of patients with objective regression, compared with patients who were castrated but did not receive nilutamide. Nilutamide was generally well tolerated, though visual disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and alcohol intolerance were reported in patients receiving nilutamide. The results suggest that nilutamide improves the efficacy of castration in patients with prostatic cancer. Current studies are investigating the effects of this treatment on survival and the risk-benefit ratio.\r"

  ".U": "91126936\r", 
  ".W": "Antiandrogens are compounds able to block the effect of androgens directly on their target cells by inhibiting their binding to the androgen receptor (AR). Two chemical classes of antiandrogens are presently on the market or in clinical trials: steroids (cyproterone, megestrol acetates), and nonsteroids (flutamide, nilutamide). Steroid antiandrogens interact not only with AR but also with progestin and glucocorticoid receptors and thus give rise to progestin and glucocorticoid effects. By contrast, nonsteroid antiandrogens interact only with AR and are thus devoid of other hormonal or antihormonal activities. Nilutamide does not need to be transformed into an active metabolite, unlike flutamide, and interacts with dog, rat, and human prostate AR in vitro. Its kinetics lead to a prolonged interaction with AR in vivo after administration to rats. In prostate cancer treatment, it is necessary to combine an antiandrogen to surgical or chemical (estrogens, LH-RH agonists) castration to obtain a complete suppression of androgens. The antiandrogen will block specifically, at the target site, the trophic effect of adrenal androgens left intact by castration, and the secretion of which can only be suppressed by treatments (adrenalectomy, aminoglutethimide, ketoconazole) that also suppress corticoid synthesis. We have shown that nilutamide counteracts the trophic effect, on the prostate of castrated rats, of adrenal androgens administered continuously (minipumps) at circulating levels similar to those recorded in castrated men. Nilutamide will also impede the flare-up effect of the testosterone increase induced by LH-RH agonists at the beginning of treatment. We have shown in the rat treated with buserelin that the increase in prostate weight observed during the initial days of treatment by the LH-RH agonist can be inhibited by a combined treatment with nilutamide. This combined treatment \"nilutamide plus castration\" has been tested in an experimental androgen-dependent cancer model, the Shionogi tumor. The administration of nilutamide to mice, castrated twenty-four hours before the inoculation of tumor cells, delayed the appearance of tumors and reduced their number. Finally, the absence of androgen effect and the antiandrogen activity of the product were also demonstrated in human tumor cells in culture (T-47 D cells) transfected with the MMTV androgen-dependent promoter coupled with the CAT reporter gene.\r"

The technique has afforded the sensitive and specific detection of nucleic acid sequences associated with genetic and infectious diseases. However, PET processing conditions vary in their suitability for amplification. The authors have examined the effects of 11 fixatives at three fixation times. The effect of fixation was measured by the ability of the DNA in a treated tissue to serve as a template for the amplification of DNA fragments that ranged from 110 to 1,327 base pairs in length. Specimens fixed in acetone or 10% buffered neutral formalin were found to be best suited for subsequent analysis by PCR. A second group of fixatives, including Zamboni's, Clarke's, paraformaldehyde, formalin-alcohol-acetic acid, and methacarn, compromised amplification efficiency. Tissues treated with Carnoy's, Zenker's, or Bouin's, respectively, were even less desirable for amplification analysis.\r"

These features were examined in a series of 82 FNAB specimens from 52 patients with HCC and 30 patients with nonneoplastic lesions. With the use of a step-wise logistic regression analysis, three features were identified as predictive of HCC: increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (P = 0.001), trabecular pattern (P = 0.002), and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei (P = 0.03). When these three criteria were used, the sensitivity of diagnosing HCC by FNAB was 100%, and the specificity was 87%.\r"

This new method avoids the need for tissue fixation and combines the superior morphologic preservation of fixed embedded tissue with the reactivity of cryostat sections. This method ensures that diagnostic information from even the smallest biopsy specimen is maximized because a wide range of phenotypic markers can be applied and evaluated in relation to high-quality morphologic preservation of tissue. Biopsy specimens are stored at room temperature without loss of tissue-specific characteristics during storage.\r"

However, it is not widely recognized that cytokeratin is a very sensitive and reliable marker for all types of trophoblastic tissues. The authors have studied 100 cases of human placental tissue ranging in age from 2 to 40 weeks. Unlike hCG and hPL, which stain only the syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast, cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stains all three types of trophoblastic tissue. The staining of placental tissue for cytokeratin is strong and very consistent throughout pregnancy. Because of its high sensitivity and ability to stain cytotrophoblast, it is believed that it could be very useful in the study of the pathologic process of implantation sites, especially in tissue obtained from patients who present with missed and habitual abortions.\r"

The study group had no detectable masses by physical examination or mammography. Samples were prepared on membrane filters, Papanicolaou stained, and evaluated cytomorphologically. Three hundred seventy-eight of 408 (92.6%) possible quadrants were sampled; cellular material was obtained from 290 (76.7%) quadrants. PBD was identified in 20 of the 51 women (39.2%). When epithelium was obtained, nuclear area, perimeter, and diameter were measured with the use of computerized image analysis. Nuclei in samples containing atypical hyperplasia showed significant differences in these parameters when compared with cells from samples containing normal epithelium or benign hyperplasia.

  ".W": "The CD45 family contains protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity and is expressed in one or more of its isoforms on all lymphohematopoietic cells. Considerable work has focused on CD45 expression by lymphoid cells, but minimal work has involved granulocytes. Granulocytic, or myeloid, cell differentiation is accompanied by a number of morphologic and immunophenotypic changes. This study used flow cytometric and immunocytochemical methods in conjunction with morphologic assessment to investigate the expression of CD45 isoforms during differentiation of normal and malignant granulocytic cells. On normal bone marrow cells, the quantity of surface CD45 did not change during earlier stages but did increase significantly at the terminal stages (bands and polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]). CD45RO (the low relative molecular mass [Mr] isoform) was very dimly expressed on immature cells but became increasingly brighter beginning at approximately the myelocyte stage. The high Mr isoform (CD45RA) was virtually absent from the cell surface at all stages. Only a small percentage (3-15%) of PMNs expressed surface CD45RA. However, there was a cytoplasmic pool of each isoform associated with membrane-bound granules found throughout differentiation, with remarkable increases in expression at the terminal stages. In the case of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), most cases expressed surface CD45RA with, or without, CD45RO, regardless of their French-American-British (FAB) classification. This appeared to be a stable process at diagnosis and relapse in individual patients and may therefore serve as a diagnostic aid. The biologic significance of this aberrant expression of CD45RA by malignant cells is unknown but raises important questions regarding the cellular processes of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in normal and malignant cells.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report on the extensive characterization, on normal and pathologic tissues, of the T-cell-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) A6, which the authors previously found to identify a fixation- and paraffin-embedding-resistant epitope. A6 reacted with most T lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans' cells of normal tissues and with peripheral T-cell lymphomas (31 of 34), Ki-1+ lymphomas (12 of 18), and T-cell leukemias (1 of 5). All cases of X and non-X histiocytosis examined and monocytic leukemias with mature phenotype only were A6 positive. Three of 47 cases of B-cell lymphoma and leukemia were labeled. Hairy cell leukemias, multiple myelomas, and Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells were negative. The A6 reactivity was preserved with different fixatives (formalin, Bouin's fluid, Carnoy's fixative, and B5) and decalcification procedures and was slightly enhanced by trypsin digestion. The pattern of reactivity of A6 was similar to that obtained with MoAb UCHL-1, recognizing the CD45RO determinant of leukocyte common antigen; however, in pathologic tissues, A6 labeled a higher percentage of cells than UCHL-1. Cross-blocking and enzyme digestion studies (Pronase E [Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO] and neuraminidase [Sigma Chemical]) indicated that the two MoAbs may identify close epitopes on the same molecule. In conclusion, the authors' study indicates that A6 is an excellent reagent for detection of the CD45RO molecule on paraffin-embedded normal and pathologic tissues.\r"

Two distinct FDC patterns were distinguishable in the neoplastic areas: pattern A, showing FDC networks occupied by nongerminal center cells, often expanded and disrupted; and pattern B, with FDCs rare or lacking. Pattern A, with follicle-occupying cells represented by epithelioid and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L and H) cells, was found in about 90% of the cases of nodular lymphocyte predominance type and in about half of the cases of nodular sclerosis type, with the follicle-occupying cells being lacunar cells. In the group of mixed cellularity type, approximately one-fifth of the cases exhibited pattern A and in these cases the follicle-occupying cells were Sternberg-Reed, Hodgkin's, and epithelioid cells. The presence of follicular structures, although abnormal, is a more common occurrence in HD than is appreciable with the use of conventional histologic methods.\r"

One patient who rejected the graft showed rapid reappearance of host cells after transient donor marrow engraftment. Host cells were detected at low levels in 49 of the remaining 50 patients. Host peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) decreased with time and reached a plateau at 1.0 +/- 0.2% within four weeks after transplantation, while the percentage of host granulocytes (GRAN) reached a plateau at background level. The mean absolute numbers of host PBMC or GRAN were less than 0.015 x 10(9)/L and did not vary significantly over the period studied. Neither the percentages nor the absolute numbers of host PBMC or GRAN were significantly affected by HLA-matching, TBI dose-intensity, pretransplant remission status, subsequent development of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease or relapse after transplantation. The authors conclude that it is common to find a few residual host cells in the peripheral blood of allogeneic marrow transplant recipients, and the presence of these cells has no clinical significance.\r"

Its efficacy, however, is reduced in the theoretical event that red blood cells (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hgb) undergo a concomitant analytical drift while mean corpuscular volume (MCV) remains unaffected, so that a null effect is registered on the related erythrocytic indices: mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). This particular phenomenon has been observed on the Technicon System H6000. Routine daily work was kept in control through the use of commercial controls and fresh blood samples: a reproducible positive drift of two directly measured erythrocytic parameters (RBC and Hgb) and of the calculated hematocrit (Hct) was observed proportional to the time of continuous use of the instrument. The usefulness of Bull's QC scheme was greatly reduced: it failed to detect \"out of control\" situation in 38%, 15%, and 13% of cases in the monitoring of MCV, MCH, and MCHC, respectively, when compared with the traditional 2 SD limits on QC samples.\r"

  ".W": "The monitoring of heparin anticoagulation is fraught with difficulties because of the need for repetitive venipunctures and the vagaries of sample handling and processing. The authors evaluated a new aPTT monitoring system with the potential to eliminate many of these difficulties. The Ciba Corning Diagnostics 512 Coagulation Monitor (CCD monitor) is a hand-held portable instrument that can measure an aPTT from a fingerstick sample of capillary whole blood. Fingerstick aPTTs from 319 subjects (including controls and individuals on heparin and/or warfarin) were compared to venipuncture-derived standard laboratory plasma aPTTs using different aPTT reagents on conventional instruments. The correlation coefficients between fingerstick and standard aPTTs (0.79-0.83) were the same as the correlation coefficient between standard laboratory aPTTs using different reagents (0.79). When venipuncture-derived whole blood was compared to fingerstick samples on the new instrument, the correlation coefficient was excellent (0.93). A high degree of precision, as demonstrated by low coefficients of variations, was shown for within-day and between-day testing using the CCD monitor and normal controls. This capillary whole blood, aPTT system is the first to provide the clinician with a means of rapidly and reliably assessing the anticoagulant response to heparin therapy at the bedside, and its use may ultimately lead to more efficient and effective therapy overall.\r"

Dialysis to remove small molecular weight (less than 14,000) inhibitors did not enhance survival. Co-cultivation with Ureaplasma urealyticum and the addition of glycogen improved survival. Maximum recovery from urine required anaerobic incubation on enriched agar medium (pH 6.5-7.5) for at least 48 hours. Gardnerella vaginalis survives poorly in human urine at 37 degrees C. Culture for these bacteria requires prolonged anaerobic incubation.\r"

High titer IgG antibodies reached the end point sooner with EIA than with RIA (10(-3) versus greater than 10(-6)). When IgM anti-HDV was present without accompanying IgG anti-HDV, EIA failed to identify the antibody. Presence of high titer rheumatoid factor in the serum and lipemic samples produced false-positive results by EIA.

Perturbation of membrane integrity altered both the localization of binding and the number of sperm cells positive for bound antibodies. In specimens from selected infertility patients, 21.6% of the females and 40.8% of the males had significant levels of antisperm antibodies. Differences in the incidence of isoimmunity between female partners of antibody-positive or antibody-negative males and differences in the localization of antigens targeted by serum versus seminal plasma antibodies in men support the idea that, in some cases, immunity to sperm cells may be the result of altered sperm antigens.\r"

The Accu-Check performed better than the Glucoscan at venous plasma glucose levels less than 1 g/L. The mean error of Glucoscan determinations was significantly greater and biased positive when the measurement was performed within 4 hours of eating, whereas no such effect was seen with Accu-Check error. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the Glucoscan measurement was independently influenced by both venous plasma glucose and prandial state, whereas the Accu-Check II measurement was not dependent on either variable. The within-run precision for both glucose meters were comparable.\r"

The authors have demonstrated a linear relationship (r2 = 0.98) between serum levels of total and bound phenytoin in 56 patients with seizure disorders. No significant correlations were observed when total phenytoin and albumin levels were compared independently to measured concentrations of free phenytoin or percent free phenytoin. A good correlation (r2 = 0.89) existed between free phenytoin levels and [total phenytoin]/[albumin] ratios in patients with normal or elevated albumin levels, but significantly weaker correlations were found in patients with hypoalbuminemia. Thus, [total phenytoin]/[albumin] ratios may have clinical value in predicting free phenytoin levels in uncomplicated patients without hypoalbuminemia.\r"

  ".W": "Nonpropulsive esophageal contractions radiologically described as tertiary contractions or \"corkscrew\" esophagus suggest the presence of an underlying motility disorder and may lead to impaired acid clearance. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence and role of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in patients with tertiary contractions. Thirty-five consecutive patients with spontaneous, repetitive, nonpropulsive esophageal contractions noted on esophagography were studied with endoscopy, infusion esophageal manometry, and 24-h ambulatory pH monitoring. All patients had esophageal symptoms, mainly dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain, but only three were found to have esophagitis by endoscopy and biopsy. Nineteen patients had repetitive, nonlumen-obliterating, nonperistaltic (tertiary) contractions, six had corkscrew esophagus, and 10 had forceful, lumen-obliterating simultaneous contractions (rosary bead esophagus). Twenty patients (58%) had GER by pH criteria with mean values: % time pH less than 4, 40.9; %upright pH less than 4, 41; %supine pH less than 4, 44.3%; number of episodes with greater than 5 min of pH less than 4, 12. Esophageal motility revealed \"nutcracker\" esophagus in eight, low LESP in two, and nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 10. Symptoms or severity of nonperistaltic contractions did not correlate with GER. Radiologically demonstrable free reflux or the presence of heartburn did not predict GER. We conclude that 1) GER occurs in up to 58% of patients with nonpropulsive (tertiary) esophageal contractions on esophagography, and may play a role in the induction of abnormal peristaltic activity of the esophageal body; 2) GER is usually not associated with endoscopic evidence of esophagitis or characteristic symptoms, and is recognized by 24-h pH monitoring. We speculate that detection and treatment of GER may improve the symptomatic management of patients with nonpropulsive esophageal contractions.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring is useful for the quantitative measurement of gastroesophageal reflux and for the demonstration of a temporal relationship between symptoms and reflux. The symptom index, a numerical score, was developed to quantify the association between symptoms and reflux. Because the symptom index primarily assesses the specificity of a patient's reflux symptoms, we propose to refer to this score as the symptom specificity index. Because of certain limitations of this score, we developed and evaluated a new score, the symptom sensitivity index, that quantifies the subject's sensitivity for reflux. Fifty-two consecutive patients, referred to our laboratory for ambulatory 24-h pH recording were studied. Beside the conventional reflux variables, both indexes were calculated. Although a statistically significant correlation between the indexes was found, discordance between the specificity and sensitivity indexes was seen in 17 patients (33%). Based on the findings in this study we advocate that the symptom sensitivity index should be used, in addition to the symptom specificity index, and incorporated in future pH studies to optimalize the interpretation of the results.\r"

However, the median integrated 24-h plasma gastrin concentration was significantly higher when fed than when fasting, 284 pmol.h/L and 114 pmol.h/L, respectively (p less than 0.01). There appears to be a normal circadian rhythm for intragastric acidity: feeding appears to cause an acute decrease of intragastric acidity and to release gastrin, which in turn causes a compensatory rise of intragastric acidity. The results of this study suggest that the need to reinstate \"normal\" intragastric acidity is the drive to food-induced gastric acid secretion.\r"

Small bowel enteroscopy (SBE) has been reported useful in the nonsurgical evaluation of the small intestine in these patients, but findings may be limited because of incomplete small bowel intubation and a lack of tip deflection. Twenty-three patients underwent 25 SBE exams and subsequently had 25 IOE exams during surgical exploration for continued bleeding. Patients' bleeding histories averaged 2 yr, with an average transfusion requirement of 27 units. Findings on IOE were the same as with SBE in 17/22 (77%) of examinations. We conclude that SBE and IOE are comparable in depth of insertion and ability to detect small vascular ectasias. Both procedures missed pathology due to limited visibility and the evanescent nature of ectasias. Long-term success in abolishing bleeding with these combined techniques can be expected in 55% of these patients. SBE should precede surgery, since the finding of diffuse ectasias precludes any benefit from operative intervention.\r"

Conversely, of patients with obstruction on plain radiographs, 42% had either normal enteroclysis studies or only minor adhesions. Enteroclysis correctly predicted the presence of obstruction in 100%, the absence of obstruction in 88%, the level (proximal vs distal) of obstruction in 89%, and the etiology of obstruction in 86% of operated patients.

The characteristic histological feature of both the active and healed duodenal ulcer was the appearance of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive epithelial cells at the edge of the ulcers. Electron microscopy revealed that these cells were similar to a special type of mucus-secreting cell in the antrum (surface mucous cell). Their mucus granules contained mainly neutral glycoproteins. Helicobacter pylori were found attached to these cells in tissue specimens from 12 of 30 patients (40%). The mucous structure destroyed during the ulcerative phase regained its normal net-like structure after treatment. The ultrastructural healing process of duodenal ulcer was characterized by the presence of gastric metaplasia, by stunted microvilli of the duodenal epithelium (p less than 0.001 vs. control group), and an increased number of lysosome-like bodies (p less than 0.001 vs. control group) of the epithelial cells. These results were independent of the type of treatment, and showed that the repair mechanisms were incomplete after a 4-wk period of treatment.\r"

The site of tumor location, Dukes' stage, and serum CEA level did not predict a certain DNA stemline. However, irrespective of the ploidy pattern, a serum CEA level greater than 5.0 was associated with a higher mortality and poor 5-yr survival (p less than 0.005). Similarly, advanced Dukes' stage was associated with higher mortality (p less than 0.05). Forty-six percent of the patients with lesions that were Dukes' B2 or advanced stage received adjuvant therapy. Eighty-five percent of this subgroup of patients died; 18% of these patients had aneuploid tumors. The role of FCM in the assessment of prognosis of CRC deserves further clinical evaluation in a randomized control trial.\r"

Problems are encountered if there are larger stones or a duct stenosis. New conservative therapies do serve as an alternative to surgical intervention for those few patients in whom endoscopic measures have failed. Stone fragmentation can be achieved by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, and remaining fragments can be removed endoscopically. So far, authors of most reports on the successful disintegration of common bile duct stones used the Dornier lithotripter. Stone localization is thus achieved with x-rays, and the shock waves are generated by an underwater spark discharge. We report on our experiences and results with extracorporeal piezoelectric shock wave lithotripsy (EPL) in 19 patients with complicated bile duct stones. With this lithotripter, stones are visualized by ultrasound, and shock waves are produced by a piezoelectric acoustic generator. Fragmentation was achieved in 84.2%, and complete stone removal in 78.9%. These results show that piezoelectric lithotripsy is also a useful method for the treatment of complicated bile duct stones, as has already been proved for the electrohydraulic- and electromagnetic-generated shock waves systems. However, the renunciation of general anesthesia and the need for analgesia or sedation in only 25% of the treatments render this lithotripter system attractive, especially for elderly and frail patients.\r"

Results were compared in four subgroups (ALC, N = 26; AnLC, N = 45; nALC, N = 18; and nAnLC, N = 43). Volume of duodenal juice and bicarbonate output (BO) were increased and maximal bicarbonate concentration was decreased in ALC, compared with those in normal controls. Comparison of LC and nLC indicated that the volume, BO, and amylase output (AO) were greater in LC than in nLC of alcoholic etiology, but not in those of nonalcoholic etiology. The initial disappearance rate (KICG) of indocyanine green (ICG) excretion correlated with a parameter of CS test in alcoholic liver disease (vs. volume: r = -0.51, p less than 0.01 vs BO: r = -0.40, p less than 0.01), but not in nonalcoholic liver disease. Concurrent chronic pancreatitis with pain and definite exocrine insufficiency was observed in only one ALC patient and in four AnLC patients, but in none of the nonalcoholics. In alcoholic liver disease, exocrine pancreatic secretion tends to increase with severity of liver damage, but concurrence of definite chronic pancreatitis is not correlated with the severity.\r"

On the other hand, HCC lesions were found on CT scan in 14 of 26 patients (53.8%) and in 27 of 35 patients (77.1%) by angiography. With MR imaging, HCC nodules were demonstrated in 21 of 31 patients on both T1 and T2 weighted images, and 13 of 21 patients (61.9%) were shown to have low intensity areas or iso intensity areas on T1 weighted image, whereas the other eight patients (38.1%) were shown to have high intensity areas. All 21 patients were shown to have high intensity areas on T2 weighted image. Among 15 resected cases, four patients had a high intensity area on T1 weighted image, and a significant fatty change was noted in HCC nodules by histological study of the resected specimen.

The rate of survival and variables correlating with survival varied according to the group. At 48 months, 70% of the patients with fatty liver were alive, 58% in the alcoholic hepatitis group, 49% in cirrhosis, and 35% in alcoholic hepatitis superimposed upon cirrhosis. Within group one, deaths were due to causes unrelated to liver disease. In the alcoholic hepatitis group, factors significantly correlating with survival were ascites, alanine amino-transferase levels, grams of alcohol consumed, continuation of alcohol intake, and clinical severity of disease. Survival in patients of group three correlated significantly with prothrombin time and histologic severity score. Patients with combined cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis exhibited the worst prognosis, with the most significant predictors of survival being age, grams of alcohol consumed, the ratio of serum aminotransferases (AST:ALT) and the histologic and clinical severity of the disease. Although a different pattern of correlates was observed for each pathologic level of injury, knowledge of the various correlates aids in prognostic assessment.\r"

Ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic mass in the liver, and ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of the mass revealed that it was composed of fibrous connective tissue infiltrated with plasma cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Accordingly, a diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver was made. Marked reduction in the size of the lesion and a decrease of the levels of the CRP and ALP occurred without specific treatment. We emphasize the importance of ultrasonically guided aspiration biopsy in diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver without the need for surgery.\r"

Body tonicity decreases (approximately 10 mOsm/kg) very early in pregnancy due to decrements in the osmotic thresholds for AVP release and thirst. In addition, the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of AVP markedly increases between gestational week 10 and midpregnancy, and is paralleled by the appearance and increase of circulating cystine aminopeptidase (vasopressinase), while the MCR of 1-deamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP), an analogue resistant to inactivation by the enzyme, changes little in pregnancy. These increases (MCR of AVP and plasma vasopressinase) may explain certain syndromes of transient diabetes insipidus (DI) that complicate gestation. Finally, mechanisms responsible for the altered osmoregulation in pregnancy are obscure, but chorionic gonadotropin may be involved in the changes during human gestation.\r"

Two hundred forty pregnancies in 166 Japanese women who delivered between 1970 and 1988 were analyzed. There were 206 (86%) live births, 14 (6%) perinatal deaths, and 20 (8%) spontaneous abortions. Perinatal loss was greatest in women with hypertension and/or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 70 mL/min before conception. Pregnancy did not appear to adversely affect the underlying glomerular disease if GFR was greater than 70 mL/min and blood pressure was below 140/90 mm Hg. However, with moderately impaired renal function (creatinine greater than 124 mumol/L [1.4 mg/dL] or GFR less than 50 mL/min), the long-term prognosis was poorer, despite generally favorable obstetrical outcomes. Gravidas with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis had the highest rates of hypertension (29%) and decreased renal function (33%) at final follow-up, ie, the type and severity of glomerulonephritis had a major impact on clinical course.\r"

Fetal outcome was poor in the presence of uncontrolled hypertension, nephrotic range proteinuria, and/or impaired renal function at conception or early in gestation, whatever the type of renal disease. An accelerated, more rapid than expected, worsening of maternal renal function was observed in five GN patients of whom four (two IgA, two MPGN) had serum creatinine (Scr) levels greater than 160 mumol/L (1.8 mg/dL) early in gestation, and in five patients with reflux nephropathy whose Scr at conception ranged from 180 to 490 mumol/L (2.0 to 5.5 mg/dL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exacerbations or relapse occur during the course of pregnancy and immediately postpartum in 25% to 60% of pregnancies. However, the likelihood of increased clinical activity of SLE during pregnancy is influenced by signs of activity present at onset of pregnancy. In the absence of signs of clinical activity for at least 6 months before conception, relapses occur in about one third, whereas in patients with clinical activity at onset of pregnancy, persistent activity or exacerbations occur in approximately two thirds. Fetal survival in these patients parallels the incidence of SLE activity: 85% to 95% in the group with inactive disease at conception and 50% to 80% in subjects with active disease at onset of pregnancy. The introduction of an assay for anticardiolipids has led to a new concept for the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, namely immune-related thrombosis. Recent studies suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in clinical episodes in SLE, involving late fetal death and maternal arterial and venous thrombosis.\r"

Pregnancy is invariably complicated and poses excessive risks, with an uncertain and low chance of success. Even when therapeutic abortion is excluded, the live birth outcome at best is 19%. Renal transplantation usually reverses abnormal reproductive function and comprehensive pre-pregnancy counseling is essential, with discussion of all implications, including the harsh realities of long-term maternal survival. In this survey of 2,309 pregnancies in 1,594 women, therapeutic abortion was undertaken in 27% of conceptions and the spontaneous abortion rate was 13%. Of the conceptions that continued beyond the first trimester, 92% ended successfully. In most, renal function was augmented in pregnancy, with transient deterioration in late pregnancy (with or without proteinuria). Permanent renal impairment occurred in 15% of pregnancies. There was a 30% chance of developing hypertension, preeclampsia or both. Preterm delivery occurred in 50%, and intrauterine growth retardation in 25% of pregnancies. Despite its pelvic location, the transplanted kidney rarely produced dystocia and was not injured during vaginal delivery. Cesarean section should be reserved for obstetric reasons only. Neonatal complications include respiratory distress syndrome, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, adrenocortical insufficiency, and infection. No predominant or frequent developmental abnormalities have been described and data on infancy and childhood are encouraging. For the future more work is needed to improve pre-pregnancy assessment criteria, to understand the mechanisms of gestational renal dysfunction and proteinuria, to assess the side effects and implications of immunosuppression in pregnancy, and to elucidate the remote effects of pregnancy on both renal prognosis and the offspring.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy has existed about the relative contributions of subendothelial \"fibrinoid\" deposits and endothelial cell swelling to the thickened glomerular capillary wall and reduced lumen in preeclampsia. A morphometric analysis of the ultrastructural changes in the glomerulus in preeclampsia showed that subendothelial fibrinoid deposits were a significant feature of biopsies during pregnancy, but were absent in many biopsies in the postpartum period. These deposits disappear progressively in the first week after delivery. Capillary wall changes with reduplication of glomerular capillary walls and mesangial interposition are another prominent feature of preeclampsia. These changes resolve gradually and may present for as long as 18 months. Foam cells in glomeruli are rarely found in biopsies during pregnancy, but appear during resorption of the subendothelial deposits in the postpartum period. Electron-dense droplets in glomerular epithelial cells are a characteristic feature of preeclampsia. Immunogold labeling demonstrates that they contain albumen, immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, and complement. Fibrinogen is usually present in an inner electron-dense core in a droplet. IgM is usually in a relatively translucent outer part of the droplet. Other proteins are diffusely distributed. Segmental hyalinosis is a change that closely resembles the changes of preeclampsia, and segmental lesions may appear during preeclampsia and disappear after pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "It is taken for granted that severe hypertension in pregnancy should be treated, although the principle has not been formally tested by properly controlled trials. There is less certainty about treating mild to moderate hypertension (140/90 to 169/109 mm Hg). The risk of chronic hypertension in pregnancy depends on that of superimposed preeclampsia, which must be prevented by control of the blood pressure if antihypertensive treatment is to be beneficial. There is not a priori reason why lowering the blood pressure should have this effect. Most of the trials of treatment have been too small to provide conclusive answers. Usually treatment has been started too late to give a realistic expectation of influencing the evolution of superimposed preeclampsia. However, the largest trial of the early use of methyldopa in women with mild chronic hypertension, showed clearly that treatment does not prevent the superimposition of preeclampsia. beta-Adrenergic blocking agents, if used from the second start of the trimester, are associated with a major risk of severe growth retardation and are therefore contraindicated. Methyldopa has the best safety record, which includes long-term follow-up to assess the development of children exposed to methyldopa in utero. The ineffectiveness of antihypertensive drugs in preventing or ameliorating preeclampsia needs to be contrasted with the consistent evidence for the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy. This is consistent with the increasing evidence that preeclampsia is not primarily, or even necessarily, a hypertensive disease.\r"

  ".W": "To further define the relationship between dialyzer reuse and the removal of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) during dialysis, 26 patients who received hemodialysis were studied. Thirteen patients were dialyzed with conventional cuprophane dialyzers, and thirteen patients were dialyzed with high-flux polysulfone dialyzers. Patients in each group were dialyzed with only new dialyzers during the primary-use phase of the study, and reprocessed dialyzers during the reuse phase. Dialyzers were used six times during the reuse phase. Serum beta 2M levels were measured both predialysis and postdialysis, and adjusted for fluid loss. Dialysis with conventional cuprophane new dialyzers during the primary-use phase of the study resulted in a 3.3% increase in serum beta 2M levels, and a 2.4% increase in serum beta 2M levels during the reuse phase. The difference in the change of the concentration of beta 2M between primary-use and reuse phases was not statistically significant. Dialysis with high-flux polysulfone new dialyzers during the primary-use phase was associated with a decrease of 59.5% in the mean postdialysis concentration of serum beta 2M compared with the predialysis level. A corresponding decrease of 62.6% in serum beta 2M levels was observed after dialysis with high-flux polysulfone reprocessed dialyzers during the reuse phase. These data show no evidence of an adverse effect on the clearance of beta 2M during dialysis from the reuse of dialyzers up to six times. The results confirm previous studies that have reported that high-flux dialysis with polysulfone dialyzers removes substantial amounts of beta 2M, and dialysis with conventional cuprophane dialyzers does not.\r"

Owing to its higher affinity to deferoxamine (DFO) and higher plasma concentrations, Fe could impair Al removal in cases of simultaneous body burden. Fe and Al plasma kinetics and mass transfer were therefore studied in 12 uremic patients with different Fe and Al status: six with normal ferritin levels (less than 400 micrograms/L [ng/mL]), and Al 1.4 to 4.7 mumol/L (40 to 131 micrograms/L) (group A); six with increased ferritin (greater than 2,000 micrograms/L), and Al 1.7 to 17 mumol/L (47 to 476 micrograms/L) (group B). DFO (40 and 80 mg/kg in a random sequence) was administered once a week during the first hour of the first hemofiltration (HF). The results show that in both groups and with both DFO doses, maximum Fe and Al mass transfer was achieved in the first and second HF, respectively. The 80-mg/kg dose of DFO significantly raised Al mass transfer in both groups, whereas Fe mass transfer was only slightly affected. Even though plasma Fe levels were almost always higher than Al, Al mass transfer eventually exceeded that of Fe, in both Fe-normal and Fe-overload patients. The bias towards Al in mass transfer was enhanced in both groups in the second HF, and at the higher DFO doses. Thus, DFO once a week reduced Fe loss to less than 30 mumol/wk in patients with normal ferritin levels. In both Fe and Al overloaded patients, Al can be removed, and Al mass transfer may often exceed Fe mass transfer, depending on the degree of tissue burden, the time from DFO infusion, and the DFO dose.\r"

The plasma levels of calcitriol (21.9 +/- 1.6 pg/mL, n = 7, v control, 37.4 +/- 2.9 pg/mL, P less than 0.001), metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of calcitriol (0.45 +/- .01 mL/min/kg v control, 0.58 +/- .02 mL/min/kg, P less than 0.001), and production rate (PR) of calcitriol (14.2 +/- 1.0 ng/kg/d v control, 31.8 +/- 3.2 ng/kg/d, P less than 0.001) were significantly lower in patients with moderate renal failure (average creatinine clearance, 0.59 +/- 0.01 mL/s [35.1 +/- 6.1 mL/min]) when compared with the respective values of normal control subjects. The MCR of calcitriol was determined again in patients with renal failure after they received calcitriol, 1 microgram/d, for 1 week. The MCR remained unchanged (0.46 +/- .04 mL/min/kg, n = 7) and plasma levels of calcitriol were increased to 34.6 +/- 2.77 pg/mL. The mechanism by which the MCR of calcitriol decreases in renal failure is partly due to the presence of inhibitory factors of degradation enzymes in uremic plasma. When the ultrafiltrates of uremic plasma obtained from hemodialysis patients were infused to normal Sprague-Dawley rats, the MCRs of calcitriol (0.20 +/- .01 mL/min/kg, n = 6) were markedly suppressed in comparison to those of rats infused with the ultrafiltrates of normal plasma (0.37 +/- .01 mL/min/kg, n = 6, P less than 0.001). The uremic plasma also contained factors that inhibit the synthesis of calcitriol. We conclude that metabolic degradation of calcitriol is decreased in patients with renal failure, and uremic plasma contains inhibitory factors that suppress the synthesis and degradation of calcitriol.\r"

To define the causes and outcomes of community-acquired acute renal failure, we undertook a prospective study of patients admitted to the hospital with acute elevations in serum creatinine concentrations. Over a 17-month period, all admission serum creatinine determinations were screened for patients with values greater than 177 mumol/L (2 mg/dL). These values were compared with baseline creatinines to select patients with an acute elevation in serum creatinine occurring outside the hospital. One hundred patients were entered into the study, with an overall incidence of 1% of hospital admissions. Seventy percent of the patients had prerenal azotemia, 11% had intrinsic acute renal failure, 17% had obstruction, and 2% could not be classified. Mean peak serum creatinine (318 +/- 18 mumol/L [3.6 +/- 0.2 mg/dL]) and mortality (7%) was lowest in the group with prerenal azotemia. In this group, volume contraction due to vomiting, decreased fluid intake, diarrhea, fever, glucosuria, or diuretics was the most common underlying cause. The group with intrinsic acute renal failure had the most severe renal failure and the highest mortality (55%). Although ischemic acute tubular necrosis is the most common cause of hospital-acquired intrinsic acute renal failure, this etiology was seen in only one patient. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity and infection-related causes were the most common underlying etiologies of intrinsic acute renal failure. Obstructive renal failure had a mortality of 24% and was most commonly due to benign prostatic hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This experience, and a previous similar case report, prompted a review of all our 27 transplant patients treated with enalapril. Of these, 10 patients (37%) had developed an otherwise unaccounted for anemia: the pre-enalapril hematocrit value was 0.42 +/- 0.01 and it decreased to the nadir value of 0.33 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001) within 12.3 +/- 0.9 weeks after initiation of 9 +/- 2.4 mg of enalapril daily; enalapril was stopped in seven patients and their anemia resolved within 9.1 +/- 0.7 weeks to a final hematocrit value of 0.40 +/- 0.01. The remaining three patients were maintained on enalapril at their physicians' discretion, without further decrease in hematocrit values. No appreciable changes in drug regimens, clinical course, or other laboratory parameters were noted during this period. A causal relationship between enalapril and anemia was suggested by the effect of drug withdrawal and rechallenge on hematocrit in one of the patients. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics between those patients who did (group I) and those who did not (group II) develop enalapril-associated anemia, with the exception of a normal hematocrit value of 0.42 +/- 0.01 in group I versus a lower hematocrit value of 0.36 +/- 0.02 in group II (P less than 0.05). We conclude that enalapril should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia following renal transplantation. Susceptibility to this effect might emanate from the immunosuppressed state.\r"

When available, core biopsy histopathology was used to confirm the final diagnosis. Fifty-seven (80%) of the aspirates yielded adequate material. A clinical diagnosis of acute cellular rejection (ACR) was made in 21 patients, 18 (78%) of whom showed confirmatory immune activation on FNAB. The clinical diagnosis of either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or cyclosporine toxicity was confirmed in 31 (91%) of 34 aspirates. In eight aspirates, the cytological diagnosis was different than that made clinically. Humorally mediated vascular rejection, and lymphocytosis secondary to causes other than rejection, such as viral infection, were considered as possible causes of this discrepancy. Provided that adequate samples are obtained. FNAB is valuable in the clinical management of renal transplant patients. Its accuracy should not be overestimated and the results obtained should be evaluated in the light of the overall clinical picture.\r"

At 1 week, inulin clearance rates (Cin) in TxT4 and Tx rats were 0.367 +/- 0.171 and 0.120 +/- 0.036 mL/min, respectively, different at P less than 0.01. Corresponding single-nephron filtration rate (SNGFR), glomerular plasma flow (QA), glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure (delta P), and proximal tubular reabsorption (Jv) were all reduced in Tx compared with TxT4 rats (P less than 0.01). Protein excretion (UPROT) was 151 +/- 40 in TxT4 rats, and 9 +/- 5 mg/d in Tx animals. Glomerular mesangial matrix expansion and focal tubulointerstitial changes were more frequent in TxT4 than Tx rats. By 4 weeks, Cin, SNGFR, QA, glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) and Jv were similar in Tx and TxT4. Only glomerular capillary pressure (PGC) remained lower in Tx rats (35 +/- 3 v 50 +/- 3 mm Hg in TxT4, P less than 0.001). UPROT was 161 +/- 24 in TxT4 and 17 +/- 12 mg/d in Tx rats. While 7% +/- 4% of glomeruli showed focal sclerosis in TxT4 rats, there was none in the Tx group. Maximal glomerular planar area increased between 1 and 4 weeks in the TxT4 group, but not in the Tx group. However, this measurement was not significantly different between TxT4 and Tx glomeruli at 1 or 4 weeks. Minimal focal tubulointerstitial changes were found in TxT4, but there were not progressive from those observed at 1 week. The reduced PGC at 1 week was the result of a disproportionately greater increase in afferent (RA) than efferent arteriolar resistance (RE) in Tx rats (P less than 0.025); however, at 4 weeks, both RA and RE had decreased to values identical to those in TxT4 animals and the lower PGC in Tx rats was the result of a reduced mean arterial pressure. In conclusion, a reduced PGC was the sole functional correlate of decreased proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis afforded by Tx in this partial nephrectomy model. Suppression of either nephrectomy-related hypertrophy or tubulointerstitial injury by Tx could not be excluded as at least partially protective factors.\r"

  ".W": "Rats are an excellent animal model in which to study the changes in renal hemodynamics associated with normal pregnancy. Midterm pregnant rats exhibit a maximal renal vasodilation leading to increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF). Micropuncture studies in midterm pregnant Munich-Wistar rats have shown that single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) increases, due entirely to increases in plasma flow and, importantly, glomerular capillary blood pressure (PGC) remains unchanged in normotensive pregnancy, due to parallel and proportionally similar reductions in preglomerular (RA) and efferent (RE) arteriolar resistance. Despite the chronic gestational renal vasodilation, pregnancy in normotensive rats with either normal kidneys or a variety of underlying diseases, causes no adverse changes in renal function, perhaps because the glomeruli are protected from damaging high PGC. In the presence of systemic hypertension, the renal vasodilation of pregnancy could put the maternal kidney at risk of injury due to increases in PGC. There are few renal functional studies in preexisting, essential hypertension, but micropuncture studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) have shown that repetitive pregnancies in SHRs cause no functional impairment. Surprisingly, SHRs demonstrated no gestational renal vasodilation, although gestational decreases in peripheral resistance certainly occur in the SHR. This absence of gestational renal vasodilation may be a protective mechanism; it remains to be determined whether hypertensive states in which renal vasodilation does occur are associated with increased risk to the maternal kidney.\r"

In spite of inconsistent terminology and incomplete reporting, patterns were identified.

Surfactant dysfunction may contribute to this latter pulmonary pathophysiology. We sought to determine to what extent meconium itself might contribute to a functional surfactant deficiency. Specimens of newborn infants' first meconium were collected and pooled. Serial dilutions of the meconium were then added to various concentrations of calf lung surfactant extract, a mixture with the surface properties of natural surfactant that is used clinically to treat neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and the dynamic surface activity of these mixtures was studied with a pulsating bubble surfactometer. At surfactant concentrations of less than or equal to 1.5 mg/ml, even 6500-fold dilutions of meconium-inhibited surface tension lowering ability (10 +/- 2 mN/m vs 1 +/- 0.1 mN/m for controls, p less than 0.05). Moreover, this inhibitory activity resided in both the chloroform-soluble and the aqueous phases of meconium and appeared to be additive in nature. However, at sufficiently high concentrations of surfactant, even large amounts of meconium were unable to affect surface tension lowering properties. Thus meconium inhibits surfactant function in a manner that is dependent on the surfactant concentration, suggesting the possible utility of exogenous surfactant therapy in some cases of meconium aspiration.\r"

Iodide salt was administered to group A (n = 17), whereas group B (n = 18) was used as a control. Each group was tested for thyroid-stimulating hormone serum levels, iodine excretion, and thyroid volume. In both groups thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were similar and did not change throughout pregnancy. The iodine excretion at the third trimester in the treated group was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that of group B (100.0 +/- 39.0 versus 50.0 +/- 37.0 micrograms iodine per 24 hours, respectively). Initially, thyroid volume did not differ between the two groups. At the end of pregnancy, no difference was found in thyroid size in group A, whereas in the untreated women it increased significantly (p less than 0.0001) with a mean increase of 1.6 +/- 0.6 ml (16.2% +/- 6.0%). These results show that the increased thyroid size in the control group was mainly a result of relative iodine deficiency and that iodoprophylaxis should be warranted even in areas with moderate iodine deficiency to prevent the increase in thyroid size and, probably, to avoid the risk of maternal and fetal hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "A national sample of 1944 white menopausal women greater than or equal to 55 years old from the epidemiologic follow-up of participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was reviewed to investigate the role of hormone therapy in altering the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Women in the study were observed for up to 16 years after the baseline survey in 1971 to 1975. By 1987 631 women had died; 347 of these deaths were due to cardiovascular disease. History of diabetes (relative risk, 2.38; 95% confidence interval 1.73 to 3.26), previous myocardial infarction (relative risk, 2.12; 95% confidence interval 1.56 to 2.86), smoking (relative risk, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.69 to 2.81), and elevated blood pressure (relative risk, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 1.94) were strong predictors of cardiovascular disease-related death in this cohort. After adjusting for known cardiovascular disease risk factors (smoking, cholesterol, body mass index, blood pressure, previous myocardial infarction, history of diabetes, age) and education, the use of postmenopausal hormones was associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease (relative risk, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.90). The same protective effect provided by postmenopausal hormone therapy was seen in women who experienced natural menopause (relative risk, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.06).\r"

The number of possible ultrasonographic sections (\"slices\"), as well as the number of successful views in the axial, coronal, and sagittal sections, was tabulated. A detailed list of central nervous system structures that are seen at each gestational age is presented. The results showed that a significant number of brain structures could be imaged. The number and the clarity of the structures and the number of successful views in the three scanning planes increased with gestational age.

  ".W": "The principal objective of this study was to determine and compare the capability of human umbilical vessels of normal and pregnancy-induced hypertensive parturients to produce and to release the endothelial-derived relaxing factor. A bolus of bradykinin injected in the perfusion system of human umbilical vessels induces a release of a relaxant factor, detectable by bioassay, that is pharmacologically similar to the endothelial-derived relaxing factor. Human umbilical cords were collected from normal and pregnancy-induced hypertensive parturients. In the latter group the release of endothelial-derived relaxing factor is extremely reduced. In fact, in umbilical vessels collected from normal parturients, bradykinin at a dose of 20 pmol produces a release of endothelial-derived relaxing factor equivalent to a relaxation induced by 59.9 +/- 11.0 and 30.8 +/- 11.4 pmol of glyceryl trinitrate for the artery and vein, respectively. The same dose of bradykinin in umbilical vessels, collected from pregnancy-induced hypertensive parturients, produces a release equivalent to 6.6 +/- 2.2 and 5.7 +/- 3.5 pmol of glyceryl trinitrate equivalent for the artery and vein, respectively. Neither an increasing bolus of exogenous bradykinin or an infusion of superoxide dismutase or L-arginine was able to restore the production of endothelial-derived relaxing factor to normal levels. Our results indicate a probable alteration of endothelial cell numbers or an alteration of the enzymatic pathway, probably due to cytotoxic endogenous factors produced in pregnancy.\r"

To serve each of these functions, records should be systematic and detailed. This nationwide study was conducted to assess the extent to which prenatal records in current use include sufficient detail to serve these functions. A random sample of 2746 physicians who listed obstetrics and gynecology, obstetrics, or maternal-fetal medicine as a primary or secondary specialty in the American Medical Association file were contacted by mail and were requested to submit a blank copy of their prenatal records. The records of 969 respondents were examined for the presence or absence of 53 items that corresponded to the five functions identified above. The items of interest were present in 1% to 98% of the records. More than 90% included items of traditional medical-obstetric significance. The percentages of records with items of more contemporary relevance (e.g., cigarette smoking, risk-assessment checklists, psychological stress) were found in lower percentages of the records. Stratified and logistic regression analyses revealed that the most systematic and detailed records were commercially available, were used by physicians in hospital and government program-based practices, and were used by physicians who had completed medical school less than or equal to 15 years before the survey. The findings suggest that physicians who do not use commercially available forms or those who are in private or health maintenance organization practice or have been practicing for more than 15 years should reconsider their prenatal records in light of the functions they will serve in the 1990s and beyond.\r"

  ".W": "The role of reproductive factors in endometrial cancer risk has been analyzed in a case-control study conducted since 1983 in the greater Milan area on 568 women (cases) with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer and 1925 women (controls) who were admitted for acute, nonmalignant, hormonal, gynecologic conditions to hospitals that cover a comparable catchment area. Compared with nulliparous women, parous women had a 30% lower risk of endometrial cancer, but there was no evidence of a decline in risk with increasing number of births. The risk of the disease decreased with number of spontaneous or induced abortions; the multivariate relative risk estimates were, compared respectively with no spontaneous or induced abortions, 0.5 for women with two or more spontaneous abortions and 0.3 for women with two or more induced abortions; both trends in risk were statistically significant. When parous women only were considered, no association emerged between endometrial cancer and age at first birth, but the risk decreased with increasing age at last birth: compared with women whose last birth occurred before age 25, the relative risk was 0.5 for women who were greater than or equal to 35 years old at last birth, and the multivariate trend in risk was statistically significant. For most of the reproductive factors that were considered, the risk estimates tended to be greater at younger age or among premenopausal women and to flatten off in subsequent strata of age. An association between endometrial cancer and age at first birth was observed in women who were less than or equal to 49 years old, but not in older groups. The observation that later age at last birth as well as later first birth in younger women decreases the risk of endometrial cancer suggests a short-term protective effect of pregnancy. This finding is consistent with a late-stage (promotional) effect of reproductive factors on endometrial carcinogenesis.\r"

The flow velocity waveforms, being normal between uterine contractions, showed either an unchanged flow velocity waveform with an exclusive fetal heart rate effect on end-diastolic velocities or a rapid change to absent and reverse diastolic flow during the decelerations, indicating an abrupt increase in placental resistance with a halt in placental perfusion. Computer-aided reconstruction of the fetal heart rate curve revealed the exact temporal relationship between the reduction of umbilical artery perfusion and deceleration of fetal heart rate. We showed that variable decelerations of fetal heart rate can be observed during only slightly changed umbilical perfusion or can be caused by a halt in placental perfusion, which does not necessarily mean an absence of any movement of the fetal blood column, but is a result of a systolic forward and diastolic reverse flow to the same extent.\r"

Assessments of monthly fecundity with life table analysis techniques revealed a highly significant, positive relationship between fertility and hamster-oocyte fusion rates that were measured in the presence of the ionophore, A23187. Conversely, reactive oxygen species generation was shown to be negatively associated with both the outcome of the sperm-oocyte fusion assay and fertility in vivo. The clinical significance of these diagnostic techniques was emphasized by the fact that within the same data set, the conventional semen profile was of no significant diagnostic value.\r"

We have obtained tumor specimens from at least two separate sites during operations on 12 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, and we have typed these specimens with a group of 18 monoclonal antibodies that react with cell-surface glycoprotein and carbohydrate antigens, including blood group antigens. Antibodies with relative specificity for malignant cells as well as those that detect more widely distributed epithelial antigens were used. A total of 31 specimens from 12 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma (8 serous, 3 undifferentiated, 1 endometrioid) of the ovary were studied, including fresh ascites cells in two patients. Frozen sections of tumor specimens were stained with the antibodies by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique and graded semiquantitatively. Little difference was seen in antigenic expression of tumors that were obtained from various sites in the same patient for either the epithelial cell markers or blood group markers. Intratumoral antigenic heterogeneity was seen, but this was generally quite consistent within a given patient's specimens. As anticipated, variations in antigen expression were seen among specimens from different patients. The antigenic phenotype of the tumor specimens in a given patient, as determined immunohistochemically by our group of antibodies, showed only minor variation among primary and metastatic sites.\r"

Sixty-four obstetric patients with greater than or equal to 135 mg/dl on the 50 gm oral glucose screening test were scheduled for the 100 gm test. All patients repeated the oral glucose tolerance test in 1 to 2 weeks. Both tests included a preparatory diet, and testing conditions were identical. There were no significant differences in the mean test values at each testing interval when the entire study population was considered. Patients were then divided into four groups according to the outcome of the two tests. Forty-eight of 64 (75%) had normal results at each testing period (group 1); 11 of 64 (17%) had initially normal results and abnormal results on retest (group 2); 3 of 64 (5%) had initially abnormal results and normal results on retest (group 3); 2 of 64 (3%) had abnormal results at both testing phases (group 4). There were no significant differences between oral glucose tolerance test results within groups 1 and 4. However, significant differences occurred within groups 2 and 3 between the two tests. Group 2 patients had a greater frequency of an abnormal 1-hour value on the test than group 1 patients (p = 0.001). Overall, the reproducibility of the oral glucose tolerance test was 78% (50 of 64). We recommend the oral glucose tolerance test be repeated when the 1-hour value is abnormal or when the fasting blood sugar, 1-hour, and 2-hour values are near the upper end of the normal range.\r"

The antiviral drug acyclovir has been used effectively to suppress genital herpes simplex virus recurrences in nonpregnant adults. Its administration to pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes may reduce herpes simplex virus recurrences and thus may decrease the cesarean section rate among this population. To study the pharmacokinetics, safety, and patient tolerance of suppressive oral acyclovir, either 200 mg (n = 7) or 400 mg (n = 8) was administered orally every 8 hours to pregnant women with a history of recurrent herpes simplex virus, from 38 weeks' gestation until delivery. The mean +/- SD plasma levels for the 200 and 400 mg groups, respectively, were: first dose peak, 1.7 +/- 0.6 and 2.3 +/- 1.0 mumol/L; steady-state trough, 0.7 +/- 0.3 and 0.8 +/- 0.6 mumol/L; steady-state peak, 1.9 +/- 1.0 and 3.3 +/- 1.0 mumol/L. In late gestation maternal acyclovir pharmacokinetics were similar to those of nonpregnant adults from other studies. Acyclovir was concentrated in the amniotic fluid; however, there was no accumulation in the fetus (mean maternal/infant plasma ratio at delivery was 1.3). Acyclovir was well tolerated, and no toxicity was seen in the mothers or infants. The administration of acyclovir, 400 mg every 8 hours, appears appropriate for use in an efficacy and safety study regarding suppression of herpes simplex virus recurrences during the last weeks of pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 39 patients. An incision of the peritoneum between the round and infundibulo-pelvic ligament on each side gave access to the retroperitoneal space. Subsequently, laparoscopic surgery allowed precise dissection of external and internal iliac vessels, umbilical artery, and obturator nerve. The peritoneum was left open, and the lymph was drained into the peritoneal cavity. No lymphocele was observed. Three to 22 (mean, 8.7) nodes were removed, and there was no significant morbidity. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% in this preliminary experience. It is thus possible to remove the first-line regional lymph nodes of the cervix for pathologic examination. Because \"skip\" metastases are quite rare in early cervical carcinoma, the risk of missing a positive node is low. Brachytherapy alone, vaginal surgery, or, in microinvasive carcinoma, conization alone can be applied safely without the need of a staging laparotomy in cases with negative nodes.\r"

In this study of 18 women with antepartum pyelonephritis, although only a third had anemia (hematocrit less than 30 vol/dl), there was evidence for hemolysis in all 18. Specifically there was a mean decrease in hematocrit of 5 vol/dl from admission to discharge. With scanning electron microscopy, we compared erythrocyte morphologic aberrations that were found in women with renal infection with those of normally pregnant women, and the former had significantly increased proportions of echinocytes in particular, but schistocytes and spherocytes were increased also (total 10.3% vs 1.4%, p less than 0.0001). These changes, especially echinocytosis, have been induced in vitro by lipopolysaccharide, and they are known to lead to premature red blood cell destruction in vivo. We conclude that hemolysis with subsequent anemia in pregnant women with pyelonephritis is caused by lipopolysaccharide-induced red blood cell membrane damage.\r"

Cytologic smears of the uterine cervix of 111 human immunodeficiency virus-infected women were compared with findings in 76 female intravenous drug users negative for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and in a group of 526 women of the outpatient population of the hospital. Cervical dysplasia-neoplasia (including five cases of invasive carcinoma) was seen in 41% of the human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. In human immunodeficiency virus-negative intravenous drug users dysplasia-neoplasia was seen in 9%, and in the sample from outpatients in 4%, including two cases of invasive carcinoma (p less than 0.01). Cytologic features that were attributable to infection with human papillomavirus were observed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women four times more often than in the sample from the outpatient population (p less than 0.01). Frequency and severity of dysplasia appear to increase with diminishing numbers of CD4+ helper/inducer T lymphocytes and correlated significantly (p less than 0.01) with a loss of blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and tetanus toxoid. These results suggest an increased risk for the development of dysplasia of the uterine cervix in women with human immunodeficiency virus infection, which is related to the degree of immunosuppression.\r"

The most novel finding was the extremely high level of monoamine oxidase activity in the chorion compared with that in the amnion. The other enzyme of catecholamine metabolism, catechol-O-methyltransferase, did not show any difference in activity between the two layers. In addition, we observed that the enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, which is primarily located in the adrenal medulla, was also present in appreciable levels in the two layers of fetal membranes. These results suggest that fetal membranes, like the placenta, possess the enzymatic machinery to metabolize catecholamines and have the capacity to synthesize epinephrine.\r"

The leading causes of death were ectopic pregnancy complications, embolism, intrapartum cardiac arrest, and hypertension. Mortality ratios were determined by comparing the characteristics of the women whose death was pregnancy-related with those of women who had survived delivery of a live infant in New York City during the same period. Black and Hispanic women had mortality ratios that were respectively 4.2 and 2.0 times higher than those for white, non-Hispanic women. In comparison with women aged 20 to 24, those older than 30 were more than twice as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes, and those older than 40 were five times as likely to do so. Other factors that were associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-related mortality included 9 to 11 years of education, lack of private medical insurance, more than five previous pregnancies, and fewer than five prenatal visits. This study suggests that changes in current maternal-health and family-planning services will be required to achieve further reductions in preventable pregnancy-related mortality.\r"

Brewer Trophoblastic Disease Center of Northwestern University between 1969 (when use of combination chemotherapy for initial treatment of high-risk disease came into general use) and 1988 were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the relative importance of prognostic factors with respect to survival. The overall cure rate was 93% (363/391): 100% for 223 patients with nonmetastatic disease and 83% for 168 patients with metastatic disease. The only patients who died had a clinicopathologic diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma. In addition to presence of metastasis (83% vs 100%, p less than 0.0001) and diagnosis of choriocarcinoma (67% vs 100%, p less than 0.0001), number of metastases (47% if greater than 8 vs 92% if less than or equal to 8, p less than 0.0001), metastases to sites other than the lung or vagina (52% vs 91%, p = 0.0002), and previous failed chemotherapy (46% vs 84%, p = 0.0014) demonstrated independent significant effects on survival in patients with metastatic disease. A Brewer score, based on our multivariate analysis of survival in patients with metastatic disease, provided predictability of outcome (likelihood ratio chi 2 statistic, chi 2 = 49.8) comparable to that with the World Health Organization score (chi 2 = 45.3), both of which, in turn, were better predictors than either the traditional Hammond clinical classification system (chi 2 = 34.4) or the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (chi 2 = 22.9).\r"

The present study of 7000 infants was undertaken to reassess fetal growth in postterm pregnancies in which the expected date of confinement from last normal menstrual period dating was confirmed (+/- 7 days) by early ultrasonography. Results show a gradual shift toward higher birth weight and greater crown-heel length and head circumference between 273 and 300 days of gestational age.

  ".U": "91127563\r", 
  ".W": "Cocaine use among pregnant women and reports of its adverse perinatal consequences have increased substantially over the past 10 years. However, most researchers have studied patients registered at drug treatment centers or have relied on voluntary participation by patients, either of which introduces the possibility of selection bias. To determine the frequency and consequences of prenatal cocaine use among an unselected inner-city obstetric population, we collected urine samples from parturient women at a municipal hospital and anonymously tested these specimens for metabolites of cocaine, marijuana, opiates, and methadone. Urine specimens, with linked obstetric data sheets, were available from a study population of 1111 patients, and pediatric data sheets were available for 846 mother-infant pairs. Cocaine metabolites were found in 11.5% of the urine samples collected, whereas metabolites of marijuana, opiates, and methadone, respectively, were present in 1.1%, 1.2%, and 0.3% of the specimens. Cocaine users were more likely than nonusers to have had no prenatal care (51% vs 8.8%; p less than 0.0001), to be American-born rather than Caribbean-born (71% vs 33%; p less than 0.001), and to have a higher parity (1.83 vs 1.14; p less than 0.0001). Infants of cocaine users had a lower mean gestational age (-0.93 weeks; p less than 0.01), a lower mean birth weight (2560 +/- 788 vs 3151 +/- 699 gm; p less than 0.001), and an increased probability of having an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes (12.5% vs 3.2%; p less than 0.0001). Multiple linear regression analysis that isolated confounding variables such as the presence or absence of prenatal care, maternal age and parity, and the use of cigarettes and alcohol did not substantially affect the differences described above. The effect of cigarette smoking on reducing fetal size was cumulative. In conclusion, cocaine is the most commonly used illicit drug among parturients in this community and is strongly associated with underutilization of prenatal care services. Infants of cocaine users are more likely to be preterm and depressed at birth and to have a low birth weight. Cocaine use, through the above-noted effects, increases the need for prenatal care while simultaneously decreasing the likelihood that it will be obtained.\r"

Serum samples were obtained before each cycle of chemotherapy, before surgery, at least 4 weeks after surgery, and at 2- to 3-month intervals during follow-up from 78 of the patients with locally advanced cervical cancer who were receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen serum levels were elevated (greater than 2.5 ng/ml) in 71% of the patients with primary tumors and in 77% of the patients with recurrent carcinomas. The percentage of positivity increased significantly with stage (p = 0.03) and was higher in squamous cell tumors than in adenocarcinomas (p less than 0.001). Pretreatment squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels were not predictive of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response; however, the serial measurement during chemotherapy showed a good correlation with clinical response. In the patients who had surgery, squamous cell carcinoma antigen positivity did not correlate to pathologic findings (lymph node status, cervical and parametrial infiltration). Disease-free survival was significantly longer in patients with squamous cell carcinoma antigen pretreatment values that were lower than 5 ng/ml, compared with patients with marker higher than 5 ng/ml (p less than 0.01).

This article reviews what we know about cervical cancer in elderly women to provide clinicians with the background necessary for assessments of screening recommendations, integration of new data into practice, and development of consensus approaches to screening in the elderly. Two central questions that affect a screening program for the elderly are how long the neoplastic process takes from preinvasive disease to the development of invasive cancer, and how likely is it that a given neoplastic state observed in an elderly woman will, in fact, progress to a more severe state. The ultimate success of the new Medicare benefit will also be affected by the use of Papanicolaou testing, the technique of obtaining the smear, and the adequacy of reporting and follow-up. The expansion of Medicare benefits to include early cervical cancer detection has the potential to improve the quality and the duration of older women's lives.\r"

No renal abnormalities were detected in rats that received 1 mg/kg, and only focal or mild changes were found in rats that received 2 mg/kg of the liposomal preparation. Neurotoxicity, as determined by nerve conduction and inclined plane studies, developed in rats treated with free and liposomal cisplatin. These results are encouraging and warrant further investigation.\r"

In this study we analyzed the effect of human amniotic fluids at different gestational ages on the collagenase synthesis of cultured fibroblasts. Our results show that term amniotic fluids are capable of inducing the synthesis of collagenase and other proteases in fibroblasts, as revealed by selective increases in collagenase activity and in immunoreactive collagenase. Nonterm amniotic fluids failed to do the same. This phenomenon is proposed as a model for studying the collagen degradation of fetal membranes during term gestation.\r"

We used a monoclonal antibody specifically reactive with the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor to localize this receptor immunohistochemically in frozen sections of normal ovary and epithelial ovarian cancer. Normal ovarian epithelium was found to express epidermal growth factor receptor in all cases. Among 87 ovarian cancers, however, 23% did not express immunohistochemically detectable receptor. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression was not related to histologic grade or stage, but was associated with poor survival (p less than 0.05). The median length of survival of patients with tumors that did not express epidermal growth factor receptor was 40 months compared with 26 months in patients with tumors that did express epidermal growth factor receptor. As in breast and bladder cancer, expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in ovarian cancer appears to be a poor prognostic factor.\r"

Saline solution was used in a comparison treatment group. Half of the newborn rabbits received supplemental surfactant therapy after delivery via cesarean section on day 27, and all were ventilated on a ventilator-plethysmograph system for 30 minutes. The 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg regimens had no effect on birth weight or lung function. The 0.1 mg/kg regimen resulted in fetal growth retardation and improved ventilatory measurements, gas exchange, and decreased protein accumulation in the lung, without increasing surfactant pool size. The induction of lung maturation by corticosteroids has multiple targets in the developing lung and does not exhibit a linear dose response.\r"

Use of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine phospholipase C activity was determined in 204 isolates representative of those found in female genital tract. Multiple aerobic (28%) and anaerobic (28%) reproductive tract microorganisms showed phospholipase C activity. Phospholipase C-producing isolates included strains of Bacteroides fragilis, B. bivius, B. thetaiotaomicron, Gardnerella vaginalis, and group B streptococcus. Phospholipase C activity was heterogenous; not all isolates that belong to a particular species showed activity. Phospholipase C production may be a possible virulence factor produced by a number of microflora commonly implicated in various reproductive tract infections or conditions, as well as in some instances of preterm birth.\r"

In experiment 1, male rats were intravenously administered either 0.9% sodium chloride (group I) or 5.0% magnesium sulfate to elevate plasma magnesium levels to 5.8 +/- 0.1 (group II) or 10.5 +/- 1.0 mg/dl (group III). In experiment 2, pregnant rats were intravenously administered either 0.9% sodium chloride (normomagnesemia) or magnesium sulfate, resulting in a plasma magnesium concentration of 7.8 +/- 1.4 mg/dl. Thirty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of lidocaine (2.3 mg/kg per minute) was begun in both experiments. Biparietal electroencephalographic activity was monitored continuously. At the onset of electroencephalographic seizure activity, arterial plasma magnesium and lidocaine concentrations were measured. In groups I and III (experiment 1), brain parenchymal magnesium was also assayed. There were no differences in plasma lidocaine concentrations (in experiments 1 or 2) between saline solution and hypermagnesemic groups at onset of seizures. Brain magnesium level was unaltered by magnesium sulfate infusion. We conclude that acute administration of magnesium sulfate alters neither brain magnesium level nor the plasma lidocaine concentration associated with onset of electroencephalographic seizures.\r"

Between baseline and two weeks after surgery, all eyes became less myopic; between two weeks and three months, 161 eyes (59%) lost 1.00 D or more of the initial effect; and between three and six months, 266 eyes (95%) had a stable refraction with less than 1.00 D change. The change from six months to four years was less than 1.00 D for 246 eyes (72%). There was 1.00 D or more decrease in surgical effect (increased minus power) for 13 eyes (4%), and 1.00 D or more increase in surgical effect (decreased minus power) for 82 eyes (24%). Eyes with larger amounts of preoperative myopia and smaller diameter of the clear zone were more likely to have an increasing effect of the surgery. The duration of this continued increasing effect of the surgery is unknown.\r"

Both procedures resulted in significant corneal flattening, with the penetrating keratoplasty group producing an average of 3 diopters more keratometric reduction than the epikeratoplasty group one year postoperatively. Although no irreversible graft failures occurred, five of 16 eyes (31%) in the penetrating keratoplasty group had graft reactions.

Autofluorescence in the lens was measured at the center along the ocular axis by fluorophotometry. Lens autofluorescence in the eyes that underwent vitrectomy was significantly higher than in the contralateral eyes that were not operated on (P = .0003). The increase of autofluorescence was correlated significantly with the age at time of vitrectomy (P = .0008). There was no correlation between the increase in autofluorescence and the length of postoperative follow-up or the use of air during vitrectomy. Based on these results, we believe that oxidation of lens proteins intraoperatively may be one of the causes of development of nuclear cataract after vitrectomy.\r"

Apraclonidine hydrochloride was given either one hour preoperatively or immediately after uncomplicated, extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and compared with artificial tears given immediately postoperatively. Those who received apraclonidine hydrochloride preoperatively had significantly lower mean intraocular pressure at the first postoperative reading (P = .0005). After preoperative and postoperative apraclonidine hydrochloride, the mean early postoperative intraocular pressure was 19.8 mm Hg and 32.0 mm Hg, respectively, and 27.6 mm Hg after artificial tears. No patient who received preoperative apraclonidine hydrochloride had an intraocular pressure increase to 30 mm Hg or higher postoperatively. Nine of 20 patients (45%) who received postoperative apraclonidine hydrochloride and eight of 18 patients (44%) who received postoperative artificial tears had an increase of intraocular pressure to 30 mm Hg or higher in the early postoperative period. These differences were also highly significant (P = .0005).\r"

To assess the safety and efficacy of a recently developed 3-mm incision procedure with foldable intraocular lens implantation (phacotrabeculectomy), we compared 104 eyes subjected to this procedure with 112 eyes subjected to a 6-mm procedure at different follow-up periods. Intraocular pressure control (less than 21 mm Hg) was attained in 44 of 46 eyes (96%) in the 3-mm group and 71 of 76 eyes (93%) in the 6-mm group at one year postoperatively. Visual acuity of 20/40 or better was attained in 40 of 46 eyes (87%) in the 3-mm group and 66 of 76 eyes (87%) in the 6-mm group. The incidence of postoperative complication was significantly lower (P less than .001) and visual acuity in the early postoperative period was significantly better (P less than .01) in the 3-mm incision group than in the comparison group.\r"

The value of a pixel of a topographic image represented the height at this position. The mean height and the standard deviation over the five topographic images were calculated for each of the 65,536 pixel positions. The standard deviation of a single height measurement in normal eyes was 38.7 microns (range, 23.4 to 62.2 microns) for areas in the peripapillary retina and 42.6 microns (range, 24.4 to 53.7 microns) for measurements within the optic nerve head area. In glaucomatous eyes, the standard deviation was 41.2 microns (range, 23.2 to 59.6 microns) in the peripapillary retina and 49.4 microns (range, 28.1 to 72.8 microns) within the optic nerve head. There was no significant difference between the standard deviation of a single height measurement in normal and glaucomatous eyes (P = .34 within the optic nerve head area; P = .57 on peripapillary retina). No correlation was found between standard deviation of the measurements and pupil size or age of the subject.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that human plasma alpha 2 macroglobulin (alpha 2M) is a latent binding glycoprotein for human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Human recombinant 125I-TNF-alpha was incubated for 2 hours (37 degrees C) with purified native alpha 2M and with alpha 2M that was modified by reaction with methylamine or various proteinases. 125I-TNF-alpha/alpha 2M complexes were detected by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after autoradiography or by liquid chromatography on Superose-6. 125I-TNF-alpha bound strongly but noncovalently to alpha 2M-plasmin and alpha 2M-methylamine. There was minimal binding of 125I-TNF-alpha to native alpha 2M, alpha 2M-trypsin, or alpha 2M-thrombin. A 10(6) molar excess of porcine heparin did not reduce the binding of 125I-TNF-alpha to alpha 2M-methylamine or alpha 2M-plasmin. alpha 2M-plasmin or alpha 2M-methylamine added to human plasma or serum preferentially bound 125I-TNF-alpha in the presence of native alpha 2M. 125I-TNF-alpha also bound to 'fast' alpha-macroglobulins in methylamine-reacted human, rat, mouse, swine, equine, and bovine plasma. However, TNF-alpha, preincubated with either alpha 2M-plasmin or alpha 2M-methylamine, remained a potent necrogen for cultured L929 cells. Purified 125I-TNF-alpha/alpha 2M-plasmin complex injected intravenously in CD-1 mice rapidly cleared from the circulation, unless the alpha 2M-receptor pathway was blocked by coinjection of excess alpha 2M-trypsin. These findings demonstrate that alpha 2M is a latent plasmin-activated binding glycoprotein for TNF-alpha and that TNF-alpha/alpha 2M-plasmin complexes can be removed from the circulation by the alpha 2M-receptor pathway. This suggests that alpha 2M may be an important regulator of the activity and distribution of TNF-alpha in vivo.\r"

This process is called splicing and usually is studied by in vitro transcription experiments and by Northern blotting. The pre-mRNA of the first calcitonin gene (CALC-I) can be spliced alternatively into two different mRNAs encoding either for calcitonin or for calcitonin gene-related peptide (alpha-CGRP). The expression of CALC-I was studied by in situ hybridization in the nervous system of the rat with calcitonin-specific and CGRP-specific probes. We found evidence for alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA of CALC-I in the motor neurons of the spinal cord. alpha-CGRP mRNA was found in the nuclei and the cytoplasm of the spinal motor neurons, whereas hybridization with a calcitonin-specific probe was located strictly in the nuclei. Because no calcitonin RNA and protein was detected in the cytoplasm of the cells, we concluded that the hybridization obtained in the nucleus was the pre-mRNA encoding for alpha-CGRP.\r"

The procedure described here was used to detect loss of heterozygosity at various loci, including the Hbb beta-globin gene cluster, in chemically induced mouse skin tumors, using a variety of tissue preparations, including microdissection of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, short-term cultures, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting of epithelial populations.

In this study, anti-streptococcal monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) cross-reactive with myocardium were reacted with sections from 22 rheumatic valves, nine normal, five endocarditic, one 'floppy,' and one Marfan valve. In immunohistochemical studies, MAb reactivity was observed with cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle cells, cell surface and cytoplasm of endothelial cells lining valves, and valvular interstitial cells. Endothelial basement membrane and elastin fibrils reacted with the MAbs, whereas collagen was unreactive. Similar reactivity was seen with sera from acute rheumatic fever patients. The anti-streptococcal MAbs reacted with intravalvular myosin and vimentin in Western blots, and purified elastin competitively inhibited the binding of the anti-streptococcal MAbs to whole group A streptococci. The data show that human heart valves have numerous sites of immunoreactivity with anti-streptococcal MAbs and acute rheumatic fever sera of potential importance in the pathogenesis of rheumatic valvular injury.\r"

Edema, extravasation of polymorphs, and lymphocytes associated with focal parenchymal injury were early, invariable, and probably nonspecific findings. The initial feature of unmodified rejection was the appearance of capillary and small vein endothelial changes with mainly perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. Acinar cell loss occurred early and was progressive, whereas islets and ducts were relatively preserved, indicating that acinar tissue may be more vulnerable to lytic necrosis when damaged. Functional rejection, determined by fasting urinary amylase levels, was at a stage of extensive and irreversible necrosis. Functioning grafts in immunosuppressed dogs had minor and transient endothelial changes with absence of class II antigen staining of parenchymal cells.\r"

  ".W": "Complement has been reported to mediate mesangiolysis and glomerular hypercellularity in the rat in a model of glomerulonephritis (GN) induced with anti-Thy 1 antibody. To investigate the mechanism for the complement-mediated hypercellularity, the authors first determined if the effect of complement depletion was to inhibit cell proliferation or whether the effect was primarily to inhibit leukocyte infiltration. Rats depleted of complement with cobra venom factor (CVF) had 1) significantly less mesangiolysis than controls at day 5 (0.6 +/- 0.1 versus 3.4 +/- 0.4, scale 0-4+, P less than 0.001); 2) less cell proliferation, as assessed by immunostaining for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)/cyclin, a cell-cycle-dependent antigen (0.5 +/- 0.1 versus 2.4 +/- 0.7 cells/glomerular cross-section, P less than 0.01); and 3) less leukocyte infiltration as assessed by immunohistochemical labeling (0.6 +/- 0.1 versus 1.9 +/- 0.3 cells/glomerular cross-section, P less than 0.01). Because it was reported recently that platelets also mediate glomerular cell proliferation in this model, this study examined whether the mechanism for complement-mediated cell proliferation involved an effect on glomerular platelet localization. The glomerular uptake of 111In-labeled platelets was quantitated in normal and CVF-treated rats at 1, 4, 12, and 24 hours after induction of GN. Rats with anti-Thy 1 GN had substantial glomerular accumulation of platelets at all times studied, peaking at 4 hours (608 +/- 171 platelets per glomerulus). Complement depletion profoundly reduced glomerular platelet localization in anti-Thy 1 GN (mean less than 35 platelets per glomerulus at all times studied, P less than 0.05). Thus these studies demonstrate an important role for complement in mediating platelet localization in anti-Thy 1 GN, an effect that may account for the complement-dependent, neutrophil-independent glomerular hypercellularity in this model.\r"

Nuclei of acinar cells from normal pancreas, adenomas, and three carcinomas in situ had normal diploid DNA content as determined by flow cytometry. One of two primary carcinomas had a hypodiploid DNA content. Two of three transplantable carcinomas were aneuploid with a DNA content in the tetraploid range. Explants from nodules and adenomas failed to grow in soft agar, whereas several carcinomas were positive in this assay. A primary carcinoma was serially transplanted, but transplantation of nodules or adenomas failed. Transfection of DNA from carcinomas in situ yielded a higher frequency of NIH 3T3 transformants than DNA from adenomas. DNAs from the transformants did not contain ras sequences. These studies indicate that cells from nodules and adenomas have low growth potential and lack critical phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of transformed malignant cells that were present in some primary and transplanted carcinomas.\r"

This paper presents the ultrastructural features of respiratory cilia in these rats in comparison with those in human immotile cilia syndrome. The respiratory cilia in these rats also are immotile and the dynein arms are missing, as in human cases. Previously only eight dogs with immotile cilia syndrome and a mutant hydrocephalic-polydactyl mouse were reported with respect to these phenomena. However the WIC-Hyd rat is the first useful animal model for human immotile cilia syndrome, and further studies may serve to clarify the genetic background of this condition.\r"

In this communication, the authors attempted to correlate morphologic heterogeneity of melanomas with transformation by different activated oncogenes; they studied the histologic features of melanocytic lesions induced by murine melanocytes transformed by basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF-cDNA) or H-ras, neu, myc, and E1a oncogenes, and the lesions were compared with those observed in human pathology. Tumors formed after grafting onto syngenic mice or subcutaneous injections in nude mice were studied. In syngenic mice, benign melanocytic lesions reminiscent of intradermal nevus were observed with melanocytes transformed with b-FGF-cDNA, and myc and E1a oncogenes. Benign lesions were also formed by neu-transformed melanocytes when they were grafted concomitantly with keratinocytes, whereas malignant tumors were formed by the same cells when grafted alone or together with fibroblasts. In contrast, H-ras melanocytes always formed malignant tumors. In nude mice, b-FGF-transformed melanocytes induced benign lesions, whereas transformed melanocytes by the other oncogenes formed malignant tumors with distinctive and homogeneous morphologic features that depended on the transforming oncogene. Melanomas with either epithelioid cell, spindle cell, small round cell, and anaplastic cell growth patterns could be distinguished after transformation with H-ras, neu, E1a, and myc oncogenes, respectively. These various histologic types are analogous to those that may be observed in human melanomas, even within the same tumor. These studies suggest a possible molecular mechanism for tumor heterogeneity in which distinct oncogenes or oncogenelike activities can be activated in different tumors or discrete parts of the same tumor.\r"

Within the liver lobule, immunohistochemically demonstrable adduct occurred in a temporally progressive, central-to-peripheral pattern. There was concordance between immunohistochemical staining and quantification of the adduct in hepatic 10,000g supernate, using a quantitative particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay. Findings include: 1) immunochemically detectable adduct before the appearance of centrilobular necrosis, 2) distinctive lobular zones of adduct localization with subsequent depletion during the progression of toxicity, 3) drug-protein binding in hepatocytes at subhepatotoxic doses and before depletion of total hepatic glutathione, 4) immunohistochemical evidence of drug binding in the nucleus, and 5) adduct in metabolically active and dividing hepatocytes and in macrophagelike cells in the regenerating liver.\r"

Using immunoperoxidase techniques, little or no INCAM-110 was detected on endothelium in normal human tissues. In contrast, INCAM-110 was expressed in postcapillary venules in a variety of active inflammatory processes. In acute appendicitis, INCAM-110 was found coincident with strong expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1), a cytokine-inducible molecule that functions in neutrophil adhesion. However, in certain chronic inflammatory processes (eg, sarcoidosis), INCAM-110 was observed without simultaneous ELAM-1 expression. Anti-INCAM-110 antibody E1/6 also marked several extravascular cell types, including lymphoid dendritic cells, some tissue macrophages, synovial lining cells, and reactive mesothelial cells. These data suggest a role for endothelial INCAM-110 in the pathophysiology of both acute and chronic inflammatory reactions. Furthermore INCAM-110 may function as an adhesion molecule for mononuclear leukocytes in a variety of extravascular sites.\r"

  ".W": "Using a model of sepsis induced by parenteral challenge of mice with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the authors analyzed the in vivo expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha,beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both TNF and IL-1 alpha,beta were detected in hepatic sinusoidal macrophages (Kupffer cells), immunohistochemically. Kinetic analysis showed a clear sequence of synthesis. Tumor necrosis factor was produced first, reaching maximal expression at 1 hour after LPS challenge, then rapidly disappeared. IL-1 beta followed, reaching maximal expression at 2 to 3 hours, then dropped off by 6 hours. Interleukin-1 alpha expression reached a peak at 6 hours and had disappeared by 18 hours. Analysis of serum bioactivity also revealed sequential expression that correlated with immunohistochemical findings. Tumor necrosis factor was maximal at 1 hour and IL-1 at 6 hours. The IL-1 bioactivity was not due to interleukin-6 (IL-6), as this was depleted from specimens by immunoabsorption. Also IL-6 bioactivity reached maximal levels at 3 hours, earlier than IL-1. Pretreatment with 4 mg/kg dexamethasone significantly decreased Kupffer cell expression of TNF and IL-1 alpha (about 80% and 60% suppression, respectively) but had less effect on IL-1 beta expression (about 30% suppression). Accordingly, serum levels of TNF were suppressed by 75% while serum IL-1 was decreased by 39%, indicating differential sensitivity of these cytokines to glucocorticoids. Endogenous corticosteroid levels increased as TNF levels decreased, supporting the contention that glucocorticoids regulate TNF synthesis. In contrast, IL-1 levels rose concurrently with corticosterone. These data indicate a sequential activation of cytokine gene expression in vivo, which may be critical to the cascade of events leading to septic shock, and provide evidence that Kupffer cells are a major source of cytokines in endotoxemia. Finally, the differential sensitivity of cytokine expression to glucocorticoids may in part explain the inadequacy of the latter in the treatment of sepsis.\r"

In these transgenic mice, amyloid deposition started in the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and kidneys 6 months after birth and extended to various other organs and tissues with advancing age. At age 24 months, the pattern of amyloid deposition was similar to that observed in human autopsy cases of FAP, except for its absence in the choroid plexus and in the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. Amyloid deposition was shown to be composed of human mutant TTR and, in addition, mouse serum amyloid P component. These results clearly indicate that human variant TTR produced in transgenic mice deposits is a major component of amyloid fibrils in various organs and tissues. Thus this animal model is useful for analyzing how amyloid deposition initiates and proceeds in FAP.\r"

Kidney tissues from 13 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were studied by immunohistochemical techniques for the distribution of three recently described collagen peptides (M28+, M28 [Good-pasture antigen], and Alport antigen) and various components of classical type IV collagen [alpha 1(IV) noncollagenous (NC) globular domain, alpha 2(IV) NC, 7S, triple helix]. Recently M28 and M28+ were designated as NC monomers of alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV) based on limited amino acid sequencing. During the course of the disease, the distribution of the M28 chains and the Alport peptide segregated completely from that of classical type IV collagen. In diabetic kidneys, antibodies to the M28 and Alport peptides reacted intensely with the thickened GBM but not with the mesangium. In contrast, the reactivity of antibodies to various components of classical type IV collagen was prominent within the expanded mesangial matrix with significant decrease in reactivity in the peripheral capillary wall. In hyalinized glomeruli, components of classical type IV collagen virtually disappeared, whereas the M28 and Alport peptides persisted in the collapsed GBM. These studies support the view that expansion of the mesangial matrix and thickening of the GBM involve separate and distinct collagen components. The differential expression of the M28 and Alport peptides compared with that of classical type IV collagen may be a consequence of differing sites of synthesis (classical type IV collagen from endothelial/mesangial cells and M28 and Alport chains from visceral epithelial cells), independent control mechanisms, and/or differences in degradation.\r"

In situ hybridization with an HIV envelope-specific RNA probe demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in these multinucleated giant cells.

Neural cell adhesion molecules, tenascin, and fibronectin are induced in the granulation tissue but the order of prevalence is fibronectin, tenascin, N-CAM. The order of appearance is N-CAM and fibronectin, and then tenascin. The order of disappearance is N-CAM, tenascin, fibronectin. Liver cell adhesion molecules are present in the epidermis undergoing re-epithelization. Explant cultures showed that N-CAM and tenascin are synthesized by wound fibroblasts.

Neither autoradiograph exposure time, within specific time limits, nor dose of tritiated thymidine are major variables. Differences in absolute values obtained by autoradiography of enzyme-dispersed cells versus cells in cross-section, however, are reproducible. A comparison of frequency data from animals injected with tritiated thymidine during a 24-hour period compared with data from animals infused continuously for 1 week suggests that continuous infusion allows accumulation of labeled cells over time at a rate that is predictable from data of animals injected during 24 hours. In the current study it was found that although the frequency of tritiated thymidine-labeled thoracic aorta smooth muscle cells may vary according to the technique used in preparing the tissue, the daily rate of replication in a 4-month-old rat is estimated to be approximately 0.047% per day.\r"

This is the first report clearly showing a direct toxicity of TNF on endothelial cells and demonstrating that this results from the induction of the program of apoptotic death.

  ".W": "To investigate whether early changes in the transformation of normal ovarian epithelial cells into tumor cells can be detected with monoclonal antibodies, a comparative immunohistochemical study was performed on normal human ovarian mesothelial cells, cystomas, cystadenomas, ovarian carcinomas, as well as granulosa cell tumor. Using monoclonal antibodies against different keratin subtypes, it was shown that mesothelial cells, ovarian cysts, cystadenomas, and carcinomas all reacted positively with broad-spectrum anti-keratin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as well as with MAbs to keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19. Keratins 4 and 13 were not found in mesothelial cells, but positive groups of cells were identified in several cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas. While mesothelial cells did not react with the pan-epithelial marker BW495/36, invaginating metaplastic mesothelial cells, inclusion cysts, cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas showed an increasing reactivity with BW495/36, with an increasing degree of malignancy. The reactivity of MAbs against ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (OV-TL 3, OC 125, MOv 18, and OV-TL 10) was limited to weak staining reaction in some mesothelial cells but were found to be positive on more than 50% of the ovarian cystadenomas and more than 90% of the ovarian carcinomas. Thecal and granulosa cells of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles all reacted positively with antibodies to the broad-spectrum keratins OV-TL 12/5 and RCK 102, and to keratins 8 and 18, but not with keratins 4, 7, 13, and 19. These keratins decreased or disappeared in granulosa cells of mature follicles (Graafian follicles), whereas granulosa cell tumors did not react with anti-keratin antibodies. The reactivity of BW 495/36 was negative or limited to traces in some granulosa cells. Ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens were not expressed in granulosa cells or granulosa cell tumors. The data indicate that mesothelial cells undergoing metaplastic changes finally resulting in ovarian cystadenomas (and carcinomas) initiate the synthesis of a 200-kd glycoprotein recognized by MAb (BW 495/36), the production of ovarian carcinoma associated antigens, in addition to focal production of keratin 4 and/or 13, as seen in several samples. The granulosa cell tumors decrease or switch off their keratin production and remain negative for the 200-kd glycoprotein and the ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens.\r"

The extensive tissue injury that developed included subepithelial electron-dense deposits, podocyte foot process effacement, and expansion of the glomerular basement membrane. Levels of mRNA for type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin from isolated glomeruli was quantitated by slot-blot analysis and showed no change in experimental animals as compared to controls at either 1 week, 3 weeks, or 3 months after disease induction. Immunoelectron microscopy with gold-labeled anti-laminin IgG revealed no difference in the number of particles bound to the glomerular basement membrane of experimental animals and controls. Immunofluorescence with both type IV collagen antisera and anti-laminin antibody showed no difference in the intensity or pattern of staining. Despite extensive glomerular damage and glomerular basement membrane thickening, no evidence was found for either an increase in the synthetic rate of type IV collagen, laminin, or fibronectin or for an accumulation of basement membrane laminin within the damaged glomeruli. Alternate processes, such as diminished density of matrix components or accumulation of other unmeasured matrix constituents, presumably account for the expansion of the glomerular basement membrane seen in experimental membranous nephropathy.\r"

In this study, inflammatory cell populations and adhesion molecule expression in early phases of DHR elicited by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene were evaluated. The first discernible event (at 1 hour) was mast cell degranulation, followed by induction of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM-1) expression on dermal postcapillary venules at 2 hours. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule expression peaked at 24 hours and declined by 48 hours. In contrast, endothelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) remained at constitutive levels. Intrafollicular T-cell migration occurred independent of ICAM-1 expression and commenced as early as 4 hours after challenge. Mature, activated CD4-positive lymphocytes that expressed a helper-inducer/memory phenotype predominated in early lesions. These results demonstrate in vivo that mast cell degranulation, ELAM-1 expression, and memory T-cell-follicular interactions are key events in subclinical evolutionary stages of cutaneous DHR.\r"

  ".W": "Alveolar macrophages (AM) and their production of interleukin-1-like activity (IL-1) and macrophage-derived growth factor for fibroblasts (MDGF) were examined during chronic inflammatory reactions leading to either granuloma formation or fibrosis. Groups of five rats each received, respectively, a single transtracheal injection of xonotlite, attapulgite, short chrysotile 4T30, UICC chrysotile B asbestos, or saline. One month later, such treatments induced either no change (xonotlite), granuloma formation (attapulgite and short chrysotile 4T30), or fibrosis (UICC chrysotile B). By 8 months, however, the granulomatous reactions had resolved or greatly diminished, whereas the fibrosis persisted irreversibly. Parallel examination of cell populations obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage revealed that multinucleated giant macrophages (MGC) were present in lavage fluids of animals with resolving granulomatous reactions but absent in those obtained from animals with lung fibrosis. Evaluation of monokine production by inflammatory macrophages also revealed significant differences. Enhanced production of IL-1-like activity was seen in both types of lung injury, although especially during the early stage (1 month) and decreased thereafter (8 months). By contrast, augmentation of MDGF production was observed in animals with lung fibrosis only and persisted up to 9 months. Taken together, these data indicate that production of selected cytokines, as well as AM differentiation along a given pathway, may modulate the outcome of a chronic inflammatory response.\r"

A method for the detection of coxsackievirus B3 RNA was developed using the polymerase chain reaction based on the amplification of a cDNA copy of the positive-strand viral RNA. The fidelity of the method was established in two murine models for coxsackie B3 myocarditis. All cardiac specimens with adequate RNA for study from coxsackie B3-infected mice contained detectable viral RNA, in contrast to none of control specimens from noninfected mice. The sensitivity of the technique was established at approximately 1 to 100 plaque-forming units of virus per gram of tissue, and the specificity was established as limited to the coxsackievirus B3 serotype among nine viruses tested. In patients with myocarditis, one of five specimens contained detectable viral RNA, whereas none of 11 specimens from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or 21 myocardial specimens from patients with a wide variety of other cardiac disorders contained detectable coxsackie B3 viral RNA. The results show that the polymerase chain reaction is a useful means for detecting coxsackie viral RNA and its application should help in the evaluation of hypotheses concerning the infectious etiology of human myocarditis and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

In addition to keratins 8 and 18, the glandular component of synovial sarcoma showed prominent reactivity with antibodies to keratins 7 and 19. Also the glandular epithelial cells in synovial sarcoma showed desmoplakin immunoreactivity preferentially in a luminal distribution, but desmoplakin was absent in other spindle cell sarcomas. Furthermore keratin 13 was seen focally in 4 of 9 synovial sarcomas. In contrast, keratins 7, 13, and 19 were practically absent in leiomyosarcomas, malignant schwannomas, and undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas. The widespread presence of keratins 8 and 18 in various spindle cell sarcomas may reflect aberrant keratin expression in mesenchymal cells, previously described in cultured transformed fibroblasts. The presence of keratins 7 and 19 and desmoplakin is highly associated with morphologically observable epithelial differentiation restricted to synovial sarcoma among spindle cell sarcomas.\r"

The most important source of information for the review is human research reports published in refereed journals. A few animal studies, book chapters, and abstracts that are especially relevant are also included. RESULTS: In humans, ethanol in small doses produces cerebral vasodilation; higher doses induce cerebral vasoconstriction. Chronic alcoholism is associated with reduced CBF and cerebral metabolism. Sedatives and antianxiety drugs lead to global reduction in CBF and cerebral metabolism. Caffeine, even in small doses, is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor. Cerebral vasodilation is seen immediately after cigarette smoking, but chronic smokers show global reduction in CBF. Changes in CBF after marijuana smoking are variable; both increases and decreases are seen. Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF. Most inhalants and solvents are vasodilators; chronic abuse is accompanied by a decrease in CBF. A number of drugs of abuse, including ethanol, amphetamines, cocaine, nicotine, and caffeine-phenylpropanolamine combinations, increase the risk for stroke. Reduction in CBF associated with chronic use of ethanol, nicotine, inhalants, and solvents is at least partially reversible upon abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Topics for future research include regional brain function, which mediates drug-induced mood changes (euphoria); CBF concomitants of psychological and physiological characteristics that increase addiction potential; changes in CBF that accompany withdrawal syndromes; mechanisms responsible for drug-induced stroke; and effects of functional and organic complications on CBF.\r"

DATA COLLECTION: They review data suggesting the involvement of serotonergic, dopaminergic, and opiate neurotransmitter systems in the expression of self-injurious behavior. FINDINGS: Self-injurious behavior occurs among mentally retarded individuals, psychotic patients, prison populations, and individuals with severe character disorders. Although theoretical psychological models of self-injurious behavior are helpful in understanding the patient's experience of self-injury, no generally useful therapeutic approach has yet evolved from these models. Data derived from animal models and treatment studies suggest the involvement of opiatergic and dopaminergic mechanisms in self-injury among the mentally retarded. Serotonergic influences on self-injurious behavior may be present in varying forms of this behavior. The scientific literature on the benefits of pharmacological agents for mentally retarded individuals is beset with a number of problems. Support is emerging, however, for the use of lithium and carbamazepine with self-injuring mentally retarded patients, and some behavioral interventions appear to be successful for mentally retarded individuals. Self-injuring patients with borderline personality disorder may benefit from milieu treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although no form of treatment has yet been demonstrated to be of general benefit, the literature suggests that therapeutic trials with dopamine antagonists, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and opiate antagonists may be of value.\r"

Little has been written, however, on the clinical impact of the review process itself. The actions of insurance reviewers often result in their being incorporated into the psychopathology of individual patients and into the dynamics of families and institutional settings. The authors apply psychodynamic understanding to a series of case examples to illustrate how concurrent review may promote splitting, impede the patient's ability to separate from the hospital, and paradoxically reinforce the patient's illness. They also explore a number of typical responses of treatment staff and families to the review process. A case vignette demonstrating a sincere effort at mutual collaboration between payers and providers is also presented. This spirit of compromise is proposed as the solution that best serves patient care.\r"

The results of prior studies that have reported an association between psychological and psychiatric comorbidity and longer hospital stays have been subject to different interpretations because of methodological design flaws. The current paper reports on a study of psychological comorbidity and length of stay that has been designed to avoid the methodological problems of earlier investigations. METHOD: The study was performed at a 429-bed tertiary-care, university-affiliated, voluntary, teaching hospital. During hospital days 3 to 5, patients were tested as available with the Mini-Mental State examination, the Zung Depression Inventory, and the SCL-90 and were rated for physical impairment with the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. Statistical analyses were performed for correlations between length of stay and test scores, rating scales, and demographic and discharge data from the chart. RESULTS: Of 424 patients approached, 321 (76%) agreed to participate and 278 (65.6%) completed the test battery. Depression, anxiety, and organicity, measured by psychological tests, were significantly correlated with longer hospital stay. These correlations remained significant after the authors controlled for degree of physical impairment, emergency versus elective admission, and medical versus surgical service, which were themselves correlated with longer hospital stay. DISCUSSION: This study confirms a significant correlation between psychological comorbidity and length of stay after correcting for the methodological pitfalls found in earlier studies. The clinical, research, economic, and policy implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

METHOD: Seventy-five patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were treated in a rural mental health center were assessed with research interviews and ratings by their clinical case managers. The patients were followed for 1 year to identify episodes of psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration, and literal homelessness. RESULTS: Of the 75 patients, 19 (25%) had housing situations characterized as unstable by their case managers. For the majority, housing instability signified tenuousness of living arrangements rather than literal homelessness. Noncompliance with medications, alcohol use, and negative symptoms accounted for 30% of the variance in unstable housing. During follow-up, the unstably housed patients, compared to those in stable living situations, were no more likely to be rehospitalized but were somewhat more likely to be jailed and significantly more likely to be literally homeless. CONCLUSIONS: In the authors' previous study of urban psychiatric patients, unstably housed patients were more likely to be literally homeless, highly symptomatic, and rehospitalized during follow-up than the rural patients with unstable housing. Better outcomes in the rural area appeared to be related to the greater availability of housing alternatives and to intensive case management. For patients with unstable housing in both settings, noncompliance with medications and substance abuse, as well as housing arrangements, should be assertively addressed.\r"

METHOD: They examined 23 depressed patients and 23 matched comparison subjects with this assay. There were no significant differences between these groups. They then combined the results of this study with the results of their previous study of 20 depressed patients and 20 comparison subjects to examine possible determinants of lymphocyte proliferation in depression. RESULTS: Depressed patients with lower proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects had lower depression subscale, anergia subscale, and total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale than did patients with higher proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects. This finding was unexpected and unexplained. Depressed patients with lower proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects also had fewer obsessions and compulsions and less psychomotor agitation according to the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia interview than did patients with higher proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects. Stepwise discriminant analysis and cluster analysis contributed little further understanding of the determinants of in vitro lymphocyte proliferation of cells from depressed patients. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal studies using multiple serial determinations of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation are the minimal design needed to make this assay useful in further evaluating any immune system changes in depression.\r"

The authors' objective is to address the following questions: 1) What is the effect of comorbid illness on the severity of major depression and associated psychosocial factors? 2) How does the course of depression differ for patients with and without concurrent illness? 3) Do patients with compound depression differ in rate of recovery and time to recovery from patients with pure depression? METHOD: The subjects were 78 patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of major depression who were consecutively admitted to an acute care university-affiliated psychiatric hospital; 37 of these patients had major depression only and 41 had major depression compounded by a coexisting axis I, II, or III condition. The patients were studied while hospitalized and for 12 months after hospital discharge. Instruments used included the Modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Global Assessment Scale, and the Social Readjustment Rating Scale. RESULTS: Patients with compound depression reported significantly poorer functioning over the 12-month follow-up period and had lower recovery rates than the patients with pure depression. There were no differences in recovery rates between men and women with compound depression, but significantly more men than women with pure depression recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Compound depression is a common clinical occurrence, the course of illness is more difficult for patients with compound depression than for patients with pure depression, and the recovery rate of patients with compound depression is lower than that of patients with pure depression.\r"

METHOD: Fifty-two inpatients and outpatients who had had single, unilateral strokes were included. Patients with past CNS or psychiatric disorders were excluded. A modified Visual Analogue Dysphoria Scale was used to allow the inclusion of all but the most impaired aphasic patients. Sleep and eating disturbances were measured by using both self-report and nursing assessments. Location of lesions was determined by CT scan and classified according to three dimensions: right-left, dorsal-ventral, and frontal-nonfrontal. RESULTS: On measures of dysphoric mood and sleep disturbance, results indicated significant three-way interactions among the three lesion dimensions. No differences were found with regard to eating disturbance. Greater dysphoria and sleep disturbance were found in subjects with left parietal/occipital, left inferior frontal, right superior frontal, and right temporal lesions than in subjects with lesions in other locations. Depressive symptoms were not associated with functional impairment as measured by activities of daily living, motor strength, or severity of aphasia. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that lesion location is a valid and significant factor in the mixture of influences which may result in a dysphoric mood state following stroke. The relation between the site of the lesion and subsequent depressive symptoms, however, may be more complex than has been reported previously.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the specific nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies had noted impaired odor identification, but there was no unanimity about the presence of odor detection deficits. METHOD: Odor identification was tested in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 57 elderly control subjects by using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Odor detection was assessed in 46 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and 40 control subjects by using a forced-choice threshold test with geraniol as the odorant. RESULTS: Significant deficits in olfactory identification were present in subjects who were in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment, and these deficits increased as Alzheimer's disease progressed. There was some overlap in individual smell identification test scores between cognitively impaired patients and normal elderly subjects. On the other hand, odor detection deficits did not appear until Alzheimer's disease was relatively advanced. Smell identification test scores were correlated with Mini-Mental State scores, but geraniol detection was not. CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease and may be more influenced by cognitive status than is acuity of odor detection, which is not altered until later in the disorder. The pattern of hyposmia in Alzheimer's disease suggests that the disorder may not \"begin in the nose,\" as has been theorized previously. Further refinement of olfactory testing may be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of early dementia.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Nonfearful panic disorder meets the DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder but is not associated with subjective fear and anxiety. The authors determined its prevalence in a group of neurology patients and assessed its diagnostic validity as a panic disorder subtype by evaluating the response of the patients with nonfearful panic disorder to sodium lactate and antipanic pharmacotherapy. METHOD: The subjects were all neurology patients referred over 1 year to a university hospital's psychiatric consultation service because of negative medical workups for their symptoms (N = 48). Patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder but did not report subjective anxiety or fear during panic episodes were diagnosed as having nonfearful panic disorder. Afterward, each of those patients received a sodium lactate infusion and, 5 hours later, a sodium chloride infusion. They were then treated with antipanic medication and followed for at least 6 months. RESULTS: Of the 48 neurology patients referred for psychiatric evaluation, 11 (23%) met the criteria for panic disorder, and all 11 met the criteria for nonfearful panic disorder. All 11 responded positively to lactate but not to placebo, and they each experienced an at least 75% reduction in symptoms during the 6-month follow-up period. Detailed case reports of three of these patients are presented. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the construct and predictive diagnostic validity of nonfearful panic disorder as a subtype of panic disorder and suggest that a lack of attention to this group leads to both the underestimation of the prevalence of panic disorder and to the withholding of potentially successful treatments for this group.\r"

  ".U": "91127749\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This study was constructed to detail the demographic and phenomenological features of chronic hair pullers as well as to assess psychiatric comorbidity in a sizable study group. METHOD: Subjects were drawn from an outpatient population of chronic hair pullers who had been referred to a trichotillomania clinic or had responded to a newspaper advertisement announcing a treatment study of adults who pull out their hair. Sixty adult chronic hair pullers completed a semistructured interview that focused on their hair-pulling behavior and demographic characteristics and that incorporated screening questions for DSM-III-R axis I disorders. The data were tabulated to derive a comprehensive picture of this group. RESULTS: The typical subject was a 34-year-old woman who had pulled hair from two or more sites for 21 years. All subjects described either tension before or relief/gratification after pulling hair from the primary site, but 17% (N = 10) failed to describe both of these characteristics and thus failed to fulfill the DMS-III-R criteria for trichotillomania. Forty-nine subjects (82%) qualified for past or current axis I diagnoses other than trichotillomania. Several characteristics of the study group suggested phenomenological differences between obsessive-compulsive disorder and trichotillomania. CONCLUSIONS: Adult trichotillomania is a chronic disorder, frequently involving multiple hair sites, and is associated with high rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Its relation to obsessive-compulsive disorder requires further clarification. The tension-reduction requirement in DSM-III-R for the diagnosis of trichotillomania may be overly restrictive.\r"

Total occlusion (n = 13) and stenosis (n = 11) of the carotid arteries were achieved without complications. The model is easy to produce within a short period and the arterial occlusion resembles human vascular disease. This model has been used to evaluate laser recanalization of vascular obstructions.\r"

Moreover, the sclerosing agent may be employed, in connection with embolization and subsequent surgery, in arteriovenous angiomas with a relevant cutaneous-subcutaneous development. The authors have successfully used the \"interstitial\" sclerosing technique, according to Andrews' method. This technique involves interstitial injections to obtain the sclerosis of the thin threads of fibrous tissue stroma between the blood vessels. The sclerosing therapy may cause the complete regression of \"low flow\" angiomas or, at least, a partial reduction that simplifies the ensuing surgical excision. In the case of partial regression of the angioma obtained with the sclerosing therapy, the surgery of the remaining angioma causes a lesser degree of bleeding (especially in areas that do not particularly lend themselves to surgical exploration, ie, the oral cavity); an increased reliability in the radicality of the intervention (due also to the reduced size of the lesion); and better results from an aesthetic-functional point of view.\r"
