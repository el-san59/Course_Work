  ".W": "Cardiac transplantation has emerged as a standard mode of clinical therapy for end-stage heart failure, while heart-lung transplantation is still an experimental rather than a standard mode of clinical therapy for end-stage heart and lung disease. Since clinical application of heart-lung transplantation began in March 1981, there has been continual improvement in donor care, surgery, post-operative management, and the diagnosis and treatment of lung and heart rejection. According to our 6-year clinical experience, both patients with Eisenmenger's physiology and patients with primary pulmonary hypertension are considered suitable candidates for heart-lung transplantation. In the future, our recipient population will include small children and patients with cystic fibrosis. Suitable candidates must have good liver and kidney function, and freedom from previous major pulmonary emboli, systemic diseases, and previous thoracic surgery. Patients must maintain their functional and emotional status to pass successfully the difficult postoperative period. Proper donor and recipient selection in connection with improved heart-lung preservation has resulted in excellent operative survival (100%) following the last ten operations, and only the lack of suitable donors can limit the number of heart-lung transplantations in the future.\r"

We have measured changes in [Ca2+]i in cat cortex in vivo during ischemia produced by 1 hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion and during 30 minutes of reperfusion. Indo-1, a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, was loaded into the exposed cortex by superfusion, and changes in the [Ca2+]i signal (400/506 nm ratio) were measured microfluorometrically during ultraviolet excitation (340 nm). The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD/NADH) redox state and hemodynamic changes were measured simultaneously. The animals showing severe deterioration in their electroencephalograms (EEG) showed a progressive increase in the [Ca2+]i signal during ischemia (baseline: 1.46 +/- 0.05; 60 minutes after occlusion: 2.99 +/- 0.37; n = 7). At 30 minutes following reperfusion, the animals showing little recovery in their EEG exhibited a further increase in [Ca2+]i (4.71 +/- 0.87, n = 3), whereas animals showing significant recovery in their EEG also showed recovery of [Ca2+]i (1.55 +/- 0.09, n = 4). By contrast, the moderate or mild stroke animals with less deterioration in their EEGs showed no increase in [Ca2+]i during either ischemia or reperfusion. These data suggest that the increase in [Ca2+]i might be closely related not only to deterioration of brain function during ischemia but also to poor recovery during the reperfusion period.\r"

For instance, there is a greater understanding of the diversity of HIV isolates as well as the wide range of potential cells sensitive to infection. The search for a safe, effective vaccine now calls for more caution in the light of the discovery of neutralization-resistant variants and antibody-mediated enhancement of infection. Efforts to control HIV must take into account the various mechanisms of virus entry into host cells, and the processes involved in cytopathic effects. Moreover, the role of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system as reservoirs for HIV particles should be recognized. Together with new information about cytokine induction of HIV, the concept of latent infection of monocytes and macrophages has profound implications for virus persistence and dissemination, especially in the seronegative individual. While many factors about HIV have been uncovered in the past year, several questions remain unanswered and new ones have arisen. For instance, in how many ways does the virus kill in host cell? What causes latency and why does it occur in some but not all hosts? How can virus-filled macrophage vesicles be reached by therapeutic agents or prevented from releasing HIV? What surveillance mechanisms allow some productively infected hosts (cells as well as individuals) to survive beyond expectation? These and other questions should provoke future research on this presently complex and challenging pathogen.\r"

However, the paucity of transmission routes and their susceptibility to strategies of blood screening and of education for behavior modification point in a clear direction for concerted effort. Where they have been applied, blood screening programs have resulted in a dramatic reduction in transfusion-associated infections, and efforts at enhancing donor- and unit-deferral strategies offer promise of further decrease in risk. There is much encouragement in recent reports of education for prevention. While there has been some unevenness in the extent to which successful risk reeducation has occurred, it is nonetheless dramatic compared with prior health educational efforts, and especially so given the exceptional sensitivity of the sexual and illicit drug using behaviors at issue. Finally, clearly articulated public education and particularly correction of misinformation, can contribute significantly to overall prevention efforts by easing fear and enhancing the climate in which persons at behavioral risk of HIV infection can receive and respond to targeted messages.\r"

  ".W": "There is now evidence from a wide variety of geographic areas that many intravenous drug users will change their behavior in order to reduce their risk of developing AIDS. There is even evidence from some areas that the behavior change has led to relative stabilization of seroprevalence rates, although longer-term studies will be needed to establish this definitively. AIDS behavior change in the area of sexual risk reduction appears to be much more difficult than change of drug injection behavior. Conceptual models of AIDS-related behavior change are needed, particularly models that can incorporate the injection of different drugs and variation in social and psychological characteristics among drug injectors. There is increasing evidence for a wider spectrum of HIV-related morbidity and mortality among intravenous drug users than is captured by the current surveillance definition for AIDS, again emphasizing the need for effective prevention programs.\r"

In 13 cases (25%) contact lens wear was the only factor in patients with otherwise healthy eyes using contact lenses as an alternative to spectacles. Gram-negative keratitis was more frequent in the lens wearers, with the exception of therapeutic lens users, than in other patients (p = 0.0006) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused keratitis in cosmetic soft lens users more frequently (p = 0.001). There was no correlation between lens handling or solution contamination in three extended wear soft-lens users. This implies that some soft-lens wearers may be infected by Gram-negative organisms from environmental sources other than contaminated lens care materials. Gram-negative keratitis is strongly associated with contact lens wear, and the diagnosis must be considered in any contact lens user with an acutely painful red eye.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare high fibre diet, basal insulin supplements and a regimen of insulin four times daily in non-insulin dependent (type II) diabetic patients who were poorly controlled with sulphonylureas. DESIGN--Run in period lasting 2-3 months during which self monitoring of glucose concentration was taught, followed by six months on a high fibre diet, followed by six months' treatment with insulin in those patients who did not respond to the high fibre diet. SETTING--Teaching hospital diabetic clinics. PATIENTS--33 patients who had had diabetes for at least two years and had haemoglobin A1 concentrations over 10% despite receiving nearly maximum doses of oral hypoglycaemic agents. No absolute indications for treatment with insulin. INTERVENTIONS--During the high fibre diet daily fibre intake was increased by a mean of 16 g (95% confidence interval 12 to 20 g.) Twenty five patients were then started on once daily insulin. After three months 14 patients were started on four injections of insulin daily. ENDPOINT--Control of diabetes (haemoglobin A1 concentration less than or equal to 10% and fasting plasma glucose concentration less than or equal to 6 mmol/l) or completion of six months on insulin treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS-- No change in weight, diet, or concentrations of fasting glucose or haemoglobin A1 occurred during run in period. During high fibre diet there were no changes in haemoglobin A1 concentrations, but mean fasting glucose concentrations rose by 1.7 mmol/l (95% confidence interval 0.9 to 2.5, p less than 0.01). With once daily insulin mean concentrations of fasting plasma glucose fell from 12.6 to 7.6 mmol/l (p less than 0.001) and haemoglobin A1 from 14.6% to 11.2% (p less than 0.001). With insulin four times daily concentrations of haemoglobin A1 fell from 11.5% to 9.6% (p less than 0.02). Lipid concentrations were unchanged by high fibre diet. In patients receiving insulin the mean cholesterol concentrations fell from 7.1 to 6.4 mmol/l (p less than 0.0001), high density lipoprotein concentrations rose from 1.1 to 1.29 mmol/l (p less than 0.01), and triglyceride concentrations fell from 2.67 to 1.86 mmol/l (p less than 0.05). Patients taking insulin gained weight and those taking it four times daily gained an average of 4.2 kg. CONCLUSIONS--High fibre diets worsen control of diabetes in patients who are poorly controlled with oral hypoglycaemic agents. Maximum improvements in control of diabetes were achieved by taking insulin four times daily.\r"

To predict the numbers of cases of AIDS in the United Kingdom and in East Anglia and Cambridge a two stage approach was chosen using trend extrapolation for the national case reports followed by reduction in scale to the two localities. The method predicted that about 2700 cases would be reported nationally during 1990 and about 6000 during 1992. The number of people with AIDS expected to present for treatment in East Anglia during 1990 was 48, and during 1992 was 105; for Cambridge the corresponding figures were 20 and 43. These figures with their estimated 95% confidence intervals will be used for planning local services for people with AIDS, and they emphasise the need for preventive action.\r"

Similar results were found in a prospective study of the incidence of prostatic cancer in a cohort of Japanese men born in 1900-19 and living in Hawaii. Further evaluation of the extensive anthropomorphic measurements made in this cohort suggested that the association between measures of body mass and prostatic cancer might be accounted for more by lean tissue than by fat tissue. There was a significant positive association of the risk of prostatic cancer with area of muscle in the arm but not with area of fat in the arm. Further research is needed on the biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis that may be related to both lean and fat tissue and the development of prostatic cancer.\r"

Providing beds according to average demand can therefore create a shortage of beds for a large part of the year. It is argued that the norms and targets set by regions should be seen as a starting point for negotiations rather than as the definitive answer for setting the levels of services provided. Because of their particular circumstances certain districts may need to provide more than the levels set by the region, and clinicians and community physicians can work together to provide evidence for this.\r"

The Scots had higher fasting cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and a lower proportion of high density lipoprotein cholesterol than the Sassenachs. Four subjects were found to have hyperlipoproteinaemia, which had been unrecognised previously. Serum cholesterol concentrations did not change after haggis was eaten (mean dose 2.6 g/kg body weight). Serum concentrations of triglycerides increased by 51% at 90 minutes in the Sassenachs but were unaltered in the Scots. There were no serious adverse effects. This study shows that Scots have higher lipid concentrations than Sassenachs but seem to be resistant to the lipaemic effect of haggis. The haggis tolerance test may be useful in Sassenachs.\r"

  ".W": "To achieve optimal hand function, wound closure becomes the most important ingredient in hand burns. This study documents the use of a biosynthetic compound dressing (Biobrane) which has been fabricated as a glove for management of hand burns. The glove allowed rapid active motion and minimized the pain of open wounds. Forty-two Biobrane glove applications were evaluated with 50 per cent applied over superficial hand burns and 50 per cent over deep partial thickness or full thickness injuries. In the superficial hand burns, the patients were discharged home after a mean time of 2.8 days. With the deep burns the dressing provided a closed wound after early excision of eschar without the use of an autograft or biological dressing. Based on these studies, we conclude that the biosynthetic compound dressing glove is a useful adjunct to be added to the armamentarium for treatment of the burned hand.\r"

The local relapse-free rate achieved with radiotherapy was higher in female patients (68%) than male patients (41%) (P = 0.04); the local relapse-free rate was higher in males 60 yr of age or older (46%) than in males 59 yr of age or younger (31%) (P = 0.02). Involvement of all three laryngeal regions and initial tracheotomy were associated with a high primary failure rate. Fifty-nine per cent of patients alive at 5 yr retained and intact and functioning larynx. The time up until diagnosis of recurrence and the number of endoscopies required to establish recurrent or residual disease were all assessed with respect to their effects on survival and were shown to have no significant impact. Methods of improving the results of treatment for those patients with a high primary failure rate following radiotherapy are discussed.\r"

Since cross-resistance among norfloxacin, other quinolones, and cephalosporins can occur, we recommend repeated urine cultures during and after norfloxacin therapy in elderly patients with complicated P. aeruginosa urinary tract infections.\r"

We divided 136 patients who underwent 280 cycles into three groups: (1) previous history of endometriosis but normal pelvis at the time of oocyte retrieval, (2) stages I-II endometriosis (revised AFS classification), and (3) stages III-IV endometriosis. The stimulation protocols, estradiol (E2) responses, and distribution of terminal E2 patterns were similar in all groups. Group 3 had significantly fewer preovulatory and immature oocytes retrieved and fewer embryos transferred. The fertilization rate and the per cycle/per transfer pregnancy rates were similar in all groups. The miscarriage rate was higher in group 3, and the ongoing pregnancy rate per cycle was lower. Luteal phase E2 and progesterone levels were comparable in all groups. No differences were found when groups 2 and 3 were analyzed for the presence of one or two ovaries or the presence/absence of ovarian endometriosis. The overall fertilization rate, the per cycle/per transfer pregnancy rates, and the miscarriage rate were similar to those of tubal factor patients. We underscore the excellent outcome of patients with minimal or mild endometriosis in IVF/ET. We conclude that patients with moderate or severe endometriosis have a compromised reproductive potential, probably because of a reduced oocyte recovery rate and poor embryo quality.\r"

However, the increase in E2 did not correlate with the change in FSH levels or with the number of preovs.\r"

Adsorption of lithium was dependent on AC concentration and pH. In water, lithium was 14.7%, 26.5% and 40.4% adsorbed at AC:Li2CO3 ratios of 5:1, 10:1 and 30:1, respectively (p less than 0.05). In simulated gastric fluid, there was no significant adsorption at any of the AC concentrations studied. Since simulated gastric fluid more closely resembles in vivo conditions, the efficacy of AC in lithium carbonate overdoses is questionable but in vivo studies are needed to confirm these findings.\r"

Sixteen patients undergoing esophagectomy were divided randomly in two equal isonitrogenous groups (0.2 g/kg.day). Both received TPN (35 kcal/kg.day; equally provided as long-chain triglycerides and glucose) over 11 days without (group A) and with (group B) L-carnitine supplementation (12 mg/kg.day = 75 mumol/kg.day). Compared with healthy controls, the total body carnitine pool prior to the operation was significantly reduced in both groups, suggesting a state of semistarvation and muscle wasting. In group A the plasma levels of total carnitine and its subfractions (free carnitine, short- and long-chain acylcarnitine) remained stable during the study whereas in group B the total plasma carnitine concentration rose mainly due to an increase in free carnitine. In group A the cumulative urinary carnitine losses were 11.5 +/- 2.6 mmol (= 15.5 +/- 3.1% of the estimated total body carnitine pool). In group B 3.1 +/- 1.9 mmol (= 11.1 +/- 7.6%) of the infused carnitine was retained in the immediate postoperative phase until day 6, but this amount was completely lost at completion of the study period. No significant differences in the respiratory quotient or in the plasma levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, and ketone bodies were observed, between or within the groups, before the operation and after 11 days of treatment. It is concluded that the usefulness of carnitine supplementation during postoperative TPN was not apparent in the present patient material.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the regulatory role of the immune system on gastrointestinal macromolecular permeability in neonates, and ontogeny of the neonatal immune system, we have developed a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) program capable of maintaining immunologically \"virgin\" germfree (GF) neonatal piglets. GF colostrum-deprived piglets obtained by aseptic hysterectomy 3-5 days prior to term were denied any oral feeding and maintained on central venous hyperalimentation in the GF isolators. GF piglets were anesthetized and 20-gauge silicone tubing was inserted into the external jugular vein and advanced to the level of right auricle of the heart. The distal end of the cannula was subcutaneously tunneled out between the shoulders and attached to a light jacket, tether, and swivel assembly that allowed the piglet to move freely inside the cage in a germfree unit. The TPN formula provided 60 Cal/kg/day for the first day and gradually increased up to 165 Cal/kg/day for day-7 and older piglets. The GF piglets were maintained on the TPN formula for 21 days and weight gain of the GF-TPN piglets averaged 23 g/day. The hematologic and serum biochemical parameters of GF-TPN piglets were within the normal range of gnotobiotic animals of their age group. The serum levels of total protein and albumin in the GF-TPN piglets were significantly less than those of colostrum-fed piglets, who absorbed a large quantity of the colostral macromolecules through their gastrointestinal tract into the blood stream.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the effect of parenteral nutrition on hepatic triglyceride secretion in postoperative patients. Five patients received fluids and electrolytes only (D/S), 10 received a 2000-kcal total parenteral nutrition (TPN) formula with 25% of the nonprotein energy from lipid (LIPID-TPN), and 11 received a similar regimen with all of this energy from dextrose (CHO-TPN). After 7 days an intravenous bolus of 3H-glycerol was given and hepatic triglyceride secretion measured from the decay curve of plasma radiolabeled triglyceride content. Plasma triglyceride concentrations were similar in each group. Hepatic triglyceride secretion was 16.3 mg/kg/hr after D/S, 10.7 mg/kg/hr after LIPID-TPN, and 12.2 mg/kg/hr after CHO-TPN (NS). There was no correlation between the rate of hepatic secretion and dextrose intake. Both TPN regimens resulted in significant reductions in plasma concentrations of apoproteins A1 and B but this did not appear to be related to triglyceride secretion rates. Despite the similar rates of hepatic secretion the quantity of labeled glycerol secreted in triglyceride was significantly greater after CHO-TPN (17629 dpm/24 hr) than either D/S (10560 dpm/24 hr) or LIPID-TPN (7264 dpm/24 hr, p less than 0.05), indicating that recycling of exogenous lipid may have occurred after LIPID-TPN. This study indicates that hepatic triglyceride secretion is not suppressed by TPN, irrespective of the energy source, but suggests that the rate of secretion may have an upper limit.\r"

This study allowed a chronic and dynamic measurement of the major cardiac axes and the ventricular wall thickness, which in turn can be used to derive sophisticated measurements of global and intrinsic left ventricular function. Of the 21 dogs, 11 received a protein- and calorie-deficient diet designed to achieve a mean weight loss from a baseline of 20-25% over a 4-week period. The other 10 dogs received a normal diet. Dogs were also randomized to receive either acute propranolol beta-receptor blockade (n = 9) or acute isoproterenol beta-receptor stimulation (n = 12) during their baseline studies. Of the nine dogs given propranolol, five were subsequently malnourished and four served as controls. Of the 12 given isoproterenol, six were rendered malnourished and six were controls. All dogs were studied at both baseline and 4 weeks and received drugs in an identical fashion during both studies. The significant changes with malnutrition consisted of decreases in heart rate, cardiac mass, and left ventricular wall thickness. The degree of change in stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, dp/dt, and Emax (index of left ventricular contractility), with the administration of propranolol or isoproterenol was unaltered by malnutrition. These data support the contention that moderate protein-calorie malnutrition is well tolerated in instrumented, unstessed dogs and that the left ventricle's capacity to respond to beta-stimulation and to tolerate beta-blockade is largely unimpaired.\r"

Two groups of 17 patients were well matched for age, sex, and nutritional status. Although they underwent diverse operations, the extent of these was similar: 12 +/- 3 days of parenteral nutrition resulted in weight gain, 3.2 +/- 2.3 kg p less than 0.01; increased triceps skinfold, 0.6 +/- 1.2 mm p less than 0.05; improved immunological state, p less than 0.02; and improved PNI, 5.5 +/- 10.1% p less than 0.05. The changes in serum albumin and transferrin were not significant. There were only three major complications with one death in the treatment group but this was not significantly different from the control group which had six major complications and three deaths. This study suggests that patients with demonstrable nutritional depletion who require major gastrointestinal surgery will benefit from a preoperative course of parenteral nutrition, but to conclusively prove this a large and probably multicentre study will be required.\r"

Twelve critically injured patients received a standard enteral formula with 30 g of a 44% branched-chain amino acid supplement added to each liter of formula. Fibronectin concentration, somatomedin-C concentration, and nitrogen balance were measured on study days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 or until adequate oral intake began. Both fibronectin and somatomedin-C concentrations increased significantly from baseline by day 7 of ENS. Nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline by day 4. On days 14 and 21, only somatomedin-C and nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline. Nitrogen balance was significantly correlated with somatomedin-C concentration (r = 0.53, p less than 0.01), cumulative caloric intake (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01), and cumulative nitrogen intake (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that serum somatomedin-C is useful and serum fibronectin has potential in monitoring nutrition support response in critically ill, traumatized patients.\r"

  ".W": "Nitrogen metabolism and plasma insulin level were studied postoperatively in 14 patients (six males and eight females) with a disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and therefore operated on electively. The patients received one of the two isocaloric parenteral nutrition regimens postoperatively: one, on the average, with 1.2 g of amino acids/kg/day and the other with 3.1 g of amino acids/kg/day. During postoperative intravenous alimentation rich in amino acids the cumulative nitrogen balance over 3 days was +13.1 (interval from -1.3 to +21.4) gN but -10.1 (interval from -12.1 to -2.4) gN during parenteral nutrition with a smaller amount of amino acids. The difference was significant (p less than 0.001). During parenteral nutrition rich in amino acids the changes of the serum albumin level, ie, -0.4 (SEM 1.1) g/liter, and of the serum transferrin level, ie; -0.16 (SEM 0.22) g/liter, were statistically insignificant (p greater than 0.05). During intravenous alimentation poor in amino acids serum albumin decreased by 3.8 (SEM 1.2) g/liter (p less than 0.01) and serum transferrin by 0.44 (SEM 0.05) g/liter (p less than 0.001). The differences of the changes between the groups were significant (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01, respectively). These various effects of the two parenteral nutrition regimens were not dependent on the different fluid balances during intravenous alimentation or on the different plasma insulin levels. It is concluded that a rich supply of amino acids--more than 1.2 g/kg/day--in postoperative parenteral nutrition better maintains the visceral protein levels in the serum, which possibly depends on the greater protein production in the liver.\r"

Forty-four (57%) of these infants developed jaundice during the 1st month of life. The incidence of jaundice was significantly higher in the presence of those diseases which were associated with impaired intestinal passage such as congenital duodenal atresia, jejunal atresia, etc, and those with an abnormal rotation of the gut such as diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, etc. Thirty-two (42%) of these 77 infants had accompanying infectious signs, and 28 (88%) of those 32 infants with infectious signs developed jaundice. This incidence was significantly higher than that (36%) among those who had no infectious signs. Of the possible etiologic factors other than infection, neither the length of intrauterine life nor birth weight showed significant correlation with the incidence of jaundice. The incidence of jaundice tended to be higher in infants started on TPN at a younger age. There was no significant correlation between the incidence of jaundice and the duration of TPN or fasting period. Infants receiving 110 cal/kg/day or more during TPN developed jaundice significantly more frequently than those receiving fewer calories. No definite correlation was obtained between the incidence of jaundice and the amount of amino acids administered.\r"

Nine patients showed subnormal serum levels of cobalamin but none of them had clinical signs of cobalamin deficiency. Serum cobalamin levels significantly declined after 2 weeks of TPN as did both saturated and unsaturated R-binder levels whereas transcobalamin II levels remained constant. Since cobalamin in serum is entirely bound to proteins, of which R-binders comprise 80-90%, the changes in R-binder levels will markedly influence serum cobalamin levels, in fact they adequately explain the short time fluctuations of serum cobalamin levels observed. It is argued that the changes in serum cobalamin levels may reflect a changed distribution of cobalamins over the various body compartments rather than decreased or increased body stores. Moreover, only cobalamin bound to transcobalamin II is delivered to the tissues. Therefore, serum cobalamin levels alone may inadequately reflect cobalamin availability in patients receiving TPN.\r"

To diagnose catheter-related sepsis (CRS) and catheter infection (CI), we used a system of pre- and postexchange catheter blood cultures and a catheter tip culture. There were 27 catheter exchanges with positive cultures. The rate of definite CRS/CI (eight instances) was 6.8% of catheters exchanged and 3.5% of all catheters at risk. Probable CRS/CI (11 instances) was seen in 9% of exchanged catheters and 5% of at risk catheters. Thus, 19/27 positive cultures were presumed to represent definite or probable CRS/CI. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (SCN) was the most frequently isolated organism. Simple catheter exchange was usually effective treatment of CRS/CI when SCN was the offending organism. The salvage rate of catheters exchanged for suspected sepsis or after a positive blood culture was 84%. Only 7% of exchanged catheters had to be removed. Guidewire exchange with triple culture technique was without mechanical complications. We recommend this technique to monitor central venous catheters in patients receiving TPN since it is simple, essentially painless to perform, and easily interpreted.\r"

In a series of 54 patients with ocular colobomata, 6 (11%) were found to meet the criteria for CHARGE syndrome. The mnemonic CHARGE stands for the major features of this syndrome: Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, and Ear anomalies and/or hearing loss. No specific etiology is known, but autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked recessive forms have been suggested by familial reports. The authors describe six patients with CHARGE syndrome, including the second reported case occurring in monozygotic twins. Other syndromes, chromosomal defects, and effects of teratogens may have similar clinical presentations. Though our prevalence may be skewed by our referral setting, the frequency of occurrence of this syndrome is certainly high enough that ophthalmologists should be familiar with it. Evaluation for associated defects should be carried out and referral for genetic evaluation undertaken when appropriate.\r"

The results indicate that a relationship exists between the degree of morphologic differentiation and the expression of cytokeratin, MAM-6, and vimentin, as detected by polyclonal antikeratin, 115 D8 and anti-vimentin. Expression of cytokeratin and MAM-6 is reversely related to vimentin. Polyclonal anti-keratin; CAM 5.2, a monoclonal antibody against cytokeratin 8, 18 and 19; and 115 D8, used in combination, were still able to identify the epithelial nature of undifferentiated/spindle cells. Since these immunohistochemical markers precede light microscopic detectable signs of epithelial differentiation, they can be used for the identification of the epithelial nature of undifferentiated/spindle tumors of the head and neck.\r"

The incidence of perilymphatic fistula in a unilateral hearing loss is still unknown. Inner ear-related symptoms in children are scarce, and little diagnostic laboratory testing is available. A definite diagnosis of a perilymphatic fistula can therefore be made only by an exploratory tympanotomy. Four children, ages 5 to 15 years, with a history of a recent and rapidly progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, were explored. Preoperative laboratory data, which included a fistula test, ENG, CT scan of the temporal bones, and an ABR, were all within normal limits. An overt fistula was found in only one of the patients. Only an exploratory tympanotomy can arrest and possibly reverse a unilateral hearing loss or discontinue a middle ear-cranial cavity communication. It is therefore our feeling that, in patients with an appropriate history, the potential benefit outweighs the risk and morbidity of an exploratory tympanotomy.\r"

A statistically significant difference was also demonstrated between the symptomatic pregnant group and the control women with respect to nasal conductance and inspiratory work/liter. Resolution of ETD and nasal obstruction were documented upon repeat testing of pregnant subjects 4 to 10 weeks postpartum. Otologic history and current cigarette-smoking habit were found to predispose women toward ETD (p less than 0.05).

Cytogenetic analysis of the cell line revealed multiple copies of chromosome 7, as well as a homogeneous staining region (HSR) on one chromosome 7. Since overexpression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) cell surface receptors (EGFr) often occurs in other squamous carcinoma cell lines, it was predicted that 584A2 might overexpress EFGr. This was confirmed by: (1) metabolic labeling, with subsequent immunoprecipitation of EGFr and comparing autoradiographs to a cell line without an HSR and fewer copies of chromosome 7, and (2) performing EGF binding assays with Scatchard analysis. Since overexpression of EGFr correlates with an inhibitory effect of EGF on cell culture, the biological effects of EGF on 584A2 were examined in this study. At 5 ng/ml (serum-free medium), EFG stimulated incorporation of [3H] thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material compared with controls. Incorporation increased between days 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 days with a 6- to 7-fold maximum. Dose-response studies (0 to 100 ng/ml) indicated maximum incorporation (6- to 7-fold) occurred between 0.1 ng/ml and 1.0 ng/ml. Cell growth was monitored over 7 days and, during this time, 5 ng/ml EGF produced a 10- to 12-fold increase in absolute cell numbers when compared with controls. We concluded that, unlike other squamous carcinoma lines with elevated EGFr, EGF stimulates rather than inhibits 584A2 cell proliferation.\r"

A standardized approach has been developed in normal subjects that involves differential recording between the TM and adjacent canal wall. A metal annulus on the tip of an ear speculum served as the reference electrode. The speculum was held in place by an adjustable headband. A conductive sponge electrode inserted through the speculum served as the active TM electrode. In clinical trials, nerve potentials recorded from the paralyzed side were abnormal in all patients tested, indicating that nerve pathology could be monitored with this technique. Abnormalities were evident at the first test, within the first day of paralysis for some patients, and well in advance of any abnormality in the electroneuronography (ENoG) response. There appeared to be a relationship between specific waveform abnormalities (e.g., increased peak latency, waveform temporal dispersion, decreased area) and the tendency for a patient to recover from paralysis. These observations suggest that the technique described could serve as a means for early prognosis, at a stage in which nerve damage could still be effectively treated.\r"

A total of 29 mupirocin-treated and 30 erythromycin-treated patients completed the study. None of the mupirocin-treated patients reported adverse experiences compared with 4 erythromycin-treated patients who reported 6 adverse experiences. The mupirocin-treated group had a significantly higher benefit:risk ratio than the erythromycin-treated group as measured by the investigator's global evaluation (P = 0.01). Both treatments eradicated 100% of the two most common pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Results from this study demonstrate that mupirocin is as effective as systemic erythromycin ethylsuccinate for treatment of pyoderma and impetigo.\r"

Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is responsible for normal plasma fibrinolytic activity and has recently become available for clinical use owing to recombinant DNA technology. It has the theoretical advantage of fibrin specificity, which may result in enhanced thrombolytic effects with greater safety. Twenty-three patients with recent lower limb arterial occlusions received t-PA over a tenfold range of concentrations and five patients received low-dose streptokinase. One month after treatment with t-PA or streptokinase 19 (68 per cent) patients had limb salvage, five (18 per cent) had required amputations and four (14 per cent) had died. Systemic fibrinolytic effects were variable but basically dose related. Haemorrhage occurred most frequently at the highest t-PA concentration and was major in four (17 per cent) cases, including a fatal stroke. Plasma fibrinogen concentration fell below 1.2 gl-1 in five (22 per cent) patients who received t-PA and was found to be a significant risk factor for haemorrhage, t-PA was an effective thrombolytic agent at all concentrations studied. The dose currently used in clinical studies at this institution is 0.5 mg h-1.\r"

It has been suggested that it is initiated by venoconstriction at the infusion site, hence treatment with a vasodilator may reduce its incidence. We carried out a prospective double-blind controlled study of the effect of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate on the survival of peripheral intravenous infusions in 340 patients. Fifty-five per cent (94 out of 170) of the infusions failed in the control group compared with 19 per cent (33 out of 170) in the treatment group (chi 2 = 45, P less than 0.0005). The commonest cause of infusion failure was superficial phlebitis: 47 per cent in the control group and 17 per cent in the treatment group (chi 2 = 46, P less than 0.0005). The estimated median time of infusion survival was 74 h in the control group compared with 127 h in the treatment group (log rank chi 2 = 143, P less than 0.0001). We conclude that infusion phlebitis is a common problem in hospitalized patients and its incidence can be effectively reduced by transdermal glyceryl trinitrate.\r"

The model is supported by results of several IDDM case studies as well as by the critical evaluation of the known effects of various lymphokines and lymphotoxins on endocrine target tissues. The possible roles of islet capillary endothelial cells and islet cell antibodies in the pathogenesis of IDDM are discussed.\r"

Efforts are being made to develop simpler and safer methods of transplantation with isolated pancreatic islet grafts, e.g., isolated islets, fetal pancreas, or dispersed adult pancreas. Iso-, allo-, and xenografts of such preparations have been shown to reverse diabetes in animals. However, attempts to apply these techniques in clinical practice have remained largely unsuccessful, and major technical advances are needed before success is achieved. Attempts to use whole, segmented, or isolated islets from pancreatic grafts as a cure for diabetes in animals and in diabetic patients are reviewed. The importance to the graft's permanent function, of adequate preparation and storage of the graft, and of beta-cell growth and vascularization are reviewed. Various forms of immunomodulation by pretreatment of grafts in vitro have been employed in animal models of diabetes, but none of these have yet been employed with long-term success in humans. Recurrence of a specific autoimmune response toward the beta-cell in a spontaneously diabetic recipient is a potential mechanism for destruction of transplanted islet tissue.\r"

  ".W": "We used a novel approach to cost-justify clinical pharmacy services on a general surgery team in nine diagnosis-related group cases. The clinical pharmacist monitored nine patients longitudinally on a general surgery team from admission to discharge and intervened in their therapeutic management. Each recommendation was analyzed for rationale, acceptance, perceived impact on quality and/or cost of patient care, whether self-initiated or solicited, and impact on patient outcome. Types of recommendations and outcomes were categorized by process and outcome measurement criteria. Total cost avoidance per patient was calculated using costs of drug therapy, laboratory tests, and length of stay. Accounting for cost of clinical pharmacy services, net cost avoidance per patient was calculated. The clinical pharmacist made 101 recommendations on nine patients. Physicians accepted 82 percent of the recommendations; 77 percent of the recommendations were self-initiated and 23 percent were solicited. Recommendations had a perceived impact on cost, quality, or both at 13, 31, and 56 percent, respectively. Most recommendations (79 percent) brought patient therapy to a level of conformance with current standards of practice as documented in the medical literature. Recommendations that potentially preserved a major organ function by preventing drug-induced toxicity or the exacerbation of existing problems constituted 16 percent of the total. None of the accepted recommendations adversely affected patient outcome and 23 percent directly resulted in a measurable positive outcome in patient care. A total of four hospital days was potentially saved for two cases. Based on objective outcome criteria, a 1.9-day increase in therapeutic control was documented per patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The initial part of the ictus was short or prolonged for hours with frequent \"marching\" to hemi-convulsions and generalised seizures. Seventeen of the 24 children suffered from benign childhood epilepsies (BCE) with complete remission in long follow-up. A significantly higher association was found between ictal vomiting and the syndrome of BCE with occipital spikes (p less than 0.001) but not with centro-temporal spikes (p less than 0.2). The recognition of this association may have important theoretical implications. On clinical grounds, it may prevent unnecessary investigations and undue concern.\r"

Furthermore, we examined the IL-2 inhibitors to clarify the immunoregulatory mechanism in the lesion. SF from active RA contained a significant amount of IL-1 beta and IL-2 but not gamma-IFN. In contrast IL-2 inhibitor activity was depressed in RA-SF regardless of clinical disease activity. Our results suggest that cytokine overproduction and deficiency of inhibitory signals may result in the overactivity of cytokines and the overactivity may participate in the joint lesions of RA.\r"

Increasing cross-linking at the articular surface might be a new route for therapeutic intervention. However, experiments would be needed to assess the effect of the procedure on the viability and nutrition of chondrocytes and on the functional properties of the tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic alcohol dependence produces persistent amenorrhea in alcoholic women and female Macaque monkeys but the mechanism is unknown. In one amenorrheic alcohol-dependent monkey, prolactin levels increased from 16.5 to 63 ng/ml during chronic, high-dose alcohol self-administration (3.4 g/kg/day) and immunocytochemical examination of the anterior pituitary showed apparent hyperplasia of the lactotrophs. These data suggested that hyperprolactinemia might contribute to alcohol-induced amenorrhea. Four amenorrheic cycles (85-194 days) from two other alcoholic female monkeys that self-administered an average of 2.97 to 4.4 g/kg/day of alcohol were also studied. Each monkey became amenorrheic during the first menstrual cycle that alcohol was available. One monkey developed galactorrhea during a 97-day amenorrheic cycle when alcohol self-administration averaged 3.35 g/kg/day. Although prolactin levels were intermittently elevated above 20 ng/ml, average levels during these amenorrheic cycles (14.7 +/- 1.8 to 19.6 +/- 1.5 ng/ml) did not differ significantly from prolactin levels during normal ovulatory menstrual cycles when no alcohol was available (19.7 +/- 0.36 ng/ml). There was a negative correlation between daily alcohol dose and prolactin levels (p less than .01). High-dose alcohol self-administration was often associated with low normal prolactin levels, but a relative fall in alcohol dose was usually associated with elevated prolactin levels. These data suggest that both alcohol intoxication and relative alcohol withdrawal may alter basal prolactin levels. LH levels were significantly lower during amenorrheic cycles (16.9 +/- 1.2 to 24 +/- 1.4 ng/ml) than during nonalcohol control cycles (28 +/- 1.2 to 30 +/- 2.2 ng/ml) (p less than .001). These data are consistent with clinical data that suggest that hypothalamic amenorrhea is associated with suppression of gonadotropin secretory activity.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to use a quantitative functional and anatomic model to compare surgical repair of the rat sciatic nerve according to two techniques; standard epineurial repair and the recently reported \"nerve reconnection technique\" (\"freeze-trim technique\"). Functional recovery was evaluated using a functional index based on the measurements of the rats' footprints. Neuroanatomic experiments were conducted on the same animals to correlate functional recovery with regeneration of known motoneuron populations. The results of surgical repairs were also compared to those obtained from untreated sciatic nerve crush injuries. Functional recovery after epineurial repairs typically averaged 18%, whereas the mean recovery from the \"nerve reconnection technique\" was 71%. Crush injuries recovered to normal and reached a plateau much earlier than the surgical repairs. Retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeling of motoneurons of the common peroneal nerve, a branch of the sciatic, revealed that there was a complex relationship between functional recovery and the number and distribution of motoneurons that regenerated axons distal to the repair site. The \"nerve reconnection technique\" greatly reduced the probability of axonal misdirection into the wrong distal branches at the repair site and brought an improvement of 300% to 400% in functional recovery over that found with epineurial repair. This technique of nerve repair may prove to be a valuable tool in reconstructive surgery.\r"

Factors such as morbid obesity, general anesthesia recovery, and operative edema can potentially cause desaturations below preoperative levels. Because of this risk, patients with severe OSA have been considered for protective tracheostomy. The findings of our study suggest that selected patients who would have been past candidates for protective tracheostomy while undergoing surgery for severe OSA can, as an alternative, be considered for immediate postoperative use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Ten surgical patients with severe OSA who elected surgical treatment were successfully treated with CPAP immediately after extubation and postoperatively to assist with airway patency and hemoglobin saturation. Postoperative followup included monitoring of continuous pulse oximetry, cardiac activity, and intermittent arterial blood gases. Preoperatively, all ten patients had marked decrease in oxygen desaturation levels during sleep, with a mean nadir oxygen saturation (SaO2) to 51.5%. After surgery, all patients in this group maintained SaO2 levels to no lower than 90%, with a mean SaO2 level of 93% while using CPAP on room air (F10(2) 21%) only.\r"

  ".W": "Several forms of laryngeal dysfunction and pathology can be attributed to the effects of chronic gastric reflux through direct acid irritation, from a reflex alteration in voluntary muscle tone or referred sensation. It is widely accepted that contact ulcers and granulomata over the arytenoid are associated with gastric reflux, but there have not been well-documented cases of glottic carcinoma that are reflux-related. This article presents six cases of glottic carcinoma, all with T1 lesions of the anterior two-thirds of the vocal cord. All of these patients are lifetime nonsmokers, and all had no other ailments other than moderately severe chronic gastroesophageal reflux. Clinical details from the study of these patients gives strong indication that the reflux may have been a factor in the development of the disease. In addition, review of 21 lifetime nonsmokers with glottic carcinoma presenting over a 10-year period at the Cancer Control Agency of British Columbia revealed that 48% had probably experienced reflux, compared to 16% in a group that had stopped smoking 10 or more years earlier. While this small number of cases cannot be said to prove the etiologic relationship between reflux and glottic carcinoma, it is important for the otolaryngologic community to be aware of the possible clinical relationship.\r"

At high strains, the stiffness of treated cartilage ranged from 12.8 to 22.5 MPa and was unaffected by storage time. In comparison, irradiated and freeze-dried nasal septum exhibited stiffnesses of 35 and 37.5 MPa, respectively, after approximately 1 month of storage. These values of stiffness were significantly different from controls at a 0.95 confidence level. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that Alcide and Merthiolate treatment did not alter the compressive mechanical properties of cartilage and that a combination of these treatments may adequately sterilize and preserve nasal septum homografts.\r"

Analysis of ABRs revealed threshold increases of 10 to 15 dB across all frequencies at 1 hour and 7 days. However, thresholds returned to pre-fistula levels by 28 days. Animals with acute fistulas (simple laceration of the round window) had similar threshold increases at 1 hour; however, recovery to baseline levels occurred by day 7. Control animals with intact round windows did not have threshold shifts. Scanning electron microscopy revealed hair cell loss localized to the apical and basal turns of the cochlea. The morphologic changes observed occurred acutely (within 7 days) and were not progressive, despite the presence of a fistula. Hair cell loss or degeneration did not correlate with hearing loss.\r"

Review of the current English language literature reveals seven additional case reports of otologic glomus tumors in children less than fourteen years of age. Two additional cases are presented that were given to the senior author by personal communication, producing a total of 10 cases for review. Glomus tumors in children may be hidden by otitis media and appear more likely to be endocrine active. Failure to cure the lesion is apparent in five of six case reports of children with glomus jugulare tumors; three of these children are reported to have expired. Complete surgical extirpation is advocated for childhood glomus tumors.\r"

The translabyrinthine approach was used in 64% of cases, the suboccipital approach in 35%, and the middle fossa approach in 1%. There were minor differences in morbidity and mortality between approaches. These data did not favor one approach over another.

  ".W": "The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), which is found in a population of cholinergic parasympathetic neurons in the airways, has no effects per se on mucociliary activity. In order to test the hypothesis that VIP may modulate cholinergic regulation of the mucociliary system, VIP was infused intraarterially (8.4 pmol/kg/min), and the response to challenges with methacholine in the maxillary sinus of rabbits were recorded with a photoelectric technique. Occurrence of VIP-like immunoreactivity in the rabbit maxillary sinus, maxillary nerve, and sphenopalatine ganglion was investigated. Immunoreactivity against VIP was found in nerve fibers in the subepithelial layer of the maxillary sinus and in numerous nerve cell bodies in the sphenopalatine ganglion. Infusion of VIP potentiated the mucociliary increase induced by methacholine. The mucociliary wave frequency change increased from 6.1% +/- 1.7% to 13.3% +/- 3.9% (0.01 micrograms/kg methacholine), from 11.6% +/- 3.6% to 18.8% +/- 2.2% (0.05 micrograms/kg) and from 17.0% +/- 3.0% to 27.4% +/- 3.6% (0.1 micrograms/kg). Both peak responses and response durations increased during infusions. In contrast, the vasodilating agent papaverine sulphate did not influence the mucociliary response to methacholine. The modulating effect of VIP on the mucociliary system, taken together with the morphologic observations, suggest that VIP may have a physiologic role in the regulation of the mucociliary system in the maxillary sinus.\r"

The bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled methacholine of 12 recipients of heart-lung transplants was compared with that of 12 recipients of heart transplants having similar medication and 12 normal subjects. The median dose of methacholine that produced a reduction of at least 20% in the FEV1 (PC20) for the recipients of heart-lung transplants (8 mg/ml) was significantly lower than that for the recipients of heart transplants (64 mg/ml) and normal subjects (greater than 64 mg/ml). The increased airway reactivity may be related to the effects of chronic pulmonary denervation or subclinical inflammation in the airways. The effect of denervation on the response to full inspiration during bronchoconstriction was studied in six patients with heart-lung transplants by means of partial and maximal forced expiratory manoeuvres. Four showed bronchodilation after a deep breath, indicating that this response can occur after extrinsic pulmonary denervation in man. The patients with heart-lung transplants described a \"tight\" sensation in the anterior chest during bronchoconstriction, indicating that this sensation is not dependent on pulmonary innervation.\r"

  ".W": "Growing evidence suggests that biochemical mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. Cartilaginous wear particles have been shown to induce destructive enzymes and cytokines. To assess the biocompatibility of artificial ACL replacements, the effects of wear particles from the following ligaments were analyzed biochemically and histologically: GORETEX, Stryker Dacron Ligament Prosthesis, Versigraft carbon, Kennedy LAD, Xenograft, Leeds-Keio, and human patellar tendon allograft. Ligaments were frozen and ground to produce wear particles similar to those seen clinically and were added to lapine synovial cell cultures. The resulting conditioned medium was analyzed for collagenase, gelatinase, and chondrocyte activating factor (CAF) production. All of the ligaments induced significantly elevated enzyme and CAF production by the synoviocytes, with Xenograft and carbon inducing significantly higher enzyme levels than those of the other five ligaments. Five milligrams of wear particles were injected into the knees of 4 kg to 5 kg rabbits that were analyzed histologically after 14 weeks. Wear particles accumulated in the periarticular synovial folds and induced modest to severe macrophage infiltration in the synovium. A hypothetical model explaining the role of artificial ligament wear particles in the pathogenesis of arthritis is presented.\r"

One hundred thirty-nine patients were admitted to the study. Patients received either 150 mg (75 mg twice daily) of diclofenac (N = 69) or 3.6 g (1.2 g three times daily) of aspirin (N = 70) for 3 to 10 days. Forty-seven diclofenac patients and 49 aspirin patients, mean age for both groups 25 years, were evaluated to determine the efficacy of each treatment. Both groups experienced significant (P less than 0.001) improvements for all efficacy variables measured. Treating sprains and strains with diclofenac rather than with aspirin allowed an earlier return to activity. Of those patients who achieved playing fitness, those in the diclofenac group resumed athletic activities in a mean of 4.7 days, compared with a mean of 5.9 days for patients in the aspirin group. Although the overall multivariate F was nonsignificant (P = 0.19), the univariate F for days required to resume playing fitness was significantly (P = 0.025) shorter in the diclofenac group. While the nonsignificant multivariate result suggests that the significance may be due to chance, it is also possible that there was a trend toward earlier resumption of activities with diclofenac treatment compared to aspirin, but an insufficient sample size to demonstrate the trend statistically. Since others have reported such a trend without the greater controls of a multivariate analysis, this area warrants further research.\r"

  ".U": "89192191\r", 
  ".W": "The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease that can be transmitted from human to mouse with immunoglobulin G (IgG). Electrophysiological studies indicate that LEMS IgG acts on presynaptic voltage-sensitive calcium channels, probably reducing their number, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy demonstrates that LEMS IgG has an effect on the presynaptic active zone particles, which represent putative voltage-sensitive calcium channels. The active zone particles, normally arranged in double parallel rows, move closer together, form clusters, and are reduced in number. The morphological data suggest modulation of the active zone particles crosslinked by LEMS IgG. If this were the case, then only divalent LEMS IgG and F(ab')2 should alter the deployment of active zone particles and monovalent Fab should be without effect. To test this hypothesis, mouse diaphragms were exposed to control and LEMS IgG and IgG fragments in organ culture for 24 hours and then studied by quantitative freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Divalent LEMS IgG and F(ab')2 aggregated and depleted the active zone particles, whereas monovalent Fab had no effect. The findings reconfirm that the active zone particles are targets of LEMS IgG and are direct evidence for modulation of the particles by LEMS IgG. The findings are in harmony with parallel electrophysiological studies of the effects of LEMS IgG fragments on transmitter release in the same diaphragm muscles (Lang et al, J Physiol 1987;390:173P).\r"

The 5 patients, 3 boys and 2 girls, ranged in age from 10-15 years. Computed tomography revealed no gross abnormalities. Each patient received 2-5 mCi of 2-(18F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) intravenously. Averaged cerebral glucose metabolic rates were reduced in each cerebral region as compared with controls. Unilateral hypometabolism was present in 4 patients: one in the inferior frontal gyrus as well as the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus; one in the inferior frontal gyrus; one in the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus; and one demonstrated diffuse hemispheric hypometabolism including the inferior frontal and posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus. The side of hypometabolism was the same as the epileptogenic focus on the electroencephalogram. No focal changes were demonstrated on the electroencephalogram of a patient whose positron emission tomography revealed hemispheric hypometabolism. Hypometabolism of the inferior frontal and posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus may relate to the possible pathogenesis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Positron emission tomography has the potential to reveal a latent focal or lateralized abnormality in some patients with non-localized electroencephalographic changes.\r"

All 7 patients were responding poorly to phenobarbital, phenytoin, or carbamazepine. Six of them responded to valproate. Two patients became seizure-free during valproate monotherapy. A succinimide was required as a second antiepileptic drug in 3 patients to achieve seizure control. Repeated episodes of \"febrile status epilepticus\" in 2 patients were controlled with lorazepam. Five of 7 patients are doing significantly better than the literature would suggest is possible. Seizure control can be achieved in SMEI with aggressive use of drugs which are beneficial for myoclonic seizures. Traditional drugs for tonic-clonic seizures are of little or no benefit in SMEI.\r"

The neuropathologic and clinical sequelae of perinatal asphyxia are likely attributable to alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) to the developing brain with uncoupling of CBF and metabolism. The newborn beagle puppy model was used to study the control of CBF in physiologic and pathologic conditions in the developing brain. Pups, 2-10 days of age, were randomized to asphyxial insult (i.e., ventilator lines clamped for 5 min) or no insult. In the first series, pups underwent radioactive microsphere determinations of CBF immediately prior to insult (t = 0), at the end of insult (t = 5), and after 60 min of observation (t = 65). In the second series, utilizing a 2.0 tesla superconducting magnet, pups underwent continuous serial in vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectral analysis of cerebral hemispheric metabolic state. Animals exposed to insult had significant alterations in PO2, PCO2, pH, and mean arterial pressure at the end of insult compared to control pups (all pups: p less than 0.001). Serial CBF data demonstrated decreases in flow in cortical gray and white matter regions during insult and return to baseline 1 hour later; brainstem structures were hyperemic during insult. Analysis of phosphorylated metabolites inorganic phosphorus (Pi), phosphocreatine (PCr), and ATP demonstrated that during insult both the PCr/Pi and ATP/Pi ratios were depressed but by 20-30 min following insult, these ratios of cerebral phosphorylated metabolites had almost returned to baseline values. These data demonstrate that even after a severe asphyxial episode which results in electrocerebral silence, CBF and metabolism may return to normal.\r"

Nine patients (15%) had simple partial and atypical absence seizures. Twenty-four patients (40%) had pseudoseizures presenting as rhythmic movements or staring. Pseudoseizure frequency was greater than the frequency of true seizures; brief staring episodes were common. Motor pseudoseizures usually were of longer duration than true seizures and could be brought on with verbal encouragement. Furthermore, the stereotypic motor presentations were quite different from those of true motor seizures but were difficult to recognize from historic, clinical, and routine electroencephalographic data.

Electron microscopy demonstrated that the membrane-bound vacuoles were present in muscle fibers, subsarcolemmal area, vascular endothelial cells, satellite cells, and endomysial fibroblasts. Besides clinical features, this ultrastructural pathology in MPS IIA muscles of MPS IIA was more severe than MPS IIB muscles. The accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in muscle tissue may be an additional factor contributing to gradual motor impairment of patients with MPS IIA.\r"

We investigated hemodynamic and oxygen (PO2) changes in 19 patients: group 1 (17 patients) had no spontaneous ventilations at PCO2 values ranging from 37-129 torr; group 2 (2 patients) had spontaneous ventilations at less than 38 torr. Group 1 was separated into 2 subgroups: A (10 patients) with PO2 greater than 153 torr and B (7 patients) with PO2 less than 80 torr. Hemodynamic changes (less than 10% variation in baseline pulse and blood pressure) occurred in 9 of 10 patients in group 1A and all patients in Group 1B. Mean differences in pulse and blood pressure changes between these groups were not significant; therefore, pulse and blood pressure changes are not predictive of hypoxemia and hypercarbia is not necessary to induce spontaneous ventilation in patients with intact medullary function.\r"

Thirty of the 65 cases were accepted as AIDS cases (August 1987 Centers for Disease Control criteria) only because of the tuberculosis. Among the cases 54 (83%) were parenteral drug addicts and 88% were males. The tuberculosis was pulmonary or pleural in 62 controls (96%) but in only 25 cases (39%; P less than 0.0001). Lymph nodes were involved in 25 cases (39%) and in none of the controls (P less than 0.0001). Disseminated forms of tuberculosis were present in seven cases (11%) and in no controls (P less than 0.007). Bone, joints and central nervous system involvement were also significantly (P less than 0.05) more frequent in cases. The treatment (isoniazid and rifampin for 6 months plus ethambutol and pyrazinamide during the first 2 months) was always effective. One relapse was detected after a median follow-up of 55 months in cases and none in controls after a median follow-up of 43 months. Twenty-five cases (39%) and 14 controls (22%) developed mild or severe side effects related to the treatment (P less than 0.004). In conclusion, most of the HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis were drug addicts with extrapulmonary or disseminated forms. A short course of treatment (6 or 9 months) may be enough but side effects were frequent.\r"

These results, taken together with those of Ouattara et al. showing that both retroviruses have a similar seroprevalence in the general rural and urban populations, suggest that HIV-2 may have a lower physiopathological potential than HIV-1. This suggestion is supported by a 6-month follow-up of 60 AIDS cases, but only longer follow-up of cohorts of patients and healthy subjects with antibodies to one of the two viruses will allow definitive conclusions.\r"

Two children were persistently seropositive and had laboratory and clinical evidence of HIV infection but had no detectable infectious HIV in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Seven children, all of whom had clinical and laboratory evidence of HIV infection, were seropositive and virus culture-positive. One child who died at 10 months of age of candida septicemia was HIV antibody-negative but HIV was grown from cultures of his PBMC. Six children had no serologic or virologic evidence of HIV infection; of these, four who were asymptomatic with normal laboratory studies were HIV antibody-positive up to 12 months of age but became antibody-negative by 15 months of age. These observations indicate that: (1) as many as 60% of infants of infected mothers may be infected with HIV; (2) maternal antibody can result in a false-positive or false-negative diagnosis of HIV infection in infants exposed in utero or perinatally, and (3) the use of viral cultures for HIV is valuable for the early diagnosis of maternally transmitted HIV infection.\r"

Prevalence studies have shown that 10-18% develop anti-HBc in the absence of detectable anti-HBs. We report four such cases, all with persistence of serum anti-HBc, who had evidence of a second period of active HBV replication as demonstrated by the reappearance of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). In one patient, an HBsAg subtype difference indicated that the second period of HBsAg-positivity was due to a reinfection. In the other cases, reactivation may also explain the findings. All cases were anti-HIV-1 seropositive at the time of reappearance of HBsAg. There is experimental evidence that anti-HBc has a protective effect against HBV infection; however, this may require intact cell-mediated immunity to be effective. HIV-1 infection may render such patients susceptible to reinfection. Alternatively, some patients with anti-HBc, but without detectable anti-HBs may have latent HBV infection. Immunosuppression associated with HIV-1 infection may allow reactivation.\r"

This dose was found to be inhibitory for several strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Low molecular weight fractions of the compound were less active against HIV, and high molecular derivatives were as active as HOE/BAY 946. A direct influence of the drug on the infectivity of the virus could not be demonstrated. The drug inhibited the reverse transcriptase of HIV. Treatment of permanently HIV-infected U937 cells resulted in a drastic reduction of virus particles released into the supernatant and points to an additional mode of action. A therapeutic effect of HOE/BAY 946 against retroviruses in vivo could be demonstrated in Friend leukaemia virus-infected mice. A clinical pilot study with the compound was started recently in Germany with AIDS patients who did not tolerate or refused to take zidovudine and with asymptomatic virus carriers.\r"

Various methods of separating virus and cells were assessed: results showed that gentle homogenization in a Tenbroek-type homogenizer yielded considerably more virus than other techniques. Virus obtained in this way mainly appeared in the form of large clumps. Because of the large numbers of virus particles obtained it was possible to visualize what is probably the immature form of the virus. The inner component of this particle is spherical and, as is discussed, is a transient form proceeding to the now well established, mature, cone-shaped virus core.\r"

A comparison of ADCC towards these two retroviruses, under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, indicates major differences between the capacity of HTLV-I-seropositive sera and HIV-1-seropositive sera to mediate ADCC. In all cases, HIV sera showed low-titre ADCC, in contrast to the high titre (greater than 1:800,000) ADCC mediated by HTLV-I-positive sera. Both sets of sera showed the prozone phenomenon, and heat inactivation may abolish ADCC towards HIV-1-infected cells. Quantitation of surface antigen expression on HTLV-I- and HIV-1-infected cell lines indicated the presence of easily detectable amounts of virus-specific antigen. We conclude that, in contrast to some previous reports, ADCC mediated by HIV-1-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody is rather weak and of low titre when compared with HTLV-I ADCC. This is true for all cell lines and HIV-1 virus isolate combinations tested.\r"

AIDS cases among Asians and Pacific Islanders have increased 177% since 1985 compared with 54% in other racial and ethnic groups, with the greatest increase in homosexual and bisexual men and transfusion recipients. Among Asian and Pacific Islander ethnic groups, the incidence of AIDS was 168 cases per 100,000 in Polynesians, 141 per 100,000 in Japanese, 92 per 100,000 in 100 Filipinos, 72 per 100,000 in southeast Asians, and 21 per 100,000 in Chinese.

The results of the confirmatory assays (Western blot, immunofluorescence), combined with clinical information, were used as the reference standard for the detection of HIV-1 antibodies in 10,676 random blood donor serum specimens, in a panel of 840 specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and a total of 63 serial blood specimens from 23 people at risk. With fresh blood donor sera, the specificity of the first-generation assay ranged between 99.54 and 99.76% (95% confidence limits, CL) compared with 99.81-99.95% (95% CL) for the second-generation EIA. With panel specimens the recombinant HIV-1 EIA achieved an overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity range of 98.3-99.7% (95% CL); the corresponding sensitivity and specificity ranges observed for the first-generation EIA were 98.0-99.5% (95% CL) and 94.3-96.8% (95% CL), respectively. The improved sensitivity for the second-generation assay was confirmed by testing serial samples from seroconverting patients. The use of recombinant proteins eliminated non-specific reactions due to class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-directed antibodies.\r"

The clinical features of the 55 patients with nasopharyngeal malignancy presenting to the Glasgow hospitals since 1970 have been analysed, and the incidence of malignancy in all adults presenting with middle ear effusions has been assessed in order to define the association of the 2 conditions. The study confirmed that while an effusion is commonly associated with a nasopharyngeal tumour (33%), in only 2% was it the sole clinical manifestation at the initial consultation. In addition, adults with effusions, but without other symptoms and signs suggestive of a tumour, are unlikely to harbour a tumour, the incidence in this review being 0.4%. Therefore, an examination and biopsy of the nasopharynx under general anaesthesia is likely to give a very low yield of additional information in cases of isolated middle ear effusions in adults, and the cost effectiveness of the procedure should be questioned.\r"

Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin activity and aldosterone were determined. All patients had vector- and echocardiographic evidences of slight to moderate left ventricular hypertrophy. The body weight decreased 2.0 kg (3.3 +/- 0.5%) with dialysis. Nine out of ten patients showed a slightly reduced ejection fraction that normalized after dialysis (p less than 0.05). Left atrial and ventricular systolic dimensions were around the upper reference limit before dialysis with a decrease after dialysis (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.02, respectively). The levels of ANP decreased with dialysis from 2-17 times to 1 to 15 times the upper reference value in nine out of the ten patients. In the whole group the decrease was 117 +/- 35% (p less than 0.005). A significant regression was obtained between percentage decrease of body weight and percentage change of ANP (r = 0.67; p less than 0.05). The plasma concentration of ADH did not change following dialysis but the mean value was significantly higher than the mean value of the reference group of the laboratory (p less than 0.05 before and p less than 0.005 after dialysis). Renin activity and aldosterone levels were low and did not change during dialysis. In conclusion, the slight left ventricular hypertrophy may partly be a response to volume overload with hyperdynamic circulation and partly to metabolically depressed myocardial function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Furthermore, correlations with the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system and hemodynamic alterations were studied. The mean value of IR-hANF was significantly (p less than 0.002) higher in normotensive IgAN patients (68.2 +/- 14.6 pg/ml) than in controls (48.8 +/- 11.5 pg/ml), while it was slightly and not significantly elevated in hypertensive IgAN patients (58.5 +/- 8.4 pg/ml). In the latter the mean plasma renin activity (PRA) was significantly increased (0.92 +/- 0.30 ng/ml/h; p less than 0.002), while in normotensive IgAN patients (0.68 +/- 0.58 ng/ml/h) no difference was observed. Plasma aldosterone levels showed the same behavior pattern as those of PRA.

The average stay was nearly five days and patients received 8.6 drugs per day for a total average exposure of 12.2 different drugs. Antibiotics and analgesics were used in over 90 percent of patients. The patients' diagnoses fit into 53 different diagnosis-related groups (DRG). Hospital costs were significantly greater than DRG payment for an average revenue loss of $17,803 per patient. Patients with a primary diagnosis of sepsis had the largest revenue loss, averaging $54,738. One hundred patients were revenue losers. Total hospital stay was statistically longer than DRG-projected length of stay. Pharmacy charges averaged 13.6 percent of total hospital charges. Patients receiving systemic antifungals, triple antibiotics, catecholamines, and total parenteral nutrition had high hospital and pharmacy costs. This study suggests that ICU patients are costly to hospitals and that drug use is expensive. We suggest that increased pharmacy involvement in the care of ICU patients may help curtail escalating drug costs in these patients.\r"

Sixty-two children aged 5 months to 13 years with impetigo were assigned to be treated with either mupirocin in three daily applications or erythromycin ethylsuccinate (40 mg/kg of body weight per day divided into four doses) according to a randomized treatment schedule. On the initial visit, exudate or cleansed infected sites or both were cultured and therapy was begun. All patients were treated for 8 days. Patients were seen again on days 4 to 5 of therapy, at the end of therapy, and 7 days after the end of therapy. Sites of infection were comparable between the groups, as were bacteriologic responses. At the first visit, 24 of 30 children in the mupirocin group and 14 of 32 children in the erythromycin group were cured or had at least a 75% reduction in size of the lesions. At the end of the study, all 29 of the children in the mupirocin group who came to follow-up, compared with 27 of 29 in the erythromycin group, were cured. Side effects were few. Five children in the erythromycin group developed mild diarrhea. Thus, mupirocin appears to be safe and effective in treating impetigo in children. Our data show a trend toward more rapid clinical response with mupirocin than with erythromycin.\r"

Norfloxacin, a more potent inhibitor of DNA gyrase and an analog of nalidixic acid, nearly abolished the production of transformants by recipient cells. On the contrary, exposure of competent cells to nalidixic acid had no effect on transformant yield. The target of these inhibitors appears to be at the level of recombination.

MICs for fecal microorganisms are with few exceptions far below these levels. Nevertheless, clinical investigations show that the main part of the aerobic gram-positive and the anaerobic microflora remains unaffected after norfloxacin administration. In this study, the binding of [14C]norfloxacin to fecal material was analyzed. The binding of a group of nonlabeled quinolones to feces and the interactions between Enterococcus faecium, Bacteroides fragilis, and norfloxacin were also investigated. The results showed that norfloxacin has the ability to bind to feces. The specific binding was reversible, saturated after 90 min of incubation at 37 degrees C, and increased linearly with fecal concentration. Scatchard plots and nonlinear regression computer analyses revealed two different binding classes. The primary specific binding had a dissociation constant (KD) of 1.0 microM and a maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 0.12 mumol/g of feces. The KD and Bmax of the secondary, more unspecific binding were 450 microM and 11.8 mumol/g of feces, respectively. The binding of unlabeled ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, and norfloxacin to feces was comparable to that of [14C]norfloxacin. The results of norfloxacin binding to suspensions of B. fragilis suggested that the main part of the binding is to the bacterial fraction of feces. In the presence of 8.0 g (dry weight) of B. fragilis per liter, the MBC of norfloxacin for E. faecium increased from 8 to 256 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hyperglycemia causes an expansion of extracellular volume, which induces a vasodilatory response. Hemodynamic adaptation to vasodilation leads to an increase in intracapillary hydraulic pressure, which subsequently causes vascular damage. In experimental animals, restoration of capillary pressure to normal levels by ingestion of a low-protein diet or administration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor has been shown to prevent microvascular damage in the kidney, and dietary protein restriction limits injury in the retina as well. Atrial natriuretic peptide, which is secreted by atrial myocytes in response to volume expansion, may be involved in mediation of the hemodynamic adaptation (vasodilatory response) that results in diabetic microvascular disease.\r"

The children with very high dose requirements were significantly lighter, shorter, and had less body surface area than the control group. Of the pharmacokinetic parameters studied, total and intrinsic clearance, distribution volume, and valproic acid free fraction were significantly increased in the very high dose group. In three patients who were investigated after co-medications were eliminated, clearances and dosage requirements decreased by more than 50%. We concluded that very high VPA dosages are sometimes required to achieve therapeutic serum drug concentrations and that this therapy occasionally improves seizure control. There were no adverse effects of very high dose therapy that required dosage reduction.\r"

The distribution of the diameters of myelinated nerve fibers did not clearly demonstrate a bimodal pattern. However, larger fibers of 8 microns or more in diameter were more abundant. This finding correlated with the motor conduction velocity which was within normal limits for his age. A striking feature was the accumulation of glycogen particles in Schwann cells of both myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers. The accumulation of glycogen particles was more prominent in Schwann cells of myelinated nerve fibers than in those of unmyelinated ones. The reason for this finding is unclear. The accumulation of glycogen particles in nerve fibers was less than that found in muscle fibers. These morphologic differences between muscle and peripheral nerve fibers may represent an intrinsic difference between the two tissues; glycogen turnover may be faster in muscle than in nerve cells.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1981 and December 1985 336 patients with deep partial and full skin thickness burn injuries covering more than 20 per cent of the body surface area (BSA) were treated in our burn unit. During the first 3.5 years prophylactic therapy for stress ulcers consisted of cimetidine or ranitidine whereas during the last 18 months a combination of ranitidine and sucralfate was used. Over the whole period a protein-rich enteral feeding was instituted as early as possible after injury. Six times 200 mg/day cimetidine were administered intravenously during the first 4-6 days after injury, followed by a reduction to 4 x 200 mg/day usually until the end of the third week. Subsequently cimetidine was given orally in doses of 5 x 200 mg/day. Ranitidine (3 x 112 mg) was given intravenously until enteral feeding started, usually for the first 4 days, after oral nutrition had started the dosage was reduced to 3 x 56 mg/day. Over the past 18 months 4 x 1 g/day granular powdered sucralfate in combination with 3 x 56 mg/day ranitidine were given. The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.5 per cent and no patient required surgical therapy. With respect to prophylaxis of bleeding and perforation of stress ulcers the triple regimen using sucralfate, ranitidine in low dosages and protein-rich enteral feeding appeared to be as effective as the earlier use of cimetidine or ranitidine. Side-effects of H2-blockade treatment, especially the high incidence of pneumonias caused by ascending infection from the gastrointestinal tract, were not seen. The high incidence of diarrhoea during H2-blockade treatment in combination with high protein enteral feeding remains to be solved.\r"

  ".U": "89293663\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of nicotine on the secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were examined in conscious rabbits. Nicotine was shown to produce significant increases in plasma AVP from 1.7 +/- 0.4 to 75.3 +/- 35.1 pg/ml (P less than .05) and in plasma ANF levels from 39 +/- 11 to 121 +/- 52 pg/ml (P less than .05) within 5 min of an i.v. dose of 0.5 mg/kg. These nicotine-induced stimulations could not be inhibited by muscarinic (atropine), dopaminergic [(+/-)-sulpiride], alpha (phenoxy-benzamine) or beta adrenergic (propranolol) blockers or by a rapid infusion of fluids. Trimetaphan was ineffective in blocking the stimulation of AVP secretion but completely abolished the nicotine-induced secretion of ANF. The more lipophilic ganglionic blocker, mecamylamine, blocked the stimulation of the secretion of both peptides. The effect of nicotine on AVP production was confirmed in vitro using the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system preparation where nicotine increased AVP secretion in a dose-dependent manner. This in vitro stimulation was blocked by the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium. The increase in ANF plasma concentrations was probably due to a primary response to nicotine, for although exogenous AVP (1 microgram i.v.) increased ANF levels by a factor of 3 (P less than .05), the AVP antagonist [-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid)-2- (O-methyl)tyrosine]arginine vasopressin did not prevent the nicotine-induced increase in ANF. Thus, nicotine or its effects appear to stimulate the secretion of ANF and not AVP. It was concluded that nicotine stimulates the secretion of AVP by activating central nicotinic projections to the hypothalamus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Superfusion with 10(-6) to 10(-4) M arachidonic acid resulted in a slow developing positive inotropic effect (PIE) in a concentration-dependent manner. The PIE was abolished by pretreatment with 10(-5) M indomethacin. Prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha also produced a significant PIE in a concentration-dependent manner, but the EC50 value was approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower and the maximum contractile response was 2-fold higher than those of arachidonate. PGE2 and PGI2 were without an effect on contractile force at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M. Both arachidonate and PGF2 alpha provoked slow responses in the partially depolarized muscles in a time course similar to that of development in the PIE. Neither arachidonate nor PGF2 alpha affected tissue levels of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, but these molecules increased accumulations of [3H]inositol phosphates (IPs) in a concentration-dependent manner similar to that observed for their PIE. The enhanced accumulation of [3H]IPs induced by arachidonate was abolished by pretreatment with 10(-5) M indomethacin. Although an increase in [3H]IP level was relatively rapid in PGF2 alpha-treated tissues, maximum accumulations of [3H]IPs were identical between arachidonate- and PGF2 alpha-treated tissues. Thus, for comparable increases in [3H]IPs, there was a greater PIE with PGF2 alpha than with arachidonate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The alkylating agent para-bromophenacyl bromide (PBPB) has been reported to block endothelium-dependent relaxation of arteries, presumably by inhibiting phospholipase in the endothelium. We have investigated the site of action of PBPB-induced inhibition of melittin (MEL)- and bradykinin (BK)-stimulated endothelium-dependent relaxation and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cyclic GMP (cGMP) accumulation. Studies were performed using short-term co-cultures of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (EC) grown on microcarrier beads and rat aortic VSM. The culture system allowed separate pretreatment of ECs and VSM cells with PBPB (3 X 10(-5) M) before placement of the two cell types in co-culture. Because PBPB is an alkylating agent, it was felt that any blockade would endure after washout. Intracellular (VSM) concentrations of cGMP rose in response to MEL or BK stimulation only when EC were present, and were not decreased when only the EC had been pretreated with PBPB. cGMP accumulation induced by MEL or BK was significantly (P less than .01) inhibited in co-cultures where either the VSM alone or VSM and EC combined were pretreated with PBPB. The PBPB pretreatment adequately blocked EC phospholipase activity as measured by attenuation of the release of [3H]arachidonate from prelabeled EC by MEL. In parallel studies, when endothelium-derived relaxing factor was transferred by superfusion of EC to denuded rabbit aortic rings contracted with phenylephrine and pretreated with PBPB, the relaxation response induced by MEL or BK was inhibited. Similarly, when endothelium-derived relaxing factor was transferred to wells of cultured VSM pretreated with PBPB, cGMP accumulation was inhibited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The marine natural produce manoalide has been reported to inactivate venom phospholipase A2 from several sources and phospholipase A2 from polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In this investigation, the regulation of eicosanoid production was studied both in an in vitro and in an in vivo model. The release of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E2 was inhibited by manoalide when cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (apparent IC50 = 0.23 microM), calcium ionophore A23187 (apparent IC50 = 0.23 microM) and zymosan (apparent IC50 = 0.18 microM). Leukotriene C4 production was inhibited by manoalide when macrophages were stimulated by A23187 (IC50 = 0.35 microM) but was enhanced when the cells were stimulated with zymosan. In an in vivo model, manoalide antagonized zymosan-induced peritoneal writhing in the mouse (ED50 = 0.71 mg/kg) and inhibited the i.p. release of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (ED50 = 0.2 mg/kg) and leukotriene C4 (ED50 = 0.24 mg/kg). Our results suggest that: 1) manoalide modifies arachidonic acid release and metabolism to prostaglandins and leukotrienes in mouse cultured peritoneal macrophages stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate, calcium ionophore A23187 and zymosan and 2) the analgesic properties of manoalide seem to be partially correlated with reduced eicosanoid production in zymosan-stimulated mouse peritoneal exudates.\r"

  ".W": "Rats were trained to discriminate pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, an anxiogenic drug), 20.0 mg/kg, from saline using a food-maintained two-lever-choice task. When treated chronically with diazepam (DZP) and tested with the benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, withdrawal from DZP produced a PTZ-like stimulus in these subjects that was related directly to the dose of DZP given every 8 hr for 6 days. In contrast, only the highest dose of DZP (80 mg/kg/8 hr) given chronically produced even minimal physical signs of precipitated abstinence after Ro 15-1788. In a separate experiment, Ro 15-1788 produced a PTZ-like stimulus when given at 2-day intervals during chronic administration of DZP. In this experiment, rats were maintained on DZP, 40.0 mg/kg/6 hr for 14 days. These subjects were tested with Ro 15-1788, 40.0 mg/kg, every 2 days during days 6 through 14 of chronic DZP, and Ro 15-1788 substituted for PTZ on 4 of these 5 tests. Because these experiments involved periods of nontraining on the discrimination task, a final experiment was performed to test the stability of stimulus control in rats trained to detect PTZ. DZP was administered for up to 20 days, withdrawal was precipitated by Ro 15-1788 and after an additional 16 to 40 days of nontraining, stimulus control was tested. There was no significant decline in stimulus control over this period. These results suggest that PTZ discrimination provides a sensitive, stable assay for the detection of withdrawal from benzodiazepine dependence.\r"

Rats were given i.v. infusions of diazepam to onset of loss of righting reflex. Samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood (for serum) and brain were obtained at that time and were analyzed for diazepam and its active metabolites. Based on the results of six experiments on groups of 6 to 14 rats performed at the same time of day over 11 months, the pharmacologic response of the animals was found to be relatively consistent, with little variation between rats and between experiments in body weight-normalized effective dose and in diazepam serum and CSF concentrations. All three active metabolites of diazepam were found in serum, CSF and brain; they were relatively more prominent in CSF than in serum. Variation of the diazepam infusion rate (four rates between 0.10 and 0.34 mg/min per approximately 200-g rat) was associated with changes in average onset time (50 to 10 min) and dose (26 to 17 mg/kg) required to produce the pharmacologic effect. The drug and metabolite concentrations in CSF determined in these experiments, together with corresponding concentrations obtained by infusion of each active metabolite individually, yielded estimates of their relative hypnotic potency that were unaffected by differences in serum protein binding and tissue distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the intervals when the catheters are not being used for infusions, it is customary to maintain patency of the catheter lumen with a solution containing heparin. We show that heparin does not inhibit the growth of S. epidermidis isolated from the catheter of an infected patient. A 20-mg/ml solution of disodium EDTA, a chelating agent which effectively anticoagulates blood at this concentration, was shown to be bactericidal for an initial inoculum of 10(3) CFU of staphylococci per ml in 24 h. Vancomycin, an antibiotic which is often employed to treat Staphylococcus infections, was also bactericidal for initial inocula of 10(3) CFU/ml at doses of 6.7 micrograms/ml, a drug concentration in the therapeutic range. When 10(3) staphylococci per ml were cultured in the presence of catheter segments and disodium EDTA or vancomycin, subcultures of the catheters showed minimal or no growth, respectively. In contrast, when cultured with heparin alone, subcultures showed abundant growth. In view of its low cost, effectiveness as an anticoagulant, and bactericidal activity, EDTA should be studied as a replacement for heparin solutions for the maintenance of intravenous catheters in granulocytopenic patients.\r"

  ".W": "1. To explore the role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in the response to an acute saline load, we compared plasma hormone and urinary electrolyte interrelationships during administration of ANF and saline. Plasma concentrations of ANF, renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone, together with urine volume and electrolytes, were measured during infusions of placebo, ANF [alpha-human ANF (99-126)] and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution in normal subjects under standardized conditions of diet and posture. 2. Saline loading and ANF infusions initially induced similar natriuresis and suppression of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity in association with markedly disparate values of plasma ANF. Plasma ANF levels rose to two- and eight-fold placebo values with saline and ANF, respectively (P less than 0.001). Conversely, in the period after infusion plasma ANF values were similar while natriuresis differed significantly. Peak natriuresis lagged behind peak plasma ANF values with both stimuli. 3. ANF, but not saline, enhanced urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium. Saline, but not ANF, caused increased kaliuresis. 4. The data suggest that ANF makes only a minor contribution to natriuresis induced by saline challenge, although full confirmation of this point requires quantification of end-organ responses to endogenous ANF in the face of changing arterial pressure and circulating volume.\r"
