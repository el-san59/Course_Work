  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that the initiating mechanism is a major determinant of the response to calcium (Ca) accumulation in myocardium. Cultured neonatal rat ventriculocytes were exposed to Na+, K+ pump inhibition with 1 mM ouabain and metabolic inhibition with 20 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 1 mM cyanide (DOG-CN) for up to 2 h. Microspectrofluorometry of myocytes loaded with fura-2 showed that ouabain resulted in a relatively rapid increase in [Ca2+]i up to 2-3 microM (two to threefold above peak systolic level) and that DOG-CN produced an initial decrease and then a relatively slow increase in [Ca2+]i up to peak systolic level. Electron probe x-ray microanalysis (EPMA) showed prominent increases in Na and Ca and decreases in K and Mg in cytoplasm and mitochondria with both interventions, although the increases in Ca were greater with ouabain than DOG-CN. ATP was reduced by 58% after 1 and 2 h of ouabain and by 70 and 90% after 1 and 2 h of DOG-CN, respectively. Thus, ouabain produced greater calcium accumulation and less ATP reduction than DOG-CN. Upon return to normal medium for 30 min, myocytes showed recovery of most electrolyte alterations and resumption of normal Ca2+ transients after 1 h exposure to either ouabain or DOG-CN; however, recovery was less after 2 h of either treatment, with elevated [Ca2+]i maintained in many myocytes. We conclude that the severity of myocyte injury is influenced by the magnitude and duration of both ATP reduction and calcium accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular genetic basis of C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) deficiency in a patient with type I hereditary angioneurotic edema was studied. This patient was found to have an abnormally short C1 INH mRNA together with a normal message. Restriction fragment length polymorphism of the C1 INH gene was detected by Southern blot analysis of the patient's DNA after digestion with Pst I or Sac I, and hybridization with a full-length C1 INH cDNA. Hybridization of the same blot with three different fragments of the full-length cDNA suggested that exon VII and portions of both flanking introns were deleted in the C1 INH gene. Northern blot analysis of RNA from cultured monocytes, using a probe corresponding to exon VII, also indicated that the abnormal C1 INH mRNA had a deletion of these nucleotides. To confirm the hypothesis that the short C1 INH mRNA contained a deletion, the involved segment of the patient's C1 INH mRNA was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR amplification yielded two C1 INH DNA fragments of different lengths (380 and 160 bp). Southern blot and sequence analysis of both DNA fragments clearly revealed that the smaller 160-bp DNA was derived from the abnormal message and had a deletion of nucleotides corresponding to exon VII.\r"

RNAs extracted from HEp-2 cells infected with strains to be analyzed were hybridized with a 32P-labeled RNA probe corresponding to the RS virus G glycoprotein (A2 strain). Areas of nonhomology were detected by cleavage with ribonuclease A. Using this technique, multiple distinct RNA cleavage patterns could be distinguished among viral isolates recovered from infants residing in the same metropolitan area and infected during the same epidemic season. Epidemiologically related isolates (from coinfected twins, from infants infected during a nosocomial outbreak at an extended care facility, and from institutionalized adults infected during an outbreak) yielded identical patterns. In two separate outbreaks, differences in cleavage patterns among certain isolates corresponded to epidemiologically significant differences among the individuals from whom the isolates were recovered. We conclude that substantial genomic heterogeneity exists among circulating isolates of subgroup A RS virus. Ribonuclease protection can be used as a molecular fingerprinting tool for expanded studies of the molecular epidemiology of this virus.\r"

  ".U": "89255946\r", 
  ".W": "Because 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) has been shown to play roles in both proliferation and differentiation of novel target cells, the potential expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) activity was investigated in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Receptor binding assays performed on nuclear extracts of BAEC revealed a single class of specific, high-affinity VDR that displayed a 4.5-fold increase in maximal ligand binding (Nmax) in rapidly proliferating BAEC compared with confluent, density-arrested cells. When confluent BAEC were incubated with activators of protein kinase C (PKC), Nmax increased 2.5-fold within 6-24 h and this upregulation was prevented by sphingosine, an inhibitor of PKC, as well as by actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Immunohistochemical visualization using a specific MAb disclosed nuclear localized VDR in venular and capillary endothelial cells of human skin biopsies, documenting the expression of VDR, in vivo, and validating the BAEC model. Finally, additional experiments indicated that BAEC formed the 1,25(OH)2D3 hormonal metabolite from 25(OH)D3 substrate, in vitro, and growth curves of BAEC maintained in the presence of 10(-8) M 1,25(OH)2D3 showed a 36% decrease in saturation density. These data provide evidence for the presence of a vitamin D microendocrine system in endothelial cells, consisting of the VDR and a 1 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme capable of producing 1,25(OH)2D3. That both components of this system are coordinately regulated, and that BAEC respond to the 1,25(OH)2D3 hormone by modulating growth kinetics, suggests the existence of a vitamin D autocrine loop in endothelium that may play a role in the development and/or functions of this pathophysiologically significant cell population.\r"

This study was intended to determine whether FDP modify PMN functions critical to their bactericidal activity. Incubation of human PMN and Escherichia coli with 50-100 micrograms/ml FDP did not affect phagocytosis, but reduced by greater than 90% the cells' ability to inhibit bacterial colony growth compared with control PMN incubated with albumin or fibrinogen. FDP (10-100 micrograms/ml) inhibited PMN O2- release and chemotaxis stimulated by FMLP by 17-50% (P less than 0.005) and 41% (P less than 0.01), respectively. Fragment E3, and not fragment D1, was primarily responsible for inhibition of FMLP-induced PMN O2- release. Phorbol myristate acetate (10 ng/ml), 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (10(-6) M), AA (4.2 x 10(-5) M), and zymosan-activated serum-stimulated PMN O2- release were also decreased 37-63% by FDP compared with control protein. There are at least two mechanisms by which FDP may impair PMN responses. With respect to FMLP, FDP (16-100 micrograms/ml) inhibited specific binding to the cell surface over a ligand concentration range of 1.4-85 nM [3H]FMLP. In contrast, FDP did not effect the extent of phorbol ester binding to PMN but blocked activation of protein kinase C. These data suggest that elevated plasma FDP inhibit several PMN functions critical to the bactericidal role of these inflammatory cells.\r"

Media from cells of 8 of 13 subjects contained significantly higher mitogenic activity when grown in the presence of 17-beta-estradiol. 17-Alpha-estradiol was not effective. The bioassay system involved rat perirenal preadipocytes, since these have been well characterized. Partial purification by gel filtration chromatography indicated that the estrogen-dependent factors had Mr greater than 250,000 and approximately 30,000. Thus, estrogens might contribute to the development of massive obesity in genetically susceptible subjects by promoting the production of paracrine/autocrine principles by adipose cells.\r"

The effect of bisphosphonates on the formation of osteoclasts from their mononuclear hematopoietic precursors was investigated using human long-term marrow cultures in which multinucleated cells form that express most of the known features of the osteoclast phenotype (e.g., bone resorption, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, calcitonin responsiveness, and reactivity with specific MAbs). The five bisphosphonates that were tested strongly inhibited 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-stimulated formation of these cells with the same relative potencies as they inhibit bone resorption in vivo. Two representative compounds (3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate and dichloromethylene bisphosphonate) failed to inhibit the proliferation of precursors of the osteoclast-like cells. However, these compounds decreased the proportion of mononuclear and multinucleated cells expressing an osteoclast antigen, thus suggesting a degree of specificity for cells of the osteoclast lineage. We conclude that bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-like cell formation in long-term human marrow cultures, and that this may be related to their ability to inhibit bone resorption in vivo.\r"

Furthermore, renal angiotensinogen mRNA level in the adult female WKY rat is considerably lower than in the male. The present study investigates the role of androgen in differential renal ang-n mRNA expression. Northern and slot blot analyses with alpha-32P labeled ang-n cDNA (pRang 3) demonstrated that castration lowered ang-n mRNA levels in the male kidney by greater than or equal to 60% compared with control, suggesting that androgen may be involved with renal ang-n gene regulation. Moreover, male WKY rats castrated as weanlings and normal adult female WKY rats each implanted with testosterone displayed significant (P less than 0.05) increases in renal ang-n mRNA levels. Our observations, taken together with previous reports that androgen influences proximal tubule morphology and the tubular expression of transport proteins (e.g., Na+/H+ antiporter), may have important physiological implications for understanding the relationship between androgen and angiotensin in the regulation of tubular function.\r"

During cardiac catheterization quantitative coronary angiography was performed in 21 patients during supine bicycle exercise. 21 of 28 smooth, angiographically normal vessel segments dilated (14.0 +/- 1.8%) during exercise; four smooth segments did not change whereas only three constricted. In contrast, 15 of 16 vessel segments with irregularities constricted in response to exercise (17.0 +/- 0.1%) with only one segment dilating. All 10 stenotic segments constricted to exercise (23 +/- 4%). Six patients also received intracoronary acetylcholine before exercise to test endothelium-dependent dilator function. In five of six patients all nine vessel segments showed the same directional response to acetylcholine and exercise. Three irregular and two stenotic segments constricted with acetylcholine (51 +/- 21%) and exercise (9.0 +/- 0.6%). In contrast, four smooth segments dilated to acetylcholine (19 +/- 6%) and exercise (9 +/- 1%). Both exercise and acetylcholine generally dilated smooth but constricted irregular and stenosed coronary segments. It appears likely that atherosclerosis plays an important role in the abnormal vasomotion of diseased coronary arteries during exercise and the pattern of abnormality suggests impairment of vasodilator function.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the role of intracellular and extracellular calcium on the ability of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to migrate chemotactically and reexpress (or recycle) formyl peptide receptors when challenged with the synthetic chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). Extracellular calcium was not required for either optimal chemotactic responses or receptor reexpression. Depletion and chelation of intracellular calcium resulted in significant diminution in the ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to release the specific granule constituents lactoferrin and vitamin B12-binding protein during the process of chemotaxis, but had no effect on the capability of these cells to respond chemotactically. Similarly, chelation of intracellular calcium did not affect the ability of these cells to reexpress a population of formyl peptide receptors. Inhibition of receptor reexpression, by a nonagglutinating derivative of wheat-germ agglutinin, was associated with inhibition of chemotactic responses to FMLP. Thus, it appears that large changes in cytosolic free calcium are not necessary for formyl peptide-induced polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis. In contrast, continuous reexpression (or recycling) of formyl peptide receptors is required for polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotactic responses to FMLP, a process that appears to be independent from specific granule fusion with plasma membrane.\r"

Five of 463 cases of childhood ALL with adequately banded leukemic cells were found to have two cytogenetically independent cell populations. In addition, two of the four cases tested had more than two rearranged immunoglobulin genes and (or) T cell receptor genes. To investigate the clonality of these unusual leukemias, we examined the neoplastic cells for X-linked markers extrinsic to the disease. Leukemic cells from each of the three patients heterozygous for an X-linked, restriction fragment length polymorphism showed a single active parental allele, suggesting that both apparently independent cell populations developed from a common progenitor. These cases provide evidence that leukemogenesis involves a multistep process of mutation and suggest that karyotypic abnormalities may be a late event of malignant transformation.\r"

Although the pattern of expression of the adjacent normal growth hormone (hGH-N) and chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) genes in this cluster are well characterized, the expression of the hGH-V gene remains to be defined. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the hGH-V gene is transcribed in the term placenta and expressed as two alternatively spliced mRNAs: one is predicted to encode a 22-kD hormone (hGH-V), the other retains intron 4 in its sequence resulting in the predicted synthesis of a novel 26-kD hGH-V-related protein (hGH-V2). In the present report, we document the expression of both of these hGH-V mRNA species in the villi of the term placenta, demonstrate an increase in their concentrations during gestation, and directly sublocalize hGH-V gene expression to the syncytiotrophoblastic epithelium of the term placenta by in situ cDNA-mRNA histohybridization. The demonstrated similarity in the developmental and tissue-specific expression of the hGH-V gene with that of the related hCS gene suggests that these two genes may share common regulatory elements.\r"

The incubation of normolipidemic plasma led to transfer of CE from HDL to VLDL, and of triglycerides from VLDL to LDL and HDL. This net mass transfer of neutral lipids between the lipoproteins was eliminated by the monoclonal antibody. However, CE transfer inhibition had no effect on the rate of plasma cholesterol esterification in plasma incubated from 10 min to 24 h at 37 degrees C. In the absence of CE transfer, HDL and LDL exhibited cholesterol esterification activity, whereas VLDL did not. The rate of CE formation in HDL was three to four times greater than in LDL during the first hour of incubation, but CE formation in HDL decreased after 6-8 h, while that in LDL continued. Thus, (a) the Mr 74,000 CETP is responsible for all neutral lipid mass transfer in incubated human plasma, (b) the rate of CE formation in plasma is not regulated by CE transfer from HDL to other lipoproteins, and (c) HDL is the major initial substrate for LCAT; LDL assumes a more significant role only after prolonged incubation of plasma.\r"

We recently found two parathyroid adenomas bearing clonal restriction fragment abnormalities involving the PTH locus, and now show that in one of these tumors: (a) a DNA rearrangement occurred at the PTH locus; (b) the rearrangement separated the PTH gene's 5' flanking region from its coding exons, conceivably placing a newly adjacent gene under the influence of PTH regulatory elements; (c) the DNA that recombined with PTH normally maps to 11q13, the known chromosomal location of several oncogenes and the gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia type I; and (d) the rearrangement was a reciprocal, conservative recombination of the locus on 11q13 (Human Gene Mapping Library assignment D11S287) with PTH (on 11p15). These data provide molecular cytogenetic evidence for the clonal occurrence of a major chromosome 11 aberrancy in this benign parathyroid tumor. The D11S287 clone could prove useful in genetic linkage analyses, in determining precise 11q13 breakpoints in other neoplasms, and in identifying a gene on chromosome 11 that may participate in parathyroid tumor development.\r"

  ".W": "The role of charged sites on the permeability characteristics of the pulmonary microvascular barrier were investigated using chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep. In one series of experiments we studied the effects of the cationic amphiphile, dodecyl trimethylamine (DTA; 297 mol wt), and the anionic amphiphile, SDS (288 mol wt), on lung lymph flow rates (Ql), lung lymph to plasma protein ratios (L/P), pulmonary hemodynamics, and systemic hemodynamics. DTA significantly increased both Ql and L/P, whereas SDS had a more modest and transient effect on these variables. In a second series of experiments the polycations polybrene and poly-l-lysine were found to have very similar effects as those of DTA. In another series of experiments we tested the pretreatment inhibition potential of chlorpheniramine (an H1 receptor antagonist), dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP), and the calcium channel antagonists verapamil and nifedipine on polybrene-induced lung injury. We found that only verapamil and db-cAMP significantly attenuated the permeability effects of polybrene. We conclude that both cationic amphiphiles and polycations cause hemodynamic and permeability alterations in the pulmonary circulation of unanesthetized sheep. In addition, the permeability alterations induced by polybrene can be modulated by intracellular calcium and/or cAMP levels.\r"

Further analysis demonstrated that the chromosome bearing this gene conversion has a very high frequency among Bantu chromosomes and a very low or nil frequency in other haplotypes linked to the beta s gene. No correlation was found between the G gamma/A gamma ratio and the presence of the gene conversion among Bantu haplotype patients, thus excluding a portion of the gamma gene sequence in the determination of this ratio.\r"

Here, we present an experimental procedure for collecting suprapituitary blood in man. To solve the question on the origin of such blood we investigated specific markers of hypothalamic secretory activity: the catecholamines (CAs). We found (a) norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and epinephrine (E) concentrations from approximately 1.5 to 2.5, 3.5 to 4.5, and 6- to 10-fold higher, respectively, in suprapituitary than peripheral blood, (b) different NE/DA and NE/E ratios in favor of DA and E in suprapituitary blood, and (c), a complete (100%) group separation (suprapituitary vs. peripheral) when discriminant analysis included only DA and E. These data indicate that suprapituitary blood composition is different from that of the peripheral blood, and is particularly rich in CAs and claimed differences between DA and E release on one hand and NE release on the other in suprapituitary blood also are observed. We advance the hypothesis of a hypothalamic source of such amines draining via median eminence into portal vasculature, and name this blood \"hypothalamic-hypophysial blood.\" Besides serving as \"classical\" neurotransmitters, CAs may also have a direct neurohormonal role in the regulation of the human hypothalamic-hypophysial function.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated three actions of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] in human skin fibroblasts to test for heterogeneity in hormone-response coupling. In fibroblasts from normal subjects the 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentrations for half-maximal effect (EC50) were: for mitogenic effect 0.0001-0.0005 nM, for antimitogenic effect 1 nM, and for induction of 25-OHD3 24-hydroxylase (24-OHase) 5 nM. To evaluate the effects of mutations presumed to be in the gene for the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor we examined cell lines representing four kindreds with hereditary resistance to 1,25-(OH)2D3 (\"mutant\" cell lines). In one mutant cell line all three 1,25-(OH)2D3 actions were severely abnormal. In one mutant cell line 24-OHase induction and mitogenic action were undetectable, but EC50 and maximal effect were normal for antimitogenic action of 1,25-(OH)2D3. In two mutant cell lines 24-OHase induction and antimitogenic actions were undetectable or severely impaired but mitogenic action were undetectable or severely impaired but mitogenic action was normal in EC50 and normal or increased in maximal effect. The mitogenic and antimitogenic actions in normal cells showed a similar profile of potency ratios for 1,25-(OH)2D3 and six analogues. Whenever a mutant cell showed a normal or even an abnormal mitogenic or antimitogenic effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3, these effects showed potency ratios similar to wild type, suggesting mediation by a similar 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor. We conclude that three 1,25-(OH)2D3 actions show important differences in hormone response coupling indicated by differences in EC50 for 1,25-(OH)2D3 and by different consequences of receptor mutations.\r"

  ".W": "The dynamic response of squared conduction velocity, theta 2, to repetitive stimulation in canine Purkinje fibers with quinidine was studied using a double-microelectrode technique. With stimulation, a frequency-dependent monoexponential increase in conduction delay (CD) and a decline in theta 2 were observed. The exponential rates and changes in steady-state CD and theta 2 were frequency- and concentration-dependent. The overall drug uptake rates describing blockade and the interpulse recovery interval were linearly related and steady-state values of theta 2 were linearly related to an exponential function of the stimulus intervals. Based on first-order binding, the frequency- and concentration-dependent properties of quinidine were characterized by the apparent binding and unbinding rates of 14.2 +/- 5.7 X 10(6) mol-1.s-1 and 63 +/- 12 s-1 for activated and 14.8 +/- 1.0 X 10(2) mol-1.s-1 and 0.16 +/- 0.03 s-1 for resting states. The recovery time constant extracted from the pulse train interpulse interval was 5.8 +/- 1.5 s compared with 5.1 +/- 0.6 s determined from a posttrain test pulse protocol. This study demonstrates that the kinetics of drug action can be derived from measures of impulse propagation. This provides a basis for characterizing frequency-dependent properties of antiarrhythmic agents in vivo and suggests the plausibility of a quantitative assessment of drug binding and recovery rates in man.\r"

  ".U": "89255974\r", 
  ".W": "A deletion involving chromosome 3p (14-23) characteristically occurs in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Reduction to homozygosity, rather than complete loss, is typically observed for genes in the deleted region. Lack of expression for genes encoded by this region, implying inactivation of all alleles, has not been previously described. We have examined the expression of aminoacylase-1 (ACY-1), encoded by chromosome 3p21, using both an electrophoretic activity assay and a monoclonal antibody-based ELISA. A variety of human tissues, including lung, brain, liver, kidney, heart, adrenal medulla, and erythrocytes have previously been tested for ACY-1 activity and antigen; all but erythrocytes are positive. Thus, ACY-1 is expressed in all nucleated human cells examined to date. ACY-1 was undetectable in a significant number of SCLC cell lines (4/29) and tumors (1/8), but not in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (0/19) or tumors (0/9), nor in a variety of other human cell lines (0/15) or colon tumors (0/8). In addition, reduced (approximately 10% of normal) ACY-1 expression was common in SCLC cell lines (14/29) and tumors (3/8), but not in NSCLC cell lines (1/19) or tumors (0/9), nor in other human cell lines (0/15) or colon tumors (0/8). Thus, low or undetectable ACY-1 expression is highly specific for SCLC and occurs in both cell lines and tumor tissue. The finding of undetectable ACY-1 expression in SCLC supports the hypothesis that inactivation of all alleles of specific chromosome 3p genes occurs in a SCLC in a fashion analogous to Rb gene inactivation in retinoblastoma, and suggests that the structural gene for ACY-1 may be closely linked to a putative SCLC tumor suppressor gene.\r"

Plasma cholesterol levels remained reduced for 4-8 h after the administration of apo E. Furthermore, the intravenous injection of apo E reduced the plasma cholesterol levels in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. The addition of apo E to [14C]cholesterol-labeled canine thoracic duct lymph or [14C]cholesterol-labeled chylomicrons resulted in accelerated plasma clearance of these diet-induced lipoproteins in normal rabbits, with the uptake occurring primarily in the liver. This study suggests that the amount or availability of apo E in the plasma of cholesterol-fed rabbits may be rate limiting for the normal clearance of diet-induced remnant lipoproteins.\r"

To test this hypothesis, 24 patients who received intravenous streptokinase therapy within 4 h of chest pain were studied prospectively. All patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography at the time of admission and 1, 2, 3 and 10 days later. The patients also underwent coronary angiography 2 h after completion of streptokinase therapy. Although 18 (75%) of the 24 patients had a patent infarct-related artery, only 8 (45%) of the 18 patients with this finding showed improvement in regional function. Improvement was not evident until 3 to 10 days after streptokinase therapy. In addition to the presence of an open infarct-related artery, the interval between chest pain and onset of streptokinase therapy (2.5 +/- 0.5 versus 3.2 +/- 0.7 h, p = 0.02) differed significantly between patients who did or did not show improved regional function. Of the 15 of 16 patients with no improvement in regional function, 4 showed infarct expansion, and all had a closed infarct-related artery compared with only 2 of the 11 not showing expansion (p = 0.01). In conclusion, intravenous streptokinase given within 4 h of chest pain results in improvement in regional function in about 33% of the patients, presumably by arresting the infarction within the endocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty left ventricular thrombi were diagnosed in these 92 patients. The cumulative percent of identified thrombus in each echocardiographic examination in the surviving patients was 27% at less than 24 h; 57% at 48 to 72 h; 75% at 1 week and 96% at 2 weeks. The thrombus shape was defined as mural in 53% and protruding in 47% of patients. Systemic embolism (stroke) was noted during hospitalization in two patients with a protruding thrombus. At 12 weeks of follow-up, patients with thrombus had poorer (and almost unchanged from baseline) global left ventricular function as expressed by wall motion score compared with that of patients without thrombus, who exhibited significant improvement. Global left ventricular wall motion in patients with persisting or resolved thrombus was similar during follow-up. Apical wall motion worsened in 70% of the patients with persisting thrombus and in 25% of the patients with resolved thrombus (p less than 0.1). In the 22 surviving patients with thrombus, resolution or change in thrombus shape or size was noted in 14 of the 15 patients receiving anticoagulant therapy and in 4 of the 7 untreated patients. Six of the 18 patients with an early- (48 to 72 h) and none of the 12 patients with a later-formed thrombus died. Maximal serum enzyme levels, percent with Killip functional class III to IV and left ventricular wall motion score were higher in the patients with an early- than in those with a later-formed thrombus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-three patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy underwent hemodynamic assessment during symptom-limited maximal exercise with objective measurement of exercise capacity by respiratory gas analysis. Maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold were 28.1 +/- 7.5 and 21.5 +/- 6.1 ml/kg per min, respectively (the lower limit of reference range in our laboratory is 39 and 27 ml/kg per min, respectively). Maximal oxygen consumption was reduced in 11 of 13 patients who were in New York Heart Association functional class I and who denied limitation of exercise capacity and in all 10 patients who were in functional class II or III. Maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold were related to peak cardiac index (r = 0.650, p less than 0.001 and r = 0.459, p = 0.03, respectively) and to the increase in cardiac index on exercise (r = 0.677, p less than 0.001 and r = 0.509, p = 0.016, respectively), but not to cardiac index at rest, peak and rest pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at an oxygen consumption of 15 ml/kg per min or the rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on exercise. These findings are not consistent with the hypothesis that elevated left atrial pressure is the major determinant of exercise capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and they suggest that, as in patients with chronic cardiac failure, other mechanisms should be considered.\r"

The length of the occluded segments varied between 0.5 and 26.0 cm, but 67% of the occlusions were greater than 9 cm long. The initial success rate was 67%. Arterial perforation occurred in six patients but was not associated with major complications. To study the mechanism of the laser-mediated thermal probe, thermal recanalization was performed on 11 human arterial segments in vitro obtained after amputation, and mechanical recanalization was performed in vitro in 10 human peripheral arteries with use of a guide wire and catheter technique. An additional four arteries were studied with the laser probe as a non-heated mechanical device. Both the mechanical and thermal devices appear to follow a similar pathway through a complete obstruction. These studies suggest that the thermal probe burns through soft fibrous tissue but is mechanically deflected away from hard fibrocalcific plaque. The probe then advances along the plane between the intimal plaque and the media for a variable length before perforating through the adventitia. These observations suggest that the major mechanism of thermal probe recanalization may be a mechanical process. It appears that thermal probe devices do not inherently seek the true lumen of an occluded artery and that better guidance systems need to be developed.\r"

The coronary artery fistula drained into the right atrium in 4 patients, the right ventricle in 2 and the pulmonary artery in 10. The dilated coronary artery was visualized in 7 of the 16 patients with a fistula, as compared with none of the 40 control subjects. These 7 patients included 5 of 6 patients with a fistula draining into the right atrium or right ventricle and only 2 of 10 patients with a fistula draining into the pulmonary artery. Abnormal flow signals in the dilated coronary artery were visualized with Doppler color flow mapping in five of these seven patients. Color flow imaging visualized abnormal flow signals with mosaic appearance in the pulmonary artery in eight patients, the right atrium in four and the right ventricle in two. The chamber in which abnormal signals were detected corresponded with the entry site of the fistula by angiography. Intraoperative imaging during surgical repair was needed in two cases to confirm ligation of all arteries feeding into the fistula network. In conclusion, Doppler color flow imaging is diagnostically useful to visualize shunt flows originating from the opening or exit of a coronary artery fistula. Furthermore, intraoperative use of this technique may provide confirmation of successful surgical ligation of the fistula.\r"

The effect of age at surgery on right ventricular performance in these patients was also studied. Pulsed Doppler velocity profiles of aortic blood flow were analyzed at a mean age of 5.5 years in 24 patients who had undergone intraatrial repair of aortopulmonary transposition either in early infancy (mean age 3.4 +/- 1.3 weeks) or later (mean age 8.5 +/- 6.5 months). Velocity and acceleration variables in these patients were compared with the same variables in 24 age-matched normal subjects and with the performance of their own right ventricle as assessed by two-dimensional echocardiographic measurement of ejection fraction. The 12 patients who underwent early repair had a higher ejection fraction than did the 12 who underwent later repair (mean +/- SD 0.60 +/- 0.07 versus 0.42 +/- 0.10; p less than 0.001). Aortic flow velocity was similar in all patients. Aortic acceleration was normal in patients after early intraatrial repair of aortopulmonary transposition (20.8 +/- 2.3 m/s2), but was abnormally slow in patients after late repair (11.1 +/- 1.8 m/s2; p less than 0.001), thus suggesting that the latter group had diminished right ventricular performance. Concomitantly, acceleration time and ratio of acceleration time to ejection time were increased in patients after late repair.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These data suggest that excessive chromosomal material (as in trisomies) may result in situs solitus at all levels. The malformations of the atrioventricular and semilunar valves were characterized by redundant or thick myxomatous leaflets, long chordae tendineae and hypoplastic or absent papillary muscles. The ventricular septal defect was associated with anterosuperior conal septal malalignment in 25 cases (61%). On the basis of the characteristic valvular lesions, the type of ventricular septal defect and the absence of transposition or inversions, two-dimensional echocardiographic diagnosis of trisomy-18 in the fetus may become possible.\r"

The purpose of this prospective study was to assess whether mode of ventricular tachycardia induction is more reproducible within one study than from day to day. Thirty-nine consecutive patients with documented sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias secondary to coronary artery disease underwent three inductions of ventricular tachycardia at 15 min intervals in the absence of drug therapy. A stimulation protocol in which the only major variable was the number of extrastimuli required for tachycardia induction was used. Subsequent day to day variability in mode of tachycardia induction was also assessed in the same patients at two further drug-free inductions at intervals of 5 +/- 2 days. The number of extrastimuli required for tachycardia induction was significantly more reproducible at the immediate repeat studies than from day to day (69% of patients versus 31%, p less than 0.01). From these data, probability tables were derived that show the likelihood that changes in inducibility at subsequent tachycardia inductions are due to chance. The QRS configuration of induced ventricular tachycardia was also more reproducible at the immediate studies (64% versus 26%, p less than 0.01). Basic electrophysiologic and stimulation variables differed over a significantly wider range from day to day than at the immediate studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-six of the patients had coronary artery disease and were studied to evaluate map-guided surgery for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Burst ventricular pacing and up to three ventricular extrastimuli coupled to two drive train cycle lengths were delivered from the right and left ventricular epicardial wire electrodes and from endocardial catheter electrodes placed at the apex and outflow tract of the right ventricle. Ventricular tachycardia was reproducibly induced in three patients by both endocardial and epicardial stimulation. In one patient ventricular tachycardia was reproducibly induced by epicardial stimulation, but nonreproducible, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was induced by endocardial stimulation. Ventricular tachycardia remained inducible by both endocardial and epicardial stimulation in three instances (two patients) during drug therapy. A negative study (less than 10 consecutive ventricular beats induced) was obtained in 23 patients by both endocardial and epicardial stimulation. The patients were followed up for 12 to 43 months (average 31). Sudden death or documented ventricular tachycardia occurred in two of the three patients with a positive study by both endocardial and epicardial stimulation. Nineteen (83%) of the 23 patients with concordantly negative studies remained free of arrhythmias. On the basis of concordant results of endocardial and epicardial stimulation (p = 0.001) these results suggest that epicardial stimulation of the right and the left ventricle is an acceptable method to assess the postoperative inducibility of ventricular tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forward stroke volume and cardiac output were determined in each mode at each AV interval from the left ventricular outflow tract flow velocities, and the percent increase in cardiac output over VVI mode was determined. M-mode measurements, including left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, shortening fraction and left atrial size and Doppler measurement of diastolic filling, including peak early velocity and percent atrial contribution, did not correlate with the percent increase in cardiac output during physiologic pacing. The stroke volume in VVI mode correlated significantly with the percent increase in cardiac output during physiologic pacing (r = -0.61, p less than 0.005 for VDD mode and r = -0.55, p less than 0.05 for DVI mode).

SHU-508 is a new saccharide echo contrast agent that produces bubble sizes from 2 to 8 microns in diameter, capable of traversing the pulmonary capillary bed and resulting in left heart contrast. The echo intensity produced by this agent was compared with that of agitated saline solution, indocyanine green and SHU-454 (another experimental saccharide agent for right-sided contrast) during 136 injections in eight dogs. Videotaped two-dimensional echographic images were digitized and analyzed with the use of videodensitometry for peak right and left ventricular intensity, pulmonary transit times and time of persistence of contrast. The highest right ventricular intensity value (3,594 +/- 1,393) was achieved with SHU-508 (p less than 0.05 compared with the other agents). The right ventricular contrast seen with SHU-508 also persisted for a longer period (22.8 +/- 12 s) than with the standard agents (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular contrast with SHU-508 was visually evident in all 42 injections, whereas the peak left ventricular intensity was 35% as bright as that produced in the right ventricle by the same agent. Peak left ventricular intensity values from SHU-508 were compared with those from agitated saline solution injected from the pulmonary capillary wedge position in four dogs. SHU-508 produced brighter left ventricular intensity (1,281 +/- 607) compared with that obtained with the saline-wedge technique (p les than 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether Doppler color flow mapping could be used to quantify changing levels of regurgitant flow and define the technical variables that influence the size of color flow images of regurgitant jets, nine stable hemodynamic states of mitral insufficiency were studied in four open chest sheep with regurgitant orifices of known size. The magnitude of mitral regurgitation was altered by phenylephrine infusion. Several technical variables, including the type of color flow instrument (Irex Aloka 880 versus Toshiba SSH65A), transducer frequency, pulse repetition frequency and gain level, were studied. Significant increases in the color flow area, but not in color jet width measurements, were seen after phenylephrine infusion for each regurgitant orifice. For matched levels of mitral regurgitation, an increase in gain resulted in a 125% increase in color flow area. An increase in the pulse repetition and transducer frequencies resulted in a 36% reduction and a 28% increase in color flow area, respectively. Jet area for matched regurgitant volumes was larger on the Toshiba compared with the Aloka instrument (5.2 +/- 3.1 versus 3.2 +/- 1.2 cm2, p less than 0.05). Color flow imaging of mitral regurgitant jets is dependent on various technical factors and the magnitude of regurgitation. Once these are standardized for a given patient, the measurement of color flow jet area may provide a means of making serial estimates of the severity of mitral insufficiency.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate factors influencing the structure and shape of stenotic and regurgitant jets, Doppler color flow mapping and optical flow visualization studies were performed with use of a syringe model with a constant rate of ejection to simulate jets of valvular regurgitation and a pulsatile flow model of the right heart chambers to simulate jets of mild, moderate and severe valvular pulmonary stenosis. Ink-(0 to 40%) glycerol-water jets (viscosity 1 to 3.5 centiPoise) were produced by injecting the fluid at a constant rate into a 10 gallon rectangular reservoir of the same still fluid through 1.4 and 3.4 mm needles. The Doppler color flow scanners imaged the laminar jet length within 3 mm of actual jet length (2 to 6 cm) and the jet width within 2 to 3 mm of the actual jet width. Jet flows with Reynolds numbers ranging from 230 to 1,200 injected into still fluid yielded jet length/width ratios that decreased with increasing Reynolds numbers and leveled off to a length/width ratio of 5-6:1 at a Reynolds number near 600. When the fluid reservoir was swirled to better mimic the effect of flow entering the same cardiac chamber from a second source, the jets showed diminution of the jet length/width ratio and a clearly defined zone of turbulence. Studies of the pulsatile flow model were performed at cardiac outputs of 1 to 6 liters/min for the normal and each stenotic valve. Mild stenosis had an orifice area of 2.8 cm2, moderate stenosis an area of 1.0 cm2 and severe stenosis an area of 0.5 cm2. Laminar jet length represented the length of the total jet, which had a symmetric width and was measured from the valve opening to a region where the jet exhibited a spray effect. Laminar jet lengths (0.2 to 1.1 cm) were imaged by Doppler color flow mapping and optical visualization only in the moderate and severely stenotic valves and only at flows less than or equal to 3 liters/min (mean Reynolds numbers less than or equal to 3,470). Beyond this flow rate the jets exhibited a spray effect. Laminar jet length/width ratio approached unity with an increased amount of valvular stenosis and higher flow volumes (cardiac output). Proximal aliasing was present in each valve studied. the length of aliasing (0 to 3.2 cm) proximal to the valve was longer with increased flow rates and increased amounts of stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The mothers, selected from a study of pregnancy outcome in 1,080 middle-class women, had early and regular prenatal care. Regression analyses within each initial weight category revealed that there was no relationship between initial weight of mothers and birth weight of their infants, but birth weight increased significantly with antenatal weight gain (p less than .0001). A 1-kg maternal increase in weight was associated with a 12.85-gm increase in birth weight in offspring of underweight women and an 8.59-gm increase in offspring of normal weight women. Underweight women had significantly larger prenatal weight gains (9.3 vs. 8.5 kg), but there were no statistically significant differences in mean birth weight, gestational age, or Apgar scores between infants of women in the two weight groups. Very underweight women (less than 80% MRW) had lower-birth-weight infants, more preterm infants, and more infants with medical complications. Antenatal weight gain accounted for the greatest variation in birth weight among infants of underweight and normal weight women. When underweight mothers gained less than 9 kg, their infants had mean birth weights 361 gm less than the mean birth weights of infants of underweight women who gained more weight.\r"

The present study addresses this issue through retrospective evaluation of 217 women pregnant with twins who delivered at Swedish Hospital Medical Center, Seattle, between 1982 and 1986. The purpose of the study was to identify an optimum total weight gain and an optimum weight gain pattern for normal twin gestation. A mean prenatal weight gain of 20 kg (44 lb) was associated with \"optimum\" outcome; optimum outcome was defined as a pregnancy lasting at least 37 weeks with the delivery of two living infants weighing greater than or equal to 2,500 gm each with 5-minute Apgar scores greater than or equal to 7. A weight gain curve for twin gestation was generated and compared with the standard curve for singleton pregnancy. While the weight gain curve during twin gestation was similar to the standard curve during the first half of pregnancy, increased weight gain began in the second trimester and continued to term. The weight gain pattern of twin gestations with less-than-optimum outcome paralleled that of the optimum outcome group until about 30 weeks' gestation, at which time weight gain slowed in women in the former group, whose mean total weight gain was 16.8 kg (37 lb).\r"

This study examines this issue in both lactating and nonlactating women. A random sample of 463 subjects was selected from all prenatal patients receiving care at a large health maintenance organization (HMO). Even though almost all of the subjects reported craving some food or beverage during the last trimester of pregnancy and half reported some aversion, those phenomena dropped markedly in the postpartum period. Evaluation of dietary quality as related to food cravings revealed no clear association; that is, the data provided no evidence to support the hypothesis that cravings are caused by dietary deficiencies or that they result in significantly augmented intake of key nutrients found in those foods. Overall, food cravings and aversions do not continue into the postpartum period at a higher rate than one would expect in the adult female population; manifestation of food cravings/aversions is not related to dietary quality.\r"

The 234 Total Diet Study foods, which are representative of the U.S. food supply, were purchased, prepared for consumption, and analyzed for the elements four times each year. The results were combined with national food consumption data to estimate intakes for 6- to 11-month-old infants, 2-year-old children, 14- to 16-year-old boys and girls, 25- to 30-year-old men and women, and 60- to 65-year-old men and women. Six elements (calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, and manganese) were low (less than 80% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance or below the low end of the Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intake range) for three or more of the age-sex groups. Six elements were of concern for teenage girls and adult women, five for older women, three for 2-year-old children, two for teenage boys and older men, and only one for infants and adult men. Sodium levels (which did not include discretionary salt) were elevated for 2-year-old children and teenage boys, and iodine was elevated for all age-sex groups. A significant trend was noted only for iodine, the intake of which decreased during the 4-year period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three-day averages for total energy, percent protein, percent saturated fat, percent unsaturated fat, percent complex carbohydrates, percent refined carbohydrates, cholesterol, sodium, vitamin C, and iron (measured in milligrams) were computed, and their distributions were compared with the normal (Gaussian) distribution. The distribution of values of sodium for females and, to a lesser extent, cholesterol for females and of cholesterol and vitamin C for males, differed from the normal distribution. The remaining distributions appeared to be reasonably close to normal in shape. It is recommended that nutrition researchers verify the normal distribution assumptions prior to applying parametric techniques to their data and that they use nonparametric (distribution-free) techniques to analyze their data whenever those assumptions are not valid.\r"

The mean proportion of cholesterol from eggs for a group of persons is determined by first calculating the proportion of cholesterol from eggs for each person and then taking an arithmetic mean of all the proportions. The population proportion is calculated by summing the amount of cholesterol from eggs for all persons and then dividing that by the sum of the cholesterol from all foods for all persons. These two different formulas often yield similar results. Sometimes, however, the results can be quite different because of variation in the ratio, variation in the denominator, and/or the correlation between the ratio and the denominator. Each of these formulas is designed to answer a specific question: the mean proportion addresses the question about the average per person and the population proportion addresses the question of population intakes. But because either may be used to answer the same general question, confusion may result. This article discusses the factors influencing differences between the two formulas and the implications of those differences for reporting and interpreting dietary intake data.\r"

However, because microwaving is as effective as holder pasteurization in killing bacteria, and because it would be less expensive and is faster, this process should be further investigated.\r"

The study population included 1,431 children, teenagers, and pregnant and lactating women. A dietary score was developed to be limited if certain targeted subgroups of major food groups were not included. Scores were related to Mean Adequacy Ratios (MARs), truncated indexes of the percent of the Recommended Dietary Allowances for protein, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and vitamin C through the use of correlation/regression analysis. Separate analyses were run for each of nine different population segments. Regression coefficients were used to generate predicted MAR values that were, in turn, used to categorize individuals according to certain cut-off points. Individuals were also categorized by their actual MARs, according to the same cut-off points. These categorizations provided the basis for validating the score. The score correctly classified 69% to 98% of the persons in each population segment. The score was most sensitive for population segments that have a large proportion of persons below a particular cut-off. Just as important, the score was simple to implement, requiring just three steps from assessing the food frequency to determining risk.\r"

In order to address one of the major methodological issues, unobtrusive observations were performed on the lunch meal of 34 children. These children ranged in age from 4.0 to 9.5 years (mean = 5.8 years, standard deviation = 1.6 years). Each child was accompanied by both parents. Dietary recalls were obtained the following day from (a) the mother alone, (b) the father alone, and (c) the mother, father, and child reporting as a group (consensus recall). Recalls were analyzed with nutrition software that yields information on energy, protein, carbohydrate, sugar, total fat, cholesterol, sodium, iron, and calcium. Strong correlations were seen between each recall and the observation (mean r = .86). However, the group accuracy in correctly reporting different types of foods varied from the fathers' under-reporting of breads (-27%) to fathers' over-reporting of fruit (+50%). When regression analyses were used, only the consensus recall resulted in a regression line not significantly different from 1.0 for the majority of the nutrients analyzed. Thus, it appears that the consensus recall produced a better estimate of the observed intake from one meal than did recalls obtained from mother or father.\r"

The results of a Dutch national nutrition survey of food consumption and nutritional status among 539 independently living, apparently healthy elderly persons, aged 65 to 79 years, show that in general the intake of macronutrients deviates from the Dutch recommendations. In particular, saturated fat intake and P:S ratio were unfavorable, especially for the solitary elderly persons (saturated fat intake 19.0 +/- 3.2% and 17.7 +/- 3.3% total energy for men and women, respectively). Except for vitamin B-6 (about 92% of the recommendation on a group level for men and 78% for women), the intake of micronutrients studied is considered to be adequate. Elderly women living alone had a higher calcium:phosphorus ratio (0.76 +/- 0.12), lower meat consumption (90 +/- 31 gm), and a lower mean HDL-cholesterol concentration (1.22 +/- 0.28 mmol/L) in serum than non-solitary elderly women (Ca:P ratio 0.73 +/- 0.12, meat consumption 100 +/- 36 gm, HDL-cholesterol concentration 1.45 +/- 0.38 mmol/L). Potatoes, vegetables, and meat were more often prepared for more than one day at a time by elderly persons living alone than by the non-solitary elderly.\r"

With the use of a structured interview schedule, in-home interviews were conducted by a Hmong or a Cambodian bilingual staff person with the adult having primary responsibility for family meal preparation. Results indicated that while food buying practices have changed drastically in the U.S., Southeast Asian refugee families have maintained strong ties to their native foods and traditional diets. In the U.S., as in Southeast Asia, rice remains the staple food in their diet. High status foods in Cambodia and Laos, such as fruits, meats, and soft drinks, remain highly preferred foods in the U.S. and are consumed frequently. Although most adults prefer eating their native foods, their children prefer both American and native foods. Thirty percent of the adolescents in the home had major responsibility for evening meal preparation.\r"

Food supply and a sample of nutrient intake were computed and calculated per person. Energy, protein, and fat (including cholesterol and saturated fat) consumption in the kibbutzim was higher than the average Israeli intake. Similarly, the cholesterol/saturated fat index was 1.4 and 2.8 times higher in kibbutz A and 1.3 and 2.6 times higher in kibbutz B than the average for the Israeli population and the recommended value, respectively. These findings may explain the high morbidity and mortality related to ischemic heart disease found in the kibbutzim.\r"

Both groups were tested on knowledge of food composition relative to fats and oils. Additionally, restaurateurs responded to questions concerning the need for nutrition education for their personnel. Eighty-eight percent of the 178 patrons expressed an interest in following a heart-healthy diet: 55% maintained that they always or often were motivated by health-related considerations when selecting menu items. The most important characteristics of the menu items (5-point scale, 1 = least important) were reported to be low cholesterol (3.85 +/- 1.01), low saturated fat (3.77 +/- 1.05), low total fat (3.76 +/- 1.03), low sodium (3.69 +/- 1.15), and low calorie (3.57 +/- 1.13). Fifty-seven percent of the patrons were aware of the program, but most of them dined in participating restaurants less than half of the time they dined out. There were no significant differences between the scores of patrons and restaurant personnel regarding knowledge of fat and oil content of foods. The overall mean score for the entire group was 6.09 +/- 3.4 points out of a possible 13 points. Restaurateurs cited nutrition education for waitstaff and assistance in the identification of appropriate menu items as aspects of the program most in need of further development. The major disadvantage of the program cited was potential negative attention drawn to some menu items. Overall, however, restaurateurs concurred that the advantages of participation in the program outweighed the disadvantages. All of them stated that the major advantage of the program was the ease with which a public service could be provided to their patrons while, simultaneously, the image of the restaurant was enhanced.\r"

When mAb directed to polymorphic regions of I-Ak were used as inhibitors of Ag presentation, several different patterns of inhibition were observed among T cells specific for the same HEL peptide as well as among T cells specific for different fragments of HEL. Although there appears to be a conserved usage of some TCR V beta gene segments among the T cell hybrids specific for the same HEL peptide, no correlation is evident between a single V gene usage and susceptibility to blocking of Ag presentation by a particular anti-I-Ak mAb. Several of the mAb demonstrated T cell \"clonotypic blocking\" of Ag presentation, whereas others blocked presentation to every T cell hybrid tested, regardless of the peptide specificity. When mAb directed to nonpolymorphic regions of the I-A molecule were tested for their ability to block Ag presentation, little or no inhibition was observed. In addition, Fab' fragments of inhibitory mAb functioned identically to their intact homologous counterparts in their ability to block Ag presentation indicating that \"nonspecific\" steric hindrance was not playing a major role in the inhibitions observed. When the polymorphic region-directed anti-I-A mAb were tested for their ability to block the direct binding of the lysozyme peptide HEL(46-61) to I-Ak, those mAb that block HEL presentation to all T cell hybrids were found to block the binding of this peptide. However, anti-I-A mAb that demonstrate selective inhibition of T cell hybrid stimulation during Ag presentation, i.e., those directed to polymorphic serologic specificities Ia.15 and Ia.19, do not block the binding of HEL(46-61) to I-Ak. These data indicate that functionally independent epitopes exist on the I-Ak molecule for the binding of antigenic peptides and for interaction with the TCR.\r"

After purification by affinity chromatography, IgA mAb were fractionated into monomers and polymers by gel filtration and radiolabeled with 125I. Mice were injected i.v. with either 125I-monomer and 131I-albumin or 125I-polymer and 161I-albumin. At various times after injection, serum and gut, nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected. The TCA precipitable radioactivities were determined and the selective transport indices calculated. The results indicated selective transport of polymeric IgA but not monomeric IgA from serum into upper respiratory and intestinal secretions. The degree of TCA precipitability in nasal lavage and to a lesser extent gut secretions suggested significant degradation of the antibody during or after transport. To investigate further the integrity of the IgA in mucosal secretions, ELISA viral binding activity of nonradiolabeled IgA was determined for both IgA incubated with nasal secretions in vitro and polymeric IgA recovered by nasal lavage 4 h after i.v. injection. Although reconstitution experiments indicated no significant loss of antibody binding activity after incubation of antibody with lavage fluid in vitro, only negligible ELISA binding activity was detected in nasal washes after i.v. injection of antibody. The data overall suggest that although there is a quantitatively small, but selective transport of polymeric IgA into the upper respiratory tract, this transport results in minimal functional antibody activity. Implications of these and other findings for strategies of oral immunization in prophylaxis against respiratory infections are discussed.\r"

In the present study we determined whether pretreatment with PGE2 could desensitize the suppressive function of PGE2 for the production of macrophage (MO)-derived TNF. CFA-elicited MO were incubated with PGE2 or medium only, washed, and then challenged with graded doses of LPS (0.001 to 1000 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of new PGE2. The concomitant addition of PGE2 with LPS shifted the LPS concentration-effect curve 16-fold to the right with a 52% decrease in the maximum LPS response, while MO pretreated with PGE2, washed, and incubated with LPS plus new PGE2 were desensitized to TNF regulation. These latter conditions resulted in a complete loss of the ability of PGE2 to inhibit MO TNF production as demonstrated by no significant change in the EC50 of LPS. In addition, the PGE2 concentration effect curve was shifted to the right after pretreatment of MO, suggesting a desensitized PGE2 receptor system. At the transcriptional level, pretreatment of MO with PGE2 attenuated the ability of new PGE2 to inhibit LPS-dependent TNF mRNA expression. Further studies demonstrated that, although the concomitant addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin plus LPS could increase TNF production, MO pretreated with indomethacin, washed, and then challenged with LPS demonstrated an inhibition of TNF expression. MO pretreated with indomethacin also demonstrated an increased sensitivity for exogenous PGE2-induced suppression of TNF mRNA and bioactivity. These investigations further support the role of PGE2 as an immunomodulating compound that may effectively regulate the local concentration of specific monokines needed to maintain an inflammatory lesion.\r"

Cytolysin-mediated lysis of RBC was inhibited by either low ionic strength or low pH. Under these conditions a nonlytic cytolysin-RBC intermediate was formed as revealed by hemolysis when cytolysin pretreated cells were washed and resuspended at physiologic ionic strength and pH. Formation of the cytolysin-RBC intermediate at low ionic strength (250 mM sucrose), pH 7.3, required greater than 0.1 mM calcium. In contrast, formation of the intermediate at physiologic ionic strength (150 mM NaCl), pH 6.0, was calcium independent. Both types of intermediates were stable at 37 degrees C and required calcium to induce subsequent lysis. The degree of lysis of the intermediate generated at low ionic strength was similar to that measured under standard conditions with the use of either whole granule preparations or purified cytolysin. However, lysis of intermediates formed at pH 6.0 was much less efficient. Our data indicate that a stable cytolysin-RBC intermediate can be formed in which cytolysin is present in an unreactive state on the RBC surface; under conditions of physiologic ionic strength and calcium concentrations this intermediate rapidly lyses.\r"

  ".W": "Infection of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) with influenza virus causes depression of PMNL metabolic and bactericidal activities. The studies reported here were undertaken to determine whether the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein of influenza virus mediates this depression. PMNL were incubated with purified HA and the oxidative responses to exogenous stimuli were measured. The results indicate that HA, in either liposomes or protein aggregates referred to as rosettes, depressed PMNL oxidative responses. Depression was observed within 2 min of initial interaction of HA with PMNL and lasted more than 2 h. The membrane fusion activity of HA requires proteolytic cleavage of the HA, whereas the receptor binding activity does not. There was no difference in the ability of virions with cleaved or uncleaved HA to depress PMNL responses suggesting that the fusion event is not required for PMNL dysfunction. Inasmuch as the HA glycoprotein binds to sialic acid-containing receptors on the surface of the PMNL, we tested whether other sialic acid-specific binding proteins can mediate the reduction of PMNL responses. Sialic acid-specific lectins from Limulus polyphemus or Limax flavus were incubated with PMNL before measuring their responses to secondary stimulus. Depression was observed upon incubation with the lectins similar to that seen upon incubation with the HA or influenza virus. These results suggest that attachment of influenza virus to sialic acid-containing receptors is responsible at least in part, for suppressing PMNL oxidative responses.\r"

  ".W": "In hypereosinophilic patients, eosinophil heterogeneity has been assessed mainly according to morphologic and biologic criteria. In order to investigate the molecular basis of such heterogeneity, biochemical analysis was performed on various eosinophil subpopulations fractionated on metrizamide gradients. Whole cell extracts from purified eosinophils disrupted with a nonionic (NP-40) detergent were successively analyzed by SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing or nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis in the first dimension). Hypodense eosinophils that sediment in the lightest density gradients (18 to 22% metrizamide solution) differed from other purified eosinophils (intermediate and normodense eosinophils respectively collected in 22 to 23% and 23 to 25% metrizamide solutions). Comparative analysis of protein patterns on both monodimensional and bidimensional electrophoresis showed that a basic protein of Mr 51 kDa, present on normodense or intermediate eosinophils, was poorly detected in the case of hypodense eosinophils. In contrast, two other proteins with apparent Mr of about 23 kDa and 41 kDa were exclusively or predominantly identified in these latter cell fractions. Immunochemical analysis with polyclonal antibodies against eosinophil basic proteins and enzymatic assays revealed that the 51-kDa polypeptide could be related to an eosinophil peroxidase-like molecule. In addition, the two proteins detected only in hypodense eosinophils might be related to proteins newly synthesized by in vivo activated eosinophils. Our results suggest that variations in protein expression might represent a good marker of in vivo activation.\r"

This study was designed to test the role of each IgG subclass in the eosinophil-dependent killing reaction. IgG antibodies purified by protein G or protein A affinity chromatography demonstrated a killing effect only in the presence of eosinophils activated in vivo or normal eosinophils activated in vitro by eosinophil activating factor. Purification of each IgG isotype allowed confirmation of these results and demonstrated that the killing effect was associated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies. IgG2 antibodies expressed a dual function: 1) an effector function with activated eosinophils and 2) a blocking function with normal eosinophils. IgG4 antibodies, whatever the source of eosinophils, blocked the killing mediated by IgG effector antibodies. These findings are discussed in relation to immunity and susceptibility to reinfection in human schistosomiasis.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) isolated from 12 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, or breast adenocarcinoma were expanded in rIL-2 for 22 to 45 days (median 33 days) and analyzed for lymphokine mRNA expression and patterns of TCR gene rearrangement. All TIL cultures were significantly enriched for T cells, with CD3+ CD8+ cells predominant in 8 of 10 cases tested, and demonstrated an oligoclonal (rather than polyclonal) pattern of TCR gene rearrangement. Nine of 12 cultures could effectively lyse the autologous targets in short term chromium release assays. IL-2 expanded-TIL expressed mRNA for TNF-alpha and TNF-beta (lymphotoxin) and, in 5 of 9 (41%) cases, granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor mRNA but not IL-1 beta or IL-2 transcripts. Cultured TIL deprived of rIL-2 for 4 days did not constitutively express mRNA for any of the lymphokines tested. One long term TIL line in culture was followed and periodically tested for lytic activity and TNF-mRNA expression. Loss of the specific cytolytic but not proliferative activity at day 85 was associated with disappearance of TNF mRNA. Profiles of lymphokine secretion may provide a useful marker for functionally characterizing different T cell subsets and may provide correlates of the in vivo anti-tumor effects of these cells when TIL are adoptively transferred into cancer-bearing patients.\r"

A similar correlation was observed between threshold levels of E1A gene product expression and target cell susceptibility to direct cytotoxicity by rTNF. Inhibition of splenic NK cell and peritoneal macrophage cytolysis by antisera specific for murine rTNF confirmed the importance of E1A-induced TNF susceptibility as one determinant of target cell cytolytic susceptibility. Anti-TNF antibody was, however, unable to block killing of E1A-expressing targets by the NK cell line, NKB61A2. These results suggest a direct link between the functions of E1A oncogene products and cellular mechanisms of action of TNF elaborated by host effector cells and indicate that E1A expression also affects target cell susceptibility to TNF-independent cytolytic mechanisms.\r"

The L1 coat protein (54 Kd) was found in trace amounts in unmodified and slightly modified forms in the labeled empty and light full particles but could not be detected in the labeled heavy particles. L1 appeared to exist in the three unlabeled particle types in differentially modified forms. A putative L2 protein was also found to be modified (74-80 Kd) and was found preferentially in the unlabeled heavy full particles. The commercial cross-reactive BPV antibody recognized a labeled 58-Kd protein found predominantly in the empty and light full particles and a pair of proteins (41-42 Kd) found unlabeled in the heavy full particles. Besides L1, there were several other proteins (IEF 40 Kd; NEPHGE 42, 38, and 36 Kd) which were detected labeled in the empty particles and in increasing unlabeled amounts in the light full and heavy full particles. Four proteins (IEF 66, 13 and 11 Kd, and NEPHGE 9 Kd) were found exclusively in the full particles and may be involved in packing the viral genome. These observations suggest that a virus particle assembly pathway exists from the empty particles, via the light full, to the mature heavy full particles.\r"

  ".U": "89256747\r", 
  ".W": "The biochemical changes underlying the clinical manifestations of psoriasis are unknown. Certain chemotactic eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid metabolism have been suggested to play important roles in psoriasis, because of their presence in lesional psoriatic skin and their ability to elicit skin inflammation and to stimulate epidermal proliferation. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate which eicosanoids might be involved in the early phases of the inflammatory processes of psoriasis. Eicosanoids were analyzed in scale and in lesional skin without scale both in acute guttate and chronic plaque psoriatic lesions. Methods for identification of eicosanoids included reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography combined with radioimmunoassay. Leukotriene B4 was present in both acute guttate and chronic plaque skin lesions in biologically active amounts (acute guttate lesions: 18.7 +/- 7.1 ng/g wet tissue in scale and 3.2 +/- 1.5 ng/g wet tissue in lesional skin without scale; chronic plaque lesions: 33.1 +/- 9.7 ng/g wet tissue in scale and 5.3 +/- 2.0 ng/g wet tissue in lesional skin without scale). 12- and 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) reached biologically active concentrations only in scale of chronic plaque lesions (1,512 +/- 282 and 1,441 +/- 411 ng/g wet tissue, respectively). The level of prostaglandin E2 in chronic plaque lesions was similar to the level in normal skin, while the level in acute guttate lesions was increased twofold (71.0 +/- 14.8 ng/g wet tissue). These results demonstrate that leukotriene B4, but not 12-HETE, is present in acute guttate psoriatic skin lesions in concentrations able to exert biologic effects. Leukotriene B4 may therefore participate in inflammatory changes of acute psoriasis.\r"

This antibody reacts with an antigen found on squamous cell carcinomas but does not react with normal keratinocytes. This antibody and two antibodies that react with normal keratinocytes were used as markers of malignant and normal phenotypes. These markers were used to evaluate several spontaneous and carcinogen initiated SCC tumors and to identify the expression of an antigen associated with a malignant phenotype. A variety of subpopulations in carcinogen initiated tumors and spontaneous SCC tumors were noted. The subpopulations that reacted only with MoAb OSU 22-3 exhibited features of anchorage independent growth and cellular invasiveness, and formed progressively growing tumors in nude mice. Other SCC spontaneous tumor cell subpopulations reacted with the antibodies associated with normal keratinocytes. These cells did not proliferate in vitro and did not form tumors in the nude mouse. There were other carcinogen transformed cells which reacted with MoAb OSU 22-3 but not with the antibodies associated with normal keratinocytes. These cells exhibited anchorage independent growth and cellular invasiveness but did not form tumors in nude mice. We conclude from this work that human SCC tumors contain multiple cell populations. These cell populations have varied growth properties and express surface antigens that may indicate their malignant vigor. Carcinogen transformed keratinocytes do exhibit some of the characteristics of SCC tumor phenotypes but not the property of malignant progressively growing cells on a routine and consistent basis. This feature is transiently and inconsistently expressed in a surrogate host by populations prepared from spontaneous SSC tumors.\r"

There may be, however, a great difference in water content within the SC between the lowermost layer that faces the wet underlying living tissue and the superficial portion of the SC that is exposed to the relatively dry ambient atmosphere. To better understand the water profile of the SC and also to verify the accuracy of measurements of high frequency conductance used to evaluate the hydration state of the skin surface, we devised a simple and convenient in vitro model of the SC that stimulates the in vivo setting of the SC. It consists of an isolated sheet of SC whose lower surface covers a pad of water-saturated filter paper, and its upper surface is exposed to the ambient atmosphere. By placing this model in environments with different relative humidities (RH), we confirmed that the recorded conductance values correlated well with the actual water content of the SC (r = 0.94). Using a model having five layers of SC sheets, the water content of the innermost portion of the SC was estimated to be equivalent to about 90% of its dry weight; this level of water content remaining relatively constant over a wide range of ambient RH except in extraordinarily humid environments above 90% RH when water began to accumulate excessively in the whole SC. Using this five SC-sheet model, it was clearly demonstrated that there was an almost straight water concentration gradient from the lowermost layer to the uppermost layer of the SC. We also confirmed that the skin conductance of the high frequency current correlated well with the water content of the superficial portion of the SC as well as with that of the whole SC, therefore, it is a good parameter of the hydration state of the superficial layer of the SC.\r"

  ".U": "89256751\r", 
  ".W": "Current methods for the predictive and diagnostic assessment of contact sensitization rely on the visual scoring of skin reactions. Predictive animal tests, generally using guinea pigs, require a relatively large number of animals to produce a sufficient database for interpreting skin reaction scores. In vitro assays have the potential of being more quantitative than skin testing and, if so, would require fewer animals. However, although in vitro assays are commonly used to study the cellular immune response to strong contact sensitizers, there has been little effort to validate them for predictive assessment purposes. We have optimized an in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis assay for detecting the response of mouse lymphocytes to strong contact sensitizers with the eventual objective of applying this assay to moderate and weak sensitizers as well. Lymph node lymphocytes from mice sensitized to the strong contact allergens, dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), or trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB), responded [greater than or equal to 12,000 counts per minute (CPM) above background] when cultured with water soluble chemical analogues, di- or trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS or TNBS). However, the strong sensitizer, oxazolone (OXAZ), has no water soluble analogue and lymphocytes from mice sensitized to OXAZ responded poorly in vitro (less than 2000 CPM) to an ethanol-solubilized OXAZ preparation in spite of very strong in vivo sensitization (ear swelling assay). To increase the assay sensitivity, for OXAZ, we modified the antigen presentation conditions by using 1) solubilized antigen-modified adherent spleen cells, 2) dendritic cells from the draining lymph nodes of antigen painted mice, and 3) antigen-modified Langerhans cell-enriched cultured epidermal cells (EC). These approaches increased OXAZ-directed responses to greater than 7000, greater than 20,000, and greater than 100,000 CPM, respectively, under culture conditions optimized for cell density, responder: stimulator cell ratio, culture duration, and responder cell type. Our results represent a first attempt to directly modify cultured epidermal cells with OXAZ and use these cells to stimulate OXAZ-directed blastogenesis in microtiter plate cultures. This optimized assay is now under evaluation for predictive assessment of contact sensitizers relevant to occupational and consumer exposures.\r"

  ".W": "It has been clearly demonstrated that cutaneous blood vessels will be selectively damaged by a laser whose wavelength matches one of the three absorption spectral peaks of the chromophore, oxyhemoglobin, for example, 577 nm. A restriction in the application of this wavelength for the treatment of benign cutaneous vascular tumors, such as portwine stains, has been the penetration depth of 577 nm irradiation of approximately 0.5 mm from the dermal epidermal junction (DEJ). This study was undertaken to establish whether it was possible to increase the penetration depth from 0.5 mm by changing the wavelength to beyond 577 nm in albino pig skin. Results from this study confirm that penetration depth increases from 0.5 to 1.2 mm by changing the wavelength from 577 to 585 nm at 4 J/cm2, while maintaining the same degree of vascular selectivity as that previously described after 577 nm irradiation. This occurred in spite of a mismatch in the wavelength between 585 nm and the oxyhemoglobin absorption peak of 577 nm. Unlike 585 nm irradiation and in contrast with theoretical predictions, 590 nm laser light did not penetrate as deeply as 585 nm. Not only was there a reduction in the penetration depth of the laser beam from 1.2 mm at 585 nm to 0.8 mm at 590 nm, at 4 J/cm2, but there was also a decrease in vascular selectivity in albino pig skin exposed to 590 nm irradiation.\r"

After three doses of vaccine, infants in all vaccine groups developed similar secretory IgA response to VP1 and VP2. The antibody response to VP3 was observed in 76.5% of subjects immunized with OPV alone and approximately 60% of those immunized with IPV-EP followed by OPV. However, only 13% of those immunized with IPV-EP alone exhibited VP3-specific antibody response. Significant differences in poliovirus type 3 specific antibody activity were observed between OPV and IPV-EP immunized subjects when trypsin-treated poliovirus was used as the antigen for neutralization or for ELISA in vitro. The neutralizing antibody activity against cleaved virus was significantly higher than against whole virus in the OPV vaccinated subjects. Both neutralizing and ELISA antibody activity against cleaved virus was significantly lower than against the whole virus in IPV-EP immunized subjects.\r"

All serum samples were negative in competitive ELISAs and radioimmunoassays for HTLV-1 and HIV-1; selected samples of reactive sera were negative in an HTLV-2 competitive ELISA. Immunofluorescent antibody tests using HTLV-1 infected cells correlated poorly with ELISA results. None of the sera from Papua New Guinea neutralized vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes of HTLV-1.

Although amantadine-resistant mutants have been shown to be readily generated both in the laboratory and in children treated with rimantadine, little is known about their biologic properties, such as genetic stability, transmissibility, or pathogenicity, compared with the parental virus. This study examined these properties using an avian influenza virus, A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 (H5N2). Variants that were amantadine-resistant, virulent, and capable of competing with wild-type virus for transmission to susceptible hosts in the absence of the drug were selected. These amantadine-resistant variants were also genetically stable, showing no reversion to wild-type after six passages in birds over a period of greater than 20 d. Thus, these virus variants had no detectable biologic impairment. The mutations conferring drug resistance were in the M2 polypeptide and were identical to mutations previously described in human amantadine-resistant virus. These results suggest that resistant mutants may have the potential to threaten the effective use of amantadine and rimantadine for the control of epidemic influenza.\r"

This model achieved approximately 90% mortality within 10 d of infection. Pseudomonas organisms were inconsistently shed from the feces despite gastrointestinal colonization (9 fecal v. 23 cecal cultures positive for challenge strain in 28 rats). Treatment of rats with oral ciprofloxacin at 40 mg/kg afforded complete protection. A suboptimal dose of ciprofloxacin (20 mg/kg), achieving peak levels of 0.31 micrograms/mL in serum and 26.3 micrograms/mL in stool, resulted in survival of 8 (40%) of 20 rats. Intraperitoneal administration of a monoclonal antibody directed at the lipopolysaccharide of the challenge strain of Pseudomonas resulted in survival of 5 rats (26%). The combination of the two increased the survival to 75% (15 of 20, P less than 0.05 compared to either treatment alone). Thus, the combination of suboptimal doses of ciprofloxacin and a monoclonal antibody appears to protect leukopenic rats from lethal infection better than either treatment alone.\r"

When exponential-phase cultures were exposed to half the MIC of vancomycin, a lag of 3-4 h occurred before growth resumed. Cells preexposed to 1/2 MICs of vancomycin did not show any lag. Pregrowth of D366 with vancomycin caused resistance to all glycopeptides tested. Pregrowth in vancomycin resulted in synthesis of a 3.95-kDa cytoplasmic-membrane-associated protein. This protein was correlated with resistance in mutants with high-level resistance, in the presence of NaCl, which inhibited the activity of vancomycin, and when several glycopeptides with varying activities were tested. Vancomycin-grown cells appeared abnormal and lysed at a much slower rate than did normal cells. We conclude that (1) vancomycin resistance in D366 is inducible; (2) resistance is correlated with the synthesis of 39.5-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein; and (3) this protein play an additional role in the inhibition of normal lytic functions.\r"

Serial trypsin digestion of in vitro and in vivo aged ova revealed an increase in zona digestion time (0.25% trypsin) beginning at 40 hr, which increased over a 40-hr period and resulted in the unfertilized zona becoming as \"hard\" as the fertilized embryo zona. In vitro fertilizability showed a rapid decrease as zona hardening occurred with loss of cortical granules as assessed by electron microscopy. These data suggest that the window of fertilizability is \"closed\" by a spontaneous zona reaction occurring at about 55 hr post-human chorionic gonadotropin with loss of cortical granules and zona hardening as manifested by increasing zona digestion time with 0.25% trypsin.\r"

Mid-cycle, sperm-free cervical mucus was provided by 18 women. During incubation aliquots were drawn from the culture chamber every hour for analysis of sperm characteristics. A pronounced increase in motility was observed. The number of penetrated sperms averaged 1 million after 3 hr. The percentage normal morphology increased from 42 +/- 11 to 73 +/- 15 (mean +/- SD). It is suggested that \"swim-over\" should prove useful for obtaining sperm of high quality. Further studies for refinement and evolution of the method are currently in progress.\r"

Based on the results of 412 follicles aspirated, the data were grouped by size (less than or equal to 11, 12-14, 15-17, 18-20, and greater than or equal to 21 mm) and oocyte maturity. Recovery rates were significantly higher in 18- to 20-mm follicles (P less than 0.01) and lower in those less than or equal to 11 mm (P less than 0.001). The probability of retrieving a metaphase I or II oocyte was significantly lower in follicles less than or equal to 11 mm (P less than 0.001), somewhat higher in 12- to 14-mm follicles (P less than 0.01), and equally high among the other groups. There were no differences in the incidence of fractured zonas. We conclude that follicles greater than or equal to 15 mm provide the highest probability of retrieving mature oocytes and the low recovery rates of mature oocytes from follicles less than or equal to 11 mm suggest that, in selected circumstances, the operating surgeon may choose not to aspirate them.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, some beneficial effects of mouse prolactin (PRL) on spermatozoa were demonstrated in mice. The motility rate of spermatozoa is well maintained during incubation in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (mKRB) containing PRL (10 or 100 ng/ml) for up to 120 min. When spermatozoa that had been preincubated in the same PRL-containing mKRB were incubated with oocytes in mKRB, significantly more spermatozoa attached to the zona pellucida of each oocyte. When spermatozoa that had been preincubated in mKRB with PRL (50 and 100 ng/ml) for only 15 or 30 min were used for in vitro fertilization (IVF), significantly higher fertilization rates were yielded by those spermatozoa than by control spermatozoa preincubated without PRL for the same periods. The prolongation of the preincubation period did not result in increased fertilization rates. Thus, PRL demonstrated biological effects on spermatozoa by shortening the optimal preincubation period for spermatozoa to acquire capacitation and by maintaining their motility and ability of the attachment to the oocyte during IVF. The results are relevant to clinical application of PRL for infertile patients with oligozoospermia or asthenozoospermia.\r"

Two hundred ten and two hundred two follicles were aspirated with each needle, respectively. Follicular diameters were measured ultrasonically at the time of aspiration and recorded. One or more washes were performed when using the DLN and the SLN was withdrawn each time to recover the fluid in the dead space of the needle. The distribution of follicular sizes was the same for both needles. Oocyte recovery rates (SLN = 65.7%; DLN = 63.9%) and the incidence of fractured zonae (SLN = 9.1%; DLN = 6.4%) were the same for both needles (alpha greater than 0.50; beta less than 0.01). Although there were no differences between the two needles in the number of oocytes provided for IVF, there were technical differences. The DLN needle was more flexible and frequently deviated from the projected path as observed by ultrasound. The SLN may be preferable because it is technically easier to use; however, there may remain specific indications for the use of the DLN.\r"

In Goteborg, none of 1660 men aged 50 and 51 years, randomly selected from the census register, was found to have HH. In Stockholm, nine out of 11,920 male hospital inpatients were diagnosed as having HH. The calculated mean and 95% confidence ranges were consistent with earlier findings in two studies on men in Malmo, the third largest urban area in Sweden. Pooling results from these three main urban areas, the mean prevalence was 0.073% (17/23, 355), which is considerably lower than figures reported from one area in northern Sweden and from pedigree analyses in several other areas in the world. Screening of the US population in the N-HANES II study also showed much lower figures. The reasons for these discrepancies are discussed and it is suggested that the average prevalence of HH in Caucasian populations is probably around 0.1%.\r"

In seven patients with pulmonary embolism, APTt was checked every fourth hour during 48 h of continuous, constant heparin treatment. In only one patient was a distinct circadian variation of APTt values seen. In six patients with venous leg thromboses, treated with s.c. heparin, marked variations in APTt were noticed over periods of 12 h. These variations paralleled the regular s.c. injections of heparin every twelfth hour. The results of the present study could not confirm the marked circadian variations in APTt reported in an earlier French study during continuous heparin infusions, except in one patient.\r"

Stroke volume was calculated as the product of aortic or pulmonic cross-sectional area and the time velocity integral of the flow across that valve, and the stenotic valve area was obtained as the stroke volume divided by the time velocity integral of the stenotic valve. In addition, the mitral valve area was estimated by the pressure half-time method of Hatle et al. The non-invasive determinations were compared with those calculated by the Gorlin formula at cardiac catheterization. The valve area obtained by combined cross-sectional and Doppler echocardiography showed a close correlation with the Gorlin area, r = 0.90, SEE = 0.13 cm2, n = 20. In contrast, the valve area estimated by the pressure half-time method showed only a moderate correlation with the Gorlin area, r = 0.68, SEE = 0.38 cm2, n = 18, and estimates by this method tended to significantly overestimate the Gorlin area. In conclusion, non-invasive valve area determinations based on combined cross-sectional and Doppler echocardiography can be used to accurately quantify the severity of the lesion in patients with atrioventricular valve stenosis, while determinations by the pressure half-time method may show errors of a magnitude that limits its clinical applicability.\r"

She responded only temporarily to corticosteroids, and splenectomy had to be performed later. After this operation the platelet count was normalized, but a marked and rapid deterioration of her previously indolent PBC occurred. The time-relationship indicates that the removal of the spleen may be considered the cause of the disease's progression. Possible mechanisms behind this adverse effect of the splenectomy are discussed. After initiation of azathioprine therapy a good response in clinical and laboratory features of the PBC was obtained, although the histological picture has remained unchanged.\r"

The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services.\r"

During a 12-month period, 125 observations of resident-attending physician interactions were recorded; the average length of the interactions was 4.27 minutes. The six most frequent resident verbal behaviors compared by postgraduate year level did not vary significantly. Only one of the six most frequent attending physician verbal behaviors varied significantly. In the average interaction of about 4 minutes, three fourths of the interaction was on patient care issues, leaving little time for teaching. There are many unanswered questions about the resident-attending physician interaction and its contribution to the training of a physician.\r"

  ".W": "The worst peacetime disaster in United States Army history occurred on December 12, 1985 in Gander, Newfoundland. A charter airline carrying 248 soldiers home from peacekeeping duties in the Sinai Desert crashed after a refueling stop, killing all on board. After the crash, Army family assistance workers were appointed to help the surviving family members of each dead soldier. While substantial attention has been paid to the impact of sudden disasters on survivors and bereaved relatives, little is known about the health risks to those who perform helper roles. This study aimed to: a) identify the major stress areas for disaster family assistance workers; b) examine the relation between degree of exposure to these stressors and health; and c) locate risk factors, or resistance resources that might modulate any ill effects of exposure. A survey instrument assessed duration and intensity of family-helping activities and psychological well-being, psychiatric symptoms, major illness indicators, and social and personality variables at 6 months after the crash and again at the 1-year point for 131 family assistance officers. Results indicate a dose-response effect between exposure measured at time 1 and well-being, symptoms, and illness at time 2. Analysis of covariance findings also show that social supports (work supervisors, family, and friends) modulate the effects of exposure on symptoms and well-being. Social supports and the personality style of hardiness (or dispositional resilience) interact to modulate the effects of exposure on illness. These results demonstrate: a) a delayed negative impact of helper stress on family assistance workers, and b) a protective function of social supports and personality hardiness. Further research in this area should thus consider the potential influence of social/situational variables and personality dispositions in coping with disaster helper stress.\r"

The results show that PTSD with panic disorder is better explained by war stressors than other diagnostic combinations and that high-risk assignments and exposure to grotesque deaths were more salient than other stressor experiences in accounting for different diagnostic combinations. Implications of the findings for PTSD's placement in the DSM-III-R and for psychological and pharmacological treatments were discussed.\r"

The most striking finding was a difference in the direction of both TT4 and FT4 change during clinical recovery in the PS group compared with the other three groups. Analysis of the delta values, representing the change between admission and discharge values, revealed significant differences between the mean rise in the PS group vs. the mean decreases in the other three groups for both TT4 (p less than .0003) and FT4 (p less than .003). For TT4, 75% of the PS group showed a rise during recovery in contrast to 4% of the remaining groups; for FT4, 50% of the PS group showed a rise compared with 14% of the other groups. A significant difference was also observed between the FT4 levels of bipolar I, manic vs. PS patients at the time of hospital admission, which may have potential usefulness in the differential diagnosis of these two disorders. This study emphasizes the importance of exploring more fully the psychiatric significance of thyroxine levels within the endocrinological normal range and of doing longitudinal assessments of thyroxine and symptom changes during clinical recovery in psychiatric disorders.\r"

  ".W": "This is the first empirical report suggesting a menstrual-linked artifact in determining rates of depression. We investigated the effects of perceived menstrual cycle phase, and premenstrual and postmenstrual timing in the cycle, on scores for a self-report measure of depression that is widely used in epidemiological studies, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The first study used a cross-sectional design and the second used a follow-up design with repeated measures across the menstrual cycle. Both studies assessed a community-based sample of regularly menstruating women. In the second study, testing was also done at 2-week intervals in men for comparison purposes. Both studies supported the hypothesis of a significant menstrual cycle-related effect on CES-D scores. The menstrual-linked effect is greater than the test-retest variability observed in men, such that women more often tend to meet the cut-off criteria for depression on the CES-D premenstrually, as compared with postmenstrually. Thus it is possible that cyclic variations in ratings on the CES-D may elevate epidemiological estimates of depression, as defined by RDC criteria, for menstruating women. Further longitudinal assessment in randomly selected samples will be needed in order to clarify whether a menstrual-linked effect is substantial and specific enough to require correction, or documentation of cycle phase, in epidemiological studies of depression.\r"

The modifications of older instruments and those instruments more recently developed are described. Clearly instruments require additional validity testing and better test-retest reliability.

However, the use of these scores in clinical research has been limited, perhaps in part because of the concern that the stated level of statistical significance may be exaggerated when there is a high degree of correlation between the exposure and the set of confounders. We present a specific example and computer simulations to suggest that exaggeration of statistical significance occurs only under unusual circumstances when the correlation between the exposure and the confounders is extreme. Our simulations also suggest that an analysis based on stratification by a propensity score is less affected by high correlation between the exposure and the confounders than is an analysis based on a multivariate confounder score.\r"

In the general case, a distinction has to be made between risk during exposure and that after its discontinuation. For both of these risks, modifications of their magnitudes especially by previous exposure to the same agent must be considered. These risks are studied by focusing on incidence densities specific to subintervals of the total periods of risk. Assessment of these densities is generally best accomplished by following a (very large) dynamic (open) population, not specified on the basis of exposure. Cases of the adverse event, without regard for their etiology, that occur in this source population over the period of follow-up need to be identified and classified, first as to whether they arose from the study population proper or from the extraneous segment of the source population. Those arising from the study population and characterized by \"recent\" exposure--implying potential causation by it--need to be classified according to the attained duration of exposure and, where applicable, time since its discontinuation at the time of the inception of the adverse event. An appropriate sample of the source population over its follow-up needs to be obtained and classified in like manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These rates were analyzed to describe simultaneously the changes affecting successive birth cohorts and the changes associated with the period in which the onset of the disorder occurred, using age-period-cohort (APC) models. The non-identifiability problem inherent in all APC models was resolved by assuming that the linear period effect and linear cohort effect were non-negative. This assumption is consistent with our a priori substantive knowledge of the disease. Under this assumption, as the linear period effect varies from its minimum to its maximum values, a family of curves representing the possible effects of a factor was generated for each of the time factors--age, period and cohort. The results of the analysis showed a sharp increase in rates of major depression among both men and women in the birth cohort born during the years 1935-1945. The rates among females, however, seemed to have stabilized in the generations born since 1945, while the rates in males continued to rise sharply among the cohorts born in the following decade, after which, in 1955, they also levelled off. In contrast, the rates associated with period of onset of major depression continued to increase between the years 1960-1980 among both men and women of all ages studied. These findings are considered in light of the persistent concentration of depression in women and in biologically related members of families of affected individuals.\r"

In this first paper we discuss the selection of relevant attributes to comprise the health-state descriptions, and the relative merits of three measurement strategies: holistic, explicitly decomposed, and statistically inferred decomposed. The functional measurement approach, a statistically inferred decomposed strategy, is recommended because it simultaneously validates the process by which judges combine attributes, the scale values they assign to health states, and the interval property of the scale.\r"

Diseases of the arteries and pneumonia, which are among the most common underlying causes of death, appeared more often on death certificates in both 1955 and 1980 as contributing causes than as underlying the death. Diabetes was studied in detail in the 1955 report, and comparisons were made in 1980 to show increases in the proportions of deaths with this disease and corresponding increases in its prevalence among the living population from the National Health Survey. Multiple cause of death data can provide further information on the prevalence of a fatal disease in a population and its relative role in contributing to mortality, and can also provide new information on diseases that contribute to deaths, which was not previously available in population-based studies of single cause of death.\r"

Agreement was measured by per cent exact agreement and weighted kappa for frequencies of 30 itemized foods or food groups, and for surrogate- and subject-based quintiles of frequencies of eight broad food groups and of vitamin A and C consumption indexes. Surrogate and subject mean frequencies were generally similar, but at the individual level of analysis, agreement varied widely. Agreement was greatest, among the food items and groups, for alcoholic beverages, and among the other items, for smoking status. Extreme misclassification by quintile was very small, but only 40% of persons self-classified in either extreme quintile were similarly classified by their spouses. This level of misclassification may result in the dilution of real relationships between diet and health.\r"

This leads to spuriously high systolic and low diastolic pressure readings. The ROSE damping device is being marketed as a possible solution to the problem. We tested the dynamic response of three different catheter systems, with various pressure-tubing lengths of 1 to 7 feet (30.5 to 213.4 cm), with and without the ROSE damping device. The device was able to substantially increase damping and at the same time maintain the undamped natural frequency. Typically it increased the damping coefficient from a minimum of 0.17 +/- 0.01 to a minimum of 0.33 +/- 0.01, while never significantly decreasing the undamped natural frequency. In testing a sample of 25 devices we did observe, however, a wide variability in damping characteristics among different devices. Damping coefficients ranged between 0.19 and 1.20.\r"

We describe a patient in whom EEG changes indicative of cerebral ischemia occurred at the time of carotid clamping. The changes resolved promptly after placement of a carotid shunt but recurred 11 minutes later. Because of the EEG changes, the carotid shunt was evaluated and found to have become occluded. EEG monitoring was crucial to the detection of shunt occlusion in the absence of other systemic changes or surgical difficulties. The rapidity and magnitude of the changes in the EEG suggest that, if the occlusion had not been discovered and the patency of the shunt restored, the patient would have been at increased risk for neurologic injury.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of pulse oximeters from fourteen manufacturers was tested during profound brief hypoxic plateaus in 125 subject sets using 50 normal adult volunteers, of whom 29 were studied two to nine times. A data set usually consisted of 10 subjects, and 13 sets were collected between August 1987 and July 1988. In the first 6 sets, six 30-second hypoxic plateaus were obtained per subject at 55 +/- 6% oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) (range, 40 to 70%). In the last 7 sets, three hypoxic plateaus were obtained at each of four levels, approximately 86, 74, 62, and 50% O2Hb, for the purpose of linear regression analysis. Inspired oxygen was adjusted manually breath by breath in response to arterial oxygen saturation computed on-line from end-tidal oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions. End-plateau arterial blood O2Hb was analyzed by a Radiometer OSM-3 oximeter, and plateau pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) was read by cursor from a computer record of the analog output. Three to 13 instruments were tested simultaneously by using 1 to 3 duplicate instruments from each of one to seven manufacturers. Variations introduced by manufacturers were tested on subsequent sets in several instruments. An index of error, \"ambiguity\" (alpha) of oxygen saturation, was defined as the absolute sum of bias and precision (mean and SD of SpO2 - O2Hb) at O2Hb = 55.8 +/- 4.5%, preserving the sign when bias was significant at P less than 0.05. Ambiguity values for finger probes (unless specified) with latest data were: Physio-Control, 3.9 (ear, 3.3); Puritan-Bennett, -4.4; Criticare, 5.8 (forehead, 4.7); Kontron, 5.9 (infant probe) and 6.1 (ear, 5.8; forehead, 7.1); Biochem, -6.0; Datex 6.4 (ear, 6.9; forehead, 6.8); Critikon, 8.4; SiMed, 8.6; Marquest, 9.0; Novametrix, 10.2; Invivo, -12.2 (ear, -14.3); Nellcor, -15.1; Ohmeda, -21.2; and Radiometer, -21.2 (ear, -9.6). Linear regression slopes of 36 instruments from twelve manufacturers generally deviated from 1 in proportion to alpha. The data showed substantial differences in bias and precision between pulse oximeters at low saturations, the most common problems being underestimation of saturation and failing precision.\r"

There were no statistically significant differences in the low saturation values between the two groups.

The algorithm automatically identifies and interprets critical events so that an untrained user can manage the mechanical ventilation of a critically injured crew member. The algorithm was tested in two healthy volunteers by simulating 260 critical events in each volunteer while the volunteer breathed via the ventilator. Thirteen critical events were induced eight times in random order, for the five different modes of ventilation. These events included various ventilator tubing disconnects, leaks, and occlusions, as well as power and gas supply failures. The algorithm identified the critical events and generated alarms in response to 99.2% (516 of 520, total) of the events. The alarm textual messages were correct 98% (505 of 516 messages) of the time. The alarm algorithm is an improvement over current alarms found on most ventilators because its alarm messages specifically identify failures in the patient breathing circuit or ventilator. The system may improve patient care by helping critical care personnel respond more rapidly and correctly to critical events.\r"

Triglyceride synthesis was reduced by safflower oil feeding. Relative distribution of labeled carbon into liver triglycerides and phospholipids was also reduced. In vivo incorporation of labeled carbon from [1-14C]acetate into egg yolk triglycerides and phospholipids closely paralleled that in liver slices, suggesting that the liver controls the pattern of lipid incorporation into yolk.

  ".W": "To study effects of dietary protein source on plasma cholesterol homeostasis, six littermate pairs of 8-wk-old, castrated male pigs were assigned randomly to high fat diets containing either lean beef or soy protein isolate, with beef tallow as the major fat source in both diets. Diets were fed for 6 wk, with blood samples taken weekly and analyzed for lipid composition. At 6 wk, each pig was injected with [3H]cholesterol- and [14C]sucrose-labeled low density lipoproteins, and serial blood samples were taken. Pigs were then killed, and several tissues were sampled. Results show that dietary beef or soy protein, when fed with beef tallow as a fat source, has differential effects on rates of uptake of intact LDL by heart, M. sartorius muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and on rates of uptake of LDL cholesterol by net free cholesterol exchange in subcutaneous and perirenal adipose tissues. Dietary protein source affected the composition of only two tissues analyzed. Pigs fed the beef-based diet had greater lipid concentrations in M. sartorius muscle, whereas pigs fed the soy protein-based diet had greater lipid concentrations in heart. Source of dietary protein did not influence in vivo kinetics of LDL cholesterol removal from blood plasma.\r"

Se-Met as well as Met were transported by a single, Na+-dependent, carrier-mediated process common for both amino acids. Evaluation of the kinetic parameters revealed no differences between Se-Met and Met in the maximal transport velocity (Vmax) or in the Michaelis constant (Km). Furthermore, transport of Se-Met and Met showed similar characteristics with respect to electrogenicity and substrate specificity. In addition, evidence was obtained for a competitive inhibition of cystine transport across the BBM by selenocystine and basic amino acids.\r"

Its identity and stereochemistry were demonstrated by HPLC and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The mean urinary beta-AP concentration in the subjects was 0.63 +/- 0.14 microgram/mg creatinine when averaged over two consecutive days of urine collection. Daily beta-AP excretion, determined from two 24-h urine samples collected from five individuals, was 801 +/- 117 micrograms/d (2.7 mumol/d). No diurnal rhythm was evident within the 24-h collection periods. beta-AP was also isolated from human plasma by HPLC and identified by GC-MS. Plasma from subjects contained approximately 5 ng beta-AP/ml. Furthermore, beta-AP was formed when asparagine and phenylalanine were incubated with an enzyme extract from human kidney. Thus, at least some of the beta-AP present in humans, and presumably other beta-aspartyl dipeptides as well, appears to be synthesized endogenously.\r"

The pigs were fed a hulless barley-based diet that was 1) uncooked, 2) baked for 4 h using high moisture, low temperature (37% dry matter, 121 degrees C) conditions (HMLT), or 3) baked for 1 h using lower moisture, high temperature (48% dry matter, 204 degrees C) conditions (LMHT). Ileal digesta and fecal dry matter were not different between the three diets. Pigs fed the HMLT and LMHT diets had 4% and 2% higher starch digestibility at the ileum, respectively, than did pigs fed the uncooked diet (P less than 0.05). Total Klason lignin recovered at the terminal ileum was similar for all diets even though initial Klason lignin values for the LMHT diet were twice that of the uncooked or HMLT diet. Digestibility of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) as measured at the ileum and in the feces of pigs fed the baked diets was about 10% higher than in pigs fed the uncooked diet (P less than 0.1). The ratio of NSP ileal digestion:NSP digestion as measured in the feces was over 0.75 for all diets. Baking increased digestibility in the barley-based diet by increasing the digestibility of starch and dietary fiber. Increasing the severity of baking (LMHT) tended to decrease digestibility compared to the mild baking (HMLT), but not significantly.\r"

Growth, body composition, plasma chemistry (with the exception of glucose), and liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH, EC 1.1.1.49), malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH, 1.1.1.42) activities of sturgeon were significantly (P less than 0.05) affected by the different dietary carbohydrate sources. Sturgeon fed either the maltose or glucose diets had the highest percent energy retained, followed by those fed either the dextrin, raw corn starch or sucrose diets, whereas those fed either the lactose, fructose or cellulose diets had the lowest. Sturgeon fed either the maltose or glucose diets were hyperlipidemic, having twice the amount of plasma total lipid, triacylglycerol and total cholesterol as fish fed the other carbohydrate sources. These two carbohydrate sources were also more lipogenic: maltose- or glucose-fed sturgeon had significantly higher body lipid and liver G6PDH, malic enzyme, and ICDH activities. The poor ability of sturgeon to utilize either sucrose or lactose appears to be due to low intestinal sucrase (EC 3.2.1.48) and lactase (EC 3.2.1.108) activities. Intestinal aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.11), maltase (EC 3.2.1.20), sucrase and lactase activities of sturgeon were not affected by feeding different carbohydrate sources for 8 wk.\r"

We also fed aged guinea pigs two different levels of ascorbic acid (1.5 or 60 mg/d) for 2 mo. Reduced and total ascorbate was measured in eye lens and aqueous humor, liver, kidney and plasma. The data indicate that it is possible to markedly enhance the level of ascorbate in tissues above that obtained by feeding a diet that contains only enough ascorbate to prevent scurvy. In all tissues, as the level of total ascorbate present in the tissue increased, so did the proportion present in the reduced form. In old guinea pigs, the eye lens was the only tissue in which both reduced and total ascorbate were significantly lower than in the young guinea pigs at both high and low intake levels.\r"

However, successful matings, i.e., presence of sperm in the vaginal tract of the female, by vitamin D-deficient males were reduced by 45% when compared to matings by vitamin D-replete males. Fertility (successful pregnancies in sperm-positive females) was reduced by 73% in litters from vitamin D-deficient male inseminations when compared to litters from females inseminated by vitamin D-replete males.

Pyridoxamine, 4'-deoxypyridoxine and 5'-deoxypyridoxal were as effective as unlabeled pyridoxine in inhibiting tracer uptake, whereas pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate, pyridoxal and 4'-pyridoxic acid had no effect, and other vitameric forms and structural analogs caused intermediate inhibition of cellular vitamin uptake. After 30 min, 88% of accumulated radioactive vitamin B-6 in cell extracts had been metabolized to phosphorylated forms and pyridoxal, which supports metabolic trapping as a mechanism responsible for the cellular accumulation observed. Initial uptake was significantly decreased in the presence of ethionine and ouabain; however, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone had no effect. Partial to complete substitution of NH4Cl and LiCl for NaCl had no effect, while partial substitution with RbCl caused significant dose-related inhibition of initial pyridoxine uptake. Amiloride also significantly decreased initial uptake. These data are consistent with a facilitated uptake process for pyridoxine that has substrate specificity and may be modulated by sodium-hydrogen exchange and/or pH gradient effects. Cellular uptake is followed by intracellular metabolic trapping catalyzed by pyridoxal kinase.\r"

To determine if mice also develop decreased plasma PLP concentrations during pregnancy, and if plasma PLP levels in pregnancy reflect tissue levels of PLP and pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate (PMP), we measured PLP concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes and whole blood, and liver and brain PLP and PMP in control and pregnant mice. Mice were fed a nonpurified diet containing 8.13 mg pyridoxine-HCl/kg. The PLP analyses were performed in our newly developed apotryptophanase method in which the substrate S-benzyl-L-cysteine is hydrolyzed to benzyl mercaptan, reacted with Ellman's reagent and measured spectrophotometrically. During pregnancy, plasma PLP levels decreased 50% below control levels, but erythrocyte and whole blood PLP levels increased 2.9- and 1.6-fold, respectively. Liver PLP and PMP decreased 25%, in parallel with plasma PLP, but brain PLP and PMP concentrations were unchanged during pregnancy. These results suggest that metabolism or utilization of vitamin B-6 is altered in pregnancy, and that plasma PLP concentrations alone may not be a good indicator of nutritional status in pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Copper uptake from human ceruloplasmin (Cp) into cells of a human erythroleukemic cell line, K562, was investigated. The interaction between ascorbic acid and the copper atoms in ceruloplasmin was a focal point of the study. Nondenatured 67Cu-labeled ceruloplasmin (67Cu-Cp) was prepared by an ascorbate-catalyzed exchange of Cp with 67CuCl2 in vitro. The complex was stable, even in the presence of 1.0 mM ascorbate. Adding K562 cells and incubating at 37 degrees C resulted in an immediate transfer of 67Cu from ceruloplasmin to the cells. At 37 degrees C the copper accumulated by the K562 cells resisted dissociation by mild acid washing. The rate of transfer of 67Cu was proportional to the Cp concentration in the medium. Ascorbate (100 microM) enhanced the uptake of 67Cu at least fourfold. D-Isoascorbate worked as well as L-ascorbate, suggesting that the reducing potential of the vitamin (or its isomer) was important in the uptake of copper. Approximately 20% of the 67Cu absorbed into the cytosol was precipitable with antibodies to Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD). Ascorbate, however, did not enhance the incorporation of radioactivity into Cu-Zn SOD, suggesting that copper may not be the only rate-limiting factor in the synthesis of this enzyme in K562 cells. The possible relevance of these observations to vitamin C deficiency is discussed.\r"

Decreased cell turnover and/or migration might partly explain these observations. We injected fed and fasted neonatal rabbits with [3H]thymidine. At 1 and 72 h after injection we assessed cell proliferation and migration. Villus height was less in proximal small bowel from fasted rabbits (PF) than in fed controls (PC). Villus height was lower in proximal than in distal small bowel from fasted rabbits (DF). DNA synthesis, as measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, was less in PF and DF than in PC and distal small bowel from fed rabbits (DC) whether expressed per microgram DNA or per intestinal segment. Similarly, thymidine kinase activity was lower in PF and DF than in PC and DC. For both fed and fasted rabbits, more cells were present in the proliferative zone from proximal small bowel than in that from distal. Small bowel labeling index was less in PC than in DC, and less in DF than in DC. The ratio of the number of cells in the proliferative zone to the number of cells in crypt was greater in PC than in DC and greater in DF than in DC. The migration zone was significantly greater in PC than in PF and greater in the fed group in the proximal small bowel than in the distal small bowel. Thus, a 72-h fast in neonatal animals resulted in decreased DNA synthesis and cell migration. Regional alterations in cell proliferation occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Animal models demonstrate a cancer-protective effect of vitamin A. However, human epidemiologic studies correlate the intake of the precursor, beta-carotene, rather than active vitamin A, to a reduced risk for certain cancers. This suggests that beta-carotene may have cancer-protective properties independent of its vitamin A activity. In the present rat study, effects of beta-carotene or active vitamin A on carcinogen metabolizing enzyme activity were evaluated. The activity of intestinal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH, EC 1.14.14.1) was higher in rats fed a purified diet supplemented with beta-carotene than in rats fed the control diet containing adequate vitamin A as retinyl palmitate (165 +/- 30 vs. 90 +/- 18 pmol/min x mg), P less than (0.05). Supplementing the control diet with retinyl acetate had no effect. This AHH-enhancing effect of beta-carotene on the activity of the intestinal mucosal enzyme was not seen on the hepatic enzyme, which is consistent with the nearly complete conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A prior to reaching the liver. These results demonstrate an effect of beta-carotene on carcinogen metabolism which is independent of its vitamin A activity. This may help explain human epidemiologic data, and may lead to further work which would allow for prudent dietary recommendations toward a reduction in cancer risk.\r"

In part, DMA and TMA are products of the metabolism of dietary choline by intestinal bacteria. Most TMA formed in the intestinal tract is later oxidized and excreted as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). Humans treated with large doses of choline smell \"fishy\" (the odor of TMA). Humans ingest choline as part of foods, and yet rarely smell fishy, suggesting that TMA formation must depend upon the dose of choline ingested. We found that, in adult rats, at low doses of choline (1.5 mmol/kg body wt) only 9 mumol choline (6% of the dose) reached the part of the intestine which is colonized by bacteria (the cecum and colon). After administration of 15 mmol choline/kg body wt, 237 mumol (16% of the dose) reached the cecum and colon. At both doses, 64-65% of the administered choline was absorbed from the intestine by 3 h after the dose. We found that orally administered choline slightly increased TMA and TMAO excretion at doses of choline smaller than 7 mmol/kg body wt, but that there was a disproportionately large increase in TMA excretion per 24 h when larger doses were administered (from 11 mumol TMA and 100 mumol TMAO per kg body wt in controls to 226 mumol TMA and 3617 mumol TMAO per kg body wt in rats treated with 15 mmol choline/kg body wt).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the effects of antecedent diet on amylase synthesis during culture, acinar cells from rats fed high fat (HF) or high carbohydrate (HC) diets for 7 d were cultured for 1-48 h in serum-free medium. Amylase activity remained significantly higher in cells from rats fed the HC diet than in cells from rats fed the HF diet through 24 h in culture, despite an overall decrease with time in culture. The relative synthesis of amylase [([3H]phenylalanine amylase/[3H]phenylalanine total protein) x 100] was also significantly higher in cells from HC-fed rats than in cells from HF-fed rats at isolation and remained higher during culture. The results demonstrate that these cultured acinar cells synthesize amylase in vitro and that the effect of diet on amylase activity and relative synthesis persists during culture.\r"

Each of the diets contained 6% NaCl and all rats received DOCA (30 mg/kg body wt, subcutaneously) twice weekly. Systolic blood pressure of rats fed fish oil was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than that of rats fed the control diet; there was no significant difference between the pectin and control groups. Plasma renin activity and net sodium and potassium balances were similar among the three groups. Plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the group fed the fish oil diet than in the group fed the control diet. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol did not differ between rats fed the pectin and rats fed the control diet. Plasma triglyceride concentration did not differ among the three groups. Thus, dietary fish oil attenuated the development of DOCA-salt hypertension, unrelated to alterations of net sodium balance. Fish oil feeding also lowered total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, but did not alter the HDL/LDL ratio. In contrast, dietary pectin exerted no effect on blood pressure or lipid metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Urinary acidification previously was shown to be an effective treatment for calcium-induced urolithiasis in domestic fowl, but diuresis caused by the acidifying agent (ammonium chloride) was an undesirable side effect. Because supplemental dietary methionine reportedly acidifies mammalian urine, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the free acid form of methionine hydroxy analog (MHA) as an acidifying agent for treating avian urolithiasis. From 5 to 17 wk of age, immature Single Comb White Leghorns were fed diets containing normal calcium (1%) or high calcium (3.5%). Diets were supplemented with 0, 0.3 or 0.6% MHA. Relative to birds fed the normal calcium diets, birds fed the high calcium diet without added MHA were in a state of metabolic alkalosis and excreted more alkaline urine containing high levels of calcium. Birds fed the high calcium diet without MHA also had significantly higher kidney asymmetry ratios, a higher incidence of gross kidney damage, and a higher incidence of urolith formation when compared with birds fed normal calcium diets. When compared with the high calcium diet without MHA, the high calcium diet supplemented with 0.6% MHA significantly acidified the urine without causing detectable metabolic acidosis, significantly reduced kidney asymmetry and gross kidney damage, and reduced the incidence of urolith formation without increasing water consumption or urine flow. These data demonstrate that MHA effectively prevents calcium-induced kidney damage in domestic fowl without causing undesirable side effects. MHA did increase both fractional and absolute calcium excretion during calcium loading.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the importance of individual factors to thromboembolic stroke (TES) risk, the authors performed a hospital-based case-control study. Ninety cases (56 men and 34 women, ages 15 to 65) discharged from the hospital between January 1981 and December 1984 with a diagnosis of TES supported by computed tomography were matched to 174 control patients (106 men and 68 women). Data on potential risk factors were obtained from the medical record and telephone interview. Using multivariate analysis, three variables were significantly associated with TES risk: hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-6.0), diabetes (OR = 4.0; 95% CI 2.0-8.3), and smoking (OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.6). The data were also analyzed using a direct risk assessment method. This analysis describes the risk in patients with any one factor compared with patients without any of the factors. The direct estimates of risk increased by 71% for hypertension (OR = 5.8), 28% for diabetes (OR = 5.1), and 90% for smoking (OR = 3.8). The authors conclude that hypertension, diabetes, and smoking are the major risk factors for TES in patients 65 years old or younger.\r"

DESIGN: Videotaped simulated CEX containing programmed resident strengths and weaknesses shown to faculty evaluators, with responses elicited using the open-ended form recommended by the ABIM followed by detailed questionnaires. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two full-time faculty internists. INTERVENTION: After the open-ended form was completed and collected, faculty members rated the resident's performance on a five-point scale and rated the importance of various aspects of the history and physical examination for the patient shown. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Very few of the resident's strengths and weaknesses were mentioned on the open-ended form, although responses to specific questions revealed that faculty members actually had observed many errors and some strengths that they had failed to document. Faculty members also displayed wide variance in the global assessment of the resident: 50% rated him marginal, 25% failed him, and 25% rated him satisfactory. Only for performance areas not directly related to the patient's problems could substantial variability be explained by disagreement on standards. CONCLUSIONS: Faculty internists vary markedly in their observations of a resident and document little. To be useful for resident feedback and evaluation, exercises such as the CEX may need to use more specific and detailed forms to document strengths and weaknesses, and faculty evaluators probably need to be trained as observers.\r"

DESIGN: Descriptive study of consecutive patients not able to obtain medical care because of financial or other barriers. Financial barriers and medical diagnoses were categorized and the severity of illness and impact of unavailability of medical services were judged by a panel of internists using consensus analysis. The likelihood of obtaining care after refusal of assistance was also evaluated. SETTING: A social services eligibility office on the grounds of an urban, university teaching hospital that serves a largely medically indigent population. PATIENTS: 200 patients who presented to eligibility workers seeking financial assistance. Interventions: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sixty percent could not obtain care because they were illegal aliens, 40% could not obtain care because they did not meet the strict criteria of the assistance programs. Sixty percent of patients had a moderate to high likelihood of long-term disability from their illnesses; 38% of a subgroup were not able to find care four weeks after entering the study, and these patients appeared to have more severe disease than those who were able to find care. CONCLUSIONS: Many medically indigent persons with significant illnesses face serious financial barriers to access to medical care.\r"

SETTING: A university family practice unit (FPU) and a large steel company (DOFASCO) in Hamilton, Ontario. PATIENTS: Participants were 107 of 125 (86%) eligible hypertensives at the two sites; 103 (96%) subjects completed the study. INTERVENTION: Subjects discontinued antihypertensive medication and were followed until blood pressure (BP) became elevated or for 12 months, whichever was shorter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: BPs were monitored according to a predefined schedule and before, during, and after mental and physical stress tests. Thirty-eight (37%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 27-46%) subjects remained normotensive at 12 months. Predictors of remaining normotensive included lower medicated standing diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (87.6 versus 91.8 mm Hg, 95% CI for the difference 2.2-6.2, p less than 0.001) and longer duration of normotension on drugs (12.6 months versus 8.7, 95% CI for the difference 0.9-6.9, p = 0.012). There was no significant relationship between maintenance of normotension and age, medication potency, duration of hypertension, weight, lying BP, change in heart rate, or BP during mental or physical stress tests; the power to detect a clinically important difference in lying DBP was 99% but for other variables was lower (21-75%). CONCLUSIONS: The probability of hypertensives' remaining normotensive for one year after drug withdrawal increases as the medicated standing DBP decreases and as the number of months of BP control while on medication increases. Studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to determine whether other variables may be significant predictors.\r"

  ".U": "89257785\r", 
  ".W": "Much has been written about the complexities of the doctor-patient relationship and the myriad ways that both parties communicate. When patients become more frail, this relationship must expand to include their family caregivers. This addition of a third person complicates the situation in more than an additive fashion. It requires more time and energy on the part of physicians that are not without costs. Balancing both patient and caregiver needs in a time-driven and increasingly competitive world is not easy. Physicians not only need better preparation to meet the challenges of caring for frail older patients, but they also need changes in reimbursement policies so that they can afford to spend the time needed to manage the complexities inherent in the doctor-patient-family caregiver relationship. Although there is uncertainty about timing of these changes, there is no uncertainty about the complexity of the doctor-patient-family caregiver relationship. To make its management easier, the following rules are worth remembering: 1. Carefully assess problems in all domains of patient function and develop plans for managing and monitoring these problems. 2. Recognize that the effects of patient disabilities cycle between patient and caregiver. 3. Pay attention to the needs and concerns of patients and of their caregivers. 4. Provide caregivers with as much information as possible and educate them about \"when to worry.\" 5. Assure caregivers that you are available to answer questions and help them with handling problems that arise in the care of their elders.\r"

X-ray diffraction of the alpha-TCP powder showed a typical pattern of TCP, whereas a mixed pattern of TCP and hydroxylapatite was obtained after hydration and hardening. The radiographic findings at 4 weeks showed a tendency to bony union of the TCP block with the underlying bone. Microscopically, new bone that was being formed extensively from the underlying bone surface and filling the space between the block and bone at 4 weeks gradually changed into lamellar bone. There was no evidence of resorption of the TCP block throughout the experiment. The tissue response was essentially consistent with that to hydroxylapatite particles studied under similar conditions in our laboratory. It was concluded that the hydration and hardening of alpha-TCP powder may provide an implant block with a desirable contour that does not interfere with bone formation.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred eight fresh tissue samples obtained from normal tissues, benign tumors, and malignant tumors of the oral and maxillofacial region were analyzed for nuclear DNA content and cell kinetics by flow cytometric analysis (FCM). Mean DNA indices for 22 normal tissues and 18 benign tumors were 1.00 and 1.02, respectively, and all samples but one showed diploid pattern. On the other hand, the value for 68 malignant tumors was 1.38, and 66% of them showed an aneuploid pattern. The S phase and G2 + M phase cell populations for malignant tumors were 17.2% and 7.0%, respectively. With the exception of G2 + M phase cell population, all values for malignant tumors were significantly higher than those of normal tissue and benign tumors. Although statistical differences were not observed in most of the values, they were higher in squamous cell carcinomas than in malignant salivary gland tumors. The incidence of aneuploidy and DNA index showed a tendency to increase with the increase of T classification, in N2 and N3 tumors, and in the group of patients with recurrence or who died. The DNA index and the type of DNA ploidy were well correlated to malignancy grade determined by six histologic parameters, whereas the S phase cell population was correlated to mitosis. The analysis by the two-dimensional diagnostic supporting system showed that more than 80% of malignant tumors can be correctly diagnosed by combined values of DNA index and S phase cell population. The results indicate that nuclear DNA analysis by FCM is quite useful as a supplement to histologic diagnosis and evaluation of malignancy grade.\r"

After microsurgery of the lingual nerve, there is a lack of regeneration of the gustatory fibers in comparison with the sensory fibers. The histologic investigation of ten human lingual nerve preparations showed that the chorda tympani fibers distribute widely in the fascicles of the lingual nerve. Therefore, after microsurgical reconstruction of the lingual nerve in the third molar region, the chance of the gustatory fibers meeting and regenerating is very low.\r"

The radiographic spectrum is similar to that of other benign fibro-osseous lesions, beginning as a radiolucent lesion and becoming more radiopaque as the involved bone becomes more sclerotic. Many benign fibro-osseous lesions demonstrate similar histologic features, and without other radiographic and clinical information, a definitive diagnosis may be impossible. The dense bone of florid osseous dysplasia is very susceptible to infection and osteomyelitis, particularly with advancing years and in response to trauma. The disease may be self-limiting as reported by many authors, but as in this case, can be symptomatic for most of the person's lifetime. This presents a diagnostic and treatment dilemma for the clinician. Although this entity has a distinct predilection for black women, more reported cases should be evaluated before the mode of inheritance can be established and before a tendency for familial cases in individuals of Italian descent can be confirmed.\r"

Analysis of these Late Neolithic artifacts indicates the presence of a number of themes associated with hallucinogen use: the presence of iconographic elements similar to eidetic forms; the use of red color; anthropo- and theriopomorphic figurines in seated postures; and specific patterns of breakage with disposal. The discussion illuminates the crucial features as well as the role and significance of these factors in ecstatic cults.\r"

Evaluations of these artistic productions were analyzed by a professor of art history in order to investigate the impact of LSD on artistic creativity. Certain representative changes were found in the artists' predominant style. The most significant change was noted in those artists whose styles were intrinsically representational or abstract to more expressionistic or nonobjective. Other changes noted included the following: relative size expansion; involution; movement; alteration of figure/ground and boundaries; greater intensity of color and light; oversimplification; symbolic and abstract depiction of objects; and fragmentation, disorganization, and distortion. Many artists judged their LSD productions to be more interesting and aesthetically superior to their usual mode of expression. The above-mentioned changes contributed to the artists' convictions that they were fashioning new meanings to an emergent world.\r"

Although some contemporary works on the !Kung and their healing ceremonies give no evidence of the use of psychoactive plants, an examination of the available biochemical and pharmacological literature on the properties of these plants indicates that most contain psychoactive or toxic substances that are likely to have trance-inducing properties. Almost half of the !Kung medicine plants contain psychoactive substances or have toxic properties, and a similarly large group of these plants has psychoactive or toxic properties in related species. Although recent reports have shown little concern with the use of psychoactive substances, the earlier literature illustrated a major concern with their use in !Kung Bushmen trance and healing. This contrast with more recent research suggests a decline in the use of psychoactive plants in the recent past. This decline is examined with respect to changes in the !Kung Bushmen society and how attitudes in the United States regarding drug use may have influenced investigators and their research reports.\r"

These perspectives reinforce the continued importance of traditional shamanistic healers in the contemporary world. This is illustrated by the activities of a Peruvian healer who utilizes both psychoactive plant substances and a syncretic combination of modern and traditional symbolic therapies. The reliance on a wide range of psychoactive plants, including both psychoactive substances and nonhallucinogenic plants, is shown to be empirically effective in the treatment of disease. This demonstrates the pragmatic and adaptive approaches of these traditional healers and their positive functions in treating a variety of illnesses in today's world.\r"

Swabs were obtained on the first day of life, twice weekly for 2 weeks, and weekly thereafter. Isolates were characterized by species, biotype, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and slime production. Over 4 weeks the percentage of infants with Staphylococcus epidermidis as the only surface coagulase-negative staphylococci rose from 11% to 100%. Predominance of a single S. epidermidis biotype increased from none to 89%. Multiple antibiotic resistance rose from 32% to 82% of isolates, and the prevalence of slime production increased from 68% to 95%. This microbiologic pattern was established by the end of the first week of life and persisted throughout the month of study. In three infants, S. epidermidis sepsis developed with organisms identical to their predominant surface isolate. We conclude that species, multiple antibiotic resistance, and slime production appear to confer a selective advantage for the surface colonization of premature newborn infants in the intensive care nursery environment. Infants so colonized may be at greater risk for subsequent infection with these strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci.\r"

No single test identified more than 66% of people with pertussis. Of those with positive serologic findings, 95% had a positive test result for IgA antibody to filamentous hemagglutinin or for IgG antibody to pertussis toxin or for both. Pertussis occurred in both immunized and unimmunized residents.

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) core antigen was assayed in the plasma of children at risk for infection with HIV to determine its usefulness in the diagnosis of infection and to correlate it with the clinical stage of disease. Antigen was detected in the plasma of all children less than 15 months of age with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two thirds of children with AIDS-related illnesses and half of children with asymptomatic infection had antigen. Although 53% of plasma specimens originating from HIV-infected children younger than 6 months of age contained antigen, only 25% of plasma specimens from children younger than 6 months who had no symptoms and none of the 10 specimens from HIV-infected newborn infants contained antigen. Half of the specimens containing core antigen also contained anticore antibody. Quantitative mean antigen levels were more likely to be elevated in children with AIDS (516 pg/ml) than in children with AIDS-related illnesses (295 pg/ml) or in those who had no symptoms (70 pg/ml). Antigen levels tended to increase over time in children with advancing clinical illness, but they tended to decrease over time after a diagnosis of AIDS was made. Antigen was detected in the plasma of 4 of 14 children without symptoms who subsequently reverted to an HIV seronegative state. We conclude that the detection of core antigen occurs with high frequency in children, even young infants, with symptomatic HIV infection. Plasma core antigen was less frequent in children without symptoms and was not detected in 10 infected children when they were tested at birth.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the hypotheses that serum calcium and blood ionized calcium would be low in acutely ill children and would rise with clinical improvement. In 15 children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, the blood ionized calcium level was 4.45 +/- 0.06 mg/dl (1.11 +/- 0.015 mmol/L) on entry versus 5.17 +/- 0.03 mg/dl (1.29 +/- 0.01 mmol/L) in control subjects (p less than 0.005), rose significantly on days 2 and 3, and was 5.12 +/- 0.04 mg/dl (1.28 +/- 0.01 mmol/L) at discharge (p less than 0.005). Changes in serum calcium level were similar, whereas serum magnesium and phosphorus levels were normal and did not change. Basal serum parathyroid hormone concentrations were elevated, rose further during the study, and were normal at discharge. Serum parathyroid hormone levels correlated inversely with blood ionized calcium levels, indicating that compensatory hyperparathyroidism occurs with low blood ionized calcium concentrations. Basal serum calcitonin values were evaluated on entry and decreased with clinical improvement. Serum calcitonin levels correlated significantly with low blood ionized calcium levels, indicating that hypercalcitoninemia may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypocalcemia in these children. Urine calcium excretion was not increased in the four children studied. We speculate that with clinical improvement, a rise in serum parathyroid hormone levels and a decline in serum calcitonin levels may help restore normocalcemia in these acutely ill children.\r"

DESIGN: Case-referent study of obese and nonobese siblings from the same kindred. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Telephone screening of community volunteers resulted in a consecutive sample of 16 kindreds. Obese and nonobese siblings were similar in age, height, and pubertal status. Significantly more female subjects were in the obese group (p less than 0.01). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Body composition studies revealed that the obese siblings had higher body fat (p less than 0.001) but that fat-free mass was similar to that of the lean siblings. Resting metabolic rates determined by indirect calorimetry for the obese and nonobese pairs did not differ. Although the obese siblings appeared less fit when maximal oxygen consumption was measured in relation to total weight, maximal oxygen consumption did not differ when values were standardized for fat-free mass. CONCLUSIONS: The obese adolescents did not have a reduced resting metabolic rate. As in adults, the relationship between resting metabolic rate and fat-free mass was similar for obese and nonobese children and adolescents. Any decreased sport participation by the obese siblings was not due to inherent reductions in aerobic capacity.\r"

We examined the relationship between plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and GH secretory profile in each patient before and during therapy with L-thyroxine. In contrast to the results of previous studies that used pharmacologic tests of GH release, spontaneous GH secretion was consistently attenuated in the hypothyroid state. Mean nocturnal GH levels were reduced by 58% (1.48 +/- 0.38 ng/ml, mean +/- SEM) in comparison with values obtained during L-thyroxine therapy (3.54 +/- 0.71 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). Coincident with the reduced levels of GH, plasma IGF-I concentrations were lower in patients before therapy (0.46 +/- 0.20 U/ml) compared with concentrations during therapy (1.50 +/- 0.34 U/ml, p less than 0.01). In treated, euthyroid patients, GH and IGF-I levels were equivalent to those of normal children. The excellent correlation (r = 0.77) between plasma IGF-I and mean nocturnal GH concentrations indicates that reduced plasma IGF-I levels in hypothyroidism probably result from suppressed GH secretion.\r"

Twenty-eight patients of southwestern origin were matched for gender, age, and diagnosis with an equal number of patients of eastern origin. The disease was diagnosed in all patients at birth, and follow-up study was done on a regular basis. Despite being born and living in the same environment (Eastern Province), patients of southwestern origin had more severe clinical features, consistently lower hemoglobin levels, and higher reticulocyte counts, suggesting more severe hemolysis. We conclude that there are at least two distinct forms of sickle cell disease in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and that the variability of the disease in early childhood is more likely related to genetic than to environmental factors.\r"

Six homozygotes were identified who had undetectable GDH activity and identical biochemical profiles (consisting of glutaric and 3-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, reduced serum carnitine concentrations, and frontotemporal atrophy). Serial computed tomographic brain scans of one homozygous infant demonstrated the sequential postnatal development of this atrophy during 3 years before the development of clinical manifestations. In three of the six homozygotes, including the father in one kindred, there were no clinical manifestations of glutaric aciduria type I. These findings raise questions about the value of prenatal diagnosis in predicting clinical manifestations in homozygous newborn infants.\r"

The antigen used was a gag-env hybrid protein constructed in vitro and expressed in Escherichia coli. This assay detected a specific antibody against HTLV-I. Four of the 18 HIV-1-negative hemophiliacs (22%) were positive for anti-HTLV-I antibody; their geometric mean titer was 951 U/ml. Seven of the 12 patients (58%) with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were positive for anti-HTLV-I antibody, and 8 of 35 HIV-1 + AIDS-free carriers (23%) were positive. The difference between the prevalence of HTLV-I infection in the two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.0297). The geometric mean titer of antibody in the patients with AIDS was 318 U/ml and that for the HIV-1 + AIDS-free carriers was 1,496 U/ml. These findings suggest that HTLV-I infection could be one of the factors in the development of AIDS in individuals infected with HIV-I.\r"

The percent free of the R was greater than that of the S for most subjects, but the ratio of percent unbound R to S ranged from 0.52 to 1.33. In extensive studies with a single representative plasma, the percent unbound of the individual enantiomers was independent of concentration up to 26 micrograms/ml, although the binding of the S enantiomer (0.048 +/- 0.007%) was greater than that of the R (0.082 +/- 0.017%), whereas that of the racemate (0.065 +/- 0.028%) was intermediate. At supratherapeutic concentrations of the enantiomers, the percent free of both R- and S-flurbiprofen increased to 0.252 at 100 micrograms/ml. A one-site binding model with nonspecific binding described the data well for R-, S- and racemic flurbiprofen; resulting Ka values were 3.39 X 10(6), 7.31 X 10(6) and 4.35 X 10(6) M-1, respectively. The binding of each enantiomer in the presence of varying amounts of its antipode was described best by a simple competitive inhibition model where mutual displacement occurred as concentrations increased beyond 26 micrograms/ml. The binding of racemic flurbiprofen in elderly and obese volunteers and patients with liver disease was not significantly different from normal subjects, but binding was less in hypoalbuminemic patients and patients with renal impairment. Uremia decreased the binding of R-flurbiprofen preferentially.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted in the isolated perfused rat kidney to determine the mechanism of unsurmountable antagonism by metergoline toward the vasoconstrictor response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Three possible mechanisms were investigated: 1) multiple receptors for 5-HT; 2) pseudoirreversible inhibition; and 3) allosteric modulation of 5-HT receptors. Metergoline and six other 5-HT antagonists acted as potent unsurmountable antagonists, only (-)-propranolol acted competitively (pA2 = 6.5). Multiple receptors for 5-HT were ruled out as the mechanism of unsurmountable antagonism because 5-HT and four 5-HT analogs gave similar pA2 values with (-)-propranolol. In addition, the KA value for 5-HT (185 nM) and the order and relativity of agonist potency suggest the presence of a single 5-HT2 receptor. Pseudoirreversible inhibition, over allosteric modulation of the 5-HT2 receptor, is suggested from experiments in which reversal of metergoline-induced inhibition by (-)-propranolol (studied in the presence of metergoline) was matched, in magnitude, by wash-out of metergoline. (-)-Propranolol is suggested to mimic wash-out by occupying and protecting receptors from which metergoline has dissociated. This is accomplished by virtue of its faster kinetics, on-off the 5-HT receptor, allowing restoration of 5-HT responses via a competitive interaction. Pseudoirreversible antagonism, over allosteric receptor modulation, offers an explanation that does not involve the postulation of allosteric effector sites or changes in the state of the 5-HT2 receptor.\r"

Cysteamine was administered to mice to evaluate its effects upon immune organ size and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses in relation to corresponding effects on the immunomodulatory hormones, prolactin and corticosterone. The lowest dose of cysteamine, 12.5 mg/kg given once per day for 3 consecutive days, produced significant elevations of both concanavalin A-(Con A) and lipopolysaccharide-induced blastogenesis. Serum prolactin levels were also significantly elevated with 12.5 mg/kg cysteamine. By contrast, at 300 and 400 mg/kg, cysteamine significantly reduced Con A and lipopolysaccharide-induced proliferation. This suppression of mitogen-induced proliferative responses was accompanied by marked atrophy of the thymus. Levels of both prolactin and corticosterone in the serum were significantly reduced at 400 mg/kg cysteamine. A positive correlation was observed between serum prolactin levels and Con A-induced proliferation as well as between serum prolactin and corticosterone levels in cysteamine-treated mice. The immunomodulatory effects of cysteamine were not limited to correlative effects on neuroendocrine parameters. A similar pattern of effects was observed following in vitro administration of cysteamine. Low concentrations in vitro (0.1 mM) stimulated Con A-induced proliferation of normal mouse splenocytes, and higher concentrations in vitro (2.0 mM) suppressed proliferation. These studies indicate that, depending upon the dose, cysteamine has bidirectional effects on mitogen-induced proliferation of lymphocytes; these effects are correlated with cysteamine-related alterations in the neuroendocrine status of the animal but may also be observed with direct addition of the drug to stimulated lymphocytes in culture.\r"

Infusion of SK&F 104353 at various rates revealed that a steady-state plasma concentration of 0.125 microM (0.06 micrograms/ml) reduced LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction by 60%. In addition to preventing the response to LTD4, i.v. administered SK&F 104353 (10 mumol/kg) rapidly and completely reversed ongoing LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction. SK&F 104353 also was effective when given intraduodenally 1 hr before LTD4 challenge, although the ID50 (32 mumol/kg) was 60-fold greater than the i.v. ID50. Given intragastrically, 100 mumol/kg of SK&F 104353 abolished the response to LTD4 for 1 hr, and reduced the response for 6 hr. SK&F 104353 (20 mumol/kg i.v.) had no effect on the bronchoconstriction induced by aerosolized acetylcholine, histamine or U-44069, but did antagonize the response to LTC4. SK&F 104353 alone did not produce bronchoconstriction when administered by any route or dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Marijuana has been reported to be an effective antinauseant and antiemetic in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Whether this is due to psychological changes, central antiemetic properties and/or direct effects on gastrointestinal (GI) function is not known. The purpose of these investigations was to determine whether the major constituents of marijuana and the synthetic cannabinoid nabilone have any effects on GI function which can be detected in rodent models of GI transit and motility. Intravenous delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) slowed the rate of gastric emptying and small intestinal transit in mice and in rats. Delta 9,11-THC, cannabinol and nabilone given i.v. also inhibited small intestinal transit in mice, but were less effective in reducing gastric emptying. Cannabidiol given i.v. had no effect on gastric emptying or intestinal transit. Those cannabinoids which inhibited GI transit did so at doses equal to, or lower, than those reported to produce central nervous system activity. In rats, delta 9-THC produced greater inhibition of gastric emptying and small intestinal transit than large bowel transit, indicating a selectivity for the more proximal sections of the gut. In addition, i.v. delta 9-THC decreased the frequency of both gastric and intestinal contractions without altering intraluminal pressure. Such changes probably reflect a decrease in propulsive activity, without change in basal tone. These data indicate that delta 9-THC, delta 9,11-THC, cannabinol and nabilone (but not cannabidiol) exert an inhibitory effect on GI transit and motility in rats.\r"

Thirty-six to 48 hr after treatment, BCNU also inhibited the biliary excretion of an i.v. bolus of indocyanine green (24 mg/kg) by 75 to 85%. This suggested that inhibition of glutathione-S-transferase activity was not the main site of action of BCNU in its interference with cholephilic dye excretion. Indeed, it was found that conjugation of BSP with reduced glutathione (GSH) mediated by liver cytosol isolated from BCNU-pretreated rats was unaltered. In addition, BCNU did not deplete hepatic GSH. On the contrary, the hepatic concentration of GSH was increased by 60% 48 hr after treatment with BCNU. Thus, the ability of BCNU to block BSP excretion is probably not due to decreased conjugation of BSP with GSH. Inhibition of excretion under the saturating conditions of constant infusion strongly suggests an effect on canalicular excretion.\r"

In the current experiments, HOT and COLD mice were found to differ significantly in sensitivity to EtOH-induced HT across a range of doses: the difference was greater at higher doses. After 3 g/kg of EtOH, HOT mice displayed a 1.8 degrees C HT, whereas COLD mice had a 3.6 degrees C HT. Male mice had greater HT responses than female mice regardless of genotype. Nonselected control mice were intermediate to the HOT and COLD mice in responsiveness to EtOH. After an acute EtOH dose, HOT mice were found to have slightly lower brain EtOH concentrations than COLD mice 3 and 4 (but not 1 and 2) hr after administration of EtOH, and may have eliminated EtOH slightly more rapidly than COLD mice. When tested repeatedly in a cool ambient environment (18 degrees C), COLD mice developed tolerance to EtOH hypothermia, whereas HOT mice did not. These results confirm that sensitivity to the hypothermic effects of EtOH is influenced markedly by genotype. Furthermore, selection for neurosensitivity to EtOH has produced a correlated difference in rate or magnitude of tolerance development, which is consistent with an hypothesis of the influence of common genes determining these responses to EtOH. The difference in tolerance could not be accounted for by initial HT sensitivity differences between the lines. The HOT and COLD lines should be useful for studies of the neurobiological mechanisms of EtOH-induced HT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that the delta agonist, [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) and the putative endogenous kappa agonist, dynorphin A-(1-17) could differentially modulate the effects of a group of chemically diverse mu agonists was evaluated using inhibition of volume-induced contractions of the rat urinary bladder as a model of central nervous system opioid receptor function in vivo. Intracerebroventricular administration of equieffective doses of the mu agonists [D-Ala2, NMPhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), [N-MePhe3, D-Pro4]enkephalin (PL017), morphine, normorphine, sufentanil, etorphine, phenazocine, meperidine and methadone inhibited spontaneous bladder contractions for approximately 20 to 30 min. Low doses of DPDPE or dynorphin A-(1-17) failed to affect spontaneous bladder contractions; higher doses of DPDPE (greater than 15.5 nmol) and dynorphin A-(1-17) (i.e., greater than 3.7 nmol), inhibited bladder contractions. When coadministered i.c.v., DPDPE displaced the morphine dose-response line to the left and also potentiated the effects of normorphine and etorphine. In contrast, DPDPE failed to alter the actions of equieffective doses of DAGO, PL017, meperidine, methadone, phenazocine or sufentanil. The potentiation of the effects of morphine by DPDPE were prevented by i.c.v. coadministration of the delta antagonist, ICI 174,864 (N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH); at the dose tested, the delta antagonist had no agonist effects alone and did not antagonize the effects of morphine directly. Furthermore, the agonist effects of morphine were potentiated by several different doses of DPDPE. Administration of i.c.v. dynorphin A-(1-17) produced a rightward displacement of the morphine dose-response line and also antagonized the effects of normorphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Glandular kallikrein is known to promote contractions of the isolated, estrogenized rat uterus, perhaps independently of kinin formation. The recent availability of kinin receptor antagonists led us to study whether they might affect the oxytocic activity of kallikrein. DArg0-Hyp3-Thi5,8-DPhe7-bradykinin (8.5 x 10(-7) M) displaced the dose-response curves to both bradykinin (from 1.0 x 10(-9) to 4.0 x 10(-6) M) and kallikrein (from 4.7 x 10(-11) to 8.0 x 10(-9) M) approximately one order of magnitude to the right. This inhibition could not be due to a nonspecific effect on the uterine muscle, as the contractile response to oxytocin was not altered. In addition, carboxypeptidase B (a potent kininase) and kinin antibodies reduced the contractile response to kallikrein by 70 and 60%, respectively. Removal of the intervening agent restored the normal response. The effect of kallikrein depended on its enzymatic activity, inasmuch as kallikrein inactivated with D-Phe-Arg-Arg-CH2Cl was not oxytocic. Prolonged or multiple exposures to kallikrein completely abolished uterine response, whereas the effect of bradykinin was unaltered. Uterine horns rendered insensitive to kallikrein by prolonged exposure still contracted in response to trypsin. Kininogen was present in the uterine tissue in a concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.3 ng of bradykinin equivalents per mg wet wt. No more than 15.9 +/- 1.2% of this total was due to plasma contamination. Only 21.5 +/- 2.9% of total kininogen could be cleaved by kallikrein. We conclude that part of the oxytocic activity of kallikrein is related to generation of kinins from a kallikrein-sensitive kininogen present in the isolated rat uterus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was designed to determine if the cytoplasmic amine storage granule was the site for storage and release of atenolol and if the drug was, in fact, an enantiomeric selective substrate for the vesicular amine transport protein. Uptake of racemic [3H]atenolol and (-)-[3H]norepinephrine was studied in a vesicular preparation of storage granules isolated from PC12 cells. Uptake of both molecules was found to be ATP-dependent (80%) and to reach steady state in approximately 10 to 15 min. Uptake and storage was inhibited (95%) by either reserpine, an inhibitor of the vesicular amine carrier, or by nigericin which dissipates the proton gradient across the membrane. Uptake of neither compound was inhibited by desipramine, an inhibitor of uptake 1, or oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase. Furthermore, uptake of the (-)-enantiomer of atenolol was found to be approximately 5-fold greater than the (+)-enantiomer. Kinetic studies revealed a Km of 184 microM for (+/-)-atenolol and 79 microM for (-)-norepinephrine and Vmax values of 750 and 503 pmol/min/mg of protein for atenolol and norepinephrine, respectively. The interaction of the two compounds with the transport process was found to be kinetically competitive. In separate experiments, atenolol was also found to be transported stereoselectively into bovine adrenal chromaffin granule ghosts and to be ATP dependent (85%) and reserpine sensitive (44%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Acyclovir-associated renal dysfunction is difficult to study in humans because it occurs in patient populations who are generally receiving multiple medicines concurrently and dysfunctions occur infrequently. We studied the effects of two regimens of acyclovir treatment, a short-term high dose (210 mg/kg/day for 43 hr) via constant infusion and a chronic lower dose by intermittent infusion (15 mg/kg, 3 times/day for 28 days), on selected renal functions in dogs. Urine concentrating capacity as compared to base-line and controls declined during both the short-term (40% decline) and chronic treatments (36% decline). The persistence of the concentrating deficit in the presence of stimulation with vasopressin suggested that the defect resided in the renal response to vasopressin. Glomerular filtration rates significantly decreased during the acute high-dose treatment (from 104 +/- 15 to 87 +/- 11 ml/min) but not during the chronic low-dose treatment. Both acyclovir treatments were associated with a small but significant decline (approximately 10% for both studies) in the plasma potassium concentrations although an increase in urine potassium clearance could not be demonstrated. We conclude that acyclovir can cause renal dysfunction in healthy animals at plasma concentrations higher but comparable to those achieved clinically. Although both treatment regimens decreased renal function, the shorter high-dose regimen which maintained acyclovir plasma concentrations was more detrimental than the longer exposure to a lower dose of the drug given intermittently. The data suggest that renal dysfunction is not related to a rare sensitivity, as all acyclovir-treated animals showed subtle decrements in renal function.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of protein kinases in agonist-mediated beta-2 adrenergic receptor regulation, the effects of the protein kinase A and C inhibitor, H-7 [1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine], on isoproterenol-induced beta adrenoceptor activation and desensitization have been studied in intact human lymphocytes. In the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, H-7 potentiated 10(-8) to 10(-4) M isoproterenol or prostaglandin E1-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. We failed to observe any effect of H-7 on forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. These effects of H-7 are probably not due to its inhibition of phosphodiesterase. In addition, whereas up to 10(-3) M H-7 had no beta adrenergic receptor blocking effect, preincubation of intact cells with 10(-3.5) M H-7 partially prevented 50 nM isoproterenol-induced beta-2 adrenergic receptor desensitization in terms of decreases in beta adrenoceptor density (maximum binding), isoproterenol-mediated cAMP responsiveness and high affinity receptor binding for agonist. Interestingly, 10(-3.5) M H-7 alone treated cells also showed an up-regulation of cell surface beta receptor density (maximum binding) and increased cAMP responsiveness to isoproterenol stimulation. The mechanisms are unclear. If these effects occur as a result of inhibition by H-7 of protein kinase A and/or C, it may suggest an important role of protein kinase A and/or C in agonist-induced beta-2 adrenergic receptor regulation.\r"

In these experiments, the effects of paralytic intrathecal doses of AVP on rat brain and spinal cord blood flow, vascular resistance and cardiac output were measured using radiolabeled microspheres. Ten minutes after injection, AVP (10-100 pmol) elevated mean arterial pressures significantly, increased vascular resistances in thoracic and lumbosacral spinal cord and reduced blood flow to the lumbosacral spinal cord without altering cardiac output, total peripheral resistance and blood flow to brain and other spinal cord regions. Lumbosacral blood flows remained significantly reduced 30 min after injection of 100 pmol of AVP, and recovered to pretreatment base-line levels by 60 min postinjection. Lactic acid concentrations were elevated significantly in spinal cerebrospinal fluid samples removed 5 to 15 min after AVP injection (100 pmol). The selective AVP V1 receptor antagonist [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid), 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine] arg8-vasopressin, which previously blocked the effects of AVP on hindlimb motor and nociceptive function, in these experiments also blocked the AVP-induced increases in arterial pressure and reductions in lumbosacral perfusion. Intravenous infusion of the vasodilators papaverine and nifedipine failed to block AVP-induced hindlimb paralysis. Nifedipine, however, did accelerate subsequent recovery of hindlimb motor function, although it did not alter the lumbosacral blood flow reductions measured at 10 and 30 min after AVP injection. These findings indicate that AVP has significant vascular effects in the rat spinal cord that are associated with ischemia and neurological dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results of these analyses indicated that: 1) conversion of R-(-)- to S-(+)-ibuprofen takes place with complete retention of deuterium at the beta-methyl (C-3) position; 2) chiral inversion of R-(-)-[2H3]ibuprofen is not subject to a discernible deuterium isotope effect; and 3) replacement of the beta-methyl hydrogen atoms by deuterium has no effect on any of the serum pharmacokinetic parameters for R-(-)- or S-(+)-ibuprofen.

In order to compare the time dependence of the EFS-induced relaxation with that of the elevation of cyclic GMP, the ability of EFS to produce relaxation and increase cyclic GMP was measured. The results of these experiments showed that cyclic GMP content increased before the onset of relaxation. Cumulative addition of atriopeptin II, an activator of particulate guanylate cyclase, produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of this tissue and increased cyclic GMP content. In other experiments, zaprinast, an inhibitor of a cyclic GMP selective-phosphodiesterase, produced a concentration-related relaxation of opossum LES and increased cyclic GMP content. However, pretreatment with zaprinast (3 microM) did not potentiate the EFS-induced relaxation or the increase in cyclic GMP content. At this concentration, however, zaprinast increased the basal content of cyclic GMP. Finally, 8-Br-cyclic GMP, a membrane-permeable analog of cyclic GMP, produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated strips of opossum LES. In conclusion, these data extend the initial findings that an elevation in cyclic GMP content is associated with relaxation and suggest that cyclic GMP is a potential intracellular messenger of neurally- and drug-induced relaxation of opossum LES.\r"

Oxygen consumption (QO2) was used as an index of transcellular transport and provided a continuous dynamic record of the tubules' response to an agonist. Both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists produced a linear dose-related increase in QO2 at a steeper slope than the control in proximal and distal nephron segments. Stimulation of QO2 by the adrenergic agonists did not occur in the presence of ouabain and did not exceed the maximal respiratory rate achieved with nystatin. The response was determined to be a receptor-mediated increase in the ouabain-sensitive component of respiration. An inactive stereoisomer of epinephrine produced no effect, and adrenergic antagonists inhibited the stimulation by the respective agonists. Adrenergic agonists stimulated QO2 in proximal segments to a much greater degree than observed with suspensions of distal segments. These results are consistent with the density of adrenoceptors on nephrons reported in radioligand binding and autoradiographic studies. The alpha-1 agonists, cirazoline and phenylephrine, had similar dose-response curves and stimulated proximal tubules more than distal tubules. The alpha-2 agonists, guanabenz, UK 14,304 and B-HT 933, equivalently stimulated QO2 in distal tubules, but a spectrum of enhanced oxygen consumption was observed in proximal nephrons. Although both alpha adrenoceptor subtypes increased QO2 in proximal and distal nephrons, the mechanisms are likely to be different.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported the presence of a 5-HT1 (serotonin)-like receptor coupled in an inhibitory manner to adenylate cyclase in the opossum kidney cell line, which is derived from the kidney of a North American opossum. Pharmacological data from binding and cyclic AMP production studies indicate that this receptor does not have characteristics of a 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C or 5-HT1D receptor, but is similar to 5-HT1B receptors found in rodent tissues. Many serotonergic drugs, including 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyrindinyl)1H-indol, 5-HT and methysergide, but not (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide or buspirone, were full agonists at this receptor as defined by the inhibition of bovine parathyroid hormone peptide fragment 1-34-stimulated cyclic AMP production in an intact cell assay. Several classical beta adrenergic antagonists including propranolol and cyanopindolol were also full agonists at this receptor. Radioligand binding studies using [125I](-)-iodocyanopindolol gave a Bmax of 88 fmol/mg of protein and a KD of 47 pM for saturation experiments carried out in the presence of GTP. In the absence of GTP, the binding data were significantly better fit by a two-site model with KD values of 10 and 345 pM. Inhibition binding experiments were consistent with the results of the cyclic AMP experiments. The identification of 5-HT1B receptors in a tissue derived from the opossum kidney suggests that these receptors may be distributed more widely than previously thought, inasmuch as other studies have found them only in neuronal tissues of rodents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In vitro bioassays included the guinea pig ileum, mouse vas deferens and rabbit vas deferens. In vivo tests included hotplate antinociception and gastrointestinal transit inhibition, performed in mice. In vitro, all six derivatives were competitive, highly selective mu antagonists (pA2 values from 6.4-7.9). The compounds demonstrated varying degrees of intrinsic agonist activity especially in the mouse vas deferens, the least active being CTAP and D-Tic-CTAP, which showed no mu or kappa agonist actions, and delta activity only at very high (greater than 3 microM) concentrations. In vivo, none of these compounds showed antinociceptive actions when administered i.c.v. in mice. All were competitive mu antagonists in the hotplate antinociception test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A. Despite the diverse nature of the protective agents, a feature commonly associated with protection was the ability to impair hepatic uptake of 51Cr-labeled sheep erythrocytes, a function of hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells). In addition, several of the protective agents are known to affect other aspects of reticuloendothelial cell function. Therefore it seems likely that the hepatic macrophage is involved in the observed protection, although by what mechanism(s) is unknown. The most remarkable prophylaxis was seen with a single injection of Trypan red, which provided nonimmunologic protection against a lethal dose of a cyanobacterial toxin, cyanoginosin-LR, for periods up to 3 months.\r"

  ".W": "We characterized the pharmacokinetic interaction between nifedipine and ethanol as a function of route of administration with pharmacokinetic monitoring of both compounds. Nifedipine was infused (8.5 micrograms/min/kg) for 9 hr either i.a. or intraportally to assess the extent of hepatic first-pass metabolism of nifedipine in the rat. Nifedipine clearance and volume of distribution were similar for both routes of administration. Thus, hepatic first-pass metabolism of nifedipine was apparently negligible in our animal preparation. The pharmacokinetics of ethanol were also examined in the animal preparation in order to design a suitable ethanol dosing protocol for the interaction study. The apparent ethanol Vmax and volume of distribution were 1.85 +/- 0.25 mg/min and 723 +/- 91 ml/kg (mean +/- S.D.), respectively. The pharmacokinetic interaction between nifedipine and ethanol was assessed by the following protocol: nifedipine was infused (either i.a. or intraportally) for 9 hr. When nifedipine concentrations reached steady-state at 4 hr, a bolus dose of ethanol (2.0 g/kg) was administered, followed by ethanol infusion (1.85 mg/min). Constant concentrations of ethanol were obtained with this dosing protocol. Nifedipine clearance was decreased by 49% in the presence of blood ethanol concentrations of 2.5 to 2.7 mg/ml, after either route of administration. The volume of distribution of nifedipine was not changed. The ethanol concentrations observed with nifedipine coinfusion were similar to the ethanol concentrations predicted by the ethanol pharmacokinetic parameters. Thus, ethanol altered nifedipine pharmacokinetics in the rat, but not vice versa.\r"

  ".U": "89258450\r", 
  ".W": "Neural regulation of electrolyte transport in mouse jejunum was investigated in vitro using: 1) a full-thickness intestinal segment (intact preparation) and 2) a mucosal preparation, consisting of only mucosa, basement membrane and muscularis mucosa. In Ussing chambers, intact tissues exhibited high- and low-frequency oscillations of basal transmural potential difference (PD) and short-circuit current (Isc), whereas mucosal tissues exhibited only low-frequency oscillation of these parameters. High-frequency oscillations of PD and Isc were found to originate from muscle activity. Under basal conditions, intact tissues exhibited net Na+ absorption and net Cl- secretion, whereas mucosal tissues displayed greater net Na+ absorption and net Cl- absorption. When applied to the serosal medium of intact tissues, tetrodotoxin, a neurotoxin, and chlorisondamine, a ganglionic blocking agent, caused a concentration-dependent reduction of basal PD and Isc, whereas atropine produced no significant effect; these agents were without effect in mucosal tissues. Furthermore, in intact tissues, tetrodotoxin caused significant increases in net Na+ absorption and net residual flux, attaining values that were comparable to those seen in mucosal tissues. Carbachol, a muscarinic agonist, and 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperizinium, a ganglionic stimulant, elicited concentration-dependent, transient increases of basal PD and Isc when applied to the serosal medium of intact tissues; in mucosal preparations, carbachol elicited greater changes of basal PD and Isc, whereas 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperizinium produced no significant effect. In intact tissues, Isc responses elicited by carbachol were antagonized by atropine, but not tetrodotoxin or chlorisondamine; Isc responses induced by 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperizinium, however, were blocked by tetrodotoxin or chlorisondamine, but not atropine. These results support the existence of a multisynaptic, and tonically active neural pathway which serves to limit intestinal Na+ transport at some point below the maximal absorptive capacity of the mucosa. Furthermore, cholinergic muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are present in distinct neural pathways that influence intestinal electrolyte transport in the small intestine of the mouse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Biological assays were performed on intact isolated fat cells while radioligand binding studies were carried out with [3H]yohimbine in membranes. These pharmacological studies brought: 1) a critical definition of the limits of the experimental conditions required for the exploration of alpha-2 adrenergic responsiveness on human fat cells and membranes; 2) an improvement in the pharmacological definition of the human fat cell postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptor. Among alpha-2 agonists, UK-14,304 was the most potent and the relative order of potency was: UK-14,304 greater than p-aminoclonidine greater than clonidine = B-HT 920 greater than rilmenidine. For alpha-2 antagonists, the potency order was: yohimbine greater than idazoxan greater than SK&F-86,466 much greater than benextramine; 3) a description of the impact of benextramine (irreversible alpha-1/alpha-2 antagonist) on human fat cell alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and on human fat cell function; the drug inactivates the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors with a minor impact on beta adrenergic receptors and without noticeable alterations of fat cell function as assessed by preservation of beta adrenergic and Al-adenosine receptor-mediated lipolytic responses; and 4) a definition of the relationship existing between alpha-2 adrenergic receptor occupancy, inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and antilipolysis with full and partial agonists. The existence of a receptor reserve must be taken into account when evaluating alpha-2 adrenergic receptor distribution and regulation of human fat cells.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to develop a model for the relationship between concentration and anticonvulsant effect of phenobarbital in the rat. The method of quantitating the anticonvulsant response on the basis of plasma pentylenetetrazol threshold concentrations, was optimized by application of a longitudinal study design. The pharmacokinetics of phenobarbital were studied in a separate set of rats (elimination half-life 11 +/- 2 hr). The anticonvulsant effect was measured 1 hr after i.v. administration. Concentration-effect relationships were assessed for serum (total and free), cerebrospinal fluid and brain concentrations on the basis of the sigmoid maximum effect model. The EC50 for total serum was 76 +/- 9 mg/l and for free serum, cerebrospinal fluid and brain 44 +/- 5, 43 +/- 7 and 50 +/- 8 mg/l and mg/kg, respectively (means +/- S.E.). The maximum effect was about 120 mg/l of pentylenetrazol. The respective EC50 ratios corresponded closely with the concentration ratios between the different compartments as determined by orthogonal regression analysis. For the greater part of the concentration range the concentration-effect relationship also could be fitted accurately to a simple linear model. Such relationships were not perturbed by the occurrence of seizures as these did not alter the distribution profile of phenobarbital. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of p-hydroxyphenobarbital, the main metabolite of phenobarbital, also were investigated. This compound is eliminated very rapidly and has neither anticonvulsant activity of its own nor influences the anticonvulsant effect of phenobarbital at serum concentrations up to 30 mg/l. The described experimental strategies allow the study of factors influencing the concentration-anticonvulsant effect relationship of phenobarbital.\r"

However, it is still a matter of debate whether these drugs gain access to the central nervous system upon systemic administration. In this study in rats we investigated the ability of p.o. applied CE inhibitors to penetrate from blood into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by analyzing the inhibition of CE activity in the CSF after acute bolus and after 1 week overnight treatment with enalapril, ramipril and Hoe 288. Penetration into the CSF closely paralleled the lipid solubility of the drugs. The most lipophilic drug, Hoe 288 (10 mg/kg), inhibited CE activity in the CSF after acute (66%) and after chronic (30%) p.o. treatment. Ramipril (10 mg/kg), being less lipophilic than Hoe 288, was only effective after acute bolus administration (59% inhibition), whereas the most hydrophilic drug, enalapril (30 mg/kg), did not reduce CE activity in the CSF after either regimen. The CE inhibition in the CSF after acute p.o. treatment with ramipril and Hoe 288 was dose-dependent with threshold doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg (ramipril) and less than 1 mg/kg (Hoe 288). The presence of ramipril and Hoe 288 in the CSF was also demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of heat-inactivated CSF from CE inhibitor-treated rats on purified CE from rabbit lung. A comparison of the in vitro activities of the three prodrugs and their parent diacids against CE in plasma and in CSF and against purified CE revealed hydrolysis of the prodrugs to their parent diacids in plasma and CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess the electrophysiologic changes which correlated with enhanced antiarrhythmic activity during treatment with the monotherapies and this combination. Twenty-seven dogs with inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) late after ischemic injury were treated with mexiletine and quinidine, alone and in combination. Conscious but sedated animals were assigned randomly to receive serial drug treatments. Sustained VT was consistently inducible during serial placebo studies. In 13 dogs who received all four drug treatments (mexiletine, quinidine, combination and placebo) significantly greater antiarrhythmic efficacy was seen with combination therapy (8 of 13) than was seen with mexiletine alone (1 of 13), quinidine alone (3 of 13) and saline (0 of 13) (P less than .005). This enhanced antiarrhythmic activity was paralleled by greater prolongation of intraventricular conduction to the border zone and increase in excitability threshold at the border zone and increase in ventricular effective refractory period in the infarct zone. Serum concentrations of quinidine were 19 +/- 5 microM when given alone and 15 +/- 5 microM when given in combination. Mexiletine concentrations were 3.6 microM when given alone and 4.2 microM when given in combination. In conclusion, mexiletine and quinidine in combination produced enhanced antiarrhythmic activity which was paralleled by electrophysiologic changes occurring in the perinfarct zone. These electrophysiologic changes appear to be correlates of enhanced antiarrhythmic activity.\r"
