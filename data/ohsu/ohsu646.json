  ".W": "To assess the meaning of hospital-associated death rates, we studied whether mortality within 30 days of hospital admission (30-day mortality) is more informative than inpatient mortality and whether detailed assessment of additional discharge diagnoses helps in understanding death rates. We examined hospitalizations for elderly Medicare patients with principal diagnoses of stroke, bacterial pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure; these conditions account for 30.8% of Medicare 30-day mortality. Average hospital stays for these conditions were 99.0% longer, and inpatient mortality was 25.0% higher in New York than in California, but 30-day mortality was 1.6% higher in California. We conclude that inpatient death rates depend on length-of-stay patterns and give a biased picture of mortality. Additional diagnoses such as shock and pneumonia were strongly associated with increased mortality, but Medicare data do not reveal which patients had these conditions at the time of admission. Recorded diagnoses of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and osteoarthritis were commonly associated with reduced risk of death; such reduced risk is not clinically plausible. Several lines of evidence suggest that chronic disorders are underreported for patients with life-threatening disorders. We recommend great caution in using discharge diagnoses of comorbid conditions to adjust hospital death rates for clinical differences in the patient populations.\r"

The Physician Payment Review Commission, under a congressional mandate, has endorsed the general concept of a fee schedule based on resource costs for physician payment under Medicare. In this overview article, we present the policy context in which the RBRVS may play a role and describe the approach taken to develop this scale, specifically consultation with clinicians, researchers, and insurers and data gathering, including a national survey of physicians. We discuss underlying elements that are necessary to constructing an RBRVS, each of which is described more fully in subsequent articles: measuring the work (intraservice work) of performing medical services and procedures, estimating preservice and postservice work, comparing work across specialties, measuring practice costs, extrapolating from surveyed services, and establishing an RBRVS for evaluation/management services and for invasive procedures. Overall results are presented in a companion article.\r"

Because data measuring work inputs for nonsurveyed services presently are unavailable, we devised an extrapolation method that makes use of available charge data without building their inherent distortions into the extrapolated scale. To neutralize the effect of these distortions, we used small, homogeneous families of services as the basic units for the extrapolations and assumed that charges are reasonable indicators of relative work within such families. To produce extrapolated work values within each family, we multiplied an estimate of work based on survey data for a benchmark procedure by charge-based ratios that represent the relationships between surveyed and nonsurveyed services. These extrapolations can be used in constructing a Resource-Based Relative Value Scale.\r"

We present resource-based relative values for selected services in each of the 18 specialties we studied. We found that preservice and postservice work represents close to 50% of total work for invasive services and 33% of total work for evaluation/management services. We also found that the work per unit time (a measure of intensity) for invasive services is about three times that of evaluation/management. We developed a simple model and simulated an RBRVS-based fee schedule for the Medicare program under a \"budget-neutral\" assumption. Results for 30 commonly performed services show that office visit fees for evaluation/management services could rise by 70%, while some surgical fees could drop by 60%. We also simulated what the Medicare outlays would have been in 1986 for categories of medical services under an RBRVS-based fee schedule. We found that total Medicare payments for evaluation/management services would have increased by about 56%. Invasive, imaging, and laboratory services would have decreased by 42%, 30%, and 5%, respectively. We also discuss implementation issues related to an RBRVS-based fee schedule, such as the determination of a monetary conversion factor, practice costs, billing codes, and the need to evaluate the potential impacts of an RBRVS-based payment system on the cost and quality of health care.\r"

A test instrument developed by the Delphi method was administered before and after the interventions (mean, five journal club sessions). By self-report, 86% of the house staff in the journal club group improved their reading habits vs 0% in the control group. Knowledge scores increased more in the journal club group than in the control group, and a trend was found toward more knowledge gained as more sessions were attended. Ability to appraise critically a test article increased slightly in each group, but there was no significant difference between the groups. We conclude that a journal club is a powerful motivator of critical house-staff reading behavior and can help teach epidemiology and biostatistics to physicians-in-training.\r"

After the introduction of cyclosporine therapy, 41 more patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were treated with liver transplantation from 1980 to June 1987. The one-year survival is 73.2%, and, after one to three years, 28 (68%) of the recipients are living. Of the 35 patients in the combined old and new series who lived for six months or longer, only two returned to alcohol abuse. Social and vocational rehabilitation has been the rule in these recipients who were selected primarily because of urgency of need, because they or their families insisted on treatment, and because they and their families thereby committed themselves to long-standing programs of alcoholism care.\r"

MoAb Cc1 reacted with 9 of 16 circulating IgMk MoRFs tested, and MOAb Lc1 with four of the remaining. Using indirect immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques, we could identify the same cross-reactive idiotype of the serum MoRF in the renal biopsy specimens from 11 of 13 patients with EMC glomerulonephritis. Kidney specimens from the three patients, whose MoRF was not recognized by MoAbs Cc1 and Lc1, were negative. Two out of 30 control renal biopsies from patients with other forms of glomerulonephritis were shown to contain idiotype (Cc1 and Lc1) positive material. Both patients had serum polyclonal RF which could account for this finding. In conclusion, our results provide direct evidence that serum cryo-MoRF participate in the formation of glomerular immune deposits and, presumably, in the pathogenesis of renal damage in EMC glomerulonephritis.\r"

Recently a new aspiration biopsy technique has been developed to permit such analysis in patients which can be safely and repetitively performed. The clinical utility of such a technique has been tested utilizing a randomized prospective trial in which an aspirate was obtained every other day from the third post-operative day until discharge. Analysis included examination of adequacy criteria and the capacity of pathologic diagnosis to corroborate clinical diagnosis from coded specimens. Ninety-six aspirates from 21 consenting transplant recipients were obtained and analyzed. In 94 instances a clinical diagnosis could be made; 80 aspirates fulfilled adequacy criteria. We found the technique to be highly sensitive (greater than or equal to 90%) and highly specific (greater than or equal to 90%) for the clinical diagnoses of acute allograft rejection, post-operative acute renal failure, cyclosporine toxicity, and normal function. We conclude that the fine needle aspiration technique is an important adjunct to analysis of clinical renal transplantation and offers a major advantage to the clinical scholar in understanding transplant biology.\r"

Thus there were gradual changes in the fractional tubular secretion of creatinine in individual patients, in both directions. Owing to these changes, measurements of creatinine clearance gave erroneous impressions of the rate or existence of progression during all or a portion of the period of observation in nearly half of these patients. In the 22 studies as a group, using the entire periods of observation, b1 indicated significantly more rapid progression (by 0.18 +/- 0.06 ml/min/month, P less than 0.01) than did b2, and had a significantly greater variance. Measurements of progression based on the rate of change of reciprocal plasma creatinine (multiplied by an average rate of urinary creatinine excretion in each study) were equally misleading, even though less variable. We conclude that sequential creatinine measurements are often misleading as measures of progression and should, when feasible, be replaced by urinary clearance of isotopes in following patients with chronic renal failure.\r"

The results indicated that from 1980 to 1985, about one in six students attended schools that reported a serious problem with student alcohol use. In contrast, the proportion of students attending schools with a serious drug problem decreased from about one in four in 1980-81 to about one in seven in 1984-85. The most common explanation provided for a decreasing student alcohol or drug problem was changes in the school's discipline policy or increased enforcement of the existing policy. Few respondents attributed a reduction in student alcohol or drug problems to prevention or treatment programs. Limitations of the survey data are discussed as well as directions for future research.\r"

Econometric, exposure, experimental studies and advertising bans are examined. The evidence indicates that advertising bans do not reduce alcohol sales, total advertising expenditures have no reliable correlation with sales of alcoholic beverages, and that experimental studies typically show no effect of advertising on actual consumption. However, one set of studies does show that drinkers are exposed to more television alcohol advertisements, without making the causal connection clear. In general, the evidence indicates little impact of alcohol advertising on alcohol sales or drinking. However, some results are suggestive and there is a need for more sophisticated econometric, exposure and experimental studies that take into account a wider range of variables.\r"

The determinant recognized by HB4C5 MAb was well preserved in usual formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Experiments with four major histological types of the lung cancer showed that HB4C5 MAb reacted with adenocarcinoma (19/27), squamous cell carcinoma (2/15), and large cell carcinoma (4/6), but not with small cell carcinoma (0/7). The immunoreaction was seen in the cytoplasm. In addition, this MAb also reacted with some gastric and colon adenocarcinomas. Further study on normal lung and nonpulmonary tissues revealed that HB4C5 MAb bound only type II pneumocytes and proximal tubules of normal kidney.\r"

  ".W": "Contact between blood and artificial surfaces results in extensive quantitative and qualitative alterations in platelet function. We evaluated the efficacy of a brief infusion of iloprost (ZK36374), a stable analog of prostacyclin, in preventing these platelet changes during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Twelve nonsplenectomized male mongrel dogs (23 to 30 kg) were randomized to treatment (n = 6) and control (n = 6) groups. The treatment animals received an infusion of iloprost at a rate of 150 ng/kg/min with the infusion being terminated 30 minutes after the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, despite the fact that all animals were maintained on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 3 hours. In the control group, platelet counts dropped to 54% +/- 8.9% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) of initial levels at 30 minutes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and gradually rose to 87.2% +/- 6.7% at 3 hours. In contrast, the platelet counts of the iloprost-treated dogs remained stable throughout extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at 98.3% +/- 4.2% of initial counts. Platelet reactivity toward adenosine diphosphate revealed a significant and permanent loss of platelet function in the control group (37.0% +/- 2.1% inhibition). In contrast, the iloprost group demonstrated significant inhibition of platelet reactivity (79.2% +/- 8.3%) during the iloprost infusion but a return to normal function (4.2% +/- 6.7% inhibition) after cessation of drug infusion which persisted throughout extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plasma levels of the platelet-specific protein thrombospondin rose progressively from 918 +/- 89 ng/ml to 1465 +/- 239 ng/ml (delta 548 +/- 179 ng/ml) at 30 minutes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which indicates extensive release of platelet granule contents (p less than 0.05). In contrast, plasma thrombospondin levels in the iloprost group demonstrated no additional rise after cessation of the iloprost infusion. In conclusion, iloprost effectively preserves platelet number and function during extracorporeal circulation. The fact that its salutary effects outlast its presence in plasma suggests that prevention of initial platelet-synthetic surface interactions permits the appearance of reduced surface affinity for platelets and, thus, reduced synthetic surface thrombogenicity.\r"

  ".W": "No completely satisfactory experimental model exists to compare different techniques of preservation currently used in the distant procurement of a lung allograft. A canine model of left lung transplantation is described in which an inflatable cuff is placed around each pulmonary artery. Each cuff is connected to a subcutaneous reservoir, which allows alternate occlusion of either pulmonary artery. Functional assessment of lung function is made during ventilation of both lungs and after a 10-minute period of perfusion to the native lung alone and then to the transplanted lung alone. Systemic and pulmonary artery pressures are recorded continuously, and measurement of arterial blood gases and oxygen uptake are made immediately after the operation and again at 3 days. The animal is then put to death and the lungs are excised and weighed. Five dogs underwent transplantation of the donor lung immediately after excision (mean ischemic time = 55 +/- 7 minutes). Similar values for oxygen tension and oxygen uptake were obtained postoperatively for the right lung (oxygen tension = 420 mm Hg, oxygen uptake = 101 ml/min) and the left lung (oxygen tension = 368 mm Hg, oxygen uptake = 108 ml/min). However, carbon dioxide tension was elevated (right lung = 41 mm Hg, left lung = 52 mm Hg). Mean pulmonary artery pressure increased during allograft perfusion (right lung = 14 mm Hg, left lung = 24 mm Hg), although systemic blood pressure was unchanged. Similar results were observed at 3 days. The mean weight of the native lung was 101 +/- 2 gm and that of the transplanted lung, 128 +/- 6 gm. This model achieves consistent survival and allows serial observations of the functional adequacy of an allograft compared with a normal contralateral lung.\r"

We administered pergolide to patients with suboptimal control of Parkinson's disease who had a short-duration response to carbidopa-levodopa in a 6-month, double-blind study. Pergolide added to the carbidopa-levodopa regimen resulted in both subjective and objective improvement in comparison with placebo. In patients who tolerated pergolide, the median time spent in the \"off\" (parkinsonian) state was reduced from 5.0 to 2.2 hours daily (compared with a 0.3-hour reduction in the placebo group). These patients were able to decrease the median frequency of carbidopa-levodopa dosage from 7.5 to 5.0 doses daily (no change in the placebo group). Prolongation of the \"on\" response (optimal response to treatment) to single doses of drugs was corroborated by monitoring of the patients' Parkinson response cycle. The peak response was also improved in most patients. Of 25 patients randomized to the pergolide group, 7 were unable to tolerate this drug; confusion or hallucinations occurred in 4 of these patients, and chest pain, leukopenia, and nonspecific dizziness, respectively, developed in the other 3. All adverse events were reversible with reduction of the dose or discontinuation of the pergolide regimen. In conclusion, patients with Parkinson's disease who experience clinical fluctuations with carbidopa-levodopa may be helped by the addition of pergolide to the therapeutic regimen.\r"

We assessed the long-term outcome (2 1/2- to 3-year follow-up) in patients with Parkinson's disease who participated in our previous pergolide double-blind trial and were subsequently switched to open-label pergolide therapy. Of 41 evaluable patients who began pergolide therapy, 10 (24%) experienced sustained substantial benefit that persisted to the end of this investigation. A total of 23 patients (56%) remained on pergolide therapy and, as a group, had considerable improvement over baseline at 2 1/2 to 3 years on the basis of several measurements of efficacy. A tendency toward deterioration could be reversed in many patients by larger or more frequent doses of carbidopa-levodopa; nevertheless, all but four patients were still taking the same dose or less of carbidopa-levodopa at the end of this study as at the onset. Patients with the best initial response to pergolide seemed most likely to experience long-term benefit. Confusion and hallucinations were the side effects most likely to necessitate discontinuation of pergolide. Symptoms suggestive of dose-related angina pectoris occurred in four patients in the open-label phase and two patients in the earlier double-blind phase (13% of patients who started pergolide therapy); these symptoms were easily controlled by dose reduction or discontinuation of pergolide, without sequelae. Dose-related leukopenia developed in one patient.\r"

Measles developed in 2 of 119 children who received the EZ vaccine, in 1 before and in the other after 9 months of age. In the Schwarz group measles developed in 7 of 120 children--in 5 before and in 2 after 9 months of age. Serological responses measured at 5 months after vaccination and at 18 months of age were satisfactory in both groups although in the Schwarz group levels were on average 2-fold higher than in the EZ group. The frequencies of fever, cough, vomiting, and diarrhoea were no higher in the EZ vaccinees in the 3 weeks following vaccination than in age-matched non-immunised controls. Long-term morbidity as assessed by clinic attendances and weight at 18 months of age was much the same in the two groups. The EZ measles vaccine is thus safe and clinically and serologically effective when used in a high dose to immunise young Gambian infants.\r"

Because in diabetes the majority of T cells activated in vivo express CD4 and the islet beta cells selectively express the HLA class II antigens needed for recognition by CD4-positive T cells, the possibility that selective damage to islet beta cells may be caused by CD4-positive cytotoxic cells was investigated. Activated T cells were cloned from a newly diagnosed diabetic patient, and many CD4 cytotoxic clones were detected. The clone with the highest cytolytic capacity lysed HLA class II compatible islet cells which had been induced by interferon gamma and tumour necrosis factor to express class II antigens. The specificity of the lysis was demonstrated by use of histoincompatible islets, other histocompatible target cells, and blocking by anti-class-II monoclonal antibodies. The results show that a CD4-positive T cell clone can lyse HLA class II matched islet cells; this process may be important in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.\r"

At necropsy, bilateral renal dysplasia was found in 23 and pulmonary hypoplasia in 13; 16 had structural or chromosomal anomalies, less than half of which were detected by prenatal ultrasound. In the survivors, 8 had posterior urethral valves, 1 had oligohydramnios, and 2 had associated anomalies. Obstructive uropathy is often associated with other anomalies which may escape prenatal ultrasound detection, and studies to determine the efficacy of intrauterine decompression techniques must allow for this observation.\r"

It is often taught that the increment in the anion gap will exactly match the fall in serum bicarbonate during a simple metabolic acidosis of the high anion gap type; if the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate level are not equivalent, a second acid-base disorder should be suspected. The assumptions upon which this formulation is based are largely unsubstantiated. This review critically examines these assumptions and their clinical implications. Discrepancies between the increment in the anion gap and the reduction in serum bicarbonate must be interpreted cautiously.\r"

A series of measurements was made evaluating the relationship of the innominate artery to the tracheostomy tube and to laryngotracheal structures. In every dissection, some part of the tracheostomy tube cuff or tip was found to be adjacent to the innominate artery. We conclude that, contrary to general belief, placement of the tracheotomy incision at the second and third tracheal rings will not in and of itself protect the innominate artery from rupture.\r"

  ".W": "Four new technologies have transformed the treatment of urinary calculi: electrohydraulic lithotripsy, ultrasonic lithotripsy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, and laser lithotripsy. Initial attempts to ablate urinary calculi by continuous wave CO2, ruby, and Nd-YAG lasers failed because of excess thermal injury and inability to pass the laser energy via a flexible fiber. Basic laboratory studies then demonstrated that short pulsed laser energy absorbed by the calculus resulted in fragmentation. The parameters that produced optimal urinary calculus fragmentation were found using the flashlamp pumped tunable dye laser, with the following parameters: wavelength: 504 nm; pulse duration: 1 microsec; fiber: 250 micro silica-coated quartz; repetition: 5-20 Hz. Use of pulsed dye laser caused no tissue damage. The mechanism of fragmentation is light absorption, plasma development, and repetitive acoustic shock wave action with resultant fragmentation. The techniques for application of laser to calculi have been successful, and new, miniature instruments have been developed. Laser lithotripsy is a successful method for fragmenting ureteral calculi. The small caliber of the laser fiber makes this method useful for treating calculi in narrow, tortuous ureters; impacted calculi; distal calculi in ureters that cannot be dilated, via the percutaneous route for stones in calyces or impacted in the upper ureter. Investigations are continuing to optimize fragmentation of harder calculi and to use laser fragmentation within the kidney. Laser lithotripsy may also be used to fragment biliary calculi.\r"

  ".W": "A comparison is made of laser anastomoses of the murine vas deferens at different energies with the neodymium (Nd):YAG laser at 1.06 micron and 1.318 micron and with the CO2 laser. A total of 28 welds were performed with a free-hand technique employing a 600-micron silicon fiber with the Nd:YAG and a hand piece with a 500-micron spot size for the CO2. After 6 weeks, all animals were sacrificed and the vasa evaluated for patency. Fifteen out of 28 controls repaired with microsurgical techniques were found to be patent; 4/10 vasa were patent with use of the Nd:YAG at 1.318 micron at laser energies of 300 mW and 500 mW. At 1.06 micron, only 1/4 anastomoses was patent at a power setting of 1 W. None of the anastomoses performed with the CO2 laser was patent. Histologic study revealed intense fibrosis in all the lasered vasa, with sperm granuloma formation associated with most anastomoses. Although this is a preliminary study, it appears that the Nd:YAG laser at 1.318 micron and a power setting of 300-500 mW provides patency rates superior to the Nd:YAG at 1.06 micron and to the CO2 lasers and is equivalent to standard micro-surgical techniques in the murine vas deferens.\r"

  ".U": "89013821\r", 
  ".W": "One of the most fundamental beliefs in exercise physiology is that performance during maximum exercise of short duration is limited by the inability of the heart and lungs to provide oxygen at a rate sufficiently fast to fuel energy production by the active muscle mass. This belief originates from work undertaken in the 1920's by Hill and Lupton. A result is that most, if not all, of the studies explaining the effects of exercise training or detraining or other interventions on human physiology explain these changes in terms either of central adaptations increasing oxygen delivery to muscle or of peripheral adaptations that modify the rates of oxygen or fuel utilization by the active muscles. Yet a critical review of Hill and Lupton's results shows that they inferred but certainly did not prove that oxygen limitation develops during maximal exercise. Furthermore, more modern studies suggest that, if such an oxygen limitation does indeed occur during maximal exercise, it develops in about 50% of test subjects. Thus, an alternative mechanism may need to be evoked to explain exhaustion during maximal exercise in a rather large group of subjects. This review proposes that the factors limiting maximal exercise performance might be better explained in terms of a failure of muscle contractility (\"muscle power\"), which may be independent of tissue oxygen deficiency. The implications for exercise testing and the prediction of athletic performance are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Myofiber injury-repair was studied in rat soleus muscles to elucidate the role of infiltrating cells in the injury-repair process. Muscle injury was induced by forced muscle lengthening with the contralateral muscle serving as a control. The muscles were removed for histologic, histochemical and immunohistochemical procedures at varying periods (12-120 h) post-injury. All injured muscles were severely damaged with many cells present in the interstitial spaces between myofibers. Normal appearing myofibers demonstrated elevated lysosomal proteolytic activity, but no evidence of increased activity, indicative of phagocytic cells, was found in or between damaged myofibers. The esterase stain for macrophages and immunohistochemical techniques for mast cells also provided no support for either cell type predominating in the damaged area, although mast cell degranulation could be observed in the pericapillary regions. In contrast, the use of a specific antisera for a multicatalytic protease uniquely defined most of these cells as myogenic in origin. They appeared to be most numerous between the torn ends of a myofiber. Surprisingly, the remainder of the cells appeared to be of lymphoid origin.\r"

  ".W": "After forced muscle lengthening of rat soleus muscle, alterations in muscle connective tissues were monitored by fluorescent immunohistochemical methods. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the polysaccharide attachment region of proteoglycans were used to observe changes in localization of 4-sulfated, 6-sulfated, or unsulfated chondroitin sulfate disaccharide units covalently bound to the proteoglycan protein core after injury. Additionally, fluorescein-labeled concanavalin A lectin and polyclonal antiserum to heparan sulfate proteoglycan were also localized in muscle sections during the regenerative process over 5 days after injury. Although proteoglycan localization was absent at or near the site of myofiber damage after injury, some distinct basal lamina remained as a matrix for regenerating myofibers. By the fifth day post-injury, the localization of these matrix components had returned to that seen in uninjured soleus muscles. The physiological significance of these extracellular matrix changes appeared to center on the repair of the torn myofiber and indicate an interdependence between myofibers and the extracellular matrix in this type of regeneration.\r"

Interference pattern methods-turns analysis, spectral analysis-are efficient, but the results usually cannot be directly related to the physiological properties of the motor units. Integration analysis does not currently have a major role in diagnostic electromyography. Traditional measurement of single motor unit action potentials during weak contraction can be facilitated and made more objective with computer assistance, but only the lowest-threshold motor units in the muscle are amenable to study. A new class of methodologies under development permit the decomposition of interference patterns into their constituent motor unit action potentials for measurement of configurational and behavioral properties. Patient data from these various methods can be statistically compared with normative data bases available on-line in computerized electromyographs. Both quantitative and quantitative electromyography have applications in the neuromuscular electrodiagnostic examination.\r"

The drug had no significant effect on the progression of the disease. The trial had statistical power comparable to previous larger-scale multicenter trials. This reflected the low variability in the patients in relation to the magnitude of the overall deterioration. Measurements of muscle force (myometry and MRC score) had much greater statistical power than measurements of function (motor ability score and walking times) as analyzed by our methods. These observations have important implications for the design of future trials.\r"

Jerk-locked averaging and evoked potential studies are useful for further investigating the pathophysiology of myoclonus and can be performed by using the same recording electrodes as those used for the polygraph. Jerk-locked evoked potentials and double-stimulation evoked potentials can be employed only for further investigating how cerebral cortex is involved in the generation of certain myoclonia. All these techniques can be used in proper combinations depending on the clinical features of the myoclonus in question, the purpose of the study, and the facilities available in each laboratory. These techniques also will be useful for following the clinical course during the treatment with antimyoclonus agents.\r"

  ".W": "Hypoglycemia may develop in patients with severe untreated malaria and can complicate the course of treatment with parenteral quinine as a result of quinine-induced hyperinsulinemia. Intravenous quinine is used increasingly as the therapy of choice in patients with severe malaria, most of whom are children. To assess the importance of both pretreatment and quinine-related hypoglycemia in children in an area in which the disease is endemic, we prospectively studied 95 Malawian children with falciparum malaria and altered consciousness who were treated with intravenous quinine. Nineteen patients had hypoglycemia before treatment. Seven (37 percent) died, and five of the survivors (26 percent) had neurologic sequelae. The corresponding values for patients who were initially normoglycemic were 4 percent and 4 percent, respectively (P less than 0.0001). Hypoglycemia was associated with low plasma insulin concentrations and with elevated plasma concentrations of lactate, alanine, and 5'-nucleotidase--a finding that suggests that impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis but not hyperinsulinemia contributes to the pathogenesis of pretreatment hypoglycemia. All patients were given quinine dihydrochloride in a 5 percent dextrose infusion, and those with hypoglycemia received 50 percent dextrose. Hypoglycemia recurred in seven of the patients with pretreatment hypoglycemia, but these episodes were also not associated with hyperinsulinemia. Of the 76 children who were initially normoglycemic, none became hypoglycemic during the course of treatment with intravenous quinine. We conclude that hypoglycemia is a frequent complication of falciparum malaria in children and that it reflects severe disease and is associated with a poor prognosis. We did not find it to be a complication of quinine treatment.\r"

In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, the planned 10-day treatment was unsuccessful in 15 percent of the vancomycin, ticarcillin, and amikacin group (n = 53), as compared with 38 percent of the group receiving ticarcillin-clavulanate and amikacin (n = 48) (P = 0.010). Of 10 episodes of breakthrough bacteremia, 9 (1 fatal) occurred in patients treated with ticarcillin-clavulanate and amikacin (P = 0.006). Each of the 10 microbial isolates was a gram-positive bacterium with similar susceptibilities to vancomycin and ticarcillin-clavulanate in vitro. Both regimens were well tolerated. None of the patients had detectable renal dysfunction, but those receiving vancomycin, ticarcillin, and amikacin were more likely to have twofold increases in serum hepatic-enzyme activity. Rashes consistent with the \"red-man\" syndrome occurred in three patients upon the infusion of vancomycin and in three others who received a placebo. We conclude that the combination of vancomycin, ticarcillin, and amikacin is more effective than ticarcillin-clavulanate and amikacin as empirical antibiotic therapy in clinical settings in which gram-positive bacteremias are a serious problem.\r"

The patients entered the study as soon as possible after hospital admission (at a mean [+/- SD] of 7.9 +/- 8.0 hours after the last episode of pain), and the study was ended after 6 +/- 3 days, when definitive therapy had been selected. Major end points--refractory angina, myocardial infarction, and death--occurred in 23, 12, and 1.7 percent of the 118 patients receiving placebo, respectively. Heparin was associated with a decrease in the occurrence of refractory angina (P = 0.002). The incidence of myocardial infarction was significantly reduced in the groups receiving aspirin (3 percent; P = 0.01), heparin (0.8 percent; P less than 0.001), and aspirin plus heparin (1.6 percent, P = 0.003), and no deaths occurred in these groups. There were too few deaths overall to permit evaluation of the effect of treatment on this end point. The combination of aspirin and heparin had no greater protective effect than heparin alone but was associated with slightly more serious bleeding (3.3 vs. 1.7 percent). We conclude that in the acute phase of unstable angina, either aspirin or heparin treatment is associated with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction, and there is a trend favoring heparin over aspirin. Heparin treatment is also associated with a reduced incidence of refractory angina.\r"

In the only state discussed, in which the kidney is diseased and not merely responding to extrarenal reflexes--i.e., nephrotic syndrome--intrarenal mechanisms may predominate and lead to expansion of the arterial vascular tree and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (i.e., hypervolemic nephrotic syndrome). Otherwise, when kidneys are healthy, either a fall in cardiac output or peripheral arterial vasodilatation may diminish arterial vascular filling and thereby initiate a series of hemodynamic and hormonal events that result in renal sodium and water retention (Fig. 7). Finally, the approach presented in this article should be considered to be a vantage point from which to evaluate states of sodium and water retention, but not to be an exclusive position.\r"

To explore the feasibility of this strategy, we vaccinated 40 pregnant women at a mean gestation of 31 weeks with a single 50-microgram dose of the Type III capsular polysaccharide of group B streptococcus. The only adverse effect detected was a mild local reaction in nine women (22 percent). Of the 35 women with low or unprotective antibody levels before immunization (less than 2 micrograms per milliliter), 20 (57 percent) responded to the vaccine. The geometric mean antibody level rose from 1.3 to 7.1 micrograms per milliliter four weeks after vaccination (P less than 0.02), and these levels persisted at delivery and three months post partum. Sixty-two percent of the vaccine-induced immunoglobulin in the mothers was IgG, which readily crosses the placenta. Infant antibody levels in cord serum correlated directly with maternal antibody levels at delivery (r = 0.913, P less than 0.001). Of the 25 infants born to women who responded to the vaccine, 80 percent continued to have protective levels of antibody at one month of age and 64 percent had protective levels at three months. Serum samples from infants with greater than or equal to 2 micrograms of antibody to Type III group B streptococcus per milliliter uniformly promoted efficient opsonization, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing in vitro of Type III strains. This effect could be mediated exclusively by the alternative complement pathway. Although this vaccine with an overall response rate of 63 percent is not optimally immunogenic, we conclude that maternal immunization is feasible and can provide passive immunity against systemic infection with Type III group B streptococcus in the majority of newborns. Larger trials with better vaccines will be required to evaluate the safety and clinical effectiveness of this strategy.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin resistance occurs in a variety of conditions, including diabetes, obesity and essential hypertension, but its underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, it is insulin-resistance in skeletal muscle, the chief site of insulin-mediated glucose disposal in humans, that predominantly accounts for the low rates of glucose clearance from the blood, and hence for impaired glucose tolerance. Human type 2 diabetes is characterized by a decrease in non-oxidative glucose storage (muscle glycogen synthesis), and by the deposition of amyloid in the islets of Langerhans. Amylin is a 37-amino-acid peptide which is a major component of islet amyloid and has structural similarity to human calcitonin gene-related peptide-2 (CGRP-2; ref. 8). CGRP is a neuropeptide which may be involved in motor activity in skeletal muscle. We now report that human pancreatic amylin and rat CGRP-1 are potent inhibitors of both basal and insulin-stimulated rates of glycogen synthesis in stripped rat soleus muscle in vitro. These results may provide a basis for a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms that cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.\r"

Upon switching four patients from beef/pork insulin to human insulin, we found that elevated baseline antibody levels in three women decreased, in two to undetectable levels at term. The fourth patient had undetectable antibody levels at baseline and borderline levels at term. Only one of their four newborns had antibodies. Upon initiation of insulin treatment in another five diabetics without detectable antibodies at baseline, only two developed antibodies, and only one of their newborns developed antibodies. Two other patients, initially not on insulin, had baseline elevations of antibody that decreased with administration of human insulin; both of their newborns had antibodies. Overt diabetes evolved subsequently in both mothers after pregnancy. We conclude the following: 1) Upon transfer from beef/pork insulin to human insulin, mothers and their newborns show a decrease in insulin antibodies; 2) new patients initiated on insulin develop low levels of antibodies, if any, and their newborns also have low levels of antibodies if any; and 3) the decreased or absent immunogenicity of human insulin supports its use in pregnant diabetics.\r"

Five of these nine had serologic evidence of previous exposure and immunity; all five had uneventful pregnancies. Three of the four women who exhibited serologic evidence of recent exposure to the parvovirus had hydropic fetuses who died, one of whom was anencephalic. Histologic and DNA hybridization studies suggest parvovirus infection as a cause for nonimmune hydrops and fetal death. A review of the literature suggests that of 37 women who were exposed and infected by human B19 parvovirus during pregnancy, 14 (38%) had adverse outcomes, including spontaneous abortions, intrauterine fetal death, and congenital anomalies. Women at high risk for exposure (school teachers) should have screening for immunoglobulin G parvovirus-specific antibodies; if these are absent, they should avoid close contact with schoolchildren. Pregnant women with evidence of recent infection should have a level II ultrasound. Because no vaccine is currently available, routine screening cannot be recommended.\r"

In comparison with culture, the two direct fluorescent antibody tests showed sensitivities of 37.5 and 56.5% and specificities of 97.0 and 99.4% when read by experienced microbiology technologists recently trained in chlamydia direct fluorescent antibody interpretation and blinded to culture results. Overall sensitivities of 69.6 and 78.3% for the direct fluorescent antibody tests were obtained by an expert interpreter during discrepancy analysis. When only direct fluorescent antibody test specimens from the first swab after endocervical cleansing were considered, recently trained interpreters obtained sensitivities of 53.8 and 69.2%, and both direct fluorescent antibody tests were 100% sensitive for the expert interpreter. These data emphasize the critical importance of observer expertise and swab order to the accuracy of chlamydia direct fluorescent antibody tests. Previous studies of these tests are examined to determine how these factors and others may have influenced the outcome.\r"

For 65%, these symptoms persist for at least 1 year, and for 20%, the hot flushes are present for more than 5 years. Estrogen replacement therapy is the treatment of choice for the management of vasomotor symptoms, with or without additional behavior symptoms, and should be considered safe for most postmenopausal women.

The hysteroscope as we know it today is similar to the early cystoscope described and presented in 1877 by Nitze. The instruments and technique of endoscopy underwent advances by people such as Heineberg (1914), Rubin (1925), Mickulicz-Radecki (1927), and Norment (1949). Vulmiere applied cold light fiberoptics, and Marleschki (1965) introduced the early form of the contact hysteroscope. Edstrom and Fernstrom introduced the use of a solution of a high-molecular-weight dextran from beet sugar as a distending medium, and Hamou (1980) designed a 4-mm microcolpohysteroscope for histologic diagnosis in the reproductive tract.\r"

  ".U": "89015581\r", 
  ".W": "In less than two decades, hysteroscopy has evolved into a practical technique for the evaluation of the uterine cavity, with well-established indications such as evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding and abnormal hysterograms as well as the treatment of intrauterine adhesions or the septate uterus, the removal of misplaced or embedded intrauterine devices, and the removal of submucous leiomyomas. As the use of hysteroscopy increases and more practitioners utilize it, new instrumentation and techniques are beginning to evolve, simplifying and facilitating not only a diagnostic examination, but also the more difficult and complex surgical interventions. Flexible endoscopes are being tested for possible use in the uterine cavity, and operative hysteroscopes with practical inflow and outflow accessory channels have been introduced. The accessory operative instrumentation has also been expanded and refined, and portable units for office examinations have been developed. The trend in the development of instrumentation is toward simplicity, effectiveness, and refinement in lenses with wider fields of view and accessory channels without compromising the total outer diameter of the endoscopes. As clinical applications expand as a result of increased use and proficiency in hysteroscopy, new applications undoubtedly will follow, such as closer study of the endometrium with and without additional magnification. This latter may permit a better understanding of the receptivity of the endometrium to the embryo, which may help in predicting successful nidations. Portable laser units with the capability to use the CO2 fiber undoubtedly will increase laser use through hysteroscopy, and in the near future, photodynamic therapy may become the best approach to the selective treatment of intrauterine lesions. The uterotubal junction will remain an attractive area for endoscopists to approach the fallopian tubes transcervically and eventually to accomplish tubal closure safely and effectively with the possibility of future reversibility. The hysteroscope will play an important role in new reproductive technologies, particularly those related to the gamete intrafallopian transfer via the uterine side and perhaps also for direct embryo transfers under visual control. The future of hysteroscopy thus is promising. The present diagnostic and therapeutic applications will not only become a standard of treatment but will expand as gynecologists will gain proficiency and confidence in this endoscopic method.\r"

  ".W": "Six epikeratoplasty (EKP) specimens were obtained 1 to 10 months after refractive keratoplasty for aphakia (2 cases), keratoconus (1 case), and myopia (3 cases). The EKP grafts were removed because of postoperative complications such as delayed reepithelialization, lenticule edema, stromal ulceration, graft opacification, and inability to improve vision in a clear graft. The extent of epithelial abnormalities was associated directly with the severity of structural changes in the underlying basal lamina, Bowman's layer, and stroma as evidenced by electron microscopic examination. Epithelial defects were associated with varying degrees of sterile stromal ulceration of the underlying lenticule. In one case, an extensive full-thickness ulceration of the EKP button occurred in the area of persistent epithelial defects and was associated with a major ulceration of the underlying recipient's corneal stroma. Removing the failing button halted the ulcerative process with prompt reepithelialization. In the absence of inflammation and infection, the persistent epithelial abnormalities and defects leading to proteolytic degradation of the EKP buttons constitute an important mechanism of graft failure with major visual consequences and possibly irreversible ocular damage.\r"

  ".W": "Nineteen patients with keratoconus underwent epikeratophakia by one of the authors (DSD) and were followed from 3 to 29 months. Patient selection criteria included contact lens failure, and minimal or no central corneal scarring. Uncorrected visual acuity improved by three or more Snellen lines in 13 of 19 patients (68%). Postoperatively, after more than 6 months follow-up, 81% of the patients had best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better. A mean flattening of 4.73 diopters (D) occurred on keratometry readings. There was a mean decrease in refractive cylinder of 2.84 D. Spherical equivalent refraction showed a mean decrease in myopia of 4.64 D. Five patients had postoperative refractive cylinder greater than 4 D requiring relaxing incision(s). With some patients having been followed for more than 2 years, no recurrences of keratoconus have been noted. In properly selected patients, epikeratophakia can effectively be used to treat keratoconus and thus avoid potential intraocular surgical complications and immunogenic phenomena.\r"

Patients were followed for an average of 33 months. There were 20 failures, 18 of which were because of inadequate intraocular pressure (IOP) control (required 20% reduction in outflow pressure). Twelve failures were in the epinephrine group and eight were in the timolol group. During the first year of therapy, 35% compared with 0% of patients failed in the epinephrine and timolol groups, respectively (P less than 0.01). During the later years of the study, the failure rates in the two groups were similar. The results suggest that timolol is superior to epinephrine during the first year of therapy, and likely as effective as epinephrine in the long-term treatment of glaucoma.\r"

During phase II, in six patients whose IOP was reduced inadequately with 0.25% levobunolol, one had a significant reduction in IOP with 0.5% levobunolol.

  ".W": "Automated perimetry is used to monitor changes associated with many ocular conditions such as glaucoma, neuro-ophthalmologic disorders, and retinal diseases. Comparisons among sequential visual fields are crucial to the determination of progression or regression of ocular anomalies, and to evaluate the efficacy of various therapeutic regimens. The Delta program for the Octopus perimeter uses a t test to provide an objective comparison of visual fields. To evaluate the utility of the t test for detecting visual field changes, the authors used computer simulation to generate pairs of visual fields with known alterations, and made comparisons with the t test procedure used by the Delta program. An initial visual field based on normal data was produced and stored. A second visual field, based on the same normal data but with a scotoma of known size and depth, was also produced and stored. A t test (as used by the Delta program) was then used to compare the two visual fields for statistically significant differences. Our results indicate that the t test was very sensitive to small changes of the entire visual field, such as those produced by both pathologic and nonpathologic (day-to-day sensitivity variations, changes in pupil size, etc.) factors. However, the t test was unable to reliably detect small to moderate scotomata (less than or equal to 18 degrees in diameter), even when the sensitivity loss was greater than 35 dB. These findings suggest that the t test has limited clinical utility for objective detection of pathologic visual field loss, and that additional procedures may be necessary to provide reliable detection of visual field changes.\r"

Most of the eyes had extensive peripheral anterior synechiae, and 16 of 17 (94%) were pseudophakic or aphakic following keratoplasty. Other glaucoma procedures had been performed previously on 13 eyes: argon laser trabeculoplasty (one eye), trabeculectomy (seven eyes), transpupillary argon laser cyclophotocoagulation (three eyes), and cyclocryotherapy (three eyes). Follow-up ranged from 5 to 28 months (mean, 13 months). Three eyes underwent repeat Molteno implantation when intraocular pressure (IOP) was not satisfactorily reduced after the first procedure. Considering one eye with chronic hypotony as a failure, 12 of 17 eyes (71%) had IOPs of less than 21 mmHg at the time of the three most recent postoperative examinations after a single Molteno implant. Repeat implants in three eyes increased the number of eyes with IOPs of less than 21 mmHg to 14 (82%). Corneal allograft rejection after Molteno implantation occurred in seven eyes; two of these were successfully reversed with corticosteroid therapy. Three of the five eyes with irreversible graft rejection were regrafted, and two of these grafts have remained clear. Including the regrafted eyes, 13 eyes had clear grafts and controlled IOPs at the most recent postoperative examination. The Molteno implant may prove useful in the management of medically uncontrollable glaucoma following penetrating keratoplasty; however, there appears to be a substantial risk of postoperative graft rejection.\r"

One drop of 1.0% ALO 2145 or vehicle was instilled 1 hour before and immediately after laser surgery. The mean IOP increase in the ALO 2145-treated group was lower (P less than 0.05) than in the placebo group at each of the first three postoperative hours. Overall, 18% of placebo-treated eyes experienced IOP increases greater than or equal to 10 mmHg as compared with 4% of ALO 2145-treated eyes (P less than 0.003).

The ultrastructural and immunopathologic characteristics of the conjunctiva from these patients were distinctly different from those of the conjunctiva from SJS patients without recurrent conjunctivitis, and suggested an active, immunologically mediated inflammation. Vasculitis or perivasculitis, immunoreactant deposition in vessel walls, vascular basement membrane disruption, thickening, and reduplication, and a preponderance of helper T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans' cells were the notable distinguishing features in those patients with recurrent conjunctival inflammation.

  ".W": "Immunologic differences exist between the peripheral and central cornea. The peripheral cornea is closer to the conjunctiva, which has all of the immunologic machinery necessary to generate an immune response. The peripheral cornea has more Langerhans' cells and IgM than the central cornea. The peripheral cornea also has more C1, the recognition unit of the classic pathway of complement, than the central cornea so that antigen-antibody complexes, whether formed in the cornea itself or whether derived from the tears, aqueous humor, or limbal vessels, may activate complement more effectively in the peripheral than central cornea. Autoimmune diseases that involve the peripheral cornea include Mooren's ulcer and collagen vascular diseases. The humoral- and cell-mediated autoimmune phenomena that are associated with Mooren's ulcer and its response to immunosuppressive therapy suggest that it is an autoimmune disease directed against the cornea itself. Collagen vascular diseases may be associated with peripheral corneal ulcers with or without scleritis. In these diseases, circulating immune complexes may lodge in the limbal vasculature causing an immune vasculitis or deposit in the peripheral cornea setting off the complement cascade. Peripheral corneal diseases that probably represent a hypersensitivity reaction to exogenous antigens include catarrhal infiltrates and ulcers and phlyctenules. In the United States today, these corneal lesions are generally associated with staphylococcal blepharitis. Experimental models suggest that hypersensitivity to Staphylococcus aureus cell wall antigens may be important to their immunopathogenesis.\r"

Patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively for conjunctival inflammation, conjunctival cicatrization, degree of keratopathy, and disease stage. No patient progressed in disease stage. Vision improved an average of 3.5 Snellen lines (-3 to +8). Worse outcome was associated with chemotherapy intolerance or the presence of any preoperative conjunctival inflammation. Thirteen patients remained on immunosuppressives for the entire study. Corneal ulcers developed postoperatively in three patients in whom continued immunosuppression was not tolerated.

  ".W": "The imprecision of trephination of donor and recipient corneas is a major factor in post-keratoplasty astigmatism. In order to improve the quality of trephination, the authors developed a rotating slit delivery system for noncontact penetrating keratoplasty trephination using the excimer laser at 193 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and light microscopy (LM) demonstrated the superior quality of excimer-cut buttons and recipient beds as compared with those obtained by free hand and suction trephines in human cadaver and rabbit eyes. The laser trephined more regularly and precisely without distortion of corneal topography and with less damage to adjacent corneal tissue. The authors morphologically examined wound healing at 6 hours, 12 hours, 3 days, 5 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, and 3 months after penetrating keratoplasty with laser and mechanical trephination in an animal autograft model. The laser did not cause any adverse alteration of wound healing processes including cellular migration, proliferation, and production of new tissue.\r"

Sixty-three patients, 8 to 18 years of age, underwent this procedure in 65 eyes. Twenty-eight patients had congenital cataracts and 35 had traumatic cataracts. Fifty-one of the 65 eyes were aphakic at the time of surgery (secondary procedures). All surgeries were successful; no tissue lenses were lost or removed. Postoperatively, 73% of the patients were within 3 diopters (D) of emmetropia. The patients with congenital cataracts gained an average of one Snellen line of best-corrected visual acuity; patients with traumatic cataracts lost an average of one Snellen line of best-corrected visual acuity. In older pediatric patients, epikeratophakia appears to be a safe and effective procedure for the correction of aphakia.\r"

He established the first graduate course for ophthalmologists, suggested the formation of the instruction courses of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and was the principal founder of the American Board of Ophthalmology. He founded and edited the Yearbook of Ophthalmology and Ophthalmic Literature. In 1918, he became editor of the third series of the American Journal of Ophthalmology, which consolidated five ophthalmic periodicals. In 1885, he popularized retinoscopy in the United States and was mainly responsible for making it a practical refraction tool. Two years later, he described the cross cylinder to determine the presence or absence of astigmatism. In 1907, he described the use of the cross cylinder to refine the axis of a correcting cylinder in astigmatism. He lectured and wrote widely and published over 700 scientific articles, book chapters, and books.\r"

The etiology and pathogenesis of these three diseases are still not fully understood. Identifying and distinctive characteristics among them include the history of ocular trauma in sympathetic ophthalmia, rupture of the lens capsule in phacoanaphylatic endophthalmitis, and involvement of the skin, ear, and central nervous system in VKH disease. A T-cell-mediated immune reaction to ocular antigens seems to play a major role in sympathetic ophthalmia and VKH disease. A B-cell-related Arthus reaction to lens antigen seems to be the principle mechanism of PE. Thus, these three diseases may represent a spectrum of uveitis. At one end is the delayed-type hypersensitivity disease of sympathetic ophthalmia, whereas at the opposite end is the immune complex disease of PE, with VKH disease in the middle of this uveitic spectrum.\r"

Results of cytologic examination appeared to be more accurate than those of conventional lymphocyte surface marker studies in the diagnosis of an intraocular lymphoma. Long-term survival occurred in some patients treated with a combination of intrathecal chemotherapy and ocular/CNS irradiation.\r"

In 1981, the choroidal osteoma began to thin and decalcify. Subretinal neovascularization developed in 1982 and was treated with argon laser photocoagulation. In 1983, the tumor was thinner and less calcified. During the next 18 months, it became completely decalcified and essentially disappeared leaving only a bed of pigment epithelial and choriocapillaris atrophy. This was confirmed with fluorescein angiography and ultrasonography.\r"

All 11 patients either demonstrated serious myelosuppression which precluded the continuation of intravenous ganciclovir therapy (5 patients) or were experiencing progressive CMV retinitis despite therapy with maximum-tolerable dosages of intravenous ganciclovir (6 patients). Suppression of the retinitis was observed in 11 (78%) of the 14 treated eyes. Three eyes (22%) showed no improvement after the initial intravitreal injection. One rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) occurred during an injection. There were no other complications, and no intraocular drug toxicity was observed. Reactivation of CMV retinitis necessitated repeated injections in 9 (64%) of the 14 eyes. The authors' experience with these 30 intravitreal injections indicates that the procedure is safe and effective both as an alternative to intravenous ganciclovir therapy in myelosuppressed patients and as a supplement to intravenous therapy in uncontrolled CMV retinitis.\r"

Tumors were treated in two regimens: 30 minutes at 43 degrees to 45 degrees C and 5 minutes at greater than 50 degrees C. Temperatures were estimated from applied power levels, based on empirical data and mathematical models. Histopathologic changes observed in human tumors were compared with changes seen in malignant melanoma xenografts in athymic nude mice which were treated with ultrasonically induced hyperthermia for 30 minutes at 42 degrees to 46 degrees C. The effects of treatment were similar to changes seen in the animal model treated under analogous conditions: increased intercellular spacing, cytoplasmic vacuole formation, clumping of chromatin, breaks in cell membranes, and swelling and collapse of cells. Perivascular and peripheral zones sometimes showed decreased damage levels. The high temperature (greater than 50 degrees C) technique is presently being used as a means of \"sterilizing\" tumors before planned enucleation. The moderate temperature (43 degrees-45 degrees C) technique has been used in combination with radiotherapy to treat tumors when vision can be salvaged.\r"

The tumors in the radiation treatment field showed continued postirradiation growth clinically in four of the five eyes, and mitotic activity histologically in all five cases. Two and one half years after irradiation, and nearly 2 years after subsequent enucleation, one of those two patients had biopsy-proven liver metastases, and later died.

On the basis of the review of our cases of OHL and our review of the literature, we conclude that a definitive diagnosis of OHL requires either the biochemical evidence of Epstein-Barr virus or the ultrastructural demonstration of herpesviruses in suspected lesions.\r"

Since a great majority of patients can be successfully treated with nonoperative methods, office management of these patients is a very important issue for all clinicians. Patients with low back pain can be divided into three major groups: 1) the first group with acute (initial onset or very occasional recurrent) symptoms, 2) the second group with chronic (frequent intermittent recurrent or persistent) symptoms and 3) the third group with resistant symptoms. For the first group with acute symptoms, establishment of a specific diagnosis is rarely necessary. An active nonoperative treatment program (brief rest, protection, physical therapy modalities, medication, exercises, and reconditioning) provides a high rate (nearly 90 to 95 per cent) of success (return to normal activities and work) within 8 to 12 weeks. For the second group, with chronic symptoms, establishment of a specific diagnosis and a comprehensive and specific history are essential. Diagnostic procedures for specific pathologic conditions are outlined. A clear and specific treatment goal should be established and communicated to all the parties involved. Nonoperative treatment for this group includes back school, postural exercises, bracing, exercises for strength and endurance, work-site modification, vocational counseling, and pain management. For the third group with resistant symptoms, the role of the orthopedic or neurosurgeon is as a consultant to a pain management team for evaluation and treatment of missed diagnosis or complications of previous treatments.\r"

As the population in the United States becomes more aged, the magnitude of this problem will certainly become greater. Significant progress has been made in recent years with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporotic bone disease. Future treatment possibilities being investigated include cyclical coherence programs and cyclical parathyroid hormone administration. While showing some initial promise, these new modalities have been used only in a limited number of patients and must be considered highly experimental. Despite the progress being made in the treatment of osteoporosis, hope for the future clearly rests with prevention. Arresting bone loss has proven to be much more effective than rebuilding a depleted skeleton. Advances must be made in determining the pathogenesis of osteoporosis with the goal of identifying those individuals at highest risk at a young age, when skeletal mass is still increasing. Intervention could then be aimed at maximizing the peak bone density through a combination of proper nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes. Clearly, there is much more to learn about this very common and debilitating disease.\r"

The clinician can more effectively grade and follow the clinical course of nerve injuries, evaluate anomalies of innervation, and graphically confirm the results of nerve repairs and nerve grafts. The digital electroneurometer provides a simple, painless, and inexpensive means for determination of distal motor latency in peripheral nerves. Its advantages relate to its small size, accessibility, and simplicity of operation. The digital electroneurometer does not replace standard testing procedures. The muscle action potential is not visualized; amplitude and duration cannot be measured. Sensory latency determinations cannot be performed. Though its limitations are clear, the digital electroneurometer can provide valuable information to the orthopedic surgeon in his office. Further clinical trials are necessary to confirm the material in this limited study and to investigate its application to a broader range of clinical problems.\r"

Although therapies like those used to treat asthma are employed in the treatment of virus-induced wheezing in infancy, their efficacy remains controversial in bronchiolitis. Recently developed agents with antiviral properties are promising and the choice of any of these agents in a therapeutic regimen should be individualized. Antiviral agents during acute infections may modify the long-term sequelae.

The diagnosis is documented by performance of an exercise challenge test such as a treadmill or cycloergometer to verify bronchospasm induced by exercise. The management can be accomplished by nonpharmacologic means such as an early vigorous warm-up, the use of a mask for rebreathing warmed air, and participation in a physical training program to increase anaerobic fitness. Pharmacologic management includes the appropriate use of cromolyn sodium, beta-adrenergic agonists, theophylline, ipratromium bromide, and calcium channel blocking agents. In addition, the antihistamine, terfenadine, can be used to block EIB effectively. These pharmacologic agents can be utilized in both national and international competition when approved by the appropriate national governing body or the U.S. Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee.\r"

  ".W": "The distinguishing feature of the allergic person is his or her elevation of serum IgE. This propensity to develop a sustained IgE response is determined genetically. The biologic effects of IgE are mediated via Fc receptors (Fc epsilon R) present on mast cells and basophils (Fc epsilon R type 1) and subpopulations of monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, and platelets (Fc epsilon R type 2). Interaction of allergen with IgE on these cells results in receptor \"bridging\" and the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Fc epsilon R type 2 on lymphocytes and monocytes are upregulated in atopic disease and may play a role in the allergic inflammatory reaction. The activation of B cells to synthesize IgE requires several stages (see Fig. 2). T cells play an important role in the regulation of IgE synthesis. In vitro activation of resting B cells to synthesize IgE requires direct cellular interaction with T cells or the presence of IL4 for activation. The latter effect is inhibited by alpha-interferon. Preactivated B cells are influenced in an isotype-specific manner by T-cell-derived IgE binding factors (IgE-BF), which may act as IgE-potentiating or IgE-suppressive factors, depending on their degree of glycosylation. The regulation of IgE synthesis is an important area of investigation. It provides us with an understanding of the basis of the human allergic response and ultimately may provide the basis for novel strategies in the treatment of allergic diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Table 4 briefly summarizes the relative advantages and disadvantages of skin tests versus in vitro tests for detecting allergen-specific IgE. The skin test remains unexcelled as a sensitive and cost efficient test for specific IgE. The high degree of skin test sensitivity is very important when a patient must be evaluated for potentially life-threatening allergies such as to penicillin or stinging insects. The results of both skin tests and in vitro assays depend very much on the quality of the allergen extracts used for the tests. Although the quality of extracts is improving, there is still little standardization. Both skin tests and in vitro assays are difficult to quality control. Practicing allergists rely on experience, and the correlation between patient histories and skin tests results for quality control of the results. Although this system suffices for common allergens, the results for uncommon allergens may be misleading. Quality control is also difficult for in vitro tests. Participation in quality control programs, such as that being offered by the College of American Pathologists, will increase and lead to better quality and standardization of in vitro test results. At the present time, properly performed skin tests are the best available method for detecting the presence of allergen specific IgE. They are rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive on a per test basis. In vitro tests are acceptable substitutes for skin tests in some circumstances. If the patient does not have normal skin, cannot discontinue interfering medications, or is so sensitive by history that anaphylaxis seems possible, in vitro tests are preferred. In vitro tests are better when it is necessary to test a difficult patient such as a combative, mentally retarded adult. In vitro tests also have been invaluable in many allergy research studies. Physicians must remember that positive tests for allergen-specific IgE do not diagnose allergy. They only indicate the presence of IgE molecules with a particular immunologic specificity. A decision whether the specific IgE molecules are responsible for clinically apparent disease must be made by a well-trained physician. The ultimate standard for the diagnosis of allergic disease remains the combination of: (1) positive double-blind challenge, (2) the presence of specific IgE, and (3) demonstration that the symptoms are the result of IgE-mediated inflammation.\r"

These 5 accounted for 2.8% of the patients with positive CSF viral cultures and 4.8% of those with positive CSF bacterial cultures. All of the viruses were identified as enteroviruses, and the bacteria were Group B Streptococcus, Group D Salmonella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Staphylococcus aureus. The ages of the patients ranged from 10 days to 22 years. The clinical course of each of the illnesses was typical of bacterial meningitis. This relatively high frequency of mixed viral-bacterial meningitis could affect the utility of rapid viral diagnostic tests for CSF viruses.\r"

In our study 137 children received the now recommended 25-micrograms dose of 1 of 4 H. influenzae type b PRP vaccines currently available, and an additional 86 children received half this dose corresponding to the 12.7 micrograms used in 1974. Anti-PRP antibodies were measured in blood samples taken before and 4 weeks after vaccination by the same radioimmunoassay and in the same laboratory as in 1974. The vaccines were equally immunogenic. Furthermore the now recommended dose of 25 micrograms did not give results (geometric mean concentrations, 2.38 to 3.45 micrograms/ml) differing from those after a 12.5-micrograms (2.01- to 3.45-micrograms/ml) dose which was used in 1974. Antibody concentrations of 0.15 and 1.0 micrograms/ml were achieved in 91 to 95 and 66 to 84% of the children, respectively. The corresponding values after 1974 vaccinations were 3.53 micrograms/ml and 100 and 82% of children, respectively. The percentage of those responding with concentrations greater than or equal to 1 microgram/ml was somewhat higher in these Finnish children than reported for children of the same age receiving the same vaccine lots in the United States. Adverse reactions were mild or moderate and transient.\r"

GABHS infection was documented in 35 subjects (4.6%). The classic presentation (as proposed in the 1940s) of GABHS URI in children younger than 3 years of age was not confirmed by this study. In 32 of the GABHS cases there were pharyngitis, common cold symptoms or both, and these were associated with acute otitis media 10 times and with otitis media with effusion 3 times. Clinical impetigo was associated with GABHS URI (4 of 32 cases). GABHS URI would not have been documented in 6 of 32 cases if cultures of the anterior nares had not been performed. Children between 18 and 36 months of age were more likely to have GABHS disease than were younger children. Hoarseness and vomiting occurred less frequently in children younger than 36 months with GABHS infection than in those of that age who had non-beta-hemolytic streptococcal illnesses. A history of two or more siblings at home or a family member with a recent streptococcal infection and the presence of irritability, a reddened throat or palate or uvular edema were each associated with GABHS URI. We concluded that sick children between 18 and 36 months of age with a reddened throat should have cultures taken of the throat and anterior nares for GABHS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four vaccinated children died during 7 to 9 months follow-up as a result of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis, heroin intoxication with concomitant pneumonia, suspected septicemia, and Neisseria meningitidis Group B septicemia. From the actual death rate in children belonging to the same birth cohort in Sweden that could have been eligible for the trial, one death was expected among vaccinated children. Several investigations were carried out to examine the possibility that the deaths could be causally related to the vaccination. The relative risk for hospitalization due to systemic or respiratory infections was 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.20) and 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 1.08) in the vaccine groups as compared with the placebo group. Subsets of the population were studied for signs of immunosuppression. There was no indication of immunoglobulin deficiency or any sign of clinically significant leukopenia or lymphocytosis in vaccine recipients. The results of this analysis provide no evidence for a causal relation between vaccination with the studied acellular pertussis vaccines and altered resistance to invasive disease caused by encapsulated bacteria. The hypothesis that the two variables are related, however, cannot be refuted from these data.\r"

Eighty-eight infants received a dose of 10(4) plaque-forming units of the vaccine, and 88 received the placebo. RRV was well-tolerated but mildly reactogenic in the 10 days after vaccination. There were mild febrile reactions (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C rectally) in 40% of the vaccinees and in 16% of the placebo recipients (P = 0.001). More of the vaccinees had loose stools than did the placebo recipients (P less than 0.05). RRV was immunogenic and induced a 4-fold or greater rise in serum neutralizing antibody responses in 67% of the vaccinees; however, breast-fed infants were less likely to develop a seroresponse than infants who were not breast-fed. Despite the good immunogenicity of RRV the overall incidence of rotavirus-associated illnesses was similar between the vaccine and placebo recipients. The failure of RRV in Rochester may be related to the fact that the circulating rotaviruses were predominantly serotype 1 and RRV is a serotype 3 rotavirus. Because the serotypes of rotavirus that predominate may vary from year to year, a polyvalent preparation may be necessary to provide effective vaccination against rotaviruses.\r"

All infants entering the trial were enrolled in our follow-up clinic and seen at regular intervals for assessment of growth and development, neurologic and sensory status, and incidence of respiratory disease and allergic conditions. Infants have now been followed-up for at least 2 years. Of those infants for whom follow-up is complete, two of 32 (6.3%) surfactant-treated infants died, five (15.6%) had major neuro-developmental handicaps, and five had minor neurodevelopmental handicaps. In the control group, eight of 33 (24%) infants died, whereas only two (6.1%) survived with major neurodevelopmental handicaps, and four (12.1%) were left with minor handicaps. Except for an increased neonatal death rate in the control group, other differences were not statistically significant. The groups were also comparable in terms of the incidence of late respiratory or allergic disease as assessed by history. Treatment with bovine surfactant at birth of premature infants at high risk for respiratory distress syndrome appears to be safe and of short-term benefit, although no decrease in neurodevelopmental handicap at 2 years' follow-up can be demonstrated.\r"

These babies were part of a phenobarbital prophylaxis trial cohort study. Subependymal-intraventricular hemorrhage developed in 17 of the babies. Infants with subependymal-intraventricular hemorrhage, whether or not they received pancuronium or phenobarbital, had coefficients of variation comparable to those of babies without hemorrhage. Coefficient of variation values of the right were comparable to values obtained from the left anterior cerebral artery complex and did not appear to be consistently altered by the presence of subependymal-intraventricular hemorrhage. Coefficient of variation values appeared to be consistently greatest on day 1 and lowest on day 2. In addition, the values overall increased as the number of waves used to determine the coefficient of variation enlarged from five to 20. This phenomena, however, was not seen among pancuronium recipients and suggests that movement artifact may be a determinant of coefficient of variation values. We conclude that, when the best 20 waves are chosen to evaluate the coefficient of variation, no association exists between coefficient of variation values and development of subependymal-intraventricular hemorrhage or administration of phenobarbital.\r"

  ".W": "Newly introduced rapid diagnostic tests for group A streptococcal pharyngitis should facilitate appropriate antimicrobial use in patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Because of high rates of acute pharyngitis in Tuba City, AZ, at the Navajo Indian reservation, the use of rapid diagnostic test was prospectively evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of the test was measured and changes in physician prescribing patterns attributable to use of the test were correlated. Of 320 patients with pharyngitis enrolled during the present 3-week study, 86 met the study's definition of a patient with streptococcal pharyngitis and 163 met the study's definition of a patient with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis. The rapid test was 62.8% sensitive and 96.9% specific in identifying patients from whom group A streptococci were isolated. Although treatment of patients with streptococcal pharyngitis at the time of the first visit increased from 36.5% in a retrospective sample to 72.5% during the study, treatment of patients in whom cultures were negative remained the same. Further analyses showed that physicians tended to treat patients with signs characteristic of streptococcal pharyngitis and, as the study progressed, to rely less on negative rapid test results as a reason to withhold antimicrobial agents. It was concluded that rapid tests with good specificity but limited sensitivity may improve treatment of patients with streptococcal pharyngitis by allowing earlier specific therapy. A more sensitive test with a higher negative predictive value would be necessary to prevent treatment of persons with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal jaundice is one of the most common problems leading to prolonged hospitalization of the newborn. Therefore, an effective low-risk, low-cost therapy reducing hospitalization is highly desirable. Plain dried agar, an extract of seaweed, is low cost and low risk; it can bind bilirubin in the gut, decreasing its enterohepatic circulation, thereby decreasing serum levels. Because of conflicting conclusions in the studies of agar's effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of neonatal jaundice, a meta-analysis of their methodologies was done. Criteria for assessing prospective controlled therapeutic trials of agar were established in six areas: hypothesis and clinical outcome, patient selection, treatment group allocation, therapeutic maneuver, use of cotherapies, and data analysis. Nine prospective clinical trials of agar therapy were evaluated using these six criteria. The seven studies with negative conclusions regarding agar's efficacy failed to meet the criteria in several categories: patient selection, therapeutic maneuver, use of cotherapies, or data analysis. All of the studies, including the positive studies, were at risk for biased treatment allocation. Although the pooled data analysis suggests that prophylactic agar treatment is associated with reduced peak serum bilirubin levels, this observation must be interpreted cautiously in light of heterogenous patient populations and the methodologic problems described. Based on this meta-analysis, agar therapy for neonatal jaundice can neither be recommended nor rejected. The methodologic analysis gives clear guidance for future research concerning the effectiveness of agar in treating neonatal jaundice and provides a model for meta-analysis of other prospective trials in pediatrics.\r"

Increased alkaline phosphatase predominates with Q fever, secondary or tertiary syphilis, clonorchiasis, and hepatic candidiasis, while elevated levels of serum transaminases characterize viral hepatitis, leptospirosis, mononucleosis syndromes, legionnaires' disease, typhoid fever, toxic shock syndrome, and yellow fever. Increases in serum bilirubin are typical with jaundice caused by clostridial myelonecrosis, severe bacterial sepsis, and relapsing fever (borreliosis).

We show that (i) oxidation of cysteine residues in the B subunits is a prerequisite step for in vivo formation of B-subunit pentamers, (ii) reduction of dissociated B subunits in vitro abolishes their ability to reassemble, (iii) the kinetics of B-pentamer assembly in vivo can be mimicked under defined conditions in vitro, (iv) A subunits cannot associate with fully assembled B pentamers in vitro, and (v) A subunits cause an approximately 3-fold acceleration in the rate of B-subunit pentamerization in vivo, implying that A subunits play a coordinating role in the pathway of holotoxin assembly. The last finding is likely to be of general significance, since it provides a mechanism for preferentially excluding or favoring certain intermediates in the assembly of multisubunit proteins.\r"

The chemical synthesis of the 99-residue peptide was carried out by the solid-phase method, and the isolated product was found to exhibit specific proteolytic activity upon folding under reducing conditions. Upon size-exclusion chromatography, enzymatic activity was eluted at a point consistent with a dimeric molecular size. Specificity was demonstrated by the cleavage of the natural substrate HIV gag p55 into gag p24 and gag p17, as well as cleavage of small peptide substrates representing processing sites of HIV fusion proteins.

  ".W": "In Escherichia coli, the final maturation of rRNA occurs in precursor particles, and recent experiments have suggested that ongoing protein synthesis may somehow be required for maturation to occur. The protein synthesis requirement for the formation of the 5' terminus of 23S rRNA has been clarified in vitro by varying the substrate of the reaction. In cell extracts, pre-23S rRNA in free ribosomes was not matured, but that in polysomes was efficiently processed. The reaction occurred in polysomes without the need for an energy source or other additives required for protein synthesis. Furthermore, when polysomes were dissociated into ribosomal subunits, they were no longer substrates for maturation; but the ribosomes became substrates again when they once more were incubated in the conditions for protein synthesis. All of these results are consistent with the notion that protein synthesis serves to form a polysomal complex that is the true substrate for maturation. Ribosomes in polysomes, possibly in the form of 70S initiation complexes, may more easily adopt a conformation that facilitates maturation cleavage. As a result, the rates of ribosome formation and protein synthesis could be coregulated.\r"

  ".U": "89017155\r", 
  ".W": "Pyrimidine-mediated regulation of pyrBI operon expression in Escherichia coli K-12 occurs primarily by an attenuation control mechanism. Previous studies have suggested a model for attenuation control in which low intracellular levels of UTP cause close coupling of transcription and translation within the pyrBI leader region. This close coupling apparently prevents transcriptional termination at an attenuator (a rho-independent transcriptional terminator) located 23 base pairs before the pyrBI structural genes within an open reading frame for a 44-amino acid leader polypeptide. Presumably, a ribosome involved in the synthesis of the leader polypeptide disrupts or precludes the formation of the attenuator-encoded RNA hairpin, which is required for transcriptional termination. In this study, we examined the role of the ribosome in inhibiting transcriptional termination at the pyrBI attenuator. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, we systematically introduced termination codons into the reading frame for the leader polypeptide to determine the distance a ribosome must translate to suppress transcriptional termination. These mutations were incorporated individually into a pyrB::lacZ gene fusion, which was then introduced into the E. coli chromosome. The resulting fusion strains were used to measure the effect of each mutation on pyrB::lacZ expression. The results show that a ribosome must translate to within 14-16 nucleotides of the attenuator-encoded RNA hairpin to inhibit transcriptional termination efficiently, which indicates a direct interaction between the ribosome and the termination hairpin sequence as proposed in the present model. Additional results indicate that factors not included in the present model for attenuation control contribute to the expression and regulation of the pyrBI operon.\r"

(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7131-7135]. We now find that phospholipids derived from membranes lacking an unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., oleic acid) are unable to promote the exchange. This observation correlates strikingly with the long-known effect of 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, a \"suicide analog\" that prevents initiation of a cycle of replication in E. coli by inhibiting the synthesis of oleic acid, an inhibition that can be overcome by providing the cells with oleic acid. Profound influences on the specific binding of dnaA protein to phospholipids by temperature, the content of unsaturated fatty acids, and the inclusion of cholesterol can be explained by the need for the phospholipids to be in fluid-phase vesicles. These findings suggest that membrane attachment of dnaA protein is vital for its function in the initiation of chromosome replication in E. coli.\r"

  ".W": "Proteins from eight eukaryotic families in the cytochrome P-450 superfamily share one region of sequence similarity. This region begins 275-310 amino acids from the amino terminus of each P-450, continues for approximately 170 residues, and ends 35-50 amino acids before the carboxyl terminus. The region can be divided into four domains of sequence similarity, each possessing its own pattern of invariant, conserved, and variable amino acids. The four domains are 56, 20, 59, and 28 residues long and are connected by three shorter segments of limited sequence similarity. The number of residues in these short segments varies with the P-450 protein but ranges from 0 to 20 residues. Consensus sequences based on these similarities can be used to determine whether the sequence of an unidentified peptide resembles that expected for a P-450. Sequence similarities between proteins sometimes reflect constraints imposed by the requirements of a common function. The fourth domain of the P-450s, for example, contains an invariant cysteine that provides the axial thiolate ligand to the heme iron. Other relationships between the four domains and P-450 function can be examined by in vitro mutagenic procedures that alter the conserved amino acids or modify the distance between domains.\r"

The expressed myosin heavy chain and essential myosin light chain copurify through ammonium sulfate fractionation, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The purified complex consists of about 1 mol of light chain per mol of heavy chain. This stoichiometry, which is that of native myosin, suggests that no special eukaryotic machinery is required for coassembly of these two proteins. By coexpressing different myosin heavy chain and myosin light chain combinations, it should be possible to study various isoforms of these two proteins, which are both products of multigene families in mammals. E. coli is thus an ideal system in which to study expression and multimeric assembly of individual components of the eukaryotic contractile apparatus.\r"

  ".W": "Pleiomorphic mouse sarcoma S180 cells were transfected with cDNAs for the liver cell adhesion molecule (L-CAM), the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), or both CAMs. Transfected cells expressed the appropriate CAMs at their surface and those expressing L-CAM (S180L cells) changed from adjoining spindle or round shapes to a closely linked \"epithelioid\" sheet when grown to confluence. Cells transfected with cDNA for N-CAM (S180N cells) also expressed this CAM on the cell surfaces and bound brain vesicles containing N-CAM but showed no phenotypic change to an epithelioid state. In S180L cells and doubly transfected (S180L/N) cells, L-CAM was concentrated at regions of cell contact and was codistributed with cortical actin. In S180N cells, N-CAM was uniformly distributed on the cell surface. When S180L cells were cocultured with S180L/N cells, N-CAM was not concentrated at boundaries between the S180L and S180L/N cells but was concentrated at boundaries between pairs of S180L/N cells. Fab' fragments of anti-L-CAM dissociated the epithelioid sheets of S180L or S180L/N cells into cells with shapes resembling those of untransfected cells. Cells in epithelioid sheets were polygonal in shape but, unlike cells in true epithelia, had no basement membrane or polar structure; they also lacked tight junctions and desmosomes. Ultrastructural examination showed that, in contrast to the untransfected phenotype, cells in epithelioid sheets had large increases in adherens junctions and gap junctions. Dye coupling experiments indicated that the gap junctions were functional. The frequency of expression of both kinds of junctions was sharply decreased by treatment with anti-L-CAM Fab' fragments. These experiments provide support for the precedence hypothesis, which proposes that the linkage of cells by means of CAMs is a necessary event for the extensive expression of junctional structures.\r"

  ".W": "Translational control of the GCN4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by four upstream open reading frames (URFs) present in the leader of GCN4 mRNA. URFs 3 and 4 efficiently repress GCN4 expression in normal growth conditions; URFs 1 and 2 are required to overcome this repression in amino acid-starved cells. lacZ fusions to URFs 3 and 4 were used to determine the translational event that is regulated at these sequences by URFs 1 and 2. URF3-lacZ, URF4-lacZ, and GCN4-lacZ fusions are affected similarly by URFs 1 and 2 when no other URFs are present in the leader: expression from all three fusions is reduced by an amount slightly greater in repressing than in derepressing conditions. These results are inconsistent with models that postulate a differential effect of URFs 1 and 2 on initiation or elongation rates at URFs 3 and 4 versus the GCN4 coding sequences. We propose that the efficiency of reinitiation at the GCN4 AUG codon after translation of URFs 3 and 4 is the translational event that is stimulated in derepressing conditions by URFs 1 and 2.\r"

The plasmid DNA behaved in a manner entirely consistent with the known properties of normal yeast rho- mtDNA after its introduction by high-velocity microprojectile bombardment. Like the mtDNA sequences retained in natural rho- strains, the plasmid DNA in the transformants was reiterated into concatemers whose size was indistinguishable from that of wild-type mtDNA. The oxi1 sequences in the transformants were surrounded by restriction sites derived from the plasmid that were not present in wild-type mtDNA. oxi1 genetic information in these \"synthetic rho-\" strains could be expressed in diploids either after \"marker rescue\" by recombination with rho+ mtDNA carrying an appropriate oxi1 point mutation or in trans during the growth of diploids heteroplasmic for both the plasmid-derived oxi1 sequences and rho+ mtDNA with oxi1 deleted. The ability to generate such \"synthetic rho-\" strains by transformation will allow transfer of mutations generated in vitro to wild-type rho+ mtDNA as well as examination of the function of altered genes in trans.\r"

A high correlation between 5,7-DHT accumulation and aldehyde-induced catecholamine fluorescence as well as tyrosine hydroxylase but not dopamine-beta-hydroxylase or phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase immunoreactivity was found. This indicates that these cells were dopamine-containing neurons. Whole-cell patch recordings showed that all mesencephalic neurons had resting membrane potentials of -50 mV or greater and input resistances ranging between 200 and 700 M omega and exhibited spontaneous action potentials and postsynaptic potentials. The duration of the action potential of the dopamine-containing neurons was characteristically longer than that of the non-dopamine-containing mesencephalic cells. In some dopamine-containing neurons, repolarization of the action potential was clearly biphasic, and the slow phase of repolarization was reversibly blocked by local application of Cd2+ or Co2+. This \"shoulder\" in the action potential was never observed in non-dopamine-containing neurons, where Cd2+ or Co2+ application was always without effect. It is concluded that 5,7-DHT can be used to identify living dopamine-containing neurons in dissociated mesencephalic cultures and these neurons express distinct electrical properties.\r"

PCP and MK-801 block neurotoxicity induced by glutamate doses 50 times higher than the LD50 (LD50 in Mg2+-free medium, 10 microM) but only partially block the kainate neurotoxicity (LD50 in presence of Mg2+, 100 microM). In contrast, pretreatment with gangliosides (GT1b greater than GD1b greater than GM1) results in complete and insurmountable protection against the neurotoxicity elicited by glutamate or kainate. In primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells gangliosides, unlike PCP and MK-801, fail to block glutamate-gated cationic currents and the glutamate-evoked increase of (i) inositol phospholipid hydrolysis (ii) c-fos mRNA content, and (iii) nuclear accumulation of c-fos protein. Protection of glutamate neurotoxicity by gangliosides does not require their presence in the incubation medium; however, it is proportional to the amount of glycosphingolipid accumulated in the neuronal membranes. The ganglioside concentration (30-60 microM) that blocks glutamate-elicited neuronal death also prevents glutamate- and kainate-induced protein kinase C translocation from cytosol to neuronal membranes.\r"

To determine whether exocytosis from acetylcholine-containing small synaptic vesicles and from CGRP-containing large dense-core vesicles can be independently stimulated, nerve-muscle preparations were exposed to alpha-latrotoxin. This toxin induced complete depletion of acetylcholine-containing small synaptic vesicles but did not induce a parallel depletion of CGRP-like immunoreactivity and of large dense-core vesicles. These effects were independent of the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and occurred both at room temperature and at low temperature (1-3 degrees C). These findings suggest that exocytosis from the two vesicle populations is mediated by distinct biochemical mechanisms, which might be differentially regulated by physiological stimuli.\r"

Here, the quaternary structure of the transmembrane core of the receptor was investigated by chemically crosslinking its subunits. Upon treatment with crosslinking reagents of different side-chain specificities and lengths, a consistent set of adducts up to Mr 260,000 was detected after separation by NaDodSO4/PAGE. The observed pattern of adducts was similar irrespective of whether purified receptor protein or synaptosomal membranes were crosslinked. Compositional analysis revealed that the crosslinked adducts contained the Mr 48,000 and 58,000 subunits in varying ratios but not the peripheral Mr 93,000 polypeptide. Thus adducts of intermediate molecular weight represent dimers, trimers, and tetramers of the transmembrane subunits, whereas the major adduct of Mr 260,000 corresponds to a pentameric assembly of subunits forming the ion channel of the glycine receptor. This subunit arrangement is similar to that reported for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of fish electric organ and skeletal muscle. Hence, we suggest that the different ligand-gated ion channels of excitable membranes share a similar quaternary structure.\r"

We now show that, in the absence of these initiating molecules, monocytes and cell lines of monocytic/myeloid differentiation can alternatively initiate coagulation after exposure to ADP. The molecular basis for this procoagulant response consists of two distinct events. First, cell stimulation with ADP induces high-affinity binding of coagulation factor X to the surface-adhesive receptor Mac-1. Locally, Mac-1-concentrated factor X is then rapidly proteolytically cleaved to an active protease with size and activity characteristics of activated factor X, which supports the cell-associated formation of thrombin and the procoagulant response. We conclude that the monocytic/myeloid adhesive receptor Mac-1 has the unexpected, specifically inducible property to organize a molecular assembly culminating in rapid fibrin formation that is independently regulated from tissue factor and factor VII/activated factor VII.\r"

Using RNA transfer blot analysis, we demonstrate that alpha 1(IX) and alpha 2(IX) mRNAs are expressed by corneal epithelial cells at the time that the primary stromal components are synthesized. The levels of the mRNAs decrease with increasing developmental age and are barely detectable at day 11 of development. In contrast, type IX collagen protein is detectable by immunofluorescence at days 5 and 6 and undetectable by day 8. Using probes specific for alpha 1(IX) and alpha 2(IX) mRNAs, we demonstrate that the size of alpha 2(IX) mRNA is the same in cornea as in chondrocytes, the major source of type IX collagen. However, the alpha 1(IX) mRNA is about 700 nucleotides shorter in the cornea than in cartilage because the corneal form of the mRNA does not contain the 5' region that encodes the non-triple-helical amino-terminal globular domain of cartilage type IX collagen. Therefore, corneal type IX collagen must lack this domain. This structural modulation of an extracellular matrix protein is likely to contribute to the functional differences between cartilage matrix and the early corneal stroma, both of which are rich in type II collagen.\r"

In addition to growth inhibition, these drugs induce high levels of homologous recombination and induce the expression of a DNA damage-inducible gene DIN3. Cytotoxicity of the drugs is more pronounced in strains that also carry a rad52 mutation. An analog of mAMSA), which is ineffective as an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II in mammalian cells, is also ineffective in eliciting physiological responses in these yeast strains. The physiological effects of camptothecin, but not those of mAMSA, disappear if the TOP1 gene encoding DNA topoisomerase I is disrupted. This shows that DNA topoisomerase I is the sole target of camptothecin cytotoxicity and illustrates that a nonessential enzyme can nevertheless be the target for a cytotoxic drug.\r"

This stimulation assay has been used to purify the yeast analog of PCNA/cyclin (yPCNA) to homogeneity. yPCNA is a trimer or tetramer (Mr approximately 82,000) of identical subunits with a denatured Mr of 26,000. On a molar basis yPCNA and calf thymus PCNA/cyclin are equally active in stimulating DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase III. About 10 times more yPCNA than calf thymus PCNA/cyclin is needed, however, to stimulate calf thymus DNA polymerase delta, and the degree of stimulation obtained at saturating levels of yPCNA is a factor of 2-3 less than with calf thymus PCNA/cyclin. Both stimulatory proteins exert their effect in an identical fashion, i.e., by increasing the processivity of the DNA polymerase. Yeast DNA polymerases I and II and calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha are not stimulated by yPCNA. Treatment of logarithmic-phase cells with hydroxyurea blocks them in the S phase and produces a 4- to 5-fold increase in yPCNA.\r"

Receptor cDNAs encoding the entire hIR ectodomain, the alpha subunit of the hIR alone, or a portion of the alpha subunit containing the cysteine-rich region were placed within an expression vector and in turn used to transfect CHO cells. Only cells expressing mRNA for the entire hIR ectodomain secreted hIR-related protein, suggesting that the truncated versions of this domain are unstable. The ectodomain molecules were extensively glycosylated, properly processed heterotetramers. Further, they bound insulin with an affinity similar to that of the intact hIR. In the electron microscope the secreted ectodomains appeared as discrete globular structures. After incubation with roughly equimolar quantities of insulin, the ectodomains associated to form loops or branched and folded linear macroarrays. However, these structures were not restricted to the specific ligand, insulin, since epidermal growth factor also produced the effect. Nevertheless, it seems that the receptor ectodomains can exist in two structural states. The conversion of the singular to the aggregated state may somehow be associated with transmembrane communication and activation of the biological response.\r"

The number and properties of these proteases are the subjects of this report. We have identified and characterized two distinct protease activities in a crude matrix fraction from rat liver: processing protease I, which cleaves these precursors to the corresponding intermediate form; and processing protease II, which cleaves the intermediate forms to mature subunits. Protease I is insensitive to chelation by EDTA and to inactivation with N-ethylmaleimide; protease II is inhibited by 5 mM EDTA and is inactivated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. We have prepared from mitochondrial matrix an 800-fold-enriched protease I fraction free of protease II activity by using the following steps: ion exchange, hydroxyapatite, molecular sieving, and hydrophobic chromatography. Using similar procedures, we also have prepared an approximately 2000-fold-enriched protease II fraction, which has a trace amount of contaminating protease I. This enriched protease II fraction has little or no cleavage activity toward mitochondrial precursors but rapidly and efficiently converts intermediate forms to mature size. Finally, we show that protease I alone is sufficient to cleave the precursor of a third nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein subunit--the beta subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase [propanoyl-CoA:carbon dioxide ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.4.1.3]--to its mature size.\r"

  ".W": "A 537-base cDNA encoding a portion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (acetyl-CoA:dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.12) was isolated from a lambda gt11 yeast cDNA library by immunoscreening. This cDNA was subcloned and used as a probe to screen a lambda gt11 yeast genomic DNA library. Two overlapping clones were used to determine the complete sequence of the acetyltransferase gene. The composite sequence has an open reading frame of 1446 nucleotides encoding a presequence of 28 amino acids and a mature protein of 454 amino acids (Mr = 48,546). The deduced amino acid sequence contains the experimentally determined amino acid sequences of the amino terminus and two internal peptide fragments of the acetyltransferase. Hybridization analysis of yeast genomic DNA showed that the gene has a single copy. A 915-base segment of the acetyltransferase gene hybridized to a yeast mRNA of approximately equal to 1.6 kilobases. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase revealed a multidomain structure similar to those reported for the corresponding acetyltransferases from Escherichia coli and rat liver, and extensive sequence similarity among the three enzymes. However, the yeast enzyme contains only one lipoyl domain, in contrast to three lipoyl domains reported for the E. coli enzyme and apparently two for the rat liver enzyme.\r"

The HisM200----Leu RC, which has a heterodimer consisting of a bacteriochlorophyll and a bacteriopheophytin, is capable of the primary photochemistry observed in wild-type Rb. capsulatus RCs, but with an overall quantum yield reduced by about half. The lower yield resides in the initial electron transfer reaction and may be associated in part with substantial charge transfer character of the excited heterodimer. These and other comparisons between Rb. capsulatus wild-type and HisM200----Leu RCs have important implications for our understanding of the mechanism of electron transfer in the RC and the efficiency of the charge separation process.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular and viral oncogenes are usually defined on the basis of their ability to elicit neoplastic transformation. However, oncogene activity has also been implicated in the control of differentiation. We have tested whether transfection of primary cultured granulosa cells with various oncogenes can yield cell lines that maintain their differentiated properties. Primary granulosa cells were prepared from diethylstilbestrol-treated immature female rats and transfected with simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA or with SV40 plus activated human Ha-RAS oncogene. Transfection with SV40 plus Ha-RAS yielded cell lines that lost response to gonadotropins but, after 48 hr of stimulation with isoproterenol, cholera toxin, forskolin, or 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), produced progesterone at levels comparable to those of differentiated primary cells. In contrast, cells transformed only by SV40 lost their ability to produce progesterone. Whereas in primary cell cultures progesterone production was already evident after a 3-hr incubation with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP, in cotransfected cells progesterone production became evident only after 12 hr. All cotransformed cell lines produced SV40 large tumor antigen as well as human RAS p21 protein. The expression of the expected oncogenes in the various cell lines was confirmed by mRNA analysis. These results suggest that the expression of an activated RAS oncogene in granulosa cells can play a role in preserving inducible steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "89017251\r", 
  ".W": "JC virus (JCV) is a ubiquitous human papovavirus that shares sequence and structural homology with simian virus 40 (SV40). In contrast to SV40, expression of JCV is restricted to a small number of cell types, including human fetal glial cells, uroepithelial cells, amnion cells, and some endothelial cells. To study the control of JCV early region expression, we made heterokaryons and stable hybrids between JCV-transformed hamster glial cells and mouse fibroblasts. Binucleate heterokaryons exhibited extinction of large tumor antigen expression in the hamster nuclei as assayed by indirect immunofluorescence. This extinction was both time and dose dependent: extinction reached maximal levels at 24-36 hr after fusion and was dependent on the ratio of glial cell to fibroblast nuclei in multinucleated heterokaryons. Extinction also was observed in stable hybrids between the glial cells and mouse Ltk- cells. Southern blot analysis showed that the extinguished hybrids contained viral sequences. Reexpression of large tumor antigen was observed in several subclones, suggesting that extinction was correlated with the loss of murine fibroblast chromosomes from these hybrids. The cis-acting region that mediates extinction resides within the viral regulatory region, which contains two 98-base-pair repeats that have enhancer activity. These data demonstrate that cellular factors that negatively regulate viral gene expression contribute to the restricted cell-type specificity of this virus.\r"

We have constructed a series of derivatives of the phoA gene that code for a wild-type signal sequence but result in altered amino acid sequences at the amino terminus of the mature alkaline phosphatase. Our results suggest that the presence of two positively charged amino acids very early in the mature sequence interferes significantly with protein export. In one case, phoA2AB, the presence of the sequence Arg-Ile-Arg at the amino terminus of alkaline phosphatase results in a 50-times reduction in the export of the protein. By using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, we have constructed mutant derivatives of phoA2AB that are greatly enhanced for export. In all cases, these derivatives reduce the net positive charge in the region. Our results may explain the failure of E. coli to export a number of proteins coded for by artificial constructs and suggest a way to improve export in these cases.\r"

The tissue-specific pattern of HLA-B7 RNA expression was similar to that of endogenous class I H-2 genes, although the HLA-B7 gene was about 10-fold underexpressed in liver. Identical patterns of RNA expression were detected whether the HLA-B7 gene contained 12 or 0.66 kilobase(s) (kb) of 5' flanking sequence. The level of expression was copy number dependent and as efficient as that of H-2 genes; gamma interferon enhanced HLA-B7 RNA expression in parallel to that of H-2. In addition to the mechanism(s) responsible for gamma interferon-enhanced expression, there must be at least one other tissue-specific mechanism controlling the constitutive levels of class I RNA. Tissue-specific human beta 2m RNA expression was similar to that of mouse beta 2m, including high-level expression in liver. Cell surface HLA-B7 increased 10- to 17-fold on T cells and on a subset of thymocytes from HLA-B7/B2M doubly transgenic mice compared to HLA-B7 singly transgenic mice. The pattern of expression of HLA-B7 on thymocytes resembled that of H-2K as opposed to H-2D. These results confirm that coexpression of both human chains is required for efficient surface expression and that HLA-B7 may share a regulatory mechanism with H-2K, which distinguishes it from H-2D.\r"

The established rat thymic epithelial cell line IT-45 R1 produced a polypeptide that resolves as a single band in the region of 11 kDa on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. This molecule, which we have named thymotaxin, induced a chemotactic response in a subpopulation of hemopoietic cells from juvenile rat bone marrow. Responding cells were generated by short-term coculture of rat bone marrow hemopoietic cells with mouse bone marrow stroma in a steroid-free medium. Cells selected in a chemotactic chamber have a lymphoid or blast cell morphology. The phenotype of the responding cells is Thy-1+, CD4- [corrected] and CD8-. In contrast, CD8 T-lymphocyte differentiation antigen was expressed after coculture with embryonic thymic monolayers, suggesting that the responding cells correspond to the precursors colonizing the thymus.\r"

Substitution of Asp20 or deletion of Phe124 resulted in inactive analog proteins that were unable to interact with the high-affinity p55/p70 complex or the intermediate-affinity p70 subunit of the interleukin 2 receptor. These analogs, however, retained the capacity to compete for binding to the low-affinity p55 subunit. The presence of the carboxylic acid in the side chain of Asp20 was necessary for effective binding to the p70 protein. In contrast, substitution of Trp121 and Leu17 created analogs that were inactive in the bioassay and all three binding assays. The effects of these mutations on protein conformation were assessed by circular dichroism. These results demonstrate that specific residues in the NH2 and COOH termini of interleukin 2 are crucial for its structure and activity.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo rejection responses are initiated by specific T-cell recognition of foreign histocompatibility antigens expressed by tissue allografts, but it is not certain if the effector mechanism mediating the actual tissue injury is also antigen-specific. To directly assess the specificity of the effector phase of in vivo rejection responses, we constructed B6 in equilibrium with A/J allophenic mice that are genetic mosaics whose individual cells express either H-2b or H-2a histocompatibility antigens but not both. Trunk skin from B6 in equilibrium with A/J allophenic mice was grafted onto immunoincompetent H-2b nude mice and allowed to heal and regrow hair that was both black and white, reflecting the genetic mosaicism of the allophenic grafts. One month after engraftment, the H-2b nude animals were reconstituted with syngeneic H-2b T cells reactive against H-2a allodeterminants. An obvious rejection response ensued involving antigen-nonspecific inflammatory destruction of the epidermis and complete hair loss. Despite the intensity of the nonspecific inflammatory response, the allophenic skin grafts survived. Importantly, the allophenic grafts regrew hair and the predominant color of that hair was black, providing visual proof that syngeneic B6 melanocytes and hair follicle cells had not been destroyed. Thus, these results demonstrate that although the intense inflammatory component of skin graft rejection responses is capable of damaging superficial epidermal cells nonspecifically, it does not cause rejection of skin allografts. Rather, rejection of skin allografts is mediated by antigen-specific effector T cells that assess individual cells within the dermis of the graft for expression of foreign histocompatibility antigens.\r"

  ".W": "The genes for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A chain, B chain/c-sis, and the PDGF receptor are expressed in human malignant glioma cell lines. In the present investigation we have studied the expression of these genes in biopsy specimens from human glioblastomas. Hyperplasia of the vascular endothelium is a prominent characteristic of human glioblastoma multiforme and simian sarcoma virus-induced gliomas in primates. RNA transfer blot analysis of biopsies from glioblastoma multiforme showed transcripts for PDGF A and B chains and the PDGF receptor. Tissue sections from this tumor examined by in situ hybridization techniques revealed that the proliferating vascular endothelial cells contained large quantities of mRNA for PDGF B chain/c-sis and its receptor and, to a lesser extent, for PDGF A chain. In contrast, the tumor cells expressed more mRNA for PDGF A chain than for PDGF B chain and PDGF receptor. The latter two were also expressed at higher levels in glioma cells than in glial cells of nontumorous human brain tissue. Thus, an autocrine stimulation by the PDGF B chain/c-sis product via its receptor, evoked by interaction with surrounding glioma cells, could be the mechanism behind the pathological proliferation of endothelial cells characteristically found in this type of malignancy.\r"

Seventy-one distinctive electrophoretic types, representing multilocus genotypes, were identified. A basically clonal population structure was indicated by the presence of strong linkage disequilibrium among enzyme loci, the association of each serotype with a relatively small number of multilocus enzyme genotypes, and the global distribution of certain genotypes. For each of six of the serotypes, 83-96% of isolates were members of a single clone. The occurrence of each of four serotypes (S. derby, S. enteritidis, S. infantis, and S. newport) in isolates of clones belonging to several evolutionary lineages, some of which are distantly related, suggests that the horizontal transfer and recombination of chromosomal genes mediating expression of cell-surface antigens has been a significant process in the evolution of the salmonellae. Two divergent clone clusters of S. derby differ in the relative frequency with which they cause disease in birds versus mammals, and two major lineages of S. newport differ in the frequency with which their clones are associated with disease in humans versus animals.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes-associated peptide has recently been isolated and characterized from the amyloid of the islets of Langerhans in type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetics, and immunoreactivity with antibodies to the peptide has been demonstrated in islet B cells of both normal and type 2 diabetic subjects. In view of the evidence presented in this paper that this 37-amino acid peptide may be a hormone present in normal individuals, we now propose the name \"amylin\" to replace \"diabetes-associated peptide.\" Because increased amylin, deposited as amyloid within the islets of Langerhans, is characteristic of type 2 diabetes, the study below was performed to examine the possible effects of amylin on peripheral glucose metabolism. Whole amylin was synthesized by using solid-phase techniques, with formation of the disulfide linkage by oxidation in dilute aqueous solution and recovery of the peptide by lyophilization. The effects of amylin on glucose metabolism were studied in two preparations in vitro, isolated rat soleus muscle strips and isolated rat adipocytes. In skeletal muscle exposed to 120 nM amylin for 1 hr, there was a marked decrease in both basal and submaximally insulin-stimulated rates of glycogen synthesis, which resulted in significant reduction in the rates of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In muscles treated with amylin there was no response at the concentration of insulin required to stimulate glucose uptake half-maximally in untreated (control) muscles. In marked contrast, amylin had no effect on either basal or insulin-stimulated rates of glucose incorporation into either CO2 or triacylglycerol in isolated adipocytes. Therefore, amylin may be a factor in the etiology of the insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus, as both deposition of the peptide in islet amyloid and decreased rates of glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle are characteristic of this condition.\r"

Male-line transgenic mice had higher levels of cells in the peritoneal cavity and a higher frequency of spleen enlargement with excess erythropoiesis than female-line mice and uniquely developed fibrotic nodules in the abdominal and pleural cavities. The various diseases in GM-CSF transgenic mice are likely to have been induced by GM-CSF-stimulated products of macrophages, and in the two transgenic lines the macrophages exhibit characteristic differences in morphology and possibly functional activity.\r"

The procedure is very effective in cases of minimal to moderate eyelid ptosis (3 mm or less) and in the presence of normal levator function. The patients, following a thorough clinical evaluation, are tested using 2.5% phenylephrine eyedrop solution, which acts as an extremely useful prognostic indicator. Depending on the degree of ptosis and the response to phenylephrine, 6 to 9 mm of combined Muller's muscle and conjunctiva is resected using a specially designed clamp under local or attended local anesthesia (no tarsal plate is resected). The incision is repaired using a running 6-0 Prolene horizontal mattress technique, and the ends are brought up through the skin and tied over the tarsal plate. In the treatment of 43 eyelids, with the exception of one slight overcorrection, there were no complications encountered with this simple procedure. Excellent results can be expected in properly selected patients, and recovery time is minimal. Our success in the last 4 years with this modified procedure allows us to strongly recommend it for the correction of mild to moderate ptosis when there is an acceptable response to phenylephrine.\r"

For injuries involving the anterior wall of the sinus in which the nasofrontal duct is patent, the anterior wall is reconstituted either primarily or using a bone graft. Injuries involving the posterior wall of the frontal sinus generally necessitate a craniotomy; the frontal sinus in these situations is cranialized and the nasofrontal duct is plugged. In primary injuries of the frontal sinus in which the nasofrontal duct is badly damaged but the posterior sinus wall intact and in late mucoceles or mucopyoceles, all sinus mucosa is stripped and the sinus is packed with cancellous bone. The authors feel that cancellous bone is a better material than fat with which to pack a sinus, particularly in the face of active infection. Three cases are presented in which infected mucopyoceles draining to the skin were treated with removal of all sinus mucosa and packing with cancellous bone, with primary healing.\r"

This study compared the regeneration achieved after 1 year in 16 monkeys across a 3-cm upper arm ulnar nerve gap with a bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid nerve conduit with the regeneration achieved with a classical interfascicular interpositional sural nerve graft. The results demonstrated electrophysiologic and histologic evidence of neural regeneration across the gaps in all experimental groups. The bioabsorbable nerve conduit groups and the sural nerve graft group had mean fiber diameters, amplitudes, and conduction velocities each significantly less than those of normal control ulnar nerves. There was, however, no significant difference between any of the experimental groups. Electromyography demonstrated recovery of 19 of the 28 (68 percent) intrinsic muscles studied. These results demonstrate that the primate peripheral nerve can regenerate across short nerve gaps when guided by an appropriate nerve conduit, suggesting that a single-stage biodegradable polyglycolic acid conduit may be used as an alternative to a short interfascicular nerve graft.\r"

Raw milk was the major source of infection. The major features on presentation, irrespective of the course of the disease, were fever, sweating, headache, rigors, arthralgia, myalgia, and low back pain. Hepatosplenomegaly was present in 41 per cent of cases and in 32 per cent neither liver nor spleen were palpable. The haematologic findings were not specific and hepatic dysfunction (shown by liver enzyme abnormalities) was common. Skeletal (26 per cent) and genital (8.5 per cent) changes and neurobrucellosis (7 per cent) were the major complications. The ELISA was the most sensitive and reliable diagnostic test especially in relation to chronic brucellosis and neurobrucellosis. ELISA allowed the determination of brucella-specific immunoglobulins (Ig)G, IgM and IgA in the CSF, and provided profiles of Ig, in sera, which were different in patients with chronic (elevated IgG and IgA) from those with acute (elevated IgM alone or IgG, IgM and IgA) brucellosis. Treatment with tetracycline, doxycycline or rifampicin gave a cure rate of over 91 per cent in acute and subacute brucellosis. Co-trimoxazole was associated with a relapse rate of 50 per cent. Two drug combinations of streptomycin and tetracycline, streptomycin and rifampicin or streptomycin and doxycycline were effective, but one of five patients with chronic brucellosis relapsed. A combination of streptomycin, tetracycline and rifampicin with or without steroids was used successfully in neurobrucellosis, septicaemic shock and subacute bacterial endocarditis.\r"

This sometimes resulted in diagnostic and therapeutic delay and irreversible organ damage. Antibodies to components of neutrophil cytoplasm--recently demonstrated to be specific for Wegener's granulomatosis--were detected by indirect immunofluorescence in 10 of 11 patients, and it appears likely that antibodies to components of neutrophil cytoplasm will prove to be of great value in early diagnosis.\r"

However, when normal subjects had been hyperglycaemic for two hours, their first-phase responses were similar to those of the patients. Six patients were subsequently treated by diet alone, six by diet and tolbutamide and six by diet and metformin. There was no improvement in first-phase responses after treatment, but second-phase responses doubled. Improved responses were seen with all treatments, and correlated with the fall in fasting blood glucose concentration during treatment. This study supports the view that hyperglycaemia impairs beta-cell function and suggests that first-phase responses are more sensitive to hyperglycaemia than second-phase responses.\r"

  ".U": "89017807\r", 
  ".W": "Osteoarthritis may be divided into primary generalized and secondary forms. Primary generalized osteoarthritis is characterized by narrowing of cartilage, marginal osteophytes, and absence of erosions. The most common sites of involvement are the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers and the first carpometacarpal joint. Secondary osteoarthritis also results in narrowing of cartilage in the absence of erosions, but in regions of mechanical stress. Erosive osteoarthritis affects predominantly the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, and evolves into bony fusion in 12 to 15 per cent of cases, about the same percentage of interphalangeal bony fusion that occurs in psoriatic arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis predominates in the axial skeleton where it eventually leads to fusion of the vertebrae and sacroiliac joints. Psoriatic arthritis combines many features of rheumatoid arthritis, in which synovial inflammation predominates, and ankylosing spondylitis, in which ligamentous inflammation predominates. The hands and feet are involved to an equal extent, and in 20 per cent of patients the disorder also involves the sacroiliac joints and spine. Reiter's disease, like psoriatic arthritis, differs from ankylosing spondylitis in its inconstant involvement of the spine and greater involvement of peripheral joints. Reiter's disease differs from psoriatic arthritis in its predominant involvement of the lower limbs, particularly the feet, with relative sparing of the hands and wrists. Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a rare disorder in which polyarthritis usually precedes the onset of nodular cutaneous eruptions, a fact that emphasizes the importance of early roentgenologic recognition. The interphalangeal joints are the predominant sites of involvement in the hands, but eventually all of the synovium lined joints become affected, with arthritis mutilans the end result in one third of cases. The erosions are strikingly symmetrical and well circumscribed, and accompanying osteoporosis is disproportionately mild. Progressive systemic sclerosis is characterized by atrophy and dystrophic calcifications in the soft tissues, ultimately leading to joint deformities and resorption of the terminal tufts of the phalanges. Resorption of bone occurs at other sites as well, and marginal erosions may develop in the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the hands.\r"

Involvement of an articulation may occur by one of four mechanisms: hematogenous spread, spread from a contiguous source of infection, direct implantation, or postoperative contamination. Distribution is typically monoarticular with a swollen, erythematous, and painful joint. The radiographic differential diagnosis includes limited rheumatoid arthritis, gout, synovial osteochondromatosis, and pigmented villonodular synovitis. In order to prevent complications, including growth disturbances, articular destruction with ankylosis, osteomyelitis, or soft tissue extension, early diagnostic arthrocentesis is important. Radiographic abnormalities, which include soft tissue swelling, joint space loss, periarticular osteopenia, and central or marginal osseous erosions, may be delayed following clinical onset of infection. Advanced imaging techniques such as scintigraphy, CT, or MRI may allow accurate diagnosis of the infectious process at an earlier stage.\r"

They termed the condition \"pseudogout.\" It was noted that this was often associated with chondrocalcinosis and it was commonly held that cartilage calcification had to be present if the diagnosis was to be suggested on the basis of the radiographic findings. Subsequently, a clinical and radiographic pattern has emerged in which the diagnosis of CPPD deposition disease can be suggested in the absence of chondrocalcinosis. This condition is termed pyrophosphate arthropathy and is differentiated from degenerative disease by the pattern and distribution of the joint disease. It is important to recognize CPPD deposition disease because of its association with other diseases, such as hemochromatosis and hyperparathyroidism. Although painful periarticular tendinous calcification (peritendinitis calcarea) resulting from the deposition of calcium HA crystals has long been recognized, it has only recently been discovered that intra-articular HA can be associated with an acute inflammatory synovitis. Additionally, patients are now being identified who have CPPD deposition at one anatomic location and HA deposition at another. Differentiation of these various types of crystal-induced arthropathies should lead to more effective therapy in the future.\r"
