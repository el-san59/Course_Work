  ".W": "Percutaneous stimulation of the motor cortex has been used to assess directly the supranuclear projection to the sternomastoid, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles. The projection to sternomastoid had a mean latency of 6.5 ms for the contralateral electromyographic response. A smaller and more variable response, usually with a longer latency (mean 9.5 ms), occurred in the ipsilateral sternomastoid. Electromyographic responses on both sides were potentiated by voluntary contraction or strong inspiratory efforts. They were evoked at lower stimulus intensities in the contralateral sternomastoid. Short-latency responses were recorded from the contralateral but not the ipsilateral trapezius and splenius capitis muscles. These results indicate that weakness of head rotation towards the hemiplegic limb following a supranuclear lesion may reflect reduced power of dorsal neck muscles rather than of sternomastoid.\r"

The clinical features included confusion and/or clouding of consciousness, marked oppositional hypertonus ('gegenhalten') and myoclonus. Because of the frequent coexistence of other alcoholic encephalopathies in the same patient, alcoholic pellagra was often unrecognized. Fifteen patients received thiamine and pyridoxine therapy without niacin. It appeared to aggravate the neurological state or to trigger the development of alcoholic pellagra encephalopathy in 9 cases. The relationship between pellagra occurring during thiamine and pyridoxine therapy and 'nicotinic acid deficiency' is discussed. Multiple vitamin therapy should be given in the treatment of undiagnosed encephalopathies in alcoholic patients.\r"

  ".W": "In 22 patients with alcoholic encephalopathies, chromatolysis similar to that reported in endemic pellagra was found on postmortem examination. No gross macroscopic changes were seen in affected areas and only neurons were involved. The changes consisted of central chromatolysis, seen predominantly in the brainstem, especially in the pontine nuclei, where they were constant, and in the cerebellar dentate nuclei. Nuclei of cranial nerves (mainly the third, sixth, seventh and eighty), the reticular nuclei, arcuate nuclei and posterior horn cells, were also markedly affected. Changes were sometimes seen in the cerebral cortex, the interpeduncular nuclei, the central mesencephalic grey matter, the colliculi, the tenth and twelfth cranial nerve and perihypoglossal nuclei, the gracile and cuneate nuclei and anterior horn cells. This distribution was different from that reported in endemic and 'endogenous' pellagra or in isoniazid-induced pellagra encephalopathy. Central chromatolysis was the only pertinent finding of the CNS examination in 9 cases. In 8 cases, chromatolysis was associated with Marchiafava-Bignami encephalopathy, in 4 cases with Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy, and in 1 other case with both. Mild degeneration of spinal cord tracts was seen in 3 cases. The chromatolysis of alcoholic pellagra did not appear to be a retrograde change related to axonal degeneration. Systemic examination showed liver changes in 15/16 cases. Treatment of these cases had not included niacin. No differences were found between cases given thiamine and pyridoxine and those which had not. Microscopic examination of the pons is essential in alcoholic encephalopathies.\r"

  ".W": "In a group of 16 cases with adult-onset chronic proximal spinal muscular atrophy, we performed a morphometric analysis of 88 intramuscular nerves in biopsied biceps brachii muscles and correlated this analysis with clinical and histochemical parameters. The total number of large and small myelinated fibres in all fascicles was reduced to 71%, 23% and 83% of control values, respectively. The percentage reduction of large myelinated fibres for each case was significantly correlated with duration of illness, biceps muscle power and histochemical atrophy factors. Histograms of large intramuscular nerve fascicles showed unimodal distributions and shifts to the left with single peak increases at 1 micron. The densities of small myelinated fibres in large fascicles correlated with counts of 'enclosed' muscle fibres in ATPase preparations. Compared with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a lesser reduction of large myelinated fibres, but a greater increase in small myelinated fibres, was noted in adult-onset chronic proximal spinal muscular atrophy. These findings imply that there is a less marked loss of myelinated nerve fibres with more effective reinnervation in adult-onset chronic proximal spinal muscular atrophy than in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Time domain and frequency domain analyses were performed on smoothed and averaged electromyographic (IEMG) activity recorded intramuscularly from 6 muscles of the lips, tongue and jaw during speech in normal and athetoid cerebral palsy subjects. The speech IEMG waveforms in both groups were composed of slowly changing tonic activity merging with more rapidly changing phasic bursts. Significant increases both in the durations and average levels of IEMG activity in the athetoid subjects resulted in a 5- to 30-fold increase in the speech muscle energy expended by these subjects. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of the IEMG activity were significantly increased in the athetoid subjects, commensurate with their increased average levels, thus demonstrating that they could vary their muscle contraction levels over a wide range. The velocities (rates of change) of muscle IEMG activity did not differ significantly between the two groups. The velocity of the IEMG activity increased linearly with its amplitude in both subject groups, but the durations of the IEMG bursts nevertheless were highly variable. The slope of the velocity-amplitude relation in the athetoid subjects was less than half that in the normal subjects, suggesting that the frequency bandwidth of muscle activity was reduced in the athetoid subjects, despite a normal range of IEMG velocities. The frequency analysis confirmed this suggestion. The upper limit of the average frequency spectrum of voluntary muscle activity for speech was 7 Hz in the normal subjects, whereas this limit was 4 Hz in the athetoid subjects. In the normal subjects each muscle had a different frequency spectrum, whereas the spectra for the 6 muscles were remarkably uniform in the athetoid subjects, implying an abnormality in the functional organization of their muscles. The findings of this study showed clearly that the temporospatial patterns of voluntary muscle activity in the athetoid subjects were grossly abnormal. Since this voluntary activity was reproducible across multiple repetitions of the same speech sample, the dysarthria in these speakers may be attributed to abnormal control of voluntary activity, not to involuntary movement. The results support the view that the primary disability in cerebral palsy is a disruption of the physiological mechanisms which subserve the acquisition of motor skills.\r"

Subsequently, these motor neurons underwent a progressive subacute degeneration that occurred over a period of 35-39 days. Combined electrophysiological and neuropathological methods indicated that dorsal root ganglion cells were relatively unaffected by this dose of toxin.

On the second scan (3 to 5 weeks later), persisting enhancement was seen in only 12/54 lesions which enhanced on the first scan. No lesion showed persisting enhancement on the third scan (after 6 months). Enhancement occurred in all 12 new lesion areas seen on the unenhanced second scan and in 8 of 15 new lesions seen on the third scan. Enhancement was also seen in 4 older lesions which had been nonenhancing on earlier scans. Relaxation time measurements demonstrated a high water content in some nonenhancing lesions, which could be due to a subtle blood-brain barrier disturbance not detected with Gd-DTPA. The results show that blood-brain barrier impairment is a consistent finding in new MS lesions detected with MRI. Gd-DTPA is a useful marker of new and biologically active lesions and should prove of value in monitoring therapeutic trials in MS.\r"

This study confirms that conscious-sedation analgesia provides suitable conditions for craniotomies when brain mapping is required.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied 20 surgical patients to determine the effect of large doses of vecuronium on plasma histamine concentrations. Patients were unpremedicated and anaesthetized with nitrous oxide and halothane via a mask. Tracheal intubation was performed without the use of muscle relaxants. Fifteen min later and before surgery had begun, vecuronium, in doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg.kg-1 (n = 10 for each dose), was administered as an IV bolus. Arterial blood samples were obtained prior to and 2, 5, and 10 min after vecuronium administration and analyzed for plasma histamine by a radioenzymatic method. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously. In one patient who received 0.1 mg.kg-1 of vecuronium, plasma histamine concentrations at 2 min were 275 per cent of the control histamine value but fell below control at 10 min. This increase in plasma histamine was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure or heart rate. As a group, study patients had no significant changes in plasma histamine concentrations with either dose of vecuronium. In addition, mean plasma histamine values for each sampling interval did not differ between the two patient groups. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased significantly at 10 min in patients receiving vecuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1, and at 2 and 10 min in patients receiving 0.2 mg.kg-1 of vecuronium. However, these decreases in MAP were not clinically important. Changes in plasma histamine concentrations did not correlate with corresponding changes in MAP. Heart rate did not change significantly in any patient during the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In conscious animals (n = 5) the rate of glucose utilization in lumbar spinal gray matter was about 50 per cent lower than that of cerebral cortex. Halothane anaesthesia (n = 6) reduced spinal cord and cerebral metabolic rate. Spinal glucose utilization was reduced 12-35 per cent, but this was less than the 45-70 per cent decrease halothane produced in 8 of 16 cerebral structures examined and was independent of the hypotension produced. These results indicate that halothane is a spinal metabolic depressant but that its effects on this tissue are substantially less than those it has on many cerebral structures.\r"

Administration of intravenous droperidol to unpremedicated paediatric patients following induction but prior to eye manipulation markedly reduces the incidence of postoperative emesis. This study tested the hypothesis that even earlier administration of droperidol, orally as a component of an oral premedication, would further reduce the incidence of postoperative emesis in this group of patients. Sixty-five patients were randomized into three premedication groups. One group received the standard oral premedication used for all outpatients at our institution (meperidine 1.5 mg.kg-1, diazepam 0.15 mg.kg-1, atropine 0.02 mg.kg-1). In the other two groups, droperidol in a dose of 50 or 75 micrograms.kg-1 was substituted for the diazepam. Droperidol-treated groups demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of vomiting prior to hospital discharge compared to the groups that received the standard oral premedication (standard--73 per cent, 50 micrograms.kg-1 droperidol--33 per cent, 75 micrograms.kg-1 droperidol--36 per cent) without prolonging hospital stay.\r"

  ".W": "Timing and drive components of respiration were studied in 18 young children following induction of anaesthesia with ketamine and were compared with results from ten children following induction of anaesthesia with halothane. During one minute of quiet breathing, signals from a pneumotachograph attached to the anaesthetic mask were analysed for tidal volume (Vt), respiratory frequency (f), minute volume (Ve), inspiratory and expiratory times (Ti, Te) and flow pattern. Following induction of anaesthesia with ketamine, children breathed more slowly and deeply than children receiving halothane, but there was no significant difference in Ve or in Vt/Ti, suggesting that respiratory drive was similar in the two groups of children. In the children receiving ketamine, Ti was more than twice as long, and thus the ratio Ti/Te was significantly increased, in comparison with the group receiving halothane. In addition to the prolonged Ti in the children induced with ketamine, there was a more rapid increase in volume in early inspiration than in late inspiration, which is an apneustic breathing pattern. There was a slower decrease in volume in early expiration, with occasional early expiratory breath holding lasting up to three seconds, in the ketamine-induced children. The unique breathing pattern demonstrated with ketamine, consisting of large Vt, increased Ti/Te ratio, apneustic inspiratory pattern, and expiratory braking, contributed to an increased mean lung volume above functional residual capacity, of 2.40 ml.kg-1 body weight, in comparison to 1.27 ml.kg-1 in the children receiving halothane.\r"

The addition of either 50 or 100 micrograms of fentanyl resulted in longer duration of analgesia (93 +/- 9 min and 106 +/- 8 min respectively vs 55 +/- 7) and reduced bupivacaine total doses (64 +/- 0.03 and 55 +/- 1.5 respectively vs 109.5 +/- 1.3). Only the addition of 100 micrograms of fentanyl improved significantly the quality of analgesia (43.3 per cent of excellent scores vs 6.6 per cent in Group B and 5.7 per cent in Group A). Addition of fentanyl did not affect the duration of labour, the method of delivery and the neonatal neurobehaviour scores.\r"

  ".W": "Sufentanil as a supplement to halothane/N2O anaesthesia was evaluated in 32 unpremedicated infants and children age 6 months to 9 yr undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive one of four intravenous supplements: placebo, sufentanil 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms.kg-1. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR) and end-tidal halothane concentration were recorded before and after induction, supplement administration, tracheal intubation, incision and every 15 min during the procedure. Venous catecholamine samples were obtained before and after incision. A pain score was assigned to the patients in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). Sufentanil at all three doses prevented increases in SAP and HR with intubation and incision, provided superior pain relief in the PACU and did not prolong wake-up time. Sufentanil 1.0 and 1.5 micrograms.kg-1 allowed for a reduction in the halothane requirements. Sufentanil 1.5 micrograms.kg-1 was associated with lower catecholamine levels than in the placebo group following incision. Sufentanil supplementation at 1.0 and 1.5 micrograms.kg-1 was associated with bradycardia and/or hypotension during induction and an increased incidence of vomiting during the first 24 hours postoperatively. One patient in the sufentanil 1.0 micrograms.kg-1 group whose surgical time was less than 45 min exhibited respiratory depression in the PACU requiring narcotic reversal. In conclusion, sufentanil 0.5 micrograms.kg-1 improved immediate postoperative pain relief and is acceptable as a supplement during halothane anasethesia in infants and children. The associated side effects of larger doses of sufentanil (1.0 and 1.5 micrograms.kg-1) make their use as a supplement to halothane anaesthesia unacceptable.\r"

Recently, somatostatin analogue has been used successfully to treat intraoperative carcinoid crisis. In this report, we present a 66-year-old lady with carcinoid syndrome who was pre-treated with 50 micrograms somatostatin analogue IV and IM prior to surgical manipulation.

The patient presented urgently for Caesarean section, with fluid overload and worsening thrombocytopaenia. Life-threatening pulmonary oedema was manifest in the immediate preinduction period, following insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter and surgery was delayed to improve the mother's condition with intravenous diuretic therapy. Induction was carried out with the patient in the sitting position, with cricoid pressure maintained to protect the airway as the patient was lowered to a wedged, supine position. Intravenous nitroglycerin was used to control blood pressure. Low pressure mask-bag ventilation was utilized to maintain oxygen saturation and the patient was intubated and ventilated with positive end-expiratory pressure. Positive pressure ventilation was continued for 24 hours postoperatively. The perioperative course is reviewed and followed by a discussion of the anaesthetic considerations for multiple gestation pregnancies.\r"

High levels of circulating catecholamines have been postulated as one of the causes of the arrhythmias in these patients, making it advisable to select drugs and techniques known to minimize catecholamine levels. Although communication can be difficult in these profoundly deaf patients, it is important in order to reduce the emotional stress. Elective Caesarean sections under general anaesthesia have been reported; it appears that a well planned regional anaesthetic is equally safe.\r"

Immediately following reversal of the relaxant, the patient developed generalized muscle tightness and rigidity involving the trunk and extremities. This was prolonged and severe enough to interfere with adequate ventilation. The patient also had a prolonged recovery from the anaesthetic. After ruling out malignant hyperthermia and some other causes of rigidity, a tentative diagnosis of myotonia was made. The symptoms responded to IV dantrolene in a total dose of 2.0 mg.kg-1. Further testing failed to establish a definite diagnosis. Dantrolene could be a useful drug in treating such unexplained muscle rigidity.\r"

Prompt elimination of the effusion, if present, is of critical importance for the recuperation of tubotympanic drainage, because a positive therapeutic effect resulting from elimination of the effusion can only be possible in early phase of the disease, before irreversible morphological lesions have occurred.\r"

Only 2 ears maintained a significant improvement in the air-bone gap when reviewed approximately 3 months following grommet extrusion.

At this level, the efficacy and innocuity of a carbon dioxide laser treatment are related to the degree of endoscopic exposure. Thanks to the transtracheal high frequency jet ventilator, it is now possible to assure a free laryngeal endoscopic operative field. The transtracheal catheter is introduced percutaneously through the cricothyroid membrane into the trachea under endoscopic control and connected to a high frequency jet ventilator. From November 1983 to April 1985, this technique has been used in 65 cases. In 12 cases, it was the only alternative to avoid a tracheostomy. The other indications were: laryngeal papillomatosis, resection of T1a cancers of the vocal cords, fibrous strictures secondary to long term intubation, laser arytenoidectomies and benign lesions of the vocal cords. Among many advantages, the following are the most convincing: clear vision of the operative field for the surgeon, complete relaxation of the patient, good respiratory gas exchange, elimination of the risk of ignition of an endotracheal tube by laser, decreased risks of broncho-aspiration of blood and debris, and the facility to provide oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation in the postoperative period. The only complication encountered was a case of cervico-mediastinal emphysema caused by displacement of the tracheal catheter.\r"

A specific surgical procedure had been planned on 28 individual maxillary antra. In the remaining 72 antra, no such procedure was planned. As a result of the antroscopic findings, the surgical procedure was changed in 16% of the total sinuses. In 10% a more extensive, and in 6% a less extensive procedure was carried out than had been envisaged prior to antroscopy. It is concluded that intraoperative antroscopy is extremely helpful in selecting the appropriate procedure, if any, to carry out on the maxillary antrum.\r"

It is important to mention that 20 patients (95.2%) were free of tumour during a follow-up of 4-25 years (mean 11 years).

Twenty-four fractures had surgery and 29 fractures were treated nonoperatively. Criteria used in assessing outcome included range of motion, time to union, total rehabilitation time, and orthopedic and medical complications. Humeral fractures had similar outcomes with either operative or nonoperative treatment. Radial nerve injury occurring with humeral fractures prolonged the rehabilitation time. All three combined radial and ulnar fracture treated surgically developed synostosis whereas two of the three nonoperatively treated fractures had other orthopedic complications. Nondisplaced radial fractures responded appropriately to closed treatment. Displaced radial fractures treated nonoperatively had a high incidence of malunion. All ulnar fractures were treated operatively, and all achieved acceptable range of motion and fracture healing at the time of discharge. Medical complications such as deep venous thromboses and decubitus ulcers occurred more frequently in the nonoperatively treated group (28%) than in the operatively treated group (4%). Standard guidelines for upper extremity fracture care apply to the patient with a spinal cord injury. However, operative stabilization may be associated with a decreased risk of medical complications in these patients.\r"

The likelihood of muscle overuse being the cause of this late functional loss was investigated by dynamic electromyography (EMG) and foot-switch stride analysis in 34 symptomatic patients. Manual testing grouped the muscles, with strong (S) encompassing Grades Good (G) and Normal (N) while weak (W) included Fair plus (F+) to zero (0). After testing quadriceps and calf strength, the patients fell into one of four classes: strong quadriceps and calf (SQ/SC), strong quadriceps and weak calf (SQ/WC), weak quadriceps and strong calf (WQ/SC), or combined weak quadriceps and calf (WQ/WC). Quantified EMG (normalized by the manual muscle test EMG) defined the mean duration and intensity of the quadriceps, soleus, lower gluteus maximus, and long head of the biceps femoris during walking. Overuse was defined as values greater than the laboratory normal (mean + 1 SD). Each muscle exhibited instances of overuse, normalcy, and sparing. The biceps femoris was the only muscle with dominant overuse (82%). Quadriceps overuse was next in frequency (53%). Soleus activity infrequently exceeded normal function (34%), but this still represented more than twice the intensity and duration of the other muscles. Gluteus maximus action was also seldom excessive (34%). The patients averaged two muscles with excessive use during walking. Gait velocity of the SQ/SC strong group was highest (71% of normal) while the three categories that included weak muscles had walking speeds in the range of 50% of normal. The finding of muscle overuse during a single free-speed walking test that does not attain normal velocity supports the concept of muscle overuse being the cause of the patient's dysfunction.\r"

Surgical stabilization, combined in eight cases with cord decompression, successfully relieved pain and prevented further neurologic deterioration in 17 of 18 patients with radioresistant tumors. Complications included two patients who were treated with short posterior fusions displacing as a result of tumors progressing above and below the fusion, and one patient in whom an anterior methacrylate mass became dislodged and appeared to jeopardize the esophagus. Methacrylate was used to augment the grafts posteriorly to facilitate early mobilization without the need for a halo splint. Mean patient survival was not significantly increased by surgical intervention (26 weeks vs. 20 weeks). While most lesions of the cervical spine can best be managed by nonoperative methods, in selected patients long posterior fusion with wires and methacrylate appears successful in relieving pain, halting progress of neurologic deficits, and facilitating early mobilization.\r"

The follow-up period averaged 32 months (range, 12-50 months). Treatment was as follows: nonoperative (three patients), Harrington rods and fusion (seven patients), and Harrington rods and fusion followed by anterior decompression and fusion (four patients). The initial severity of paralysis did not correlate with the initial fracture roentgenographic pattern or the amount of initial CT canal compromise. Neurologic recovery did not correlate with the treatment method or amount of canal decompression. Subsequent recovery did correlate with the initial fracture pattern. If the patient had a Type I or Type II fracture (both greater than 15 degrees kyphosis), greater than 90% neurologic recovery occurred, regardless of treatment. If the patient had a Type III fracture (less than 15 degrees kyphosis and the maximal canal compromise where bone encircles the canal) less than 50% neurologic recovery occurred. If the patient had a Type IV fracture (less than or equal to 15 degrees kyphosis and the maximal canal compromise at the level of the ligamentum flavum), the neurologic recovery was variable. Prognosis for neurologic recovery can be made based on initial roentgenograms. If greater than 15 degrees kyphosis is present, there is a good prognosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During a ten-year period, 77 patients with spinal instability caused by metastatic pathologic fractures of one or more vertebrae were treated with anterior decompression and stabilization by replacement of the affected vertebral bodies with methylmethacrylate, polymerizing in situ, augmented by Knodt distraction rods positioned anteriorly. No postoperative external support was required, and the fixation achieved by this method was not affected adversely by subsequent irradiation at a mean of 4020 rads. Sixty-two patients had major neurologic impairments preoperatively and required spinal cord and/or nerve root decompression anteriorly prior to fixation. Of these, 26 had complete neurologic recovery postoperatively, 16 others improved significantly, 20 remained unchanged, and one patient deteriorated neurologically. Five patients suffered failures of fixation, although two were successfully restabilized after a second operation. The remaining 72 patients enjoyed good or excellent resolution of spine pain postoperatively, and, in patients surviving their underlying malignancies, stability did not deteriorate during the follow-up period ranging from 42 to 146 months. Six patients developed spinal instability from tumor lysis at a different level between five and 95 months postoperatively. All were treated with successful decompression and stabilization. There was one wound infection among the 83 anterior stabilization procedures. However, three of the six patients requiring secondary posterior stabilization suffered wound dehiscences, and three of these became infected.\r"

Ninety-six persons with chronic low back pain were evaluated with a battery of physical and psychologic disability measures and basic physical fitness tests for aerobic capacity, strength, and flexibility. Greater overall physical fitness was significantly correlated with less physical dysfunction (R = -0.48) and fewer depressive symptoms (multiple R = -0.42), but not with psychologic dysfunction (R = -0.20) or pain (R = -0.20). Fitness accounted for 23% of the variance in physical dysfunction and 17% of the variance in depression in this mildly dysfunctional chronic back pain patient sample. Strength, as compared with aerobic capacity or flexibility, was the fitness variable contributing most to these observed associations.\r"

A complete release of the common extensor tendon permitted about a 1-cm distal muscle slide to a new resting length. The results indicate 73% excellent, 18% good, and 9% failures. Complete pain relief was obtained in 25 of 34 (73%) elbows, and eight of 33 (24%) had minimal residual symptoms that did not impair activity. There was no loss of range of motion in any patient, and 33 of 34 (97%) elbows had improved extremity muscle strength. All but one patient (97%) returned to their regular jobs on the average of five weeks after surgery. The gross and histologic findings were consistent with a degenerative process. This relatively simple outpatient procedure using Bier block anesthesia is recommended for carefully selected patients.\r"

To evaluate and define this test, 13 patients with clinical and electrophysiologic evidence of cubital tunnel syndrome were tested with elbow flexion in a standardized manner. This consisted of full elbow flexion with full extension of the wrists for three minutes. All patients noted the onset of or the increase in one or more of the symptoms of pain, numbness, or tingling with this test. Numbness and tingling followed the sensory distribution of the ulnar nerve, but pain was not limited to the ulnar nerve distribution. The symptom complex, rapid onset, and rapid resolution of symptoms support a locally induced segmental ulnar nerve ischemia as the cause of symptoms. This study demonstrates the elbow flexion test to be a useful, reliable, and provocative test for the cubital tunnel syndrome.\r"

Compression of the median nerve (8%) was twice as common as ulnar nerve compression (4%). Eighty-five percent of the patients with median nerve compression had malunion with radial collapse with or without other deformities (dorsal angulation/radial displacement). Patients with ulnar nerve compression had either malunion with radial collapse or volar subluxation of the ulnar head in those fractures that healed with dorsal angulation. Patients without nerve complications showed a significantly lower rate of malunions. These results demonstrate that anatomic derangements play a role in the development of late compression neuropathies following Colles' fractures.\r"

An accurate physical examination and awareness of the syndrome are essential for diagnosis. Compartmental pressures can be obtained easily and afford a rapid means of corroboration. Once the diagnosis is established, adequate decompression of all involved compartments, including carpal tunnel release, is essential. The literature is unclear regarding the etiology of this complication. There is nothing structurally intrinsic to the distal radius that should lead to a compartmental syndrome. Both the amount of soft tissue damage at the time of fracture and the mode of immobilization (excessive elevation, constricting splint, etc.) are the ultimate determinants of a successful (or unsuccessful) outcome.\r"

The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was measured 16 hours after the addition of factors. After three to five days treatment, Triton X-100 extracts of the cells were assayed for acid phosphatase activity, in the presence and absence of tartrate, and for alkaline phosphatase activity. Fluoride stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation and specific activity of alkaline phosphatase in human bone cells and chick bone cells but not in human skin cells. Fluoride also stimulated the cell population doubling rate of the human bone cells with an optimum of approximately 20 mumol/L. Bovine bone extract stimulated thymidine uptake into DNA several-fold and decreased alkaline phosphatase activity in all three types of cultured cells. The specific activity of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was increased in bone cells but not in skin fibroblasts. These results suggest that fluoride specifically stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, while the growth factors in bovine bone extract primarily stimulate proliferation of bone cells. Cultures of human bone cells respond similarly to chick calvarial cells when treated with fluoride or bovine bone extract.\r"

  ".W": "Although it has been demonstrated in experimental animals that vascular perfusion functions less effectively than diffusion as a nutrient pathway to the uninjured flexor tendon, it is recognized that the nutritional requirements of an injured flexor tendon may be different. The present study examines several biochemical parameters of avian flexor tendon repair, during a six-week period, in the presence of an intact vinculum longum and with the vinculum longum ligated. Formation of collagen/noncollagen protein, glycosaminoglycan synthesis, and tissue levels of both DNA and hexosamine were quantified. The absence of the vincular blood supply did not affect the levels of total DNA and hexosamine, did not alter the pattern of either protein or glycosaminoglycan formation in the early healing phase, and did not impair the overall synthesis of collagen and noncollagen protein throughout the six-week study period. However, the pattern of collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis differed in lacerated tendons during the period of repair; noncollagen protein synthesis peaked at ten days, while collagen synthesis increased uniformly throughout the 42-day period of study. There was a notable decrease in total matrix hydroxyproline (collagen) during repair, which continued throughout the entire first three weeks after laceration. Thus, the actual percentage of collagen synthesis decreased during the first three weeks of repair and began to return to its normal uninjured level by the sixth week.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean duration of diarrhea was shortest in the rotavirus and \"no pathogen\" groups (4.8 and 5.6 days, respectively) and longest with pure and mixed salmonella infections (12.3 and 12.9 days, respectively). Associated manifestations were most frequent with salmonellae and least frequent with rotavirus and E. coli infections. Malnutrition also was most common with salmonellae and lowest with rotavirus and E. coli. There were no differences in the frequency of hypernatremia. Hyponatremia was most frequently encountered with salmonella (25% compared to 9% in the rest of the patients). Evidence of septicemia was found in 22 patients, 21 of whom were in the salmonella groups. The four deaths in this series (0.7%) also were in the salmonellae groups. The clinical severity of salmonella infection in developing countries, particularly in young and malnourished children, warrants attention to more intensive management. The selective use of antibiotics may help reduce the mortality and morbidity of gastroenteritis.\r"

Total LDH and LDH-5 activities were higher in the female (33.2 +/- 5.2 and 12.4 +/- 2.8 mU/mL, respectively), than in the male population (9.7 +/- 2.2 and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mU/mL, respectively). The amount of LDH correlated with the presence of epithelial cells in the urine that also were prominent in female patients and were apparently derived from the vagina. Separation of epithelial cells by centrifugation and filtration decreased total LDH and isoenzyme activities in the remaining sample, while sonification of the resuspended cells increased TLDH and LDH-5 activities by 6- and 12-fold respectively. Saline washings of the perineum and vagina revealed large numbers of epithelial cells and similar LDH isoenzyme patterns suggesting that contamination of the urine with these cells is a frequent occurrence during collection of voided and/or bag urine samples, and that these cells are responsible for much of the LDH activity found in the urine. We conclude that epithelial cells can increase both total LDH and isoenzyme activity in voided urine samples from otherwise normal female neonates. In this age group, urine collected by other methods (catheterization or suprapubic aspiration) must be studied to minimize the possibility of contamination of the sample with epithelial cells from the vagina or the perineum or both.\r"

At both temperatures, the relationships between PtcO2 and PaO2 were linear over the whole range of data (PaO2 39.75 to 120 torr) although mean PtcO2/PaO2 fell from 44 degrees to 43 degrees C. Skin stripping by repeated applications of adhesive tape immediately before electrode placement did not improve these relationships. In an additional 20 children with a mean age of 2.4 yr (range 0.08 to 15.85) who were being investigated for sleep-disordered breathing, the mean PaO2/PtcO2 ratio of 1.22 at 44 degrees C was used as a correction factor during air calibration for PtcO2. This resulted in a mean PtcO2/PaO2 of 0.99 (range 0.83 to 1.15) provided blood flow is not impaired. Extending the monitoring period from 4 to 8 h between site changes did not result in any burns or persisting erythema. In hemodynamically stable infants and children, and at electrode temperatures of 44 degrees C and 43 degrees C, PtcO2 is linearly related to PaO2 over a wide range of PaO2 values. At an electrode temperature of 44 degrees C, PtcO2 can be arterialized effectively by allowing for transepidermal O2 loss during air calibration; at this electrode temperature, intervals between site changes can be extended safely up to 8 h.\r"

One group represented an untreated time control (n = 6) while the second group (n = 6) was pretreated with 25 mg/kg of iv ibuprofen. Repeat measurements were taken at 30, 60 and 90 min after glass bead embolism. Compared to the untreated group, the pretreated group had only a slightly decreased PaO2 (pretreated, 82% of baseline vs. untreated, 35% of baseline, p less than .05). The initial elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was similar in both groups but in the pretreated group it had returned nearly to baseline values by the end of the study in contrast to the persistent elevation of the PVR observed in the untreated group. We conclude that pretreatment with ibuprofen resulted in improved arterial oxygenation and a reduction in PVR over the time period studied. This implicates a role for arachidonic acid metabolites in the pathophysiology of this injury.\r"

Nineteen animals were bled to shock and the shed blood was retransfused in the control group. Liver oxygenation was measured directly by means of a silicone tube used as a tonometer, and indirectly by calculating liver O2 consumption (VO2). PscO2 was monitored with a needle electrode. The two colloid groups were compared by measuring plasma lactate, and the plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COPp). PscO2 followed closely the changes in liver tissue PO2 during the experiment; it seems to be a useful tool in estimating volume filling during the treatment of hemorrhagic shock. A wider variation was noted in calculated liver VO2 compared with hepatic venous PO2 or liver tissue PO2. Despite the fact that COPp increased to a higher level after the administration of dextran, HES proved to be at least as effective as dextran in restoring mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, liver oxygenation, PscO2, arterial pH, arterial plasma lactate, and liver lactate uptake.\r"

We thus evaluated the effects of lactated Ringer's (LR) and 6% hetastarch (HES) solutions on brain edema, intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in anesthetized rabbits, using a model of isovolemic hemodilution (IVHD). In this model, arterial blood was removed at a rate of approximately 2 ml/min for one hour and replaced simultaneously with LR or HES in amounts needed to maintain arterial BP and CVP; Hct decreased from approximately 40% to approximately 19%. Thirty-six animals were divided into three groups (n = 12 each): a) IVHD with LR, b) IVHD with HES, and c) maintenance LR without hemodilution. To permit the examination of both acute and delayed fluid effects, each group was further divided into two subgroups (n = 6 each): one in which animals were sacrificed immediately on completion of the one-hour IVHD period (early), and one in which animals were sacrificed 4 h later (late). After sacrifice, brain and skeletal muscle water contents (% H2O) were determined, and the specific gravity (SpGr) of multiple brain samples was measured. Much larger volumes of LR were required to maintain normovolemia as compared with HES, (e.g., totals 203 +/- 68 vs. 76 +/- 18 ml/kg, respectively in late animals) and those given LR had larger increases in body weight and muscle % H2O.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Closed-system PEL and PLL are equally efficient at rewarming hypothermic dogs and do so at a rate approximating 6 degrees C/h/m2. Cardiovascular responses to PEL and PLL were similar. Serum electrolytes, protein, Hct, and arterial blood gases were comparable and little changed when compared in prehypothermia and postrewarming periods. HAI alone provides little heat for rewarming; more heat is realized from endogenous metabolism. Nevertheless, HAI's ease of use and possible selective cardiac rewarming characteristics argue for its inclusion with other methods of active rewarming. The use of PEL or PLL is governed by clinical circumstances.\r"

Agreement between the two techniques was satisfactory with the mean difference being 0.4 mm Hg. FP rose on each of the first 5 days after birth. CPP also rose over the 5 days but there were periods during suctioning of the endotracheal tube, crying, and vigorous activity when CPP was very low.\r"

  ".W": "Flexible fiberoptic endoscopy (FFE) was utilized in a series of 24 critically ill pediatric patients to determine the position of the endotracheal tube (ETT) tip relative to the carina. Training on a model system revealed no significant differences in predicting ETT-to-carina distance (ETT-C) with respect to operator, ETT size, or absolute ETT-C as measured directly. No significant differences in ETT-C could be determined between traditional bedside chest x-ray (CXR) or FFE when FFE was performed on intubated pediatric ICU patients. A correlation coefficient comparing the two methods was 0.767. Neither ETT size nor FFE operator affected this correlation. Although used as the gold standard, CXR failed to demonstrate the carina clearly in 15 patients. FFE delineated the carina clearly in 22 patients. Ability to visualize ETT placement within the trachea was essentially identical for FFE (22/24) compared to CXR (23/24). However, the time required to obtain this information was significantly different: 30.6 min (range 13 to 57) for CXR; 40 sec (range 16 to 94) for FFE. No clinically significant changes in patient pulse oximetry, heart rate, or physical exam were observed during FFE. Only copious secretions impaired the utility of FFE. We concluded that FFE is a safe, fast, easily learned method to determine relative ETT position or precise ETT-C in the mechanically ventilated pediatric patient.\r"

  ".W": "During continuous drug administration to pediatric patients, unfavorable pharmacologic effects have occurred. These effects were attributed to variations in flow from electronic infusion devices (EIDs). The intent of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of microrate (0.1 to 99.9 ml/h) EID on the accuracy, continuity, and pattern of flow of continuously effused fluid. Using a factorial study design, iv fluid was effused through iv delivery systems using combinations of five microrate EIDs, three iv flow rates, and three sample-collection intervals. Serial weights were measured at the appropriate sample-collection time using a computerized gravimetric technique to determine accuracy, continuity, and pattern of flow. All the EIDs produced accurate flow within 5% of the desired rate of 5 and 10 ml/h. At 1 ml/h, the actual iv flow rate ranged from 65.1% to 91% of the desired rate. Each of the respective EIDs produced various levels of flow continuity; each flow pattern characterized the mechanism of pump operation for each device. Thus, alteration in response (e.g., increased toxicity or decreased efficacy) to a continuous drug infusion must not be attributed exclusively to the drug or clinical condition of the patient. Serious consideration should also be given to the method of drug delivery and, in particular, the continuity of flow that results from a particular EID.\r"

Eighty four patients treated from 1960 to April 1986, representing 20.4 percent (84 of 412) of the surgically treated diverticular disease patients, were reviewed. Eight patients had multiple fistulas. Sixty-five percent (60 to 92) of fistulas were colovesical, 25 percent (23 of 92) colovaginal, 6.5 percent (6 of 92) coloenteric, and 3 percent (3 of 92) colouterine fistulas. There were 66 percent (35 of 53) males and 34 percent (18 of 53) females with colovesical fistulas only. Hysterectomies had been performed in 50 percent (12 of 24) and 83 percent (19 of 23) of females with colovesical and colovaginal fistulas, respectively. Operative management included: resection anastomosis, resection with anastomosis and diversion, Hartmann procedure, and three-stage procedure. In the latter half of the series there was a significant decrease in staging procedures with no significant statistical difference in complications. There were three deaths (3.5 percent) in the series. Other complications included: wound infection, 21 percent (18 of 84), enterocutaneous fistula, 1 percent (4 of 84), and anastomotic dehiscence, 5 percent (4 of 84). Primary anastomosis can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality and today is the procedure of choice, leaving staging procedures to selected patients.\r"

The hospital mortality was 42.2% in diabetic and 24.7% in nondiabetic patients, an odds ratio of 2.22 (CI 1.37-3.60, P less than .002). The excess mortality was due to cardiogenic shock and left ventricular failure (pump failure). There was no difference in peak levels of aspartate transaminase between the groups. Among the diabetic patients, the admission levels of plasma glucose and peak levels of aspartate transaminase were higher among those who developed pump failure or died, but there was no relationship between outcome and gender, disease duration, or treatment. Prior blood glucose control, as judged by levels of HbA1c, was not related to hospital outcome (P greater than .5). In a further study, the 83 diabetic patients were compared with 249 age- and sex-matched diabetic subjects without myocardial infarction for treatment, disease duration, and control. There was an increased risk of admission with myocardial infarction of 2.35 (CI 1.41-3.92, P less than .005) within the first 5 yr of diagnosis of diabetes. Infarct patients had significantly lower levels of HbA1c than control subjects (P less than .005), but treatment did not differ between groups. Neither incidence nor case fatality of myocardial infarction in diabetic patients is positively associated with cumulative glycemic exposure.\r"

A total of 510 diabetic and 649 nondiabetic subjects aged 45-64 yr were examined in East Finland and 549 diabetic and 724 nondiabetic subjects of the same age in West Finland. In both areas and in both sexes the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and intermittent claudication was higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic subjects. Both in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects the prevalence of ASVD was higher in East Finland than in West Finland. In men, the East-West difference in the prevalence of symptomatic CHD and claudication was greater in diabetic than in nondiabetic subjects. In both areas and in both sexes the serum lipid pattern was more atherogenic and hypertension was more frequent in diabetic than in nondiabetic subjects. In both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, serum total-cholesterol level was somewhat higher and hypertension was more frequent in East Finland than in West Finland. The East-West difference in serum total-cholesterol was greater in diabetic than in nondiabetic subjects. In multiple logistic analyses including cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes status, and area of residence, residence in East Finland was found to be, in addition to diabetes, a strong independent factor associated with CHD, particularly in men.\r"

LEAOD was monitored with the ankle/arm systolic blood pressure index in combination with Doppler arterial velocity waveform analysis. LEAOD was much more prevalent in the type II patients (22%, 55 of 252) than in the control subjects (3%, 4 of 158) (P less than .00001). The prevalence of risk factors for LEAOD was much higher in the type II patients, including elevated triglyceride, depressed high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hypertension, smoking, and elevated systolic blood pressure. In type II diabetic patients the incidence of new LEAOD over a 2-yr period (14%, 28 of 197) was lower than the incidence of LEAOD progression (87%, 45 of 52). Type II patients with LEAOD also had a high incidence of mortality (22%, 12 of 55) compared with those without LEAOD (4%, 8 of 197) (P less than .0005). A risk score including smoking history, duration of diabetes, depressed HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, elevated systolic blood pressure, and low obesity index is related to LEAOD. After accounting for the effect of all of the risk factors, we suggest that type II diabetes contributes additional risk for LEAOD.\r"

  ".W": "Clarification of the extent and mechanisms of damage to the central nervous system in diabetes is a frontier of current neurological research. Our aim was to obtain ample electrophysiological documentation of possible neurological abnormalities in both insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetic patients with a short duration of disease and without overt complications, taking into account metabolic control. Group 1 comprised 11 IDDM patients, and group 2 included 14 NIDDM patients treated with diet alone; the duration of disease was less than 4 yr, and no concomitant clinical complications were present. Age- and sex-matched normal subjects formed groups 3 and 4. Pattern visual evoked potentials (VEP), brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP; after the stimulation of both median and tibial nerves) were recorded in all subjects, and metabolic control was evaluated in terms of glycemia and glycosylated hemoglobin. In group 1, significant abnormalities were found in the latency values of VEP, median SEP, and tibial SEP compared with control subjects. Similar latency abnormalities were shown in group 2 for VEP, median SEP, and tibial SEP values and for wave I latency of BAEP. Glycosylated hemoglobin values were correlated with BAEP and SEP abnormalities in many patients in both groups. Furthermore, in group 2, glycemic values correlated with SEP abnormalities. We therefore conclude that neurophysiological abnormalities are present at different levels in IDDM and NIDDM patients only a few years after clinical diagnosis and before the appearance of overt complications, and these abnormalities seem to be correlated with metabolic control status.\r"

Diabetic patients tended to have less warm and cool sensitivity than the control subjects (P less than .001 for age less than 50 yr and P less than .05 for age greater than or equal to 50 yr). Both patients asymptomatic for neuropathy and patients with symptoms had impairment of warm and cool sensitivity (P less than .05 for comparisons with control subjects). These differences persisted (P less than .05) in covariance analyses with age included as a covariate. There was a nonlinear association between warm sensitivity and hemoglobin A1c. Warm-sensitivity values in the lowest and middle tertiles of the hemoglobin A1c distribution were similar; however, warm-sensitivity values of patients in the highest tertile were markedly increased (P less than .05 for the comparison of the highest tertile with the lowest and middle tertiles combined). There tended to be more warm insensitivity than cool insensitivity among the diabetic patients, and this difference increased with worsening glycemia. These data indicate that both warm and cool sensations are markedly impaired in asymptomatic adult diabetic patients. They also suggest that warm sensitivity is more impaired than cool sensitivity, and that this is the result of a stronger association between warm sensitivity and metabolic factors.\r"

Administration of GH increases circulating insulin-like growth factor I levels (IGF-I) and restores, in part, the responsiveness of serum 1,25-(OH)2D to restriction of dietary phosphorus. To determine whether the GH-dependent increase in serum 1,25-(OH)2D induced by restriction of dietary phosphorus is mediated by IGF-I, we measured the serum concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D in hypophysectomized rats treated with either GH (100 micrograms/day) or recombinant human IGF-I (150 micrograms/day) and fed either a normal or low phosphorus diet for 6 days. Restriction of dietary phosphorus in sham-hypophysectomized rats increased serum 1,25-(OH)2D from 97 +/- 13 to 251 +/- 36 pg/ml, or 159%, but had no effect on serum 1,25-(OH)2D in hypophysectomized rats. Restriction of dietary phosphorus in rats receiving GH increased, (P less than 0.001) serum 1,25-(OH)2D from 52 +/- 8 to 133 +/- 18 pg/ml, or 156%. Restriction of dietary phosphorus in rats receiving IGF-I increased (P less than 0.001) serum 1,25-(OH)2D from 33 +/- 5 to 94 +/- 11 pg/ml, or 185%, an increase equivalent to that observed in animals receiving GH. For a given diet, no significant differences were seen between the serum concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D in animals receiving GH or IGF-I. These data indicate that IGF-I can restore the increase in serum 1,25-(OH)2D induced by restriction of dietary phosphorus to the same degree as GH. This strongly suggests that the GH-dependent increase in serum 1,25-(OH)2D induced by restriction of dietary phosphorus is mediated by IGF-I.\r"

Scatchard analysis revealed that the equilibrium association constant was significantly reduced [5 mM ATP, 0.3 +/- 0.1 (+/- SE) 10(10) M-1; control, 1.1 +/- 0.15 X 10(10) M-1], but the maximum binding capacity remained unchanged. Similar values of inhibition were obtained when unbound receptors were preincubated with ATP. ATP achieved its maximal effect after 45 min of incubation at 30 C. Dilution experiments indicated that the effect of ATP was reversible. The inhibiting potency of nucleoside triphosphates at pH 8.0 was in the following order: ATP = CTP greater than GTP, whereas UTP had no effect. Nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP were also inhibitory, and HPLC fractionation showed an approximately 98% recovery of ATP after incubation with nuclear extract. The adenine ring with at least two phosphates was essential, since ADP was as potent as ATP, whereas AMP had no effect. When the pH of the incubation medium was lowered to 7.3, the T3-binding activity was inhibited by ATP in the 0.1-1 mM range. Magnesium (3 mM) greatly increases the ATP effect at pH 7.3, but not at pH 8. The T3-binding activity was also drastically reduced when calf intestine alkaline phosphatase was added concomitantly in the incubation medium. Eight micrograms per ml enzyme were necessary to inhibit the T3 specific binding by 50% (30 C for 45 min). Scatchard analysis showed that the receptor affinity for T3 was decreased (control, 1.1 +/- 0.02 x 10(10) M-1; alkaline phosphatase, 0.41 +/- 0.03 x 10(10) M-1; n = 6), whereas the maximum binding capacity remained unchanged. Incubations performed with increasing concentrations of beta-mercaphoethanol (2.5, 5, 10, and 25 mM) revealed that the phosphatase inhibitory effect is thiol dependent. The inhibition was maximal at 2.5 mM and progressively decreased at 5 and 10 mM. No inhibition occurred at 25 mM. When a saturating concentration of T3 was employed, the specific binding was decreased at low thiol concentrations. These observations show that the nuclear T3 receptors may be modulated by ATP/ADP and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes. It is proposed that in vitro dephosphorylation leads to rapid oxydation of sulfhydryl groups which are essential for optimum T3 binding.\r"

Epithelial cells from the immature mouse uterus were successfully cultivated in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and Ham's F-12 supplemented with insulin (5 micrograms/ml), transferrin (10 micrograms/ml), hydrocortisone (10(-7) M), BSA (2 mg/ml), and fetuin (1 mg/ml). Addition of 17 beta-estradiol in the range of 1-100 nM did not significantly change the total DNA content of the epithelial cells. A binding component of [3H]estradiol by cultured uterine cells was shown to be specific, saturable, and of high affinity. Kd values for specific binding by epithelial and stromal cells were 1.0-1.7 x 10(-10) M. Maximal specific binding was 0.74 and 2.3 fmol/micrograms DNA for epithelial and stromal cells, respectively. Treatment of epithelial and stromal cells for 4 days with 10 nM estradiol led to a 2- to 6-fold increase in progesterone receptor concentration. Treatment of epithelial and stromal cells in mixed culture for 4 days with 10 nM estradiol resulted in a significant increase in total DNA. That epithelial-stromal contact was critical for estradiol stimulation was shown by the fact that if the cell types were separated into two compartments which still allowed free media mixing, total DNA was not enhanced by estradiol. These observations are organized into a model for mitogenic action of estradiol that seems to reconcile observed disparities in the action of the hormone in vivo and in vitro.\r"

They appear to act as agents that prevent regression of the corpus luteum during early pregnancy in the ewe and cow. Ovine TP-1 [mol wt (Mr), 17,000] consists of three or four isoelectric variants (pI 5.4-5.7), whereas bTP-1, which cross-reacts with antiserum to oTP-1, is found as two predominant Mr classes (Mr, 22,000 and 24,000), each with several isoelectric variants (in the pI range 6.3-6.8). Cell-free translation of ovine conceptus mRNA yields pre-oTP-1 also consists of three or four isoelectric variants, assumed to have arisen by translation of multiple mRNA species. Ovine TP-1 is not glycosylated. When bovine conceptus mRNA is translated, a group of four or five isoforms of pre-bTP-1 are generated, each with a Mr of 19,000. In the presence of microsomes the Mr shifts upward to about 21,500. Bovine conceptuses cultured in presence of either [3H]glucosamine or [3H]mannose incorporate label into both size classes of bTP-1 (Mr, 22,000 and 24,000). Culture in presence of [35S]methionine and tunicamycin gave rise to a nonglycosylated form of bTP-1 with an apparent Mr of 18,000. Treatment of [35S]methionine-labeled bTP-1 with either endoglycosidase-H or peptide:N-glycosidase F yielded products with Mr of 17,000 and 16,000, respectively. bTP-1, although functionally and structurally related to oTP-1, appears to be a glycoprotein carrying at least two Asn-linked oligosaccharides. The two Mr classes of bTP-1 arise as a result of differences in either the number or structure of the carbohydrate chains. Like oTP-1, bTP-1 is probably translated from multiple mRNA species.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid glucose metabolism can provide NADPH and H2O2 for thyroid hormone synthesis. Several agents stimulate glucose oxidation in thyroid slices, but little is known about glucose transport in this tissue. In the present study, various thyroid stimulators were tested on glucose transport and oxidation using primary cultures of dog thyroid cells. After preincubating the cells with the agonists, glucose uptake was measured by adding 2-deoxy-D-[1-3H]glucose [( 3H]2-DOG) for 5 min, and glucose oxidation was assessed during a single 60-min incubation with agonist and D-[1-14C]glucose. TSH (0.1-10 mU/ml), 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 10(-8)-10(-6) M), and carbachol 10(-6)-10(-2) M) stimulated [3H]2-DOG transport and glucose oxidation in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of TSH appears to be mediated by cAMP, since N6,2'-O-dibutyryl cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, cholera toxin, and isobutylmethylxanthine also stimulated [3H]2-DOG transport. Norepinephrine, which had no effect by itself on either transport or oxidation, inhibited TSH stimulation of [3H]2-DOG transport via an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor. The mechanism of the TPA and carbachol effect does not involve cAMP. A combination of maximal amounts of TSH or bromo-cAMP and carbachol or TPA produced additive effects on transport, while addition of TPA with carbachol produced no such additive effect. Kinetic analysis of 2-DOG transport indicated that all three agonists reduced the Km and increased the maximum velocity. Basal 2-DOG transport was increased in Ca2+-free medium, with or without EGTA, or in the presence of calcium channel blockers such as La3+ or Mn2+. In the presence of such increased basal glucose transport, TSH further stimulated it when Mn2+ was used, had no effect in Ca2+-free buffer plus EGTA, and caused an inhibition with La3+. Such inhibition was not caused when N6,2'-O-dibutyryl cAMP was used in the presence of La3+. Carbachol and TPA did not stimulate transport when the Ca2+ channel blockers were used, but a small increase was seen in Ca2+-free buffer containing EGTA. TSH stimulation of cAMP production was also diminished in the presence of La3+, but enhanced in the presence of Mn2+. The calmodulin inhibitor W-7 and the intracellular Ca2+ blocker 8-N,N-diethylamino octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride diminished the stimulation of [3H]2-DOG transport and glucose oxidation induced by TSH, carbachol, and TPA. These data indicate that thyroid glucose transport and glucose oxidation are regulated by both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent systems.\r"

In competitive binding studies using lactogen receptors from mammary glands of lactating rabbits, glycosylated oPRL had only 20% the potency of oPRL. In the Nb2 assay also, glycosylated oPRL was approximately 24% as potent as oPRL in stimulating mitogenic activity. Thus, these studies show that the glycosylated variant of PRL has less biological activity than the major PRL form and that the alteration of an activity by glycosylation is selective.\r"

  ".U": "88296310\r", 
  ".W": "Previous observations in our laboratory indicated that rat serum samples being bioassayed for PRL with the use of Nb2 lymphoma cells produced mitogenic responses greater than maximally effective doses of purified rat PRL. The present studies were conducted to confirm these observations and to determine the possible serum factor or factors responsible for the potentiated response of serum. Twenty five rat serum pools prepared from blood samples obtained from lactating, ovariectomized, and steroid-treated rats were assayed in duplicate aliquots of 0.3-50 microliter against NIDDK-RP-1 rat PRL (11 IU/mg) by the Nb2 bioassay in Fischer's Medium containing 10% horse serum and by conventional double antibody RIA. The mitogenic response of 18 of the 25 pools were clearly greater than the response to standard rat PRL when included in the bioassay at 10-50 microliter/ml of cells. When less than 10 microliter serum pools were assayed, parallelism to the standard was observed; but the concentrations of PRL determined by bioassay were 82 +/- (SE) 4% of the levels determined by RIA in samples from ovariectomized, steroid-treated rats stored for two or four weeks and 62 +/- 2% in samples from lactating rats stored for 3-6 months. Horse serum and hypophysectomized rat serum also potentiated the mitogenic responses to 1 or 5 ng standard rat PRL when added at 10-150 microliter/ml of culture medium that already contained 100 microliter (10%) horse serum. No potentiation of the RIA was observed with rat or horse serum. Insulin, proinsulin, or C peptide of proinsulin (0.02 ng-2 micrograms/ml); fibroblast growth factor, nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factors I or II (0.002-200 ng/ml), T cell growth factor (TCGF) (0.0002-20 half-maximal units/ml) or platelet-derived growth factor (0.002-10 half-maximal units) did not potentiate the responses to 1 or 5 ng/ml standard rat PRL. Of the growth factors tested, only TCGF was mitogenic to Nb2 cells when placed alone in the medium, but this mitogenic effect of TCGF was not potentiated by horse serum. We conclude that serum can potentiate the mitogenic effect of PRL on Nb2 cells grown in Fischer's medium.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin are polypeptide hormones that stimulate their cellular responses by binding to specific cell membrane receptors. These receptors, while chemically distinct, have similar structural and functional characteristics. This manuscript describes the production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody that binds to both type I IGF and insulin receptors. This antibody did not inhibit hormone binding to either receptor type, but stimulated DNA synthesis in both human and murine fibroblasts. Ten BALB/c-BYJ mice were immunized with human placental membrane fragments, and their splenic lymphocytes were fused with SP2 AG0 mouse myeloma cells. Of approximately 3000 hybridoma clones thus obtained, 1 viable clone, designated V3,8 D7, was found to produce an antibody directed against the type I IGF receptor. Solubilized radiolabeled placental membranes immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified antibody and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed bands with relative molecular masses corresponding to the nonreduced intact receptor (approximately 350 x 10(3], the alpha-subunit (130-140 x 10(3], and the beta-subunit (90 x 10(3] of the type I IGF receptor. Clonal supernatant and affinity-purified antibody precipitated solubilized receptors affinity labeled with [125I]IGF-I. Antibody V3,8 D7 also precipitated solubilized placental membranes affinity labeled with [125I]insulin. However, solubilized receptors affinity purified by the monoclonal antibody bound IGF-I much better than insulin, suggesting that this antibody has a higher affinity for the type I IGF receptor than for the insulin receptor. Affinity-purified antibody did not inhibit the binding of IGF-I or insulin to receptors on human placental membranes, suggesting that it is directed against a site on the type I IGF and insulin receptor not involved in hormone binding. However, affinity-purified monoclonal antibody stimulated DNA synthesis in human GM 498 and murine BALB/c-3T3 clone A 31 fibroblasts, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. The combination of IGF-I and affinity-purified antibody did not increase thymidine incorporation above levels observed with either substrate alone, suggesting that these factors may be operating through a common mechanism. These results suggest that antibody V3,8 D7 can stimulate receptor responses by binding to a site on the type I IGF and/or insulin receptors that is not involved in hormone binding. These data support the concept that hormone receptors themselves possess the biological information required for stimulating specific cellular responses.\r"

  ".U": "88296316\r", 
  ".W": "This paper is concerned with the identification and isolation in cross-linked form of a protein of bovine adrenal cortical particulates that binds the ACTH probe 125I-[Phe2,Nle4,DTBct25]ACTH-(1-25) amide specifically, reversibly, and with high affinity. This protein may well represent the long sought, adenylate cyclase-linked, low affinity ACTH receptor or a portion thereof. Evaluation of the binding data by Scatchard analysis afforded a linear plot corresponding to a dissociation constant of 2.7 X 10(-9) M with a single class of binding sites. Competitive binding studies using nonradioactive ACTH analogs served to establish the specificity of the binding. ACTH-(1-24), was the most active competitor, followed by [Gln5]ACTH-(1-20) amide, [Gln5,Phe9] ACTH-(1-24), and ACTH-(11-20) amide, the weakest binder of the group. These findings correlate well with the ability of the peptides to stimulate cAMP formation in bovine adrenal cortical cells, i.e. ACTH-(1-24) greater than [Gln5]ACTH-1-20) amide greater than [Gln5,Phe9]ACTH-(1-24). ACTH-(11-20) amide is biologically inactive but inhibits ACTH-(1-24)-stimulated adenylate cyclase with a 50% inhibition ratio of 400:1. Nonspecific binding was suppressed by inclusion in the incubates of the protease inhibitors pepstatin, bacitracin, and benzamidine. The binding protein was cross-linked to the radioactive probe with disuccinimidyl suberate with a high cross-linking yield. The cross-linked material was solubilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and the 100,000 X g supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by a autoradiography. The gel showed the presence of a band corresponding to an apparent mol wt of 43,000 (assuming a molecule of ligand bound). This band was absent when cross-linking was performed in the presence of unlabeled ACTH-(1-24). Similar results were obtained when cross-linking was performed with dithiobis (succinimidyl)propionate or ethyleneglycolbis (succinimidyl)succinate. The soluble cross-linked material bound to a column of succinoylavidin Sepharose and could be eluted with guanidinium chloride at pH 1.5. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of the affinity-purified material afforded the same pattern as the unpurified material; however, considerably more radioactivity was present in the high mol wt region of the gels.\r"

By two-dimensional electrophoresis, it splits into at least three components, two of which have more acidic pI than PRL. The tyrosine peptide maps of the three proteins resemble that of PRL. These results indicate that the 21,000 Mr band consists of a cluster of proteins that are structural variants of PRL, raising the possibility that these variants result from alternative splicing of the PRL gene transcript.\r"

Implants of DHEA led to plasma levels of DHEA and 5-androsten-3 beta,17 beta-diol covering the range of concentrations found in adult men while no significant change was observed in plasma levels of delta 4-dione, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). delta 4-Dione implants, on the other hand, led to a parallel increase in plasma delta 4-dione and testosterone levels at all doses used while plasma DHT only increased at supraphysiological doses of delta 4-dione. At plasma concentrations comparable to those found in adult men; delta 4-dione (0.8 ng/ml) and DHEA (3.4 ng/ml) stimulated prostate weight 3.7- and 2.1-fold, respectively. In the same groups, prostatic DHT levels were elevated at 4.48 +/- 0.05 and 2.70 +/- 0.73 ng/g tissue, respectively. A close parallelism was observed between prostatic DHT levels and prostatic weight in all groups. The present data show that in the rat, a species having no significant secretion of adrenal androgens, plasma concentrations of DHEA and delta 4-dione maintained within the range of those found in adult men are efficiently converted into DHT and act as potent androgenic stimuli in prostatic tissue. The castrated rat bearing Silastic implants releasing constant and predetermined amounts of adrenal steroids offers a good model to study the recently identified role of adrenal steroids in peripheral tissues.\r"

  ".U": "88296324\r", 
  ".W": "Increasing concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) led to a maximal 7-fold stimulation of growth of the highly androgen-sensitive clone (SEM-1) of the mammary carcinoma Shionogi cell line. Half-maximal stimulation by the estrogen was observed at 100 nM E2. Diethylstilbestrol (DES), on the other hand, a synthetic estrogen with no affinity for the androgen receptor, had no significant stimulatory effect on cell growth but caused growth inhibition at concentrations above 1 microM. Mediation of the action of E2 by the androgen receptor is indicated by the absence of interference of E2 action by the antiestrogen LY156758 while the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide (3 microM) caused a 50% inhibition of E2 action. While increasing concentrations of E2 led to a progressive increase in cell growth, a progressive shift in the ED50 value of action of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was observed at intermediate (10-100 nM) concentrations of E2 while 10 microM E2 completely inhibited DHT action. At those high E2 concentrations, however, E2 itself led to a stimulation of cell growth equivalent to approximately 50% of the maximal value achieved by DHT. E2 competed with the specific uptake of [3H]testosterone in intact cells at an inhibition constant (Ki) value of 15 nM, thus indicating direct interaction of E2 with the androgen receptor. Preincubation with E2 had no influence on the apparent affinity of testosterone for the androgen receptor nor on the number of androgen binding sites. The present data demonstrate that both the stimulatory and antiandrogenic action of E2 on the growth of the androgen-sensitive mammary carcinoma cell line SEM-1 are mediated through direct interaction of the estrogen with the androgen receptor. Such data may offer an explanation for the subjective improvements reported in prostate cancer patients receiving a high dose of E2 when relapsing after castration.\r"

  ".W": "alpha 1-Adrenergic stimulation of the pinealocyte translocates protein kinase-C, which, in turn, has an important positive effect on pineal cell function; translocation amplifies beta-adrenergic stimulation of both cAMP and cGMP. In the present report negative feedback effects of protein kinase-C are described, including inhibition of alpha 1-adrenergically induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, and cGMP in beta-adrenergically stimulated cells. Time-course studies of cGMP and [Ca2+]i responses indicated that the onset of inhibition by the protein kinase-C activator 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is rapid (less than 5 min). In contrast, PMA has no inhibitory effect on norepinephrine stimulation of cAMP accumulation or the induction of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase activity, a cAMP-dependent enzyme. This is consistent with the finding that PMA substitutes for the positive effect of alpha 1-activation and directly potentiates beta-adrenergic stimulation of cAMP production. Although PMA does inhibit alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of cGMP in beta-adrenergically treated cells, it does not inhibit the potentiation of the cGMP response in beta-adrenergically stimulated cells produced by high K+, A23187, and ouabain, agents that translocate protein kinase-C secondary to elevation of [Ca2+]i. This suggests that translocation of protein kinase-C does not block an effect of Ca2+, but probably blocks an earlier step in adrenergic activation, presumably the alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation of [Ca2+]i. Finally, pretreatment of cells with an alpha 1-agonist markedly reduced cAMP and cGMP responses to subsequent beta-adrenergic stimulation. The data indicate that the following negative feedback mechanism is present in the pinealocyte: alpha 1-adrenoceptor-dependent elevation of [Ca2+]i----protein kinase-C translocation----inhibition of alpha 1-adrenergic dependent elevation of [Ca2+]i. This mechanism appears to function physiologically to provide a negative feedback signal which limits adrenergic responses that are dependent on an increase in [Ca2+]i, including the cAMP and cGMP increases.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), a product of activated monocytes, induces tissue wasting in certain solid tumors in vivo and in in vitro model systems. Recent studies indicate that TNF alpha also regulates cell replication and expression of differentiated function in a variety of nonneoplastic cell systems. Since monocyte products could accumulate in bone with trauma, inflammation, or other disease states, bone cell activity might be altered by the presence of these pathophysiological molecules. Using cells obtained by sequential enzyme release from fetal rat parietal bone, we find that TNF alpha has acute stimulatory and inhibitory effects on bone cell macromolecular synthesis. Within 24 h of exposure, recombinant human TNF alpha at 0.3-100 nM progressively increases the rate of DNA synthesis in osteoblast-enriched cell cultures up to 3- to 4-fold, and 3-100 nM TNF alpha reduces collagen production and alkaline phosphatase activity by 20-30%. These decreases are not altered by 1 mM hydroxyurea, which blocks the mitogenic effect of TNF alpha by 85-90%. In addition, hydroxyproline levels in the culture medium do not increase relative to the control value after TNF alpha treatment, suggesting that decreased collagen production results from less synthesis rather than increased collagen degradation. Hybridization studies with cDNA encoding the alpha 1-chain of rat type I collagen show that TNF alpha increases type I collagen mRNA to an extent similar to its effect on cell replication. Therefore, TNF alpha appears to inhibit collagen synthesis and alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblast-enriched cell cultures by mechanisms that are not related to its effects on cell replication.\r"

Metabolic labeling, followed by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the rat brain and liver cells synthesized and secreted the following immunoreactive IGF-II peptides: 19, 11, 10, and 8.7 kilodaltons (kd), whereas the rat pituitary secreted the 10 and 8.7 kd peptides. However, the brain and pituitary explants failed to secrete the mature 7.5 kd IGF-II peptide which was a major species secreted by the liver cells. In the brain and pituitary, the predominant form of IGF-II peptide secreted was the 8.7 kd. This result suggests that 1) different mechanisms of processing of the IGF-II precursor and/or the preferential translation of different messenger RNA (mRNA) species may exist in different cell types, and 2) the 8.7 kd IGF-II peptide may be the biologically relevant molecule in the central nervous system of the rat.\r"

Type I iodothyronine-5'-deiodinating activity in the liver was significantly decreased in PFC mice but not in TNF-treated mice. The effect of TNF was reversible and could be abolished by boiling the cytokine. Furthermore, T3 and T4 response to TSH was greatly diminished in TNF-treated mice in comparison with PFC mice. These findings suggest that TNF directly inhibited the effect of TSH on the thyroid gland and decreased the serum concentrations of T4 and T3. Although TNF decreased food intake and body weight in TNF-treated mice, it did not decrease type I 5'-deiodinating activity in the liver, resulting in a greater T3/T4 ratio and lower serum rT3 concentration than those in PFC mice. We speculate that TNF is at least partly involved in the altered thyroid hormone metabolism (decreased serum T4, T3, and rT3 concentrations) caused by infections in mice.\r"

  ".W": "A PTH membrane receptor binding assay based on a stable hormone analog radioligand was refined and used with bovine renal cortical membranes to evaluate PTH reference peptides and novel analogs of the hormone. Systematic studies were performed to optimize several aspects of the receptor binding assay. The sulfur-free agonist analog [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(1-34)NH2 was iodinated using Iodogen. The monoiodinated derivative was purified and isolated by reverse phase HPLC. Immediate dilution of the purified radioligand in albumin-containing buffer and cold storage of aliquots yielded a tracer that was stable for at least 2 months. When used in the binding assay, the radioligand displayed specific, high affinity, and saturable binding to both bovine and canine renal cortical membranes. The Kd values were 0.47 +/- 0.07 and 0.63 +/- 0.08 nM for bovine and canine membranes, respectively. Maximum binding values were 475 +/- 46 and 395 +/- 48 fmol/mg protein for bovine and canine membranes, respectively. Furthermore, when used on a routine basis, this assay system proved reliable and reproducible. A series of previously characterized PTH agonists and antagonists was tested as reference peptides to validate this assay. Inhibition of binding by agents was dose dependent, parallel concentration-dependent binding curves were observed, and a close correlation between binding affinity and adenylate cyclase activity was obtained. In addition, a series of novel analogs designed to determine the consequences of sequence elongation at the N- and/or C-terminus or incorporation of amino acid substitutions to enhance resistance to enzymatic degradation were examined. With the exception of C-terminal extension from position 34 to position 38, which diminished receptor affinities, all modifications retained full biological activity. This refined receptor binding assay should facilitate future studies of newly designed PTH analogs.\r"

The serum GH-binding protein was recognized by antibodies produced against the hepatic GH receptor, and its mol wt (major form mol wt, approximately 41,800) was similar to that of low mol wt forms of the hepatic GH receptor, demonstrating the similarity of the serum GH-binding protein and the hepatic GH receptor. The apparent affinity of the serum GH-binding protein for mGH in untreated serum samples from 17-day pregnant mice was 6.9 X 10(7) M-1. However, when the serum was treated to remove endogenous GH, the apparent affinity increased to 1.5 X 10(8) M-1.

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to investigate changes in luteal cell cholesterol biosynthetic capacity, cholesterol accumulation, lipoprotein receptor activity, and in vivo steroidogenesis during pregnancy. Cholesterol biosynthetic capacity was assessed by measuring both the activity and the content of the rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase and by monitoring [14C]acetate incorporation into luteal sterols. The results showed that HMG-CoA reductase activity increased steadily during the first few days of pregnancy and reached a peak value on day 10. Subsequently, enzyme activity dropped precipitously and remained low until parturition. A parallel decline in the rate of conversion of 14C-labeled sterols was observed. Such changes in HMG-CoA reductase activity were not related to the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state of the enzyme, but were due to a reduction in the amount of enzyme protein, as determined by the immunoblotting technique. Despite the highly active HMG-CoA reductase in the first half of pregnancy, very little cholesterol ester was stored, and serum progesterone concentrations were only about 50-75 ng/ml. However, from midpregnancy, the corpus luteum became capable of storing more cholesterol ester and producing more progesterone at a time when its ability to synthesize cholesterol declined. At this stage, luteal cells appear to shut off de novo synthesis and use principally exogenous cholesterol. To find out whether this is due to an increase in the number of high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptors, HDL-binding activity was determined in luteal cells throughout pregnancy. Whereas the Kd and the number of binding sites per mg protein were similar between days 6-18, the total content of HDL receptor increased markedly with the size of the corpus luteum. In summary, the present investigation indicates that pregnancy profoundly influences the ability of the corpus luteum to acquire, synthesize, and process the cholesterol substrate needed for steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "88296336\r", 
  ".W": "We have developed a mouse marrow culture system, in which multinucleated cells (MNCs) are formed within 6-8 days. These MNCs showed several characteristics of osteoclasts, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) and the ability to resorb calcified dentine. 1 alpha, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha, 25 (OH)2D3] stimulated the formation of TRACP-positive MNCs, and salmon calcitonin (CT) inhibited it. In this study, we examined whether the TRACP-positive MNCs formed from mouse marrow cells possess CT receptors, another typical characteristic of osteoclasts. Mouse marrow cells cultured for 8 days with 10 nM 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 and freshly isolated authentic mouse osteoclasts were incubated with [125I]-salmon CT in the presence or absence of excess amounts of unlabeled CT, stained for TRACP, and processed for autoradiography. The [125I]-CT exclusively bound to TRACP-positive mononuclear cells and MNCs formed in the 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3-treated cultures and also to isolated mouse osteoclasts. Both [125I]-CT binding and TRACP activity were induced simultaneously on mononuclear cells on day 3 in the cultures treated with 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3. CT markedly stimulated cAMP production in the 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated cultures. The CT-dependent cAMP production increased in parallel with the increase in the number of TRACP-positive MNCs formed. Neither freshly isolated marrow cells nor cells cultured without 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 showed CT-induced cAMP accumulation. Furthermore, CT induced cytoplasmic contraction of both marrow-derived MNCs and isolated osteoclasts. These results clearly indicate that 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 induces TRACP activity and CT receptors almost simultaneously in mouse marrow cultures, and the MNCs formed in vitro respond to CT as authentic osteoclasts do.\r"

These modifications are hormonally regulated but remain poorly understood, and various complex mechanisms have been proposed. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and some characteristics of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in uterine blood vessels. Using monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry we observed the presence of ER and PR in muscle cells (tunica media) of uterine arteries of rabbits and women. ER or PR immunoreactivity was not detected in the endothelium of uterine arteries nor in uterine capillaries or veins. Staining for both receptors was also present in arterial walls from the fallopian tube (isthmus and ampulla) and vagina but not in arteries of nonreproductive tissues (intestinal, renal, hepatic, femoral, and pulmonary arteries, aorta). PR immuno-staining was increased by estrogen in all cell types of the rabbit uterus, but the doses necessary to provoke an intense nuclear staining in uterine arteries were higher than those required for observing strong labeling in glandular, stromal, or myometrial cells. These results suggest that, contrary to many hypotheses previously put forward, sex steroid hormones may regulate uterine blood flow through a direct effect on uterine arterial walls.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether affinity coupling of N-bromoacetyl-T3 (BrAcT3) to the T3 membrane carrier results in an inhibition of transport of T3 into the cell, rat hepatocytes in monolayer were incubated for 2 h at 21 C with 1.3 mumol/liter BrAcT3 in medium without protein. After extensive washing, cells were incubated during 20 h at 37 C with [125I]T3 in medium with 0.5% BSA, and products in supernatants were analyzed by LH-20 column chromatography. In addition the apparent affinity constant (Km) and maximal uptake velocity (Vmax) of the high affinity uptake process were estimated using 1 min incubations of hepatocytes with various concentrations of T3. In control experiments (i.e. without BrAcT3 affinity coupling) about 57% of the added T3 was cleared from the medium and further metabolized, 85% of the cleared T3 reappeared in the medium as I-, 15% as conjugates. Addition of propylthiouracil during the 20 h incubation with T3 strongly inhibited deiodination, without a change in T3 clearance. Because T3 is sulfated before deiodination, a concomitant rise in conjugates was observed. Addition of ouabain to control cells during the 20 h incubation with T3 strongly inhibited uptake, with a parallel decrease in I- and conjugate formation. After affinity coupling of BrAcT3, T3 clearance was inhibited (by 30% P less than 0.001). Since I- production was more depressed (by 73%) than T3 clearance, with some rise in conjugate formation (P less than 0.001), inhibition of deiodinase by BrAcT3 also took place. The effects of BrAcT3 and ouabain on uptake of T3 appeared to be additive as were the effects of propylthiouracil and BrAcT3 on deiodination. After affinity coupling of BrAcT3, the Km of T3 uptake did not change significantly; however Vmax was 54% lower (P less than 0.025) indicating a noncompetitive inhibition of the transport system. Preincubation of the cells with N-acetyl-T3 does not alter the characteristics of uptake of T3 by rat hepatocytes as compared to controls, indicating that no binding of this compound occurs. It is concluded that preincubation of hepatocytes with BrAcT3 diminished I- formation from T3; 50% of this inhibition is due to decreased membrane transport and 50% by reduction of deiodination. Inhibition of membrane transport by BrAcT3 is substantiated by a 54% lower Vmax without a significant change in Km as compared to control. The effect of transport of thyroid hormone on metabolism stresses the importance of the membrane carrier in the translocation process.\r"

  ".U": "88296340\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have revealed that pure unmodified hCG (hCGp) has little potency to inhibit the binding of bovine TSH (bTSH) to human thyroid membranes and to either stimulate adenylate cyclase or inhibit TSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase therein. On the other hand, preparations of crude hCG (hCGc) as well as enzymatically desialylated hCGp (asialo-hCGp) are relatively potent inhibitors of bTSH binding (TBI activity) and bTSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in human thyroid membrane preparations. In the present studies we have sought to identify and characterize the inhibitory moieties in crude hCG that are responsible for these inhibitory activities and to elucidate the properties of their interaction with the TSH receptor in human thyroid membranes. Preparations of hCGc were processed by DEAE-52 chromatography; this separated components of interest, which were not adsorbed, from intact hCGp, which was adsorbed to the column. The former were then subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, and the earliest eluting fractions, which proved to have the greatest TBI activity, were pooled, rechromatographed, and designated as variant hCG (hCGv). Three different preparations of hCGv were studied. All displayed a lower sialic acid content, by about half, than that in hCGp. Though their potencies varied somewhat, all had significant TBI activity, which was less than that of asialo-hCGp, but more than that of hCGc. Saturation studies revealed that the TBI activities of hCGv and asialo-hCGp were due to a competitive inhibition of bTSH binding at both the high and low affinity bTSH-binding sites, whereas the inhibitory activity of hCGc was exerted primarily at the low affinity binding site. Preparations of hCGv were also capable of inhibiting the adenylate cyclase response to TSH in human thyroid membranes, and Lineweaver-Burk analysis revealed this inhibition to be competitive in nature. As with its TBI activity, the potency of hCGv to inhibit the adenylate cyclase response was intermediate between that of asialo-hCGp and hCGc. Among the three batches of hCGv, their inhibitory effects on bTSH binding and adenylate cyclase activation appeared to vary inversely with with their sialic acid content. Enzymatic desialylation of hCGv increased its potency to that of asialo-hCGp. Several lines of evidence, as follows, indicate that the moieties that comprise hCGv are modified forms of hCGp itself. 1) On a unit weight basis, hCGv was at least as potent as hCGp in its ability to inhibit the binding of [125I]hCG to rat testicular membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In studies of regulation of the growth and differentiated function of the thyroid follicular cell, we have employed the FRTL5 cell line to evaluate both the effects of agents that activate protein kinase-C (PKC) and their interaction with other agents that influence the growth and/or function of the FRTL5 cell. The PKC activator tetradecanoyl-phorbol acetate (TPA) alone induced a time- and concentration-dependent stimulation of the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA of quiescent FRTL5 cells, an effect anteceded by an increase in the levels of the mRNAs of the proto-oncogene c-myc and associated with a stimulation of cell replication. TPA also produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the low levels of radioiodine uptake in quiescent FRTL5 cells. These effects of TPA were unaccompanied by any change in the cellular cAMP concentration. TPA also modified a variety of responses to TSH, attenuating the TSH-induced stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, cell replication, cAMP generation, and iodine uptake. Inhibition of TSH-stimulated growth and iodine uptake by TPA could not be ascribed solely to a decrease in cAMP generation, since TPA also inhibited the increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation and iodide uptake induced by the cAMP analog (Bu)2cAMP. In contrast, the independent stimulatory effects of TPA and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell replication were at least additive when the two stimulators were added together. We have previously reported that both TSH and (Bu)2cAMP amplify the enhancement of DNA synthesis and cell replication in FRTL5 cells induced by IGF-I, and that the response of DNA synthesis to IGF-I is also enhanced if cells are preincubated with either TSH or (Bu)2cAMP. Both the former amplification of mitogenesis and the latter priming effect were decreased by exposing cells to TPA concomitant with their exposure to TSH or (Bu)2cAMP. The effects of TPA were mimicked by other activators of PKC, but not by a phorbol ester that fails to activate this enzyme. In general, we conclude that in the FRTL5 cell, regulation of cell growth is extremely complex; there are at least three mitogenic pathways that are separate from but interact with one another. The first is the well known cAMP-dependent pathway, which is activated by TSH. The second is activated by IGF-I and is cAMP independent. These two pathways interact to produce a marked amplification of their individual mitogenic effects. The third pathway is that stimulated by TPA and involves activation of PKC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The cytosolic kinase was eluted from an anion exchange resin using a linear gradient of 0-0.15 M NaCl. A sharp peak of activity was demonstrated at approximately 80 mM using histone as a substrate. The kinase demonstrated a broad pH optimum of 6.5-8.0. ATP was the preferred phosphorus donor. The Ka for ATP averaged 2.6 +/- 0.1 microM (n = 4) and was not different in diabetic animals. Lysine-rich histones, but not arginine-rich or mixed histones, were the most suitable phosphorus acceptors. Phosphatidylserine stimulated kinase activity with Ka of 4.5 +/- 0.7 microM in the presence of 20 microM diolein (n = 3). Twenty micromolar diolein in the presence of 25 microM phosphatidylserine lowered the apparent Ka for calcium from 17.2 +/- 1.4 to 3.3 +/- 1.5 microM (n = 3; P less than 0.01). Similar data were evident in diabetic animals. Diabetic renal growth was induced by the injection of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg, iv). At the end of 4 weeks, blood glucose averaged 119.6 +/- 7.4 mg/dl in vehicle-injected controls and 548.7 +/- 21.6 mg/dl in diabetic animals (n = 5; P less than 0.001). Despite reduced weight gains in diabetic animals, renal protein content was increased in this group compared to the control value. Neither cytosolic nor proximal tubule basolateral membrane PKC activity changed after the induction of diabetes; however, luminal brush border PKC activity increased from 83.8 +/- 4.6 pmol/mg.min in control animals to 107.3 +/- 55 pmol/mg.min in diabetic animals (n = 5; P less than 0.02). The increased activity in the brush border membrane may have important consequences for the growth response of the kidney in diabetes.\r"

The stimulatory effects of isoproterenol and norepinephrine were almost completely reversed after 8 h incubation. The induction of 5'D activity by isoproterenol or norepinephrine was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol (5 X 10(-6) M). The effect of norepinephrine was not significantly affected by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin (10(-5) M).

  ".W": "GnRH and GnRH-associated peptide (GAP) have been shown to be cosecreted as spontaneous pulses in hypophysial portal blood. In addition, GAP has been proposed as a physiological inhibitor of PRL secretion. The present investigation was performed to determine whether GAP might play a role in the moment to moment regulation of PRL release in the ovariectomized rat. We anticipated that an inverse relation might exist between PRL and LH pulses if GAP is a physiological regulator of PRL and is coreleased with GnRH. Serial blood samples were collected at 6-min intervals over 4 h from ovariectomized rats bearing chronic jugular catheters and were analyzed for plasma concentrations of PRL and LH by RIA. Release patterns were assessed using a pulse detection algorithm. Some animals were pretreated 30 min before blood sampling with domperidone (a dopamine antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier) to unmask PRL inhibitory responses to GAP that might not otherwise be observable in the presence of normal dopamine inhibition. PRL secretory patterns were pulsatile but highly irregular, in contrast to the regular rhythmic patterns of circulating LH. Domperidone treatment significantly increased the number of PRL pulses. PRL pulse amplitudes, and mean PRL concentrations compared to those in vehicle-injected controls. LH pulses after domperidone administration were more frequent, resulting in slightly higher mean LH concentrations. In both vehicle- and domperidone-injected rats, 60-80% of PRL pulses were concordant with LH pulses (concordance defined as PRL and LH peaks occurring within one sample of each other). Assuming that GAP is cosecreted with GnRH, these data fail to support an acute physiological role for GAP during undisturbed PRL release in the ovariectomized rat because the expected relation between PRL and LH pulses in the event of such a role was not observed. To test a role for GAP more directly, domperidone-treated rats were injected with a rabbit anti-GAP serum during serial blood collection. No increase in PRL release was elicited by this treatment, and pulsatile PRL and LH secretion were unaffected compared to those in control animals injected with hyperimmune serum. To determine whether GnRH is the PRL-releasing secretagogue responsible for concordant PRL and LH pulses, some rats were pretreated 4 h before blood sampling with a potent GnRH antagonist, followed by domperidone 30 min before sampling. Treatment with GnRH antagonist virtually abolished LH pulses, but had no effect on PRL pulses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A single-step procedure was devised to separate PRL cells from the rat anterior pituitary gland. After dissociation, cells were centrifuged on a Percoll gradient. Three layers were recovered. The composition of the different layers was evaluated using immunocytochemistry (with antisera to the six pituitary hormones), and in situ hybridization [with DNA complementary to PRL or to GH messenger RNA (mRNA)]. Both methods yielded identical values. PRL cells were recovered in the lower density layer (layer 1) with a good yield (that is 81% of the total PRL cells of the initial cell suspension) and in addition, markedly enriched (indeed 85% of the cells in layer 1 stained for PRL). A second layer (layer 2: intermediate density) contained most of the remaining PRL cells which were, however, heavily contaminated mainly by GH cells and cells that did not stain for any of the known pituitary hormones. A third layer (layer 3: higher density) was enriched in GH cells to 93% (representing, however, only 10% of the initial pituitary GH cells). In addition, PRL and GH were measured by RIA in culture medium and in cell lysates. Hormone biosynthesis was monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography after culture in the presence of [35S]methionine. These experiments confirmed that layer 1 was enriched in cells containing, and producing, PRL and depleted from GH cells. Cells in layer 2 contained and produced more GH than PRL. PRL cells from layer 1 responded to dopamine and to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the same way as PRL cells in the unseparated pituitary cell population. In contrast PRL cells in layer 2 had a lower basal secretion rate but a higher response to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Unless this represents a paracrine effect of non-PRL cells, PRL cells in layer 2 exhibit different properties and may therefore form a distinct subpopulation of PRL cells.\r"

  ".U": "88296353\r", 
  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that in the female sheep, a short day (SD) breeder, puberty can occur normally in the absence of ambient short days. More specifically, the photoperiod cue timing the transition into adulthood is exposure to and then termination of a long day melatonin rhythm. Control lambs born in the spring were exposed to 5 weeks of long days (LD; 16 h of light, 8 h of darkness; 18-23 weeks of age) and were raised in SD (8 h of light, 16 h of darkness) at other times. As expected from previous studies, this alternating photoperiod sequence (SD-LD-SD) induced puberty at the normal age in autumn [33 +/- 2 weeks (mean +/- SEM); n = 6]. The other three groups were exposed only to LD from birth; the superior cervical ganglia were removed bilaterally at different ages to denervate the pineal gland in order to block transduction of subsequent LD cues. Puberty occurred normally (31 +/- 1 weeks; n = 7) after ganglionectomy at 23 weeks of age, indicating that ambient short days are not required to initiate reproductive cycles. LD are necessary, as evidenced by the results for the other two groups ganglionectomized neonatally at 4 weeks of age. With no further treatment, puberty was either delayed (n = 1) or did not occur during the first year of life (n = 5), after which the study ended. This delay was prevented in the other group of ganglionectomized lambs by a 5-week (18-23 weeks of age) exposure to LD melatonin patterns by means of 8-h melatonin infusions nightly; 12 weeks after melatonin replacement therapy, puberty occurred at the normal time (34 +/- 1 weeks; n = 6). The inference is that for puberty to occur in the female lamb the animal must be exposed to relatively limited periods of LD, followed by the blockade or absence of further LD cues (pineal denervation, termination of LD melatonin infusion, or presence of SD). This supports the concept that the LD of summer, followed by their disappearance in autumn, time puberty in the female sheep.\r"

The binding is thermolabile, saturable, and specific for glucocorticoid. The apparent dissociation constant (Kdapp) for [3H]dexamethasone (0.48 +/- 0.084 microM) is 60-fold greater than that for cytosolic receptor (7.9 +/- 1.5 nM). The Kdapp for [3H]cortisol in particulate fractions is 2.5-fold lower than for [3H]dexamethasone (Kdapp = 0.18 microM). The binding capacities for particulate and cytosolic glucocorticoid-binding sites also differ significantly, with particulate sites at least 9.1-fold more concentrated than cytosolic sites in liver tissue. Particulate sites are determined in Percoll density gradients to have a density of 1.039 g/cc. Saturable [3H]dexamethasone radioactivity coelutes from these gradients with the plasma membrane marker enzyme 5'-nucleotidase. Adrenalectomy causes the complete loss of particulate binding sites by 6 days postadrenalectomy; however, these sites can be regenerated to two thirds of the nonadrenalectomy level by 20-30 days postadrenalectomy.\r"

  ".U": "88296357\r", 
  ".W": "Bovine granulosa cells were isolated from small antral, medium antral, and large Graffian follicles (i.e. small, medium, and large preovulatory follicles). Serum-free cultures of granulosa cells were established and found to be viable for 3-6 days of cell culture. Radiolabeled granulosa cell-secreted proteins were obtained and analyzed electrophoretically. No major changes were detected in the protein profiles of small, medium, and large follicle granulosa cells. FSH and insulin, however, had a dramatic effect on granulosa cell-secreted proteins and increased the apparent production of 200K, 65K, 25K, and 15K proteins. The effects of these hormones on the radiolabeled secreted proteins were similar for small, medium, and large follicle granulosa cells. Aromatase activity was high for the first day of serum-free granulosa cell culture and subsequently declined to low levels. Both FSH and insulin alone stimulated aromatase activity, while a combination of hormones resulted in an additive response similar to the stimulation observed with 10% calf serum. Although the level of aromatase activity increased slightly with the size of the follicle, the effects of hormones were independent of follicle size. Progesterone production was low on days 1 and 2 of serum-free granulosa cell culture and high on days 3 and 6 of cell culture. Interestingly, FSH and insulin suppressed progesterone production on day 1 of cell culture for small and medium follicle granulosa cells, but not for large follicle cells. In contrast, hormones stimulated progesterone production on days 3 and 6 of granulosa cell culture, and the level of progesterone production increased with the size of the follicle. The stimulatory effects of hormones on days 3 and 6 of the culture were similar for medium and large follicle granulosa cells, but were altered for small follicle cells. Results indicate that when aromatase activity is high and stimulated by hormones, progesterone levels are low and generally suppressed by the same regulatory agents. Conversely when progesterone levels are high and hormone responsive, aromatase activity is low. The inverse relationship between aromatase activity and progesterone production implies that bovine granulosa cells alter their differentiated state in culture from an estrogen-producing cell to a progesterone-producing cell. Combined observations indicate that the results obtained on day 1 of culture probably reflect the developmental and hormonal regulation of granulosa cell function in the preovulatory follicle, while data obtained at later times in culture reflect the ability of the cell to synthesize progesterone and develop a luteinization-like activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A simple method to calculate the amount of dietary (protein, sodium and potassium) intake in hemodialyzed patients was developed. In 8 nutritionally stable patients, the amount of dietary intake was monitored conventionally by a dietary record method. In contrast, assuming that the amount of dietary intake was equal to the amount of accumulation in the body, the former was calculated as the change in the product of serum concentrations and total body fluid volume, which was estimated based on the sex and body build of each patient. The urea accumulation was converted to the protein intake. The interdialytic dietary protein and sodium intake calculated by this method, 120 +/- 10 g and 240 +/- 40 mEq, respectively, was not significantly different from that obtained by the dietary record, while the interdialytic potassium accumulation, 60 +/- 7 mEq, was significantly smaller than the dietary intake, 110 +/- 9 mEq, obtained by the record method, though the correlation was significant. Thus, the amount of protein and sodium intake can be calculated simply without diet research or body fluid volume measurements. Although potassium intake can not be calculated exactly because of intestinal loss, this simple method gives us a rough estimate. In addition, multiple regression analysis showed that the amount of energy intake obtained by the record method may be explained by the protein and sodium intake estimated by simple calculation.\r"

  ".U": "88297865\r", 
  ".W": "The goal of shortening dialysis treatment time has stimulated the development of new, highly efficient dialytic strategies. In this study the Authors compared four different short dialysis treatments in terms of efficiency, clinical tolerance, technological investment and costs: 1) Rapid bicarbonate dialysis with 1.5 sq.m. cuprophane membrane; 2) High flux biofiltration with 1.2 sq.m. AN69S hollow fiber membrane; 3) Hemodiafiltration with 1.2-1.9. sq.m. polysulphonic hollow fiber hemodiafilters, and 4) High flux hemodiafiltration with two serial hemodiafilters with AN69s membrane (total 2.4 sq.m.). Hydraulic properties and solute clearances at different blood flows (300-500 ml/min) were tested for each technique. Once the optimal operative level was established three patients were treated with each technique for at least six months. Since BUN clearance averaged 310 ml/min, the treatment duration varied from 120 to 180 min/session with KT/V always higher than 1. The average protein catabolic rate was 0.9 g/kg/24h. Clinical tolerance was generally good, slightly better in treatments with a high convective component. Despite the greater efficiency of treatment No. 4, the technological requirements and costs are such that the others are currently more feasible and acceptable in clinical routine. The study demonstrates that reduction of dialysis treatment time is possible in all centres in a selected population with adequate blood access. Treatment No. 1 can even be performed with standard equipment and cuprophan membranes, while bicarbonate in the dialysate is mandatory. The real limit to shortening treatment time seems to be related to the maximal rate of ultrafiltration achievable in the patient during dialysis.\r"

These findings suggest that in patients with tuberculosis on maintenance dialysis, treatment should be either with higher doses of these two drugs, or with additional replacement doses given after each dialysis. Further detailed pharmacokinetic studies on larger numbers of patients are indicated.\r"

A linear compressor was selected as a portable size compressor. To reduce the number of parts to be assembled, a new type of pneumatic system was employed. In this system, the pressure level was regulated by varying the output flow rate of the compressor instead of using a pressure regulator and large air reservoirs. A one-board microcomputer and pressure sensors were used to control the pressure level. The total weight of the unit is 9.5 Kg. After assembling the components into the portable unit, a blood pump was connected to examine the output characteristics of the system. It was confirmed that the unit could drive the blood pump continuously for more than 2 hours under the following conditions: output flow rate of the blood pump = 5 L/min and output pressure = 100 mmHg.\r"

  ".W": "Several kinds of plasma fractionators have been introduced to actively separate protein fractions between albumin and globulins in double filtration plasmapheresis. However, relatively large molecular weight proteins are known to be partially trapped by the membrane in a plasma fractionator. In this paper, effects of membrane trapping on separation characteristics in plasma fractionators were examined during in vitro and in vivo studies. All in vitro experiments were done with a closed circuit under constant-flow rate filtration. Protein concentration in feed tank kept constant at no filtration in AS-14H, Evaflux 4A and 2A, while 20-40% of IgG and 40-60% of beta-lipoprotein in 2 liter plasma were removed by membrane trapping for 300 min when filtration fraction equaled 0.87. Protein plugging to the membrane seems to be a major factor in these proteins. And, Dead-end and Partially Discarded modalities with relatively high filtration fraction are effective for the separation between albumin and globulin. Twenty-seven DFPP treatments in 13 patients with autoimmune diseases were done to allow us to estimate the effects of membrane trapping during an in vivo study. All treatments using 6 types of plasma fractionator were performed under constant operating conditions with Partially Discarded modality. In any plasma fractionator, beta-lipoprotein was fairly trapped at 30 min after the start of treatment.\r"

Results were compared with those obtained without PE. Diclofenac and paracetamol were chosen because they presented different volume distribution and protein binding characteristics. Vidarabine was studied because we use it for the treatment of patients with polyarteritis nodosa related to hepatitis B virus. Diclofenac (100 mg) and paracetamol (1000 mg) were given 1 hour before PE. Samples were obtained 60 and 30 min before PE, every 15 min during PE and hourly for 2 hours after the end of PE. Vidarabine was given in continuous infusion, 15 mg/kg/d during the first week of treatment and 7.5 mg/kg/d during subsequent weeks. Samples were obtained before PE, 3 times during PE and every 30 min for 4 hours after the end of PE. Paracetamol, diclofenac, vidarabine and hypoxanthine arabinoside were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. During each PE 60 ml/kg were removed and replaced by albumin. We found that 17% of diclofenac, 4.3% of paracetamol and 4.9% of vidarabine were removed during each session. Plasmapheresis clearance was 51% of plasma clearance for diclofenac, 15% for paracetamol and 10% for vidarabine. Drugs which are mainly removed during PE are those which are bound to proteins with a small distribution volume. Those drugs, such as diclofenac, must be administered after the end of each PE session. Drugs which present a large distribution volume and low protein binding can be given before the session. Vidarabine can be administered during PE without loss of effectiveness due to drug removal.\r"

Plasma separated by a membrane separator was warmed above physiologic temperature, filtered with a plasma filter and returned to the patient on-line without requiring supplemental plasma product infusion. One calculated plasma volume was treated. Treatment schedules were weekly, biweekly or monthly. Patients treated by thermofiltration in this study were diagnosed as type II hypercholesterolemia. Reductions and sievings of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were evaluated. In addition, post-treatment solute recovery was assessed. The reduction ratios of HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were 0.31 +/- 0.08 and 0.58 +/- 0.08, respectively (mean +/- S.D. of 7 patients). Sieving coefficients of the plasma filter for HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were 0.62 +/- 0.12 and 0.03 +/- 0.02, respectively (mean +/- S.D. of 32 treatments). Cholesterol reduction fitted well to a single pool model. HDL cholesterol recovered significantly faster than LDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol recovery differed among individuals. For some patients total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were lowered by the biweekly treatment while for others the weekly treatment was required. Significant removal of LDL cholesterol with sparing of HDL cholesterol was achieved without the requirement for plasma products.\r"

In the present study, we administered FUT and dipyridamole as anticoagulants during donor plasmapheresis, and the additional effect of dipyridamole was examined. In dogs weighing about 15 Kg, donor plasmapheresis was performed using a cellulose triacetate membrane plasmaseparator (PEX-15, Nipro), and 300 ml of filtrated plasma was obtained within 30 minutes. These dogs were divided into two groups, 50 mg/h of FUT alone was infused (group A, n = 10), and the same dose of FUT and 25 mg/h of dipyridamole were infused (group B, n = 5) during plasmapheresis. Changes of the coagulation system, blood cell counts and complement system were investigated. In clinical cases, an artificial liver support therapy using FUT as an anticoagulant was performed on 8 patients with acute liver failure, and blood compatibility was examined. In dogs, RBC counts and hematocrits were almost stable, but WBC counts were decreased to about 70% of the previous value. Platelets counts were about 60% and 80% of the previous value, in group A and group B, respectively, at the end of the plasmapheresis (P less than 0.01). Clotting factor VII was diminished to about 20% and 35% of the previous value in group A and B, respectively. In clinical cases, all patients received the plasma exchange combined with hemodialysis using FUT as an anticoagulant, and no distinct side effect was observed during plasma exchange.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the rectal (Tre), esophageal (Tes), and skin (Tsk) temperature changes in a group of trained traumatic paraplegic men pushing their own wheelchairs on a motor-driven treadmill for a prolonged period in a neutral environment. There were two experiments. The first experiment (Tre and Tsk) involved a homogeneous group (T10-T12/L3) of highly trained paraplegic men [maximum O2 uptake (VO2max) 47.5 +/- 1.8 ml.kg-1.min-1] exercising for 80 min at 60-65% VO2max.Tre and Tsk (head, arm, thigh, and calf) and heart rate (HR) were recorded throughout. O2 uptake (VO2), minute ventilation (VE), CO2 production (VCO2), and heart rate (HR) were recorded at four intervals. During experiment 1 significant changes in HR and insignificant changes in VCO2, VE, and VO2 occurred throughout prolonged exercise. Tre increased significantly from 37.1 +/- 0.1 degrees C (rest) to 37.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C after 80 min of exercise. There were only significant changes in arm Tsk. Experiment 2 involved a nonhomogeneous group (T5-T10/T11) of active paraplegics (VO2max 39.9 +/- 4.3 ml.kg-1.min-1) exercising at 60-65% VO2max for up to 45 min on the treadmill while Tre and Tes were simultaneously recorded. Tes rose significantly faster than Tre during exercise (dT/dt 20 min: Tes 0.050 +/- 0.003 degrees C/min and Tre 0.019 +/- 0.005 degrees C/min), and Tes declined significantly faster than Tre at the end of exercise. Tes was significantly higher than Tre at the end of exercise. Our results suggest that during wheelchair propulsion by paraplegics, Tes may be a better estimate of core temperature than Tre.\r"

Ventilation was measured with an inductive plethysmograph (Respitrace), and diaphragmatic electromyogram (DEMG) was studied with a bipolar esophageal electrode. During NPV a 1:1 phase lock was observed between subjects and iron lung frequency in all subjects. Tidal volume increased in most subjects, more with high than with low pressures (P less than 0.05), whereas DEMG increased, decreased, or showed no change. Postinspiratory inspiratory diaphragmatic activity (PIIA) significantly increased during high-pressure NPV and was accompanied by an increase in tonic DEMG in one-half of the subjects. Voluntary relaxation resulted in a decrease in DEMG and PIIA. We suggest that cortical activity can explain persistency of active breathing during negative-pressure ventilation.\r"

Specific beta 2-adrenergic receptor blockade (ICI 118.551) significantly decreased CBFV and increased LDCR by blockade of beta 2-vasodilator tone independent of alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated tone and independent of altering myocardial metabolism. alpha-Adrenergic receptor blockade (phentolamine, 1 mg) significantly increased CBFV and decreased LDCR by blocking sympathetically mediated vasoconstrictor tone. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of response between alpha- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor blockade. These results demonstrate that alpha- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors have a significant and evidently equal influence on CBFV and LDCR during exercise. Four weeks of daily exercise and left stellate ganglionectomy (LSGx) prevented phentolamine-induced vasodilation but not ICI 118.551-induced vasoconstriction. This suggests that daily exercise and LSGx significantly decreased the alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor tone on the coronary circulation, resulting in an apparently greater role for the coronary vascular beta 2-adrenergic receptor on the control of CBFV and LDCR during exercise.\r"

Eight rabbits were studied (anesthetized and postmortem) using lard-filled bags to simulate cervical fat accumulation. Additionally, a handheld device was used to apply measured loads at localized sites along the airway. Upper airway resistance and closing pressure (a reflection of airway stability) were determined before and after loading. Endoscopy revealed concentric narrowing of the pharynx during loading in anesthetized and postmortem preparations. Upper airway resistance was increased by mass loads, with larger loads having greater effects. Loading caused decreased airway stability as reflected by closing pressures. The area over the thyrohyoid membrane was more vulnerable to mass loading than adjacent areas. Because mass loading of the upper airway causes changes in its configuration and function similar to those seen in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), we speculate that such loading may contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA associated with obesity.\r"

In contrast, when similarly rapid interruptions of active expirations were produced with the tongue on a mouthpiece (utterance, te-te-te-te) or with an external valve, no synchronous bursts were observed. Since all interruptions would have been mechanically similar at expiratory muscular and pulmonary levels, we reasoned that the bursts with glottic interruptions were either programmed centrally or driven reflexly at the laryngeal level.\r"

Measurements were made with principal ponies in clinical remission (period A) and during an acute period of airway obstruction (period B). beta-Adrenergic blockade did not change airway responsiveness, dynamic compliance (Cdyn), or pulmonary resistance (RL) in either group of ponies at period A or in the control ponies at period B. In principal ponies at period B, propranolol significantly increased RL but was without effect on Cdyn or airway responsiveness. We conclude that the beta-adrenergic system is involved in the control of central airway caliber in principal ponies at period B but that this system does not seem to be involved in the mechanism of airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine.\r"

Four minutes of exercise (flexion duration = 1 s) reduced maximal developed force from 100 to 74 +/- 9% and pH from 6.99 +/- 0.04 to 6.17 +/- 0.33 and increased H2PO4- to 927 +/- 401% of resting levels. In all subjects, linear relationships were noted between developed force and pH (r = 0.90 +/- 0.08) and between developed force and H2PO4- (r = -0.89 +/- 0.08). Doubling the contraction duration to 2 s produced more rapid changes in developed force, pH, and H2PO4- but no change in the relationship of force to pH and H2PO4-. Two minutes of submaximal exercise before maximal exercise significantly reduced pH and increased H2PO4-. During subsequent maximal exercise, the relationship between developed force and H2PO4- remained unchanged. In contrast, the relationship between developed force and pH was shifted leftward; muscle pH remained lower throughout maximal exercise, and developed force remained comparable to that noted during control exercise. These observations suggest that muscle fatigue during intense short-term exercise is primarily caused by an increase in intramuscular H2PO4- rather than by a decrease in intramuscular pH.\r"

Studies that utilize this model assume that nodal transit does not alter the composition of lymph. We collected afferent lymph from the tracheobronchial node (TBN) while simultaneously collecting CMN efferent lymph in acutely prepared sheep. We compared afferent and efferent lymph protein concentrations (CA and CE) and changes in flow rates (QLA and QLE) during base line and periods of elevated left atrial pressure (Pla). As a result of elevated Pla, QLA and QLE increased and the afferent lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (CA/Cp) and the efferent lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (CE/Cp) fell. The CA/Cp was significantly lower than the CE/Cp during base line (0.67 vs. 0.80) and periods of elevated Pla (0.41 vs. 0.61). Although we cannot exclude regional permeability differences, the difference between CA/Cp and CE/Cp is most likely due to the concentration of lymph within the CMN. Our data suggest nodal modification of CA is correlated with the afferent lymph-to-plasma colloid osmotic pressure ratio (pi A/pi p) and further suggest that nodal alteration of lymph during elevated Pla is due to the influence of decreased pi A/pi p at the blood-to-lymph barrier. We conclude that afferent lymph is a more accurate representation of lung free interstitial fluid because collection of pulmonary afferent lymph obviates the complications introduced by the CMN. Studies utilizing efferent lymph may have overestimated lung microvascular permeability in the acute sheep preparation.\r"

After 10 min of ventilation at tidal volumes of 12-15 ml/kg, static pressure-volume measurements were made. At all surfactant doses there was a significantly higher maximal lung volume, higher dynamic compliance, and lower pressure requirement in the corticosteroid-treated than in the control rabbits (P less than 0.01). Control animals showed incremental improvements in dynamic compliances and maximal lung volumes up to a dose of 50 mg/kg, whereas corticosteroid treated animals improved to a maximum at the low dose of 15 mg/kg (P less than 0.01). However, surface tension as assessed by lung stability index improved with increasing surfactant dose but was not significantly different between corticosteroid-treated and control animals at a given dose. The results imply that maternal corticosteroid treatment potentiates surfactant replacement by a change in lung structure that is independent of surface tension effects.\r"

Isolated rabbit lungs were degassed, and the air spaces and vasculature were inflated with a silicon rubber compound. After the rubber had hardened the caudal lobes were sliced into 1-cm-thick slabs. Two chambers were bonded to opposite sides of a slab enclosing a large blood vessel and were filled with saline containing 3 g/dl albumin. The flow through the interstitium surrounding the vessel was measured at a constant driving pressure of 5 cmH2O and at various mean interstitial pressures. Flow decreased with a reduction of mean interstitial pressure and reached a limiting minimum value at approximately -9 cmH2O. The pressure-flow behavior was analyzed under the assumptions that the interstitium is a porous material described by a single permeability constant that increases with hydration and that the expansion of the interstitium with interstitial pressure was due to the elastic response of the surrounding rubber compound. This resulted in an interstitial resistance (reciprocal of permeability constant) of 1.31 +/- 1.03 (SD) cmH2O.h.cm-2 and a ratio of interstitial cuff thickness to vessel radius of 0.022 +/- 0.007 (SD), n = 11. The phenomenon of flow limitation was demonstrated by holding the upstream pressure constant at 15 cmH2O and measuring the flow while the downstream pressure was reduced. The flow was limited at downstream pressures below -10 cmH2O.\r"

Eight men cycled twice at 45-50% their maximum work rate until exhaustion at ambient temperature and relative humidity of 38 degrees C and 90-95%, respectively. They inspired either cold (3.6 degrees C) or ambient air in random sequence. When subjects breathed cold air during 23 min of exercise, a ninefold increase in RHL was observed vs. similar work during hot air inhalation (32.81 vs. 3.46 W). Respiratory frequency (f) and rate of rise in Tre decreased significantly (P less than or equal to 0.004 and P less than or equal to 0.002, respectively). The rise in skin temperature in each inhalant gas condition was accompanied by a parallel almost equal increase in core temperature above basal (delta Tre) for equivalent gains in skin temperature. The increase in tidal volume and decreased f in the cold condition allowed more effective physical conditioning of cold inspirate gas in the upper airways and aided RHL. Cold air inhalation also produced a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) decrease in heart rate vs. hot air inhalation in the final stages of exercise. Insignificant changes in O2 consumption and total body fluid loss were found. These data show that cold air inhalation during exercise diminishes elevation of Tre and suggest that both the intensity and duration of work can thus be extended. The importance of the physical exchange of heat energy and any physiological mechanisms induced by the cold inspirate in producing the changes is undetermined.\r"

The percentage decrease in isometric tension from beginning to end of the fatiguing process was used as the index of fatigue. The experiments were carried out at different PO2 levels in both normal and zero-glucose Ringer solutions. It was found that fatigue developed more rapidly in isotonic contractions than in isometric ones.

Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained 5 days/wk for 6 wk with a program consisting of 6 bouts/day of 2.5-min runs at 60 m/min up a 15% grade with 4.5-min rest periods between bouts. After training, blood flows were measured with the radiolabeled microsphere technique (phase I) in pair-weighted sedentary control and exercise-trained rats while they ran at 60 m/min (0% grade). In phase II of the study, regional vascular flow capacities were determined at three perfusion pressures (30, 40, and 50 mmHg) in isolated perfused hindquarters of control and trained rats maximally vasodilated with papaverine. The results indicate that this exercise training program produces increases in the vascular flow capacity of fast-twitch glycolytic muscle tissue of rats. However, these changes were not apparent in the magnitude or distribution of muscle blood flow in conscious rats running at 60 m/min, since blood flows within and among muscles during exercise were the same in trained and control rats.\r"

At 27 mo, soleus muscle mass of trained rats was 113% of sedentary control values, whereas EDL muscle mass was unaffected by training. At 27 mo, food restriction had no effect on the mass of both muscles compared with 27-mo sedentary control values. Fiber number was not affected by training or food restriction in both muscles. Fiber number for soleus and EDL muscles of combined groups declined with age by 5.6 and 4.2%, respectively.

VIP did not change resting tension up to 2 X 10(-7) M, but it showed a biphasic effect on the responses to EFS. In concentrations up to 10(-9) M, VIP potentiated the response; at higher concentrations VIP reduced responses. Thus, at a concentration of 10(-9) M, VIP decreased the mean (+/- SE) log EFS frequency, producing 50% of maximum contraction significantly from a control value of 0.476 +/- 0.062 to 0.214 +/- 0.057 Hz (P less than 0.01); at a concentration of 2 X 10(-7) M VIP increased the half-maximal frequency from a control value of 0.513 +/- 0.086 to 0.752 +/- 0.053 Hz (P less than 0.05).

In contrast to EFS-induced contraction, contractions produced by acetylcholine (10(-9) to 10(-3) M) were not affected by VIP at concentrations of 10(-9) and 2 X 10(-7) M. These results suggest that VIP modulates contractions produced by EFS via presynaptic cholinergic mechanisms and probably through a specific VIP receptor.\r"

Rats given 0.9 or 0.45% NaCl solution regained fluid loss completely in 3-3.5 h, whereas those given 0.2% solution became fully rehydrated at 10 h. The rats in the tap water and 2.0% NaCl groups were only 78 and 59% rehydrated, respectively, within 16 h. Na balance was positive in the 0.9% NaCl group by about five times the amount of the cations lost during the dehydration period. A positive balance of Na was also observed in the 0.45 (approximately 250%) and 2.0% NaCl groups (300%), whereas the 0.2% NaCl group regained lost water and Na simultaneously at 10 h. With tap water, additional loss of cations was observed. These findings show that for the replacement of water due to thermal dehydration there is a range of NaCl concentration with which the rats can rehydrate with the mutual cooperation of thirst, salt appetite, and kidney function.\r"

Nine healthy males wearing only shorts were subjected to immersion to the neck in water at 0.6, 1, and 2 ATA while resting for 2 h. Continuous measurements included esophageal (Tes) and skin (Tsk) temperatures, direct heat loss from the skin (Htissue), and insulation of the tissue (Itissue). The Tcw was significantly higher at 0.6 ATA than 1 and 2 ATA: however, Tcw at 1 ATA was identical to that at 2 ATA. The metabolic heat production remained unchanged among the pressures. During the 2-h immersion in Tcw, Tes was identical among all atmospheric pressures: however, Tsk was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) at 0.6 ATA and was identical between 1 and 2 ATA. The overall mean Itissue was near maximal during immersion in Tcw in each pressure, and no difference was detected among the pressures. However, Itissue at the acral extremities (arm, hand, and foot) decreased significantly at 0.6 ATA, and subsequently heat loss from these parts was increased, which elevated an extremity-to-trunk heat loss ratio to 1.4 at 0.6 ATA from 1.1 at 1 and 2 ATA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Muscle O2 stores were depleted rapidly by forearm ischemia manifest by a progressive decrease in tissue oxyhemoglobin and oxymyoglobin over 4-5 min. Muscle ischemia significantly decreased the oxidation level of cytochrome aa3, to below resting base line after only 1.5 min, and the enzyme became fully reduced after 6.5 min. After 8 min of ischemia, tourniquet release was accompanied by a transient increase in muscle blood volume due to influx of oxyhemoglobin. The cytochrome aa3 oxidation level increased above resting base line within 1 min after tourniquet release. Transcutaneous PO2 measurements recorded simultaneously from the same forearm correlated poorly with the kinetics of O2 availability and cytochrome oxidation in the underlying muscle tissue; this was not unexpected because overlying skin did not contribute significantly to NIR muscle signals. Venous outflow restriction without inflow obstruction increased muscle deoxyhemoglobin and tissue blood volume but did not change muscle O2 stores or cytochrome aa3 oxidation level. The ability of the NIR technique to detect dynamic trends in tissue oxygenation reveals that muscle O2 is rapidly consumed during tourniquet ischemia and rapidly restored by hyperemic responses after brief ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Large-amplitude vibration of the intercostal muscles/ribs has an inhibitory effect on inspiratory motor output. This effect has been attributed, in part, to the stimulation of intercostal muscle tendon organs. Intercostal muscle/rib vibration can also produce a decrease or increase in respiratory frequency. Studies were conducted 1) to determine whether, in addition to intercostal tendon organs, costovertebral joint mechanoreceptors (CVJR's) contribute to the inspiratory inhibitory effect of intercostal muscle/rib vibration (IMV) and 2) to explain the different respiratory frequency responses to IMV previously reported. Phrenic (C5) activity was monitored in paralyzed thoracotomized, artificially ventilated cats. Vibration (125 Hz) at amplitudes greater than 1,200 micron of one T6 intercostal space in decerebrated vagotomized rats reduced phrenic activity. This response was still present but weaker in some animals after denervation of the T6 intercostal muscles. Subsequent denervation of the T6 CVJR's by dorsal root sections eliminated this effect. Respiratory frequency decreased during simultaneous vibration (greater than 1,200 micron) of the T5 and T7 intercostal spaces in vagotomized cats. Respiratory frequency increased during IMV of two intercostal spaces (greater than 1,300 micron) in vagal intact cats. The use of different anesthetics (pentobarbital, allobarbital) did not alter these results. We conclude that CVJR's may contribute to the inhibitory effect of IMV on medullary inspiratory activity. The presence or absence of pulmonary vagal afferents can account for the different respiratory frequency responses to IMV, and different anesthetics did not influence these results.\r"

Kf was calculated from rate of weight gain as described by Drake et al. [Am. J. Physiol. 234 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 3): H266-H274, 1978]. These calculations were made twice during base line and then at hourly intervals for 5 h after infusion of 5 mg (approximately 250 micrograms/kg) of E. coli endotoxin or after injection of oleic acid (47 microliter/kg). All lungs were perfused at constant arterial and venous pressure under zone 3 conditions. Base-line Kf averaged 27 +/- 10 and 20 +/- 4 (SD) microliter.min-1.cmH2O-1.g dry wt-1 for endotoxin and oleic acid groups, respectively. It was unchanged in the endotoxin group throughout the experiment but approximately doubled in the oleic acid lungs. Pulmonary arterial and venous pressures were not changed significantly during the course of these experiments in either group. Lung wet-to-dry weight ratios of these lungs were 5.6 +/- 0.6 and 6.1 +/- 0.5 ml/g for the endotoxin and oleic acid groups, respectively. This compares with 4.6 +/- 0.5 ml/g for normal, freshly excised but not perfused goat lungs. The small change in lung water and unchanged pulmonary pressures after both endotoxin and oleic acid suggest that lung injury was minimal. We conclude that 1) endotoxin does not cause a direct injury to the endothelium of isolated lungs during the first 5 h of perfusion, and 2) neutrophils are not sufficient to cause increased Kf after endotoxin infusion in this preparation.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed to determine whether rat pulmonary surfactant disaturated phosphatidylcholines (DSPC) are degraded by alveolar macrophages in vitro. When [3H]choline-labeled surfactant materials are incubated with unlabeled alveolar macrophages, approximately 40% of the labeled DSPC is broken down in 6 h. There is just a slight decrease in the specific activity of DSPC, which suggests that most products of degradation are not reincorporated into DSPC, at least during the 6-h incubation period. There is a time- and temperature-dependent association of surfactant DSPC with alveolar macrophages, and some of the cell-associated materials are released from the cell fragments after sonication. Association of surfactant with the cells precedes degradation. The breakdown of surfactant DSPC by intact alveolar macrophages lags behind that produced by sonicated cell preparations with disrupted cell membranes. These data and other information suggest that the surfactant materials are internalized by the cells, before the breakdown. The products of degradation probably include free choline and fatty acids, most of which appear in the extracellular fluid. The breakdown processes do not seem to depend on the physical form of the surfactant or on the presence of surfactant apoproteins. Incubation of the cells alone also results in disappearance of intracellular DSPC, some of which may be surfactant phospholipid taken up by the cells in vivo. These results indicate that alveolar macrophages can degrade surfactant DSPC and suggest that these cells may be involved in catabolism of pulmonary surfactant materials.\r"

Static capacity was 126 +/- 14.6 cmH2O at FRC, remained unchanged between 30 and 55% TLC, and decreased to 40 +/- 6.8 cmH2O at TLC. Dynamic capacity declined by a further 5.0 +/- 0.35% from the static pressure at any given lung volume for every liter per second increase in inspiratory flow. The subjects underwent progressive incremental exercise to maximum power and achieved 1,800 +/- 45 kpm/min and maximum O2 uptake of 3,518 +/- 222 ml/min. During exercise peak esophageal pressure increased from 9.4 +/- 1.81 to 38.2 +/- 5.70 cmH2O and end-inspiratory esophageal pressure increased from 7.8 +/- 0.52 to 22.5 +/- 2.03 cmH2O from rest to maximum exercise. Because the estimated capacity available to meet these demands is critically dependent on end-inspiratory lung volume, the changes in lung volume during exercise were measured in three of the subjects using He dilution.

Periodic breathing in these infants was defined by characteristic cycles of ventilation with intervening respiratory pauses greater than or equal to 2 s. Nasal airflow was recorded with a pneumotachometer, and esophageal or pharyngeal pressure was recorded with a fluid-filled catheter. Pulmonary resistance at half-maximal tidal volume, inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) were derived from computer analysis of five cycles of periodic breathing per infant. In 80% of infants periodic breathing was accompanied by completely obstructed breaths at the onset of ventilatory cycles; the site of airway obstruction occurred within the pharynx. The first one-third of the ventilatory phase of each cycle was accompanied by the highest airway resistance of the entire cycle (168 +/- 98 cmH2O.l-1.s). In all infants TI was greatest at the onset of the ventilatory cycle, VT/TI was maximal at the midpoint of the cycle, and TE was longest in the latter two-thirds of each cycle. A characteristic increase and subsequent decrease of 4.5 +/- 1.9 ml in end-expiratory volume also occurred within each cycle. These results demonstrate that partial or complete airway obstruction occurs during periodic breathing. Both apnea and periodic breathing share the element of upper airway instability common to premature infants.\r"

Although a less potent agonist, adding HIS to cause 50% of the TT reduced the concentration of ACh to elicit the remaining 50% TT and substantially altered relaxation by ISO compared with HIS alone [concentration required to achieve 50% relaxation (RC50) = 9.2 +/- 2.4 X 10(-8) vs. 9.0 +/- 4.4 X 10(-9) M to HIS alone; P less than 0.003]. Relaxation for TSM strips contracted with ACh + HIS was comparable to that elicited from the same TT with ACh alone, although concentrations required in combination were lower than for either agonist alone. Trachealis strips contracted equivalently with KCl + HIS also had augmented contraction and attenuated relaxation (RC50 = 3.7 +/- 0.8 X 10(-8) M; P less than 0.015 vs. HIS alone). However, combinations of 5-HT + ACh and 5-HT + HIS did not alter relaxation to ISO from that elicited by the weaker agonist alone. We demonstrate that TSM relaxation depends on the combination of agonists eliciting contraction and may be inhibited substantially by interactions among contractile agonists.\r"

We therefore used multiple indicator-dilution methods and higher substrate concentrations to apply a mathematical model, based on saturable kinetics that yield independent estimates of the apparent kinetic parameters Vmax and Km for pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). We used the ACE substrate, [3H]benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline ([3H]BPAP) and made these measurements and also estimates of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] removal, before and after acute lung injury induced by intratracheal administration of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).

Fluid filtration rates (FFR's, the change in lung weight/time) in response to a 7.5-min zone 3 hydrostatic stress (pulmonary arterial and venous pressures raised from 8 to 15 cmH2O, alveolar pressure kept constant at 4 cm on the deflation limb) were repeatedly measured for 120 min after which the lungs were lavaged. The total protein concentration was measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALP). Lactate production was measured to verify inhibition of glycolysis. Lower concentrations of IAA and alpha-MG eliminated lactate production but did not affect FFR or BALP. NaF also had no effect on the FFR or BALP. Only high concentrations of IAA increased FFR and BALP, seemingly by causing nonspecific membrane injury that was unrelated to its specific effects on glycolysis.

Pilocarpine was used as a selective agonist and gallamine as a selective antagonist of these autoreceptors. Acetylcholine (ACh) release from postganglionic cholinergic nerves was elicited by electrical field stimulation (EFS) (40 V, 0.5 ms, 32 Hz). In human bronchi, pilocarpine inhibited the contractile response to EFS in a dose-related fashion; the dose inhibiting 50% of the control contraction was 2.2 +/- 0.4 x 10(-7) (SE) M (n = 22), and the inhibition was 96% at 3 x 10(-5) M. The inhibitory effects of pilocarpine were antagonized by gallamine in a dose-related fashion. The results were qualitatively the same in the guinea pig. Gallamine significantly enhanced the contractile response to EFS in the guinea pig, whereas pirenzepine failed to do so, which suggests that M2-receptors are involved. We conclude that prejunctional muscarinic receptors that inhibit ACh release are present on cholinergic nerves in human airways and that guinea pig trachea is a good model for further pharmacological characterization of these receptors, which appear to belong to the M2-subtype.\r"

These results suggest that the late decrease in ventilation during hypoxia in the newborn kitten is not central but is due to a peripheral mechanism located in the lungs or respiratory pump and affecting tidal volume primarily. We speculate that either pulmonary bronchoconstriction or mechanical uncoupling of diaphragm and chest wall may be involved.\r"

To eliminate some of the variance due to individual differences in body surface area, we utilized a new approach based on the calculation of the percentages of each individual's normal predicted values (%NPV). We studied 46 strength (S, bodybuilders) and 57 endurance (E, runners) athletes. Left ventricular (LV) mass was 143.8 +/- 21.9 %NPV (mean +/- SD) in E vs. 134.3 +/- 23.4 %NPV in S (P less than 0.05), and LV volume was 131.0 +/- 24.0 %NPV in E vs. 120.0 +/- 25.5 %NPV in S (P less than 0.05). Moreover, the LV wall thickness-to-radius ratio did not differ from normal values in either group. From these data we conclude that 1) cardiac modifications are greater in E than S, 2) the predominant stimulus is a volume overload type in both groups, and 3) concentric LV hypertrophy may not be as prevalent in S as previously suggested.\r"

In isolated perfused lungs of nine dogs, blood flow was stopped at different vascular pressures. By means of a double-micropuncture technique under stereomicroscopy, an oil drop was injected in a subpleural venule. The oil drop was then split with a solution of albumin (5.6 g/100 ml) in Ringer lactate. As the Ringer-albumin solution filtered, the distance between the menisci of the split oil drop (split-drop length) decreased. The split-drop geometry and the rate of change of split-drop length were recorded. The calculated venular filtration rate per unit surface area related linearly with vascular pressure (P less than 0.05). The slope of the line equaled venular hydraulic conductivity, which averaged 2.9 +/- 0.02 x 10(-7) ml/(cm2.s.cmH2O). Hydraulic conductivity is lower in lung than in systemic venules.\r"

By the use of a cast of the upper respiratory tract and oscillating flows with a Reynolds number of 500 and nondimensional frequency of 1.6, corresponding to quiet tidal breathing through the nose, dye dilution measurements indicated an efficiency of tidal exchange of 0.95. Flow visualization studies performed to trace the expiratory flow, as well as the streamlines during steady inspiratory flow, support the hypothesis that the high efficiency of exchange is due to radical differences in the velocity fields between inspiratory and expiratory phases of this oscillatory flow. These findings confirm that convective gas exchange between the nose and the atmosphere is highly efficient; however, the underlying mechanism responsible for this exchange also maximizes the exposure of the respiratory system to aerosols contained in the ambient atmosphere.\r"

Studies were performed in unanesthetized rats (n = 6) exposed to 46 degrees C and in chloralose-anesthetized animals (n = 11) at 40 degrees C. Core (Tc) and tail-skin temperatures, heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were also monitored. In both groups, prolonged (70-150 min) exposure progressively elevated Tc from 37.0 to 44.0 degrees C. MAP rose to a plateau then fell precipitously as Tc exceeded 41.5 degrees C. SMA resistance increased throughout the early stages of heating, with a sharp decline from this elevated level 10-15 min before the precipitous fall in MAP. ECA resistance fell initially but increased in the terminal stage of heating. In unanesthetized animals, LIA resistance progressively declined. In chloralose-anesthetized animals LRA resistance rose progressively, then increased markedly as Tc exceeded 41.5 degrees C. These data support the hypothesis that a selective loss of compensatory splanchnic vasoconstriction may trigger the cascade of events that characterize heat stroke. This differential vascular response was similar in both unanesthetized and anesthetized animals.\r"

Maximal exercise stress was defined as an exercise intensity greater than or equal to that necessary to produce maximal levels of O2 consumption (VO2max). Coronary blood flows (CBF) were determined with the use of the microsphere technique in chronically instrumented conscious miniature swine during +Gz stress and exercise stress at 70 and 100% of maximal tolerance (for each stress) before and after maximal coronary vasodilation with 1-2 mg/kg dipyridamole. CBFR was measured as the amount of blood flow increase produced by maximal coronary vasodilation. During exercise at VO2max, dipyridamole produced 20-30% increases in CBF, whereas it induced no coronary vasodilation or changes in CBF during +Gz stress. Dipyridamole also produced decreases in the animals' tolerance to +Gz in that all five animals could maintain a steady state for 60 s at 7 +Gz before dipyridamole, whereas only two of these animals could maintain a steady state for 60 s at 7 +Gz after dipyridamole. These results confirm that CBFR exists during maximal exercise in normal mammals. However, this dose of dipyridamole produced no coronary vasodilation during either level of +Gz stress.\r"

We measured flow, volume, airway pressure, and surface diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) in 10 healthy preterm infants [33 +/- 1 (SD) wk gestation], 2-7 days of age. Three resistive and two elastic loads and occlusions were applied to the inspiratory outlet of a two-way respiratory valve. Application of all loads resulted in inspired volumes significantly decreased from control (P less than 0.001), and these decreases were progressive with increasing loads. Inspiratory duration (TI) was prolonged from control by all loads and occlusions when measured from the diaphragmatic EMG (neural TI) and by all but the smaller elastic load when measured from the flow tracing (mechanical TI). Similar decreases in inspired volume at the end of neural TI produced by application of both elastic and resistive loads resulted in comparable prolongation of neural TI. In contrast, for comparable volume decrements, resistive loading prolonged mechanical TI more than elastic loading (P less than 0.001). Mechanical and neural TI values of the breath after the loaded breath were unchanged from control values. Comparison of the neural volume-timing relationship in premature infants with our data in full-term infants suggests that the strength of the timing response to similar relative decrements in inspired volume is comparable. We conclude that reflex control of neural TI in premature infants depends on the magnitude of inspired volume and is independent of the volume trajectory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Am. Med. Assoc. 256: 63-69, 1986). We hypothesized that acute mountain sickness (AMS) in which gas exchange is impaired to a milder degree is a precursor to HAPE. We therefore performed BAL with 0.89% NaCl by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in eight subjects at 4,400 m (barometric pressure = 440 Torr) on Mt. McKinley to evaluate the cellular and biochemical responses of the lung at high altitude. The subjects included one healthy control (arterial O2 saturation = 83%), three climbers with HAPE (mean arterial O2 saturation = 55.0 +/- 5.0%), and four with AMS (arterial O2 saturation = 70.0 +/- 2.4%). Cell counts and differentials were done immediately on the BAL fluid, and the remainder was frozen for protein and biochemical analysis to be performed later. The results of this and of the earlier study mentioned above showed that the total leukocyte count (X10(5)/ml) in BAL fluid was 3.5 +/- 2.0 for HAPE, 0.9 +/- 4.0 for AMS, and 0.7 +/- 0.6 for controls, with predominantly alveolar macrophages in HAPE. The total protein concentration (mg/dl) was 616.0 +/- 3.3 for HAPE, 10.4 +/- 8.3 for AMS, and 12.0 +/- 3.4 for controls, with both large- (immunoglobulin M) and small- (albumin) molecular-weight proteins present in HAPE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An analysis (method of moments) developed for addressing dispersion in porous media was used to derive an integral expression for the axial dispersion coefficient (D*). Evaluation of D* required solving the Navier-Stokes equations for the flow field and a convection-diffusion type equation arising from the analysis. D* was strongly dependent on alveolar volume per central duct volume, the aperture size through which the alveoli communicate with the central duct, and the Peclet number (Pe). At smaller Pe (flow rate) D* was substantially smaller than the molecular diffusion coefficient, whereas at larger Pe (flow rate) D* was much greater than the Taylor-Aris result for flow-enhanced dispersion in straight tubes. Also, flow-enhanced dispersion became appreciable at smaller Pe than indicated by the Taylor-Aris result. These behaviors transcend both the lower and upper limits established previously for gas mixing in the pulmonary acinus.\r"

Seven subjects reached their blood lactate threshold (LT) during exercise of a relatively low intensity (group L) (i.e., 65.8 +/- 1.7% VO2 max), whereas exercise of a relatively high intensity was required to elicit LT in the other seven men (group H) (i.e., 81.5 +/- 1.8% VO2 max; P less than 0.001). Time to fatigue during exercise at 88% of VO2 max was more than twofold longer in group H compared with group L (60.8 +/- 3.1 vs. 29.1 +/- 5.0 min; P less than 0.001). Over 92% of the variance in performance was related to the % VO2 max at LT and muscle capillary density. The vastus lateralis muscle of group L was stressed more than that of group H during submaximal cycling (i.e., 79% VO2 max), as reflected by more than a twofold greater (P less than 0.001) rate of glycogen utilization and blood lactate concentration. The quality of the vastus lateralis in groups H and L was similar regarding mitochondrial enzyme activity, whereas group H possessed a greater percentage of type I muscle fibers (66.7 +/- 5.2 vs. 46.9 +/- 3.8; P less than 0.01). The differing metabolic responses to submaximal exercise observed between the two groups appeared to be specific to the leg extension phase of cycling, since the blood lactate responses of the two groups were comparable during uphill running. These data indicate that endurance can vary greatly among individuals with an equal VO2 max.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This allowed measurement of the intrinsic resistance (Rw,min) and overall dynamic inspiratory impedance (Rw,max), which includes the additional pressure losses due to time constant inequalities within the chest wall tissues and/or stress adaptation. These results, together with our previous data pertaining to the lung (Kochi et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 64: 441-450, 1988), allowed us to determine Rmin and Rmax of the total respiratory system (rs). We observed that 1) Rw,max and Rrs,max exhibited marked frequency dependence; 2) Rw,min was independent of flow (V) and inspired volume (delta V), whereas Rrs,min increased linearly with V and decreased with increasing delta V; 3) Rw,max decreased with increasing V, whereas Rrs,max exhibited a minimum value at a flow rate substantially higher than the resting range of V; 4) both Rw,max and Rrs,max increased with increasing delta V. We conclude that during resting breathing, flow resistance of the chest wall and total respiratory system, as conventionally measured, includes a significant component reflecting time constant inequalities and/or stress adaptation phenomena.\r"

In 23 unanesthetized, instrumented sheep with long-term lung lymph fistulas, we assessed the effect of the beta-agonist terbutaline or the beta-antagonists propranolol, nadolol, and atenolol, all infused intravenously, on lung lymph flow under base-line conditions and during the acute lung injury caused by 4 h of venous air embolism. Under base-line conditions, neither beta-stimulation nor blockade had any effect. During air embolism, terbutaline decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and lymph flow by 25%. Propranolol and nadolol (non-selective beta 1,beta 2-antagonists) but not atenolol (selective beta 1-antagonist) also decreased lymph flow by 22% on average. We favor the more conservative (hemodynamic) over the more liberal (altered permeability) explanation for our results. First, beta-stimulation clearly caused vasodilation, which lowered the pulmonary microvascular pressure at the site of injury. beta-blockade caused changes similar to alpha-stimulation (J. Appl. Physiol. 62: 2147-2153, 1987). We therefore interpret the beta-blockade as unmasking pulmonary arterial alpha-receptors stimulated by the air-embolism injury, thus allowing vasoconstriction upstream to the site of injury. We do not believe the explanation of the beta-agent effects requires any modulation of lung microvascular leakiness by beta-adrenergic agents.\r"

The SMA and DMD groups produced equal tidal volume, respiratory frequency, inspiratory duration (TI), expiratory duration, mean inspiratory airflow, and duty cycle responses to both delta E and delta R. Thus SMA (primarily a motoneuron disorder) and DMD (primarily a muscle disorder) have the same net effect on loaded breathing responses. The SMA and DMD groups failed to duplicate the normal group's short expirations during delta E, long inspirations during delta R, and thus, extended duty cycles during both delta E and delta R. The deficit in load compensation therefore was due to impaired regulation of respiratory timing (reflecting neural mechanisms) but not airflow defense (reflecting mechanical and neural mechanisms). One-fifth of the normal but none of the SMA or DMD subjects actively generated an \"optimal\" TI response (defined theoretically as TI greater than 160% control during large delta R and TI less than 75% control during large delta E). This lack of optimal responses, which is the same abnormality exhibited by quadriplegic people, suggests that SMA and DMD also impair human ability to discriminate between large delta R and delta E. These findings support the hypothesis that neuromuscular disorders can lead to disturbances in respiratory perception.\r"

Pulmonary mechanics and plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured before, at end exercise, and serially after each challenge. There were no differences in the pattern of sympathoadrenal response of asthmatic and normal subjects, and both groups released sufficient quantities of epinephrine and norepinephrine into the peripheral circulation to allow these compounds to function as circulating hormones. As the catecholamines rose with repetitive exercise, progressive bronchodilation occurred in the asthmatics at the end of the work load, thus decreasing the apparent magnitude of the obstructive response. In addition to their effects on airway smooth muscle, the alpha-adrenergic actions of both catecholamines may have reduced airway wall hyperemia and edema. These data demonstrate that asthmatics do not have a defect in catecholamine release during exercise and that the physiological expression of exercise-induced asthma can be modulated by the sympathoadrenal epiphenomena that are associated with physical exertion.\r"

Five sheep were prepared with lung lymph fistulas and instrumented to measure pulmonary arterial and left atrial pressures. Multiple indicator-dilution curves (with 125I-labeled albumin, 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes, [14C]urea, and 3H2O) were measured at base line and during phases 1 and 2 of the endotoxin response. Alterations in the membrane integrity in response to endotoxin infusion were quantified by using a two-pore theory of the microvascular barrier that incorporated lymph, protein, pressure, and multiple indicator measurements. The modeling results showed a slight change in the size of the pores during phase 1 but a 56% decrease in the number of small pores and a twofold increase in the number of large pores with respect to base-line values. During phase 2 the large pore size increased by 40%, and the total number of pores returned to base-line values. The analysis showed that endotoxin effects on fluid and protein exchange in the lung cannot be explained by hemodynamic and surface area changes alone. An apparent increase in lung microvascular permeability occurs during phases 1 and 2 of the endotoxin reaction, with a substantial decrease in perfused microvascular surface area during phase 1.\r"

At base line the compensated NADH fluorescence (F0) was not significantly different between EDL and SOL. In EDL, tetanic stimulation induced an increase of F0, which rapidly reached a plateau that was 124% over the base-line value and stable until the end of the stimulation. In SOL, after an initial shouldering there was a continuous increase of F0 until the end of tetanus, reaching 275% of the base-line value. After the stimulation the initial rate of recovery was significantly faster in SOL than in EDL. We conclude that during and after intense contraction the variation of NADH content vs. time can be evaluated by in situ NADH laser fluorimetry in different muscle types. This nondestructive method can be helpful to differentiate in situ the various physiological or pathological oxidative capabilities of skeletal muscles.\r"

One arm performed 70 maximal contractions (70-MAX condition), and the other arm performed 24 maximal contractions (24-MAX) followed 2 wk later by 70 maximal contractions (70-MAX2). Criterion measures of serum creatine kinase, muscle soreness and pain, isometric strength, and muscle shortening were assessed before, immediately after, and for 5 days after each exercise. Significant changes in all criterion measures were found after the 70-MAX exercise with a slow recovery that was not complete by day 5 after exercise. The 24-MAX condition showed only small changes in the criterion measures. Changes in the criterion measures after the 70-MAX2 exercise were significantly smaller than those after the 70-MAX exercise. Results from this study, with regard to the ability of the muscle to adapt to exercise-induced damage, suggest that an adaptation takes place such that the muscle is more resistant to damage and any damage that does occur is repaired at a faster rate. It is also clear that a relatively small insult will produce this adaptation.\r"

Despite large differences in maximal 02 consumption (VO2max), the older athletes and their sedentary peers had similar values for all pulmonary variables when expressed as absolute values. However, because the older athletes were shorter than the older sedentary men, their vital capacity, total lung capacity (TLC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were significantly larger than those of the older sedentary men when normalized for age and height; the average values for maximal voluntary ventilation and residual volume (RV) were also larger in the older athletes when normalized for age and height, but the differences were not significant. The young trained and untrained men did not differ in any of these measures. TLC was the only pulmonary variable that was the same in the young and older men; RV and the RV-to-TLC ratio were larger, whereas all other pulmonary function and volume measures were lower in the older men compared with the younger men. The older athletes were the only group whose lung volumes and pulmonary function measures were all, except for RV, substantially greater than expected based on their age and height. Thus prolonged strenuous endurance training in these older highly trained endurance athletes appears to have altered the decline in pulmonary function and volumes associated with aging.\r"

Both pretriathlon plasma LPS and anti-LPS IgG levels were directly related to the intensity of training (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.01, respectively).

The effects on athletic performance in relation to exercise-induced changes in plasma LPS and anti-LPS IgG levels require further investigation.\r"

BP and blood gases remained unchanged between the two groups. R resulted in increased arterial lactate concentrations compared with C and SW at base line but was not different from SW at 4 wk. SW elicited higher plasma levels of NE and EPI compared with C at base line and C and R at 4 wk. Myocardial tissue NE and EPI concentrations were markedly increased in both the left and right ventricle of the SW group compared with both R and C.

In control experiments the transepithelial mucosal-to-serosal and serosal-to-mucosal fluxes (Jm----s and Js----m) were constant over the experimental period. When the epithelium was at right angles to the applied electromagnetic field, the Jm----s flux of Na+ was reduced, whereas Js----m was enhanced. When the epithelium was rotated 180 degrees, Jm----s was enhanced, whereas Js----m was reduced. When the epithelium was mounted parallel to the magnetic field, both Jm----s and Js----m of Na+ were increased, the latter continuing to increase after the field was turned off. When the tissue was rotated 180 degrees, the same enhanced flux was observed, but now the Jm----s flux showed the greatest increase, which again occurred in the period after the field was turned off. The rate of decrease of transepithelial potential difference in all orientations was less than the control. Also, the conductance increased in orientations 2-4 and decreased in orientation 1 after the field had been applied. This suggests that pulsed electromagnetic fields can have a direct effect on the movement of Na+ across tissue and transepithelial potentials. The mechanism may depend on several factors, such as induced changes in certain ion pumps, the membrane potential, and the surface charge of cell wall proteins.\r"

Cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion of anesthetized dogs was used to isolate reflexes. The following three groups were prepared: 1) lung vessels pressurized by pumping into the main pulmonary artery (MPA); 2) lungs and fibrillating LH pressurized by pumping into MPA while draining from LH; 3) lungs congested by occluding several pulmonary veins while holding cardiac output constant. Congestion of lungs alone in groups 1 and 3 depressed fr. Congestion of lungs and distension of LH (group 2) caused transient depression of fr but a steady-state excitation. Cooling cervical vagi to 8 degrees C prevented depression of fr by congestion in all groups. In groups 1 and 2, in which MPA pressure was higher than in group 3, congestion during vagal cooling stimulated breathing. I conclude that lung congestion may stimulate fr via C-fiber afferents, but this may be overcome by a depressor effect via myelinated afferents. Simultaneous LH distension may reflexly stimulate breathing and overcome the lung depressor reflex.\r"

These methods represent an improvement over previous models in that 1) the effects of changing lung volume and of parenchymal-bronchial interdependence are simulated; 2) a more realistic representation of collapsed airways is employed; 3) a solution is obtained mouthward of the flow-limiting site by allowing for a smooth transition from sub- to supercritical flow speeds, then matching mouth pressure by imposing an elastic jump (an abrupt transition from super- to subcritical flow speeds) at the appropriate location; and 4) the effects of levels of effort (or vacuum pressure) in excess of those required to produce incipient flow limitation are examined, including the effects of potential physiological limitation.\r"

Mixing coefficients (Deff) were determined from the dispersion of a CO2 bolus centered at the bifurcation point, and pendelluft volume was computed as a fraction of mother branch tidal volume (PVF) using measurements of airflow in the daughter branches. Plotted against frequency, PVF was a bell-shaped curve insensitive to the value of VOp. When VR = 2, a PVF peak of 0.25 appeared at f = 3 Hz, and when VR = 5, a PVF peak of 0.75 appeared at f = 4 Hz. After normalization by control values at VR = 1, Deff curves were also bell shaped, insensitive to the value of VOp and with peaks appearing at the same frequencies as the PVF peaks. The normalized Deff peak values were 1.7 when VR = 2 and 4.0 when VR = 5. The similarities in the PVF and Deff curves imply a direct relationship between pendelluft and enhanced mixing.\r"

Unexpectedly, fever always developed, rising to heights not significantly different at any time before parturition [4-8 days prepartum = 0.81 +/- 0.23 degree C (SE); 1-3 days prepartum = 0.75 +/- 0.17 degree C) and similar to those in three wethers treated similarly (0.90 +/- 0.10 degree C). Generally, during rising fever, blood flow in the ewes shifted away from heat loss tissues (e.g., skin, nose) to heat production tissues (e.g., shivering muscle, fat) and cardiac output increased; blood flow through redistribution organs (e.g., splanchnic bed) decreased. The reverse occurred during defervescence. Utero-placental blood flow remained high in the febrile ewes. These regional blood flow distributions during febrigenesis and lysis are essentially the same as those during exposures to ambient cold and heat, respectively. Some differences in the responses of cardiac output and its redistribution, however, were apparent between wethers and pregnant ewes. We conclude that 1) the previously reported \"absence of fever in the full-term-pregnant sheep\" should not be regarded as a general phenomenon and 2) full-term-pregnant sheep support fever production without sacrificing placental blood flow.\r"

A multiple logistic regression analysis provided an estimate of the probability of apnea during HFV as a function of four respiratory variables: mean airway pressure (Paw), tidal volume (VT), frequency, and arterial PCO2 (PaCO2). When mean Paw was 2 cmH2O, PaCO2, VT, and their interaction contributed significantly to the probability of apnea during HFV. At a low value of PaCO2 (25 Torr), the probability of apnea had a minimum value of 0.19 and gradually increased toward 1.0 as VT increased from 0.5 to 7 ml/kg. At higher levels of PaCO2 (30 and 35 Torr) the probability of apnea was zero in the low range of VT but sharply approached 1.0 above a VT of approximately 2.0 ml/kg. However, when Paw was increased to 6 cmH2O, only PaCO2 was an important determinant of apnea. In this case, the probability of apnea was 0.51 when PaCO2 was 25 Torr but decreased to 0.22 when PaCO2 was raised to 25 Torr. At neither Paw was the probability of apnea dependent on frequency. These results suggest that chemoreceptor inputs, in addition to both static and dynamic lung mechanoreceptor afferents, are responsible for determining the output of the central respiratory centers during HFV.\r"

Four groups were studied: sedentary control, trained control, sedentary diabetic, and trained diabetic. Trained control and diabetic rats were exercised on a treadmill at 5% grade, 21 m/min, 90 min/day, 6 days/wk for 8 wk. Sedentary diabetics had significantly lower body weight and elevated plasma glucose, triacylglycerol, and cholesterol relative to both control groups. Hearts from this group exhibited depressed postischemic recovery of pump function during reperfusion. In contrast, trained diabetic rats exhibited significantly lower plasma levels of triacylglycerol and cholesterol relative to sedentary diabetics. The postischemic recovery of cardiac pump function was improved in hearts from trained diabetic rats relative to sedentary diabetics. Exercise training had no effect on control rats. These results suggest that exercise training produces an antihyperlipidemic effect in diabetic rats and improves the tolerance of the diabetic heart to ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Because alveolar hypoxia has been shown to cause an increase of leukotrienes in lung lavage fluid, we tested the hypothesis that enhancement of nonspecific bronchial reactivity during alveolar hypoxia may be mediated by leukotrienes. In nine conscious sheep we determined specific lung resistance (sRL) before and after exposure to either air or a hypoxic gas mixture (13% O2) for 30 min. The sheep then inhaled 50 breaths of aerosolized 5% histamine solution (n = 6) or 10 breaths of 2.5% carbachol solution (n = 6) on different days, and the measurements of sRL were repeated. On subsequent days the above protocols were repeated after pretreatment with aerosolized FPL 57231 (3 ml, 1% solution), a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Inhalation of histamine and carbachol after exposure to air caused an increase in mean sRL to 337 and 342% of base line, respectively (P less than 0.05). Exposure to the hypoxic gas mixture had no effect on sRL but enhanced the histamine- and carbachol-induced increases in mean sRL to 621 and 646% of base line, respectively (P less than 0.05); these increases were significantly higher than those observed after air exposure (P less than 0.05). FPL 57231 prevented the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity to histamine and carbachol without affecting the airway responsiveness to these agents after air. In another group of eight sheep, aerosolized leukotriene C4, at a dose (50 micrograms) that per se had no affect on sRL, enhanced the bronchial reactivity to carbachol. These data suggest that in sheep during alveolar hypoxia airway hyperresponsiveness may be due to the priming of airway smooth muscle by leukotrienes.\r"

The period of TE during which the diaphragm was electrically active (TE-1) and the period of TE during which the diaphragm was quiescent (TE-2) were both increased with continuous UAW NP (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05, respectively), as was TE-1 as a percent of TE (P less than 0.001). Continuous UAW NP reduced peak triangularis sterni EMG (P less than 0.001) and delayed its expiratory onset (P less than 0.005) but did not alter its duration of firing. Changes in triangularis sterni EMG were due to a combination of complete cessation of motor unit activity (2 of 17 motor units), a reduction in mean motor unit firing frequency (P less than 0.02), and a delay in the expiratory onset of motor unit activity (P less than 0.001). Qualitatively similar results were obtained when UAW NP was applied during inspiration only. We conclude that 1) UAW NP has reciprocal stimulatory and inhibitory influences on diaphragm and triangularis sterni muscle electrical activity, respectively, during expiration, and 2) the reductions in triangularis sterni EMG are due to both motor unit derecruitment and a slowing of motor unit firing frequency.\r"

ACE activity was measured by spectrophotometric assay, and active sites of ACE were estimated by measuring the binding of 125I-351A [N-(1-carbonyl-3-phenyl-propyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline], a highly specific active site-directed inhibitor of ACE, to tissue homogenates and perfused lungs. Hypoxia exposure produced progressive reductions in ACE activity in lung homogenates and in ACE inhibitor binding to perfused lungs. ANG II levels in lungs from hypoxia-adapted animals were significantly less than air controls, suggesting that the reduction in intrapulmonary ACE activity was associated with reduced local generation of ANG II. ACE activity was increased in kidney and unchanged in brain and testis of hypoxia-adapted rats compared with air controls. Thus the effects of chronic hypoxia on catalytically active ACE and ACE active sites in the intact animal were organ specific. Adaptation to chronic hypoxia did not significantly alter plasma renin activity or ANG I or ANG II levels or serum ACE content. The hypoxia-induced alterations in lung and kidney ACE were reversible after return to a normoxic environment.\r"

Neutropenia induced by nitrogen mustard (17 +/- 14 greater than neutrophils/microliters) did not prevent RPE, because reexpanded lungs from six neutropenic rabbits were edematous (wet-to-dry lung weight ratio 6.34 +/- 0.43) compared with their contralateral lungs (4.97 +/- 0.04, P less than 0.01). An elevated albumin concentration in reexpanded lung lavage from neutropenic rabbits (8-fold) confirmed an increase in permeability. Neutrophil depletion before reexpansion did not prevent unilateral edema, although neutrophils were absent from lung sections and alveolar lavage fluid from neutropenic rabbits.\r"

Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC, 10(-3) M), a histidine-blocking agent, infused into the cisterna magna decreased the CSF HCO3- response to hypercapnia by 25.3% (mean delta CSF [HCO3-]/delta PaCO2, 0.230 vs. 0.308 mmol.l-1.Torr-1, P less than 0.02). DEPC is known to inhibit the ventilatory response to hypercapnia (E. Nattie. Respir. Physiol. 64: 161-176, 1986) by a direct effect at the ventrolateral medulla (E. Nattie. J. Appl. Physiol. 61: 843-850, 1986). In this study amiloride had no significant effect on the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. The interpretation is that a Na+-H+ countertransport protein, perhaps with a histidine at a key location, is involved in CSF acid-base regulation and that amiloride appears to have no effects on the chemoreception process. DEPC appears to have effects on chemoreception and on CSF acid-base regulation.\r"

Female 21-day-old rats were assigned to one of four groups, two dietary groups (50 and 6 ppm dietary iron) subdivided into two levels of activity (sedentary and treadmill trained). Iron deficiency decreased hemoglobin (61%), maximal O2 uptake. (VO2max) (40%), skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidase activities (59-90%), and running endurance (94%). In contrast, activities of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes in skeletal muscle were largely unaffected. Four weeks of mild training in iron-deficient rats resulted in improved blood lactate homeostasis during exercise and increased VO2max (15%), TCA cycle enzymes of skeletal muscle (27-58%) and heart (29%), and liver NADH oxidase (34%) but did not affect any of these parameters in the iron-sufficient animals. In iron-deficient rats training affected neither the blood hemoglobin level nor any measured iron-dependent enzyme pathway of skeletal muscle but substantially increased endurance (230%). We conclude that the training-induced increase in endurance in iron-deficient rats may be related to cardiovascular improvements, elevations in liver oxidative capacity, and increases in the activities of oxidative enzymes that do not contain iron in skeletal and cardiac muscle.\r"

Twenty-nine fetal lambs (approximately 138 days gestational age) were exteriorized. In 16 of these lambs, the umbilical cord was occluded for 4 min then released for 10 min. This asphyxial episode was repeated until the arterial pH was approximately 7.00, and the mean arterial blood pressure was less than 40 mmHg and falling. The 13 control lambs were simply exteriorized with the umbilical circulation intact. The lambs were then ventilated for 3-4 h. There were no differences between the control vs. asphyxiated lambs in pulmonary compliances (0.57 and 0.58 ml.cmH2O-1.kg-1) wet-to-dry weight ratios (8.18 and 7.55), cardiac outputs (177.8 and 141.8 ml.kg-1.min-1), surfactant-saturated phosphatidylcholine pool sizes, or atrial and/or ductal shunts. Asphyxia did not interfere with the redirection of blood away from atelectatic lung segments created by bronchial obstruction with balloon catheters. Also, although the bidirectional flux of protein into and out of the airways of these preterm lambs was large relative to term lambs, there was no effect of asphyxia on this protein leak. In this animal model, prenatal asphyxia did not impact negatively on the severity of the respiratory failure.\r"

The technique was based on the notion that the uptake of dimethyl ether (VDME) from an isolated tracheal segment is governed by VH2O (transient state) and Qtr (steady state). In lightly anesthetized sheep, an endotracheal tube with two cuffs placed 14.5-16.5 cm apart was placed to create a chamber into which dimethyl ether was introduced and from which VDMME into the mucosa was determined with a sensitive pneumotachograph. Mean Qtr was 1.20 ml/min (range 0.87-1.73), and mean VH2O was 1.67 ml (range 1.27-2.26). Qtr correlated with cardiac output but not with body weight or tracheal mucosal surface area determined by He dilution. VH2O did not show a correlation with any of these parameters. The response to selected pharmacological agents suggested that the measurements of Qtr and VH2O are independent of each other and from changes in tracheal diameter. Mean Qtr was 80% of mean tracheal mucosal blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. We concluded that the inert soluble gas method is capable of measuring in vivo the perfusion and a water compartment of the intact tracheal mucosa.\r"

Using micropipettes and a servonulling device, we measured pressures in 20-60-micron-diam subpleural arterioles and venules during control and hypoxic conditions. We inflated the lungs to a constant airway pressure of 5-7 cmH2O and kept left atrial pressure greater than airway pressure (zone 3) during micropuncture. In eight lungs we measured microvascular pressures first during control and then during hypoxia. We reversed this order in four lungs. In seven lungs we measured microvascular pressures only during hypoxia. We found a significant increase in pulmonary arterial pressure with no change in microvascular pressures. These results indicate that the site of hypoxic vasoconstriction in lungs of newborn rabbits is arteries greater than 60 micron in diameter.\r"

We analyzed changes in internal diameter (ID), flow velocity, and volume flow of embolized and nonembolized arteries simultaneously with ID changes of small veins. In embolized arteries, with 180-, 300-, and 500-microns beads, ID constricted maximally in just proximal portions of the plug by 22, 23, and 17%, respectively, but with 840-microns beads, no ID constriction occurred. With 50-microns beads, the maximum ID constriction occurred in arteries of 200-300 microns but not in those of 100-200 microns. The constriction decreased in the upstream larger arteries and disappeared in those greater than 800 microns ID. In the nonembolized arteries no ID change occurred. Veins constricted slightly compared with arteries. By heparin pretreatment, ID constriction was slightly attenuated in arteries and was almost abolished in veins, whereas it was not affected with hexamethonium bromide. At a branching site, volume flow to an embolized artery decreased because of a decrease in ID and flow velocity, whereas volume flow to a nonembolized artery increased because of an increase in flow velocity. We concluded that pulmonary microembolization induced a vasoconstriction chiefly in small pulmonary arteries upstream to the plug. After embolization, blood flow was locally redistributed from an embolized to a nonembolized artery at a branching site. Arterial vasoconstriction may be mediated chiefly by local mechanical factors.\r"

In a single circulation through an isolated rat lung, 69.3 +/- 3.3% of infused [14C]adenosine (10 microM) was removed from the circulation. Uptake of [14C]adenosine remained unchanged when deamination of adenosine was inhibited by 8-azaguanine or coformycin. In a single passage of adenosine through the pulmonary artery, very little of the deaminated products appeared in the pulmonary circulation, but when adenosine was recirculated through the pulmonary circulation inosine and hypoxanthine appeared in the venous effluent. These adenosine metabolites were also taken up by the lung. A major portion of the circulating adenosine was transported into the lung, where it was used to synthesize adenine nucleotides. Inhibition of adenosine kinase by iodotubercidin resulted in reduced formation of ATP and ADP. Uptake of adenosine by the lung was saturable on a concentration gradient and was a passive process because it was not affected by the absence of glucose or the presence of ouabain. Km and Vmax for adenosine transport were 0.227 mM and 4.6 mumol.min-1.g lung-1, respectively. Adenosine transport was inhibited by adenosine analogues, and the inhibitions were found to be competitive in nature. These results suggest that a specific and rate-limiting transport system exists in the lung for adenosine.\r"

Testing of RIP was carried out with a device incorporating a thermally compensated oscillator and digital demodulatory circuitry. This system, introduced to commerce in 1983, superceded the nonthermal compensated oscillatory and analog demodulator circuitry first used in 1977. Testing the effects of changing cross-sectional area was accomplished by stretching a standard RIP transducer band around wooden dowels placed in holes on a peg board grid to form 23 curved and 5 rectangular shapes. The output voltage from RIP was linear for both the curved and rectangular shapes for changes of cross-sectional area within a physiological range. However, the regression line of voltage vs. cross-sectional area for the rectangular shapes was parallel and slightly displaced from the regression line for the curved shapes due to mutual coupling of inductance in the corners. Base-line drift from a RIP transducer band stretched to enclose an elliptical shape was less than 2.5 mV over a 12-h observation period. Current RIP technology accurately reflects changes of cross-sectional area of physiological shapes and has a stable base line.\r"

In this study we examined the variability of breathing pattern both on a breath-to-breath and day-to-day basis by calculating the coefficient of variation (i.e., the standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the mean). By examining breath-to-breath data, we found that the coefficients of variation of tidal volume (VT) and fractional inspiratory time (TI/TT, an index of timing) obtained with an inductive plethysmograph and spirometer were within 1% of each other. Examination of breath-to-breath variability in breathing pattern over a 15-min period in 65 subjects revealed large coefficients of variation, indicating the need to base calculations on a relatively large number of breaths. Less breath-to-breath variability was observed in respiratory frequency [f, 20.8 +/- 11.5% (SD)] and TI/TT (17.9 +/- 6.5%) than in VT (33 +/- 14.9%) and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI, an index of drive; 31.6 +/- 12.6%; P less than 0.0001).

After dehydration, the subjects rested for 1 h in a thermoneutral environment (28 degrees C, less than 30% rh), after which time the changes in the body fluid compartments were assessed. We measured plasma volume, plasma osmolality, and [Na+], [K+], and [Cl-] in plasma, together with sweat and urine volumes and their ionic concentrations before and after dehydration. The change in the extracellular fluid space (delta ECF) was estimated from chloride distribution and the change in the intracellular fluid space (delta ICF) was calculated by subtracting delta ECF from delta TW. The decrease in the ICF space was correlated with the increase in plasma osmolality (r = -0.74, P less than 0.02). The increase in plasma osmolality was a function of the loss of free water (delta FW), estimated from the equation delta FW = delta TW - (loss of osmotically active substance in sweat and urine)/(control plasma osmolality) (r = -0.79, P less than 0.01). Free water loss, which is analogous to \"free water clearance\" in renal function, showed a strongly inverse correlation with [Na+] in sweat (r = -0.97, P less than 0.001).

In the base-line condition, starting with normal extra-alveolar water content, filtration rate decreased by about one-half over 1 h as edema liquid slowly accumulated. We repeated each experiment after inducing edema (up to 100% lung weight gain). The absolute values and time course of filtration in the edema condition did not differ from base-line, i.e., the edema did not affect the time course of filtration. To compute the maximal initial and maximal change in extra-alveolar perimicrovascular pressure that occurred over each 1-h filtration study, we first assumed that the reflection coefficient is 0 in the Starling equation, then calculated perimicrovascular pressure and filtration coefficient from two equations with two unknowns. The mean filtration coefficient in 10 lobes is 0.063 g/(min X cmH2O X 100 g wet wt), and the initial perimicrovascular pressure is 3.9 cmH2O, rising by 4-7 cmH2O at 1 h. Finally we tested low protein perfusates and found the filtration rate was higher. We calculated an overall reflection coefficient = 0.44, a decrease in the initial perimicrovascular pressure to 1.9 cmH2O and a slightly lower increase after 1 h of edema formation, 2.2-6.6 cmH2O.\r"

As an index of microvascular injury the pulmonary filtration coefficient (Kf) was obtained by sequential elevations of lobar vascular pressures.

Using the combined extra-alveolar vascular system, we determined when recruitment of filtration surface area occurred as we increased vascular pressure from 0 to 40 cmH2O. Based on an abrupt increase in filtration rate as vascular pressure approached the zone 1/3 boundary, we infer that a sudden recruitment of exchange surface area occurred at that point. Based on the slopes of the zone 1 and zone 3 filtration profiles, we conclude that extra-alveolar vascular segments contribute approximately 25% of total to filtration in the lung under zone 3 conditions, although the exact vessels filtering under zone 1 conditions have yet to be determined. Our analysis of the data supports the concept that there is a difference in the perimicrovascular pressure around alveolar and extra-alveolar vessels, which in part may account for the apparent high filtration fraction apportioned to extra-alveolar vessels.\r"

  ".W": "The rat hindlimb suspension model was used to ascertain the importance of ground reaction forces in maintaining bone and tendon homeostasis. Young female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either a suspended or a nonsuspended group. After 28 days, femur bones and patellar tendons were obtained for morphological and biochemical analyses. Prolonged suspension induced a significant change in the geometric configuration of the femur middiaphysis by increasing the minimum diameter (12%) without any significant alterations in cortical area, density, mineral, and collagen concentrations. Femur wet weight, length, DNA, and uronic acid concentrations of suspended animals were not significantly different from bones of nonsuspended rats. However, the collagen and proteoglycan concentrations in patellar tendons of suspended rats were 28% lower than the concentrations of matrix proteins in tissues obtained from nonsuspended animals. These data suggest that elimination of ground reaction forces induces alterations in tendon composition and femur diaphyseal shape by changing regional rates in bone remodeling and localized tendon strain. Therefore it appears that ground reaction forces are an important factor in the maintenance of cortical bone and patellar tendon homeostasis during weight-bearing conditions.\r"

Metabolic functions were assessed before, during, and after perfusion with 80 nM PMA (n = 11), or PMA plus 133 microM papaverine (n = 10) or PMA diluent (dimethyl sulfoxide, n = 11). Organ kinetic parameters (apparent Vmax, Km) were calculated by use of indicator-dilution techniques and by a mathematical model of whole-organ metabolism. PMA treatment resulted in a significant decline in Vmax for BPAP metabolism (from 52 +/- 4 to 30 +/- 4 nmol/s) and 5-HT removal (from 2.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.1 nmol/s). Km for BPAP was not significantly altered, whereas Km for 5-HT removal was higher after treatment (before treatment, 1.1 +/- 0.1 microM; after treatment, 2.3 +/- 0.6 microM). Coperfusion with papaverine, which attenuated the pressor response to PMA, abolished PMA-induced changes in Vmax for BPAP metabolism and in Km for 5-HT removal but left PMA-induced changes in Vmax for 5-HT removal intact. We conclude that PMA alters endothelial metabolic function by both hemodynamic and biochemical mechanisms that are independent of circulating blood cells. Pulmonary capacity for BPAP metabolism may largely reflect perfused surface area, and capacity for 5-HT removal may be more sensitive to frank endothelial cell dysfunction in this model.\r"

In some experiments the animals were also paralyzed and artificially ventilated. Sustained tetanic stimulation of SLN consistently caused an apneic response associated with the appearance of tonic CO2-dependent activity in the expiratory muscles and in ER neurons located in the caudal ventral respiratory group (VRG) and the Botzinger complex. Single shocks or brief tetani at the same stimulation intensities failed to evoke excitatory responses in the expiratory muscles and in the vast majority of ER neurons tested. At higher stimulation strengths, single shocks or short tetani elicited excitatory responses in the expiratory muscles (20- to 35-ms latency) and in the majority of ER neurons of the caudal VRG (7.5- to 15.5-ms latency). These responses were obtained only during the expiratory phase and proved to be CO2 independent. On the contrary, only inhibitory responses were evoked in the activity of Botzinger complex neurons. The observed tonic expiratory activity most likely represents a disinhibition phenomenon due to the suppression of inspiratory activity; activation of expiratory muscles at higher stimulation intensities appears to be a polysynaptic reflex mediated by ER neurons of the caudal VRG but not by Botzinger complex neurons.\r"

Removal efficiencies were measured as a function of O3 concentration (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 ppm), mode of breathing (nose only, mouth only, and oronasal), and respiration frequency (12 and 24 breaths/min). Subjects were placed in a controlled environmental chamber into which O3 was introduced. A small polyethylene tube was then inserted into the nose of each subject, with the tip positioned in the posterior pharynx. Samples of air were collected from the posterior pharynx through the tube and into a rapidly responding O3 analyzer yielding inspiratory and expiratory O3 concentrations in the posterior pharynx. The O3 removal efficiency of the extrathoracic airways was computed with the use of the inspiratory concentration and the chamber concentration, and intrathoracic removal efficiency was computed with the use of the inspiratory and expiratory concentrations. The mean extrathoracic removal efficiency for all measurements was 39.6 +/- 0.7% (SE), and the mean intrathoracic removal efficiency was 91.0 +/- 0.5%. Significantly less O3 was removed both extrathoracically and intrathoracically when subjects breathed at 24 breaths/min compared with 12 breaths/min (P less than 0.001). O3 concentration had no effect on extrathoracic removal efficiency, but there was a significantly greater intrathoracic removal efficiency at 0.4 ppm than at 0.1 ppm (P less than 0.05). Mode of breathing significantly affected extrathoracic removal efficiency, with less O3 removed during nasal breathing than during either mouth breathing or oronasal breathing (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Epinephrine treatment decreased RBC transit times and increased exchange rates in the regions with the shortest transit times but did not change the pulmonary recovery of radiolabeled PMN's. When regions of similar RBC transit time were compared, epinephrine did not affect PMN retention at short transit times but did produce greater retention at long transit times. These data suggest that the major effect of epinephrine was to increase the proportion of the lung having short RBC transit times and fast exchange rates between the marginated and circulating pools. However, this effect did not decrease the overall retention of PMN's most likely because it was balanced by recruitment of additional capillary segments, which increased PMN retention in regions with longer transit times.\r"

Ten men (mean age 24 yr) were studied at rest, during 40 min of cycling at 40 and 60% of peak O2 uptake, and 10 min into recovery. DLCO was measured in the seated position during a 10-s breath hold at total lung capacity. At rest the breath hold caused a significant fall in stroke volume (SV, -16%) and an increase in heart rate (HR, +20%) with no change in cardiac output (Q). The resting DLCO of 36.5 ml.min-1.mmHg-1 increased by 28 and 48%, respectively, during the low- and moderate-intensity cycling. The breath hold while cycling caused a significant decrease in SV and Q, but HR did not change. Likewise, during recovery SV and Q fell with the breath hold but again HR did not change. A significant fall in systolic (-17%), diastolic (-12.5%), and mean arterial pressure (-15%) occurred during the breath hold at rest and during and after the exercise. The reduction observed in SV and blood pressure most likely reflected a decrease in venous return. The differences observed in the HR response before, compared with during and after exercise, were consistent with a resetting or shift in the operating point of the arterial baroreflex. Because blood flow fell during the exercise and recovery breath-hold maneuver, the \"true\" DLCO may have been underestimated during and after cycling.\r"

These observations suggest that with induced constriction the hysteresis of airways exceeds that of the parenchyma. In contrast with humans, a previous study of ours on dogs indicated that induced increases in airway resistance were unaffected by DI, suggesting that hysteresis of airways and parenchyma were equal. We hypothesized therefore that in constricted dog lungs, any differences that might arise in isovolumic Vmax between PEFV and MEFV maneuvers would not be due to changes in airway caliber but rather would be wholly determined by isovolumic differences in deflational recoil pressures. Recoil pressures were dynamically measured using six separate alveolar capsules in each of six dogs. At base line there were no significant differences between isovolumic recoil pressures or maximal flows with volume history, suggesting equal degrees of airway and parenchymal hysteresis. After histamine-induced constriction there were also no isovolumic differences in flows, but due to striking nonhomogeneities in dynamic recoil pressure among alveolar capsules, it was not possible to express a single meaningful recoil pressure pertinent to the lungs as a whole. These findings are consistent with the idea that isovolumic comparisons of Vmax serve as a reasonable indicator of changes in the relative degree of airway and parenchymal hysteresis.\r"

  ".W": "These experiments were designed to estimate the involvement of the sympathetic innervation in regulation of hindlimb muscle blood flow distribution among and within muscles during submaximal locomotory exercise in rats. Blood flows to 32 hindlimb muscles and 13 other selected tissues were measured using the radiolabeled microsphere technique, before exercise and at 0.5, 2, 5, and 15 min of treadmill exercise at 15 m/min. The two groups of rats studied were 1) intact control, and 2) acutely sympathectomized (hindlimb sympathectomy accomplished by bilateral section of the lumbar sympathetic chain and its connections to the spinal cord at L2-L3). There were no differences in total hindlimb muscle blood flow among the two groups during preexercise or at 30 s or 2 min of exercise. However, flow was higher in eight individual muscles at 2 min of exercise in the sympathectomized rats. At 5 and 15 min of exercise there was higher total hindlimb muscle blood flow in the denervated group compared with control. These differences were also present in many individual muscles. Our results suggest that 1) sympathetic nerves do not exert a net influence on the initial elevations in muscle blood flow at the beginning of exercise, 2) sympathetic nerves are involved in regulating muscle blood flow during steady-state submaximal exercise in conscious rats, and 3) these changes are seen in muscles of all fiber types.\r"

There was no consistent change in the pulmonary ventilation, total pulmonary resistance, the work performed on the lungs, or the change in intraesophageal pressure with tidal breathing. The improvement in the stability of the chest wall, as indicated by the change in these dynamic measurements of diaphragmatic function, parallels the decrease in static chest wall compliance and the clinical course of the resolution of apnea of prematurity.\r"

  ".W": "In preliminary studies of antigen-induced airway inflammation, we noted an apparent increase in peribronchiolar mast cell number. Experiments were thus undertaken to investigate the nature of this migration of mast cells into the central and peripheral airway epithelium and to determine its time course. The tracheae and small airways of 10 anesthetized mongrel dogs were exposed via a bronchoscope to Ascaris suum antigen (Ag), fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP), ovalbumin (OVA), and isotonic saline (SAL). In the central airways, all stimuli provoked a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in mast cell numbers at the base of the airway epithelium within 3 h. In the peripheral airways, only Ag aerosol stimulated a significant mast cell increase compared with unexposed tissue. In a second series of experiments, the trachea of seven dogs were exposed to 0.026, 0.26, and 2.6 micrograms of Ag. The tissue was collected at 1, 3, 6, and 10 h after exposure. In these experiments, there was a significant mast cell increase seen within 1 h but it was not dose dependent. By 6-10 h after exposure, mast cell counts were not significantly different from the unexposed condition, which is consistent with the idea that some of the cells either degranulated or migrated into the airway lumen. We conclude that mast cell migration is an acute response that can be demonstrated within 1 h of stimulation with Ag. The observation that nonimmunological stimuli may, in some cases, also stimulate mast cell movement affords the possibility that this process represents a generalized response to airway irritation.\r"

Physiol. 61: 539-544, 1986). How the two muscles respond to posture, however, is not known. Thirteen vagotomized, phrenicotomized, spontaneously breathing animals were thus studied during multiple postural changes from supine to 80 degrees head up and 20 degrees head down. Head-up tilting elicited a gradual increase in the electrical activation of both the triangularis sterni and the parasternals. Recruitment of the triangularis sterni promoted an increase in the amount of expiratory muscle shortening, but recruitment of the parasternals was invariably associated with a considerable reduction in the amount of inspiratory muscle shortening. This reduction was abolished after sectioning of the abdominal wall. We conclude that 1) the contribution of the canine triangularis sterni to rib movement increases with the assumption of the upright posture, whereas the contribution of the parasternals decreases and 2) this decrease results primarily from the load imposed on the rib cage by gravitational forces. Thus assuming the upright posture adversely affects the rib cage inspiratory muscles as well as the diaphragm.\r"
