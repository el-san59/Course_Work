At this time, these organelles and metabolic pathways appear to be the most promising for potential exploitation for chemotherapeutic purposes. Compounds of current experimental interest also are discussed. These are agents that have shown promise in the laboratory and for which data exist regarding probable mechanisms of action. The activities of these agents correlated, in so far as is possible, with those structures or metabolic pathways in the trypanonsome that are affected by their actions. The compounds are of two general groups: nitro compounds and purine analogues.\r"

The knee joint (left, 11 patients; right, four) was most commonly affected, and the left groin was the most frequent site of drug injections, a finding that suggests a relationship between the sites of injection and infection. Fever was absent in 16 (36%) of 45 patients. The predominant pathogens isolated were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and groups A and G streptococci. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was much less common (11% of patients). Treatment included bed rest, intravenous antibiotics, and arthrocentesis when needed. Surgery was required in only seven (16%) of 45 patients. The immediate prognosis for intravenous drug abusers with skeletal infection was excellent. Attempts to obtain follow-up information from most patients, however, were unsuccessful.\r"

Common clinical findings were similar to those in brain abscess due to other causes and included fever (57%), headache (57%), and focal neurologic signs (64%). Distinctive, however, was the unusually high frequency of associated meningitis and bacteremia; blood cultures were positive in all eight cases in which they were performed. Eight (57%) of the 14 patients died. L. monocytogenes should be included in the differential diagnosis of brain abscess in patients with leukemia and in renal transplant recipients. Listerial brain abscess is highly unlikely when blood culture results are negative.\r"

In five patients the site of infection was pleuropulmonary; in 14, bone; in 11, skin and soft tissue; and in one, intraabdominal. The commonest anaerobes isolated were anaerobic cocci and Bacteroides species; the commonest aerobic and facultative bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and various gram-positive cocci. All of six assessable patients given sulbactam/ampicillin alone had satisfactory clinical responses, as did seven of nine patients given sulbactam/ampicillin plus gentamicin, all of six patients given clindamycin alone, and six of nine patients given clindamycin plus gentamicin. Pathogens were totally or partially eradicated in four of five, eight of nine, four of five, and three of nine assessable patients given these same regimens. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were relatively uncommon. Overall, sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as clindamycin in the treatment of aerobic or mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections; however, the concomitant use of gentamicin was frequently required with both regimens.\r"

Forty-five men with PPNG urethritis were enrolled in a study of the efficacy of treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin plus probenecid. Diagnosis and evaluation of cure were based on culture results. The agar-plate dilution method was used for susceptibility testing, and the chromogenic cephalosporin test was used for detection of beta-lactamases. MICs of various antibiotics for the isolates were high. MICs of sulbactam/ampicillin were 0.25-4 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml, a value 16-fold lower than that for ampicillin alone (MIC90 greater than 32 micrograms/ml). Patients were treated with 1 g of probenecid orally and either one vial of sodium sulbactam/ampicillin or two vials intramuscularly. Each vial contained 0.5 g of sodium sulbactam and 1 g of sodium ampicillin. Patients were followed up for three to five days. All patients but one were cured, and no remarkable adverse reactions were noted. The two regimens of sulbactam/ampicillin were equally effective in the treatment of uncomplicated PPNG in men.\r"

In this study, we cloned the gene encoding one of these antigens into Escherichia coli and tested the effectiveness of the recombinant-made product as a vaccine for Rocky Mountain spotted fever. A clone bank of R strain R. rickettsii DNA was made in E. coli K-12 by using the plasmid vector pBR322. Transformants were screened for their ability to make rickettsial antigens by reactivity with rabbit antibodies to R. rickettsii. One of the transformants, EM24(pGAM21), made a product reactive with two monoclonal antibodies that recognize a 155-kilodalton protein of R. rickettsii. One of the monoclonal antibodies was a member of a class of antibodies that react to heat-sensitive epitopes and protect mice injected with a potentially lethal dose of viable R. rickettsii. The cloned product contained this protective heat-sensitive epitope. In order to obtain enhanced expression, the gene was subcloned downstream of the lactose promoter on the plasmid vector pUC8. A sonic lysate of E. coli harboring the pUC8 subclone was used successfully as a vaccine to protect mice injected with a lethal dose of the viable R. rickettsii.\r"

The hyperpolarization is produced by the opening of potassium channels and involves an intermediary guanosine triphosphate-binding regulatory (G) protein. Potassium channels in isolated, inside-out patches of membranes from atrial cells now are shown to be activated by a purified pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein of subunit composition alpha beta gamma, with an alpha subunit of 40,000 daltons. Thus, mammalian atrial muscarinic potassium channels are activated directly by a G protein, not indirectly through a cascade of intermediary events. The G protein regulating these channels is identified as a potent Gk; it is active at 0.2 to 1 pM. Thus, proteins other than enzymes can be under control of receptor coupling G proteins.\r"

Comparison of known sequences with the Lactobacillus casei structure suggests that they all have a common core structure around which loops are inserted or deleted in different sequences. Residues from both subunits contribute to each active site. Two arginine side chains can contribute to binding phosphate on the substrate. The side chains of several conserved amino acids can account for other determinants of substrate binding.\r"

The present experiments show that these barrier tissues contain receptors and second messenger systems for atriopeptins, recently identified cardiac peptides involved in peripheral water regulation. They also show that atriopeptins can alter the rate of cerebrospinal fluid production. Because the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers are involved in normal water movements in the central nervous system, these studies suggest that brain barrier tissues may be important end organs for the atriopeptins and that atriopeptins could have therapeutic application to disorders of water balance in the central nervous system. An isolated, purified population of atriopeptin receptor cells, obtained from choroid epithelium, was used in these experiments. This cell population may provide a valuable model system for investigating the intracellular biochemical mechanisms through which atriopeptins exert their actions.\r"

Here it will be shown that fatty acid is covalently attached to vinculin in vivo. Furthermore, in chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus, tsNY68, the acylation of vinculin at the permissive temperature was less than one-third that at the nonpermissive temperature. Thus, the covalent binding of lipid to vinculin is a transformation-sensitive event. The covalent modification of vinculin by lipids could be directly or indirectly involved in its reversible association with membranes. This modification may also provide a mechanism to alter the organization of vinculin within cells and thereby play a regulatory role in anchoring or stabilizing microfilament bundles at plasma membranes.\r"

The rapid brain uptake and retention of radioactivity for both 11C tracers indicated irreversible trapping. The anatomical distribution of 11C paralleled the distribution of MAO A and MAO B in human brain in autopsy material. The corpus striatum, thalamus, and brainstem contained high MAO activity. The magnitudes of uptake of both [11C]clorgyline and L-[11C]deprenyl were markedly reduced in one subject treated with the antidepressant MAO inhibitor phenelzine. A comparison of the brain uptake and retention of the 11C-labeled inactive (D-) and active (L-) enantiomers of deprenyl showed rapid clearance of the inactive enantiomer and retention of the active enantiomer within MAO B-rich brain structures, in agreement with the known stereoselectivity of MAO B for L-deprenyl. Prior treatment with unlabeled L-deprenyl prevented retention of L-[11C]deprenyl. Thus, suicide enzyme inactivators labeled with positron emitters can be used to quantitate the distribution and kinetic characteristics of MAO in human brain structures.\r"

To test the hypothesis that the decline in hypercapnic drive due to sleep loss is mediated by endorphin production, we measured loaded and unloaded CO2 response after injection of placebo and naloxone in 11 normal subjects who were alternately rested and sleep-deprived. Blood for beta-endorphin and epinephrine assay was drawn before testing each day. Unloaded CO2 response was lower after sleep loss than after sleep restoration; naloxone had no effect on this difference. Likewise, there was no difference between CO2 response after naloxone administration and CO2 response in control subjects. beta-Endorphin activity did not rise after sleep loss. Loaded CO2 response was reduced compared to unloaded response and was not affected by sleep loss or by naloxone. The serum epinephrine level rose significantly with sleep loss. We conclude that naloxone is not a respiratory stimulant in normal people, and that it does not reverse the fall in CO2 response that follows sleep loss.\r"

  ".U": "87094581\r", 
  ".W": "Stress ulceration continues to be a problem in critically ill surgical patients and occasionally occurs even when prophylaxis is attempted with standard agents. Tube feedings protect against ulceration in clinical settings. Many tube feeding formulas and intragastric 25 per cent glucose alone prevent gastric lesions in the rat restraint model. Endogenous cytoprotective prostaglandin release is stimulated by the application of hyperosmolar sugar solutions to the gastric mucosa. To determine whether all or part of the protection afforded by 25 per cent glucose is mediated through stimulation of endogenous prostaglandins, hyperosmolar glucose was tested in restrained rats with and without concurrent cyclo-oxygenase blockade. Intragastric hyperosmolar glucose protected against gross and microscopic gastric lesions, raised the blood glucose level and elevated the gastric mucosal pH. Although cyclo-oxygenase blockade alone worsened the lesions produced by restraint, blocking cyclo-oxygenase in the rats given 25 per cent glucose did not lessen the protective effect of hyperosmolar sugar. We conclude that endogenous prostaglandins are useful in gastric mucosal defense but are not necessary for the protection afforded by 25 per cent glucose. It is likely that providing glucose directly to the stressed gastric mucosa enhances several aspects of gastric mucosal defense.\r"

Mucopolysaccharidoses should not be diagnosed solely on clinical grounds, since laboratory confirmation by specific enzyme assay in now available. Prenatal diagnosis is possible for MPSs by amniocentesis. Chorionic villus sampling offers the possibility of first trimester diagnosis. Carrier detection in Hunter's syndrome is not routinely performed, but new procedures may make this needed service more available. No definitive treatment is available. Bone marrow transplantation appears to improve the somatic disease, but correction of the central nervous system disorder may not be possible. The successful development of gene-therapy may in the future provide a means of treatment in MPSs. The management of MPSs can be improved by a better understanding of the natural history of the somatic and central nervous system deterioration in the different disorders. Systematic evaluation and appropriate treatment can lead to an improved quality of life.\r"

  ".W": "Our experience with the use of five new antiarrhythmic drugs for treating life-threatening arrhythmias in children will be briefly reviewed. Prevention of recurrent episodes of atrial flutter with digoxin and local anesthetic antiarrhythmic drugs often is only moderately successful, benefiting 65% of patients. Amiodarone is particularly useful for those patients who cannot be controlled on this regimen. We caution that the heart rate be monitored carefully when therapy with amiodarone is initiated in patients likely to have sick sinus syndrome. We have found mexiletine useful for controlling significant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congenital heart disease. Likewise, 79% (11 of 14) of patients with ventricular tachycardia treated with amiodarone were well controlled. However, the range of disease categories (congenital heart disease, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy) in which amiodarone is effective is much broader than for mexiletine. Although other investigators have used amiodarone successfully for controlling supraventricular tachycardia in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or secondary to concealed accessory AV connections, we recommend surgical ablation. Propafenone has significantly improved our ability to control postoperative JET. Although JET is self-limited in duration and spontaneously remits, it frequently produces life-threatening hemodynamic compromise in the postoperative setting. Propafenone slows the ventricular rate into a range in which AV sequential pacing may be instituted. Generally, after 24 to 72 hours, the patient may be quickly weaned from propafenone. Chronic incessant supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is frequently associated with a dilated cardiomyopathy. The two most common mechanisms of incessant SVT are PJRT and AET. We have found encainide and ethmozine extremely effective in suppressing tachycardia episodes in PJRT and AET, respectively. Medical therapy has been associated with few side effects.\r"

Flecainide, 0.1 to 10.0 micrograms/ml, produced concentration-dependent decreases in action potential amplitude, overshoot, and phase O Vmax of adult ventricular myocardium and Purkinje fibers. The greatest effects were on Vmax. Neonatal action potential characteristics were affected to a lesser degree by flecainide. Flecainide had disparate effects on myocardial and Purkinje fiber repolarization and refractoriness. In adult ventricular myocardium, action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP) increased progressively with drug concentration. APD and ERP were increased to a lesser degree in neonatal myocardium. In adult Purkinje fibers, APD decreased progressively with increasing flecainide concentrations. ERP decreased at 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml, but returned to control values at 10.0 micrograms/ml. APD and ERP of neonatal Purkinje fibers responded to a lesser degree. At faster stimulation frequencies (2 to 4 Hz), flecainide produced significant frequency-dependent decreases in Vmax in adult Purkinje fibers. Such use-dependency was not evident in neonatal fibers. These data indicate a significantly lower sensitivity of immature cardiac tissues to the electrophysiologic effects of flecainide.\r"

Total n-3 fatty acids, 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3, 22:5n-3, and 22:6n-3 were decreased in both plasma and erythrocytes. Patients had a slight but definite scaly dermatitis, which disappeared with essential fatty acids supplementation. Simultaneously, levels of 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3, 22:5n-3, 22:6n-3, 20:3n-9, and total n-3 fatty acids became normal while 18:2n-6, 20:3n-6, 20:4n-6, and total n-6 acids were unchanged or slightly lowered.

A nonrandomized dose of cimetidine 1200 mg HS was also studied. For all four treatments, daytime (0730-2230 h) intragastric acidity was reduced by 4-30% in the normals and by 10-44% in the duodenal ulcer patients (NS), while 24-h intragastric acidity was reduced by 44-46% and 40-64%, respectively (p less than 0.05). Reduction in nocturnal acid output was 82-96% in normals and 91-99% in duodenal ulcer, respectively. Pepsin concentration was unaffected by treatment but pepsin concentration was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in patients than in normals. Mean 24-h gastric acid secretion was reduced by a single nighttime treatment with an H2-receptor antagonist, while nocturnal acid secretion was virtually abolished. H2 antagonists given only at night deserve further clinical evaluation to determine the minimal effective dose and optimal duration of suppression to achieve ulcer healing.\r"

To investigate whether the 14q32 breakpoint in AT occurs within the immunoglobulin gene cluster as is frequently detected in B-cell lymphoma, immunoglobulin clones were hybridized to Southern blots of DNA isolated from the T-cells of two AT patients with this chromosome 14 translocation. The 14q32 translocation breakpoints in these patients are apparently not within JH, S mu, C mu, S alpha-1 or -2, or C alpha-1 or -2, but one of the patients has an inverted duplication of at least 26 kilobases (kb) of the C mu region, with an associated 5' flanking deletion. The point of origin of the inverted duplication is within JH near the recombination signal for the J4 gene. This suggests that normal JH recombination mechanisms may have played a role in the development of this 14q32 chromosomal aberration. The presence of AT chromosomal breakpoints near other rearranging genes suggests a role for exaggerated recombination in the pathogenesis of chromosomal instability in AT.\r"

In 20 admissions of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (Group 1), the patients had no other conditions or medications known to alter acid-base or electrolyte homeostasis, whereas in 80 admissions of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (Group 2), the patients had at least one of these factors. Analysis of the change in total carbon dioxide compared with the change in anion gap in Group 1 and control subjects revealed the following relation: change in total carbon dioxide = 0.74 + 1.00 X change in anion gap, in meq/liter (r = 0.886, p less than 10(-7]. The 95 percent prediction interval for detecting mixed acid-base disorders with this equation was +/- 8 meq/liter. Analysis of all admissions of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and control subjects combined showed that the anion gap increased 0.24 meq/liter per mg/dl increase in blood urea nitrogen (with total carbon dioxide constant). Because the highest blood urea nitrogen level in Group 1 and control subjects was 22 mg/dl, the change in total carbon dioxide-change in anion gap regression is generally not valid for blood urea nitrogen levels higher than 22 mg/dl. Thus, both the wide prediction interval and volume depletion (as reflected by blood urea nitrogen level) impair the usefulness of the anion gap as a screen for mixed acid-base disorders in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.\r"

Since both species of IFN affect monocyte (Mo) functions, it is conceivable that these effects are mediated through Mo. In the present study, the effect of IFN-gamma and alpha on concanavalin A (Con A)-driven T-cell proliferation was investigated under suboptimal culture conditions. T-cell proliferation was augmented by IFN-gamma. The stimulatory effect of IFN-gamma was Mo mediated and required the pretreatment of Mo with IFN-gamma prior to co-culture with T-cells. Addition of IFN-gamma during co-culture or pretreatment of T-cells with IFN-gamma was ineffective in achieving augmentation. IFN-gamma induced enhanced T-cell proliferation was not due to increased interleukin-I (IL-I) production by Mo pretreated with IFN-gamma, because addition of IL-I to control Mo-T-cells co-culture failed to increase T-cell proliferation. In contrast, IFN-alpha suppressed T-cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha was not mediated through Mo and could be achieved by preincubating the T-cells with IFN-alpha. These results demonstrate opposing effects of the two species of IFN on Con A-driven T-cell proliferation. In addition, Mo play an obligatory role in IFN-gamma induced stimulation, whereas Mo-IFN-alpha interaction is not required for IFN-alpha mediated suppression of T-cell proliferation.\r"

  ".U": "87097505\r", 
  ".W": "During a 5-year period, an enzyme-linked antiglobulin test was used to screen and quantitate fetal-maternal hemorrhage in 789 consecutive D-negative mothers who were delivered of D-positive babies. Six hundred seventy-two patients (85.2%) had no detectable fetal-maternal hemorrhage, and 117 patients (14.8%) had a detectable fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Eight of the 789 (1%) had a fetal-maternal hemorrhage greater than 30 ml and required more than one vial of Rh immune globulin. Two patients with fetal-maternal hemorrhage of 29 and 30 ml also received additional Rh immune globulin. Each case was reviewed for the presence of high-risk features that are thought to predict patients at risk for fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Patients having a cesarean section or complicated vaginal delivery were considered to be in a group at high risk for fetal-maternal hemorrhage, while those with a spontaneous vaginal delivery were considered not to be at risk for fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Thirty-two of 237 patients (13.5%) in the risk group and 82 of 552 patients (15.3%) in the group not at risk had detectable fetal-maternal hemorrhage. The incidence of fetal-maternal hemorrhage for these two groups was not statistically different (p greater than 0.50 by chi 2 analysis). If only patients in the risk group had been screened for fetal-maternal hemorrhage, then five of 10 (50%) who required more than one vial of Rh immune globulin would have been undertreated and at risk for developing anti-D antibodies. In addition, newborn birth weight, Apgar scores, and hematocrits were examined for 13 cases of fetal-maternal hemorrhage of greater than or equal to 21 ml, and none of these characteristics could be used to predict patients at risk for fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Therefore, no maternal or newborn characteristics could be identified that would reliably predict patients at risk for fetal-maternal hemorrhage. We conclude that all D-negative patients with D-positive babies should continue to be screened for fetal-maternal hemorrhage to identify those patients requiring more than one vial of Rh immune globulin.\r"

Eight positive results were detected, with a cost of $1755 per positive case. This compared favorably with the frequency and cost of detection of syphilis in the same population. Routine hepatitis B screening is recommended for consideration in similar prenatal populations.\r"

Exposure of TM4 cells to 5 micrograms gossypol/ml for greater than 1 hour has severe, deleterious effects on the structure and function of mitochondria. Mitochondrial function in TM4 cells was monitored by employing a fluorochrome, Rhodamine 123, which accumulates rapidly in mitochondria having a high transmembrane potential. In gossypol-treated TM4 cells, Rhodamine 123 mitochondrial staining was reduced significantly 1 hour after the drug addition and reached a minimal level at 3 hour. Concomitantly, cytoplasmic vacuoles were detected even at the light-microscopic level. Electron-microscopic studies revealed that these vacuoles were distended mitochondria. The morphology of these damaged organelles changed gradually, starting with the transformation of the tubular mitochondria into the rounded forms. Cristae concurrently collapsed onto the organelles' periphery. In addition, the ground matrixes disappeared, and the mitochondria appeared as empty vacuoles. Further evidence that these vacuoles were distended mitochondria was derived from the cytochemical localization of cytochrome c oxidase in these vacuole-like structures.\r"

The stimulatory effect is not related to toxicity or damage to the respiratory mucosa, as well as could be determined by ultrastructural examination of the explants after exposure. Bacteria isolated from patients with a history of chronic obstructive lung disease (P aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis, H influenzae, and S pneumoniae from chronic bronchitis) do not demonstrate increased frequency of positive strains or greater stimulation of secretion than organisms isolated from other individuals. At least three stimulatory substances are found in cell-free filtrates of P aeruginosa. They appear to be proteins of molecular weight 60,000-100,000 as determined by gel filtration. Within the crude filtrate, they are relatively stable to heat, proteolysis, and storage at 4 C and in liquid nitrogen. The stimulatory activity is not lost upon subculture of the bacteria. When isolated from the filtrate by column chromatography, they become labile to heat and trypsin. Isolated active fractions show proteolytic activity coinciding with mucin-stimulating capacity, suggesting a relationship with Pseudomonas proteases. Stimulatory substances released by S pneumoniae and H influenzae appear to be different from those elaborated by Pseudomonas. They are extremely labile to heat and storage, and the capacity to stimulate secretion is lost on subculture. Preliminary gel filtration indicates the S pneumoniae stimulatory substance(s) is in a molecular weight range of 100,000-300,000 daltons, while that of H influenzae is between 50,000 and 200,000. The results suggest bacteria which chronically infect or colonize respiratory airways of individuals suffering from obstructive lung disease can elaborate extracellular product(s) capable of stimulating secretion of mucin. Thus, the bacteria themselves may contribute to local manifestations and, ultimately, to the pathogenesis of obstructive disease.\r"

The self-help program had the lowest total cost, lowest per cent quit rate, lowest time requirement for participants, and was the most cost-effective. The most effective program, the smoking cessation class, required the most time from participants, had the highest total cost, and was the least cost-effective. The smoking contest was in-between the other two programs in total costs, per cent quit rate, and cost-effectiveness; it required the same time commitment from participants as the self-help program. These findings are interpreted within the context of community-based intervention in which the argument is made that cost-effectiveness is only one of several factors that should determine the selection of smoking cessation programs.\r"

Most of the injuries were mild, but in 32% of the injuries, the athlete missed more than 2 weeks of play. No medical attention was sought in 55% of the cases. About 50% of the athletes with a sprain had residual symptoms from their injuries; 15% of the injured athletes felt that their residual symptoms compromised their playing performance.

The total parenteral nutrition group had a significantly higher rate of catheter-related sepsis than did an additional group of contemporaneous patients without pancreatitis who received total parental nutrition (10.5 percent and 1.47 percent, respectively; p less than 0.01). There was no advantage to the use of early total parenteral nutrition; that is, there was no difference in the number of days to oral intake, total hospital stay, or number of complications of pancreatitis. Patients with zero or one Ranson's criterion on admission were more likely to be eating by the seventh hospital day than were those with two or more Ranson's criteria (80 percent and 54 percent, respectively; p less than 0.05). The early institution of total parenteral nutrition in patients with acute pancreatitis did not appear to improve the outcome. Its use should be limited to prolonged periods of no oral intake or treatment of a specific complication, such as a pseudocyst.\r"

In addition, sensitivity of enzyme to ethanol was lower in patients with high agitation-anxiety ratings and correlated negatively with agitation and anxiety scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. There were no relationships between (Na+,K+)-ATPase measures and depressive symptoms, history of treatment for depression, or family history of depression. These data suggest that tolerance to the effects of ethanol on (Na+,K+)-ATPase occurs in man and may be related to the severity of ethanol dependence or withdrawal.\r"

This technique, which separates all transferrin components isoelectric above pH 5.65, showed a very good reproducibility and accuracy with a coefficient of variation between 5 and 9%. 77 alcoholic patients could be clearly separated from 80 healthy \"normal consumers\" and 33 total abstainers with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 91%. The values were significantly correlated to the amount of alcohol consumed during the latest month, and declined in abstaining alcoholics with a mean biological half-life of 17 days. Elevated levels occasionally appeared in healthy individuals after daily consumption of 60 g of ethanol during a 10-day period. In a sample of 187 patients with nonalcohol-related conditions only 2% false-positive values were found. This method is suggested as a potential tool for detecting and monitoring alcohol abuse.\r"

Total cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral perfusion pressure, plasma halothane concentration, and arterial blood gas tensions and pH were measured in 14 rhesus monkeys mechanically ventilated with 0.5% (inspired) halothane, 33% O2 and balance N2O. Halothane was increased to 2.0% and the measurements repeated 30 and 60 min later. Then either 0.9% NaCl (controls n = 6) or propranolol (n = 8), 1.0 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 10 min, and the measurements repeated at 70, 90, 120, and 150 min. After 30 min at 2.0% halothane, CBF increased in the controls by 50% (P less than 0.05) from 92 +/- 8 (mean +/- SD) to 137 +/- 39 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 and in the propranolol group by 30% (P less than 0.05) from 106 +/- 33 to 137 +/- 28 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1. After 2.5 hr of 2.0% halothane anesthesia, CBF remained elevated above baseline levels, but by only 28 and 23% in the control and propranolol groups, respectively. Cerebrovascular resistance was identical in both groups (0.55 +/- 0.33 vs 0.53 +/- 0.13 mm Hg X ml-1 X 100 g 1 X min 1). The results show that there is only a 10-20% return of CBF toward baseline levels after up to 2.5 hr of 2% halothane anesthesia. The results also indicate that halothane-induced cerebrovascular dilation is not mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.\r"

All patients received 0.05 mg/kg alfentanil as an intravenous bolus injection. Plasma concentrations were measured at intervals up to 8 hr, using a specific radioimmunoassay technique. Protein binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Elimination half-life and plasma clearance were similar in both groups. The volume of distribution at steady state was greater (P less than 0.02) in patients with renal failure (405 +/- 86 ml/kg) than in patients with normal renal function (281 +/- 97 ml/kg). Patients with renal failure had a higher (P less than 0.01) alfentanil plasma free fraction (0.19 +/- 0.06) than patients with normal renal function (0.11 +/- 0.03). When kinetic parameters were corrected for protein binding, the unbound volume of distribution and the free drug clearance were unchanged in patients with renal failure. These results suggest that the modification of alfentanil free fraction in renal failure does not induce any change in elimination but may influence the distribution of alfentanil.\r"

Duration of analgesia was significantly longer in group I than in group II patients (76 +/- 3.8 vs 42.9 +/- 1 min, P less than 0.001).

Reperfusion of the graft liver resulted in an increase in arterial glucose levels to 206 +/- 17 and 240 +/- 24 mg/dl, 5 and 30 min after reperfusion, respectively (P less than 0.05). Hepatic venous blood glucose levels increased after reperfusion (405 +/- 37 and 346 +/- 41 mg/dl, 5 and 30 min after reperfusion, respectively) and were significantly higher than in arterial blood (P less than 0.05). Arterial plasma insulin, measured in five animals, did not change significantly during the procedure, whereas plasma glucagon levels, stable during the preanhepatic and anhepatic stages, increased steadily after reperfusion of the graft liver, from 66.1 +/- 14.2 to 108.4 +/- 38.1 pg/ml (P less than 0.05). This study shows that in dogs with ketamine anesthesia mild hypoglycemia occurs during the anhepatic stage of liver transplantation without exogenous glucose administration followed by hyperglycemia on reperfusion of the graft liver, possibly secondary to the release of glucose from the donor liver.\r"

The peak of the compound action potential (APc) and the firing threshold for single axons were measured. The amount of lidocaine required at steady state to double the firing threshold of single fibers or to reduce the peak of the APc by 40% was used as the index of potency. Acidification with CO2 increased potency (less lidocaine was needed to achieve either criterion), whereas acidification with HCl diminished potency, as compared with alkaline conditions. These results were true whether or not the perineurium was present. Frequency-dependent block (Bf) increased in acid conditions produced by CO2, whereas Bf was less under acid conditions produced with HCl (P less than 0.02). The experiments indicate that CO2 potentiates conduction block with lidocaine either by a direct effect on the membrane or by its indirect action on intracellular pH, but not from effects on the extracellular pH.\r"

All patients were given 20 micrograms/kg alfentanil as an intravenous bolus injection. Plasma concentrations were measured at intervals up to 6 h by radioimmunoassay. Plasma protein binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis using tritiated alfentanil. The optimal pharmacokinetic model for alfentanil was an open two-compartment model. Total apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) was 457 +/- 160 ml/kg in adults and 163 +/- 110 ml/kg in children (P less than 0.01). When recalculated by surface area Vdss was still decreased in children (P less than 0.01). Plasma clearance (Cl) was similar in the two groups. Terminal elimination half-life was significantly shorter in children (40 +/- 9 min) than in adults (97 +/- 22 min; P less than 0.01). The shorter elimination half-life could be due to the smaller total apparent volume of distribution in children. Plasma protein binding was comparable between children and adults and could not explain the smaller volume of distribution in children. It is suggested that the smaller volume of distribution of alfentanil in children is a result of the decreased percentage of fat tissue in children.\r"

  ".W": "The population pharmacokinetic parameters describing the plasma concentration versus time profile of alfentanil in patients undergoing general anesthesia were determined from 614 plasma concentration measurements collected in four previously reported studies with a total of 45 patients. A nonlinear regression analysis evaluating the effect of six concomitant variables revealed a significant influence of body weight on the volume of the central compartment (Vc), and a decrease with age of total body clearance (CL) and of redistribution rate from the deep compartment (k31). A small but significant effect of sex on the Vc was also observed. The duration of anesthesia and the concomitant administration of inhalational anesthetics had no effect on alfentanil pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean CL and Vc for alfentanil in a 70-kg male, aged less than 40 yr, were estimated as 0.356 l/min and 7.77 l, respectively. After correction for age, body weight, and sex, the remaining interindividual variability of alfentanil kinetics (expressed as coefficient of variation) was 48% for CL and 33% for Vc. These population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates should increase the accuracy of predicting concentration-time profiles for intravenous alfentanil infusions. A computer program is presented that allows prediction of the alfentanil plasma concentration and the 68% interval limits of the prediction from the study data analysis.\r"

  ".U": "87098075\r", 
  ".W": "It would be difficult for physicians or allergists to imagine doing without corticosteroids in managing difficult cases of bronchial asthma. It is beyond any doubt that CS act on many sites to help reverse the pathologic process of bronchial asthma. Corticosteroids enhance the beta-adrenergic response to relieve the muscle spasm. They also act by reversing the mucosal edema, decreasing vascular permeability by vasoconstriction, and inhibiting the release of LTC4 and LTD4. Corticosteroids reduce the mucus secretion by inhibiting the release of secretagogue from macrophages. Corticosteroids inhibit the late phase reaction by inhibiting the inflammatory response and interfering with chemotaxis. This action may be due to the inhibition of LTB4 release. The eosinopenic effect of corticosteroids may help to prevent the cytotoxic effect of the major basic protein and other inflammatory mediators released from eosinophils. Corticosteroids have no effect on the immediate hypersensitivity reaction and have no direct role in bronchial reactivity. By blocking the late reaction, they prevent the increased airway reactivity observed with late bronchial reactions. The limitation of using corticosteroids are their side effects. They vary from tolerable to life threatening side effects. Each tissue in the body is a target for corticosteroids. The mechanism of adverse effects have been studied in extensive detail but many questions are yet to be answered. Alternate-day therapy and inhalation therapy are meant to minimize these side effects. The expansion of using inhaled steroid therapy and finding some inhaled preparations that have even less systemic side effects seems a reasonable approach to deal with severe asthma.\r"

Even the detection of specific antibodies on their own does not necessarily indicate that a given symptom is due to that antibody. Food allergy nevertheless exists. It is important that those observers fortunate enough to see many cases document their observations carefully and eventually publish them for the education of their less fortunate colleagues. Is food allergy more common in infants and young children? What happens as they grow older? How often is atopic eczema due to food allergy? Why are some foods more likely to be implicated than others? Does a negative RAST result eliminate the diagnosis or a positive one confirm it? Until the answers to these and other questions are known, the mainstay of diagnosis will be the history, and that of treatment will be the elimination diet.\r"

Fetuses of CO2-exposed mothers weighed less and had lungs that weighed less but when expressed per unit body weight were unchanged. Distended lung volumes were greatly increased in the CO2 group. Light microscope morphometry showed more mature lungs with increased volume proportion of air spaces, decreased air-space wall, and decreased nonparenchyma in CO2-exposed animals. Individual air-spaces were larger, gas exchanging surface area was increased, air-space walls were thinner, and higher ratios of mature to immature crests were found. Electron microscope morphometry showed decreased glycogen in alveolar Type II cells and increased volume proportion of lamellar bodies in the CO2 group. Type II cells were more cuboidal. We interpret these changes to represent increased tissue and cellular maturation in fetuses whose mothers breathed CO2. We speculate that the changes were brought about by increased fetal respiration, which may cause increased stretch and distention of the lung. Alternative mechanisms are discussed.\r"

The ventilatory response to CO2 (Read's method) was measured in triplicate prior to treatment and after 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 or more nights of therapy. Seven subjects were tested on at least 4 occasions. For each test, slope of the response line and position of the response line (ventilation at a PCO2 of 60 mm Hg) were calculated. The subjects with initial high daytime CO2 showed no change in slope of response with treatment but showed a progressive increase in ventilation at any given degree of PCO2. Ventilation at a PCO2 of 60 mm Hg increased from a mean of 20.0 +/- 1.3 SEM L/min by 8.0 +/- 2.5 SEM L/min after 2 nights of therapy (p less than 0.05, two-way analysis of variance), and by 16.2 +/- 1.9 L/min after 2 wk or more (p less than 0.01). On average, there was no significant change in either slope or position of response in the subjects with initially normal daytime PCO2. We conclude that airway obstruction in sleep (in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome) leads in some subjects to respiratory failure in the daytime, with a left shift in the ventilatory response to CO2, and that this changes is usually reversible during the next several days.\r"

  ".U": "87098218\r", 
  ".W": "Terfenadine (Seldane) is a new, highly potent H1 histamine receptor antagonist that in clinically effective doses is free of side effects. Because the low potency and specificity of many H1 receptor antagonists have made it difficult to define the precise role of histamine as a bronchoconstrictor mediator in asthma we have used terfenadine to define the degree and selectivity of H1 blockade that can be achieved in asthmatic airways. In a double-blind study, 9 asthmatic patients received placebo or terfenadine 60, 120, and 180 mg on separate days followed 3 h later by bronchial provocation with increasing concentrations of either histamine or methacholine. Terfenadine at 60, 120, and 180 mg produced significant bronchodilation with increases in FEV1 above baseline of 9.0, 9.5, and 10%, respectively (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01). All 3 doses of terfenadine displaced the histamine-FEV1 concentration response curves in a parallel fashion to the right in all subjects. When the degree of protection against histamine is expressed as a concentration ratio, terfenadine 60, 120, and 180 mg displaced the response curves by factors of 14.8 +/- 4.6, 22.9 +/- 6.7, and 34.3 +/- 8.4. In contrast to its effect on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, terfenadine failed to protect the airways against the constrictor effect of inhaled methacholine. Thus, terfenadine is a much more potent and selective H1 receptor antagonist in asthmatic airways than previously available antihistamines and should provide a powerful tool to define the contribution of histamine as a bronchoconstrictor mediator in asthma.\r"

In addition, we investigated the role of fibroblast prostaglandin production in mediating the effects that were noted. Gamma interferon was capable of bidirectional modulation of fibroblast growth since it stimulated the proliferation of quiescent cells and inhibited the proliferation of rapidly proliferating cells. In contrast, alpha A, alpha D, and beta interferons did not stimulate the proliferation of quiescent cells, but did inhibit the proliferation of rapidly proliferating cells. Gamma, alpha A, alpha D, and beta did not stimulate E series prostaglandin production by rapidly proliferating fibroblasts, and blocking fibroblast prostaglandin production did not reverse the inhibition of fibroblast growth caused by these interferons. Thus, gamma interferon can stimulate or inhibit, whereas alpha A, alpha D, and beta interferons only inhibit the growth of normal human lung fibroblasts. In addition, the inhibition of fibroblast growth caused by all 4 interferons appears to be independent of fibroblast prostaglandin production.\r"

The 26 feeding gastrostomies were 16 Stamm, eight permanent mucosal-lined, and two Witzel. The 30 feeding jejunostomies consisted of 19 Roux-en-Y, nine Stamm, and two Witzel. Patients with gastrostomy have had a mean follow-up of 100 days. Adverse events have occurred in 15/26 (58%), including 9 patients with pulmonary aspiration (35%), two of which were fatal. Twenty-three additional patients have died of underlying diseases. All 11 patients with tube jejunostomy died of underlying diseases within 4 months of surgery. The complication rate was 36%, including pulmonary aspiration in both patients with Witzel jejunostomy. The 19 patients with Roux-en-Y jejunostomy have had mean follow-up of 169 days. Complications have occurred in 9 patients (47%); 16/19 patients (mean age 55 years) have died of underlying disease. The mean age of the patients still alive is 35 years. Feeding jejunostomy has a lower incidence of complications, especially pulmonary aspiration, than gastrostomy. Stamm jejunostomy should be used for enteral feeding in older patients and in patients with short life expectancy. In younger patients requiring lifelong enteral feeding, Roux-en-Y jejunostomy should be used.\r"

Immune electron microscopy of a stool specimen obtained from this patient 10 days after the onset of symptoms showed virus-like particles, 27 nm in diameter, that were specifically aggregated by antibody contained in acute-phase sera from the three Pakistani patients, from patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis in Burma and Nepal, and from an experimentally infected marmoset. Recognition of three separate cases of probable epidemic-type non-A, non-B hepatitis in patients at one institution during such a short time suggests that Pakistan is endemic for this infection and that the disease may be more commonly spread to the United States than is now presumed.\r"

Testing for known resistance genes showed that these were present in the resistant isolates. Genetic transformation was used to construct strains with increasing levels of antibiotic resistance. Modification of the transformation protocol made it possible to isolate transformants at the highest (penicillin-resistant DNA donor) level of resistance. These transformants unexpectedly yielded two distinct penicillin-binding protein patterns when tested.\r"

This resistance was due to the acquisition of the resistance determinant tetM, a transposon-borne determinant initially found in the genus Streptococcus and more recently in Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Gardnerella vaginalis. In N. gonorrhoeae, the tetM determinant was located on a 25.2-megadalton plasmid. This plasmid arose from the insertion of tetM into the 24.5-megadalton gonococcal conjugative plasmid. The tetM determinant could be transferred to suitable recipient strains of N. gonorrhoeae by both genetic transformation and conjugation.\r"

Animals received either 600 or 1,200 mg of aztreonam administered intravenously over 6 h. Aztreonam did not readily enter the CSF in the absence of meningitis. In noninfected animals, mean concentrations in the CSF ranged from 1.1 to 3.0 micrograms/ml with the 600-mg dose and from 2.3 to 4.7 micrograms/ml with the 1,200-mg dose. In contrast, mean concentrations of aztreonam in the CSF were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) at each sampling time in rabbits with experimental meningitis caused by P. aeruginosa. They ranged from 10.2 to 14.6 micrograms/ml with the 600-mg dose and from 29 to 40 micrograms/ml with the 1,200-mg dose. Although concentrations in the brain measured at 6 h tended to be higher in infected rabbits, this difference was not statistically significant. Aztreonam therapy produced a substantial decline in CSF bacterium counts over 6 h: mean CSF counts decreased 2.4 log10 CFU/ml in the 600-mg dose group and 3.0 log10 CFU/ml in the 1,200-mg dose group. The results of this study suggest that aztreonam may be useful in the therapy of meningitis caused by P. aeruginosa.\r"

  ".W": "Since March, 1982, 33 patients have undergone cardiopulmonary transplantation. Nineteen were discharged from the hospital following the operation, and 16 continue to do well. Eight patients have survived 1 year, 5 patients 2 years, and 1 patient 3 years. Often survival has been influenced most by the selection of candidates, as no patient who had undergone a previous sternotomy survived (3 of 3). All 7 early (between 30 and 72 days) and 3 late (145 to 466 days) deaths were related to infection. Methods for ex vivo preservation of the heart-lung bloc have included storage at 4 degrees C, cardiopulmonary bypass and profound hypothermia, and autoperfusion of the heart-lung bloc. The last technique is original and currently is preferred for distant procurement. Because dehiscence of the tracheal anastomosis has occurred in 3 patients, a sutured line is now encircled with a wrap of omentum. Isolated rejection of the lung is frequent in the first three weeks following operation and has been controlled with methylprednisolone. Late survivors have shown a mild restrictive lung disorder that has not progressed between 6 and 24 months. Bronchoalveolar lavage has been useful for diagnosing infection and providing insight into the immunobiology of the transplanted lung. Although mortality and morbidity have been high, the experiences gained through this series will likely result in an improved outlook for future recipients.\r"

Agreement of 96.1% was found between negative cultures, arbitrarily identified as those with fewer than 5 logs/g, and histologic absence of invasive infection. In sharp contrast, however, histologic invasion occurred in only 36% of specimens with positive cultures. Though low tissue counts are essentially synonymous with negative histologic findings, quantitative microbiology is not a diagnostic substitute for histologic examination, since high tissue counts quite commonly do not indicate invasion. The principal value of quantitative burn-wound biopsies is the demonstration of predominant burn-wound flora.\r"

Corneal bacterial ulceration in patients wearing extended-wear contact lenses has become a problem of epidemic proportions. The designation of the contact lens itself as a suitable substratum for bacterial colonization and as a source of subsequent inoculum to compromised epithelial cells are important factors in the pathophysiology of corneal ulcer formation. We demonstrate polysaccharide- (biofilm-)mediated adhesion to two ophthalmic pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis) to the surface of a typical extended-wear contact lens in vitro using cytochemistry and scanning and transmission electron microscopic techniques. This interaction between the biomaterial and bacterial organisms, which represents a favorable self-protective environment for propagation and inoculation, is a previously overlooked area of importance in the mechanism of corneal ulceration associated with hydrophilic (soft) contact lenses.\r"

Aspirin significantly inhibited the increases in the cyclooxygenase metabolites PGE, PGD2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane but did not affect the amount of sneezing or the levels of histamine, TAME-esterase activity, or leukotrienes. The pattern of the metabolites and their response to pretreatment with aspirin parallel the response of purified human lung mast cells, supporting the notion that the early phase of allergic rhinitis is a mast cell-dominated event.\r"

Twenty three patients had a positive uptake of neutrophils in the myocardium and imaging was improved by single photon emission computed tomography. There was a significant difference between the intervals from the onset of chest pain to injection of labelled neutrophils between patients with positive and negative images; early reinjection was more likely to produce a positive image. Indeed, all nine patients reinjected within 18 hours of the onset of symptoms had positive images. The results suggest that the stimulus for activation and migration of neutrophils is transient; this is an important factor if neutrophil release products play a role in cell damage after coronary occlusion.\r"

To the HVEC monolayer human factors IXa, VIII, X, CaCl2, and S-2222 were added, and a gradually increasing activation of factor X was observed. The maximum activity of 88 nmol/L Xa/min was reached after a 12-minute lag phase. In the presence of thrombin-activated factor VIII (VIIIt) the same maximum activity developed in eight minutes, which suggests that VIIIt accelerates the formation of the IXa-VIII complex but does not influence its factor X-activating potential. Anti-VIII IgG did not affect the activity of the full-fledged complex. When anti-VIII IgG was added to the reaction mixture before factor VIII or during the lag phase of the reaction, it induced a concentration-dependent decrease of factor X activation. These results indicate that endothelial cells provide a binding surface for the IXa-VIII complex and that in the HVEC-bound complex factor VIII is protected from the effect of a specific antibody. However, the relatively slow development of the maximum activity indicates that HVEC only partially satisfy the surface criteria for the optimal assembly of the IXa-VIII complex.\r"

  ".W": "During pregnancy the plasma concentration of two different inhibitors of plasminogen activators (PAIs) increases. The only one found in the plasma of nonpregnant women (PAI1) is immunologically related to a PAI of endothelial cells; its plasma activity, as deduced from the inhibition of single-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), increased from 3.4 +/- 2.3 U/mL (mean +/- 95% confidence limits) in the plasma of nonpregnant women to 29 +/- 7 U/mL at term, and its antigen level, measured by a radioimmunoassay, increased from 54 +/- 17 ng/mL to 144 +/- 25 ng/mL. In pregnancy plasma a second PAI (PAI 2) related to a PAI found in placenta extracts was observed. Its level, quantified with a radioimmunoassay, increased from below the detection limit (approximately 10 ng/mL) in normal plasma to 260 ng/mL at term. One hour after delivery, PAI 1 activities and antigen decreased sharply, but the PAI 2 antigen levels remained constant. Three days later, the PAI 1 antigen levels had fallen to normal levels, but the PAI 2 antigen levels were still at least eightfold above the nonpregnant values. During pregnancy, the t-PA and prourokinase (u-PA) antigen concentrations increased 50% and 200%, respectively, whereas the plasminogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin levels remained constant. Despite the large variations in the levels of PAs and PAIs, the overall fibrinolytic activity as measured in diluted plasma by a radioiodinated fibrin plate assay did not change significantly. Just after delivery, a great increase in the t-PA antigen levels was observed. Three to five days after delivery most parameters of the fibrinolytic system were normal again. Our results demonstrate that during pregnancy and in the puerperium profound alterations of the fibrinolytic system occur that are characterized by increases in PAs and their inhibitors, but these alterations do not affect the overall fibrinolytic activity.\r"

  ".W": "The human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 is induced to differentiate into morphologically and functionally mature monocytelike cells by incubation with a combination of 10 nmol/L retinoic acid (RA) and various concentrations of recombinant immune interferon (rIFN-gamma). These induced cells show marked increases in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-coated erythrocyte (EA) rosettes, nonspecific esterase, and 5'-nucleotidase activity. rIFN-gamma alone at concentrations of 10 to 1,000 U/mL has essentially no effect on morphological maturation, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, and immunophagocytosis. However, rIFN-gamma at these concentrations increases EA rosetting in a concentration-dependent manner that is not affected by 10 nmol/L RA. At a concentration of 1,000 U/ml, rIFN-gamma induces moderate increases in nonspecific esterase, 5'-nucleotidase, and ADCC. These parameters are markedly increased by the addition of 10 nM RA, a concentration which alone has no effect on these markers. Based on units of antiviral activity, rIFN-gamma is tenfold more active than rIFN-alpha D in inducing EA rosettes and 40-fold more active in inducing nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and immunophagocytosis. These results, indicating that combinations of rIFN-gamma or rIFN-alpha and RA synergistically induce differentiation of HL-60, suggest that this combination may have clinical utility in the treatment of patients with certain leukemias.\r"

  ".W": "The specific thrombolytic properties of urokinase and three molecular forms of single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA) were compared in a human plasma milieu in vitro and in an experimental thrombosis model in rabbits. These scu-PA molecules included Mr 54,000 scu-PA from human urine (urinary scu-PA), scu-PA from conditioned media of a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (CALU-3,ATCC,HTB-55) (cellular scu-PA) and an Mr 32,000 proteolytic derivative of cellular scu-PA (scu-PA-32k). All four molecular forms induced significant lysis of a 125I-labeled human plasma clot immersed in citrated human plasma at concentrations between 50 and 200 IU/mL. None of the four showed absolute fibrin-specificity, but at equivalent lytic dose the three single-chain forms appeared to cause less fibrinogen degradation and alpha 2-antiplasmin consumption than two-chain urokinase. In addition, the fibrinolytic potential of the three single-chain forms was largely maintained during pre-incubation in plasma for up to 48 hours whereas that of urokinase was completely inhibited. Intravenous (IV) infusion of cellular scu-PA or scu-PA-32k into rabbits with a 125I-labeled thrombus in the jugular vein caused significant dose-dependent lysis at concentrations ranging from 8,700 to 35,000 and from 9,000 to 36,000 IU/kg respectively. Clot lysis was accompanied by minor alpha 2-antiplasmin consumption or fibrinogen breakdown. In contrast, urokinase induced lysis at doses between 20,000 and 200,000 IU/kg, but at higher doses was associated with significant systemic activation of the fibrinolytic system. It is concluded that scu-PA obtained from CALU-3 cell cultures has identical thrombolytic properties to that obtained from urine. In addition, the scu-PA-32k proteolytic derivative has the same fibrin-specific thrombolytic properties as the intact molecule. Cellular scu-PA and scu-PA-32k may therefore constitute more readily available alternatives for clot-selective thrombolytic therapy in man.\r"

Previous studies have suggested that secondary granules represent an intracellular pool of Mo1 that, upon degranulation, fuse with the plasma membrane resulting in a tenfold increase in surface expression of Mo1. To determine the intracellular location of Mo1, we monitored Mo1 expression by immunofluorescence and compared it to the release of myeloperoxidase (MPO, a marker for the primary granules), vitamin B12 binding protein (B12BP, secondary granules), and gelatinase (gelatinase-containing organelles) following exposure to various stimuli. Human neutrophils stimulated with 20 mmol/L fluoride for 16 minutes exhibited a twofold increase in Mo1 expression and gelatinase release but no enhanced release of primary or secondary granular contents. In a similar fashion, incubation of cells at 37 degrees C for five minutes with 7.5 X 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) resulted in significant increases in both surface Mo1 expression (three- to fivefold) and gelatinase release (five- to eightfold) without significant release of either MPO or B12BP. In addition, both the fluoride and FMLP experiments demonstrated that Mo1 up-modulation alone is not sufficient to activate superoxide (O2-) production. These data indicate that at least one intracellular storage pool of Mo1 is the gelatinase-containing organelles and that their fusion with the plasma membrane results in increased expression of Mo1 on the cell surface.\r"

Only five of the 50 serum samples had INF-gamma levels above background (greater than 0 less than 0.5 units per mL). Detectable levels of spontaneous INF-gamma (0.3 to 868 U/mL) were found in 18 of the 50 mononuclear cell supernatants tested. The addition of patient sera or INF-gamma positive supernatants to cultures of normal hematopoietic colonies did not result in reduced colony growth. Flow cytofluorimetric analysis of mononuclear cells failed to establish a correlation between the presence of INF-gamma in supernatants and the number of activated T cells or natural killer (NK) cells in the mononuclear cell population. However, a significant correlation did exist between the presence of monocytes and the production of INF-gamma. Contrary to previous reports, our data suggest that patients with aplastic anemia do not have high circulating levels of INF-gamma. Unstimulated mononuclear cells from some patients will produce significant levels of INF-gamma, but this does not result in decreased in vitro hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Progress in diagnostic ultrasound is driven by the development of new technology. The place of new techniques in diagnostic algorithms has to be determined jointly by radiologists and clinicians and appropriate arrangements have to be made for training. About 30 million pounds per year is currently spent on diagnostic ultrasound in the UK. Diagnostic ultrasound depends on the information obtained as a result of ultrasonic irradiation of the patient. Biological effects, some of which are undesirable, can be produced by ultrasound but there is no evidence that the exposures used in diagnosis carry any risk. In judging whether ultrasonic scanning is appropriate in any particular situation, it is necessary to consider benefits, costs and available resources. The costs include not only the costs of the test but also the cost of any hypothetical ultrasonic hazard and the cost of misdiagnosis. The most prudent use of ultrasound is that which maximises the benefit-total-cost ratio and although this cannot presently be quantified, some of the concepts involved can be understood in terms of the health increment and the health decrement, the latter apparently being equal to zero when the diagnosis is correctly made using contemporary equipment. This approach can be extended to introduce the idea of profit arising from the test. As an example, obstetric ultrasound is considered to be appropriate when there is a medical indication for it. Although routine scanning at 16 weeks of pregnancy has been shown to result in a very large profit, there is still conflicting guidance about its advisability on the grounds of safety and existing accounting systems may restrict access to the profit. In discussing the desirability of ultrasonic scanning, patients can be informed that there is no reason to believe that there are any risks related to ultrasonic exposure. The imminent availability of inexpensive ultrasonic scanners for the layman is a worrying prospect to which the medical profession should now try to develop a prudent response.\r"

Staining for sialomucins in colonic biopsies adjacent to the anastomoses was positive in 17 of 19 patients. It has been suggested that this represents a pre-malignant change. Analysis of faecal flora in 17 diverted patients and 27 controls revealed a significant difference in the carriage rate and viable count of Peptostreptococcus species. This finding has not been reported previously and the species could have a role in the aetiology of the neoplasms.\r"

Effective cystometric capacity was greater in each patient during standard cystometry (297 +/- 180 ml) than during long-term monitoring (99 +/- 100 ml; P less than 0.002). The incidence of detrusor instability was also greater during long-term monitoring than during standard cystometry (P less than 0.01). During filling, the detrusor pressure increased significantly both in standard cystometry (27.9 +/- 22.8 cmH2O; P less than 0.002) and in long-term monitoring (4.9 +/- 6.5 cmH2O; P less than 0.002). The detrusor pressure rise during filling was significantly greater during the standard cystometrogram than during long-term monitoring (P less than 0.002). Even when the detrusor pressure rise was corrected to take account of the different cystometric capacities this difference persisted (P less than 0.05). High end filling pressures are common in men with chronic retention investigated by means of a standard cystometrogram but are not observed during long-term monitoring. Such high pressures are probably due to the unphysiological rates of filling and the large volumes of fluid instilled during standard cystometry.\r"

A rise in PSA and PAP occurred in 8/65 patients (12%) during the initial induction phase. In metastatic disease prior to treatment none of these indices was significantly different between patients who attained a sustained response and those whose response was nil or only transient. Responders and non-responders could, however, be distinguished by the levels of various analytes after treatment. At 6 months the median PSA in those who responded was 2.5 ng/ml compared with 51.5 ng/ml in the non-responders. At 12 months the figures were 3.0 and 155 ng/ml respectively. The corresponding median PAP levels were 1.4 and 19 ng/ml at 6 months and 1.3 and 18 ng/ml at 12 months. The AGP:Palb ratio was also significantly different in these two groups at 6 and 12 months. PSA appears to be the most sensitive indicator of the response to treatment. The likelihood of obtaining a prolonged clinical response can be assessed within 6 months of the start of treatment.\r"

At review 3 to 6 months post-operatively, late testicular atrophy was assessed and repeat antibody studies were performed together with a hormone profile and seminal analysis. Although the duration of torsion showed a close correlation with the degree of testicular atrophy (P less than 0.001), no such association could be demonstrated between duration of torsion and subsequent sperm concentration. Twenty of 35 patients had histological evidence of a pre-existing partial maturation arrest in spermatogenesis. Fifteen of 19 with the abnormality were oligozoospermic, while all of those with normal testicular histology had a sperm concentration within the normal range. Anti-sperm antibody formation following torsion was minimal and antitestis antibodies were absent. Testes prone to torsion already show impaired spermatogenesis.\r"

These findings suggest that the transplanted atria may secrete atrial peptides and also that innervation is not obligatory for secretion of atrial natriuretic peptides to occur.

In some instances joint pain was exacerbated during dialysis. In four cases the serum ferritin concentration was raised. Radiological examination showed a few juxta-articular cysts and erosions but most affected joints looked normal. All synovial tissue examined showed amyloid, which stained immunohistochemically for beta 2 microglobulin. Large amounts of iron were present in synovial tissue from affected joints. It is suggested that the deposits of iron, rather than amyloid, in synovial tissue may be the cause of the arthropathy. Iron may be derived locally as a result of haemarthrosis or it may be a manifestation of systemic iron overload.\r"

Eight of the 27 patients received intensive chemotherapy for spread of their initial testicular cancer. Follow up biopsy studies did not detect changes of carcinoma in situ in any of these patients, and none developed a contralateral testicular tumour (observation time 12-88 months). Of the remaining 19 patients with carcinoma in situ, seven developed contralateral testicular cancer. The estimated risk of developing invasive growth was 40% within three years and 50% within five years. None of the 473 patients without carcinoma in situ detected by screening biopsy developed contralateral testicular cancer (observation time 12-96 months). No serious complications arose from the biopsy procedures. All patients with unilateral testicular germ cell cancer should be offered biopsy of the contralateral testis.\r"

Seventy six of the 94 treated ureters showed complete disappearance of vesicoureteric reflux after one injection. Eight refluxing ureters required a second injection, one required a third, and one a fourth. Six ureters showed improvement in the grade of reflux after the first injection. Two ureters did not show any change in the grade of reflux after endoscopic injection. The amount of paste injected to correct reflux in the 94 ureters varied from 0.1 to 1.0 ml (mean 0.33 ml). Patients were followed up for three to 25 months (mean 13.4 months). Follow up micturating cystograms in the 94 ureters showed absence of reflux in 83. Eleven ureters showed recurrence of reflux. Recurrence of reflux was attributed to early technical difficulties and to insufficient amounts of polytef paste used in some cases. Follow up urograms did not show evidence of ureteric obstruction in the treated ureters. Endoscopic injection of polytef paste is a safe, simple, and effective procedure for primary vesicoureteric reflux and averts the need for open operation.\r"

In one of these men, who developed the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), HIV antigenaemia preceded the onset of AIDS by more than a year and persisted throughout the course of the disease. This antigenaemia was accompanied by the disappearance of IgG antibody reactivity to the major HIV core protein p24. In none of the 12 others, who all remained without serious disease, were serum concentrations of HIV antigen detected, except on one occasion in one man. All their serum samples showed strong IgG antibody reactivity to p24. Nine children who were infected with HIV in 1981 by plasma transfusion from a single donor were also followed up for HIV antigenaemia. HIV antigen was almost constantly present in the serum (26 of 28 samples) of five children who developed AIDS related complex or AIDS and less often in the serum (four of 10 samples) of four children who remained free of symptoms. The two children who developed AIDS showed a virtual absence of antibody reactivity to p24. These results indicate that increased HIV gene expression is a contributing factor to the development of AIDS and also provide evidence for a switch from latent to active HIV infection.\r"

To assess whether total bone mass is reduced in asthma total body calcium was measured by in vivo neutron activation analysis in patients receiving various treatments for asthma and compared with results from normal controls and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica. Compared with controls total body calcium was reduced by 13.6% (p less than 0.001) in patients with asthma receiving daily oral corticosteroids but by only 9.0% (p less than 0.005) in a similar group of patients who had received oral calcium supplements at the start of their corticosteroid treatment. Total body calcium was also reduced in a group of patients receiving only inhaled corticosteroids (8.8%; p less than 0.001) but not significantly reduced in a small group of patients with asthma who had never received these drugs. When compared with controls a group of patients matched for age and for dose of corticosteroids given for rheumatoid arthritis had a similar reduction in total body calcium to the patients with asthma receiving daily oral treatment (17.7%; p less than 0.001), but no such reduction was shown in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. These findings suggest that the risk of bone loss with low dose oral corticosteroids in similar in asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Further work is required to assess the clinical relevance of small losses of bone associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids.\r"

This increase, however, did not appear to affect the severity of overdoses or the outcome. Total admission rates for self poisoning increased with relaxation of the liquor licensing laws, and since overdoses associated with alcohol tend to occur at night these impose considerable strain on casualty departments and acute admitting units.\r"

A fall in systolic blood pressure of the order of 5 mm Hg occurred during the vegetarian diet periods, with a corresponding rise on resuming a meat diet. The main nutrient changes with the vegetarian diet included an increase in the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats and intake of fibre, calcium, and magnesium and a decrease in the intake of protein and vitamin B12. There were no consistent changes in urinary sodium or potassium excretion or body weight. In untreated subjects with mild hypertension, changing to a vegetarian diet may bring about a worthwhile fall in systolic blood pressure.\r"

During the study 223 patients with eye symptoms attended, representing 2.7% of all medical consultations and giving an annual consultation rate for eye disease of 57 per 1000 of the practice population. One hundred and sixty nine of these patients were seen by an ophthalmologist who diagnosed 43 different presenting disorders; seasonal allergic conjunctivitis accounted for 21% of these cases and other disorders of the lids and conjunctiva for 28%. The general practitioner's diagnoses were compared with the ophthalmologist's diagnoses in 30 cases; the principal differences were for specialist areas of external disease, medical retinal disorders, and where ophthalmic symptoms were unrelated to ocular abnormality. A cost analysis showed that an ophthalmic service in a community health centre would be cost effective by reducing attendances at the hospital outpatient department.\r"

A study was therefore conducted evaluating a new method of imaging thrombus with platelets radiolabelled with a 111In labelled monoclonal antibody, P256, directed to the platelet surface glycoprotein complex IIb/IIIa. When the number of receptors occupied by P256 was less than 3% of the total available on the platelet surface platelet function, as assessed by platelet aggregometry, was undisturbed. P256 was radiolabelled with 111In using diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid, which achieved a specific activity of 185 MBq (5 mCi)/mg. No impairment of immunoreactivity was detected at this specific activity. Platelets were labelled with radiolabelled monoclonal antibody in vitro in two patients at a receptor occupancy of 6% and in vivo--that is, by direct intravenous injection of P256--in six patients at a receptor occupancy of 1%. In vivo recovery and biodistribution kinetics suggested that after in vitro labelling platelets were minimally activated. The 111In kinetics recorded after intravenous P256 suggested rapid and efficient radiolabelling of platelets and gave no indication of platelet activation. Of the six patients who received intravenous P256, three had documented thrombus, two of whom gave positive results on P256 platelet scintigraphy. The third subject had chronic deep venous thrombosis and was scintigraphically negative. Imaging thrombus using a radiolabelled monoclonal antibody directed to platelets appears to offer great potential as a simple, non-invasive approach to the diagnosis of thrombosis.\r"

Acyclovir significantly reduced the times to arrest of new lesion formation (p = 0.005), loss of vesicles (p less than 0.001), and full crusting (p = 0.02) in those patients entered within 48 hours of the onset of rash. In addition, there was a significant reduction in pain during treatment with acyclovir as compared with placebo (p = 0.008). Of the patients with severe pain on entry, 40% (10/25) of those treated with acyclovir had no or only mild pain at the end of treatment, whereas in the placebo group all had residual moderate or severe pain (p less than 0.001). No clinically important adverse effects of acyclovir were reported. Oral acyclovir may modify acute herpes zoster and reduce pain.\r"

One hour before their procedure 38 patients received 3 g amoxycillin syrup and 12 received matching placebo. Venous blood samples were drawn before and one and nine hours after dosing and serum amoxycillin concentrations determined using a standard bioassay. Samples containing amoxycillin had inhibitory titres measured against two reference isolates of viridans streptococci known to have caused infective endocarditis. The susceptibility to amoxycillin of one strain was high and the other low, respective minimal bactericidal and inhibitory concentrations being 0.08 and 0.04 mumol/l (0.03 and 0.015 microgram/ml) and 2.74 and 1.37 mumol/l (1 and 0.5 microgram/ml). Amoxycillin was detected in only post-treatment samples of patients given the active drug. There were no significant correlations between one or nine hour drug concentrations and age or physical characteristics, nor was there any relation to preceding food consumption. Correlations between drug concentrations at one and nine hours were weak (r = 0.34; p less than 0.05), but between corresponding drug concentrations and serum inhibitory titres there were consistent correlations (r = 0.46-0.48; p less than 0.005). Against the low susceptibility reference isolate bactericidal amoxycillin concentrations were encountered in only 20 of the 38 nine hour samples (95% confidence limits 34% and 66%). When repeat doses of amoxycillin are indicated after dentistry they should be given about four hours later, not eight hours later as commonly practised.\r"

Baroreceptors send inhibitory impulses to the midbrain and hypothalamus through the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. Since vagal neuropathy often occurs in chronic alcoholism, this might theoretically contribute to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which might in turn induce hyponatraemia. In a prospective study including 34 patients with cirrhosis a high incidence of vagal neuropathy was found in the alcoholics (64%) and a clear cut increase in the incidence of hyponatraemia in patients with evidence of vagal damage and ascites (seven of eight patients (88%); p = 0.02). Results of a retrospective study of 64 patients with cirrhosis and ascitic decompensation showed hyponatraemia in 17 (50%) of 34 alcoholics but in only four (13%) of 30 patients with non-alcoholic disease (p = 0.006). Vagal neuropathy in alcoholic cirrhosis may contribute to the low serum sodium concentrations commonly found in these patients.\r"

The total patient load (patients receiving haemodialysis in hospital and at home and those receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) varied from 12 to 270 per unit. Patients receiving acute haemodialysis or who had received a transplant were not included. The unit staffing score, on a weighted scale based on experience, varied from 6.0 to 40.5. Previous surveys have all been regionally or nationally based so criteria for assessing the adequacy of staffing in single units do not exist. This survey attempts to provide a guideline by describing the range of medical staffing compared with patient load in single dialysis units. No unit considered itself to be overstaffed, and several considered themselves to be greatly understaffed. Individual dialysis units should plead their own case in the light of their own circumstances and up to date information provided in nationwide staffing surveys such as this one.\r"

Although half of these cancers are potentially detectable by sigmoidoscopy, rigid sigmoidoscopy is not widely used for early detection, largely because of discomfort it causes patients. Flexible sigmoidoscopy has been shown to be more acceptable and more efficient in detecting cancers. In order for flexible sigmoidoscopy to be of more value in cancer control, however, primary care physicians must learn the technique and incorporate it into their complete physical examinations. This paper reports the results of a multicenter trial that evaluated the training required for non-endoscopists to learn how to use the 30-cm flexible sigmoidoscope. Instructions with plastic models, followed by an average of six supervised patient examinations, proved sufficient for them to learn the necessary skills.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple environmental factors and a multistage pathogenic mechanism appear to be involved in oropharyngeal carcinogenesis. Tobacco and alcohol are the most important risk factors, but other agents may also contribute to malignant transformation. Individual susceptibility to environmental carcinogens, although significant, is still incompletely understood. Based on our present-day knowledge of risk factors, prevention should be possible in about two thirds of all oropharyngeal cancers. It cannot be achieved, however, without both public and professional education. A rational approach to prevention of oropharyngeal cancer should start in school before habits are formed, continued throughout adolescence, and reinforced in adults. Reduction or elimination of risk factors is of prime importance. For those who cannot quit tobacco, a reduction of tar content in cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and chewing tobacco, and elimination of nitrosamines, especially from smokeless tobacco, might also help to reduce risks. Control of chronic alcoholism is more difficult, but diet supplementation, especially with proteins, vitamins, and trace metals, would decrease the promoter effect of alcohol. Control of occupational risks is of less significance. The clinician must have a state-of-the-art understanding of all known risk factors for the prevention, early detection, and control of oropharyngeal cancer. The history should review in detail exposure to tobacco, alcohol, actinic radiation, and other agents. Age of first exposure or onset of habit; duration (years); quantity of tobacco smoked, chewed, or snuffed; and its relationship with the anatomic site at risk should all be precisely recorded. Exposure to alcohol or any other risk factor should be evaluated in the same way. This review has emphasized the relationship between the various risk factors and the site prevalence of malignant lesions. Habits, customs, and cultures, as well as anatomic physiologic factors, all have a bearing on the actual target sites at which the carcinogen(s) and promotor(s) are brought in contact with the oral mucosa. Habits and customs vary widely, both geographically and among individuals. Dentists and physicians should be aware of these individual factors as they examine their patients.\r"

  ".W": "Using a decision analysis model, we estimated the savings that might be derived from a mass prenatal screening program aimed at detecting open neural tube defects (NTDs) in low-risk pregnancies. Our baseline analysis showed that screening v. no screening could be expected to save approximately $8 per pregnancy given a cost of $7.50 for the maternal serum alpha-feto-protein (MSAFP) test and a cost of $42,507 for hospital and rehabilitation services for the first 10 years of life for a child with spina bifida. When a more liberal estimate of the costs of caring for such a child was used, the savings with the screening program were more substantial. We performed extensive sensitivity analyses, which showed that the savings were somewhat sensitive to the cost of the MSAFP test and highly sensitive to the specificity (but not the sensitivity) of the test. A screening program for NTDs in low-risk pregnancies may result in substantial savings in direct health care costs if the screening protocol is followed rigorously and efficiently.\r"

  ".W": "A Southwest Oncology Group pilot study was designed to evaluate a brief, 4.5-month induction course of chemotherapy with three presumably non-cross resistant regimens in poor-prognosis metastatic breast cancer. Sixty-three patients were treated with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, plus vincristine on day 1, methotrexate followed 30 minutes later by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on day 22, and mitomycin C plus 3 days of vinblastine on day 43. All three sequential regimens were repeated once and therapy was then discontinued in responding patients. The same chemotherapy was reinstituted at the time of relapse. The overall response rate to the induction chemotherapy was 35% and included only one complete response (2%). Median response duration was 9 months. Respondents were off all therapy for a median of 5 months (range, 1-12+ months) and were followed without evidence of progressive disease. Response to retreatment was 30% with no complete responses seen. Overall median survival from the data of diagnosis of metastatic disease was 24 months, with a median survival of 14 months from the date of initiation of therapy. Toxicity for this induction regimen was moderate with two treatment-related deaths secondary to myelosuppression. While the results of this pilot study fail to support the use of non-cross resistant regimens in breast cancer, short-term therapy appears to have no adverse effect on survival and resulted in significant periods during which no therapy was given, resulting in a reduction in overall toxicity.\r"

In clinical experiments 81 patients with carcinomatous effusions were administered with MMC-CH (2.0-2.4 mg/kg in terms of MMC) in bolus intracavitarily. Fifty-one patients responded well to the MMC-CH therapy. Nineteen patients were alive for more than 6 months. The responders showed marked improvement in subjective symptoms, and 26 patients became dischargeable from hospital. Bone marrow suppression and peritoneal irritation were main adverse effects, but the symptoms were temporary and not so serious in spite of a high dose of MMC.\r"

Prophylactic brain irradiation was given to all patients. Patients with limited disease received chest irradiation at the completion of ECHO. Fifty of 52 (96%) evaluable patients responded with a complete (56%) or partial (40%) remission. The complete remission (CR) rate was higher in the control arm (66% versus 43%; P = 0.11). Response duration and survival of patients was similar for both treatment arms. Combined median survival duration for all patients with limited and extensive disease was 15.75 and 11.50 months, respectively. Combined median survival duration for CR patients with limited and extensive disease was 25 and 13 months, respectively. Administration of IVH did not ameliorate the hematologic, gastrointestinal and infectious morbidity of ECHO chemotherapy. The IVH was effective in preserving body weight and improving delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a battery of skin test antigens. Administration of intensive ECHO chemotherapy to patients with small cell bronchogenic carcinoma resulted in high response rates, acceptable toxicities and improved survival. Administration of IVH did not improve the short- and long-term results of chemotherapy, and did not ameliorate its morbidity. Nutritional support, however, was helpful in preventing patient's weight loss.\r"

The histologic nature of the sarcoma in the other two brothers was not known, but it seemed likely to be similar to that of the proband. However, the sarcomatous lesions in these two siblings developed in the patients' right lower limbs which showed clinical and radiological evidence of anterior bowing of the tibia. Their mother and two other siblings have neurofibromatosis, but have not developed malignant tumors. The unaffected father died at age 61 of carcinoma of the common bile duct. An unaffected sister developed adenocarcinoma of both colon and lung. Although it is known that patients with NF are at a high risk of developing malignant sarcoma and second primary malignancies, it is not clear whether this association is genetically determined. The family we report has some of the features of a \"cancer family\" and suggests that sarcomatous transformation in patients with NF may be genetically influenced. This report raises the possibility that the presence of congenital malformation and exposure to irradiation may predispose patients with neurofibromatosis to develop malignant schwannoma.\r"

At emergency coronary arteriography, patency of the infarct-related vessel was demonstrated in 32 of 38 (84%) patients receiving t-PA vs two of 12 (17%) receiving placebo (p less than .001). Of the 32 patients with recanalization after t-PA, 28 had a residual stenosis of at least 50% and underwent randomization a second time to immediate (n = 15) or no PTCA (n = 13). Immediate PTCA of the infarct-related vessel was successful in all 15 patients, with reduction of the residual diameter stenosis from 80.8 +/- 8.2% to 32.5 +/- 15.6% (p less than .001). The incidence of postinfarction angina (greater than or equal to 20 min of chest discomfort and reversible electrocardiographic changes) and reinfarction (documented by recurrent creatine kinase isoenzyme elevation) was reduced in the patients receiving t-PA and PTCA (2/15) compared with that in patients receiving t-PA alone (7/13; p = .006). At 1 week there was no difference in patency of the infarct-related vessel (12/15 t-PA and PTCA vs 9/13 t-PA only) or in global ventricular functional change between the two groups (0.5 +/- 10.4 SD/chord for t-PA and PTCA vs -2.1 +/- 8.2 SD/chord for t-PA only).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bone pain and local edema decreased associated with improvement of motility. CarboCT induced a slight decrease in plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion. An increase in cAMP/Cr ratio, an index of parathyroid function, was also observed (probably a manifestation of the hypocalcemic effect of calcitonin and secondary parathyroid stimulation). The whole body retention of 99mTc-MDP represents a valuable index of bone turnover, it decreased progressively and significantly on treatment. A dynamic study of local bone uptake of 99mTC-MDP was performed in eight patients. After carboCT therapy, statistically significant decreases in local blood flow, early uptake, and delayed uptake were appreciated in the involved foot. These findings lead to the conclusion that carboCT is effective in the treatment of Sudeck's atrophy.\r"

Oral lactose tolerance tests prior to the biopsy clearly separated two groups. Sixty-five percent had abnormal test results. The bone biopsies in the lactase deficient group showed more osteoid volume and osteoid seam widths on examined trabecular bone. Analysis of tetracycline-labeled bone revealed significant increases in both single, double, combined single and double tetracycline labels, and the percent osteoid labeled with tetracycline. There was no difference in the calcification rates. These findings indicate different mineralization activity in lactase deficient patients, possibly reflecting their lower dietary calcium intake.\r"

Porous titanium fiber composites were inserted into the proximal humeri and the left olecranons of all animals after the first four weeks of treatment. Upon completing a total of eight weeks of treatment, all animals were sacrificed and the bone-porous implant interfacial shear strength was determined by a pull-out test to failure. Mean shear strength of fixation for the EHDP-treated group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group (p less than 0.001). Bone ingrowth was mineralized in all of the control specimens. Mineralization of tissue ingrowth was inhibited, however, in all specimens from EHDP-treated animals. These findings suggest that cementless skeletal fixation of porous-coated implants by bone ingrowth may be delayed or prevented by the administration of EHDP.\r"

Baseline levels of IR-ANP were elevated but fell by 22% during ultrafiltration. Saline infusion induced a rapid and steep rise in IR-ANP levels which were 150% of baseline while body weight was still 2% below baseline. Changes in plasma renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone and vasopressin during the study were slight compared with the change in IR-ANP, but noradrenaline levels rose threefold during ultrafiltration. There was a significant positive relationship between arterial pressure and IR-ANP levels before and after ultrafiltration. These results lend support to the suggestion that atrial peptides are of physiological importance, especially in states of chronic fluid overload such as chronic renal failure.\r"

We have also demonstrated that this inhibitory effect of ANP on plasma aldosterone induced by angiotensin II and adrenocorticotropic hormone can be reproduced in vivo in conscious unrestrained rats. In this study, we have investigated the effect of an intravenous infusion of ANP on plasma aldosterone in conscious unrestrained sodium-depleted rats. During sodium depletion, the rise in plasma renin activity which determines an increment in the circulating concentration of angiotensin II was accompanied by a rise in aldosterone secretion as expected. ANP infused intravenously at a dose which increased the plasma concentration of the peptide three- to five-fold, produced a significant decrement in the concentration of aldosterone in plasma after an infusion period of 120 min. There was no significant effect of ANP on plasma renin activity and plasma corticosterone concentration. Since the increase in plasma aldosterone levels in sodium-depleted rats is mainly dependent on the activation of the renin-angiotensin system, we conclude that ANP may modulate the effect of endogenous as well as exogenous angiotensin II on plasma aldosterone secretion.\r"

EPC was applied to the left leg in ten patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. Two-ml samples of venous blood were obtained from the left and right femoral veins and an arm vein at baseline (induction), and then at 30 and 60 min of compression. Ninety samples were analyzed in duplicate in a single blind technique, using an assay specific for PA activity. In the control right arm and leg, PA activity levels increased at 30 min (106% and 110% of baseline, respectively), and then declined to baseline levels by 60 min. These changes did not reach statistical significance. In the leg undergoing compression, however, PA activity decreased progressively, reaching 75% of baseline at 60 min (significant at both 30 [p less than .001] and 60 min [p less than .01] as compared to baseline). In vitro, PA activity varies directly with the concentration of fibrin. The progressive decline in activity in this study may, therefore, represent a decline in substrate (molecular fibrin), as a result of increased venous blood flow. Alterations in the activity of the endothelial cell, as observed, may lead to new approaches in the prophylaxis against thromboembolism.\r"

Heart rate increased significantly (p less than .05) ventricular filling, and mean aortic pressures dropped significantly (p less than .001) after NTG injection. Heart rate and mean aortic pressure returned to control level and ventricular filling pressures increased significantly (p less than .001) after elevating patients' legs.

We found that acidosis in the stomach wall was the most sensitive predictor for complications. The specificity of this predictive test increased exponentially as the duration and degree of intramural acidosis increased. Hypotension, acidosis, and oliguria, but not cardiac index, also predicted postsurgical problems. Stepwise logistic regression analysis of the data that showed postoperative complications were best predicted by the duration of hypotension, and the predictive ability was significantly improved when the duration of intramural acidosis was included.\r"

Titration of ISDN dose to lower Paw greater than or equal to 25 percent resulted in a fall of this parameter from 32 +/- 8 to 24 +/- 5 mm Hg and was associated with a fall in mean blood pressure (96 +/- 15 to 90 +/- 14 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), systemic vascular resistance (1715 +/- 572 to 1548 +/- 414 dynes X s X cm-5, (p less than 0.05), pulmonary vascular resistance (182 +/- 106 to 154 +/- 78 dynes X s X cm-5, p less than 0.05) and mean right atrial pressure (11 +/- 4 to 7 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). In addition, ISDN significantly (p less than 0.05) increased cardiac index from 2.37 +/- 0.54 to 2.54 +/- 0.59 L/min/m2, stroke volume index from 28 +/- 8 to 31 +/- 8 ml/m2, and stroke work index from 28 +/- 11 to 31 +/- 12 g X m/m2. The ISDN dose ranged from 50 to 533 micrograms/min (mean +/- SD 326 +/- 176 micrograms/min) and could not be predicted from baseline hemodynamic values. A comparison between the effect of ISDN and NTG in doses producing comparable reduction in Paw showed similar hemodynamic changes. It was concluded that IV ISDN in patients with elevated mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure due to acute myocardial infarction results in a decrease in right and left ventricular preload and afterload and improvement of cardiac output and cardiac work. The effective dose ranges from 50 to 533 micrograms/min and cannot be predicted from baseline hemodynamic values. In doses producing comparable reduction in Paw, ISDN and NTG had similar hemodynamic effects.\r"

Patients received 5 percent dextrose solution (plus electrolytes) for 36 hours to establish standard baseline conditions and were then randomly assigned to either a carbohydrate-based (CB; 53 percent of calories) or fat-based (FB; 55 percent of calories) diet for the first week. The alternate diet was given the following week. Total calorie intake was set at 70 percent above the energy expenditure measured prior to institution of nutritional support. During energy repletion, energy expenditure was greater than predicted (116 percent) in patients with COPD and less than predicted (90 percent) in the control patients. Thermic effect of nutrients during administration of either regimen was significantly greater (p less than .05) in patients with COPD than in those without COPD during both diets. The difference between the two groups was enhanced during the CB regimen. These observations suggest that malnourished patients with COPD have an elevated resting energy expenditure, and an enhanced thermic response to nutrients as compared to malnourished patients without COPD. Increased diet-induced thermogenesis may contribute to weight loss in patients with COPD, in addition to factors previously described such as decreased caloric intake and increased resting energy expenditure.\r"

In addition, the action of increasing doses (0.05, 0.15, 0.45, and 1.35 micrograms/kg/hr) of somatostatin on resting gallbladder volume was also evaluated. Somatostatin, at the dose of 0.05 microgram/kg/hr (shown to produce blood levels similar to those measured after a meal) significantly inhibited the gallbladder contraction in response to cholecystokinin. Kinetic analysis showed that the interaction of somatostatin and cholecystokinin is of the noncompetitive type. The higher dose of the peptide (1.5 microgram/kg/hr) completely suppressed cholecystokinin-induced gallbladder contraction. In experiments carried out using somatostatin alone, a progressive increase in gallbladder volume in response to increasing doses of peptide was observed. The administration of either dose of thyrotropin-releasing hormone did not affect gallbladder emptying in any of the subjects studied. It is concluded that somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of cholecystokinin action on the gallbladder. The clear effectiveness of a very low, presumably physiological, dose indicates that somatostatin may play a physiological role in the regulation of gallbladder motor activity and provides further evidence that the peptide may act as a true hormone in man. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone does not seem to affect gallbladder motility, at least under the experimental conditions of the present study.\r"

  ".W": "We have appraised the properties of steady state calcium exchange in cultured swine granulosa cells prelabeled to isotopic equilibrium with 45Ca2+. Subsequent steady state efflux parameters were assessed by nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting to a two-compartment model. The resultant mean rate constants were 0.27 +/- 0.07 min-1 and 0.030 +/- 0.0015 min-1, which correspond to respective half-lives of calcium exchange of 2.6 +/- 0.67 min and 23 +/- 1.1 min (means +/- SD, n = 18 experiments). The estimated sizes of the rapidly and slowly exchangeable calcium compartments in ovarian cells were 1.8 +/- 0.51 and 4.47 +/- 0.15 mumol calcium/mg protein, respectively. Equilibrium exchange of calcium was temperature dependent, and accelerated markedly by putative stimulators of calcium influx, such as maitotoxin, A23187, and BAY K 8644. Conversely, presumptive inhibitors of the calcium-magnesium dependent ATPase, such as trifluoperazine and orthovanadate, significantly diminished the size of the slowly exchangeable pool and its corresponding rate constant. A similar profound reduction in the rate of slow calcium exchange was induced by a phorbol ester and by an inhibitor of intracellular calcium mobilization, dantrolene. Physiological effector hormones also altered equilibrium calcium exchange in swine granulosa cells. Thus, FSH and prostaglandin E2 increased the rapid and slowly exchanging rate constants by factors of approximately 2.2 and 1.6, whereas prostaglandin F2 alpha increased the sizes of the slowly and rapidly exchangeable calcium compartments. In summary, the present work delineates properties of physiological steady state calcium exchange in swine granulosa cells. Physiological effector hormones, such as FSH, prostaglandin E2, and prostaglandin F2 alpha, have distinct effects on steady state calcium exchange in ovarian cells.\r"

  ".W": "Growth factors have been shown to modulate differentiation of cultured ovarian granulosa cells. Transforming growth factors (TGFs) constitute a family of polypeptide growth factors capable of reversibly inducing anchorage-independent growth in normal cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), which has significant structural homology with TGF alpha, has been shown to modulate differentiation of granulosa cells in vitro. Similarly, TGF beta (TGFB) has been found to have significant structural homology with ovarian follicular fluid inhibin. To examine whether TGFB might affect granulosa cell growth or differentiation, rat granulosa cells were cultured in serum-free medium containing insulin for up to 3 days with varying concentrations of TGFB in the presence or absence of FSH. TGFB caused a dose-dependent increase in FSH-stimulated LH/hCG receptor binding, but had no effect on binding in the absence of FSH; TGFB (10.0 ng/ml) further increased FSH-stimulated LH/hCG receptor binding by 48 +/- 8% (P less than 0.02). Similarly, FSH-stimulated progesterone production was increased by TGFB in a dose-dependent manner; TGFB (1.0-10.0 ng/ml) increased FSH-stimulated progesterone production 2- to 3-fold (P less than 0.02). In contrast, EGF (10.0 ng/ml) decreased FSH-stimulated LH/hCG receptor binding by 93 +/- 1% (P less than 0.02). Neither FSH-stimulated intracellular nor extracellular cAMP accumulations were affected by TGFB treatment. However, EGF (10.0 ng/ml) diminished extracellular and intracellular FSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation at 48 and 72 h of culture. Culture protein and DNA content were not significantly affected by TGFB. These results suggest that TGFB may enhance FSH-stimulated LH receptor induction and steroidogenesis by mechanisms that do not further increase net cellular cAMP accumulation; TGFB and EGF can have opposite effects on gonadotropin-dependent differentiation; and products of the TGFB/inhibin gene family may have a capacity for autocrine or paracrine modulation of granulosa cell differentiation.\r"

The addition of 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP) or monobutyryl cGMP to the islets during a linear phase of glucose utilization resulted in concentration- and time-dependent increases in glucose utilization. Effects of the analogs of cGMP on glucose utilization were noted as early as 5 min after the onset of stimulation in the presence of 10 mM glucose. 8-Br-cGMP also increased the utilization of 1 mM glucose within 20 min. Stimulatory effects of 8-Br-cGMP were observed in the presence of cycloheximide or N-acetylglucosamine. Neither 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) nor monobutyryl cAMP induced significant changes in glucose utilization at 1 or 10 mM glucose. In the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 8-Br-cGMP, but not 8-Br-cAMP, induced a rapid change in glucose utilization. N-Methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, which activates guanylate cyclase, also stimulated glucose utilization in the presence of IBMX by 3-fold. IBMX alone did not change glucose utilization. In contrast, 8-Br-5'-GMP reduced glucose utilization, whereas 8-bromoinosine 3',5'-monophosphate and 8-bromoguanosine did not change glucose utilization. Sodium bromide did not affect glucose utilization. Glucose-stimulated insulin release was potentiated by 8-Br-cGMP, whereas insulin release from islets incubated in the absence of glucose or the presence of glyceraldehyde or 2-ketoisocaproic acid was not altered by 8-Br-cGMP. Thus, glucose utilization in pancreatic islets is modulated by cGMP, and the secretory response to 8-Br-cGMP is glucose dependent.\r"

Whereas GRF content was undetectable (less than 10 pg/hypothalamus) on day 17 of gestation, it increased to 30-65 pg/hypothalamus during days 18-20. During postnatal life, hypothalamic GRF content increased more rapidly during days 20-50 than during days 0-20 or 50-90. GRF content was 900-1300 pg/hypothalamus in 50- to 90-day-old rats, and there was no consistent sex difference during postnatal life. Hypothalamic somatostatin levels, as measured by RIA, showed a developmental pattern similar to that of rat GRF. GRF immunoreactivity in hypothalamic extracts from fetal as well as adult rats exhibited HPLC retention times identical to that of synthetic rat GRF. Administration of antirat GRF serum produced a significant decrease in plasma GH levels in fetal rats on day 21 of gestation and in newborn pups 4 h after birth. Passive immunization against GRF caused a more marked suppression of plasma GH (75-85%) 6-9 h after birth and on postnatal day 3. The results demonstrate that immunoreactive GRF is present in measurable levels in the hypothalami of fetal and newborn rats, is chemically indistinguishable from synthetic rat GRF, and exhibits biological effects as early as day 21 of fetal life.\r"

The small-sized cell population on top of the gradient consisted of 65.6 +/- (SE) 4.2% (n = 8) cells immunoreactive to antiserum against S-100 protein, a marker of folliculo-stellate (FS) cells in rat pituitary. The corresponding fraction derived from adult male or immature female rats were also enriched in S-100 positive cells but to a lower extent. Only small numbers of S-100 positive cells were found in medium- and large-sized cell populations. Coaggregating the S-100 cell-enriched populations from adult females with other pituitary cell populations resulted in a clear-cut inhibition of the GH response to rat GH-releasing factor and beta-adrenergic agents, of the PRL response to TRH and angiotensin II (AII) and the LH response to LHRH. The magnitude of inhibition increased with the number of FS cells put into the coaggregates. In perifused aggregates prepared from different gradient fractions from immature females, there was a negative correlation between the occurrence of FS cells and the magnitude of the PRL response to AII. The low responsiveness to AII in FS cell enriched aggregates was not abolished when these aggregates were redissociated into single cells. It is suggested that FS cells constitute an intercellular messenger system for local inhibitory control of pituitary hormone secretion which is not based on direct and intimate contact between the interacting cells.\r"

  ".U": "87105308\r", 
  ".W": "Continuous stimulation of cultured chicken pituitary cells with a native chicken hypothalamic GnRH, Gln8-GnRH, caused LH release, followed by rapid desensitization. Continuous exposure to calcium ionophore A23187 also produced a short-lived LH response, followed by desensitization. In contrast, continuous stimulation with a phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), caused prolonged release of LH, reaching maximum amplitude after 1 h and slowly decreasing thereafter. Cells desensitized to GnRH remained fully responsive to A23187 and TPA, indicating that GnRH-mediated desensitization occurs at a level before protein kinase C activation and calcium mobilization. Simultaneous addition of A23187 and TPA resulted in a synergistic response which was independent of the order of addition of the two compounds. Synergism was also demonstrated between depolarizing concentrations of potassium and TPA and between veratridine and TPA, indicating that calcium entering via voltage-dependent channels also synergizes with phorbol ester. Despite the prolonged action of TPA, rapid pulsatile changes in LH release could be induced in cells treated with TPA and veratridine by rapidly changing the extracellular calcium concentration. This suggest that protein kinase C could function as an amplifier of the calcium signal generated by GnRH. Synergism between calcium and TPA was blocked by trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, and W-7 [N-(6-aminohexyl)5-chloro-1-napthalenesulfonamide] at concentrations that had no effect on LH release mediated by TPA alone. This suggests that synergism is mediated via calmodulin and not a direct effect of calcium on protein kinase C.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) on the release of the endogenous opioid dynorphin from rat adenohypophysis was investigated in vitro. Rat anterior pituitary quarters were incubated in vitro, and hormone release into the incubation medium was measured by RIAs. Human pancreatic GHRH [hpGHRH-(1-44)] as well as human Leu27,Gly45-GHRH [GHRH-(1-45)] enhanced the secretion of dynorphin A1-13-like immunoreactivity (Dyn A1-13-IR) in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of hpGHRH-(1-44) that stimulated the release of Dyn A1-13-IR were about 100-fold higher than those that enhanced GH secretion. GH release induced by hpGHRH-(1-44) was blocked by somatostatin (IC50, approximately 10 nM) without affecting hpGHRH-(1-44)-induced release of Dyn A1-13-IR. GH release was elicited by prostaglandin E2, while Dyn A1-13-IR secretion remained unchanged. At concentrations that enhanced Dyn A1-13-IR release, hpGHRH-(1-44) also elicited LH and FSH secretion. The LHRH antagonist D-pGlu1, D-Phe2,D-Trp3,6-LHRH blocked the secretion of Dyn A1-13-IR, LH, and FSH induced by hpGHRH-(1-44), whereas the LHRH antagonist did not influence the simultaneous GH release elicited by hpGHRH-(1-44). A possible direct effect of GHRH on the LHRH receptor was examined in radioligand binding studies using iodinated D-Ala6, des-Gly10-LHRH ethylamide (LHRH-A). The binding of [125I]iodo-LHRH-A to rat anterior pituitary membranes was completely displaced by hpGHRH-(1-44) and GHRH-(1-45). The deduced apparent dissociation constants were about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of LHRH-A, but were close to those concentrations that enhanced Dyn A1-13-IR release. We conclude that GHRH-induced release of Dyn A1-13-IR is unrelated to GH release. High concentrations of GHRH may interact directly with LHRH receptors on gonadotrophs and thereby enhance the release of LH, FSH, and Dyn A1-13-IR.\r"

At 34 days of age, rats were divided into three groups: group 1, controls, injected with oil; group 2, treated with bromocriptine mesylate (CB-154; 250 micrograms in oil/rat X day); and group 3, subjected to the transplantation of one pituitary from an adult female rat under the kidney capsule and treated with oil. The treatments were continued for 14 days. On day 8, each of these groups were further divided into three subgroups: intact, castrated, and castrated plus T treated. T treatment consisted of injection of T propionate (TP; 50 micrograms in oil/rat) on alternate days starting immediately after castration. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture throughout the study. Plasma PRL levels were significantly reduced by CB-154 treatment and significantly increased by the pituitary graft (P less than 0.001). In intact immature male rats, hyper- or hypoPRL did not affect plasma LH levels, whereas hyperPRL reduced (P less than 0.01) plasma FSH concentrations. The postcastration increase in circulating LH levels was significantly increased (P less than 0.001) in rats treated with CB-154 24 h after castration. Moreover, the suppressive effects of TP on plasma LH and FSH levels were significantly (P less than 0.05) attenuated in hypoPRL rats. In pituitary-grafted rats, effects of castration and TP replacement on plasma LH levels did not differ from those in control rats. These results demonstrate that subnormal levels of PRL reduce the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary system to feedback inhibition by T. In contrast to previous findings in the adult rats, acute hyperPRL in immature male rats did not affect the negative feedback action of T on gonadotropin secretion.\r"

  ".U": "87105318\r", 
  ".W": "Atrial myocytes cultured for 7 days in serum-free medium secrete a 15K form of atrial natriuretic peptide (15K ANP), but isolated perfused rat hearts secrete the major circulating form of the hormone, a 3K peptide, 3K ANP. This difference was examined in the present study. 15K ANP was purified from rat atria, and sequencing analysis demonstrated that this atrial-derived ANP possessed an NH2-terminal sequence identical to that of pro-ANP; this is consistent with other reports suggesting that the major form of ANP in the atria is ANP-(1-126). Fresh rat serum was shown to cleave efficiently ANP-(1-126) to form a 3K immunoactive ANP-related peptide. Upon purification and sequencing the identity of this peptide was confirmed as ANP-(99-126); ANP-(99-126) was relatively resistant to further proteolysis by rat serum. To probe further the specificity of the serum conversion, synthetic ANP-(92-126) was used as a substrate; purification and sequencing of the immunoactive product peptide verified its identity as ANP-(99-126). Since purified thrombin and plasma kallikrein both cleaved ANP-(1-126) to 3K ANP-like material, inhibitors of these enzymes were tested for their ability to inhibit the serum cleavage of ANP-(1-126). D-Phe-Phe-Arg-Chloromethylketone (D-Phe-Phe-Arg-CMK) and D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CMK both inhibited serum ANP cleavage by over 90% at low micromolar concentration. When these inhibitors were added to the isolated heart perfusate, 3K ANP was still released by the atria, indicating that ANP processing occurs in the heart in a region not accessible to the inhibitors (i.e. intracellularly) or that the ANP-processing enzyme(s) is not inhibited by these CMK analogs and is, therefore, not related to serum-derived proteases.\r"

Dopamine (greater than 1 microL) reduced GRF-stimulated GH release, but 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; 1 mL) had no effect. The substrates for L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, L-5-hydroxy-tryptophan(L-5-HTP; 10 microM) L-dihydroxyphenylalanine; (1 mM), D,L-o-tyrosine (2 mM), and D,L-m-tyrosine (2 mM), all reduced GRF-stimulated GH release. Inhibition of the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase by benserazide (0.1 mM), carbidopa (0.1 mM), or alpha-monofluoromethyldopa (0.1 mM) did not reduce the effect of the decarboxylase substrates on GH secretion. The enzyme inhibitors had no influence on hormone secretion per se. The findings indicate that dopamine may inhibit GRF-induced GH release at the pituitary level and that the precursor amino acids inhibit GH secretion independently of the formation of the corresponding amines.\r"

In the present study, we assessed the chronic influence of selected hypothalamic factors on the relative proportions of GH- and PRL-secreting cells in pituitary cultures derived from 5-day-old rats. Primary cultures were established and incubated for 6 days in the presence or absence of 0.1-microM doses of GH-releasing factor, LHRH, CRF, TRH, or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and then subjected to reverse hemolytic plaque assays for analysis of the percentages of cells that released GH or PRL. In cultures from males, GH-releasing factor and LHRH treatment caused an increase in the proportion of PRL secretors and a commensurate decrease in the GH population. CRF increased PRL cells without affecting the GH secretors, while TRH reduced the percentages of both cell types, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide had no effect. Virtually identical results were obtained for cells isolated from females. These results demonstrate that hypothalamic factors have the capacity to induce differential effects on the proportions of GH- and PRL-secreting cells. Surprisingly, our findings also show that hypothalamic factors that do not normally influence the acute release of GH or PRL can exert a chronic effect on the proportion of cells that secrete these hormones.\r"

  ".W": "A newly established RIA was used to measure changes in the concentration of beta-endorphin in peripheral blood and pituitary tissue from adult Soay rams living outside under natural conditions and housed indoors under artificial photoperiods. A pronounced seasonal cycle in plasma beta-endorphin immunoreactivity occurred in the outdoor animals, with low levels in spring and early summer (February-May; less than 200 pg/ml plasma) and maximal levels 10-20 times higher in late summer and autumn (July-October). Seasonal changes in plasma levels of PRL, FSH, and cortisol, testis size, and body weight were also monitored; the seasonal cycle in the levels of immunoreactive beta-endorphin occurred in parallel with the cycle in plasma FSH and body weight. There were no significant seasonal changes in plasma cortisol concentrations. Marked changes in the plasma levels of beta-endorphin were also seen in rams kept under the artificial photoperiod regimen of alternating 12- to 16-week periods of long days (16 h of light and 8 h of darkness; 16L:8D) and short days (8L:16D). Transfer from long days to short days led to a greater than 20-fold increase in the levels of beta-endorphin, reaching a maximum after 4-8 weeks; the reverse switch in photoperiod led to a rapid decrease in the levels. There was no diurnal rhythm in the plasma levels of beta-endorphin based on hourly samples collected for 24 h under long and short days. The total content of immunoreactive beta-endorphin in the pituitary gland was lower in rams under short days than under long days, converse to the pattern in the blood. Sephadex chromatography of the plasma samples revealed that most of the beta-endorphin immunoreactivity coeluted with synthetic beta-endorphin-(1-31), and a small amount of activity eluted with beta-lipotropin. The seasonal and photoperiod-induced changes were largely due to changes in the levels of beta-endorphin. Extracts of pituitary tissue revealed a large proportion of beta-lipotropin to beta-endorphin compared to plasma, with no consistent change in ratio related to the photoperiod. The overall results illustrate that there are pronounced seasonal and photoperiod-induced changes in immunoreactive plasma beta-endorphin levels in the ram. Under artificial photoperiods, long days inhibit and short days stimulate beta-endorphin secretion. Under natural conditions, the development of refractoriness to both the inhibitory effects of long days and the stimulatory effects of short days may explain the timing of the annual cycle of beta-endorphin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of microtubules in the gonadotropic regulation of granulosa cell steroidogenesis was assessed at the preantral (E2-cells) and antral (PMS-cells) stages of follicular development. The influence of agents that alter microtubule-tubulin equilibrium on basal and FSH-stimulated progesterone production was determined in vitro and compared with that on microtubule integrity and organization using immunofluorescence. Basal and FSH-stimulated progesterone production was approximately 2-fold higher in PMS-cells than in E2 cells. Colchicine and nocodazole, two agents that depolymerize microtubules, significantly stimulated progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one production in PMS-cells. Although progesterone production by E2-cells was increased by nocodazole, the amount produced was considerably less than that produced by PMS-cells. FSH-stimulated progesterone biosynthesis was reduced by colchicine and nocodazole in both cell types. Taxol, an agent that stabilizes microtubules, markedly reduced FSH-stimulated progesterone production in both E2- and PMS-cells, but failed to exert a comparable effect on basal steroid production. A close association existed between the concentrations of colchicine, nocodazole, and taxol that altered basal and/or FSH-stimulated steroidogenesis and those that affected microtubule organization and/or distribution. Whereas granulosa cells appeared flattened with numerous cytoplasmic processes after 24 h of culture in medium alone, they were almost spherical and devoid of projections after culture with these agents. FSH-stimulated cells also occupied less area than controls, although cytoplasmic processes were present. These findings indicate an involvement of microtubules in the regulation of granulosa cell steroidogenesis. It is proposed that one of their roles is to facilitate the movement of cholesterol from lipid droplets to mitochondria, possibly by bringing these cellular inclusions closer together.\r"

  ".U": "87105334\r", 
  ".W": "To explore the possible role of protein kinase C and calcium in the luteolytic process, we treated luteal cells with a protein kinase C activator, the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and with the calcium ionophore, A23187. Lower concentrations of PMA could clearly mimic the inhibitory, luteolytic effects of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on LH-induced cAMP and progesterone production. A nontumor promoting phorbol ester, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, had no inhibitory effect, indicating a specific PMA effect. The calcium ionophore, A23187, also gave a marked inhibition of LH-induced cAMP and progesterone production. Hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was markedly impaired after preincubation of the cells with PGF2 alpha, PMA, or A23187, but no effect was seen when the substances were added to isolated membranes. In addition, the stimulation of progesterone production in the luteal cells with the cAMP analogs, 8-bromo-cAMP and (Bu)2cAMP, was almost totally abolished when PMA or A23187 was present. We conclude that PMA and A23187 in many ways mimic the effect of PGF2 alpha in luteal cells. The inhibition of steroidogenesis is partly dependent on depressed activity of the hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase, but also obtained by inhibiting steps distal to cAMP formation. Both points of action seem to be calcium and/or protein kinase C dependent. In contrast, higher concentrations of PMA markedly stimulated steroidogenesis without affecting the cAMP level, a stimulation not seen after incubation with 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, suggesting again a specific PMA effect. The stimulation of steroidogenesis by higher concentrations of PMA seems to be specific, but the interpretation of this finding is unclear at present. In conclusion, PMA and A23187 mimic some of the luteolytic properties of PGF2 alpha, not only inhibiting the luteal cAMP system, but also by inducing lesions in the steroidogenic steps beyond the cAMP system.\r"

Plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations peaked 4-8 days after the onset of neutropenia and were concurrent with peak neutrophil counts. The peak ACTH concentration occurred 1-2 days before or concurrent with the cortisol peak concentration. T4 and T3 peak concentrations were opposite the cortisol cycles, and maximal concentrations were seen when cortisol levels were lowest. ACTH, GH-releasing factor and TRH response tests were performed in the CH dogs. No frank deficiencies in hormone production were seen with the ACTH, GH-releasing factor, and TRH responses in CH dogs relative to those in normal dogs. It was concluded that cyclic hormonogenesis is a central feature of CH disease. These findings are the first demonstration of extrahematopoietic system cyclicity in this rare disease and suggest the presence of common regulatory factors in the hematopoietic and endocrine systems.\r"

  ".U": "87105338\r", 
  ".W": "Five groups (n = 11) of 250-g female rats were oophorectomized and immediately thereafter received daily sc injections of estradiol benzoate (EB; 0.05, 0.5, 5.0, and 50.0 micrograms) or vehicle for 28 days. A sixth group underwent sham operation and received injections of vehicle. Somatomedin-C (SmC) concentrations were determined before EB administration. After 4 weeks of EB treatment, the GH response to human GH-releasing factor (1-44) (GRF; 5 micrograms/kg, iv) was determined under pentobarbital anesthesia in seven animals from each group. Serum PRL, LH, and estradiol and plasma SmC concentrations were also measured. The GH secretory response to GRF (delta GH) was greatest in castrated animals receiving vehicle (P less than 0.05) and was significantly blunted in animals receiving 5.0 and 50.0 micrograms EB (P less than 0.05) compared to that in sham-operated animals. A significant negative correlation was observed between delta GH and serum PRL concentrations (r = -0.53; P less than 0.0001). SmC concentrations after treatment were significantly lower in animals receiving 5.0 and 50.0 micrograms EB (P less than 0.01), than in sham-operated animals and were elevated compared to those in sham-operated controls in the group receiving the lowest dose of EB (0.05 microgram; P less than 0.01). Posttreatment SmC levels correlated positively with delta GH (r = 0.58; P less than 0.001) and negatively with serum estradiol concentrations (r = -0.47; P less than 0.01). Pituitary glands from the remaining animals in each group (n = 4) were weighed and assayed for GH, PRL, and LH content. Pituitary PRL content increased with increasing doses of EB replacement and correlated strongly (r = 0.82; P less than 0.0001) with pituitary weight. In the castrated adult female rat, high doses of estrogen inhibited the GH secretory response to GRF in vivo and decreased SmC concentrations. Low dose estrogen increased SmC concentrations, although the GH secretary response to GRF in this group was similar to that in sham-operated rats. The latter observation suggests that the rise in SmC levels associated with low dose estrogen may not be mediated through a change in GH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "In sheep, parturition is associated with maturation of fetal pituitary-adrenal function, and with rises in the concentrations of ACTH and cortisol (F) in fetal plasma. We examined the hypothesis that pituitary ACTH output in response to arginine vasopressin (AVP) and CRF separately and together might change during late pregnancy as a function of fetal age. Fetal sheep were chronically catheterized, and bolus iv injections of equimolar AVP, CRF, AVP plus CRF, or saline (controls) were given on days 110-115, 125-130, and 135-140 of gestation. AVP evoked significant rises in plasma ACTH on days 110-115 and 125-130, but not on days 135-140. After AVP, the peak plasma concentrations of ACTH were attained at 5-10 min, and basal (preinjection) values were reestablished by 30-60 min. After CRF treatment, plasma ACTH rose progressively throughout the 240 min of the study. Evidence was obtained in support of an increase in pituitary responsiveness to CRF between days 110-115 and 125-130 and a decrease in response on days 135-140, when basal F concentrations were higher. The ACTH response to AVP, relative to that to CRF, was greatest in the youngest fetuses. On days 110-115 only, CRF and AVP showed a synergistic response in ACTH output, especially during the first 30 min after agonist injection. Plasma F rose in response to the changes in endogenously released ACTH in a manner consistent with progressive fetal adrenal maturation between days 110-140 of pregnancy. We conclude that in vivo the ovine fetal pituitary responds separately and synergistically to AVP and CRF on days 110-115 of gestation, but the relative role of AVP in stimulating ACTH release decreases with progressive gestational age.\r"

GRF release from incubated mediobasal hypothalamic fragments of hypophysectomized rats was decreased both basally and in response to 30 mM K+. This defect was completely corrected by prior GH treatment. The results suggest an impairment of GRF synthesis and release in the presence of GH deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "The hormonal induction of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor formation was analyzed during the maturation of granulosa cells obtained from diethylstilbestrol-implanted immature rats. In the absence of FSH, EGF receptors (as measured by the binding of [125I]iodo-EGF to the intact cells) rose by 50% at 6 h of culture, but then declined to about 25-40% of their initial levels at 24-96 h of culture. Scatchard analyses demonstrated the presence of high affinity EGF-binding sites in both freshly prepared cells and after FSH treatment. FSH stimulated a dose-dependent increase in the EGF receptor content of granulosa cells during a 96-h culture period. Concentrations of FSH as low as 2.5-5 ng/ml elevated EGF receptor levels 2- to 3-fold compared to those in untreated control cells, and 30 ng/ml FSH caused a maximal 15-fold rise. FSH increased EGF receptor levels approximately 2-fold in the first 6 h of culture and by up to 7-fold at 96 h compared to levels in freshly prepared cells. FSH treatment did not change the binding affinity (Kd = 5-6 X 10(-11) M) of the EGF receptor, but increased the total number of EGF-binding sites. The stimulatory effects of FSH on EGF receptor expression were mimicked by other cAMP-inducing ligands, including 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, and choleragen. Ligands known to inhibit granulosa cell function, including GnRH agonists and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate, reduced the stimulation of EGF receptors by FSH. However, only 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate suppressed the induction of EGF receptors by 8-bromo-cAMP. In granulosa cells cultured for 48 h with FSH, subsequent treatment with hCG for 24 h reduced EGF receptor content by 25%. Autoradiographic studies with [125I]iodo-EGF in ovarian thin sections demonstrated that EGF-binding sites were uniformly dispersed throughout the ovaries of diethylstilbestrol-implanted rats. Treatment with PMSG markedly increased EGF receptors in the outer walls of the growing follicles, while hCG treatment after PMSG caused a general decline in ovarian labeling. These results indicate that FSH maintains and increases the number of EGF receptors during granulosa cell differentiation, while LH/hCG reduces EGF-binding sites. Such changes in EGF receptors in the presence of endogenous growth factors may influence the number and selection of follicles destined for ovulation.\r"

  ".W": "Ca2+-dependent and TSH-, norepinephrine (NE)-, and A23187-induced iodide (I-) efflux from FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells is inhibited by quinacrine and trifluoroperazine, agents that inhibit phospholipase A2 activity. Furthermore, I- efflux can be stimulated by an activator of phospholipase A2 activity, melittin. Phospholipase A2 action releases arachidonic acid from phospholipids; arachidonic acid enhances I- efflux in FRTL-5 cells. Inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism via the lipoxygenase pathway, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and via the cytochrome P450-linked epoxygenase pathway, piperonyl butoxide and 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenyl valerate, but not an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway, indomethacin, can inhibit TSH-, NE-, and A23187-induced I- efflux. TSH, NE, and arachidonic acid stimulation of I- efflux in FRTL-5 cells is associated with increased iodination of thyroglobulin, which is blocked by 10 microM 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and 50 microM piperonyl butoxide. The data thus suggest that TSH- and NE-induced I- efflux from FRTL-5 thyroid cells involves lipoxygenase and/or epoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, released from phospholipids upon Ca2+-dependent activation of phospholipase A2. Since this process is associated with the iodination of thyroglobulin, TSH- and NE-induced I- efflux in FRTL-5 cells may represent the transport of I- from the cell into the follicular lumen in vivo.\r"

Whereas serum TRH PAPase has specificity for TRH, this is not the case for brain cytosol PAPase. Recent reports indicate that a brain membrane fraction contains TRH PAPase that is specific for TRH and has a remarkable similarity to serum TRH PAPase. In the present studies, a method for measuring serum TRH PAPase activity and the activities of the membrane and cytosol brain TRH PAPase enzymes are described. The effect of thyroid status on these different TRH PAPase activities was determined. In hypothyroid rats serum TRH PAPase activity was decreased, whereas in rats treated with supraphysiological doses of T4 it was increased. In contrast, the cytosolic and the membrane TRH PAPase enzymes in brain were not affected by thyroid status. It is concluded that the membrane-associated brain TRH PAPase differs from the serum TRH PAPase in terms of its response to thyroid hormone. In addition, the previously reported effects of thyroid status on rat serum TRH degrading activity are explained by the finding that thyroid hormone increases serum TRH PAPase activity.\r"

Basolateral plasma membrane vesicles (BLMV) were purified, and active Ca2+ transport was studied. The rates of ATP-dependent Ca2+-transport in BLMV from -D and +D animals were 2.6 +/- 1.0 and 10.6 +/- 0.6 nmol Ca2+/min X mg protein when cells had been isolated in citrate buffers. These transport rates were 9.2 +/- 0.7 and 9.6 +/- 0.5, respectively, when cells were isolated by vibration. The specific activities of other enzyme markers and vesicle parameters, such as the degree of resealing or purification factors, were not influenced by the cell isolation procedure. Addition of lipase and protease inhibitors to the citrate buffer or fasting the animals before death increase the active Ca2+ transport rates in BLM from -D rats to control levels. These results indicate that the ATP-driven Ca2+ pump in duodenal plasma membranes from vitamin D-deficient rats is more prone to inactivation during enterocyte isolation procedures. With the vibration technique, six populations of cells could be obtained that are sequentially released from villus tip to crypt base. A similar villus-crypt gradient of active Ca2+ transport was present in duodenal BLMV from -D and +D animals. In ileal BLMV from vitamin D-deficient rats a significantly lower Ca2+ transport rate was found compared to that in +D animals, even when villus cells were isolated by vibration. It is thought that the mechanisms by which 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 regulate transcellular Ca2+ fluxes in duodenum and ileum must be different.\r"

  ".W": "Reverse hemolytic plaque assays were used to compare the responsiveness of cells from different pituitary regions to the modulatory effects of human pancreatic GH-releasing factor (GRF), TRH, and dopamine (DA). Tissues from the peripheral rim (outer zone) and the central region (inner zone) of adenohypophyses from day 10 lactating rats were dispersed with trypsin, and the cells were placed into culture. On the following day, these cells were subjected to GH plaque assays (conducted in the presence or absence of GRF) and PRL plaque assays (performed with or without TRH and DA). Cells from both zones responded similarly to GRF with a rapid acceleration of GH plaque formation. However, the rate of PRL plaque formation in response to TRH and DA differed between cells from these regions. For outer zone cells, plaque development increased greatly with TRH treatment, but was only moderately affected by DA. Plaque formation from inner zone cells was influenced slightly by TRH, but markedly inhibited by DA. These results suggest that PRL, but not GH, cells from these pituitary regions are differentially responsive to at least two hypothalamic secretagogues. We then performed fixed sequential plaque assays to determine whether the proportions of cells that released PRL only (classical mammotropes) or those that released both GH and PRL (mammosomatotropes) also differed between the inner and outer zones. Using this approach, we found that the outer zone contained a much larger proportion of dual hormone secretors than did the inner zone. These results, when taken together with the responsiveness differences discussed above, raise the possibility that the release of PRL from mammotropes and mammosomatotropes is regulated differently and that the ratio of these two cell types may dictate, in part, the manner in which a specific region of the pituitary responds to hypothalamic input.\r"

Thin hypothalamic fragments from two separate animals were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate media. Immunoreactive TRH and C(HP) released into medium were determined by specific RIAs. Potassium and ouabain, a Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, stimulated TRH and C(HP) secretion in a graded fashion, but the magnitudes of C(HP) secretory responses were less than those of TRH. The stimulation by KCl and ouabain was inhibited by the addition of verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, or omission of Ca2+ from medium in the presence of EGTA. Veratridine, a Na+ channel activator, also stimulated TRH and C(HP) release from rat hypothalami, and this stimulation was completely blocked by tetrodotoxin, a Na+ channel blocker. The results of this study indicate that TRH and C(HP) release from rat hypothalami are stimulated by membrane depolarization in vitro and depend on Na+ and Ca2+ influx.\r"

In these animals the changes in testicular inhibin content and an index of inhibin production rate, measured after efferent duct ligation, were examined and correlated with serum gonadotropin levels. The effect of heating was not evident until after 1 week when testis weight, inhibin content, and inhibin production rate were significantly reduced and both serum FSH and LH were elevated. By 2 weeks, the maximal effects were observed, and, thereafter, all parameters gradually returned to control values (FSH: by 6 weeks; testis and epididymal weight, inhibin content, inhibin production rate, and seminiferous tubule fluid production: by 17 weeks). Throughout the study, serum testosterone levels showed no significant changes. Significant inverse correlations were found between serum FSH levels and inhibin content (r = -0.502, P less than 0.001) or inhibin production rate (r = -0.533, P less than 0.001), and these were taken as supportive evidence for the hypothesis that inhibin is involved in the feedback control of pituitary FSH secretion. Although serum LH levels were also negatively correlated to the corresponding inhibin content (r = -0.669, P less than 0.001) or inhibin production rate (r = -0.420, P less than 0.001), recent findings of Leydig cell dysfunction in these animals led us to relate the transient rise in LH to the altered state of Leydig cell function.\r"

Glycemic control was assessed by daily insulin requirement, 24-h plasma glucose profile, glucosuria, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Insulin secretion was evaluated by glucagon stimulation of C-peptide secretion, and insulin sensitivity was determined by a two-step euglycemic insulin clamp (1 and 10 mU X kg-1. X min-1) performed with indirect calorimetry and [3-3H]glucose. In the IDDM patients, the addition of glyburide produced no change in daily insulin dose (54 +/- 8 vs. 53 +/- 7 U/day), mean 24-h glucose level (177 +/- 20 vs. 174 +/- 29 mg/dl), glucosuria (20 +/- 6 vs. 35 +/- 12 g/day) or glycosylated hemoglobin (10.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 9.5 +/- 0.7%). Furthermore, there was no improvement in basal hepatic glucose production (2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.1 mg X kg-1 X min-1), suppression of hepatic glucose production by low- and high-dose insulin infusion, or in any measure of total, oxidative, or nonoxidative glucose metabolism in the basal state or during insulin infusion. C-peptide levels were undetectable (less than 0.01 pmol/ml) in the basal state and after glucagon infusion and remained undetectable after glyburide therapy. In contrast to the IDDM patients, the insulin-treated NIDDM subjects exhibited significant reductions in daily insulin requirement (72 +/- 6 vs. 58 +/- 9 U/day), mean 24-h plasma glucose concentration (153 +/- 10 vs. 131 +/- 5 mg/dl), glucosuria (14 +/- 5 vs. 4 +/- 1 g/day), and glycosylated hemoglobin (10.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 8.0 +/- 0.4%) after glyburide treatment (all P less than or equal to .05). However, there was no change in basal hepatic glucose production (1.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.1 mg X kg-1 X min-1), suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin, or insulin sensitivity during the two-step insulin-clamp study. Both basal (0.14 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.05 pmol/ml, P less than .05) and glucagon-stimulated (0.24 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.09 pmol/ml) C-peptide levels rose after 2 mo of glyburide therapy and both were correlated with the decrease in insulin requirement (basal: r = .65, P = .08; glucagon stimulated: r = .93, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Tissue content of [1-14C]2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate and blood disappearance rate of [1-14C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) were measured at nine different insulin doses and used to calculate rates of 2-DG uptake and phosphorylation in tissues from control and obese mice. The insulin sensitivity of tissues reflected in the ED50 of insulin response varied widely, and brown adipose tissue was the most insulin-sensitive tissue studied. In GTG-obese mice, heart, quadriceps, and brown adipose tissue were insulin resistant (demonstrated by increased ED50), whereas in white adipose tissue, 2-DG phosphorylation was more sensitive to insulin. Brain 2-DG phosphorylation was insulin independent in control and obese animals. The largest decrease in insulin sensitivity in GTG-obese mice was observed in brown adipose tissue. The loss of diet-induced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue as a result of the hypothalamic lesion in GTG-obese mice could be a major cause of insulin resistance in brown adipose tissue. Because brown adipose tissue can make a major contribution to whole-body glucose utilization, insulin resistance in this tissue may have a significant effect on whole-animal glucose homeostasis in GTG-obese mice.\r"

Growth hormone responses to hpGHRH 1-44 in diabetic patients with proliferative or nonproliferative retinopathy or without retinopathy were not significantly different regardless of the type of diabetes. Remarkably, GH responses to hpGHRH 1-44 in type I diabetic patients without retinopathy were significantly higher than the matched controls. Our data suggest that diabetic retinopathy in type I and in type II diabetes is not associated with increased GH responsiveness to hpGHRH 1-44, whereas in type I diabetes mellitus without diabetic retinopathy, a GH hyperresponsiveness to hpGHRH seems to occur.\r"

The effect of insulin on [Ca2+]i was 40 and 70% potentiated by ambient glucose concentrations at 180 and 300 mg/dl, respectively. Depolarizing doses of potassium (40 mM) induced an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that was also inhibited by nifedipine.

To determine the effect of increased availability of an amino acid on whole-body glucose flux and glucose carbon uptake by the human forearm, five groups of overnight-fasted normal subjects were infused with either saline, leucine (at 0.5 or 1.0 mumol X kg-1 X min-1), isoleucine (0.5 mumol X kg-1 X min-1), or threonine (0.5 mumol X kg-1 X min-1). Plasma glucose concentrations and glucose flux decreased similarly in all groups. No significant changes in forearm output of leucine carbon, isoleucine carbon, or threonine were seen during saline infusion. In contrast, during leucine infusion there was a dose-dependent increase (r = .86, P less than .001) in leucine carbon uptake with increased arterial leucine and alpha-ketoisocaproate concentrations. During infusions of isoleucine and threonine, increases (P less than .05) in isoleucine carbon uptake and threonine uptake, respectively, were observed. Glucose uptake by forearm tissues did not change during the saline infusion, but it decreased (P less than .05) in all four groups receiving an amino acid infusion. Changes in leucine carbon uptake were strongly correlated (r = -.76, P less than .001) with changes in glucose uptake. Therefore, amino acids affect glucose uptake in human forearm tissue and presumably compete as oxidative fuels.\r"

Because we have previously observed mesangial cell dysfunction in STZ-D rats, we examined whether the polyol pathway exists in mesangial cells as a possible candidate of the cause of cellular dysfunction. The activities of two polyol pathway enzymes, aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase, were clearly detected in the crude homogenate of cultured mesangial cells at higher levels than those of whole glomeruli when DL-glyceraldehyde or D-fructose was used as substrate. When cells were incubated in medium containing 55 mM glucose or galactose, a large amount of sorbitol or galactitol was accumulated intracellularly. The accumulation of polyols was effectively blocked by an aldose reductase inhibitor, ICI 128436. These results suggest that the polyol pathway exists in mesangial cells of rat glomeruli and may play a role in the development of mesangial cell dysfunction found in STZ-D rats.\r"

We attempted to ascertain whether outbred dogs would also require treatment of both donor islets and the recipient to prolong islet allograft survival. Untreated canine islets are uniformly rejected in 6-10 days in beagles. Tissue culture alone, at 37 degrees C for 7 days, or treatment of freshly prepared islets with anti-Ia monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) (B1F6 + 7.2) did not prolong canine islet allograft survival. Treatment of culture-maintained canine islets with anti-Ia MoAbs plus complement resulted in prolongation of islet allograft survival for 188 and 368 days in two of seven pancreatectomized nonimmunosuppressed beagles. The administration of low doses of cyclosporin A (CsA) intramuscularly, to recipients of untreated canine islet allografts had no effect on graft survival. By contrast, six of nine CsA-treated recipients of islets that were also treated with anti-Ia MoAbs (B1F6 + 7.2) plus complement showed prolongation of graft survival. Euglycemia was sustained for 19, 34, 89, and 300 days after the CsA was discontinued (day 30) in four of these animals. Two animals had unstable grafts from the beginning that failed 23 and 29 days after transplantation. Our results indicate that simple maneuvers like short-term tissue culture at 37 degrees C and treatment of freshly isolated islets with anti-Ia MoAbs and complement are inadequate to prevent rejection in outbred pancreatectomized beagles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Islet cell aggregates, or neoislets, can provide endocrine reconstitution for diabetic rats and enjoy prolonged graft survival when neoislets are transplanted across a major histocompatibility barrier (Lewis to ACI). Long-term survival of grafted neoislets was obtained in 71% of recipients without any immunosuppression and in 100% of recipients with minimal immunosuppression. As predicted by cell-cell recognition in rotation-mediated aggregation, neoislets apparently exclude mesenchymal cells that bear la antigens. Therefore, reduced immunogenicity is accomplished.\r"

  ".W": "An enterocolitis has been induced in guinea pigs by alloimmunisation with a mucosal protein. A single dose of immunogen fails to provoke a synthesis of precipitant antibodies, but a high percentage of animals, injected with two or more doses, develop these antibodies. A specific cell mediated immune response was already detectable 30 days after a single dose of immunogen. At later periods and after multiple doses of immunogen positive results were still found, although in a lesser percentage of the animals. The pathology was characterised by the appearance of multiple mucosal ulcerations, congestion, oedema and localised haemorrhage. The target organs were mainly ileum and descending colon. At later periods a combination of mononuclear cell infiltration, fibrocytic proliferation and granuloma formation appeared together with the other lesions. When an intraluminal challenge was made 48 hours before death, a heavy mononuclear cell infiltration was present in the contact area. The lesions appeared to extend to areas which usually remained unaffected. The characteristic immunopathology of this autoimmune enterocolitis in guinea pigs possesses some of the features of human inflammatory bowel diseases and makes it a useful model for further studies.\r"

Thirty-eight chronic HBsAg carriers with HBeAg, including 16 non-specific reactive hepatitis, 8 chronic persistent hepatitis, 11 chronic active hepatitis and 3 liver cirrhosis, who were seen at Tohoku University Hospital from 1983 to 1985, were examined. Significantly larger amounts of HBsAg, HBeAg and hepatitis B virus DNA in serum and HBcAg in liver were found in patients positive for both HBeAg/1 and HBeAg/2 in serum than in those positive for only HBeAg/1 or negative for both subtypes. These results suggest that the presence of HBeAg/2 in serum may reflect the occurrence of active viral replication. When the detection pattern of HBeAg subtypes was examined during serial follow-up for at least 1 year, three groups of patients were classified with respect to the presence of HBeAg/2, i.e., Type I, consistently positive for HBeAg/2; Type II, consistently negative for HBeAg/2, and Type III, intermittently positive for HBeAg/2. More than 80% of Type I patients were histologically diagnosed having as nonspecific reactive hepatitis, while more than 80% of Type II and III patients had more progressive liver diseases such as chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. These results suggest that the serial examination of HBeAg subtypes in serum may be important for more detailed evaluations of type B hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "There are numerous proteins of biological interest which cannot be obtained from natural sources in quantities sufficient for detailed biochemical and physical analysis. The limited bioavailability of these molecules has made it impossible to consider their potential utilization as either pharmacological agents and/or targets. One solution to this problem has been the development of recombinant vector systems which are designed to achieve efficient expression of cloned genes in a variety of biological systems. This paper will describe the development and application of a particular set of vectors which have been designed to achieve efficient expression of essentially any gene coding sequence in Escherichia coli. The system utilizes efficient phage-derived transcriptional and translational regulatory signals and provides a strong regulatable promoter, an antitermination mechanism to ensure efficient transcription across any gene insert, high stability and, when appropriate, efficient translation initiation information. In addition, a wide variety of host strains have been developed in order to help control, stabilize and maximize expression of various cloned genes. The system has now been used to express efficiently more than 75 different prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene products. The application of this system to the expression and characterization of several oncogene products will be described.\r"

  ".W": "Although echocardiography is more accurate than electrocardiography for detection of left ventricular hypertrophy, it is also more expensive, making it uncertain whether echocardiography is cost-effective for detection of this abnormality in hypertensive patients. Accordingly, the sensitivity of M-mode echocardiographic and electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy was determined in necropsied patients with anatomic hypertrophy of mild (n = 26), moderate (n = 21) or severe (n = 46) degree, and the prevalence of each degree of hypertrophy was determined in 561 hypertensive adults drawn from clinical and employed population samples. The sensitivity of echocardiographic left ventricular mass index criteria was 57% in necropsied patients with mild hypertrophy and 98% in patients with moderate or severe hypertrophy. All electrocardiographic criteria exhibited lower sensitivity: 15 to 42% for mild, 10 to 38% for moderate, and 30 to 57% for severe hypertrophy. Cost estimates from three sources were $160 for M-mode echocardiography and $48 to $64 for 12-lead electrocardiography. In populations with a 12 to 40% prevalence of hypertrophy, echocardiography was calculated to cost less than electrocardiography per instance of hypertrophy detected ($390-$1013 vs $800-$1829), yielded better separation in predicted incidence of morbid events between hypertensive patients with or without hypertrophy (3.4-4.7 vs 1.5-2.1 per 100 patient-years as opposed to 3.0-4.4 vs 1.9-2.9 per 100 patient-years), and required smaller case and control samples for hypothetical research studies (n = 254-309 vs 397-3478).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During control conditions (no inspired CO2 added), the population of PM fibers could be separated into early and late onset types based on the time of firing onset relative to the onset of whole phrenic nerve activity. Mean discharge frequencies of both types were not significantly different. Compared with late PM's, early PM's had more spikes per inspiration, fired for a longer period, and the last spike occurred later and during the postinspiratory period. Further, the mean minimal interspike interval was shorter for early PM's than for late PM's. Increasing inspired CO2 to 0.03 and 0.05 resulted in earlier firing onsets and a greater number of spikes per inspiration, particularly for late PM's. Increases in mean firing frequency occurred for both PM types. Mean minimal interspike intervals for both types of PM's showed progressive reductions as CO2 rose. For almost all of the firing properties examined in this study, responses of rat PM axons were similar to those previously reported for the cat.\r"

Acute exercise resulted in a rise in plasma beta-LPH levels that returned to base line when measured 60 min after exercise. Plasma beta-EP levels did not demonstrate any rise when measured immediately after 20 min of exercise or at 60 min after exercise. Serum LH concentrations in individual volunteers declined to nadir values 60-180 min after exercise after which they showed a rebound to levels higher than the preexercise values in three of five volunteers in whom nadir LH levels were attained before the final (180 min) measurement. Serum FSH concentrations were unaltered by exercise. Acute exercise similarly did not alter the LH/FSH response to exogenous LRH stimulation. Pretreatment of the volunteers with the narcotic antagonist, naloxone, failed to alter the postexercise or LRH-stimulated LH and FSH release. The data suggest that beta-EP does not exert a suppressive effect on LH secretion after acute exercise in normal human males. Whether the suppression of LH secretion after acute exercise in unconditioned males is due to factor(s) cosecreted with beta-LPH, an increase in brain beta-EP or to alternate mechanisms such as alteration in central dopaminergic or GABAergic tone remains to be established.\r"

The acute angles formed by the fourth through seventh ribs with an axial reference plane were measured at residual volume, functional residual capacity, and TLC in both supine and standing positions and correlated with corresponding lung volumes. both rib angles (RA) and changes in RA with lung volume were greatest with the fourth rib and decreased progressively going down (caudad) the chest. At TLC the RA of upper ribs was significantly less in EN and significantly greater in COPD than in YN. RA's were greater supine than standing. When RA information was used together with autopsy data on the angles formed by intercostal muscles with adjacent ribs, intercostal muscle lengths in hyperinflation could be calculated. Computed intercostal muscle length data suggested that hyperinflation should not be associated with degrees of intercostal muscle shortening or overstretching, that would interfere seriously with tension generation.\r"

Six control lambs were studied during normal ventilation and during hyperventilation with, and without, decreased carbon dioxide (CO2). Five lambs were given indomethacin and studied similarly. In control lambs, hyperventilation with decreased CO2 decreased pulmonary arterial pressure from 26 +/- 2.2 to 18 +/- 1.0 (SE) Torr (P less than or equal to 0.005) and pulmonary vascular resistance from 0.099 +/- 0.035 to 0.070 +/- 0.011 Torr X kg-1 X min-1 (P less than or equal to 0.015). Hyperventilation with normal CO2 did not affect the pulmonary circulation. Hyperventilation with decreased CO2 increased pulmonary arterial concentrations of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, a major metabolite of prostacyclin, in control lambs but not in the indomethacin-treated lambs. However, it affected the pulmonary circulation of the control- and indomethacin-treated lambs similarly. In conclusion, hyperventilation affected the pulmonary circulation by respiratory alkalosis not by mechanical factors and prostaglandins did not mediate its effects.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of exogenous dopamine on the development of exercise hyperpnea was studied. Using a bicycle ergometer, five subjects performed repetitive square-wave work-load testing from unloaded pedaling to 80% of each subject's estimated anaerobic threshold. The breath-by-breath ventilation (VE), CO2 production (VCO2), and O2 consumption (VO2) responses were analyzed by curve fitting a first-order exponential model. Comparisons were made between control experiments and experiments with a 3-micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 intravenous infusion of dopamine. Steady-state VE, VCO2 and VO2 were unchanged by the dopamine infusion, both during unloaded pedaling and at the heavier work load. The time constants for the increase in VE (tau VE) and VCO2 (tau CO2) were significantly (P less than 0.05) slowed (tau VE = 56.5 +/- 16.4 s for control, and tau VE = 76.4 +/- 26.6 s for dopamine; tau CO2 = 51.5 +/- 10.6 s for control, and tau CO2 = 64.8 +/- 17.4 s for dopamine) (mean +/- SD), but the time constant for VO2 (tau O2) was not significantly affected (tau O2 = 27.5 +/- 11.7 s for control, and tau O2 = 31.0 +/- 10.1 s for dopamine). We conclude that ablation of carotid body chemosensitivity with dopamine slows the transient ventilatory response to exercise while leaving the steady-state response unaffected.\r"

That study indicated that a rise in pulmonary arterial pressure was associated with a shift of pulmonary blood flow toward dorsal (nondependent) areas of the lung. This study examined the relationship between the pulmonary arterial pressor response and regional pulmonary blood flow in five conscious, standing ewes during 96 h of normobaric hypoxia. The sheep were made hypoxic by N2 dilution in an environmental chamber [arterial O2 tension (PaO2) = 37-42 Torr, arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) = 25-30 Torr]. Regional pulmonary blood flow was calculated by injecting 15-micron radiolabeled microspheres into the superior vena cava during normoxia and at 24-h intervals of hypoxia. Pulmonary arterial pressure increased from 12 Torr during normoxia to 19-22 Torr throughout hypoxia (alpha less than 0.049). Pulmonary blood flow, expressed as %QCO or ml X min-1 X g-1, did not shift among dorsal and ventral regions during hypoxia (alpha greater than 0.25); nor were there interlobar shifts of blood flow (alpha greater than 0.10). These data suggest that conscious, standing sheep do not demonstrate a shift in pulmonary blood flow during 96 h of normobaric hypoxia even though pulmonary arterial pressure rises 7-10 Torr. We question whether global hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is, by itself, beneficial to the sheep.\r"
