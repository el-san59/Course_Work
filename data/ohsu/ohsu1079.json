  ".U": "91271283\r", 
  ".W": "A simple inoculation method to induce papillomas efficiently with cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) DNA is described. Using a jet injector, recombinant CRPV DNA is easily delivered to 100 or more sites per rabbit and induces typical epithelial papillomas in approximately 50% of those sites. Papillomas begin to form by 3 weeks and continue to develop for up to 7 weeks, a pattern similar to that reported following infection with intact virus. This system readily lends itself to investigation of viral gene function by delivering mutant viral genomes into an immunologically intact host. Two mutations in the E7 open reading frame were introduced into the complete CRPV genome and analyzed by this method. One was a frameshift mutation encoding just nine amino-terminal amino acids of the E7 protein; the other was an in-frame insertion mutation at position 9. Both E7 mutations were in a region of homology to the 300-kDa protein binding domain of adenovirus E1A protein. Neither mutant construct was able to induce papillomas, thereby demonstrating that the E7 gene participates in this biologic function. Exploitation of this approach, which demonstrates that a papillomavirus E7 gene is involved in the induction of papillomas in vivo, should permit detailed studies into molecular mechanisms involved in papilloma induction, malignant conversion, and host immune response. The high efficiency of papilloma induction with recombinant CRPV DNA suggests that the jet injector can also be used to study the biologic effects of other genetic elements in rabbits or in other species.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 3 (encoded by the IL3 gene) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (encoded by the CSF2 gene) are small secreted polypeptides that bind to specific cell surface receptors and regulate the growth, gene expression, and differentiation of many of the hematopoietic cell lineages, particularly nonlymphoid cells. The IL3 and CSF2 genes have been cloned and mapped to human chromosome bands 5q23-31. Only 10 kilobases of DNA separates the two genes, suggesting that they have a common origin and/or regulation. We have cloned 70 kilobases of genomic DNA that includes the IL3 and CSF2 genes, as well as flanking sequences, and report a physical map of this region. Several unique-sequence DNA segments have been identified in this region, and one of these fragments detects two restriction fragment length polymorphisms in DNA from unrelated Caucasians. Segregation of these DNA polymorphisms was followed in the Centre Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH) panel of 40 large three-generation pedigrees, and linkage was detected with 17 genetic markers previously typed in these families. Multipoint linkage analysis permits the placement of the region containing the IL3 and CSF2 structural genes on the recombination-genetic linkage map of chromosome 5q and thereby allows the role of these genes in leukemogenesis to be more critically examined.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of cultured human tumor cells with the chloroethylnitrosourea antitumor drug 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) selectively induces transcription and protein synthesis of a subset of the human heat shock or stress-induced genes (HSP90 and HSP70) with little effect on other stress genes or on expression of the c-fos, c-myc, or beta-actin genes. The active component of BCNU and related compounds appears to be the isocyanate moiety that causes carbamoylation of proteins and nucleic acids. Transcriptional activation of the human HSP70 gene by BCNU is dependent on the heat shock element and correlates with the level of heat shock transcription factor and its binding to the heat shock element in vivo. Unlike activation by heat or heavy metals, BCNU-mediated activation is strongly dependent upon new protein synthesis. This suggests that BCNU-induced, isocyanate-mediated damage to newly synthesized protein(s) may be responsible for activation of the heat shock transcription factor and increased transcription of the HSP90 and HSP70 genes.\r"

  ".W": "Linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6) and linolenic acid (18:3 omega 3) are precursors of two series of essential fatty acids (EFA) formed by alternate desaturations and elongations. In EFA deficiency (EFAD), oleic acid (18:1 omega 9) and palmitoleic acid (16:1 omega 7) undergo the same reactions to form polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of other structures. Partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) contains isomeric 18:1 acids that can be converted to unusual isomers of 18:2 by liver microsomes. To test whether 18:2, 20:3, and 20:4 of unusual structure occur in phospholipids as a consequence of EFAD or ingestion of PHSO, rats were fed corn oil, an EFA-deficient diet, or PHSO to provide isomeric 18:1 acids. At 2.5 months the phospholipids were isolated from livers and converted to methyl esters, and the 18:2, 20:2, 20:3, and 20:4 fractions were isolated. The 18:2 and 20:2 fractions were ozonized, and, by using a computer solution of simultaneous equations, the structures and proportions of each isomer were calculated. The 20:3 and 20:4 fractions were analyzed by ozonolysis and capillary gas chromatography. When corn oil was fed, the major isomer in each group was 9,12-18:2, 11,14-20:2, 8,11,14-20:3, and 5,8,11,14-20:4. Patterns in EFAD- and PHSO-fed groups were more diverse, with large proportions of unusual isomers. Feeding EFA-deficient diet and PHSO induced measurable amounts of unusual PUFA at each step of the cascade, and these PUFA may compete in metabolism of normal PUFA and are substrates for oxidative formation of autacoids of unknown structures and function.\r"

Blood samples were taken at 36 wk, at labor, and at 6 wk postpartum. The FA profiles showed deficiencies of omega 6 and omega 3 FA (omega indicating the length of the terminal saturated chain), the latter more severe, at all three times. Mean melting point (MMP) was calculated for each sample as an index of \"fluidity\" based upon all FA present. MMP varied linearly with total polyunsaturated FA and with double bond index, current measures of \"fluidity\" and essential FA status. MMP was elevated 9-11 degrees C in plasma phospholipids of women during pregnancy and labor and postpartum. Lactating mothers showed less recovery from the deficiencies than did the nonlactating mothers, but neither approached normal at 6 wk. The changes seen in phospholipid profiles suggest a significant transfer of omega 3 and omega 6 polyunsaturated FA from the mother to the fetus. These FA are essential for normal fetal growth and development; their relative deficiency in maternal circulation suggests that dietary supplementation may be indicated.\r"

  ".U": "91271288\r", 
  ".W": "Human erythrocyte band 4.2 is a major membrane-associated protein with an important, but still undefined, role in erythrocyte survival. We previously sequenced the complete cDNA for band 4.2 and showed that the protein has a strong sequence identity with the transglutaminase family of proteins but lacks transglutaminase activity. Here we have analyzed the genomic organization of band 4.2. The band 4.2 gene is approximately 20 kilobases, consisting of 13 exons and 12 introns. Reticulocytes contain two different sized messages for band 4.2, and our results show that the major, smaller, message is produced by alternative splicing within band 4.2 exon I. The upstream region of the gene has several prospective promoter elements arranged in a pattern similar to that of two other erythroid genes, beta-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase. Alignment of the band 4.2 amino acid sequence with that of the a subunit of human coagulation factor XIII and division of the sequences into exons reveal a remarkable correspondence, and in most cases identity, in the sizes of the paired exons. Moreover, each corresponding intron of the two genes is of an identical splice junction class. These and other similarities suggest that the gene for band 4.2 is closely related to and possibly derived from that for the a subunit of factor XIII and that the proteins may share common structural and functional properties.\r"

  ".U": "91271289\r", 
  ".W": "MAR70 is a synthetic derivative of the anticancer drug daunorubicin that contains an additional sugar, attached to the O4' of daunosamine. When MAR70 was crystallized with the DNA hexamer d(CGTnACG), where nA is 2-aminoadenine, a covalent methylene bridge was formed between the N3' of daunosamine and the N2 of 2-aminoadenine. This spontaneous reaction occurred through the crosslinking action of formaldehyde. The crosslink was demonstrated by the three-dimensional structure of the 2:1 adduct between MAR70 and d(CGTnACG) solved at 1.3-A resolution by x-ray diffraction analysis. The perfect juxtaposition of the two amino groups in the complex provides a template for efficient addition of formaldehyde. This adduct structure is compared with the analogous structure at 1.5-A resolution of the complex of MAR70-d(CGTACG), in which no formaldehyde addition was observed. In both complexes, two MAR70 molecules bind to the DNA hexamer double helix; the elongated aglycon chromophore is intercalated between the CpG steps and spans the G.C Watson-Crick base pairs. The disaccharides occupy nearly the entire minor groove of the distorted B-DNA hexamer double helix. The second sugar is in contact with the sugar-phosphate backbone and does not affect the binding interactions of the daunorubicin portion to DNA. The structure allows us to model the binding to DNA of drugs having more extensive oligosaccharides. In addition, it suggests that placing a reactive (e.g., alkylating) functional group at the N3' amino position of daunorubicin might be a fruitful route for designing anticancer drugs.\r"

  ".W": "A high frequency of X-Y chromosome dissociation (95%) was found at first meiotic metaphase (MI) in spermatocytes of interspecific hybrids between laboratory mice, C57BL/6J (BL/6) and Mus spretus, compared with an X-Y dissociation frequency of only 3-4% in parental mice. The X-Y dissociation in F1 hybrids occurred before diakinesis rather than as a precocious dissociation at MI. The high X-Y dissociation was accompanied by spermatogenic breakdown after MI, resulting in male sterility. All F1 males were sterile and approximately half of the backcross males from fertile F1 females crossed with either BL/6 or M. spretus males were sterile. Male sterility was highly correlated with X-Y dissociation in both backcrosses. All of the mice with high X-Y dissociation were sterile and all of the males with low X-Y dissociation were fertile or subfertile. This correlation suggested that genetic divergence of the X-Y pairing region could contribute to the male sterile phenotype such that the BL/6 X chromosome would not pair with the M. spretus Y chromosome. The segregation of species-type alleles of amelogenin (Amelb and Amels), a distal X chromosome locus adjacent to the X-Y pairing region, was followed in backcross males that were analyzed for X-Y dissociation and sterility (we have used Amel as the designation for the mouse amelogenin locus; the current designation for this locus is Amg). A 95% concordance between Amelb with fertility and Amels with sterility was observed in backcrosses with BL/6, whereas the converse was observed in the backcross to M. spretus. These results imply that X-Y pairing plays an important role in male fertility and suggest that genetic divergence in X-Y pairing region between Mus species can contribute to the reproductive barriers between species and the process of speciation.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiological as well as biochemical evidence of recent years has established that a low plasma level of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol is a predictor for the risk of coronary artery disease. However, there is a heterogeneous group of rare familial disorders, characterized by severe high density lipoprotein deficiency, in which the predicted increased risk is not clearly apparent. One such disorder has been called fish eye disease to reflect the massive corneal opacification seen in these patients. In this report, we describe the biochemical and genetic presentation of two German fish eye disease homozygotes and their family members. Vertical transmission of a decrease in the specific activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.43) indicated that this enzyme was a candidate gene for harboring the defect responsible for this disorder. Direct sequencing of DNA segments amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that encode the exons of the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase gene led to the identification of a homozygous mutation resulting in the substitution of threonine at codon 123 for an isoleucine residue in both individuals. Family analysis in an extended pedigree was used to establish a causal relationship between this mutation and the biochemical phenotype for fish eye disease. The homozygous presence of this mutation in two phenotypically homozygous members of an unrelated Dutch family with fish eye disease further supports this finding.\r"

However, we found that the full muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) induced a robust catecholamine (CA) secretion. By contrast, muscarine, pilocarpine, bethanechol, and McN-A-343 did not elicit any secretory response. Desensitization of the response to nicotine by Oxo-M and desensitization of the response to Oxo-M by nicotine suggest that both nicotine and Oxo-M were acting at the same receptor. Additional experiments supporting this conclusion show that nicotine-induced secretion and Oxo-M-induced secretion were similarly blocked by various muscarinic and nicotinic antagonists. Moreover, secretion induced by nicotine and Oxo-M were Ca2+ dependent, and both agonists induced 45Ca2+ uptake. Equilibrium binding studies showed that [3H]Oxo-M bound to chromaffin cell membranes with a Kd value of 3.08 x 10(-8) M and a Hill coefficient of 1.00, suggesting one binding site for this ligand. Nicotine inhibited Oxo-M binding in a noncompetitive manner, suggesting that both ligands bind at two different sites on the same receptor. We propose that the receptor on bovine chromaffin cells that is coupled to secretion represents an unusual cholinergic receptor that has both nicotinic and muscarinic features.\r"

Capillary volume density is higher in hummingbird flight muscles than in mammalian skeletal muscles. Mitochondria occupy approximately 35% of fiber volume in hummingbird flight muscles and cluster beneath the sarcolemmal membrane adjacent to capillaries to a greater extent than in mammalian muscles. Measurements of protein content, citrate synthase activity, and respiratory rates in vitro per unit mitochondrial volume reveal no significant differences between hummingbird and mammalian skeletal muscle mitochondria. However, inner membrane surface areas per unit mitochondrial volume [Sv(im,m)] are higher than those in mammalian muscle. We propose that both mitochondrial volume densities and Sv(im,m) are near their maximum theoretical limits in hummingbirds and that higher rates of mitochondrial respiration than those observed in mammals are achieved in vivo as a result of higher capacities for O2 delivery and substrate catabolism.\r"

This altered binding defines the residues that are involved in the epitopes of HPr. At present, two different three-dimensional structures have been determined for HPr, one from two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and the other from x-ray diffraction of HPr crystals. The epitope mapping for Jel42 does not distinguish between the tertiary structures. However, only the HPr structure derived from two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra is consistent with a contiguous surface binding site that can be defined as the epitope for Jel44. Thus the x-ray structure may represent a partially unfolded HPr.\r"

Mapping of lambda subclones constructed from YAC-Not-42 suggests that greater than 95% (25/26 probes tested) of the yeast artificial chromosome DNA is located on the proximal (D21S65) side of the breakpoint. In situ hybridization studies using metaphase chromosomes from five acute myelogenous leukemia patients with the 8;21 translocation confirmed these results and demonstrated the translocation of probe B to the derivative chromosome 8. A chromosome walk of approximately 39 kilobases from probe B has allowed identification of the breakpoint in DNA from a somatic cell hybrid containing the derivative chromosome 8. Since probe B contains conserved DNA sequences and is in close proximity to the translocation breakpoint, it may represent a portion of the involved gene on chromosome 21.\r"

The factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also called tau, is a large, multisubunit protein (550-650 kDa) containing two polypeptides that interact directly with DNA encoding tRNA (tDNA). We have obtained peptide sequences from the 95-kDa DNA-binding subunit (tau 95) and cloned the corresponding gene, called TFC1. The gene encodes a polypeptide of calculated Mr 73,500. However, when TFC1 was transcribed and translated in vitro, the gene product comigrated with tau 95 in SDS/polyacrylamide gels. A fusion protein expressed in bacteria was able to prevent the binding of anti-tau 95 antibodies to tau-tDNA complexes. The TFC1 gene is present in single copy on yeast chromosome II and is essential for growth. Spores containing a disrupted gene germinate but only proceed through a few cell divisions before ceasing to grow. The TFC1-encoded protein contains a potential helix-turn-helix structure and an acidic carboxyl-terminal domain, a feature characteristic of some DNA-binding proteins and transcriptional regulators.\r"

We report here the results of analysis of TPR-MET expression in cell lines derived from human gastric tumors and 22 biopsy samples of human gastric mucosa showing cancer or precursor lesions. The rearranged RNA was expressed in all four cell lines as well as in biopsy samples from 12 of the 22 patients. Overexpression of TPR-MET RNA in superficial gastritis lesions with hyperplasia of glandular neck cells suggests the possible involvement of this oncogene at an early stage of gastric tumorigenesis. Analysis of gastric biopsy samples for RAS gene mutations showed base substitutions occurring in the codon 12 region of Ki- and Ha-RAS genes in four cases, including two precursor lesions.\r"

Nucleotide sequencing of a cDNA encoding a gene, which we have termed klg, revealed it to represent an additional member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, which also possesses extensive sequence similarity to the protein-tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor genes. The klg gene was shown to encode a 140-kDa glycoprotein. However, the sequence of the tyrosine kinase domain is unusual in that the aspartate residue located within the highly conserved Asp-Phe-Gly triplet is replaced by an alanine residue. The presence of this aspartate has previously been found to be essential for tyrosine kinase activity. Consistent with the replacement of this aspartate, we were unable to detect any evidence of an associated kinase activity with the klg-encoded protein. These observations raise the possibility that the klg gene product represents a newly discovered class of receptor that plays a role in signal attenuation rather than signal propagation.\r"

Structure-function relationships of the mouse cerebellar InsP3 receptor have been studied by analyses of a series of internal deletion or C-terminal truncation mutant proteins expressed in NG108-15 cells. Within the large cytoplasmic portion of the InsP3 receptor, approximately 650 N-terminal amino acids are highly conserved between mouse and Drosophila, and this region has the critical sequences for InsP3 binding that probably form the three-dimensionally restricted binding site. The N-terminal region of each InsP3 receptor subunit also binds one InsP3 molecule. Cross-linking experiments have revealed that InsP3 receptors are intermolecularly associated at the transmembrane domains and/or the successive C termini. The interaction between the receptor subunit and InsP3 may cause a conformational change in the tetrameric complex, resulting in the opening of Ca2+ channels.\r"

The phase-separation temperatures of solutions of the modified protein were measured and found to be dramatically reduced with respect to those of the native protein. At neutral pH the reagent alkylates only the cysteine and methionine residues and introduces a doubly charged phosphate anion at a maximum distance of 10-12 A from the sulfur atoms. At a protein concentration of 38 g/liter, and with 30% of the cysteines and 40% of the methionines alkylated, the phase-separation temperature is lowered from approximately 25 +/- 2 degrees C to approximately 12 +/- 2 degrees C. The ascending limbs of the coexistence curves for the native and modified proteins were determined at two different degrees of modification. The coexistence curve of the protein with 35% of the cysteines and 40% of the methionines modified shows that as protein concentration approaches the critical concentration of 289 g/liter, there is a much larger suppression of the critical temperature, from approximately 38 +/- 2 degrees C in the native protein to approximately 16 +/- 2 degrees C. Incubation of intact calf lenses in vitro with the reagent results in the suppression of the phase-separation temperature by 3-9 degrees C. These results are consistent with the view that the observed suppression in the critical temperature is due to an increase in the hydrophilicity of the protein in the vicinity of the sulfur-containing residues.\r"

In this study, digital imaging fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate these changes in response to HgCl2 treatment of cultured rabbit proximal tubular cells. Monolayer cells loaded with fura-2 were treated with 10, 50, or 100 microM HgCl2 in both 1.37 mM CaCl2-containing and nominally Ca(2+)-free (less than 5 microM) Hanks' balanced salt solution. [Ca2+]i was estimated by measuring the ratio of fluorescent image pairs (collected at 340- and 380-nm excitation), morphological changes were observed by phase-contrast microscopy, and viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. After exposure of cells to 10 microM HgCl2, [Ca2+]i initially increased about 2-fold by 5 min; after 50 or 100 microM HgCl2, [Ca2+]i rapidly rose 2- to 3-fold, peaked at 1-3 min, and then generally decreased slightly. In nominally Ca(2+)-free (less than 5 microM) medium, [Ca2+]i stabilized, but in 1.37 mM Ca(2+)-containing medium, [Ca2+]i continued to slowly rise, often reaching levels of fura-2 saturation. The rate and extent of blebbing and the rate of cell death were increased in the presence of 1.37 mM Ca2+. These results show that sustained elevations of [Ca2+]i precede both cell blebbing and cell death and that when these elevations are limited by removing extracellular Ca2+ the amount of blebbing is reduced and cell viability is prolonged.\r"

  ".W": "Type I and type II scavenger receptors, which have been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and other macrophage-associated functions, differ only by the presence in the type I receptor of an extracellular cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. Stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants expressing high levels of either the type I or type II bovine scavenger receptors have been generated. Type I and type II receptors in these cells mediated high-affinity saturable endocytosis of both 125I-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL) and 125I-labeled oxidized LDL with the distinctive broad ligand specificity characteristic of scavenger receptors. After incubation for 2 days with acetylated LDL, the transfected cells accumulated oil red O-staining lipid droplets reminiscent of those in macrophage foam cells, whereas untransfected CHO cells did not. Thus, macrophage-specific gene products other than the scavenger receptor are not required for modified-LDL-induced intracellular lipid accumulation. In transfected cells, acetylated LDL efficiently competed for both its own endocytosis and that of oxidized LDL. In contrast, oxidized LDL competed effectively for its own endocytosis but only poorly for that of acetylated LDL. This nonreciprocal cross competition suggests that these ligands may bind to nonidentical but interacting sites on a single receptor. Results were similar for transfectants expressing either type I or type II scavenger receptors. Therefore, the nonreciprocal cross competition previously reported for cultured peritoneal macrophages may not be the result of differences between the type I and type II receptors. The nonreciprocal cross competition seen in the transfected CHO cells differs from that previously observed with cultured macrophages.\r"

The inhibitors nicotine, imidazole, alpha-picoline, and 2-(4-chlorophenylthio)triethylamine lead to the simultaneous accumulation of lycopene, beta-carotene, and the one-ring intermediate gamma-carotene. The quantitative analytical values obey precise mathematical relationships: those expected from the operation of an enzyme aggregate with two cyclases equally sensitive to the inhibitors. The intermediates lycopene and gamma-carotene rejected by chemically inhibited enzymes may be readmitted to other cyclases in the wild type but not in heterokaryons containing a carA mutation. We have calculated the fraction of inhibited cyclase under each condition, the affinity constant of each inhibitor for the cyclase, and the probability that a rejected intermediate molecule will be readmitted and further metabolized. The probabilities for lycopene and gamma-carotene are identical and independent of the inhibitor responsible for the rejection. Our calculations suggest that each rejected intermediate molecule is readmitted to the enzyme aggregates two or three times on the average.\r"

The effect on contractile activity was analyzed using an antibody directed against a 20-amino acid peptide within the hinge region of myosin. This antibody bound specifically at the hinge at a distance of 55 nm from the S1/S2 junction, was specific to human, dog, and rat cardiac myosins, did not crossreact with gizzard or skeletal myosin, and had no effect on ATPase activity of purified S1 and myofibrils. However, it completely suppressed the movement of actin filaments in in vitro motility assays and reduced active shortening of sarcomeres of skinned cardiac myocytes by half. Suppression of motion by the anti-hinge antibody may reflect a mechanical constraint imposed by the antibody upon the mobility of the S2 region of myosin. The results suggest that the steps in the mechanochemical energy transduction can be separately influenced through S2.\r"

  ".U": "91271310\r", 
  ".W": "Iron increases the synthesis of the iron-storage protein, ferritin, largely by promoting translation of preexisting mRNAs for both the H and L ferritin isoforms (H, heavy, heart, acidic; L, light, liver, basic). We have recently cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA to murine ferritin H and identified ferritin H as a gene induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha, cachectin). Using primary human myoblasts, we have now examined the relationship between TNF-alpha and iron in regulating ferritin. Four lines of evidence suggest that TNF-alpha regulates ferritin independently of iron. First, evaluation of mRNA showed that TNF-alpha increased ferritin H chain specifically, provoking no change in steady-state levels of ferritin L mRNA; iron, in contrast, increased the mRNA of both isoforms. Second, the increase in ferritin H protein synthesis observed during TNF-alpha treatment was dependent on an increase in ferritin H mRNA: actinomycin D blocked the TNF-alpha-induced changes in ferritin H but did not inhibit the translational induction of ferritin seen with iron treatment. Third, equal ferritin mRNA induction was observed in iron-loaded cells and in cells depleted of iron by a permeant chelator, 2,2'-dipyridyl. Fourth, ferritin H induction by TNF-alpha and iron was additive over the entire range of iron concentrations, even at TNF-alpha doses known to maximally stimulate ferritin H mRNA levels. Nonetheless, the role of iron in translational regulation of ferritin was retained in TNF-alpha-treated cells; effective biosynthesis of TNF-alpha-induced, H-subunit-predominant ferritin protein required iron and could be enhanced by treatment of the cells with additional iron or blocked by 2,2'-dipyridyl. Finally, we observed that the TNF-alpha-mediated increase in ferritin synthesis peaked at 8 hr and was followed by a decrease in both H and L isoferritin synthesis; the addition of iron, however, reversed the late-occurring depression in ferritin synthesis. This suggests that TNF-alpha-induced synthesis of H-rich ferritin may reduce the regulatory pool of intracellular iron, secondarily inhibiting iron-mediated translation of ferritin mRNA. We conclude that TNF-alpha acts independently of iron in its induction of ferritin H mRNA but requires the presence of iron for this effect to be fully expressed at the protein level.\r"

This activity spectrum is completely different from that of the parental compounds, 9-[(2S)-3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl] [(S)-HPMP] derivatives of purines, which are active against a broad range of DNA viruses. The racemic (RS)-FPMP derivatives of adenine and 2,6-diaminopurine, termed (RS)-FPMPA and (RS)-FPMPDAP, respectively, are markedly more selective as in vitro antiretroviral agents than their 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) (PME) counterparts, PMEA and PMEDAP. Also, (RS)-FPMPA and (RS)-FPMPDAP have a substantially higher therapeutic index in mice in inhibiting Moloney murine sarcoma virus-induced tumor formation and associated death and are markedly less inhibitory to human bone marrow cells than PMEA and PMEDAP. The diphosphate derivative of (RS)-FPMPA [(RS)-FPMPApp] is a potent and selective inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase but not of HSV-1 DNA polymerase or DNA polymerase alpha. (RS)-FPMPApp, akin to PMEA diphosphate (PMEApp), acts as a DNA chain terminator. The DNA chain-terminating properties of PMEApp and (RS)-FPMPApp seem to be a prerequisite for acyclic nucleoside phosphonates to exhibit antiretrovirus (i.e., anti-HIV) activity.\r"

This learning is (i) local (in a retinotopic sense), (ii) orientation specific but asymmetric (it is specific for background but not for target-element orientation), and (iii) strongly monocular (there is little interocular transfer of learning). Our results suggest that learning involves experience-dependent changes at a level of the visual system where monocularity and the retinotopic organization of the visual input are still retained and where different orientations are processed separately. These results can be interpreted in terms of local plasticity induced by retinal input in early visual processing in human adults, presumably at the level of orientation-gradient sensitive cells in primary visual cortex.\r"

  ".W": "Female Heliothis moths normally produce their species-specific male attractant (sex pheromone blend) during scotophase, and this production is stimulated by pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN), presumably carried in the hemolymph. Several lines of evidence indicate that the central nervous system plays another critical role in this regulation. Pheromone biosynthesis was induced during photophase by electrical stimulation of the ventral nerve cord or the peripheral nerves projecting from the terminal abdominal ganglion to the pheromone gland in the tip of the abdomen. Electron microscopy further revealed that axonal branches innervate the gland tissue. Nerve branches associated with pheromone gland cells are enwrapped in glia and contain dense-core vesicles, suggesting that the innervation of the gland might be neurosecretory. Finally, the biogenic monoamine octopamine was nearly as effective as purified Heliothis zea PBAN in stimulating pheromone biosynthesis when injected into intact females during mid-photophase. Furthermore, both octopamine and PBAN stimulated significant increases in the pheromone content of the glands in isolated abdomens lacking a ventral nerve cord but only when abdomens were treated at the onset of scotophase. These data suggest that the regulation of sex pheromone production in Heliothis is more complex than previously thought. Activation of the gland appears to be governed by both neural and hormonal mechanisms, and these control mechanisms depend on photoperiodic cues.\r"

  ".W": "Loss of heterozygosity affecting chromosome 17p has been detected at high frequencies in a variety of human tumors, including cancers of the colon, breast, lung, and brain. One presumed target of these losses is p53, a tumor suppressor gene located on 17p. To our knowledge, loss of heterozygosity has not yet been reported at any locus, including p53, in human esophageal cancer. Moreover, current methods of detecting loss of heterozygosity depend on the availability of large amounts of high molecular weight DNA, making the study of small biopsy specimens or paraffin-embedded tissues problematic. We examined 52 primary human esophageal neoplasms for loss of heterozygosity affecting the p53 gene by using the polymerase chain reaction. Loss of one allele was detected in 52% of informative cases and was more common in squamous carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas. Southern blot analysis was used to confirm polymerase chain reaction-derived data. The identification of allelic loss in approximately half of the tumors analyzed supports the hypothesis that inactivation of p53 is involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Using a recombinant rsk gene product as a substrate for in vitro kinase assays, we have identified two mitogen-activated Swiss 3T3 RSK protein kinase activities (referred to as RSK kinase I and RSK kinase II, based on their order of elution from phenyl-Sepharose). Polyclonal antisera prepared against maturation-regulated 44-kDa myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase (pp44mpk) purified from sea star oocytes demonstrated immunocrossreactivity with polypeptides of approximately 44 kDa in the RSK kinase I preparation and approximately 42 kDa in the RSK kinase II preparation, respectively. These polypeptides were also recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and either phosphatase 1B or 2A (tyrosine- and serine/threonine-specific phosphatases, respectively) separately inactivated RSK phosphotransferase activity supporting the notion that tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation are required for activity. In vitro, both RSK kinases and MBP kinase phosphorylated recombinant RSK and generated nearly identical two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps. They also phosphorylated MBP and microtubule-associated protein 2 but not 40S ribosomal protein S6. Furthermore, these protein kinases phosphorylated and partially activated pp90rsk in immune complexes obtained from quiescent cells.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuroendocrine mediator found in the central and peripheral nervous system. Distinct subsets of neural, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune cells bear specific high-affinity receptors for VIP, which are associated with a guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein capable of activating adenylate cyclase. A cDNA clone (GPRN1) encoding the human VIP receptor was identified in libraries prepared from the Nalm 6 line of leukemic pre-B lymphoblasts and the HT-29 line of colon carcinoma cells. The deduced 362-amino acid polypeptide sequence encoded by GPRN1 shares a seven-transmembrane-segment hydropathicity profile with other G protein-coupled receptors. Northern blot analyses identified a 2.7-kilobase transcript of the VIP receptor in Nalm 6 and HT-29 cells as well as in tissues from rat brain, colon, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and small intestine. COS-6 cells transfected with GPRN1 bound 125I-labeled VIP specifically with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.5 nM. VIP--and less effectively secretin, peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), and glucagon competitively displaced bound 125I-VIP from transfected COS-6 cells, with potencies in the order VIP greater than secretin = PHI much greater than glucagon. VIP stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells, inducing a 3-fold increase in the intracellular level of cAMP. When the antisense orientation of the VIP receptor clone was introduced into HT-29 cells, there was a 50% suppression of the specific binding of 125I-VIP and of the VIP-induced increase in cAMP level, relative to untransfected cells. The VIP receptor cloned exhibits less than or equal to 24% homology with other receptors in the same superfamily and thus represents a subset of G protein-coupled receptors for peptide ligands.\r"

  ".U": "91271318\r", 
  ".W": "Channeling, the direct transfer of metabolic intermediates from one enzyme to another in a pathway, has received increased attention as an explanation for the high efficiency of cellular processes. The known structural organization of the protein biosynthetic machinery, and a recent suggestion that aminoacyl-tRNAs may be channeled, has led us to devise a direct test of this possibility. By employing the technique of electroporation, conditions were established for the introduction of aminoacyl-tRNAs into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We show, by coelectroporation of various combinations of free [14C]amino acids and [3H]aminoacyl-tRNAs, that whereas the free amino acids serve as effective precursors for protein synthesis, the exogenous aminoacyl-tRNAs are utilized poorly, if at all. The lack of incorporation into protein from added aminoacyl-tRNAs is not due to their leakage from the cell, to their instability, or to their damage during electroporation. Furthermore, in contrast to the findings with intact cells, extracts of CHO cells incorporate both free amino acids and aminoacyl-tRNAs into protein with similar efficiencies. Based on these observations, we conclude that the inability of exogenous aminoacyl-tRNAs to serve as precursors for protein synthesis is due to the structural organization of intact cells that leads to channeling of this substrate in vivo. Thus, we propose that endogenously synthesized aminoacyl-tRNA is directly transferred from aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to elongation factor to ribosome without dissociation into the cell fluid, and as a consequence, usage of exogenously introduced molecules is precluded.\r"

  ".W": "Genes coding for polyproteins that are cleaved posttranslationally into two or more functional proteins are rarely found in prokaryotes. One example concerns the biogenesis of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum cytochromes b and c1, two of the three constituent subunits of ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (ubiquinol:ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.2.2); the respective apoproteins for these subunits are encoded by the 5' and 3' halves of a single gene, fbcH. These two halves are linked by an extra piece of DNA encoding a characteristic signal peptide for protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. Processing of the fbcH gene product is shown to occur at a typical signal peptidase recognition site. This reaction is reminiscent of that catalyzed by the regular bacterial signal peptidase that normally cleaves off presequences from the N termini of translocated proteins. Mutational alteration of the signal peptidase recognition site within FbcH results in the appearance of an uncleaved bc1 fusion protein in the membrane. Additionally, a functional heme-binding site in the apocytochrome c1 section of FbcH is shown to be a necessary prerequisite for the formation of the bc1 complex.\r"

  ".W": "Overexpression of an activated form of the p53 protein may be involved in neoplastic transformation. We found widespread overexpression of p53 by immunohistochemical staining in 11 (22%) of 49 primary invasive human breast cancers. Northern blot analysis showed that this overexpression was not due to an increase in the steady-state level of p53 mRNA. The p53 gene was directly sequenced in 7 of these tumors with elevated levels of the protein and, in each case, a mutation that altered the coding sequence for p53 was found in a highly conserved region of the gene. Whereas 4 of these tumors contained only a mutant p53 allele, the other 3 tumors exhibited coding sequences from both a mutant and a wild-type allele. p53 mutations have previously been correlated with allelic loss of part of chromosome 17p that contains the p53 locus. Examination of all 49 breast tumors revealed a 61% frequency of deletion at or near the p53 locus. However, the presence of allelic deletion did not correlate with overexpression of the protein. Six tumors that were deleted but did not express high levels of the protein were sequenced and all retained a wild-type p53 allele. In this series of human breast cancers, overexpression of the p53 protein, not allelic loss on chromosome 17p, was always associated with mutation of the p53 gene.\r"

We investigated the nature of the mRNAs expressed in the early stages of infection when the 2 kilobase subgenomic species predominate. RNA was analyzed in the early phase of a one-step growth cycle of HIV-1 infection in T-lymphoid and monocytic cell lines by using PCR amplification of in vitro-synthesized viral cDNAs. In both cell lines, expression of Tat-, Rev-, and Nef-specific messages appeared simultaneously and could be detected within 8-12 hr of infection but in different amounts with a predominance of Nef-specific message. The Env-specific message could be detected as early as the Rev-specific message, indicating that expression of at least small amounts of the singly spliced message could occur before the accumulation of Rev.\r"

  ".W": "Axotomy of giant lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) central neurons (anterior bulbar cells) close to their somata results in ectopic axon-like sprouting from the dendritic tips. Such sprouts first appear as swellings at the tips of a small subset of dendrites 2-3 weeks after \"close\" axotomy. We report here that immunocytochemical examination of these swellings reveals a structure and composition that differs from that of conventional growth cones; incipient sprouts contain many highly phosphorylated neurofilaments (NFs), little tubulin, and virtually no stable (acetylated) microtubules (MTs). The dendrites of anterior bulbar cells after close axotomy also show pronounced changes in NF protein and tubulin staining patterns prior to the emergence of sprouts from the dendrites. The amount of tyrosinated tubulin increases greatly; this rise is tightly coupled to the appearance of highly phosphorylated NFs and the loss of nonphosphorylated NFs in the dendrites. Acetylated tubulin is generally reduced after close axotomy and is selectively lost from dendrites that gave rise to sprouts. These changes indicate that an invasion of the dendrites by phosphorylated NFs may be linked to the destabilization of dendritic MTs, and in some dendrites this may lead to a marked loss of stable MTs, which is correlated with the emergence of NF-filled sprouts from the dendritic tips.\r"

We tested whether thrombospondin, an extracellular matrix protein, modulated the spontaneous formation of cords by endothelial cells in vitro. Despite continued proliferation, a decrease in secreted thrombospondin was detected in cord-containing, as compared with subconfluent, cultures of both aortic and microvascular endothelial cells. Consistent with this trend, mRNA levels of thrombospondin decreased by factors of 16 in aortic and 60 in microvascular cultures that contained endothelial cords. Since thrombospondin was immunolocalized to fibrillar arrays that appeared to be associated with endothelial cords, we added anti-thrombospondin IgG to cord-forming cultures to limit the availability of the protein during this process. In the presence of anti-thrombospondin antibodies, there was a 33-50% increase in cord formation. These results suggest that thrombospondin is an inhibitor of angiogenesis in vitro and are consistent with its proposed roles as a destabilizer of endothelial cell focal contacts and as an inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation.\r"

The alpha-carbon positions of 241 pairs of amino acid residues that are structurally equivalent within the two proteins can be superimposed with a root-mean-square difference in distance of 2.3 A; of these, 39 residues are identical, and 56 are conservative substitutions. In addition, the conformations of ADP are very similar in both proteins. A local sequence \"fingerprint,\" which may be diagnostic of the adenine nucleotide beta-phosphate-binding pocket, has been derived. The fingerprint identifies members of the glycerol kinase family as candidates likely to have a similar structure in their nucleotide-binding domains. The structural differences between the two molecules mainly occur in loop regions of actin known to be involved in interactions with other monomers in the actin filament or in the binding of myosin; the corresponding regions in heat shock proteins may have functions that are as yet undetermined. Placing the Ca2+ ATP of actin on the ATPase fragment structure suggests Asp-206 (corresponding to His-161 of actin) as a candidate proton acceptor for the ATPase reaction.\r"

Addition of meproadifen, an allosteric effector that stabilizes the high-affinity desensitized state of the receptor upon binding to a site topographically distinct from the cholinergic ligand-binding domains, caused a major increase in labeling of the alpha subunit, a smaller increase in the delta subunit, and decreased labeling in the gamma subunit, thus revealing changes in the alpha and non-alpha subunits' contribution to cholinergic ligand binding. Also, in agreement with the tighter binding of cholinergic ligands to the desensitized receptor, differential labeling of three peptide loops of the alpha subunit was detected: while Tyr-190, Cys-192, and Cys-193 were labeled in a roughly identical manner in both resting and desensitized conformations, the labeling of Tyr-93 and Trp-149 increased up to 6-fold in the desensitized state. Tyr-93 and Trp-149 belong to separate regions containing strictly conserved \"canonical\" amino acids, common to all nicotinic, gamma-aminobutyrate, and glycine receptor subunits. These regions are thus likely to play a critical role in the regulation of ligand-gated ion channels.\r"

  ".U": "91271330\r", 
  ".W": "In a variety of nerve cells of the brain, action potentials activate gene expression by means of Ca2+ influx. To determine how Ca2+ influx alters gene expression, we have examined the pattern of phosphorylation of a protein that binds to the cAMP response element (CRE). We have found that purified bovine brain CRE-binding protein is a substrate for the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (Cam kinase) as it is for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (kinase A). Tryptic peptide maps show that the same peptide is phosphorylated in vitro both by kinase A and by Cam kinase. Moreover, in vitro transcription assays using a CRE-containing c-fos promoter indicate that phosphorylation of CRE-binding protein by Cam kinase increases gene transcription. Thus, action potentials in nerve cells and the consequent influx of Ca2+ can activate CRE-binding proteins by means of Cam kinase. This kinase therefore provides a direct second-messenger pathway by which impulse activity at the membrane can influence gene transcription. This has been shown independently by Sheng et al. (Sheng, M., Thomson, M. A. & Greenberg, M. E. (1991) Science, in press), who found that depolarization and Ca2+ influx mediate induction of c-fos in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells through phosphorylation of CRE-binding protein. These several findings indicate that CRE-binding protein(s) is a convergence point for synaptic activity acting through kinase A and impulse activity acting through Cam kinase. Together the two kinases could activate transcription in a synergistic manner, which could allow CRE-binding protein to couple short-term to long-term associative forms of synaptic plasticity.\r"

LAP267 is temperature-sensitive, activating expression at 32 degrees C but not at 39.5 degrees C. It is allosterically regulated in a manner opposite that of wild-type lac repressor, in that LAP267 activity is rescued at the nonpermissive temperature by isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Stable mouse cell lines containing both the LAP267 gene and a LAP-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene were readily established and exhibited up to a 1200-fold increase in CAT activity within 24 hr upon addition of IPTG. Thus, LAP267 is a powerful inducible switch in mammalian cells, imparting a regulatory stringency similar to that observed with lac repressor in Escherichia coli.\r"

  ".U": "91271333\r", 
  ".W": "The high-affinity receptor for human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) is composed of two subunits, alpha and beta. The alpha subunit binds GM-CSF with low affinity, whereas the beta subunit does not bind GM-CSF by itself. The alpha and beta subunits together form the high-affinity GM-CSF receptor. The beta subunit has extensive sequence homology with the mouse interleukin 3 (IL-3) receptor (AIC2A) and its homologue (AIC2B) that does not bind IL-3 or other cytokines including GM-CSF. To examine the function of these receptor components, we expressed the alpha subunit of the hGM-CSF receptor with the human beta subunit or the mouse AIC2A or AIC2B in a mouse IL-3-dependent pro-B-cell line, Ba/F3, and in a mouse IL-2-dependent T-cell line, CTLL2. Coexpression of the alpha and beta subunits in Ba/F3 and CTLL2 cells resulted in high-affinity hGM-CSF binding and growth response to low concentrations of hGM-CSF. Whereas Ba/F3 cells expressing the alpha subunit alone proliferated in response to high concentrations of hGM-CSF, CTLL2 cells expressing the alpha subunit alone did not respond to hGM-CSF at all. Since Ba/F3 cells express endogenous AIC2A and AIC2B whereas CTLL2 expresses neither of them, we examined the possibility that either AIC2A or AIC2B is involved in the formation of a functional GM-CSF receptor. The expression of the human alpha subunit with AIC2B, but not with AIC2A, in CTLL2 cells conferred a growth response to hGM-CSF. These results indicate that the beta subunit of the GM-CSF receptor is required for generation of growth signals and that AIC2B is likely the beta subunit of the mouse GM-CSF receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Herpes simplex virus 1 attaches to at least two cell surface receptors. In polarized epithelial (Madin-Darby canine kidney; MDCK) cells one receptor is located in the apical surface and attachment to the cells requires the presence of glycoprotein C in the virus. The second receptor is located in the basal surface and does not require the presence of glycoprotein C. Exposure of MDCK cells at either the apical or basal surface to wild-type virus yields plaques and viral products whereas infection by a glycoprotein C-negative mutant yields identical results only after exposure of MDCK cells to virus at the basal surface. Multiple receptors for viral entry into cells expand the host range of the virus. The observation that glycoprotein C-negative mutants are infectious in many nonpolarized cell lines suggests that cells in culture may express more than one receptor and explains why genes that specify the viral proteins that recognize redundant receptors, like glycoprotein C, are expendable.\r"

  ".U": "91271335\r", 
  ".W": "Voltage-activated K+ channels are a family of closely related membrane proteins that differ in their gating behavior, conductance, and pharmacology. A prominent and physiologically important difference among K+ channels is their rate of inactivation. Inactivation rates range from milliseconds to seconds, and K+ channels with different inactivation properties have very different effects on signal integration and repetitive firing properties of neurons. The cloned Shaker B (H4) potassium channel is an example of a K+ channel that inactivates in a few milliseconds. Recent experiments have shown that removal of an N-terminal region of the Shaker protein by site-directed deletion practically abolishes this fast inactivation, but the modified channel does still inactivate during a prolonged depolarization lasting many seconds. Here we report that this remnant inactivation must occur by a distinct mechanism from the rapid inactivation of the wild-type Shaker channel. Like the inactivation of another K+ channel [Grissmer, S. & Calahan, M. (1989) Biophys. J. 55, 203-206], this slow inactivation is retarded by the application of a channel blocker, tetraethylammonium, to the extracellular side of the channel. By contrast, the fast inactivation of the wild-type Shaker channel is sensitive only to intracellular application of tetraethylammonium. Intracellular tetraethylammonium slows down the fast inactivation process, as though it competes with the binding of the inactivation particle.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are occupied by peptides of endogenously synthesized self proteins. Since graft rejection appears to be mediated by the normal occurrence of high frequencies of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for allogeneic MHC molecules, it is important to know if such CTLs recognize specific MHC-peptide complexes (as opposed to the MHC molecule per se) and, if so, whether allorecognition is the result of the recognition of a limited spectrum of antigenic determinants or, alternatively, the recognition of a diverse array of MHC-self peptide complexes. This issue has been examined using a mutant cell line, T2Kb, that expresses class I molecules devoid of endogenously derived peptides. This cell line was not recognized by Kb-specific alloreactive CTLs. However, upon exposure to peptides derived by cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytoplasmic proteins these cells became sensitized for recognition and lysis by a majority of the CTL clones examined. Reverse-phase HPLC fractionation of the heterogeneous cell-derived peptides revealed that individual CTL clones were specific for different peptide antigen(s). Thus, the high frequency of alloreactive T cells that is responsible for graft rejection appears to represent the sum of numerous T-cell clones specific for a diverse array of endogenous peptide antigens presented in the context of allogeneic class I molecules.\r"

  ".U": "91271338\r", 
  ".W": "Transcription factors are rapidly and transiently induced in brain by excitatory stimuli and may be important in coordinating changes in gene expression underlying neuronal plasticity. In contrast to their transient induction after stimulation, certain transcription factors display stable, relatively high basal levels of expression in brain. Here we demonstrate that this \"constitutive\" expression of the transcription factor zif268 in cortex is driven by natural synaptic activity. Blockade of afferent visual activity with intraocular injections of tetrodotoxin results in rapid, dramatic reductions of Zif268 mRNA and immunoreactivity in visual cortex. Moreover, dark-adaptation for several days lowers zif268 expression in visual cortex, and expression rapidly returns to control levels upon subsequent light exposure. Several other transcription factors, which are induced in cortical neurons by excitatory stimuli, appear less responsive to changes in natural sensory input. These studies suggest that transcription factors play a role not only in responses to artificial stimuli but also in the normal maintenance of cortical physiology. Anatomic markers for zif268 may be useful in mapping normal cortical activity in brain.\r"

  ".W": "It has been recognized since ancient times that malaria fever is highly periodic but the mechanism has been poorly understood. Malaria fever is related to the parasite growth cycle in erythrocytes. After a fixed period of replication, a mature parasite (schizont) causes the infected erythrocyte to rupture, releasing progeny that quickly invade other erythrocytes. Simultaneous rupture of a large number of schizonts stimulates a host fever response. Febrile temperatures are damaging to Plasmodium falciparum, particularly in the second half of its 48-hr replicative cycle. Using a mathematical model, we show that these interactions naturally tend to generate periodic fever. The model predicts chaotic parasite population dynamics at high multiplication rates, consistent with the classical observation that P. falciparum causes less regular fever than other species of parasite.\r"

The field population proved resistant (greater than 200-fold compared with the laboratory strain) to CryIA(b), one of the crystal proteins in the insecticidal formulation. Binding studies showed that the two strains differ in a membrane receptor that recognizes CryIA(b). This crystal protein did not bind to the brush-border membrane of the midgut epithelial cells of the field population, either because of strongly reduced binding affinity or because of the complete absence of the receptor molecule. Both strains proved fully susceptible to the CryIB and CryIC crystal proteins, which were not present in the B. thuringiensis formulation used in the field. Characteristics of CryIB and CryIC binding to brush-border membranes of midgut epithelial cells were virtually identical in the laboratory and the field population.\r"

This is puzzling (because P. falciparum is known to have a sexual stage) and poses a challenge that can be readily settled by ascertaining the frequency distribution of genotypes in natural populations.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether mononuclear cell secretory products contribute to the changes in bone turnover that characterize the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis, we evaluated the effects of oophorectomy and subsequent estrogen replacement on the spontaneous secretion of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and on the phytohemagglutinin A-induced secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In 15 healthy premenopausal women who underwent oophorectomy, increases in GM-CSF activity were observed as early as 1 week after surgery, whereas elevations in IL-1 and TNF-alpha and in hydroxyproline/creatinine and calcium/creatinine ratios, two urinary indices of bone resorption, were detectable 2 weeks after the surgical procedure. Six of the oophorectomized women received no estrogen therapy after surgery and in these subjects hydroxyproline/creatinine and calcium/creatinine ratios plateaued 6 weeks postoperatively, and all three cytokines reached the highest levels 8 weeks after oophorectomy, when the study ended. In the remaining 9 women, who were started on estrogen replacement therapy 4 weeks after oophorectomy, decreases in the indices of bone resorption paralleled decreases in the secretion of the cytokines, with lower levels detected after 2 weeks of therapy. In the women who did not receive estrogen therapy, circulating osteocalcin, a marker of bone formation, increased beyond preoperative levels 8 weeks after oophorectomy, whereas in the estrogen-treated subjects osteocalcin remained unchanged in the entire study period. In 9 female controls who underwent simple hysterectomy, cytokine release and biochemical indices of bone turnover did not change after surgery. These data indicate that changes in estrogen status in vivo are associated with the secretion of mononuclear cell immune factors in vitro and suggest that alterations in the local production of bone-acting cytokines may underlie changes in bone turnover caused by surgically induced menopause and estrogen replacement.\r"

Evidence is presented that dengue virus recovered from permissive cells transfected with the in vitro RNA transcripts retained a mutation that was engineered into full-length cDNA. The properties of the virus produced by cells transfected with infectious RNA transcripts of dengue cDNA resembled those of the virus from which the cDNA clone was derived.

The significance of this event is uncertain; cleaved NGF demonstrates bioactivity and no function has been attributed to the octapeptide produced (NGF-OP; Ser-Ser-Thr-His-Pro-Val-Phe-His). Enzyme inhibition studies indicating structural relatedness of NGF-OP and bradykinin (BK) prompted us to determine whether NGF-OP would elicit BK-like actions. We found that like BK, NGF-OP induced a decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold (i.e., produced hyperalgesia) in the hairy skin of the rat. This effect was dose-dependent and sequence-specific; like BK it was attenuated by sympathectomy and indomethacin pretreatment. However, NGF-OP actions appeared to be distinct from those for BK in that tissue injury was required for NGF-OP to induce hyperalgesia. Furthermore, we found no evidence that NGF-OP bound to or activated BK receptors. Our data indicate that NGF-OP is a distinct mediator of hyperalgesia. We suggest that NGF-OP alters pain threshold in the injured target regions of NGF-responsive neurons.\r"

  ".W": "The standard enthalpy or entropy change upon transfer of a small nonpolar molecule from a nonaqueous phase into water at a given temperature is generally different for different solute species. However, if the heat capacity change is independent of temperature, there exists a temperature at which the enthalpy or the entropy change becomes the same for all solute species within a given class. Similarly, the enthalpy or the entropy change of protein denaturation, when extrapolated to high temperature assuming a temperature-independent heat capacity change, shows a temperature at which its value becomes the same for many different globular proteins on a per weight basis. It is shown that the existence of these temperatures can be explained from a common formalism based on a linear relationship between the thermodynamic quantity and a temperature-independent molecular property that characterizes the solute or the protein. For the small nonpolar molecule transfer processes, this property is the surface area or the number of groups that are brought in contact with water. For protein denaturation, it is suggested that this property measures the polar/nonpolar mix of the internal interaction within the protein interior. Under a certain set of assumptions, this model leads to the conclusion that the nonpolar and the polar groups of the protein contribute roughly equally to the stability of the folded state of the molecule and that the solvent-accessible surface area of the denatured form of a protein is no more than about two-thirds that of the fully extended form.\r"

The selection was developed by using the transcription factor GAL4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a selectable marker, a cloned protease from tobacco etch virus (TEV), and an 18-amino acid TEV protease target sequence. In yeast, TEV protease cleaves its target even when the target is fused to internal regions of the GAL4 protein. This cleavage separates the DNA binding domain from the transcription activation domain of GAL4, rendering it transcriptionally inactive. The proteolytic cleavage can be detected phenotypically by the inability of cells to metabolize galactose. Cells expressing the TEV protease can also be selected on the suicide substrate 2-deoxygalactose. DNA binding studies show that the TEV protease decreases the activity of the GAL4/target fusion protein. Because another protease target sequence of 55 amino acids can be inserted into GAL4 without any loss of transcriptional activity, this assay offers the opportunity to use high-efficiency cDNA cloning and expression vectors to select coding sequences of other proteases from various species. The assay could also be used to help define both target specificities and functional domains of proteases.\r"

Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells by the library DNA led to the detection of several transformed foci from which identical plasmids with transforming ability could be rescued. Structure and sequence analysis of the cDNA clones revealed that the oncogene was created by recombinational events involving an unknown gene and the mouse homologue of the B-raf protooncogene. Detection of the same genetic rearrangement in independent primary transformants implied that generation of the oncogene occurred within the tumor rather than during DNA transfection or cDNA library construction. The high frequency at which clones were identified and the large sizes of some of the transforming cDNA inserts isolated suggest wide applicability of this mammalian expression cloning system for isolating cDNAs of biologic interest.\r"

  ".W": "Transit from M phase into interphase in many eukaryotic cells is preceded by an increase in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i), which may act via calcium-dependent enzymes to trigger the M-phase/interphase transition. To test the role of the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) in the M-phase/interphase transition, PKC was activated in M-phase-arrested Xenopus eggs by treatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate under conditions that prevent a rise in [Ca2+]i and activation of other calcium-dependent enzymes. Under these conditions, several cellular events characteristic of transit into interphase occur: sperm chromatin decondenses, the Golgi and the nuclear envelope reassemble, and endocytosis resumes. These events are also triggered by treatment of eggs with the diacylglycerol 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol. Surprisingly, the activity of M-phase-promoting factor (MPF), a universal regulator of M phase, remains high under these conditions. If [Ca2+]i is subsequently raised, MPF activity is rapidly destroyed. Similarly, lysates made from eggs treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate support sperm chromatin decondensation in vitro and yet retain high MPF activity, measured either as the ability to induce meiotic resumption in oocytes or as histone H1 kinase activity. These effects are not triggered by the 4 alpha-phorbol ester isomer, which does not activate PKC, and are sensitive to the PKC \"pseudosubstrate\" peptide. The results suggest that two, parallel signals are generated by the rise in [Ca2+]i both of which contribute to cell cycle regulation. One pathway inactivates MPF; the other pathway activates PKC.\r"

  ".W": "Influenza A and B viruses have not been shown to form reassortants. It had been assumed that the lack of genotypic mixing between influenza virus types reflected differences in polymerase and packaging specificity. In this study, we show that an influenza A virus polymerase transcribes and replicates a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene flanked by the nontranslated sequences of an influenza B virus gene. Although the transcription level of this CAT gene was several times lower than that of a CAT gene flanked by the homologous nontranslated sequences of an influenza A virus, we proceeded to construct a chimeric type A/B influenza virus. Using recombinant DNA techniques, a chimeric neuraminidase gene was introduced into the genome of influenza A/WSN/33 virus. The hybrid influenza A/B virus gene contained the coding region of the A/WSN neuraminidase and the 3' and 5' nontranslated sequences of the nonstructural gene of influenza B/Lee virus. The resulting chimeric virus formed plaques in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells but replicated more slowly and achieved lower titers than wild-type influenza A/WSN/33 virus. The chimeric virus was attenuated for mice as indicated by a 400-fold increase in its LD50. Interestingly, the virus was greatly restricted in replication in the upper respiratory tract and partially restricted in the lungs. Animals infected with the transfectant virus were highly resistant to influenza virus challenge. It appears that this chimeric virus has many of the properties desirable for a live attenuated virus vaccine.\r"

In this study, we have investigated the effect of CKII phosphorylation site mutations, all of which lead to unphosphorylated E7 proteins. The replacement of the two serines by uncharged alanine residues drastically reduced the ability of E7 to cotransform primary cells with ras, whereas negatively charged aspartic acid at the same positions produced only a slight effect. This difference was not reflected in the p105Rb binding or the E2 promoter transactivation capability of these two mutants. Mutations that changed the CKII consensus without altering the serine residues also resulted in a loss of phosphorylation and transformation. This indicated that negative charge at positions 31/32 provided either by phosphorylation or by a negatively charged amino acid is necessary for efficient transformation without significantly affecting p105Rb binding or transactivation.\r"

A single SDS/PAGE-purified 115-kDa protein band was used to produce a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. This antibody preparation precipitated alkaline phosphodiesterase I activity, indicating that the SDS/PAGE-purified protein was nucleotide pyrophosphatase/alkaline phosphodiesterase I. When used for Western blot analysis, the antiserum detected a 115-kDa protein as well as a 220-kDa protein band. Multiple overlapping cDNA clones were isolated from a cDNA expression library screened with this anti-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/alkaline phosphodiesterase I antiserum. Sequence analysis indicated that the isolated cDNA clones encoded PC-1, a murine plasma cell differentiation antigen. To confirm the suspected enzymatic identity of PC-1, a recombinant PC-1 fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, purified, and used to produce another rabbit polyclonal antiserum. This antiserum likewise immunoprecipitated alkaline phosphodiesterase I activity and recognized the 115-kDa and 220-kDa proteins in Western blot analyses of cell extracts. Furthermore, expression of nucleotide pyrophosphatase/alkaline phosphodiesterase I corresponded directly with mRNA and protein levels of PC-1 in cells known to express different levels of nucleotide pyrophosphatase/alkaline phosphodiesterase I activity. Finally, steroid induction of enzymatic activity was mirrored by levels of PC-1 mRNA and protein expression. Together, these data indicate that the plasma cell differentiation antigen PC-1 is a membrane-bound enzyme, nucleotide pyrophosphatase/alkaline phosphodiesterase I.\r"

DNA probes for at least seven different genes mapping to this region were isolated. These hybridize to a minimum of eight different transcripts ranging from approximately 1.3 to 3.7 kilobases (kb). The deduced amino acid sequences of the corresponding cDNAs indicate that three of these genes are new members of the MHC class II gene family. These genes are transcribed in a tissue-specific pattern similar to that of the traditional class II genes. Two of the remaining four genes, HAM1 and HAM2, are homologous to one another and to a family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic transport proteins and may be involved in antigen processing. The tissue distribution of HAM1 transcripts is consistent with its proposed role in class I-restricted antigen processing, whereas HAM2 transcription appears more restricted and may be involved in antigen processing for class II-restricted T cells. The HAM2 gene may produce two differentially spliced transcripts. The identity of the remaining two genes is not known. Analyses of transcript sizes, tissue distribution, sequence, and genetic mapping data suggest that none of these genes code for LMP antigens.\r"

  ".U": "91271358\r", 
  ".W": "The CD3 eta subunit of the T-cell receptor is thought to subserve an important role in signal transduction and possibly T-cell development. Herein we characterize the organization of the mouse CD3 eta gene and show that it is part of one gene locus that also encodes CD3 zeta on chromosome 1. The NH2-terminal sequence of CD3 zeta and CD3 eta, which share the same leader peptide and are identical through amino acid 122 of each mature protein, is encoded by exons 1-7. However, exons 8 and 9 are differentially spliced to give rise to CD3 zeta and CD3 eta: exons 1-8 encode CD3 zeta and exons 1-7 plus 9 encode CD3 eta. RNase protection analysis with RNA from a variety of fetal, neonatal, and adult cell types indicates that expression of both gene products is T-lineage-restricted. Importantly, expression of CD3 zeta and CD3 eta mRNA appears before or on day 16 of fetal gestation. Expression is apparently coordinate since no cell types tested express CD3 zeta or CD3 eta alone. The steady-state level of CD3 zeta mRNA is greater than or equal to 40-60 times that of CD3 eta mRNA. In immature CD4+CD8+CD3low double-positive thymocytes and CD4+CD8-CD3high or CD4-CD8+CD3high single-positive thymocytes, the respective steady-state CD3 zeta and CD3 eta mRNA levels are equivalent, whereas the amount of receptor-associated CD3 zeta and CD3 eta proteins in double-positive thymocytes is approximately 10 times less than in single-positive thymocytes. Nevertheless, the CD3 zeta/CD3 eta protein ratio remains constant in all populations (40-60:1). Furthermore, discordance between mRNA and protein levels for CD3 zeta and CD3 eta is also observed in splenic T cells. Thus, posttranscriptional and/or transcriptional regulatory mechanisms control CD3 zeta and CD3 eta expression during T-cell development.\r"

  ".W": "Vectors were constructed for the isolation of random transcriptional and translational beta-glucuronidase gene fusions in plants. This system is based on the random integration of the transferred DNA (T-DNA) into the plant nuclear genome. The Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase coding sequence without promoter, and also devoid of its ATG initiation site in the translational gene fusion vector, was inserted in the T-DNA with its 5' end at a distance of 4 base pairs from the right T-DNA border sequence. Transgenic plants can be selected by using a chimeric (P35S-nptII-3' ocs) kanamycin-resistance gene present in the same T-DNA. Subsequent screening of these for beta-glucuronidase expression allows the identification of clones harboring a fusion of the beta-glucuronidase coding sequence with plant 5' regulatory sequences. After transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana C24 root explants, beta-glucuronidase expression was detected in 54% and 1.6% of the plants transformed with the transcriptional and translational fusion vectors, respectively. Several different patterns of tissue-specific beta-glucuronidase expression were identified. The plant upstream sequence of a beta-glucuronidase fusion that is specifically expressed in the phloem of all organs was cloned and sequenced. After introduction in A. thaliana C24 and Nicotiana tabacum SR1, this sequence mediates the same highly phloem-specific beta-glucuronidase expression pattern as in the original transgenic plant from which it was isolated. These data demonstrate that this system facilitates the isolation and analysis of plant DNA sequences mediating regulated gene expression.\r"

However, recent studies have shown that protein 4.1 is ubiquitous in mammalian cells. Here, we show that protein 4.1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. The phosphorylation site has been localized to the 8-kDa domain, which has one tyrosine, tyrosine-418. The 8-kDa region is required for the assembly of the spectrin/actin complex, and phosphorylation by EGFR reduced the ability of protein 4.1 to promote the assembly of the spectrin/actin/protein 4.1 ternary complex. Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed that purified protein 4.1 contained phosphorylated tyrosine, and this increased upon phosphorylation by EGFR. This suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of protein 4.1 occurs in vivo and may be functionally significant. The tyrosine phosphorylation site is in the center of a sequence motif that is expressed by a differentiation-specific splicing mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Differences in the pattern of growth hormone (GH) secretion in mature rats (i.e., \"continuous\" secretion in females versus \"pulsatile\" secretion in males) are thought to be the underlying cause of sex-dependent differences in a subpopulation of liver microsomal P450 enzymes and steroid 5 alpha-reductase. A new strain of dwarf rats (NIMR/AS) has recently been shown to have low or undetectable levels of circulating GH due to a selective defect in pituitary GH synthesis. We have measured the levels and/or activity of IIA1 (P450a), IIA2 (P450m), IIC11 (P450h), IIC12 (P450i), IIIA2 (a P450p isozyme), and steroid 5 alpha-reductase in liver microsomes from male and female dwarf rats, to test the hypothesis that the expression of these sexually dimorphic enzymes is regulated by GH. In mature rats, the levels of liver microsomal IIA2, IIC11, and IIIA2 were higher in male than in female dwarf rats, whereas the levels of activity of IIA1, IIC12, and steroid 5 alpha-reductase were greater in female than in male dwarf rats. These sex differences resulted from age-related changes in either male dwarf rats (i.e., an increase in IIC11 and IIA2 and a decrease in IIA1) or female dwarf rats (i.e., an increase in IIC12 and 5 alpha-reductase and a decrease in IIIA2). The magnitudes of these sex-dependent, age-related changes were essentially indistinguishable from those observed in normal rats. These unexpected results suggest that GH is not the pituitary factor responsible for regulating the levels of sexually dimorphic, steroid-metabolizing enzymes in rat liver. Alternatively, it is possible that these enzymes are regulated by extremely low levels of GH. In either case, the current model of how steroid-metabolizing enzymes are regulated in rats must be revised to account for the normal sexual differentiation of these enzymes in dwarf rats.\r"

Human IL-1ra has some sequence identity to human IL-1 beta, but the evolutionary relationship between these proteins has been unclear. We show that the genes for human, mouse, and rat IL-1ra are similar to the genes for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in intron-exon organization, indicating that gene duplication events were important in the creation of this gene family. Furthermore, an analysis of sequence comparisons and mutation rates for IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-1ra suggests that the duplication giving rise to the IL-1ra gene was an early event in the evolution of the gene family. Comparisons between the mature sequences for IL-1ra, IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta suggest that IL-1ra has a beta-stranded structure like to IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, consistent with the three proteins being related. The N-terminal sequences of IL-1ra appear to be derived from a region of the genome different than those of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, thus explaining their different modes of biosynthesis and suggesting an explanation for their different biological activities.\r"

  ".W": "The acetylation polymorphism is one of the most common genetic variations in the transformation of drugs and chemicals. More than 50% of individuals in Caucasian populations are homozygous for a recessive trait and are of the \"slow acetylator\" phenotype. They are less efficient than \"rapid acetylators\" in the metabolism of numerous drugs and environmental and industrial chemicals. The acetylation polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of drug toxicity and with an increased frequency of certain cancers. We report the identification of the primary mutations in two alleles of the gene for the N-acetyltransferase (NAT; acetyl-CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.5) isozyme NAT2 associated with slow acetylation. These alleles, M1 and M2, account for more than 90% of slow acetylator alleles in the European population we have studied. M1 and M2 were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphisms with Kpn I and Msp I and subsequently cloned and sequenced. M1 and M2 each are characterized by a combination of two different point mutations, one causing an amino acid substitution (Ile-113----Thr in M1, Arg-197----Gln in M2), the other being silent (C 481----T in M1, C 282----T in M2). Functional expression of M1 and M2 and of chimeric gene constructs between mutant and wild-type NAT2 in COS-1 cells suggests that M1 causes a decrease of NAT2 protein in the liver by defective translation, whereas M2 produces an unstable enzyme. On the basis of the mutations described here and a rare mutant allele (M3) reported recently, we have developed a simple DNA amplification assay that allows the predictive genotyping of more than 95% of slow and rapid acetylator alleles and the identification of individuals at risk.\r"

Both SNAP-25 protein and mRNA were present at low levels in embryonic day 15 rat brain, and levels of both increased during early postnatal maturation. Developmental immunoblots with antipeptide antisera demonstrated that a 25-kDa peptide was the major isoform in brain, and this form increased steadily from embryonic day 15 through adulthood. A second 27-kDa immunoreactive isoform was present in brain only during early development. Immunoblots of two-dimensional SDS/polyacrylamide gels revealed the presence of a predominant 25-kDa isoform of SNAP-25 in adult brain. Immunocytochemical studies indicated that as immunoreactivity for SNAP-25 increased during development, the cellular localization of SNAP-25 immunoreactivity concomitantly shifted from axons and cell bodies to presynaptic terminals. These data suggest that the SNAP-25 protein shifts in subcellular localization during development and may play a role in the establishment and stabilization of specific presynaptic terminals in brain.\r"

  ".W": "The recruitment of monocyte-macrophages into the artery wall is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is a potent monocyte chemoattractant secreted by many cells in vitro, including vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. To test whether it is expressed in the artery in vivo, we used Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemistry to study the expression of MCP-1 in normal and atherosclerotic human and rabbit arteries. Northern blot analysis showed that MCP-1 mRNA could be isolated from rabbit atherosclerotic lesions but not from the intima media of normal animals. Furthermore, MCP-1 mRNA was extracted from macrophage-derived foam cells isolated from arterial lesions of ballooned cholesterol-fed rabbits, whereas alveolar macrophages isolated simultaneously from the same rabbits did not express MCP-1 mRNA. MCP-1 mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization in macrophage-rich regions of both human and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions. No MCP-1 mRNA was found in sublesional medial smooth muscle cells or in normal arteries. By using immunocytochemistry, MCP-1 protein was demonstrated in human lesions, again only in macrophage-rich regions. Immunostaining of the serial sections with an antiserum against malondialdehyde-modified low density lipoprotein indicated the presence of oxidized low density lipoprotein indicated the presence of oxidized low density lipoprotein and/or other oxidation-specific lipid-protein adducts in the same areas that contained macrophages and MCP-1. We conclude that (i) MCP-1 is strongly expressed in a small subset of cells in macrophage-rich regions of human and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions and (ii) MCP-1 may, therefore, play an important role in the ongoing recruitment of monocyte-macrophages into developing lesions in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The product of the human retinoblastoma gene (RB) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that is thought to function as a tumor suppressor. Mutations of RB frequently occur in human bladder carcinoma. To investigate the significance of the functional loss of this gene in bladder cancer, an RB expression plasmid (pBARB) under control of the human beta-actin promoter was transfected into the bladder carcinoma cell line HTB9, which lacks RB expression. Marker-selected transfectants that expressed RB protein were identified by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical staining. In selected clones, stable RB expression has persisted over 1 yr under standard culture conditions with 10% serum. However, RB expression caused major alterations of HTB9 growth properties both in vitro and in vivo. RB+ transfectants lacked the ability to form colonies in semi-solid medium, and their growth rate was significantly decreased in 3% serum. In addition, the tumorigenicity of these transfectants was markedly decreased. Tumors that formed in nude mice were much smaller and had a longer latency period but were indistinguishable microscopically from those produced by parental cells. Slower growing tumors were RB+, as measured by nuclear staining of their RB protein and by a normal RB protein pattern on immunoblots. These findings support the concept that the RB gene acts as both a growth and tumor suppressor in bladder cancer cells.\r"

  ".U": "91271369\r", 
  ".W": "The reverse transcriptase of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is a heterodimeric protein consisting of two polypeptides with masses of 66 and 51 kDa and has, as a second enzymatic activity, RNase H activity. The 66-kDa polypeptide can be cleaved by the virus-encoded protease to yield polypeptides of 51 and 15 kDa. The latter has been characterized as possessing RNase H activity [Hansen, J., Schultze, T., Mellert, W. & Moelling, K. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 239-243]. We have purified simultaneously the heterodimeric reverse transcriptase/RNase H containing the 66/51-kDa polypeptides and the 15-kDa RNase H from Escherichia coli containing the expression vector pJS 3.7 by a procedure including chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and heparin-Sepharose. Two RNase H and reverse transcriptase peaks were separated on phosphocellulose, one coinciding with the heterodimeric protein and the other with the 15-kDa protein. On the basis of the following findings it appears that the 15-kDa polypeptide has both RNase H and reverse transcriptase activities: (i) it copurified with both activities; (ii) it functioned as a reverse transcriptase in an in situ assay after SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; (iii) polyclonal antibodies raised against the 66-kDa polypeptide reacted in immunoblots exclusively with a 15-kDa polypeptide, reacted in immunoblots exclusively with a 15-kDa polypeptide, while no immunoreactive bands in the range of 51-66 kDa were seen in the 15-kDa polypeptide preparation; (iv) the p15 and the p66/51 reverse transcriptase could be quantitatively pelleted in an enzymatically active form only when antibodies specific for the p66 carboxyl terminus were used; and (v) the p15 protein had bona fide properties of a reverse transcriptase and could enzymatically synthesize a high molecular weight, alkali-resistant product. The two reverse transcriptases appear to have different behaviors on various template/primer systems tested. Conceivably different forms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptases might be used in individual steps of (+)- and (-)-strand replication.\r"

Victoria-pithecus shares a suite of craniofacial features with the Oligocene catarrhine Aegyptopithecus and early Miocene hominoid Afropithecus. All three genera manifest supraorbital costae, anteriorly convergent temporal lines, the absence of a postglabellar fossa, a moderate to long snout, great facial height below the orbits, a deep cheek region, and anteriorly tapering premaxilla. The shared presence of these features in a catarrhine generally ancestral to apes and Old World monkeys, an early ape, and an early Old World monkey indicates that they are primitive characteristics that typified the last common ancestor of Hominoidea and Cercopithecoidea. These results contradict prevailing cranial morphotype reconstructions for ancestral catarrhines as Colobus- or Hylobates-like, characterized by a globular anterior braincase and orthognathy. By resolving several equivocal craniofacial morphocline polarities, these discoveries lay the foundation for a revised interpretation of the ancestral cranial morphology of Catarrhini more consistent with neontological and existing paleontological evidence.\r"

A distinctive, outwardly rectifying, depolarization-induced Cl- channel (ORDIC channel) has been proposed to account for the Cl- conductance that is defective in CF. The recently identified CF gene is predicted to code for a 1480-amino acid integral membrane protein termed the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The CFTR shares sequence similarity with a superfamily of ATP-binding membrane transport proteins such as P-glycoprotein and STE6, but it also has features consistent with an ion channel function. It has been proposed that the CFTR might be an ORDIC channel. To determine if CFTR and ORDIC channel expression are correlated, we surveyed various cell lines for natural variation in CFTR and ORDIC channel expression. In four human epithelial cell lines (T84, CaCo2, PANC-1, and 9HTEo-/S) that encompass the full observed range of CFTR mRNA levels and ORDIC channel density we found no correlation.\r"

A spontaneously transformed rat mucosal epithelial cell was selected for hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency and transfected with a plasmid conferring hygromycin resistance (BRIE 291 cells). Fusion of these cells with dispersed small intestinal epithelia cells resulted in hybrid cell lines that retained characteristic properties of the native GI cell more effectively than the transformed tumorigenic parental cell line. Hybrid hBRIE 380 cells are uniformly cuboidal with microvilli, contain villin, are contact inhibited, are anchorage dependent, require serum supplementation for growth, and are more sensitive to virus infection than the parental BRIE 291 cells. Fusion of BRIE 291 with dispersed pancreatic islet cells has resulted in a variety of pancreatic-hormone-producing cell lines. One of these, hybrid hBRIE 291-i2, forms confluent monolayers capable of synthesizing insulin-like immunoreactivity. These studies demonstrate that functionally polarized GI cells can be generated from primary cultures of nondividing committed epithelial cells by somatic cell hybridization and make feasible the selection and maintenance of specific GI epithelial cell types in confluent monolayer cultures.\r"

The application of this concept to the measurement of transcript stability is presented in detail. The data indicate that growth hormone stimulates the transcription rates of insulin-like growth factor I, actin, and albumin genes. The stability of all three transcripts, particularly albumin, appears to be lower in growth hormone-containing medium than it is in insulin-containing medium. The experiments indicate that the rates of transcription and/or degradation of albumin mRNA are influenced by hormonal treatment. However, the cells maintain roughly constant albumin transcript levels independent of hormone treatment by compensatory changes in the rates of transcription and degradation.\r"

  ".U": "91271376\r", 
  ".W": "Two mammalian gene products, PC2 and PC3, have been proposed as candidate neuroendocrine-precursor processing enzymes based on the structural similarity of their catalytic domains to that of the yeast precursor-processing endoprotease Kex2. In this report we demonstrate that these two proteases can cleave proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells. Similarly to pituitary corticotrophs, PC3 expressed in processing-deficient BSC-40 cells cleaved native mouse POMC at the -Lys-Arg- sites flanking corticotropin. The -Lys-Arg- within beta-lipotropin was less efficiently cleaved to release beta-endorphin. Expression of PC2 together with PC3 resulted in efficient conversion of beta-lipotropin, as occurs in pituitary melanotrophs. Furthermore, coexpression of PC2 together with mouse POMC in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells resulted in conversion of beta-lipotropin to gamma-lipotropin and beta-endorphin in the regulated secretory pathway. Finally, the processing selectivities of PC3 and PC2 expressed together in BSC-40 cells were determined by using a series of mutant mouse POMCs containing all possible pairs of basic residues at certain sites. The observed pattern of cleavage site selectivities mimicked that of the endogenous endoproteases of the insulinoma and bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells, suggesting that PC2 and PC3 may represent important core endoproteases in the catalysis of prohormone processing in many neuroendocrine cell types.\r"

The enzyme was shown to be distinct from a previously characterized protein farnesyltransferase (PFT). The PGT selectively geranylgeranylated a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the gamma 6 subunit of bovine brain G proteins, which have previously been shown to contain a 20-carbon prenyl modification. Likewise, a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of human lamin B, a known farnesylated protein, selectively served as a substrate for farnesylation by the PFT. However, with high concentrations of peptide acceptors, both prenyl transferases were able to use either peptide as substrates and the PGT was able to catalyze farnesyl transfer. Among the prenyl acceptors tested, peptides and proteins with leucine or phenylalanine at their C termini served as geranylgeranyl acceptors, whereas those with C-terminal serine were preferentially farnesylated. These results suggest that the C-terminal amino acid is an important structural determinant in controlling the specificity of protein prenylation.\r"

The Gln11 side chain is folded in an unusual fashion in order to close the channel.

Experimental and theoretical studies on natural and synthetic peptides and proteins indicate that individual side chains differ in their helix-forming potential. Four aliphatic side chains occur in the standard complement of amino acids: alanine and leucine are helix stabilizing, whereas isoleucine and valine are weakly destabilizing. We have synthesized a series of helical peptides containing unnatural aliphatic side chains having two to four carbons to explore some of the factors involved in alpha-helix stabilization and the basis for selection of the natural set. We find that linear side chains with two, three, or four carbons are as strongly helix stabilizing as the single methyl in alanine and that all linear side chains are stronger helix promoters than leucine. In addition, a t-butyl side chain is significantly more helix destabilizing than the sec-butyl side chain of isoleucine, the isopropyl side chain of valine, or even the unrestricted side chain of glycine. These results provide experimental evidence that restriction in conformational freedom of a side chain imposed by alpha-helix formation is a major component of the role of a side chain in stabilizing helical structure.\r"

When Jurkat cells or their Nef-2-expressing transformants are treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus either phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or antibodies against CD3 epsilon, T-cell receptor beta chain, or CD2, there is a prompt increase in interleukin 2 (IL-2) mRNA and intracellular calcium and in the IL-2 receptor alpha chain on the cell surface. Although cells expressing Nef-1 also induce calcium mobilization and the production of IL-2 receptor alpha chain, the formation of IL-2 mRNA is blocked in response to these stimuli. Moreover, Nef-1-expressing cells transfected with a plasmid in which the IL-2 promoter is fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene fail to induce CAT following treatment with PMA and PHA. By contrast, the parental and Nef-2-containing cells induce CAT normally. Nef-1-expressing cells can produce IL-2 mRNA in response to a combination of PMA and ionomycin, although much less efficiently than the parental Jurkat cells or Nef-2-expressing cells. These findings, and others described herein, suggest that the virally encoded Nef protein interferes with a signal emanating from the T-cell receptor complex that induces IL-2 gene transcription.\r"

We show that in the presence of Cro protein, circular DNA molecules are formed with substantial frequency. No circular molecules are observed in the DNA samples ligated in the absence of Cro.

Comparison of the rat secretin gene to the other members of the glucagon-secretin gene family reveals that similarities are restricted to the exons encoding the biologically active peptides. Analysis of RNA from porcine intestine indicates that at least two transcripts are generated from the porcine secretin gene as a result of differential splicing. The longer and more abundant transcript appears to be identical to a previously isolated cDNA, which encodes a precursor that includes a 72-amino acid C-terminal extension peptide. The shorter transcript does not contain the third exon and, as a result, encodes only 44 residues beyond the C terminus of secretin. The amino acid sequence deduced from the shorter transcript is identical to a precursor form of secretin recently isolated from porcine duodenum [Gafvelin, G., Jornvall, H. & Mutt, V. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 6781-6785]. Developmental studies reveal that both secretin mRNA and peptide levels in the intestine are highest just before birth, prior to the onset of gastric acid secretion and feeding. This observation implies that secretin biosynthesis in developing animals is controlled independently of the principal factors known to regulate secretin release in adult animals.\r"

  ".W": "1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACC synthase; S-adenosyl-L-methionine methylthioadenosine-lyase, EC 4.4.1.14) is the regulated enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the plant hormone ethylene. A full-length cDNA encoding this enzyme has been cloned from tomato fruits [Van Der Straeten, D., Van Wiemeersch, L., Goodman, H. M. & Van Montagu, M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1990) 87, 4859-4863]. We report here the complete nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of a cDNA encoding a second isoform of ACC synthase from tomato fruits. The cDNAs coding for both isoforms contain highly conserved regions that are surrounded by regions of low homology, especially at the 5' and 3' ends. Gene-specific probes were constructed to examine the expression of transcripts encoding the two ACC synthase isoforms under two conditions of enhanced ethylene formation--namely, during fruit ripening and in response to mechanical stress (wounding). The level of mRNA encoding both isoforms, ACC synthase 1 and 2, increased during ripening. In contrast, wounding caused an increase in only the level of mRNA coding for ACC synthase 1. Blot analysis of genomic DNA digested with restriction enzymes confirmed that ACC synthase 1 and 2 are encoded by different genes.\r"

  ".W": "A comparison of the monoclinic and orthorhombic crystal structures of the uncomplexed double-stranded, antiparallel, left-handed beta-helix (5.6 amino acid residues per turn) (increases decreases beta 5.6) conformers of gramicidin A reveals marked differences in the tryptophan side-chain orientations and the degree of helical uniformity of the dimer and in the manner in which these helical dimers associate with one another in the crystal. The helix of the orthorhombic dimer exhibits a regular pattern of bulges and constrictions that appears to be induced by crystal packing forces affecting tryptophan side chains that are aligned parallel to the helix axis. The monoclinic dimer is more uniform than the orthorhombic dimer as a consequence of pi stacking interactions between dimers in which orientation of tryptophan side chains is normal to the helix axis to relieve the lateral crystal packing forces that may locally twist and deform the helix. It may be inferred from these observations that lipid interactions may be expected to destabilize the increases decreases beta 5.6 helix when it is inserted into a membrane bilayer.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of covalent modifications to DNA (carcinogen-DNA adducts) in 42 human urinary bladder biopsy samples was investigated by 32P-postlabeling methods, with enhancement by both nuclease P1 treatment and 1-butanol extraction. Total mean carcinogen-DNA adduct levels and the mean levels of several specific adducts were significantly elevated in DNA samples of 13 current smokers, as opposed to 9 never smokers or 20 ex-smokers (5 years abstinence). There was no significant difference between the latter two groups. Several DNA adducts enhanced by nuclease P1 treatment were chromatographically similar to putative hydrocarbon DNA adducts reported earlier for placenta and lung DNA samples obtained from cigarette smokers. Putative aromatic amine adducts were detected by 1-butanol extraction that were not present when the samples were treated with nuclease P1. One of these displayed chromatographic behavior identical to the predominant adduct induced by the human urinary bladder carcinogen, 4-aminobiphenyl, which is present in cigarette smoke. This adduct comigrated in several thin-layer chromatographic systems with a synthetic N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-amino[2,2'-3H]biphenyl-3',5'-bisphosphate marker. Moreover, when this adduct was eluted from the thin-layer chromatograms of several individuals and injected onto an HPLC system, the 32P from the human bladder DNA samples coeluted in the same fraction as the tritiated synthetic N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl marker. These data reinforce an association between cigarette smoking and DNA damage and suggest a molecular basis for the initiation of human urinary bladder cancer by cigarette smoke.\r"

  ".W": "Aging is the accumulation of changes responsible for the sequential alterations that accompany advancing age and the associated progressive increases in the chance of disease and death. Average life expectancies at birth in the developed countries are now approaching plateau values as the aging changes associated with the environment and disease near irreducible levels. The inborn aging process is now the major risk factor for disease and death after around age 28 in the developed countries and limits average life expectancy at birth to approximately 85 years. Future significant increases in average life expectancy--a rough measure of the healthy, productive life-span, i.e., the functional life-span--in these countries will be achieved only by slowing the rate of production of aging changes by the aging process. Many theories have been advanced to account for the aging process. The free radical theory of aging is discussed briefly. The importance attached to increasing the functional life-span dictates that aging hypotheses be explored for practical means of achieving this goal while work continues toward a consensus on the cause(s) of the aging process. Efforts to further increase the functional life-span by conventional measures are now almost futile, whereas those directed toward slowing the aging process are just beginning. These new efforts show promise.\r"

  ".W": "Catalytic activity of heme oxygenase (heme, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.99.3) isozymes, HO-1 and HO-2, permits production of physiologic isomers of bile pigments. In turn, bile pigments biliverdin and bilirubin are effective antioxidants in biological systems. In the rat brain we have identified only the HO-1 isozyme of heme oxygenase as a heat shock protein and defined hyperthermia as a stimulus that causes an increase in brain HO-1 protein. Exposure of male rats to 42 degrees C for 20 min caused a rapid and marked increase in brain 1.8-kilobase HO-1 mRNA. Specifically, a 33-fold increase in brain HO-1 mRNA was observed within 1 h and sustained for at least 6 h posttreatment. In contrast, the two HO-2 homologous transcripts (1.3 and 1.9 kilobases) did not respond to heat shock; neither the ratio nor the level of the two messages differed from that of the control when measured either at 1, 6, or 24 h after hyperthermia. The induction of a 1.8-kilobase HO-1 mRNA resulted in a pronounced increase in HO-1 protein 6 h after hyperthermia, as detected by both Western immunoblot and RIA. Immunocytochemistry of rat brain showed discrete localization of HO-1-like protein only in neurons of select brain regions. Six hours after heat shock, an intense increase in HO-1-like protein was observed in both Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and epithelial cells lining the cerebral aqueduct of the brain. We suggest that the increase in HO-1 protein, hence increased capacity to form bile pigments, represents a neuronal defense mechanism against heat shock stress.\r"

From cDNA for the influenza virus RNA genome segment 8, the region coding for the nonstructural protein was deleted and replaced by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The resulting DNA sequence was placed under the control of the promoter of T7 RNA polymerase such that the antisense RNA to CAT mRNA was produced when transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. Transfection of HeLa cells with this antisense CAT RNA in the presence of the helper ribonucleoprotein cores led to no significant production of the CAT. In contrast, when the RNA was covered with purified nucleoprotein prior to transfection, the CAT gene was efficiently expressed. This indicated that the viral RNA polymerase transcribed the RNA transfected as the RNA-nucleoprotein complexes. In addition, this system was used for analysis of the cis-acting region in transcription and the promoter structure of the viral RNA genome.\r"

  ".W": "The theory presented here is based on results from in vitro experiments and deals with three proteins in the postsynaptic density/membrane-namely, calmodulin, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. It is visualized that, in vivo in the polarized state of the membrane, calmodulin is bound to the kinase; upon depolarization of the membrane and the intrusion of Ca2+, Ca2(+)-bound calmodulin activates the autophosphorylation of the kinase. Calmodulin is visualized as having less affinity for the phosphorylated form of the kinase and is translocated to the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. There, with its bound Ca2+, it acts as a Ca2+ sensor, to close off the Ca2+ channel of the depolarized membrane. At the same time, it is thought that the configuration of the kinase is altered by its phosphorylated states; by interacting with Na+ and K+ channels, it alters the electrical properties of the membrane to regain the polarized state. Calmodulin is moved to the unphosphorylated kinase to complete the cycle, allowing the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel to be receptive to Ca2+ flux upon the next cycle of depolarization. Thus, the theory tries to explain (i) why calmodulin and the kinase reside at the postsynaptic density/membrane site, and (ii) what function autophosphorylation of the kinase may play.\r"

When administered either before or after training, injections of TTX into the IC impaired performance on a 48-hr retention test. Injections of TTX into the PC also impaired retention when administered before training. One week later, rats with cannulae in the IC, FC, and PC received microinjections of TTX either before or after training in a water maze (Morris) spatial learning task and retention was tested 24 hr later. TTX impaired retention when administered to the IC either before or after training. These findings indicate that a functionally intact IC during and after training in these tasks appears to be essential for the storage of long-term memory.\r"

  ".W": "The form of inhibitor protein of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKI) that has been most thoroughly studied is a protein purified from rabbit skeletal muscle. Beale et al. previously isolated a species of PKI from rat testis that appeared from its amino acid composition to be quite distinct from the rabbit skeletal muscle protein [Beale, E. G., Dedman, J. R. & Means, A. R. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6322-6327]. The amino acid sequence of a form of rat testis PKI has now been determined both by sequencing overlapping peptide fragments for 95% of the protein and by the isolation of a cDNA clone containing the coding region for the 70-amino acid protein. The sequence of the 70-amino acid testis PKI displays a maximum of only 41% sequence identity with the previously sequenced 75-amino acid rabbit skeletal muscle PKI. However, the two forms have identical potency as inhibitors and the key amino acids of the pseudosubstrate site, shown to be critical for maximal inhibition with the rabbit skeletal muscle PKI, have been conserved in the testis protein. The rabbit skeletal muscle and rat testis PKIs most likely represent distinct isoforms. The nucleotide sequence of the rat testis PKI cDNA suggests that a second form of testis PKI, longer by 8 additional amino-terminal amino acids, might also be produced.\r"

However, in the 6.10.2 variant of M1.19, an increase in MMTV transcription is hardly detectable upon exposure to hormone. The mechanism of hormone-unresponsiveness in these cells has been unclear. In this study, we show that nuclear extract from 6.10.2 cells contains a specific DNA-binding activity that recognizes a sequence motif extending from positions -163 to -147 on the MMTV promoter. An oligonucleotide probe spanning this region binds a nuclear factor distinct from the glucocorticoid receptor. In vivo competition experiments, where increased amounts of a plasmid containing this element were transfected into 6.10.2 cells, showed a dose-dependent increase in hormonal inducibility of MMTV expression. Together, these results indicate that this sequence motif negatively modulates glucocorticoid-inducible activation of the MMTV promoter. Moreover, we have characterized a nuclear factor that preferentially binds to the coding strand of this element.\r"

We have used biosynthetic labeling and oligosaccharide analysis to characterize the anionic-charge-carrying moieties on this protein. Kidney slices from 2-day-old rats were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]Cys, [3H]Man, [3H]GlcN, and 35SO4, after which podocalyxin was immunoprecipitated and purified by SDS/PAGE. All these labels were incorporated into podocalyxin. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to digestion with specific glycosidases or digested with Pronase followed by chromatographic analysis of the released glycopeptides. Podocalyxin was susceptible to digestion with N-Glycanase and O-Glycanase, indicating the presence of both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. Approximately 30% of the [3H]GlcN-labeled glycopeptides bound to Con A, confirming the presence of high mannose, hybrid, or biantennary N-linked structures; alkaline borohydride treatment confirmed the presence of O-linked oligosaccharides. Analysis of the 35SO4-labeled glycopeptides indicated that both the N- and O-linked structures were sulfated. We conclude that in newborn rat kidney (i) podocalyxin contains both O- and N-linked oligosaccharides [high mannose or hybrid type, biantennary, and complex (sialylated) type], (ii) podocalyxin is sulfated, and (iii) sulfate is located on both O-linked oligosaccharides and on glycopeptides carrying tri- or tetrantennary N-linked structures. These results indicate that the net negative charge of podocalyxin is most likely derived from sulfate as well as from sialic acid residues.\r"

ToxR is a transmembrane protein that binds to and activates the promoter of the operon encoding cholera toxin. As yet, the ability of ToxR to activate directly other genes in this regulon has not been demonstrated. We have cloned a gene called toxT from V. cholerae 569B; the toxT gene product, like ToxR, can activate the ctx promoter in Escherichia coli. In addition, expression of other genes identified as members of the ToxR regulon (tcpA, tcpI, aldA, and tagA) can be activated in E. coli by the toxT gene product but not by ToxR. When expressed from a constitutive promoter, the toxT gene product partially suppresses the ToxR- phenotype of a toxR deletion mutant of V. cholerae. The level of toxT mRNA is greatly reduced in a toxR mutant of V. cholerae. In addition, growth conditions under which the ToxR regulon is not expressed also repress the synthesis of toxT mRNA. These results suggest that ToxR controls transcription of toxT, whose product in turn is directly responsible for activation of several virulence genes under ToxR control.\r"

Here we report evidence that Asp-2 is located within an 8-centimorgan segment distal to b and that Asp-3 is linked to Mtv-1 on chromosome 7. We also present evidence that these three loci account for most of the heritable variation in susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in crosses of DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice and that susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is influenced by genomic imprinting. Thus, genomic imprinting may complicate linkage and mapping studies and should be considered in analyses of complex modes of inheritance.\r"

Mutations were found associated with (i) Burkitt lymphoma (9/27 biopsies; 17/27 cell lines) and its leukemic counterpart L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5/9), both of which also carry activated c-myc oncogenes, and (ii) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (6/40) and, in particular, its stage of progression known as Richter's transformation (3/7). Mutations were not found at any significant frequency in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In many cases, only the mutated allele was detectable, implying loss of the normal allele. These results suggest that (i) significant differences in the frequency of p53 mutations are present among subtypes of neoplasms derived from the same tissue; (ii) p53 may play a role in tumor progression in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia; (iii) the presence of both p53 loss/inactivation and c-myc oncogene activation may be important in the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma and its leukemic form L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\r"

We have cloned this protein and found it to be expressed as a 2.5-kilobase mRNA. The steady-state levels of PLAP mRNA are induced in smooth muscle and endothelial cells following treatment with leukotriene D4. The increased message levels coincide with increased amounts of PLAP. Synthetic antisense DNA was used to block the synthesis of PLAP and this treatment effectively blocked the activation of phospholipase A2 and the increased generation of prostanoids in smooth muscle and endothelial cells treated with leukotriene D4.\r"

  ".W": "Mutations in the two genes for type I collagen (COL1A1 or COL1A2) cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a heritable disease characterized by moderate to extreme brittleness of bone early in life. Here we show that a 52-year-old postmenopausal woman with severe osteopenia and a compression fracture of a thoracic vertebra had a mutation in the gene for the alpha 2(I) chain of type I collagen (COL1A2) similar to mutations that cause OI. cDNA was prepared from the woman's skin fibroblast RNA and assayed for the presence of a mutation by treating DNA heteroduplexes with carbodiimide. The results indicated a sequence variation in the region encoding amino acid residues 660-667 of the alpha 2(I) chain. Further analysis demonstrated a single-base mutation that caused a serine-for-glycine substitution at position 661 of the alpha 2(I) triple-helical domain. The substitution produced posttranslational overmodification of the collagen triple helix, as is seen with most glycine substitutions that cause OI. The patient had a history of five previous fractures, slightly blue sclerae, and slight hearing loss. Therefore, the results suggest that there may be phenotypic and genotypic overlap between mild osteogenesis imperfecta and postmenopausal osteoporosis, and that a subset of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis may have mutations in the genes for type I procollagen.\r"

  ".W": "Human fetal adrenal growth after midgestation is very rapid and appears to be dependent upon pituitary adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) in vivo. We hypothesized that the regulation of fetal adrenal growth by ACTH is mediated by ACTH-stimulated local growth factor production. As we have found basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to be a potent mitogen for human fetal adrenal cells in culture, we conducted studies to determine whether bFGF is synthesized by the human fetal adrenal gland and whether bFGF gene expression in primary cultures of human fetal adrenal cells is regulated by ACTH. Bioassayable bFGF-like activity was detected in extracts of whole human fetal adrenal glands and primary cultures of human fetal adrenal cells. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from whole human fetal adrenal glands revealed a characteristic 7-kilobase bFGF mRNA, indicating that the fetal adrenal bFGF bioactivity was most likely due to local synthesis. Slot blot and ribonuclease protection analysis showed that bFGF mRNA was present in very low amounts in total RNA from primary cultures of unstimulated human fetal adrenal cells but was increased 2- to 3-fold in cells exposed to 10 nM ACTH-(1-24) or 1 mM 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate for 24 hr. bFGF mRNA was localized to adrenocortical cells and not fibroblasts by in situ hybridization. bFGF mRNA was barely detectable in unstimulated cells, whereas it was markedly increased in cells exposed to either ACTH or 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. These data support our hypothesis that the regulation of human fetal adrenal growth by ACTH at midgestation may be mediated by the stimulation of local growth factor production, and we suggest that bFGF may play a major role in this process.\r"

Although insertional mutagenesis has been an invaluable genetic tool for analyzing the mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis, it has not yet been possible to apply it to the mycobacteria. To overcome intrinsic difficulties in directly manipulating the genetics of slow-growing mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine strains, we developed a system for random shuttle mutagenesis. A genomic library of Mycobacterium smegmatis was subjected to transposon mutagenesis with Tn5 seq1, a derivative of Tn5, in Escherichia coli and these transposon-containing recombinant plasmids were reintroduced into mycobacterial chromosomes by homologous recombination. This system has allowed us to isolate several random auxotrophic mutants of M. smegmatis. To extend this strategy to M. tuberculosis and BCG, targeted mutagenesis was performed using a cloned BCG methionine gene that was subjected to Tn5 seq1 mutagenesis in E. coli and reintroduced into the mycobacteria. Surprisingly for prokaryotes, both BCG and M. tuberculosis were found to incorporate linear DNA fragments into illegitimate sites throughout the mycobacterial genomes at a frequency of 10(-5) to 10(-4) relative to the number of transformants obtained with autonomously replicating vectors. Thus the efficient illegitimate recombination of linear DNA fragments provides the basis for an insertional mutagenesis system for M. tuberculosis and BCG.\r"

These channels are situated on the adherent follicular cells and are not present in denuded oocytes. Cromakalim-activated K+ channels are also activated by increases in intracellular cAMP, and cAMP-activated K+ channels are blocked by glibenclamide. Although cromakalim and cAMP effects are synergistic, cromakalim activation of K+ channels is drastically reduced or abolished by treatments that stimulate protein kinase C (e.g., muscarinic effectors, phorbol esters). Gonadotropins, known to play an essential role in ovarian physiology, also activate cromakalim and sulfonylurea-sensitive K+ channels. Follicular oocytes constitute an excellent system for studying regulation of cromakalim-sensitive K+ channels that are important in relation to a variety of disease processes, such as cardiovascular dysfunction and asthma, as well as brain function.\r"

Amino acid sequences of more than 100 members of different subfamilies are known, but crystal structures of only mammalian ras p21 and bacterial elongation factor Tu have been determined. After optimal superposition of these remarkably similar structures, careful multiple sequence alignment, and calculation of residue-residue interactions, we analyzed the two subfamilies in terms of structural conservation, sequence conservation, and residue contact strength. There are three main results. (i) A structure-based alignment of p21 and elongation factor Tu. (ii) The definition of a common conserved structural core that may be useful as the basis of model building by homology of the three-dimensional structure of any GTPase domain. (iii) Identification of sequence regions, other than the effector loop and the nucleotide binding site, that may be involved in the functional cycle: they are loop L4, known to change conformation after GTP hydrolysis; helix alpha 2, especially Arg-73 and Met-67 in ras p21; loops L8 and L10, including ras p21 Arg-123, Lys-147, and Leu-120; and residues located spatially near the N and C termini. These regions are candidate sites for interaction either with the GTP/GDP exchange factor, with a GTPase-affected function, or with a molecule delivered to a destination site with the aid of the GTPase domain.\r"

Insertions that have fused lacZ to an open reading frame are lac+ because they express the truncated lacZ. In the presence of the phage P1 cyclization recombinase cre, the transposon can delete the URA3, tetA, and lacZ genes between the two loxP sites. The remaining short imperfect palindrome contains the ends of Tn3 and a loxP site and does not contain a translational termination codon in the correct reading frame. We have analyzed several insertions within the yeast HO gene. Several insertions inactivate HO and prohibit initiation of mating-type switching. In contrast, an epitope inserted in the central portion encodes a functional HO endonuclease.\r"

  ".W": "To comprehend the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of the cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP)-dependent cellulose synthase of Acetobacter xylinum and its relatedness to similar enzymes in other organisms, the structure of this enzyme was analyzed at the polypeptide level. The enzyme, purified 350-fold by enzyme-product entrapment, contains three major peptides (90, 67, and 54 kDa), which, based on direct photoaffinity and immunochemical labeling and amino acid sequence analysis, are constituents of the native cellulose synthase. Labeling of purified synthase with either [32P]c-di-GMP or [alpha-32P]UDP-glucose indicates that activator- and substrate-specific binding sites are most closely associated with the 67- and 54-kDa peptides, respectively, whereas marginal photolabeling is detected in the 90-kDa peptide. However, antibodies raised against a protein derived from the cellulose synthase structural gene (bcsB) specifically label all three peptides. Further, the N-terminal amino acid sequences determined for the 90- and 67-kDa peptides share a high degree of homology with the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene. We suggest that the structurally related 67- and 54-kDa peptides are fragments proteolytically derived from the 90-kDa peptide encoded by bcsB. The anti-cellulose synthase antibodies crossreact with a similar set of peptides derived from other cellulose-producing microorganisms and plants such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Rhizobium leguminosarum, mung bean, peas, barley, and cotton. The occurrence of such cellulose synthase-like structures in plant species suggests that a common enzymatic mechanism for cellulose biogenesis is employed throughout nature.\r"

If this model is applied to physical therapy, the relationship between impairments and functional limitations is identified as the primary diagnostic focus of physical therapy. Exploration and expansion of this model may best serve the development of a classification scheme for physical therapy diagnosis.\r"

In experiment 2, subjects were randomly assigned to either an eccentric or a concentric exercise group and both groups exercised with maximal effort. Muscle soreness ratings, obtained by using a visual analogue scale, were taken immediately before exercise and at 24 and 48 hours postexercise. Changes in muscle soreness ratings between exercise groups from preexercise to postexercise periods were compared in both experiments, using a one-way between-subjects analysis of variance. There was no difference in the change in muscle soreness from preexercise to post-exercise periods between groups exercising at equal power levels. Subjects who exercised using eccentric contractions with maximal effort demonstrated greater increases in muscle soreness than those who performed concentric contractions. The results suggest that exercise intensity, rather than contraction type, may be the dependent factor in producing exercise-induced muscle soreness.\r"

Trials were completed with both medium- and large-sized hemispheres under the platform while electromyographic surface recordings were made from the three muscles of interest. Electromyographic values, normalized within individuals as a percentage of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), ranged from 20% to 80% of MVIC. An analysis of variance for the average myoelectric signals from all three muscles revealed no differences between the two groups. Effects of direction and hemisphere size were shown for all muscles. The large hemisphere produced significantly greater average activity and a more pronounced effect on the tibialis anterior muscle. The data provide information on the level of muscle activity required for conditions used in this study and may assist the physical therapist with making judgments about the use of this device in rehabilitation programs.\r"

The fate of the free bone grafts was then evaluated at 90 days postoperatively by microangiographic, histologic, and fluorochrome bone-labeling techniques. Sequestration, necrosis, and failure to heal to recipient osseous margins was observed both clinically and histologically in all nontreated irradiated graft sites as well as those receiving simultaneous angiogenic stimulation at the time of graft placement. No fluorescent activity was seen in these graft groups. In the recipient sites pretreated with basic fibroblast growth factor prior to placement of the graft, healing and reestablishment of mandibular contour occurred in nearly 50 percent of the animals. Active bone formation was evident at cortical margins adjacent to the recipient sites but was absent in the more central cancellous regions of the grafts.\r"

To avoid these undesirable results, microsurgical free vascularized toenail transfer was performed in 10 patients, 3 for congenital nail absence and 7 for traumatic nail defects. Patient age averaged 17 years (range 2 to 32 years). In contrast with previous reports, the whole big or second toenail complex without pulp was used in reconstruction. All 10 nails were successfully transferred with complete survival. No digits required reexploration. There were no donor- or recipient-site problems. Follow-up averaged 3 years, with a range of 14 months to 5 years and 4 months. Appropriate nail growth occurred in the congenital patients. No atrophy of the nail complex was found as long as sufficient bony support was present (9 of 10 cases). Whole free vascularized toenail transfers for reconstruction of congenital and traumatic nailbed defects achieve excellent aesthetic results while maintaining normal hand function.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective, randomized study was undertaken to determine if mechanical care of early human bites alone is sufficient therapy in the compliant patient or if prophylactic antibiotics (oral versus parenteral) are indicated. Beginning in June of 1985, patients presenting with human bites of the hand were entered into the study if (1) the bite was less than 24 hours old, (2) the patient was free of infection, (3) the bite did not penetrate the joint capsule, and (4) there was no injury to tendon. Forty-eight patients were ultimately segregated into one of three study groups after standardized ER mechanical wound care. Fifteen patients received an oral placebo, with 7 developing infection (46.7 percent). Sixteen patients received an oral antibiotic, and 17 patients received parenteral antibiotics. No infections were found in either of these latter groups. The results statistically substantiate that mechanical wound care alone is insufficient therapy. Oral antibiotics appear to be equal to intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis. From a cost-benefit standpoint, vigorous cleaning, debridement, and coverage with a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic are adequate care for an uncomplicated bite in the compliant patient.\r"

Seven patients with upper arm injuries and four patients with forearm injuries were treated with latissimus dorsi pedicle flaps. All cases involved massive soft-tissue loss and open fractures. Primary healing of wounds occurred without complications in 10 of 11 patients; the eleventh developed a wound infection. There were no instances of flap loss or vascular complications. This report compares and discusses surgical management options and details the importance of robust, immediate soft-tissue coverage for optimal functional recovery. Contrary to traditional thought, delay in definitive wound closure may be unnecessary when aggressive debridement is followed by acute flap closure.\r"

The present study was designed to test this hypothesis through the application of pharmacologic agents reported to minimize scar contraction. Thirty-six 6-week-old rabbits were divided into six groups: unoperated controls, rabbits with surgically created defects left unrepaired (surgical controls), and four groups of rabbits with surgically created defects with lip repair and wide undermining on the maxillary surface. Animals with lip repair received either no injections or labial subcutaneous injections of distilled water (route-of-injection controls), normal saline, or papaverine hydrochloride for 2 weeks postoperatively. Rabbits with lip repair and saline or papaverine injections showed significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased lip pressure, relatively hypotonic orbicularis oris muscle EMG activity on the cleft lip side, and greater anteroposterior facial growth (assessed radiologically) from 2 to 24 weeks postoperatively compared with rabbits with lip repair and postoperatively compared with rabbits with lip repair and no injections or distilled water injections. Preliminary results suggest that wound contraction following lip repair and soft-tissue undermining may contribute to mid-facial growth inhibition, which may be reduced by pharmacologic manipulations in the rabbit model.\r"

In this high-energy group, five cases of high-energy orbital dislocations, some representing examples of traumatic hypertelorbitism, were observed. They represent 1.5 percent of the 342 midface fractures observed and 4.8 percent of the naso-orbital ethmoid fractures observed (105 patients). One additional patient is described who was seen at the UCLA Medical Center for late repair of the condition. High-energy impacts of the upper midface created fractures of both orbits, zygomas, and nasoethmoidal regions permitting lateral transposition, enlargement, and divergence of the orbits. Interorbital, intercanthal, and interpupillary distances were increased, criteria that confirm the diagnosis of hypertelorbitism. Fifty percent of the patients were bilaterally blind, and one patient sustained unilateral blindness.\r"

  ".W": "Trauma to the face frequently results in internal orbital fractures that may produce large orbital defects involving multiple walls. Accurate anatomic reconstruction of the bony orbit is essential to maintain normal appearance and function of the eye following such injuries. Autogenous bone grafts do not always produce predictable long-term support of the globe. Displacement and varying amounts of bone-graft resorption can lead to enophthalmos. This study examines the use of Vitallium mesh in the acute reconstruction of internal orbital defects. Fifty-four patients with 66 orbits underwent reconstruction of internal orbital defects with Vitallium mesh. Associated fractures were anatomically reduced and rigidly fixed. Forty-six patients and 57 orbits had adequate follow-up for analysis of results. The average follow-up was 9 months, with 85 percent of the patients followed 6 months or longer. There were no postoperative orbital infections, and none of the Vitallium mesh required removal. Large internal orbital defects can be reconstructed using Vitallium mesh with good results and little risk of infection. Vitallium mesh appears to be well tolerated in spite of free communication with the sinuses. Stable reconstruction of the internal orbit can be achieved and predictable eye position maintained without donor-site morbidity.\r"

Resulting deformities consisted of chin ptosis and bizarre soft-tissue pogonial bunching and dimpling in repose or on animation in 9 of the 10 patients (90 percent). Asymmetrical motion of the lower lip was noted by 5 of the 10 patients. Two patients complained of pain and tenderness over the soft-tissue pogonion. The \"bizarre\" soft-tissue chin deformities, once established, are virtually uncorrectable.

Initial diagnostic evaluation is directed at determining the size and anatomic extent of the hemangioma; clinical assessment of coagulation and hemodynamic status is also performed. Arteriography with superselective embolization precedes the surgical procedure, usually by 24 hours. The YAG laser with contact sapphire-tip scalpels is then utilized for resection and reconstruction of the hemangioma. Total removal of hemangioma was achieved in 9 of 13 patients, and partial or subtotal removal was achieved in the remainder. Blood loss and complications were minimal.\r"

The injuries were tangentially excised and immediately covered with split-thickness skin grafts. Detailed consecutive results are presented. The patients can be divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of small subdermal or circumscribed deep dermal burns of the face (n = 8). Healing was quick. Some patients developed signs of overgrafting. As a late result, unevenness and discoloration were seen. Group 2 consisted of mixed deep dermal and subdermal burns of the face and neck (n = 5). Usually, minor areas had to be regrafted. Some patients developed hypertrophic scars at border areas. In the completely excised and grafted area, the skin was smooth, pliable, and discolored. Group 3 consisted mostly of subdermal burns of the face and neck (n = 3). The surgical trauma was significant. Small areas had to be regrafted. Ectropion and microstomia developed. It is concluded that in selected cases of deep dermal and subdermal burns, early excision and skin grafting will result in faster healing and less scarring than expectant treatment.\r"

Systemic antibiotics have been continued only for a short-term course of 14 days postoperatively. There has been no recurrence of infection, with follow-up ranging between 6 months and 3 1/4 years. One patient has undergone reimplantation of a second custom hip prosthesis into the vascularized bed of a free latissimus dorsi muscle flap.\r"

  ".W": "Computed tomography (CT) is clearly more sensitive than chest radiography or conventional linear tomography in the detection of pulmonary metastases. Routine chest CT scans may reveal peripheral nodules as small as 2-3 mm, and high-resolution CT may demonstrate lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Specificity remains a problem, but attention to clinical factors, such as the type of extrathoracic malignancy (ETM), epidemiology, patient age, and prior treatment, should be of assistance. CT is useful in the evaluation of an apparent solitary pulmonary nodule or an equivocal radiographic finding. For single or multiple nodules, CT is essential for planning invasive procedures such as biopsy or surgical resection. Routine CT scanning to screen for occult metastases is indicated only for patients with ETMs that have a high propensity for metastasizing to the lungs and for which detection of pulmonary metastases would influence therapy--bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, most pediatric tumors, choriocarcinoma, nonseminomatous testicular carcinoma, and possibly advanced melanoma. Future large prospective studies evaluating individual malignancies are needed to assess the impact on long-term survival of early detection of pulmonary metastases with CT.\r"

Transrectal sonograms demonstrated hypoechoic lesions that did not represent cancer in 25 of 160 patients examined. All lesions were contralateral to the carcinoma. Pathologic correlation was found in 24 of the 25 lesions. The results of this study show that contralateral hypoechoic lesions in patients with pathologically proved prostatic cancer do not necessarily imply bilateral tumor involvement; they accounted for benign lesions that mimicked the sonographic appearance of malignant tumors and thus produced a false-positive rate for cancer in the contralateral lobe of 16% of patients (25 of 160) with clinical stage B cancer.\r"

The relationships of systolic and diastolic velocities to spectral waveform changes in the penile arteries in response to tumescence were studied before and after intracorporal injection of vasoactive medications that induce erection. In normal subjects, a characteristic spectral waveform pattern corresponded to increasing intracorporal pressure. Patients with abnormal arterial inflow and/or abnormal venous sinusoidal leakage demonstrated deviation from the patterns noted in normal subjects. Patients with abnormal arterial inflow had lower mean peak systolic velocities than normal subjects. Patients with severe venous sinusoidal incompetence had an arrest of waveform progression with evolution to but not beyond phases 1 or 2 (diastolic flow remained positive). Patients with abnormal arterial inflow and abnormal venous sinusoidal outflow had waveform changes that reflected both processes. Systolic/diastolic velocity and waveform relationships can be used to define the integrity of both the cavernosal artery inflow and venous sinusoidal outflow occlusion mechanisms.\r"

The consequences are critical for gradient waveform designed to minimize motion artifact contaminations from time-dependent motion sensitivity. To resolve this discrepancy with a test case (the monopolar waveform of a commonly used, discretely pulsed encoding phase gradient), computer integration of the fundamental Bloch equations for MR imaging with motion was performed. Simulation images for constant and erratic motion showed almost complete agreement with the predictions of the transport integral solutions for motion phase sensitivity; the artifact was solely time-of-flight oblique flow misregistration. Conventional method-of-moments gradient moment nulling compensations produced greater motion artifacts in experiments than did use of no waveform compensation at all. Transport equation solutions implied second-integral zeroing instead; these modifications eliminated the artifacts.\r"

Because the section direction typically has the poorest resolution, reduction of section misregistration can improve lesion contrast. Lesions occur at random sites; hence, to reduce misregistration, it is necessary to repeat imaging with a small amount of offset. This is impractical. Therefore, a reconstruction algorithm that yields offset sections was implemented, in which sections were produced with a zero- and a half-section shift. This algorithm was tested in 14 patients with multiple sclerosis. As expected, because of randomness associated with section placement relative to lesions, the half-shifted sections provided greater contrast as often as the zero-shifted sections. The combined set improved contrast significantly in 39% of lesions; improvement was greatest in lesions with lesser contrast. Signal-to-noise ratios were not affected by this process, which appears to be useful in magnetic resonance image reconstruction.\r"

Laser and balloon angioplasty failures were encountered in heavily calcified plaques or after perforations and dissections. Complications included perforations (19%), hematomas (5%), thromboses (4%), and distal embolizations (4%). Real-time fluorescence spectroscopy identified thrombus, white fibrous plaque, and media but could not avoid perforations in many cases because laser wire advancement outdistanced fluorescence sensing. Disruption of tissue by means of pressure transients and/or mechanical advancement occurred in at least 36% of lesions where the laser energy was insufficient (less than 0.4 J/cm) to ablate significant tissue. Integration of fluorescence guidance with pulsed dye laser ablation is feasible, but additional refinements are necessary to increase safety and efficacy.\r"

In chronic infarctions, Gd-DTPA polylysine had no discernible effect on the SI of the central infarction zone. Overall, it caused no significant hemodynamic effects.

In the 28 patients with thymoma, the sensitivity was 71%; the specificity, 94%. In the 11 patients with germ cell tumors, the sensitivity was 91%; specificity, 98%. The sensitivity in the 33 patients with metastatic disease was 70%; specificity, 100%. The cytologic specimens were examined with light microscopy and the Papanicolaou method only, a limitation that explains the difficulty in differentiating lymphoma from thymoma and that can now be overcome with immunohistochemical study. TNB of anterior mediastinal masses is useful in metastatic disease and germ cell tumors. Lymphoma and thymoma are less reliably diagnosed unless immunohistochemical cytologic methods are applied.\r"

Thirty-three of the abscesses (94%) were demonstrated at US, while two lesions were not depicted. At US, lung abscesses were depicted as hypoechoic lesions with irregular outer margins and an abscess cavity that was manifested as a hyperechoic ring. Twenty-five abscesses (71%) had local adhesion to parietal pleura (lesion-pleura symphysis). US-guided transthoracic needle aspiration of fluid from the abscess cavity was performed successfully in 31 of 33 patients (94%). A total of 65 pathogens were isolated from 31 aspirates (41 anaerobes and 24 aerobes), not-withstanding the fact that 23 of the patients had been previously treated with antibiotics. Only two of 65 pathogens (3%) could be recovered from blood culture, seven (11%) from sputum culture, and two from bronchoalveolar lavage (3%). Two patients developed minimal pneumothorax. The authors conclude that US examination and US-guided transthoracic aspiration are useful and safe diagnostic methods of collecting specimens to enable accurate diagnosis of lung abscesses.\r"

The crude frequency of AE overall was 19.5% (55 patients). In 21 patients (7.4%) AE was transient; 34 patients (12.1%) had persistent AE, which is the focus of this article. The 5-year actuarial incidence of persistent AE was 16%. The crude risk of persistent severe AE was 3.9%. Various factors were examined for their ability to enable prediction of AE. Treatment-related factors did not significantly enable prediction of AE, whereas factors related to patient size, such as body mass index, were strongly associated with both the frequency and severity of AE.\r"

This finding was noted bilaterally in six patients and unilaterally in four patients. No two ossicles were identical. Histologically, no growth plate cartilage was evident between the bony structure and the acromion proper; therefore, this appeared to represent a \"pseudoepiphysis.\" Superficially, this normal variation may appear similar to an acromial fracture resulting from infant abuse. However, a careful analysis of the findings of this normal variation should help prevent any confusion with inflicted injury.\r"

All 12 boys and girls underwent anteroposterior and lateral chest radiography at admission and at varying intervals thereafter. Ten patients underwent V/Q lung scanning; six of these procedures were performed within 4 weeks of initial radiography. Six patients underwent follow-up V/Q scanning. Thoracic computed tomography was performed in four patients at admission. In all 12 cases gradual improvement in symptoms was paralleled by improvements in serial chest radiographs and, in six cases, by improvements in V/Q scans. The affected lobe appeared to be less hyperinflated on follow-up radiographs. For those children who showed functional improvement, ventilation improved more than perfusion, as demonstrated on the V/Q scans. At initial radiography the adjacent \"collapsed\" lobe was seen to function well, suggesting that it was only compressed.\r"

Ninety-seven patients (45%) underwent coarctation resection with end-to-end anastomosis; 92 (43%), subclavian-flap angioplasties; and 26 (12%), synthetic-patch repairs. Sixty-four patients (30%) had an \"aneurysm,\" defined as a measurement ratio of repair site to diaphragmatic aorta greater than 1.5. Transverse-arch or isthmic hypoplasia or recoarctation was detected in 86 patients (40%) and was most commonly associated with septal defects or obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Pullback systolic pressure gradients at catheterization were significantly higher (P = .0001) in the patients with transverse-arch hypoplasia and recoarctation than in those with ratios of transverse arch to diaphragmatic aorta greater than 0.9. Significant postoperative arch obstructions can be predicted with measurement ratios on the basis of the diameter of the abdominal aorta.\r"

CT helped to diagnose appendicitis (64 patients) and nonspecific right lower quadrant inflammation (five patients) and to rule out appendicitis (31 patients). CT had a 98% sensitivity, an 83% specificity, and a 93% accuracy. In 17 of 31 patients without CT evidence of appendicitis, other conditions explaining their symptoms were detected.

They prospectively evaluated 42 patients with MS and 127 control patients with other PWDs. Ninety-three percent of the MS patients demonstrated confluent and/or focal lesions involving the callosal-septal interface (CSI). These lesions characteristically involved the inferior aspect of the callosum and radiated from the ventricular surface into the overlying callosum. CSI lesions were optimally demonstrated on sagittal long repetition time (TR)/short echo time (TE) images and frequently (45% of cases) went undetected on axial images. Only 2.4% of the control patients had lesions of the CC. The authors conclude that midsagittal long TR/short TE images are highly sensitive and specific for MS and that callosal involvement in MS is more common than previously reported.\r"

For most patients, pre- and postoperative spin-echo MR images were obtained with long repetition times (TRs) at 1.5 T. The long TR images obtained before surgery demonstrated unilateral masses involving the dentate nucleus. Long TR images obtained after surgical resection of the dentate nucleus showed increased signal intensity in all of seven contralateral red nuclei, three of seven ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncles, and two of seven contralateral inferior olivary nuclei. Three other patients who underwent surgery for cerebellar neoplasms without resection of the dentate nuclei showed no postoperative brain stem changes on MR images. The authors speculate that the changes in the contralateral red nuclei are due to cerebellorubral degeneration (since well-described neural tracts interconnect the dentate nucleus and the contralateral red nucleus). Injury of the dentate nucleus may result in degeneration of distant neural connections.\r"

T1- and T2-weighted images also were obtained for evaluation of myelination. Diffusional anisotropy was demonstrated in white matter in the adults. Extensive signal attenuation was observed when gradients were parallel to white matter fibers. Conversely, in neonates, diffusional anisotropy of white matter, in which no myelination was shown on T1- and T2-weighted images, was weak. Diffusional anisotropy was more distinct after brain maturation, as observed in adult white matter. Detection of diffusional anisotropy is useful in evaluating neonatal brain development and various white matter disorders.\r"

The normal articulation was well depicted with MR imaging. Findings of sacroiliitis were identified in 20 sacroiliac joints (12 patients). MR imaging findings characteristic of sacroiliitis included abnormal cartilage signal intensity (95% of joints) and erosions (75% of joints) on T1-weighted images. Areas of increased intensity in the articulation (80% of joints) or in erosions (60% of joints) were seen on T2-weighted images. MR imaging was superior to CT for evaluation of cartilage and detection of erosions. Four sacroiliac joints (20%) and two patients (17%) with MR imaging findings of sacroiliitis were negative at CT.

Five of seven patients with anterior spinal column injuries showed characteristic separation of the disk from the vertebral end plate, lesions still evident as late as 9 months after injury. The demonstration of this type of lesion and its delayed resolution may have prognostic and surgical implications. These lesions, anterior longitudinal ligament injuries, anterior annular tears, and occult anterior vertebral end-plate fractures usually occurred at multiple levels except when preexistent degenerative disk narrowing reduced spine mobility. Seven patients had acute cervical disk herniations causing cord impingement. Radiographically occult injuries are well demonstrated with MR imaging, and findings correspond to previously described surgical and anatomical pathologic conditions.\r"

FNH-liver signal-difference-to-noise ratios were quantified; the features of the central scar were qualitatively analyzed. On SE T2-weighted images, all FNHs were hyperintense; in two cases the central scar exhibited a high signal intensity associated with hypointense areas corresponding to fibrous tissue within the branches of the scar. Unenhanced TurboFLASH images always demonstrated the FNHs as hypointense and always depicted the central scar as a hypointense area within the lesion. After bolus injection, arterial enhancement of FNH was clearly seen, and in 10 of 25 lesions, enhancement within the scar was seen 40-80 seconds after injection. Both unenhanced and enhanced TurboFLASH sequences produced the best signal-difference-to-noise ratios in comparison with T2-weighted images.\r"

  ".W": "The authors performed densitometry of the vertebral bodies in 152 patients undergoing renal hemodialysis and histologically examined four vertebrae from cadavers. Bone mineral density (BMD) values were found to be potentially misleading because the vertebrae are often heterogeneous, and the BMD value is merely an average value from one region of interest. To overcome this problem, the authors designed a computed tomographic classification that divides vertebral density distribution patterns into the following five types: normal (type 1), osteopenia (type 2), diffuse osteosclerosis (type 3), spotty osteosclerosis (type 4), and central osteosclerosis (type 5). This classification may be useful in the evaluation of bone changes in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The type 5 pattern is thought to be strongly related to secondary hyperparathyroidism and was often seen in younger patients and women. Many patients with aluminum-induced osteopathy had type 2 patterns, with decreased BMD in cortical bone.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and radiographic findings of four patients with multicentric giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone and Paget disease were retrospectively reviewed. Three patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation; all patients underwent computed tomography (CT). The MR characteristics of the bone component in pagetic GCT appeared to reflect the pagetic phase; a sclerotic pattern was largely represented by hypointense marrow signal intensity on images obtained with both long and short repetition times (TRs) and echo times (TEs). Conversely, a tumor appearing in a mixed pagetic phase demonstrated more heterogeneous signal intensity with all pulse sequences. Extensive soft-tissue components, noted in all cases, showed largely intermediate signal intensity on short TR/TE images and foci of increased signal intensity on longer TR/TE images. In most cases, dramatic reduction in tumor bulk was noted with the use of steroids alone. An awareness of this entity is important because the appearance of lytic lesions with soft-tissue extension in patients with Paget disease does not necessarily imply a grave prognosis. Serial CT or MR imaging is helpful in monitoring the remissions and exacerbations that reflect response to therapy in Paget disease and GCT.\r"

Techniques borrowed from information theory were used to measure the clinical information contributed by radiologists as they interpreted chest radiographs. The reported findings were evaluated in light of the discharge diagnosis. The scores generated quantified the information contributed to the final diagnosis by the radiologist's description. This audit approach was tested in a group of 100 chest radiographs. Significant differences were found in the mean scores for information contributed by five different readers. These differences were similar to differences demonstrated in audits by means of multiple readings of chest radiographs. These results support use of a form of audit that is substantially less expensive and time consuming than that typically used in radiology departments.\r"

Hepatic uptake of SPIO measured with relaxometry decreased dramatically with histologic grade, while splenic uptake increased; the same results were achieved by calculating K values. Imaging of 13 tumorous cirrhotic rats confirmed these results by showing a muted decrease in liver signal intensity on spin-echo images after injection of SPIO. Nevertheless, all intrahepatic tumors could be visualized, as confirmed by postmortem examination. On gradient-echo images, postinjection contrast between the tumor and the liver was not affected by cirrhosis. Thus, despite strong impairment of hepatic uptake in cirrhosis, the diagnostic efficacy of MR imaging with SPIO did not seem to be significantly affected.\r"

Condoms filled with 100 mL of contrast medium at four different iodine concentrations (30%, 15%, 7.5%, and 3.8% [wt/vol]) and containing up to five 4-mm-thick gallstones or a single 10-mm-thick gallstone were radiographed in a 20-cm-deep water bath by using four kilovolt peak settings (70, 80, 90, and 100 kVp). Images were read by three radiologists who were blinded to the radiographic technique. significantly (P less than .05) improved Decreasing iodine concentration significantly (P less than .05) improved detection of 4-mm-thick gallstones at a constant kilovolt peak setting. However, increasing the kilovolt peak setting while using the same concentration of contrast medium had no statistically significant influence on gallstone detectability, although radiologists did indicate a preference for the high-kilovolt peak technique. Results of the authors' experiments showed that for detection of small gallstones at injection cholecystography, use of a low-concentration contrast medium and a high kilovolt peak setting is the recommended radiographic technique.\r"

One stone from each set was incubated in one of the four solvents at 37 degrees C. Solvents were changed at 30-minute intervals. The study was stopped either when the stones were completely dissolved or at the end of 7 hours. Any residual fragments were weighed, reimaged, and reanalyzed for content. There were no statistical differences between dissolution times of the stones in MTBE compared with those in the three new solvents. Ethyl propionate and n-propyl acetate appear to be as efficacious as MTBE in dissolving cholesterol stones and could be attractive alternatives for gallstone chemolysis.\r"

Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) showed dilatation of the biliary ducts, some with wall thickening, thickening of the gallbladder wall and pericholecystic fluid. Cholangiograms showed attenuation and pruning of the intrahepatic bile ducts, some with beading and dilatation of the common bile duct. Three patients had papillary stenosis. Numerous Cryptosporidium organisms were found in three resected gallbladders and in the biliary ducts of seven patients in whom autopsy was performed, accompanied by an exuberant inflammatory response.

The enlarged colon wall was most commonly shown as a wide band of heterogeneous medium echogenicity surrounded by a narrow hypoechoic layer. Pathologic correlations proved that the wide inner stratum represented severely edematous submucosa and mucosa, while the outer layer depicted the muscularis propria. Almost complete effacement of the lumen of the colon occurred secondary to the mural edema in 69% of the cases. The dearth of intraluminal gas combined with thickening of the colon wall and ascites facilitated excellent sonographic evaluation. The diagnosis of PMC is strongly suggested by the presence of these sonographic features in a patient with watery diarrhea and a history of antibiotic therapy.\r"

A definitive diagnosis was made when a cyst that was hyperintense on T1-weighted images exhibited hypointense signal on T2-weighted images (shading) or when the lesion consisted of multiple hyperintense cysts on T1-weighted images (multiplicity) regardless of the signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Surgery was performed in 293 patients, and confirmation was obtained in 354 lesions. MR imaging enabled accurate diagnosis of 77 of 86 endometrial cysts and exclusion of the diagnosis of endometrial cyst in 263 of 268 other gynecologic masses with or without internal hemorrhage. The overall diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 90%, 98%, 96%, respectively.

It is likely that a basement membrane defect allows cyst formation in multiple organs, presumably including the seminal vesicles. Because of the association of seminal vesicle cysts with ipsilateral urogenital anomalies, and because only 60% of patients with APKD have a relevant familial history, the kidneys of patients with cross-sectional imaging evidence of seminal vesicle cysts should also be studied.\r"

These peripheral high-intensity rims were not associated with subject age or with size, location, or degeneration of the leiomyomas. Histologic examination revealed markedly dilated lymphatic vessels, dilated veins, edema, or a combination of these features to correspond to the location of the high-intensity rims. These benign causes of high intensity in the myometrium should not be confused with clinically important processes such as adenomyosis or invasion by endometrial carcinoma.\r"

Four patients demonstrated renal lesions that enhanced after gadolinium administration. A total of five lesions in these four patients were surgically resected and found to be renal cell carcinoma at pathologic examination. The fifth patient was spared surgery because a hyperattenuated lesion noted at nonenhanced CT did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium, indicating a benign cyst. Five incidentally occurring benign cysts removed at the time of nephrectomy in two of the patients did not demonstrate enhancement with gadolinium on MR images. Serial serum creatine levels were obtained before and after gadolinium administration in all patients; no changes were noted after gadolinium administration. Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is an effective method for characterizing renal lesions in patients with renal insufficiency. At the usual dosage, there appears to be no nephrotoxic reaction in these patients.\r"

The endorectal coil provided a markedly improved signal-to-noise ratio, enabling the use of small fields of view; thus, the images had significantly improved in-plane resolution. The images were assigned an MR imaging stage based on the clinical staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Vaginal wall, vaginal fornix, parametrium, and pelvic side-wall invasion by tumor were all well demonstrated. When compared with body coil images, the endorectal coil images provided increased anatomic detail and demonstrated tissue planes between tumor and normal structures that were not seen on the body coil images. This preliminary investigation indicates that use of an endorectal surface coil is a promising technique to obtain high-resolution images of the female genital tract. This technique has the potential to improve the accuracy of staging for cervical carcinoma.\r"

The contrast agent used was randomly selected and selectively injected after unilateral catheterization; the contralateral side was used for control. Pathologic inspection of right and left uteri with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries was done without knowledge of side of catheterization or duration of time since catheterization. The degree and location of inflammation were noted. Inflammation disappeared by 4 days in five of seven contrast agents. Iothalamate meglumine 60% and iopamidol required 2 weeks for disappearance of inflammation. Essentially no inflammation was associated at any time with ioxaglate. These findings suggest that all of these contrast agents would be clinically acceptable for direct injection into the human fallopian tube.\r"

Although the risks associated with firearms are well known, the hazards related to deer stands are not widely appreciated. From September 1982 through December 1989, there were 19 patients admitted to the Medical College of Georgia Hospital and Clinics for injuries sustained from falls related to deer stands. One death occurred, and six of the 18 survivors remain paralyzed. Data from 18 of these patients showed that 83% of these falls (15/18) were associated with hunter-constructed stands. Structural failure accounted for 39% (7/18) of the accidents; other causes included carelessness, falling asleep, and medical events. Four of the 19 patients (21%) had elevated blood alcohol levels on admission. Fracture of the spine and long bones accounted for the majority of the injuries, and seven of the 18 survivors (39%) were hospitalized for more than 4 weeks. Eight of the survivors (44%) remain permanently disabled. Deer-stand-related falls may result in significant long-term disability, expensive and lengthy hospitalization, and even death. A preventive approach to these injuries is paramount, and published guidelines for safety while hunting from deer stands should be followed.\r"

Complications requiring operative intervention and not directly related to the burn wound occur frequently but are easily overlooked. To determine the nature and frequency of these complications, we conducted a retrospective study of all burn cases in our burn unit over a 5-year period. Twenty-three of the 309 patients (7%) had 45 complications not related directly to the burn wound and required surgical intervention or consultation. The population with surgical complications was generally older (52 vs 42 years), more severely burned (36% vs 25% total body surface area), and had a higher mortality (44% vs 13%). Sixteen of the 23 patients with complications had a single surgical problem, while seven patients sustained multiple complications. In six of the 10 deaths, the surgical complication was believed to be either directly related or significantly contributory to the cause of death. Because the number of burn patients requiring surgical intervention is high, burn patients must be thoroughly examined for possible complications.\r"

  ".U": "91271965\r", 
  ".W": "Many have discussed hypertonic saline for resuscitation in burned patients only to discourage its use or to emphasize it only as a research tool and not as standard resuscitation. We reviewed the records of 47 adults with burns over 20% or more of the total body surface area (TBSA) in whom hypertonic saline was used as standard resuscitation fluid in a large community burn unit. The solution consisted of sodium, 300 mEq/L, acetate, 200 mEq/L, and chloride, 100 mEq/L, with an osmolality of 600 mOsm/L. The mean TBSA burned was 37% and the mean patient age was 44.8 years. Eighteen patients (mean age 39.7 years, mean TBSA burned 27%) received hypertonic saline alone. They required an average of 75% of the Parkland calculated volume to achieve a urinary output of 1 mL/kg/hr. The mean hematocrit value over the first 48 hours was 44.2% and the mean serum sodium level was 141.6 mEq/L. Twenty-nine patients (mean age 51.8 years, mean TBSA burned 47.8%) received hypertonic saline plus colloid (albumin or fresh frozen plasma). Colloid was used in older patients with more serious burns. This group required 57% of the Parkland calculated volume to achieve a urinary output of 1 mL/kg/hr. The mean hematocrit value was 45.1% and mean sodium level was 143.8 mEq/L. The mean weight gain for both groups was 7.3% of the admission weight. None of the patients had changes in pH or renal function. All patients survived the resuscitation phase of their injury; the overall death rate was 49%. We conclude that hypertonic saline is a safe, effective means of resuscitation even in a community-based unit. It allows less fluid to be delivered for adequate resuscitation. The usual hyponatremia, hemoconcentration, and significant weight gain associated with administration of isotonic solutions was avoided. Colloid may further improve the resuscitation capabilities of hypertonic saline.\r"

In 15 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, IAP was measured, after 15-minute equilibration intervals, at PEEP levels of 0, 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O. Parametric analysis with multiple paired t tests and nonparametric analysis with Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau tests were used to determine correlation between PEEP and IAP. All patients were male. The mean age was 39 years (range, 18-77). Ten patients had just had laparotomy. No correlation was found between PEEP and IAP. We conclude that PEEP of 15 cm H2O or less has no effect on IAP, and we discuss the clinical implications.\r"

  ".W": "Recommendations concerning postoperative extubation after thymectomy for myasthenia gravis are presently based upon retrospective chart reviews. We present the results of a prospective investigation of time to extubation after thymectomy for 14 patients over a 12-month period based upon a protocol that included preoperative immunologic therapy, combined epidural and general anesthesia, postoperative epidural narcotic analgesia, and a standardized approach to discontinuation of ventilatory support. After a neurologist took measures to optimize preoperative neuromuscular function, all 14 patients received agents to produce lumbar epidural anesthesia and light general anesthesia. Muscle relaxants were avoided in all but one patient. Postoperative analgesia was initially maintained with epidural hydromorphone, then therapy was switched to patient-controlled intravenous morphine sulfate. Criteria for weaning from mechanical ventilation, first measured at the end of anesthesia, were partial pressure of oxygen (arterial) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.40), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (arterial) less than or equal to 50 mm Hg, pH greater than or equal to 7.30, and respiratory rate less than or equal to 30 breaths/min. If these criteria were not met, ventilatory support was continued postoperatively with intermittent mandatory ventilation, and the patient was weaned gradually from this support. Criteria for extubation included meeting the criteria for weaning, vital capacity greater than or equal to 10 mL/kg, and inspiratory pressure better than -30 cm H2O. Criteria for reintubation included tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 40 breaths/min), respiratory acidosis not due to narcotics, or vital capacity less than or equal to 8 mL/kg. The mean time to extubation was 9 hours (range, 0.75 to 25 hours). Mean preoperative vital capacity was 2.59 +/- 0.64 L (range, 1.90 to 4.20), which decreased approximately 50% to 1.19 +/- 0.39 L (range, 0.70 to 2.0) at the time of extubation. No patient required reintubation. Half of the patients required postoperative anticholinesterase therapy based upon serial neurologic examinations; there were no instances of cholinergic crisis. Thirteen patients returned to the ward on the first postoperative day, and one on the second day. Thirteen patients preferred epidural analgesia to patient-controlled analgesia. The time to extubation and average length of stay in an intensive care setting were markedly reduced compared to those reported in previous retrospective studies. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach that optimizes neuromuscular function and decreases poststernotomy pulmonary insult will shorten the time to extubation and decrease the length of stay in the intensive care or recovery room after thymectomy.\r"

Textured silicone and smooth silicone shells minimally impair detection of artifacts. Polyurethane-coated shells are less radiolucent but allow visualization of some microcalcifications. Saline and silicone-gel-filled implants are radiopaque regardless of shell type. Textured silicone and smooth silicone shells filled with peanut oil are radiolucent and allow visualization of microcalcifications and most soft-tissue masses. These data demonstrate that radiolucent breast implants are possible, and further efforts are under way to achieve Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical testing.\r"

Between 1981 and 1987, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 448 patients (75 black, 373 white) received azathioprine, 3 mg/kg daily; prednisone, 30 mg daily; and intravenous antithymocyte sera, 0.2 mL/kg/day for 14 days, after transplantation. Prednisone doses were decreased gradually to 10 mg daily within 6 months of transplantation. Azathioprine was maintained at doses of 2 to 3 mg/kg/daily; lower doses were administered if significant myelosuppression occurred. One-year graft survival was 72% and 85% among black and white recipients, respectively (P less than .01). Two hundred thirty-six patients have been treated with azathioprine (3 mg/kg initially tapered during the first week to 1.5 to 2 mg/kg); prednisone, 30 mg daily; and cyclosporine, 10 mg/kg per day. Cyclosporine therapy was begun after recipient serum creatinine levels had decreased below 3 mg/dL. Before therapy was initiated and until levels of cyclosporine were maintained between 150 and 200 ng/mL (whole blood), antithymocyte serum was administered. This immunosuppressive protocol resulted in 1-year graft survival of 90% and 87% in black and white recipients, respectively. Not only was graft loss markedly reduced, but the interracial difference noted before the use of cyclosporine was no longer evident. The type of immunosuppressive therapy used clearly affected 1-year allograft survival among black recipients. The combination of azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone resulted in improved graft survival overall, but had the most significant effect among blacks.\r"

The study comprised 52 patients without extrahepatic biliary obstruction; 19 had had cholecystectomy, 18 of whom complained of biliary colic similar to that they had had originally. The other 33 patients had intact, well visualized gallbladders; 15 of these patients had pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, but none had chronic pancreatitis. The average diameter of the common bile duct at its widest point by ultrasonography was 4.8 mm (range, 4.0 to 9.0 mm) in the 33 patients with intact gallbladders, and 5.7 mm (range, 4.0 to 8.0 mm) in the 19 patients who had had cholecystectomy. The diameter by ERCP was 4.4 mm (range, 2.9 to 6.3 mm) in the patients with intact gallbladders, and 11.17 mm (range, 6.9 to 14.7 mm) in the patients who had had cholecystectomy. In each patient who had had cholecystectomy the diameter as measured by ERCP was larger than it appeared by ultrasonography. The results suggest that the common bile duct is distensible, and that this distensibility may be related to the postcholecystectomy syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Most regions of the United States are served by poison control centers that provide 24-hour toxicologic guidance resulting in the home management of most poison exposures. It has been suggested that without public access to a poison control hotline the majority of poison-exposed patients would seek medical care in emergency departments or other outpatient visits. This study compares the patterns of community response to poison exposure in Louisiana before and after the discontinuance of the state poison control service, and also compares these patterns to the situation in Alabama, which maintained poison center services throughout the study period. After discontinuance of the poison control service in Louisiana, poison exposure cases had up to four times the rate of \"self-referral\" to health care facilities and less than half the rate of home management when compared to Alabama cases. Before the closing of the Louisiana center, Alabama and Louisiana triage patterns for poison exposures were nearly identical. The maximum annual cost attributable to unnecessary outpatient service utilization in Louisiana was estimated to be $1.4 million, an amount more than three times the annual poison control center state appropriation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to characterize the obstetric population of the city/county hospital in a midsize southern city. A total of 2013 patients were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody between June 1988 and February 1990, with 1893 negative for both, 105 (5.2%) positive for surface antibody, and 15 (0.8%) positive for surface antigen. Only 25% of the patients with positive results of hepatitis B screening would have been identified by the 1984 Centers for Disease Control risk group criteria, and no other predictive features were identified. We conclude that universal prenatal screening for hepatitis B is indicated in low-risk populations because of the high prevalence and the lack of predictive features.\r"

Antibiotic resistance was as common in patients older than age 60 (24%) as in younger patients (23%). Sensitivity testing by disk diffusion and microdilution techniques on 71 isolates (37 beta-lactamase-positive) showed uniform susceptibility to cefuroxime, cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, and chloramphenicol, but three beta-lactamase-positive isolates were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The high rate of ampicillin resistance noted in elderly patients has implications for the choice of antimicrobial therapy for these infections.\r"

We report the cases of three patients in whom the acute retroviral illness was characterized by transient oral candidiasis and unexplained high lactate dehydrogenase values, with or without transient pulmonary infiltrate, in the context of an acute febrile illness. The clinical findings correlated with a severe reduction in the number of CD4 cells. We believe that thrush could be a marker of acute retroviral infection, as it is not a feature of any other heterophil-negative mononucleosis-like syndrome. We propose that in any patient having transient thrush and acute viral syndrome, the possibility of HIV infection should be aggressively pursued serologically, regardless of the patient's HIV risk status, provided that the usual causes of candidiasis (eg, diabetes mellitus, antibiotic use, and dentures) can be excluded.\r"

Such external fistulas most commonly follow anastomotic leak after gastrointestinal surgery. We identified 58 patients seen over a 5-year period at the University of Louisville Hospitals because of external abdominal fistulas that arose from the stomach (8), duodenum (4), small intestine (26), colon (14), biliary tract (9), and pancreas (7). Fifteen patients had multiple fistulas and 32 had high-output fistulas (greater than 200 mL/day). Closure was achieved in 48 patients, and eight of the 10 patients whose fistulas remained open died. Overall mortality was 19%. Principles of management include control of infection, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, nutritional support, proper wound care, and often operative intervention. Multiple staged operations over many months were particularly important in managing complex wounds with large abdominal wall defects and multiple fistulas. Fistula closure is the ultimate goal, and patience is important to achieve it.\r"

Study subjects were selected from among women whose newborns were of low birth weight. These women were screened for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation. Of the mothers of low-birth-weight neonates, 43% had PLAP values of 2.0 multiples of the median (MoM) or higher; only 22% of the mothers in the control group had such high values. The adjusted odds ratio was 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.5) and was not confounded by race, age, or weight. Odds ratios were improved by selecting more extreme cutoff values, with fewer cases identified as positive. In 14% of the cases of low birth weight, both MSAFP and PLAP values were elevated, compared with 5.6% of those in the control group. These data suggest that PLAP elevations, with or without measurements for MSAFP, may be a useful indicator during the second trimester of pregnancy for the risk of low birth weight.\r"

Hyperactivity is recognized as a common symptom of a variety of childhood disorders. In many instances the symptoms of ADHD signal the onset of severe psychopathology and indicate comorbidity. Because a significant number of children exhibiting symptoms of ADHD are unresponsive to stimulants or have side effects, the use of such drugs is contraindicated. In this article we describe ADHD according to subcategories in an effort to distinguish diverse groups of children with ADHD and to identify those responding best to psychopharmacologic agents other than stimulants. Further understanding of the neurobiology of ADHD is needed to more clearly define and treat this condition.\r"

The two types differ substantially in the long-term mortality. Symptoms and signs do not distinguish between the two types, and small lesions are often asymptomatic. The neoplasms may be discovered during imaging procedures for unrelated complaints. Computerized tomography may suggest the diagnosis of microcystic adenoma or mucinous cystic neoplasm when the features are typical, but the final diagnosis must be established by surgical biopsy. Characteristic gross findings, light microscopic findings, and immunohistochemical staining patterns distinguish between the two types. When preliminary open biopsy confirms microcystic adenoma, extensive unnecessary surgery can be avoided.\r"

The effects of phenothiazines, alcoholism, Wernicke's encephalopathy, Parkinson's disease, and altered mental status contributed to the development of hypothermia in these instances. Although both patients survived and were discharged from the hospital, it is likely that hypothermia in such situations has a higher mortality. Awareness of the broad differential of predisposing conditions is mandatory in treating such patients in a timely fashion.\r"

The simulation analyses revealed that the primary cause of postlaminectomy deformity was the resection of one or more spinous processes and/or posterior ligaments (ie, ligamenta flava, supraspinous, and interspinous ligaments). After their removal, the tensile stresses that were preoperatively distributed through the posterior ligaments were transferred to the facets. This led to an imbalance of the stresses on the spinal bodies, causing deformity. The gravitational center of the head determined whether the deformity would develop as a kyphosis or increasing lordosis. As the elastic modulus of the soft tissue composites (eg, end plates, ligaments, and facets) increased, a kyphotic deformity changed gradually from swan-neck deformity, to extreme kyphotic deformity with a large curvature, and finally to a straightening deformity. Progressive kyphotic deformity is found only in children.\r"

No evidence of osteoporosis was noted by single-photon absorptiometric analysis in the affected sample compared with a normal control group.

The validity was measured in 10 normal subjects by comparison of the angle values obtained with the electrogoniometer with those obtained with the two-inclinometer method previously validated with x-ray measurements. The total range of movement was divided into 5 degree steps, and the angle value obtained with both methods was recorded at each of these steps. The testing procedure was repeated (retest) after removal and reattachment of the electrogoniometer. Because the potentiometer of the electrogoniometer measures angular changes indirectly from changes in the curvature of a flexible slat, a special individual calibration procedure was applied, and computation of the electrogoniometric angles (Ec) representing the dorsolumbar movement was made by software. Regression analysis of Ec in relation to corresponding inclinometric angles gave a slope of 1.03 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.97, indicating a high concurrent validity between the two methods. The intraclass correlation coefficient between test and retest (ICC = 0.982) confirmed the high reproducibility of the measurement procedures. The length of the slat can be changed to adapt the electrogoniometric system to different statures. Under standardized conditions, this new electrogoniometer can provide continuous measurements of sagittal dorsolumbar movements that are reproducible with an accuracy comparable to that obtained with the two-inclinometer method.\r"

The anular laminas from individuals less than 40 years of age consisted of obliquely orientated collagen fibers exhibiting a pennate arrangement. These fibers were intensely argyrophilic after silver nitrate impregnation. The fibers and surrounding substance appeared light pink after exposure to the periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction and blue with alcian blue complex. Beginning during middle age and continuing into the eighth decade, there was a progressive degeneration of the laminas. The breakdown of the intact laminas was characterized by the fraying, splitting, and loss of collagen fibers. The newly formed spaces became filled with intense PAS-positive material. In addition, there was a continual deposition of chondroid substance in the anuluses of the aging discs. This phenomenon was not seen in the young disc. These age related changes lead to a loss of integrity to the disc, which may be a factor in disc pathology.\r"

Subjects with tropism had a significantly higher prevalence of disc degeneration at all three lumbar levels examined (L3-4, L4-5, L5-S1). The average facet angles increased from L3-4 to L4-5 and further to the L5-S1 level. There was no statistically significant relationship between the magnitude of the angle and the presence of disc degeneration at any of the three levels. It was concluded that the risk of disc degeneration is increased in the presence of facet joint tropism.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, the contact loads and regions on facets of a lumbar motion segment are quantitatively determined. The analysis accounts for both material and geometric nonlinearities and treats the facet articulation as a frictionless, nonlinear, moving contact problem. The loadings consist of axial torque and lateral bending acting alone or in combination with axial compression force. Complex loadings simulating symmetric and nonsymmetric liftings are also considered. Under identical magnitude of rotation, axial torque generates the largest contact forces, followed by extension, flexion, and lateral bending. Contact forces under loads simulating heavy symmetric lifting are as, or even larger than, those under large extension and axial torque loadings. The presence of axial and lateral rotations during forward flexion significantly increases the loads transmitted through the compression facet. The tension facet, in this case, became nearly unloaded. The large loads on the facets, predicted especially under nonsymmetric, combined flexion loadings, are likely to play a role in the observed disorders of the facet joints. Under various loadings, the transfer of forces from one facet to the adjacent one occurs through three distinct areas, namely, extension-type, flexion-type, and torsion-type contact areas. The relative magnitude of different components of the transmitted forces are also predicted to vary considerably, depending on these regions of contact.\r"

True sciatica with a dermatomal distribution occurred in only 10 women (1%).

  ".U": "91272057\r", 
  ".W": "In a group of nine sheep (Group A), it was noted that when small, interlocking cancellous and cortical cancellous bone grafts are placed posteriorly on the lumbosacral spine, union always occurred in the interlumbar motion segments and almost never occurred at the lumbosacral joint. One of the main differences in these two areas is the amount of motion that occurs at each level with flexion and extension. Because nonunion following bone grafting for arthrodesis of the spine is a serious clinical problem, we have studied the amount of motion seen at the interlumbar and lumbosacral joints in sheep to ascertain how much motion is compatible with union and how much is associated with nonunion. In vivo studies were carried out in eight sheep (Group B), and five normal spine segments were studied in vitro to determine normal motion in this species. To simplify the complex in vivo motion that occurs at the lumbar motion segments, the simple linear displacement and strain of the fusion mass (consisting of fibrous tissue and bone grafts placed on and between the laminas posteriorly) was measured with the spine in flexion and extension. When the displacement and strain at the interlaminar level of the L6-S1 joint was measured, the linear displacement was found to be 5.2 mm and the associated linear strain 36%. The displacement at the L5-L6 interspace was 1.2 mm, and the strain 10%. The stiffness of the L5-L6 joint (which always fused) and the L6-S1 joint (which did not fuse, with one exception) were also studied. In a third group of four animals (Group C), internal fixation of the lumbosacral joint was attempted in addition to bone grafting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The previous studies were performed in vitro or in vivo during active motion. The aim of this study was to obtain normal values of passively performed segmental motions. Forty-one healthy adults were examined by means of functional radiographs during flexion-extension and lateral bending. A graphic construction method and a computer-assisted method were used to measure rotations. Comparing with recent in vivo studies, the values obtained for normal angles of rotation were predominately larger. This might be due to the passive examination used in the study. The graphic construction method and computer-assisted method techniques are equally reliable, but the computer-assisted method method yields other important kinematic data, such as translations. It is proposed that passive motion be applied during functional examination of patients with suspected instabilities. However, the large variation of rotational values between individuals in the normal population may limit the clinical usefulness of functional lumbar analysis using this parameter. Future studies should explore the clinical relevance of determining altered segmental mobility in low-back pain patients.\r"

  ".W": "Four cases of atlantoaxial dislocation without fracture of the odontoid have now been reported in patients surviving significant trauma. Experience with these cases suggest the following: 1. Atlantoaxial dislocation is compatible with survival and minimal or no long-term neurologic effects. 2. Reduction of the dislocation by traction is possible and has not resulted in significant complications, but marked instability can be present. Close medical supervision and frequent radiographic evaluation is mandatory. During reduction, the weight and angle of traction applied is changed in each phase of reduction (distraction, realignment, release). After reduction, physician-controlled, gentle flexion-extension radiographs are used to assess stability. 3. Traction should be started with light weights, care being taken to avoid overdistraction. A maximum of 15 lb traction was required for reduction in the present case. 4. Posterior surgical fusion is usually necessary because of residual instability and/or incomplete reduction, as demonstrated by postreduction supervised, gentle flexion-extension radiographs and/or CT scan. 5. There may be a small number of patients who can be treated by immobilization alone if a completely stable, anatomic reduction is obtained with traction.\r"

New images were reconstructed from the two images obtained on the different days by superimposition and division in each pixel to get the ratio of cerebral perfusion change. All patients with bypass procedures had an increase in cerebral blood flow in the affected areas, and nine of 10 had an increase in cerebral blood flow in the contralateral cortex. There was no increase in cerebral blood flow in one case with no operation. Neither our procedure nor the results in this small series prove that recovery of function is due to an increase in blood flow, but we believe this is the case.\r"

Preoperatively, pituitary dysfunction was present in 90%, headaches in 80%, hyperprolactinemia in 70%, and visual interference in 40%. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging had 90% and 100% sensitivity, respectively, in disclosing the lesion. The mean follow-up duration was 22 months. There was no mortality. The only morbidity was sustained diabetes insipidus in one case. Resolution or improvement in preoperative dysfunction occurred in the majority of patients: headaches in 100%, visual deficits in 75%, normalization of hyperprolactinemia in 83%, and reversal of panhypopituitarism in 33%. We conclude that Rathke's cleft cysts can be managed safely and effectively with transsphenoidal drainage and partial excision of the wall.\r"

Out of the 26 survivors, all operated upon, 19 had an adequate recovery (score of 0-3 on the expanded Glasgow Outcome Scale). Vigorous resuscitation and early surgery often resulted in useful survivals and occasionally in spectacular recoveries. However, the high mortality rate on the scene or soon after the injury restricted the possibility of effective management to a minority of cases.\r"
