Given the wide range of variances in the ossification centers, the unfused synchondroses, and the relative hypermobility of the pediatric cervical spine, radiographs may be easily misread if one is not thoroughly familiar with the developmental anatomy and variants. This paper discusses those developmental aspects of the pediatric cervical spine that impact on emergency radiographic interpretation. Frequently encountered pediatric cervical spine fracture/dislocations are reviewed with an analysis of age-related distributions. Finally, the syndrome of Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiographic Abnormality (SCIWORA) is discussed.\r"

However, two critical performance criteria upon which a decision to choose one vendor's unit over another could be 1) differences in dysrhythmia recognition sensitivity and specificity and 2) time to delivery of a defibrillation shock. While there appears to be evidence suggesting no significant differences between the three units in terms of dysrhythmia recognition, there do not appear to be any controlled 'time-to-defibrillation' studies. The purpose of this study was to determine if, under controlled conditions, any performance differences existed between these three units in time to delivery of a defibrillation shock. The results of this study suggest that there are no pragmatic differences between the three defibrillation units. In the absence of time-to-defibrillation differences, EMS systems managers can place more emphasis on other features so as to better address the needs, concerns, and resources of their system.\r"

DF-2 infections appear to demonstrate a strong association with dog bites (or recent exposure to dogs) and have a predilection for patients with defective host defenses although immunocompetent individuals are also susceptible. Recently, the first two cases of documented DF-2 infection following cat bite have been reported. Of the cases reported, 42 of the 44 blood cultures grew DF-2. In one of the two cases where blood culture failed to grow DF-2, the bacterium was isolated at the time of operation from an infected myxoma of the tricuspid valve. In the other case, the organism was isolated from the eyelid margin of a case of angular blepharitis. Peripheral blood smears also afford an effective and practical clinical tool for early diagnosis; 9 of 10 patients for whom smears were done tested positive. This paper reviews the epidemiologic, microbiological, and clinical features of this relatively new illness and also offers general guidelines to physicians for clinical management. Health professionals, especially those providing care for high risk groups, should be alerted to this potentially fatal infection.\r"

These data suggest that an in vivo antibody response can be made to type 2 Ag in the absence of Ia-dependent cellular interactions. The surface IgM+IgD-Ia- B cells that are found in the anti-Ia antibody-suppressed mouse may represent an expanded population of Ia-independent, type 2 Ag-sensitive B cells normally present as a smaller proportion of the splenic lymphocyte population. Thymus-dependent responses, which have been shown to have an absolute requirement for an Ia-dependent interaction, are absent in these animals.\r"

The coproduction of IL-2 and IL-4 was confirmed at the mRNA level. Subclones were derived which contained RNA transcripts for, as well as secreted, both IL-2 and IL-4 thus confirming the clonality of the original T cell clones. CD4+ T cell clones that expressed an unrestricted cytokine profile upon Con A stimulation were also isolated from mice immunized to other Ag (hen egg lysozyme, OVA, or type II collagen). These data indicate that CD4+ T cell clones newly isolated from immunized mice do not necessarily segregate into the Th1 and Th2 subsets. We propose this new murine CD4+ cell subset with an unrestricted pattern of cytokine production be called Th0.\r"

  ".W": "Human monocytes express two types of IgG FcR, Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII. These can be assayed by using indicator E sensitized by human IgG (EA-human IgG) or mouse IgG1, (EA-mouse IgG1), respectively. On mouse macrophages, Fc gamma RI is sensitive to trypsin, whereas Fc gamma RII is trypsin resistant. We studied the effects of the proteolytic enzymes pronase and trypsin on human monocyte Fc gamma R. Neither enzyme caused a decrease in rosetting mediated by monocyte Fc gamma RI. Human Fc gamma RII is polymorphic, and monocytes interact either strongly or weakly with mouse IgG1. The interaction of low responder monocytes with mouse IgG1 was dramatically increased (to the level exhibited by high responder monocytes) by protease treatment. The effects of proteases on Fc gamma RII were investigated in more detail by using monocytes from which Fc gamma RI was selectively modulated by using immobilized immune complexes. Proteolysis of such modulated monocytes induced an increased interaction with EA-human IgG. Fc gamma RII appears to mediate this interaction. This conclusion is supported by the observation that after proteolysis, the Fc gamma RII-mediated binding of EA-mouse IgG1 becomes susceptible to inhibition by (monomeric) human IgG. To quantify the effect of proteolytic enzymes on Fc gamma RII, we performed binding studies with cell line K562, that expresses only Fc gamma RII. A significant increase in Ka of Fc gamma RII for dimeric human IgG complexes was observed when K562 cells were treated with protease. To elucidate the mechanism of this enhancement of Ka by proteolysis, we performed immunoprecipitation studies. Neither m.w., nor IEF pattern of Fc gamma RII were influenced by proteolysis. Moreover, the expression of Fc gamma RII was not affected by proteolysis as evidenced by immunofluorescence studies and Scatchard analysis, and neither were Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RIII induced. We conclude that proteolysis increases the affinity of Fc gamma RII for human IgG, and speculate that such a proteolysis-induced change may also occur in vivo, e.g., at inflammatory sites.\r"

When treated on days 0 and 1 with respect to infection with either vaccinia virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus (LCMV) or vesicular stomatitis virus, 6-day immune mice had low numbers of CD8+ T cells that were reduced to about 10% of the values found for infected but otherwise untreated controls. In contrast, the number of CD4+ T cells was within normal ranges. Correspondingly, induction of strictly T help-dependent antiviral neutralizing IgG antibody titers remained unaffected by the mAb treatment, whereas generation of antiviral cytotoxic T cell activity was abrogated. Anti-IL-2R treatment of thymectomized mice 14 and 15 days after infection prevented generation of secondary antiviral cytotoxic T cells in restimulation cultures in vitro initiated 24 days later. Treatment with IL-2R-specific mAb was comparable to treatment with CD8-specific mAb in preventing mice to eliminate virus. Because of the involvement of antiviral cytotoxic T cells in disease manifestations, treatment with IL-2R-specific mAb protected mice from lethal LCM after intracerebral infection with LCMV and inhibited the footpad swelling reaction caused by local infection with the same virus.\r"

The recombinant sporozoite vaccine candidate, R32tet32, contains at least two T epitopes, one located within the repeat region and another in the tet tail. When C57BL/6 (H-2b) and BALB/c (H-2d) mice were sensitized intradermally with R32tet32 or the truncated protein R32LR emulsified in CFA and challenged 5 days later with R32tet32, only H-2b mice recognized a T epitope located within the major repeat sequence (NANP) and encoded by four or less repeats. H-2d mice responded solely to the T epitope located on the tet tail. Ear swelling was maximal at 48 h and revealed a histologic pattern characteristic of DTH. CD4+ T cell lines derived from immunized animals demonstrated the ability to mediate local DTH, proliferate, and secrete lymphokines in response to stimulation with Ag. High dose i.v. administration of R32tet32 in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice before intradermal sensitization with R32tet32 revealed that DTH responses were suppressed only in BALB/c mice. Further experiments localized the suppressive determinant to the tet tail. Collectively, these data indicate that DTH may prove to be a useful method to characterize the biologic activity of T epitopes, furthermore they suggest that candidate vaccine peptides should be tested for suppressive activity before inclusion in a vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF and macrophage (M)-CSF on Candida albicans growth inhibition by human peripheral blood monocytes was investigated. By using a radiolabel microassay developed in our laboratory that makes use of the incorporation of [3H]glucose into residual C. albicans, we demonstrated that rGM-CSF and rIL-3 effectively enhanced human monocyte-mediated anticandidal activity. Incubation for 24 h with either GM-CSF or IL-3 significantly enhanced monocyte antifungal responses down to 0.01 U/ml. M-CSF, at higher concentrations of 10 U/ml, could also enhance monocyte function but to a smaller degree. None of the CSF interfered directly with fungal growth, even up to 1000 U/ml. Because IFN-gamma is also a known monocyte activator, its effect on monocytes was also assessed. Monocytes were first cultured in medium for several days and then further incubated with each of the cytokines. Monocytes aged in medium were found to lose their spontaneous anticandidal activity. Such aged monocytes did not develop anticandidal activity in response to IFN-gamma but did in response to GM-CSF or IL-3. To further elucidate this difference, fresh monocytes were continuously cultured with or without cytokines for 1 to 5 days before assessing their anticandidal activity. Monocytes cultured in IFN-gamma progressively lost their activity by 2 days but monocytes in GM-CSF or IL-3 maintained their high level of anticandidal activity throughout the whole length of culture. Therefore, GM-CSF and IL-3 not only enhanced fresh monocyte anticandidal activity, but maintained monocyte function for a longer period. These results suggest that GM-CSF and IL-3 may act on monocytes via a different pathway than does IFN-gamma.\r"

Previously, we identified the 17.109-cross-reactive Id in chronic lymphocytic leukemia as a serologic marker for expression of a highly conserved V kappa gene, designated Humkv325. Using sense-strand oligonucleotides specific for the 5'-end of this V kappa gene and antisense oligonucleotide specific for a J kappa region consensus sequence, we could amplify specifically Humkv325 when juxtaposed with J kappa through Ig gene rearrangement. This allowed us to amplify rearranged V kappa genes from DNA isolated from minute amounts of lymphoma biopsy material for molecular analyses. Our studies demonstrate that 17.109-reactive SL NHL, with or without associated CLL, rearrange, and presumably express, Humkv325 without substantial somatic diversification. Our data suggest that malignant B cells in SL NHL, in contrast to NHL of follicular center cell origin, may express immunoglobulin variable region genes with little or no somatic hypermutation.\r"

Before IL-2 administration, we found low level or no evidence of cytokine-mRNA expression in PBMC. After IL-2 infusion, circulating PBMC showed enhanced proliferative activity and contained significant levels of mRNA for TNF-alpha and IL-6 as well as mRNA for the p55 IL-2R, Tac, but no mRNA coding for granulocyte-monocyte-CSF and TNF-beta (lymphotoxin). IL-1 beta mRNA was expressed at very low levels in circulating PBMC after IL-2 infusion. Each of these cytokine -mRNA was, however, inducible in vitro by stimulation of PBMC with IL-2 alone. The results of these in vivo studies suggest that IL-2 may be a physiologic inducer of TNF and IL-6 which, because of their pleiotropic effects, may be important endogenous signals in the body's immune response and account for some of the physiologic changes seen in patients receiving high dose IL-2.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate levels are decreased in erythrocytes from individuals with beta-thalassemia minor. Because 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is an essential precurosr of adenine nucleotides, we tested the hypothesis that impaired PRPP synthesis is a mechanism for the decreased adenine nucleotide content. Erythrocyte PRPP synthetase activity was significantly decreased, and the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) was significantly increased in individuals with alpha-thalassemia minor and those with beta-thalassemia minor. Intact erythrocytes from individuals with alpha-thalassemia and those with beta-thalassemia minor also had an impaired rate of PRPP formation. Both the decrease in PRPP synthetase activity and the impaired PRPP formation were also found in erythrocytes with microcytosis resulting from iron deficiency, indicating that these phenomena may not be specific to thalassemia minor. In all individuals examined, the rate of PRPP formation correlated with ATP content, suggesting that either (1) PRPP synthetase activity is a determinant of ATP content or (2) ATP content is a determinant of PRPP synthetase activity. The depletion of ATP from normal erythrocytes did not affect PRPP synthetase activity, suggesting that ATP content is not a determinant of PRPP synthetase activity. However, a decrease in PRPP synthetase activity did cause an impairment in the rate of adenine nucleotide synthesis, suggesting that PRPP synthetase activity is a determinant of ATP content. Taken together, our results suggest that the decrease in PRPP synthetase activity and the resulting impairment in the rate of PRPP formation are mechanisms for the decreased adenine nucleotide content in thalassemic erythrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Cellophane wrapping of the hamster pancreas induces a trophic stimulus that leads to ductular proliferation in association with nesidioblastosis. Our previous studies have demonstrated that cellophane wrapping of the pancreas leads to the development of a new population of beta-cells that is capable of reversing streptozocin-induced diabetes. The predominant type of islet regenerated is initially small but progressively enlarges to the size of control islets. Electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry revealed areas of nesidioblastosis that contained a predominance of beta-cells, but also alpha- and delta-cells. Metabolic studies were conducted to define the functional aspects of this model. After cellophane wrapping of the normal hamster pancreas, normal serum levels of glucose and insulin were maintained despite a 2.5-fold increase in the number of pancreatic islets per square millimeter compared with a control group that underwent a sham operation and was not wrapped. Islets were harvested from control and cellophane-wrapped pancreata and demonstrated a similar biphasic insulin response to high-dose glucose perfusion in vitro. Insulin secretion ceased with low-dose glucose perfusion. Insulin derived from unwrapped pancreata was found to comprise two peaks on high-pressure liquid chromatography and that from wrapped pancreata a single peak. The biologically active insulin corresponded on high-pressure liquid chromatography with the standard insulin preparation. Thus, the experimental induction of nesidioblastosis is associated with development of normal beta-cell sensitivity to glucose and release of a single form of a biologically active insulin. It thus represents a possible therapeutic approach to diabetes.\r"

One hundred and twenty patients completed the double-blind phase of the trial, which lasted 21 months. The primary analysis was performed according to the \"intention-to-treat principle\" in all 151 enrolled patients. There was, continuing on from the third month after randomization, a progressive and sustained improvement of the pain-free and maximum walking distances in the two treatment groups that was significantly greater in the ticlopidine group. The ankle-arm systolic blood pressure ratio at rest and after exercise increased in a significant manner in the ticlopidine group only. In a secondary analysis, with exclusion of 25 patients because of protocol violations at selection, consistently significant differences in favor of the ticlopidine group were still observed for maximum walking distance and systolic ankle-arm blood pressure ratio, both at rest and after exercise. No major side effects were reported in the treated group. It is concluded that long-term treatment with ticlopidine improves walking ability and ankle systolic blood pressure in patients with claudication.\r"

Measurement of capillary blood glucose with a reflectance meter is well known and considered to be accurate, reliable, less costly, and more convenient than the laboratory test of plasma glucose. One hundred eighty-one pregnant women were tested with both a 1-hour glucose challenge test by capillary blood glucose and a 3-hour glucose tolerance test by venous plasma glucose. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus was made by the standard criteria on the 3-hour glucose tolerance test. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimum threshold value. There were seven cases of gestational diabetes mellitus detected during this study period, producing an incidence of 3.9%. The threshold value for the 1-hour glucose challenge test by capillary blood glucose was 9.0 mmol/L (163 mg/dL); the test has a sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and likelihood ratio of 0.857, 0.868, 0.207, and 6.48, respectively. This test was at least as accurate as a 1-hour glucose challenge test by venous plasma glucose. Given its advantages, such as lower cost, simplicity, better patient acceptance, and immediate availability of the result, capillary blood glucose testing should be considered for screening of gestational diabetes mellitus in the office setting.\r"

Neonatal screening combining thyroxine and thyrotropin screening have resulted in increased detection, although false-negatives do occur, and the physician must carefully observe all newborns for the findings of congenital hypothyroidism. Early treatment improves the prognosis considerably. This paper reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism.\r"

Charts from 2254 patients of these physicians were reviewed. The average age and percentage of board certification of both groups of physicians are similar. Patients of general internists were slightly older than the family practice patients (average age 61 vs 59 years). The general internists saw significantly fewer patients per hour (3.0) than the family physicians (3.6). Family physicians were more likely to employ a registered nurse (33%) than were general internists (17%), and family physicians were twice as likely to delegate patient education to office staff than were the general internists. The mean number and kinds of antihypertensive medications prescribed were similar. Internists did more laboratory testing, but the difference was not statistically significant. General internists were more likely to change medication when their patients' blood pressure was uncontrolled than were family physicians (in 60% vs 40% of patients, P = .02), and they were also more likely to recall uncontrolled patients within 3 months than were family physicians (50% vs 35% of patients, P = .05). There was no significant difference in mean diastolic blood pressure or in hypertension-related behaviors, such as medication adherence, aerobic exercise, alcohol consumption, or amount of dietary salt, between the two patient groups; however, over 35% of patients of both groups had elevated blood pressure readings despite taking medications. Overall, there were more similarities than differences in the care physicians provided. Efforts to change physician performance in the treatment of hypertensive patients are still warranted and equally applicable to both groups.\r"

Certain aquatic insects such as the chironomid midges (Diptera, Chironomidae), and the caddisflies (Trichoptera), are capable of colonizing immersed bodies; and with the known biology of a specific species of insect for a certain geographic area, time intervals of submersion can be established.\r"

It is argued, first, that the traditional paradigms--investigating epidemic and endemic occurrence of illness in the context of public-health activities, inclusive of the deployment of census, vital and morbidity statistics and sample surveys--are misleading for scientific research. Major examples of the consequences of these paradigms are the preoccupations with time and place, and with \"the general population\" or some other \"target population\"--both alien from the vantage of clinical trials and, indeed, of science in general. Then it is shown, by the use of the clinical trial paradigm, that traditional epidemiologic thought and practice in cause-effect research are misguided in the context of such common contexts as the use of empirical contrasts between exposure and unspecified nonexposure, the employment of \"representative\" distributions of determinants, and, even, as to the belief that cohort and \"case-control\" studies constitute alternatives to each other. On the other hand, it is argued that for etiologic research the ordinary (parallel) clinical trial is misleading as a paradigm, especially as for learning about the essential temporal aspects of the cause-effect relation.\r"

Because ethical requirements preclude the use of a placebo or no-treatment control for internal study validation, certain methodologic issues arise in active control equivalence trials that require special attention. We emphasize a special feature of this alternative study design, namely, its reliance on an implicit \"historical control assumption\". To conclude that a new drug is efficacious on the basis of an active control equivalence study (ACES) requires a fundamental assumption that the active control drug would have performed better than a placebo, had a placebo been used in the trial. In designing an ACES, one needs some assurance that historical estimates of the active control drug's efficacy relative to placebo are applicable to the new experimental setting. Steps that can be taken to compile such evidence and to justify the use of an active control equivalence design are described. These issues are illustrated in the context of a planned study to evaluate the efficacy of a new drug for the prevention of stroke, using aspirin as an active control.\r"

Subjects were between 24 and 98 years of age, with a mean age of 63 years. Arterial locations evaluated were: proximal, mid and distal common carotid; the bifurcation; and the proximal and mid internal and external carotids. In a general linear multivariate analysis with plaque thickness at each site as the outcome variable, cigarette smoking and age were the two most consistent risk factors, and affected plaque thickness at all the investigated sites. Hypertension affected more sites than diabetes, men had more plaques than women, and except for the common carotid, whites had more plaques than blacks.

Other aspects of the rating process that affect rater judgments can be classified as one of two types: inconsistencies due to limitations in human judgment, and inconsistencies due to situation-specific variables. When inconsistencies are due to limitations in human judgment, such as framing effects, a reasonable solution is to help the rater to see and correct the inconsistency. When inconsistencies are due to situation-specific variables, such as the way the health state is defined and presented, investigators should attempt to standardize conditions across studies.\r"

Eighteen percent of patients achieved a complete response and 45% a partial response (PR), for an overall response rate of 63%. A variety of pretreatment patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed for both the tumor response to NAC and survival rate. Significantly higher CR rates were found in patients with a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status (PS) of 0 to 1 than in those patients with a PS of 2 (P = .03). Patients with stage III disease were significantly more likely to respond than those with stage IV (P = .006). Evaluation of all parameters through multivariate analysis identifies the tumor classification (P = .001) and the primary site (P = .006) as the most significant in predicting CR. The overall 5-year survival rate of the entire group of patients was 18% (median survival, 14.3 months). Analysis by PS (P = .001), stage (P = .002), and tumor (P = .001), and node (P = .01) classes showed significant differences. Patients achieving a CR after NAC had a significantly improved survival rate as compared with those with residual disease at assessment (P = .0003). With the multistep regression analysis, the tumor (P = .005) and node (P = .007) classifications, and the sex (P = .03) were significant factors, but CR (P = .0004) remained the most important and independent predictive factor. Randomized prospective trials are requested to clearly establish the role of NAC on survival rates.\r"

  ".W": "To increase the complete response (CR) rate of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer after three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we added sequential methotrexate to the combination of cisplatin and continuous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU). We also evaluated the feasibility of administering three additional cycles of the same regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy. Thirty-eight patients were treated; the median age was 53 years and 36 patients had stage IV disease. Chemotherapy consisted of methotrexate 120 mg/m2 followed 24 hours later by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and a five-day continuous infusion of 5-FU at 1,000 mg/m2/d. Of 34 patients evaluable for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, nine had a CR, 21 a partial response (PR), two a minimal response (MR), and one patient each stable disease (SD) and no response (NR). Of 31 patients who received local therapy, 15 were treated with surgery and radiotherapy and 16 with radiotherapy alone. Of 25 patients eligible to receive adjuvant chemotherapy only ten received all three intended cycles, while 15 received less or no adjuvant chemotherapy because of patient refusal, cumulative toxicity, or early disease progression. With a median follow-up time of 39 months, the median survival is estimated to be 20 months. Of eight patients with nasopharyngeal or paranasal sinus cancer, none has had disease recurrence. Patients with good initial performance status and low N-stage also had a significant survival advantage. Chemotherapy-related toxicities consisted mainly of mucositis, requiring 5-FU dose reduction in the majority of patients; similar toxicities were exacerbated in the adjuvant setting. The addition of methotrexate did not increase the CR rate over what has been reported for the combination of cisplatin and 5-FU alone. Certain subsets of patients appear to have a good prognosis when treated in this fashion. The administration of adequate adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer remains difficult due to toxicity and poor patient compliance.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five patients with disseminated cancer (nine with renal cell carcinoma, five with melanoma, three with Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic myelocytic leukemia [CML], two with soft tissue sarcoma, one each with large-cell lymphoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer), 13 males and 12 females, aged 25 to 68, were treated with recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL2) by continuous infusion and adoptive transfer of autologous lymphocytes activated in vitro with IL2. Patients underwent leukapheresis on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the treatment. Cells, bulk activated for 20 hours in serum-free culture medium with 1,000 U IL2/mL in transfusion transfer packs as culture vessels, were transfused the following day. The infusion of IL2 by continuous infusion for six days started immediately after each adoptive transfer for 4 weekly courses. The dose of IL2 was escalated weekly in each patient; starting doses of IL2 were also escalated in subsequent cohorts of patients until maximally tolerated doses were reached. Nine patients had objective tumor regressions (three with renal cell cancer, two with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and one each with melanoma, sarcoma, breast, and colon cancer). Six responses were partial, two were minor, and one was mixed. Responding patients were maintained with IL2 by continuous infusion for six days every 6 to 8 weeks, without adoptive cell transfer. The median duration of responses was 16 weeks (3 to 60 + weeks). Tumor regression was related to the dose of IL2 (greater than or equal to 3.4 x 10(6) U/m2/d for six days) and to the in vivo lymphoproliferative effects of the lymphokine, but not to the total number of cells adoptively transferred. Side effects of treatment were transient and quickly reversible. Renal, hepatic dysfunction, and dyspnea were directly related to the dose of IL2 and to lymphocytosis. Other toxicities were mild hypotension with mild fluid retention, oral mucositis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, and fatigue.\r"

  ".W": "The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and prednisone (CMFP) or CMFP plus tamoxifen (CMFPT) for 1 year compared with observation alone in 265 postmenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer is reported with 74 months median follow-up. Overall relapse-free survival tended to favor CMFPT (P = .08), but no survival differences existed between any treatment group. The addition of tamoxifen to CMFP led to slightly (but not significantly) better relapse-free status in all subgroups analyzed. Subgroup analysis based on stratification variables showed significant benefit from CMFP (+/- T) only in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative patients with respect to disease-free status (P = .0003), but not survival (P = .54). Relapse-free status was actually worse for CMFP-treated patients with ER-positive tumors, but not significantly so (P = .15). By multivariate analysis other significant risk factors for relapse-free status were primary tumor size, number of nodes pathologically involved, and the number of nodes examined. ER status was prognostic only for the observation group with the benefit from chemotherapy on ER-negative patients obliterating this difference in treated patients. Survival was affected by the number of involved nodes, tumor size, presence of tumor necrosis, and patient obesity. Analysis of toxicity showed elevation of liver enzymes during the first year to be more common in the observation group compared with those patients receiving adjuvant treatment and to be associated with early recurrence. Toxicity from adjuvant treatment persisted beyond termination of therapy in 53% of patients, but was usually mild and self-limited. We conclude CMFPT offers relapse-free survival benefit in ER-negative patients, but the value of chemotherapy in ER-positive postmenopausal, node-positive patients must be questioned.\r"

An overall objective response rate of 24% was achieved (95% confidence interval, 13% to 38%), with an additional 56% of patients maintaining stable disease. Eleven of 12 patients who responded had received previous 5-FU therapy. Toxicity of this regimen included grade 3 diarrhea in 13%, grade 3 or 4 mucositis in 33%, grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia in 65%, and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 19%. Delay of treatment was required for hematologic toxicity in 44 patients. Thirty-eight patients required dose reductions due to toxicity. Biochemical evaluation of tumor biopsy specimens obtained from 17 patients used as their own controls with and without leucovorin was performed. These studies reveal an increased stabilization of the 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP)-thymidylate synthase (TS) folate ternary complex with the addition of leucovorin. There was a 71% +/- 14% occupancy or inhibition of the enzyme with the use of both 5-FU and leucovorin, v 30% +/- 13% for 5-FU alone (P2 less than .037). The percent TS bound in responding patients was substantially higher than in those patients with progressive disease. Finally, the mean total tumor TS pre-therapy in seven patients was 31 fmol/mg compared with a mean of 81 fmol/mg in these same seven patients 24 hours after therapy. This 2.6-fold increase suggests that there is an induction of the enzyme, TS, with 5-FU treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen patients with brain metastases from previously untreated small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) were treated with three courses of systemic chemotherapy as an initial mode of treatment. Whole brain irradiation was given concurrently with the fourth course of chemotherapy. The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide, 600 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on day 1; doxorubicin, 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1; vincristine, 1.5 mg IV days 1 and 5; and etoposide, 60 mg/m2 IV days 3 through 5; all repeated every 3 weeks with dosage adjustments. There were ten men and four women, with a median age of 59 years (range, 47 to 75). Six patients had multiple brain lesions, and the brain was the sole site of distant metastasis in four patients. Three patients were inevaluable for response in the brain, as two died early and the third dropped out of the trial too soon. Brain lesions responded to chemotherapy in nine (one complete remission [CR], eight partial remissions [PR]) of 11 (82%) evaluable patients, and objective responses in the extracranial lesions were documented in nine (one CR, eight PR) of 12 (75%) evaluable patients. Median survival was 34 weeks (range, 1 to 93), and two patients are still alive. Toxicity was significant, with severe granulocytopenia (less than 500/microL) and thrombocytopenia (less than 50,000/microL) observed in 85% and 15% of patients, respectively. Six patients had major infectious complications, which resulted in septic deaths in two. However, there was no deterioration of neurologic status during the initial phase of treatment with chemotherapy. We conclude that systemic chemotherapy alone can induce objective regression of metastatic brain lesions in patients with previously untreated SCLC.\r"

Therefore, we assessed the relationship between survival and in vitro tumor cell growth from specimens obtained during routine staging procedures in 68 consecutive patients with untreated, extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who received etoposide/cisplatin chemotherapy. Three groups of SCLC patients could be distinguished: (1) 23 patients in whom a tumor cell line was established in vitro; (2) 28 patients in whom tumor-containing specimens were cultured but in vitro growth did not occur; and (3) 17 patients in whom no tumor-containing specimen could be procured. No significant difference in response rates to chemotherapy of the three groups was noted. Poor performance status (P2 = .001), male gender (P2 = .0008), liver metastases (P2 = .0033), brain metastases (P2 = .0152), and the ability to obtain a tumor-containing specimen from the patient for laboratory culture (P2 = .0005) were all significant independent predictors of decreased survival in this patient population. While the ability to obtain a tumor cell specimen for cell culture using routine staging and diagnostic procedures identified patients with shortened survival, we found no significant survival differences between patients whose tumor cell specimens grew in cell culture v those that did not (median survival of 7 months v 11 months, P2 = .72). Our study indicates that the clinical outcome of extensive-stage SCLC patients from whom tumor cell lines can be established is not significantly different than in those cases from whom tumor-containing specimens could not be grown in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "89293186\r", 
  ".W": "Between September 1986 and March 1988, 33 patients with refractory germ cell cancer were entered on a phase I/II trial of two courses of high-dose carboplatin plus etoposide with autologous bone marrow support. All patients had extensive prior treatment and had either cisplatin-refractory disease (67%) defined as progression within 4 weeks of the last cisplatin dose or failed at least two cisplatin-based regimens (35%) including a cisplatin-ifosfamide salvage regimen. Patients received a fixed total dose of etoposide of 1,200 mg/m2 with each cycle. The carboplatin dose ranged from 900 mg/m2 to 2,000 mg/m2. Twenty of the 33 patients received the second cycle of therapy. Despite extensive prior therapy with cisplatin, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, or hearing impairment with high-dose carboplatin and etoposide was unusual. The most common nonhematologic toxicity was moderate enterocolitis. The hematologic toxicity of this regimen was substantial at each dose level. All 53 courses were accompanied by granulocytopenic fevers. Seven of the 33 patients (21%) died from treatment. All of these deaths occurred during the granulocyte nadir, and five were related to documented sepsis. Overall, 14 of 32 patients (44%) evaluable for response obtained an objective response, including eight complete remissions. Four patients remain in complete remission, with three patients being continuously free of disease in excess of 1 year. Eight responders (including four complete remissions) had progressed while receiving cisplatin. We conclude that carboplatin and etoposide can be administered in combination at high dosages and this regimen may have curative potential for patients with germ cell tumors resistant to conventional-dose cisplatin-based therapies.\r"

Patients accrued in 1980 and 1981 were to receive 6020 rads of whole-brain radiotherapy concurrent with the first course of chemotherapy. Patients accrued in 1982 and 1983 were randomly assigned to receive either whole-brain irradiation as above, or 4300 rads of whole-brain radiotherapy plus 1720 rads coned down to to the tumor volume. The data were analyzed for the total randomized population and separately for the 510 patients, termed the \"Valid Study Group (VSG),\" who met protocol eligibility specifications (including central pathology review), 80% of whom had glioblastoma multiforme. The median survival times from time of randomization for the three chemotherapy groups of the VSG ranged from 11.3 to 13.8 months, and 29% to 37% of the patients survived for 18 months (life-table estimate); the differences between these groups were not statistically significant. Survival differences between the radiotherapy groups were small and not statistically significant. It is concluded that, for malignant glioma, giving part of the radiotherapy by coned-down boost is as effective as full whole-brain irradiation, and that multiple-drug chemotherapy as outlined in this protocol conferred no significant survival advantage over BCNU alone.\r"

During a subsequent transvenous approach to the cavernous sinus through the jugular vein, the inferior petrosal sinus was perforated. A minor subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred before the tear could be sealed by the deposition of three Gianturco coils in the vein. The patient was taken to the operating room for emergency obliteration of the fistula and petrosal sinus in order to remove the risk of further hemorrhage. Under the guidance of intraoperative digital subtraction angiography, isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate was injected directly into the surgically exposed cavernous sinus. Successful obliteration of the fistula was achieved with preservation of the carotid artery, and the angiography catheter was removed safely from the petrosal sinus. Although initially after surgery the patient had nearly complete ophthalmoplegia, at her 1-year follow-up examination she had normal ocular motility and visual acuity. The transvenous approach to the cavernous sinus and alternative methods of treatment of carotid-cavernous fistulas are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical usefulness of intraoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring of cerebral perfusion during aneurysm surgery has received little attention, primarily due to problems with electrode placement over the operative site, which is the area of maximal risk. In this report, 27 patients undergoing surgery for anterior circulation aneurysms were monitored intraoperatively with a two-channel computerized EEG complex using a bilateral frontal-occipital montage. In 16 patients, a normal EEG pattern was observed throughout surgery; all 16 awoke neurologically intact and their postoperative angiograms did not reveal cerebral vasospasm. In the other 11 patients, one of two patterns of persistent EEG abnormalities was identified. 1) In six of these patients a marked attenuation of EEG activity was observed ipsilaterally which coincided with various intraoperative events including brain retraction, hypotension, and aneurysm dissection/clipping. Five of these six patients awoke with new neurological deficits which persisted beyond 12 hours in two, both of whom had angiographically proven vasospasm 24 hours after surgery. 2) In the remaining five patients, a distinct abnormal EEG pattern consisting of marked hyperactivity in the delta, theta, and alpha frequency ranges was observed ipsilaterally. Four of these five patients had a poor neurological outcome and vasospasm on their angiogram 24 hours after surgery. Thus, EEG monitoring which spans the operative area during aneurysm surgery is practicable and appears to be of value in the detection of compromised cerebral perfusion during aneurysm surgery. The possible significance of the two abnormal EEG patterns identified in this report is discussed.\r"

Previously reported cases of radiation-induced glioma are reviewed and analyzed for common characteristics. Children receiving central nervous system irradiation appear particularly susceptible to induction of malignant gliomas by radiation. Interstitial brachytherapy may be used successfully instead of external beam radiotherapy in previously irradiated, tumor-free brain, and thus may reduce the risk of radiation necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to use a new 21-aminosteroid (U-74006F) with in vitro antioxidant and antilipolytic properties as a pharmacological probe to assess the role of lipid hydrolysis and peroxidation in a rabbit model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced vasospasm. Cerebral angiograms were performed on 15 rabbits. Eighteen hours later, 1 cc/kg of autologous blood was infused into the cisterna magna of all 15 animals. Six rabbits received no treatment, six received U-74006F starting 30 minutes after SAH, and three rabbits received the vehicle for U-74006F starting 30 minutes after SAH. At 72 hours post-SAH, a second angiogram was obtained. Digital subtraction angiographic techniques were used to measure the diameter of and contrast material flow through the basilar artery. At 72 hours post-SAH, vasospasm was evident in all untreated and vehicle-treated rabbits. The diameter of and the flow through the basilar artery were significantly reduced 42.3% +/- 6.6% and 46.8% +/- 5.8%, respectively, below pre-SAH levels (means +/- standard error of the means). Treatment with U-74006F eliminated the SAH-induced vasospasm; in treated animals, both the flow through and the diameter of the basilar arteries were at pre-SAH levels. These findings indicate that: 1) membrane lipid changes (that is, hydrolysis with eicosanoid production and/or peroxidation) contribute to the chronic vasospasm resulting from SAH, and 2) U-74006F prevents the SAH-induced chronic vasospasm in this model by limiting these pathological membrane events.\r"

On imaging with ultrasound, they can also be readily confused with hepatoma, metastatic disease, or focal nodular hyperplasia. Nine giant hemangiomas (maximal diameter greater than 8 cm) were studied by scintigraphy and ultrasound. In all instances, the fill-in of the lesion on [99mTc]RBC scintigraphy indicated the diagnosis of hemangioma, adding specificity to the screening sonographic study. The pattern of fill-in on scintigraphy also appeared to be size dependent with lesions less than 11 cm in diameter equilibrating uniformly, while larger abnormalities intensified in centripetal fashion.\r"

  ".W": "The biodistribution, dosimetry, and safety of a new myocardial imaging agent, 99mTc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (HEXAMIBI), was evaluated in 17 normal volunteers at rest and exercise (Phase I studies). Technetium-99m HEXAMIBI clears rapidly from the blood with good myocardial uptake and favorable myocardial-to-background ratios for myocardial imaging. Dosimetry allows for administration of up to 30 mCi (1, 110 Bq) of [99mTc]HEXAMIBI. The myocardial images were of good quality and appeared less granular with sharper myocardial walls compared to 201T1 images. The clinical efficacy of [99mTc]HEXAMIBI planar stress and rest imaging was evaluated in a multicenter Phase II clinical trial involving 38 patients. Of 36 patients with significant coronary artery disease, 35 patients (97%) had abnormal 201T1 stress images, and 32 (89%) had abnormal [99mTc]HEXAMIBI stress images (P = N.S.). Technetium-99m HEXAMIBI images correlated in 31/35 patients (86%) who had either scar or ischemia on 201T1 images. By segmental myocardial analysis, exact concordance was obtained in 463/570 myocardial segments (81%). This multicenter Phase I and II study indicates that planar [99mTc]HEXAMIBI stress imaging is safe and compares well with 201T1 stress imaging for detection of coronary artery disease.\r"

Thirty-four patients and 11 clinically normal volunteers were studied prospectively to see if specificity of inferior wall defects for right coronary artery disease could be improved by scanning patients prone versus supine. All individuals were scanned both prone and supine, in random order, following symptom limited treadmill exercise. Images were acquired at 3 degrees steps, 25 sec per frame, in a 180 degrees elliptical orbit always beginning in the 45 degrees right anterior oblique position relative to the patient. Polar maps generated from the short axis slices were used to calculate the average regional activity. The prone studies showed consistently higher inferior wall activity compared to the supine studies on both the exercise (182 +/- 22 vs. 160 +/- 23, p less than or equal to 0.001) and 4-hr delay studies (183 +/- 20 vs. 175 +/- 21, p less than or equal to 0.001). Prone imaging resulted in a significantly higher specificity for RCA disease compared to supine imaging (90% vs. 66%, p less than 0.05) with an improvement in accuracy from 71% to 82%. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for left anterior descending and left circumflex artery disease were not significantly affected by patient position during imaging. All patients having SPECT thallium myocardial perfusion studies should be imaged prone to minimize artifactual inferior wall defects and improve accuracy.\r"

We evaluated the biodistribution, dosimetry and scintigraphic pattern of [99mTc]ECD in normal subjects and the accuracy of SPECT imaging in patients with chronic cerebral infarction. Sixteen normal subjects were injected with approximately 10 mCi of [99mTc]ECD. Anterior and posterior single-pass whole-body images were obtained at multiple times after injection. Blood clearance of the radiotracer was rapid, falling to 10.0 +/- 6.6% and 4.9 +/- 1.1% of the injected dose at 2 and 60 min, respectively. Brain uptake was 6.4 +/- 2.1% of the injected dose 5 min after injection. The critical organ was the urinary bladder. Technetium-99m ECD SPECT was performed with a rotating gamma camera in ten of the 16 normal subjects and 34 patients with clinical and CT evidence of chronic stroke. Thirty-three of the thirty-four patients had focal [99mTc]ECD abnormalities on SPECT (97.1%) based on visual inspection of the SPECT images. In summary, we obtained high quality SPECT images as a result of the optimal physical and biologic characteristics of the tracer. Technetium-99m ECD SPECT shows promise for the evaluation of patients with stroke.\r"

Radionuclide ventricular function studies provide a reliable, reproducible means to quantify global left ventricular systolic performance, a critical determinant of prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease. In addition, the ability to evaluate regional left ventricular wall motion and to assess ventricular performance during exercise have secured a fundamental role for such studies in the screening and treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Radionuclide techniques have been extended to the evaluation of left ventricular relaxation/filling events, left ventricular systolic/diastolic function in the ambulatory setting, and with appropriate technical modifications, to the assessment of right ventricular performance at rest and with exercise. As a complement to radionuclide perfusion studies, cardiac blood-pool imaging allows for thorough noninvasive description of cardiac physiology and function in both normal subjects and in patients with a broad range of cardiovascular diseases.\r"

Thallium-201 imaging was performed immediately postexercise, immediately after eating/H2O and 210 min after eating/H2O. Between initial and immediate post eating/H2O images 201Tl reversible defects occurred in 27/38 regions in the H2O test versus 15/38 regions in the eating test (p = 0.02). Over this early time period, plasma 201Tl activity was significantly higher in the H2O test than eating test (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, early reversal of 201Tl defects may, in part, be the result of higher plasma 201Tl activity early after initial postexercise 201Tl imaging.\r"

In this study, cardiac imaging with [123I]MIBG was performed in patients with idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy and compared to normal controls. Initial uptake, half-time of tracer within the heart, and heart to lung ratios were all significantly reduced in patients compared to normals. Uptake in lungs, liver, salivary glands, and spleen was similar in controls and patients with cardiomyopathy indicating that decreased MIBG uptake was not a generalized abnormality in these patients. Iodine-123 MIBG imaging was also performed in cardiac transplant patients to determine cardiac nonneuronal uptake. Uptake in transplants was less than 10% of normals in the first 2 hr and nearly undetectable after 16 hr. The decreased uptake of MIBG suggests cardiac sympathetic nerve dysfunction while the rapid washout of MIBG from the heart suggests increased cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of metoclopramide on gastroesophageal reflux was studied in 30 infants less than 1 year of age. Gastroesophageal reflux was documented in all infants by extended pH monitoring before enrollment in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive metoclopramide 0.1 mg/kg or placebo four times a day, 1/2 hour before feeding for 1 week, followed by the alternate regimen for 1 week. The infants were reevaluated with extended pH monitoring and scintigraphy after 4 to 7 days of each treatment. A symptom score was derived by determining the average number of occurrences of all symptoms recorded daily by parents on a symptom checklist during pretreatment, placebo, and metoclopramide treatment periods. There was a difference between pretreatment evaluation and placebo periods with respect to daily symptom scores (p less than 0.005), reflecting a significant placebo response. However, no difference in scintigraphic study was found between placebo and metoclopramide periods. A significant difference between placebo and metoclopramide periods was noted in the percentage of time esophageal pH was less than 4.0 (p less than 0.001). However, although metoclopramide decreased the proportion of time esophageal pH was less than 4.0, pH remained less than 4.0 for more than 5% of the time in most patients. Substratification of the total group into infants younger and older than 3 months revealed that older infants had greater average daily weight gain during the metoclopramide treatment period (34.3 gm/day) than in the placebo treatment period (6.6 gm/day, p = 0.05). We conclude that metoclopramide in the dosage 0.1 mg/kg four times daily reduces reflux in infants and may be useful for infants with poor weight gain and other serious complications of gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

The MBDL regimen was more effective than chlorpromazine in both objective and subjective measures of antiemetic control. Of 26 children, 23 (89%) had less vomiting on the MBDL regimen, and 20 (77%) of 26 patients or parents preferred this regimen (p less than 0.01). The MBDL regimen reduced the number of vomiting episodes by a mean of 4.0 (p less than 0.01) and reduced the duration of vomiting by a mean of 3.7 hours (p less than 0.01). A moderate level of sedation was documented at some stage in the 24-hour period of observation in 27% on the MBDL regimen and in 35% receiving chlorpromazine. Dystonia was seen in 1 (4%) of 26 children. We conclude that the MBDL regimen is safe in children and more effective than chlorpromazine.\r"

One strain from each patient was included in the study. Eighty-four of the patients were infected with Escherichia coli, which was assigned a clonotype according to the O:K:H stereotype; 55 patients carried one of the 12 multiply occurring clones. Globotetraosylceramide-specific (globo+) adhesion was present in 90% of these 12 clones, compared with 62% in the remaining 29 singly occurring clones. The patients infected with globo+ strains had significantly increased inflammatory reactions compared with patients with globo- strains. The O1:K1:H7 strain was the single most frequent clone (n = 14) that always expressed globo+ adhesins. Patients infected with O1:K1:H7 had an inflammatory response similar to that of other globo+ infections, but had a shorter duration of symptoms before diagnosis, higher fever, and higher peripheral leukocyte count. These results demonstrate special virulence of the O1:K1:H7 clone, reflected by the acuteness of onset of infection.\r"

Five patients were identified whose management was complicated by the presence of the neoplastic process within vaginal cuff inclusion cysts (or sinuses). All five patients ultimately underwent upper vaginectomy as part of their treatment, and two of them were found to have an invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina. Women who are found to have an abnormal Papanicolaou smear or VAIN in the upper vagina following hysterectomy should be examined carefully for vaginal cuff abnormalities. Those with nodularity or distortion of the cuff are best managed with surgical excision for both treatment of VAIN and discovery of an occult invasive cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The effect on a range of biologic responses of interferon-beta serine (IFN-beta ser), administered by either the sc or the iv route, was examined in 16 patients. Despite the absence of IFN in the serum of 13 of 16 patients after sc administration, biologic changes associated with IFN administration occurred. Significant increases in peripheral mononuclear cell surface proteins were evident. Monocyte human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) showed a 23% increase in mean fluorescent intensity (P = .04) and a 9% increase in percentage of positive cells (P = .02); lymphocyte OKT10 had an 11% increase in percentage of positive cells (P less than .0001) and a 26% increase in mean fluorescent intensity (P = .002). Natural killer cell activity against the Change target increased by 125% (P = .004). Intracellular activity of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase increased 297% at 24 hours and 226% at 48 hours (P less than .0001). Significant increases in serum concentrations of beta 2 microglobulin (24% at 24 hr and 27% at 48 hr, P less than .0001) and neopterin (85%, P = .0001 and 165%, P = .00001) were observed. These alterations after sc administration were similar quantitatively to those resulting from the same dose of IFN-beta ser given iv. Thus, serum IFN concentrations did not have to be measurable for IFN-beta ser to exert biologic activity. The different effects of two dose levels, 45 X 10(6) IU and 180 X 10(6) IU, also were compared independent of route. The higher dose resulted in greater increases over baseline of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity (344% vs. 145% at 24 hr; 231% vs. 83% at 48 hr) and serum neopterin concentrations (185% vs. 99% at 24 hr; 271% vs. 153% at 48 hr). For all the other parameters, there was no significant difference between the two doses.\r"

Age was associated with an increase in serum glucose during both \"ebb\" and \"flow\" phases of the injury response, but not with serum insulin. Serum glucose also increased with the degree of injury as reflected in Glasgow Coma Scale on admission and Injury Severity Score subsequently. Serum cortisol responses were increased in older patients and tended to decrease with time following injury. A more detailed knowledge of how age may alter the ability of elderly patients to respond to trauma and critical illness is essential to allow the continued development of rational therapies for such patients.\r"

The test was considered grossly positive if 10 cc of blood were aspirated from the catheter immediately after its insertion into the peritoneal cavity. Microscopic criteria for positivity included more than 100,000 RBC or 500 WBC/cc of lavage return, elevated amylase or bilirubin, or the presence of vegetable fibers or bacteria. Seventy-two (18%) of the patients were true positives and 315 (80%) were true negatives. There were four false positives (1.3%) and one false negative (0.2%), giving the test a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 98%. Complications occurred in three patients, for a rate of 0.8%, and included catheter insertion into a large ovarian dermoid cyst, needle perforation of the ileum, and needle perforation of the sigmoid colon. This technique of DPL can consistently be performed much more rapidly than the open method. Therefore we conclude that percutaneous DPL is as accurate as, as safe as, and quicker than open DPL for determining intra-abdominal injury in blunt trauma patients.\r"

This randomized, double-blind study compared 0.9% normal saline (NS) to 1.8% hypertonic saline (HS) in 20 postoperative coronary artery bypass patients suffering uniform injury. Study solutions were administered to maintain physiologic endpoints: heart rate, blood pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The groups were similar with respect to age, body surface area, operative procedure, intraoperative fluid status, and intraoperative and postoperative red cell transfusion requirements. HS patients required 30% less fluid than NS patients and were in negative fluid balance during the study (-1,715 +/- 732 ml/24 hr, HS, vs. +266 +/- 825 ml/24 hr, NS; p less than 0.01). In contrast, NS patients were in positive fluid balance after 8 hours. Moreover, HS patients experienced less chest tube drainage than NS patients (981 +/- 88 ml, HS, vs. 1,700 +/- 285 ml, NS; p less than 0.01). Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic measurements, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and shunt fraction did not differ between the two groups. Serum sodium and osmolality increased in the HS group and peaked at 12 hours (145.4 +/- 1.4 mEq/L and 308.7 +/- 2.0 mOsm/kg, respectively) and correlated with the volume of HS infused (correlation coefficient = 0.81). No deaths occurred and no complication was attributed the hypertonicity of the solution. We conclude that 1.8% hypertonic saline is a safe alternative to isotonic crystalloid therapy in the fluid management of postoperative patients. Decreased third-space losses may occur with HS as suggested by the lower thoracic losses in the HS group; 1.8% NaCl may be the preferred solution in situations where excess free water administration is not desired, and where interstitial edema is detrimental to function and/or survival.\r"

The percentage of phagocytosing PMNLs was increased at admission (within 24 hours after injury) and through the first 10 days of hospitalization. The surface binding capacity and the ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus by each PMNL was increased during the same time period, and at day 2 the number of S. aureus ingested per patient PMNL was 35% higher than in the controls. The intracellular killing of Candida albicans was reduced by about 25% at admission. The microbicidal capacity was further compromised during the first 2 weeks after injury, with a reduction of intracellular killing of about 35% 5-10 days after admission. The kinetics of patient PMNL phagolysosomal acidification was altered during the first 20 days, as the initial alkalinization of the phagolysosomes documented in control PMNLs could not be demonstrated in PMNLs from patients with burns. In addition, measurements of maximal phagolysosomal acidification showed a lower pH in patient phagolysosomes than in the controls during the first 5 days. The patient PMNL H2O2 production was reduced at admission and through the first 10 days, with an oxidative burst that was 46% lower than the controls at day 5. The intracellular degradation of S. aureus proteins and DNA was slightly but significantly reduced at day 5 and day 10 after admission. The impairment of PMNL microbicidal capacity correlated with total body surface area burn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Retrospectively, the patients fell into three groups. Group One consisted of five patients with a cardiac rhythm but no recordable blood pressure (BP). Group Two were six patients with refractory hypotension, that is, BP of 80 torr systolic or less. Group Three comprised ten patients who had hemodynamic deterioration to a BP of 80 torr systolic or less during preparation for or in the course of celiotomy. IABO was successful in occluding the thoracic aorta in 20 patients with a resultant rise of BP; one patient required thoracotomy for aortic clamping. Operative control of hemorrhage was accomplished in 11 patients; seven patients survived and were discharged in a functional status. There were no survivors in Group One, three in Group Two, and four in Group Three.\r"

The spread of chloroquine resistance has been documented by sporadic case reports and by isolated population surveys, which do not always completely reflect the risk of infection for travelers using chloroquine prophylaxis. Surveillance of Peace Corps volunteers in West Africa indicates that as of January 1, 1989, P falciparum malaria resistant to chloroquine prophylaxis had spread as far west as Liberia, with only limited risk in Sierra Leone and to the north and west of Sierra Leone. Monitoring the incidence of malaria in highly exposed expatriates provides early warning of the emergence of drug-resistant P falciparum malaria and can provide data to guide recommendations for travelers.\r"

In the first year of surveillance, 93 cases were reported, yielding an annual incidence of 2.1 cases per 100,000 population. The median age of case patients was 14 years (range, 11 months to 78 years), with the highest attack rate among children younger than 5 years (6.1 cases per 100,000 population per year). Bloody diarrhea was present in 95% of reported cases, 12% of patients developed either hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and one patient died. Suspected secondary cases were seen in 5% of households. Fifty-six (60%) cases occurred during June through September, as did 73% of the cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Cases reported during the summer months were more likely than cases reported at other times of the year to be in children younger than 10 years. Medications, including antimicrobial medications, did not influence the duration of symptoms, nor did they appear to alter the risk of developing hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. This newly established surveillance system in Washington demonstrates that E coli O157:H7 is an important and common cause of bloody diarrhea in the United States.\r"

The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 500,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related causes, more than 98% of these deaths occurring in the developing world. Maternal mortality rates in developing countries are as much as 100 times higher than those seen in industrialized countries. The most common causes include obstructed labor and ruptured uterus, postpartum hemorrhage, eclampsia, postpartum infection, and complications of illegal abortion. It is suggested that no new or costly technologies are needed; rather that appropriate priority-setting and allocation of needed resources are essential to the solution of the problem. There are few interventions that hold much hope of success at the village level, although antibiotics, ergonovine maleate, and sedatives might be usefully utilized, after appropriate training. Overall, however, networks of maternity care facilities, trained personnel, and means of transport are necessary to provide needed emergency maternity care services.\r"

The hazards associated with exposure to ultraviolet radiation are of concern to the medical profession. Depending on the amount and form of the radiation, as well as on the skin type of the individual exposed, ultraviolet radiation causes erythema, sunburn, photodamage (photoaging), photocarcinogenesis, damage to the eyes, alteration of the immune system of the skin, and chemical hypersensitivity. Skin cancers most commonly produced by ultraviolet radiation are basal and squamous cell carcinomas. There also is much circumstantial evidence that the increase in the incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma during the past half century is related to increased sun exposure, but this has not been proved. Effective and cosmetically acceptable sunscreen preparations have been developed that can do much to prevent or reduce most harmful effects to ultraviolet radiation if they are applied properly and consistently. Other safety measures include (1) minimizing exposure to ultraviolet radiation, (2) being aware of reflective surfaces while in the sun, (3) wearing protective clothing, (4) avoiding use of artificial tanning devices, and (5) protecting infants and children.\r"

The incidence of preterm birth among women with and without anemia at each week during the third trimester was compared. Early in the third trimester, there was a weak association between anemia and preterm delivery. However, anemia early in the third trimester did not account for the substantial increase in preterm birth seen among black women. Anemia after 30 weeks' gestation was not associated with preterm birth. Among women delivering term infants weighing 2500 g or more, the mean hematocrit rose 0.029 among black women and 0.021 among white women from 25 weeks to term. Compared with hematocrits at 40 weeks' gestation, the odds ratios for anemia reached a maximum at 28 weeks and fell sharply as term approached. When the hematocrits of women in term labor were compared with those of women in preterm labor, a spurious dose-response effect for anemia was created. We conclude that anemia is not a strong factor in the pathogenesis of preterm birth and that comparison of hematocrits from women who are in preterm and term labor produces biased results.\r"

We chose the heterotopic technique because it is simple, does not require cardiopulmonary bypass or heparin, allows for significant size disparity between the recipient and donor hearts, and allows for experimental comparisons between the two hearts. Small newborn piglet hearts are harvested, prepared, and then transplanted into the left chest of larger weanling pigs to augment or substitute for the native left ventricle. Preliminary data from transplants into 49 pigs suggest that the technique is technically possible, the pigs can be immunosuppressed over the long term, and the donor heart can contribute hemodynamically. Experimentally, the model is well designed for the investigation of issues critical for the long-term success of heart transplantation in infants and children, including growth and development, optimal long-term immunosuppression, differences in immunotolerance, and the study of coronary obliterative disease. Clinically, the model has potential applicability in congenital heart anomalies if one native functioning atrium and ventricle are present.\r"

Gallbladder contraction stimulated by ingestion of a liquid test meal was completely abolished by oral administration of loxiglumide 30 min before the test meal. Gastric emptying of radio-opaque markers ingested with the test meal was significantly accelerated by loxiglumide (area under the curve [markers x h] 33.3 [SEM 3.8] vs 17.9 [2.7] after placebo). No effect of loxiglumide was found on small-bowel transit time, but 7 days' treatment with oral loxiglumide (800 mg three times daily) significantly shortened colonic transit time (29.4 [4.1] h after placebo, 15.0 [3.4] h after loxiglumide). It is concluded that CCK is an important mediator of meal-induced gallbladder contraction and is involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility in man.\r"

A prospective, controlled trial of 427 primiparae compared the outcome of labour in women randomly allocated to squatting (218) or conventional semirecumbent (209) management. The squatting group had significantly fewer forceps deliveries (9% vs 16%) and significantly shorter second stages (median length of pushing 31 vs 45 min) than the semirecumbent group. There were fewer perineal tears, but more labial tears, in the squatting group. Apgar scores, blood loss, and post-partum vulvar oedema were similar in both groups. 82% of the women in the squatting group maintained upright positions for most of the second stage, and reported great satisfaction with the supported squatting position. The traditional birth posture of squatting can be easily adapted for modern labour management and has advantages for women in their first labour.\r"

In 61 (11.4%) ultrasonography revealed the characteristic picture associated with bacterial enteritis of the ileocaecal region--enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and mural thickening of the terminal ileum and caecum--but no image of the appendix. In 41 of these a bacterial infection was confirmed: infection due to Yersinia enterocolitica in 21, Campylobacter jejuni in 15, Salmonella B in 3, Salmonella C in 1, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis in 1. In the other 20 bacteriological tests were negative (10) or not done (10). Oral barium studies, done in 15 patients, showed thickening of the terminal ileum in all of them. Only 22 of the 61 patients had diarrhoea. Yersinia enteritis clinically simulated an appendiceal mass in 17 of 22 patients, 6 of the 61 patients underwent surgery, and in all of them the appendix removed was normal. The other 55 patients recovered with conservative treatment. In 26 a planned appendicectomy was cancelled because of the sonographic findings. Bacterial enteritis limited to the ileocaecal region (bacterial ileocaecitis) seems to be responsible for an appreciable number of unnecessary appendicetomies. It has characteristic sonographic features that distinguish it from appendicitis.\r"

An increase in the plasma glucose concentration above 7 mmol/l was associated with a dose-dependent delay in the absorption of glipizide; at a concentration above 11 mmol/l, the plasma glipizide concentration was reduced by 50%. The data indicate that hyperglycaemia may delay the absorption of sulphonylurea agents, probably because it impairs gastric motility and/or gastric emptying. This delay of absorption may be clinically relevant, since the efficacy of short-acting sulphonylureas is dependent upon the absorption rate of the drug.\r"

The last two groups were double-blinded. Bacterial pathogens, mainly Haemophilus influenzae (of which 20% were beta-lactamase producers) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were isolated from 60% of the ear exudates and all isolates were sensitive to augmentin. Most of the infants improved clinically within 3-6 days irrespective of the treatment protocol. As judged by otoscopy, 60% of the patients receiving augmentin, with or without myringotomy, recovered completely compared with 23% of patients treated with myringotomy plus placebo. Treatment with augmentin was also more effective than myringotomy with regard to persistence of ear infection. In the myringotomy plus augmentin group closure of the incision and resolution of the discharge from the incision site was faster than in the myringotomy plus placebo group. The addition of myringotomy to augmentin did not seem to affect either the persistence of the infection after treatment or the residual middle ear effusion.\r"

  ".W": "With over 143,000 cases of AIDS reported to the World Health Organization from 145 countries and with an estimated 5 to 10 million people worldwide infected with HIV, AIDS has become firmly established as a global pandemic. In the region of the Americas over 100,862 cases of AIDS have been reported with indigenous transmission documented in 45 to 46 countries. While North America has the highest annual number of AIDS cases per population, with 72 cases/million, the Caribbean subregion has a disproportionately high number of cases, with annual rates as high as 200 to 300 cases/million population for some countries. Despite differences in absolute number of cases, there has been a remarkable similarity in the temporal rate of increase of AIDS in the countries of the Americas, reflecting delayed introduction of the virus to some areas with an early exponential increase similar to that observed initially in the United States. Although the modes of transmission of HIV are the same throughout the region, evidence of increasing bisexual and heterosexual transmission, particularly in the Caribbean subregion, has resulted in a lower male-to-female ratio of AIDS cases and increased perinatal transmission. Clinically, a resurgence of diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, and tuberculosis has been documented in association with HIV infection in many tropical countries of the Americas. With relatively high rates of HTLV-I infection already established in the Caribbean subregion, the overall public health problems of the Americas will be markedly potentiated by further spread of these 2 human retroviruses. If HIV infection continues to penetrate the poor and less advantaged populations in Latin America and the Caribbean, the potential exists for a massive epidemic in the Americas that may rapidly parallel the situation in Africa.\r"

Significant risk factors in this predominantly male population included chronic cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes, malignancy, and alcoholism. Bacteremia occurred in 74% of cases seen in our series. Nosocomial acquisition of infection was observed in 26%, and infection was frequently polymicrobial in nature with gram-negative enteric bacilli isolated most commonly along with group C streptococci. We observed a broad spectrum of infections including puerperal sepsis, pleuropulmonary infections, skin and soft-tissue infection, central nervous system infection, endocarditis, urinary tract infection, and pharyngeal infections. Several cases of bacteremia of unknown source were observed in neutropenic patients with underlying leukemia. New syndromes of infection due to group C streptococci observed in our series included intra-abdominal abscess, epidural abscess, and dialysis-associated infection. Response to therapy and outcome was related to the underlying disease. While the literature suggests that patients with group C endocarditis respond better to synergistic penicillin-aminoglycoside regimens, patient numbers are too small to draw definite conclusions. The clinical significance of antibiotic tolerant group C streptococci remains uncertain. In patients with serious group C infections including endocarditis, meningitis, septic arthritis, or bacteremia in neutropenic hosts, we advocate the initial use of cell-wall-acting agents in combination with an aminoglycoside.\r"

The disease affects primarily young women in late pregnancy or in the postpartum period but also has been described in postmenopausal women and in one man. It presents as an expanding intrasellar mass or as partial or panhypopituitarism. The etiology may be autoimmune. The natural history of this entity begins with enlargement of the pituitary secondary to inflammatory infiltration and progresses to atrophy of the gland with destruction of pituitary tissue and replacement with fibrosis. At least 1 patient had documented recovery of pituitary function, and the overall potential incidence of recoverable function is unknown. Our improved understanding of this disease has led us to conclude that surgical intervention is not always necessary.\r"

Deregulated c-myc transcription probably contributes to the transformed phenotype of the tumour cells, whereas repression of the normal allele probably reflects the normal turn-off of c-myc in non-dividing plasma cells. We previously identified a plasmacytoma-specific protein which binds to the c-myc promoter region 290 base pairs 5' of the P1 transcription start site. This plasmacytoma repressor factor (myc-PRF; formerly myc-PCF) is not found in cell lines representing earlier B-cell stages during which c-myc is transcribed, so it could be a negative regulator of c-myc transcription in terminally differentiated B cells. Here we report that site-directed deletion of the binding site for this protein leads to a 30-fold increase in transcription of a stably transfected c-myc fusion construct in plasmacytoma cells but has no effect in L cells or 18-81 pre-B cells, which lack the protein. Myc-PRF interacts with another widely distributed protein, myc-CF1 (common factor 1), which binds nearby, and this association may be important in myc-PRF repression.\r"

To facilitate further study of that function, we have created conditional alleles of myc by fusing the hormone-binding domain of the human oestrogen receptor gene to the 5' or the 3' end of human myc. The two chimaeric genes, designated mycer and ermyc, encode proteins that bind oestrogen with high affinity. Expression of one of the genes, mycer, transforms a rat fibroblast cell line in a tightly oestrogen-dependent manner. Transformation is dependent on the presence of a functional myc gene in the chimaera and is reversible upon removal of the hormone. The chimaeric genes will be useful tools to study the mechanisms by which Myc affects cellular phenotype. Recently, chimaeras between the adenovirus E1A protein and the hormone binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor were shown to activate transcription in a manner characteristic for E1A, but in a hormone regulated manner. We therefore asked whether the same strategy could be applied to the product of myc.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have indicated that a family of structurally related proteins with distinct but overlapping tissue distributions are responsible for facilitative glucose transport in mammalian tissues. Insulin primarily stimulates glucose transport by inducing the redistribution of a unique glucose transporter protein from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. This 509-amino-acid integral membrane protein, termed GLUT-4, is the main insulin-responsive glucose transporter in adipose and muscle tissues. We have observed a dramatic decrease (tenfold) in the steady-state levels of GLUT-4 messenger RNA in adipose tissue from fasted rats or rats made insulin deficient with streptozotocin. Insulin treatment of the streptozotocin-diabetic rats or refeeding the fasted animals causes a rapid recovery of the GLUT-4 mRNA to levels significantly above those observed in untreated control animals. By contrast, the levels of the erythrocyte/HepG2/rat brain-type glucose transporter mRNA remain essentially unchanged under these conditions. These data suggest that the in vivo expression of GLUT-4 mRNA in rat adipose tissue is regulated by insulin.\r"

This classification is used to document the extent and anatomic distribution of PVR present preoperatively and to help standardize the surgical treatment. Experience has shown that this classification facilitates the identification of these membranes and their systematic dissection, and the authors therefore suggest that it be used to augment the Retina Society classification of PVR.\r"

Complications, including reoperations, as measured by the \"score\" system, were similar. The anatomic results of the two operations were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05), but pneumatic retinopexy had less morbidity and better postoperative visual acuity (P = 0.01).

All patients had large hemorrhagic choroidal detachments with five eyes showing \"kissing\" detachments. Secondary surgery was delayed 7 to 25 days (mean, 14 days) to allow liquefaction of the blood clot and reduce intraocular inflammation. All eyes underwent posterior drainage sclerotomies under constantly maintained limbal fluid infusion line pressure, followed by pars plana anterior and posterior vitrectomy in five of six eyes. Additionally, two eyes underwent secondary lens implantation during surgery and 6 months later, respectively. Mean follow-up was 10 months. Visual acuity improved in all eyes from a preoperative range of light perception-hand motions to hand motions-20/40. Advantages and disadvantages of this aggressive surgical approach in the management of MSCH are discussed.\r"

Laminin and both heparan sulfate proteoglycans and collagens types IV and V were co-distributed in discrete regions within the stroma. Glial and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell populations were identified in these membranes using specific immunohistochemical markers as was a small but significant macrophage population. Double-labeling experiments indicated that RPE cells in these membranes expressed the class II histocompatibility antigen HLA-DR, although neither the RPE monolayer in situ nor cultured RPE cells was HLA-DR positive unless induced by gamma interferon. Only rare isolated vascular endothelial cells were detected in 5 of the 23 membranes.\r"

All three proteins were detected in the vast majority of specimens (actin, 86%; FN, 95%; GFAP, 96%), although the extent of staining varied for each. Actin-FN co-localization was observed in all diagnostic groups on comparison of adjacent sections and in double-labeled sections. The extent of actin staining did not correlate with clinical grading of PRM contraction. In PDR membranes, FN staining was low overall, but proportional to the vascular content of the PRM. Fibronectin staining of PVR membranes was greater, and extensive even in avascular specimens. In MP membranes, most cells were GFAP-positive, whereas in PDR and PVR specimens, GFAP staining was variable. The lack of correlation of clinical contractility and membrane composition, as studied in this article by immunostaining, indicates that other factors must play significant roles in determining membrane behavior.\r"

  ".U": "89296261\r", 
  ".W": "Ameloblastoma, an odontogenic tumor of ectodermal origin, has been reported to arise, on rare occasions, in a primordial or dentigerous cyst of a young person. Numerous authors have suggested differing nomenclatures for these ameloblastomas (e.g., mural, unicystic, monocystic, intracystic, cystogenic, cystic, plexiform unicystic) and have sought to describe and classify the clinical and histopathologic features. These tumors have been characterized as a distinct variant exhibiting less aggressive behavior and a lower rate of recurrence than conventional ameloblastoma. Furthermore, various etiologic factors have been proposed for these cystic ameloblastomas, including (1) nonspecific irritational factors such as extraction, caries, trauma, infection, inflammation, or tooth eruption; (2) nutritional deficit disorders, and (3) viral infection. The files of the combined accessioned cases of Emory University's and Temple University's oral pathology laboratories were searched and a review of the literature was performed. Thirty-eight cases of mandibular ameloblastoma (37 intraosseous, 1 peripheral) in persons 19-year-old and younger were found from a combined total of 311 accessioned cases of ameloblastoma (12.2%). The average age at diagnosis was 10.4 years for the 18 males and 20 females. Of the 33 cases in which race was stated, 19 (57.6%) were white and 14 (42.4%) were black. In the 28 cases in which a clinical diagnosis was offered, fifteen (53.6%) were thought to be dentigerous cysts. Ten cases from patients less than 19 years old were investigated by means of an immunohistochemical staining technique for the detection of human papilloma virus (HPV) genus-specific structural antigen in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Three of the ten cases (cases 31, 37 and 38) were positive for HPV capsid antigen, whereas none of ten randomly selected ameloblastomas in adults was positive. A discussion of the clinical and histopathologic comparative findings, with emphasis on treatment results and possible HPV etiology, is included. The preliminary nature of finding HPV in the tumor cells is stressed, with recommendation for further verification and typing with the more sensitive in situ hybridization technique.\r"

Since the putative source of the epithelium giving rise to an intraosseous carcinoma is the epithelium involved in odontogenesis, these lesions are often designated as odontogenic carcinomas. These tumors may theoretically arise (1) from the lining of odontogenic cysts, (2) from other epithelial odontogenic tumors, or (3) de novo from presumed odontogenic rests. While not included in most classifications of PIOC, it appears logical to also include intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinomas as a fourth type of PIOC. A case of primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma of the mandible, with evidence of origin in an odontogenic cyst, is presented. The recent literature on carcinomas arising in jaw cysts is reviewed.\r"

On the basis of our examination of the clinical and histologic features of this lesion and a comparison with the previous cases, we agree with the recent suggestion that the tumor should be designated as a central odontogenic fibroma, granular cell variant. By means of S-100 protein immunostaining techniques, the granular cells in this lesion were compared with the granular cell population in a granular cell tumor (myoblastoma) and the mesenchymal component of an ameloblastic fibroma. The results reveal a lack of S-100 protein reactivity in the granular cells of the central odontogenic fibroma and suggest an origin of those cells different from the origin of cells in a granular cell tumor.\r"

Clearly, a price is paid, but careful evaluation and judicious weighing of the costs and benefits can vastly expand our reconstructive capabilities. Furthermore, as our knowledge of microvascular anatomy expands, new donor sites with particular attributes and less donor site morbidity are constantly being described. The profusion of new procedures and techniques over the last decade is, perhaps, unparalleled in any surgical specialty. Such techniques not only extend our definitions of what is \"salvageable,\" but also refine our conception of what is functionally or cosmetically acceptable. This enables us not only to extend the indications for limb sparing surgery, but also to move beyond merely \"salvaging\" extremities to reconstructing functional, cosmetically appealing limbs. These are, to be sure, arduous, complicated cases requiring considerable planning and commitment on the part of the surgeon and the patient, but a successful outcome is extremely gratifying to both parties.\r"

There is virtually no place for denying surgical treatment to the majority of these cases, because it would most probably leave them in a painful, bedridden state. The risks of operative intervention and the use of methylmethacrylate along with fixation devices are justified when analyzing the end results of relief of pain, ambulatory activity, and restoration of function, as well as psychologic benefits. The use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy along with surgery has greatly enhanced the management of this disabled patient population. Fracture healing can take place in the presence of extensive destructive lesions. Survival rates are improving and earlier recognition of skeletal metastasis by newer technology, including bone scanning and computerized axial tomography, is helpful in the overall management of these patients. The goals of treatment can be achieved by proper planning and a multidisciplinary approach to the patient with metastatic skeletal disease.\r"

Additional improvement based on the altered pattern of pulmonary metastases has also been reported. Preoperative chemotherapy has facilitated surgical resection of the primary tumor. The effects on the primary tumor may be utilized as a predictive factor and to design postoperative adjuvant therapy. Similar results have been achieved in Ewing's sarcoma with survival rates in the vicinity of 50 to 80 per cent. The interaction of chemotherapy with radiation has augmented the ability to achieve local control of the primary tumor. The tumoricidal properties of chemotherapy in destroying micrometastases may possibly also contribute to local control. Finally, initial treatment with chemotherapy may yield a complete response and facilitate definitive surgical treatment of the primary tumor. This may eliminate the need for radiation therapy and its delayed consequences.\r"

The patients and the treatments were randomized according to the Latin square design to eliminate all possible period/climate biases throughout the protracted study period. The treatments consisted of terbutaline, 5 mg, theophylline, 200 mg, the combination, and placebo, given twice daily orally and crossing over every 28 days. The two drugs, administered alone or in combination, improved lung function and symptoms when compared with placebo. The interaction of theophylline and terbutaline was quantitatively shown by 2 x 2 factorial statistical design to be essentially additive rather than synergistic in the control of asthma. No increase in side effects was noted when the combined therapy was used. These findings suggest therapeutic advantages to combining submaximal oral doses of sustained-release theophylline and terbutaline for the long-term treatment of children with asthma.\r"

Academic pediatric departments located in the United States were surveyed to gather information regarding a number of issues relevant to the operation of their GPCs. These issues include educational efforts related to practice management, personnel allocation, financial performance, organizational formats, administrative arrangements, and access to primary care services for children of poor families. Of 131 surveys, 94 were returned (72% response rate). There were an average of 15,486 visits per year to GPCs, and the number of visits overall has increased by 11.9% during the past 5 years. Educational efforts related to practice management vary greatly within GPCs; less than half report any. The overall staff ratios per faculty physician are similar to those in nonteaching practices but differ in composition because of training activities inherent to GPCs. There is an average loss of $250,000 per clinic at GPCs. Organizational formats vary considerably; the majority of physician directors have no line-management authority for nursing and clerical staff. Survey results confirm that GPCs serve a large number of poor children with 41.3% funded by Medicaid and 16.0% unable to pay out-of-pocket expenses. GPCs are generally not used to teach practice management, tend to lose money, and have little faculty involvement in their management.\r"

Since cutaneous inflammatory responses and subjective sensations may be diminished in aged skin, a higher degree of vigilance in physical examination is needed to reach a proper diagnosis. Prevention of many of the cutaneous signs of aging and of most skin cancers is dependent upon sun avoidance. Thus, the best advice physicians can offer patients of any age is to limit sun exposure by using a sunscreen with a high sun-protection factor, to avoid being in the sun during the peak tanning hours (between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM), and to wear protective clothing when exposed to the sun.\r"

The erroneous diagnosis is often reversed by a second opinion, thereby causing loss of patient confidence and damage to pride and self-esteem in the initial physician. To avoid these problems, the physician should look for the cause of the hypothyroidism, which is easily and reliably established in about 95% of patients. In the rare instance that one is not evident, it may be prudent for the primary care physician to seek consultation before prescribing lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\r"

  ".W": "There is considerable interest in the potential of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to develop drug resistance, especially as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (Retrovir) is now in widespread clinical use to treat people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC). To address this possibility, mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase [deoxynucleoside-triphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed), EC 2.7.7.49] gene have been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of cloned constructs in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the recombinant mutant reverse transcriptase from a number of these constructs revealed enzymes that maintained enzyme activity but had a reduced ability to recognize inhibitors such as azidothymidine triphosphate. To assess the infectivity of these mutants, several constructs of proviral HIV clones with mutant reverse transcriptase genes have been made and used to transfect T cells. All five mutants tested have lower infectious potential, suggesting considerable levels of reverse transcriptase activity are required for efficient virus replication. Viable virus recovered from two clones showed decreased sensitivity to the antiviral compound phosphonoformate, thus demonstrating the potential for drug-resistant HIV to replicate. However, although the reverse transcriptase from these mutant viruses showed decreased sensitivity to azidothymidine triphosphate, paradoxically these viruses were hypersensitive to azidothymidine when tested in culture.\r"

Similar to its human counterpart, yeast TFIID also exhibited specific binding to the adenovirus type 2 major late promoter TATA element, as shown by both DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift assays. NaDodSO4/PAGE analyses showed that a 27-kDa polypeptide coeluted with TFIID complementing activity through each chromatographic step. In agreement with this result and also suggesting that the native protein is a monomer, gel-filtration experiments indicated a molecular mass of 28 kDa for TFIID under nondenaturing conditions. That the 27-kDa polypeptide represented TFIID was further demonstrated by the ability of an HPLC-purified protein to bind specifically after renaturation to the adenovirus type 2 major late promoter TATA sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Serine proteases are one of the biologically most important and widely distributed families of enzymes. Isolation of serine protease genes from organisms of widely diverged phylogenetic groups would provide a basis for studying their biological function, the relationship between structure and function, and the molecular evolution of these enzymes. Serine proteases for which little structural information is known are those that are important in the pathogenesis of parasitic nematode and protozoan diseases. Identification and isolation of protease genes from these organisms is a critical first step in understanding their function for the parasite and possibly suggesting innovative approaches to arresting parasitic diseases. Serine protease gene fragments were isolated from genomic DNA of the parasitic nematode Anisakis simplex by using degenerate oligonucleotide primers and the polymerase chain reaction. Primers were designed based upon the consensus sequence of amino acids flanking the active site serine and histidine residues of eukaryotic serine proteases. Four serine protease gene fragments from this parasite were sequenced and one is 67% identical to the rat trypsin II gene. Alignment of these two genes revealed that the intron-exon junctions are conserved between nematode and rat suggesting that this Anisakis serine protease is structurally and functionally similar to rat trypsin. The generality of this approach to identify serine protease genes from genomic DNA of two very divergent species, a parasitic protozoan and a mammal, was also confirmed. Genes for other enzymes or any protein with conserved structural motifs can be identified and isolated using this technology. Using a similar strategy, a cathepsin B-like cysteine (thiol) protease gene fragment was isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans DNA.\r"

The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed for biological activity. This procedure identified four regions critical to activity. These critical regions were further delineated by additional three-amino acid deletion mutants. Larger deletions at each terminus were also made, as well as changes of specific amino acid residues. The four critical regions span amino acid residues 18-22, 34-41, 52-61, and 94-115. The disulfide bridge between Cys-51 and Cys-93 was also shown to be essential for activity, whereas that between Cys-85 and Cys-118 could be removed without loss of activity. The possible structural and/or functional roles of the critical regions are discussed.\r"

RNA analyses demonstrated that the chicken vimentin gene was efficiently expressed in an appropriate tissue-specific pattern and that the transcripts were properly processed, as in chicken, giving rise to two RNAs. The vimentin transgene was predominantly expressed in lens at levels of up to 10-fold the endogenous level in every transgenic line studied. The chicken vimentin transcripts were efficiently translated into polypeptides that were modified posttranslationally and could assemble into the mouse cytoskeleton. Overexpression of the chicken vimentin gene did not obviously affect the expression of the endogenous gene at the RNA or the protein level. Immunofluorescence microscopy further demonstrated that the chicken protein was properly expressed spatially in lens. However, the levels were much higher in the transgenic animals.\r"

No incorporation was observed when naturally methylated isolated 30S particles were used, showing that methylation at unnatural sites did not occur. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the labeled RNA to nucleosides followed by HPLC analysis identified the [3H]methylated residues. Activities for the formation of N6-methyladenosine, N6-dimethyladenosine, 5-methylcytidine (m5C), 3-methyluridine, and N2-methylguanosine were found. Fractionation by ammonium sulfate partially resolved the different activities. All of the fractions with m5C activity were 6-8 times more active on synthetic unmethylated 16S RNA than on synthetic 30S ribosomes, whereas the N2-methylguanosine activity preferred 30S ribosomes to 16S RNA by a factor of more than 10. The N6-methyladenosine and N6-dimethyladenosine activities were 30S ribosome-specific. The m5C activity present in the 55-85% ammonium sulfate fraction of the high salt wash yielded a maximum of 1.0 mol of m5C per mol of 16S RNA, although two m5C residues, positions 967 and 1407, are found in vivo. RNase protection by hybridization with the appropriate oligodeoxynucleotide identified the methylated residue as C-967. Methylation of m5C-967 did not require prior methylation of G-966, and methylation of A-1518 and A-1519 was not dependent on prior methylation of G-1516.\r"

  ".W": "The cGMP phosphodiesterase of vertebrate retinal rod outer segments plays a key role in visual transduction. A functionally active form of the inhibitory gamma subunit of the phosphodiesterase, which keeps the enzyme inactive in the dark, has been obtained in high yield from a synthetic gene expressed in Escherichia coli. A DNA sequence encoding the 87-residue bovine gamma subunit was chemically synthesized and assembled from 10 oligonucleotides. The synthetic gene was cloned into an expression vector that uses the promoter PL of lambda phage. E. coli was transformed with this vector, which encodes a fusion protein consisting of the first 31 residues of the lambda cII protein, a 7-residue joining sequence that is specifically cleaved at its C-terminal end by clotting protease factor Xa, and the 87-residue gamma subunit. The fusion protein was solubilized in 6 M urea and purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a CM-Sephadex column. The typical yield was 1 mg of fusion protein per liter of bacterial culture, which corresponds to the amount of gamma in about 2500 bovine retinas. Proteolytic cleavage of the fusion protein by factor Xa released a synthetic gamma with the same amino acid sequence as that of native gamma. Both fusion protein and synthetic gamma inhibited trypsin-activated phosphodiesterase with high affinity (Kd less than 100 pM). Likewise, both were as effective as native gamma in inhibiting transducin-activated phosphodiesterase in rod outer segment membranes. This inhibition was reversed by the activation of additional transducin. Thus, the N terminus of gamma is not intimately involved in interactions with either the catalytic subunits of the phosphodiesterase or the activated form of transducin. In contrast, a C-terminal deletion mutant terminating at residue 74 of gamma stimulated rather than inhibited the trypsin-activated enzyme. Thus, the C-terminal region of gamma is critical for inhibition of the phosphodiesterase.\r"

The mutation affected crucial functional roles of the 30S subunit in the initiation of protein synthesis.

  ".W": "The iron and acid-labile sulfide contents and the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) properties of hydrogenase I (bidirectional) and hydrogenase II (uptake) of Clostridium pasteurianum (strain W5) have been determined on the basis of quantitative amino acid analyses. The iron and acid-labile sulfide values are approximately 20 and 18 atoms per molecule of hydrogenase I and 14 and 11 atoms per molecule of hydrogenase II, respectively. These amounts are substantially greater than previously reported values, which relied on protein concentration determined by colorimetric assay. The oxidized hydrogenases exhibit unusual EPR signals that originate from a novel type of iron-sulfur center, termed the hydrogenase or H cluster, which covalently binds the inhibitor CO. This EPR signal represents approximately one unpaired electron per molecule in each enzyme with and without bound CO, which is consistent with the presence of one oxidized H cluster (S = 1/2) per enzyme molecule. The two enzymes also contain ferredoxin-type four-iron centers or F clusters. The EPR signals from the F clusters observed in the reduced forms of hydrogenase I and hydrogenase II account for approximately four and one unpaired electron per molecule, respectively. We conclude from the iron determinations and the EPR results, together with a reevaluation of previous spectroscopic data, that in both hydrogenases the H cluster probably comprises six iron atoms. Mechanistic models of the two hydrogenases are presented that account for their cluster compositions and the dramatic differences in their catalytic activities.\r"

We have constructed a variety of mutant alleles of the Escherichia coli flagellin gene. Mutant flagellins with large internal deletions or truncations of their C-terminal region could still be exported, even though they could not assemble into filament. The most extreme example was a fragment containing only the N-terminal 183 residues of the 497-residue wild-type flagellin. This result suggests that the N-terminal region of flagellin contains a signal that enables the protein to be recognized and exported by the flagellum-specific pathway.\r"

However, high levels of interferon (10(3) units/ml) could be induced upon trans-activation by the product of the tat gene (pIIIextatIII), and de novo infection by HIV resulted in a moderate increase (400 units/ml) in alpha 2-interferon synthesis. In contrast to the fully permissive HIV replication, in transfected Vero cells or infected A3.01 cells, the transcription and replication of HIV in Vero or A3.01 cells containing the HIV long terminal repeat--alpha 2-interferon hybrid gene (VN89 and A3N89 cells, respectively) was completely inhibited.

SDS/PAGE of stereociliary proteins resolved 12-15 major bands. Actin, previously identified as a component of the stereociliary core, was identified in purified stereocilia as a band comigrating with authentic actin and by phalloidin labeling of intact isolated stereocilia. Fimbrin was identified in immunoblots of purified stereocilia. The most abundant other proteins migrated at 11, 14, 16-19, 27, and 36 kDa. Demembranated stereociliary cores consisted primarily of protein bands corresponding to actin and fimbrin and several proteins ranging from 43 to 63 kDa. Because the adaptation mechanism in hair cells is calcium-sensitive and seems localized to stereocilia, we sought evidence for calcium-binding proteins in stereocilia. Calmodulin and calbindin antibodies labeled stereocilia in intact cells. A protein band in purified stereocilia exhibited a Ca2+-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility identical to that of authentic calmodulin, and the 27-kDa band may represent calbindin. These biochemical data demonstrate that stereocilia consist of a relatively small set of proteins. Most of these, including those involved in transduction and adaptation, are as yet uncharacterized. The availability of purified stereocilia should prove useful in further studies of structure-function relationships in these mechanically sensitive organelles.\r"

When MPM-2 (0.7-1.4 micrograms per oocyte) was injected into oocytes prior to progesterone stimulation, MPF activity failed to appear and induction of maturation was inhibited as judged by both germinal-vesicle breakdown and white-spot formation. Further, MPM-2 was able to neutralize as well as immunodeplete MPF activity from mitotic HeLa cell and mature oocyte extracts. These results suggest that MPM-2 recognizes either MPF itself or a protein(s) that regulates MPF activity and that the kinase that phosphorylates MPM-2 antigens may be a key component in the regulation of M-phase induction.\r"

  ".W": "The lily retrotransposon del 1-46 is 9345 base pairs (bp) long. It has long terminal repeats (LTRs) of 2406 bp (left) and 2415 bp (right), which differ in sequence by 1.4%. Sequences similar to those involved in priming DNA synthesis in retroviruses occur in the internal region. Near the left LTR is a sequence complementary to 18 residues at the 3' end of methionine initiator tRNA of three plant species, and a run of 12 purines occurs close to the right LTR. One internal reading frame of del 1-46 has relatively few stop codons. The 1462-codon product from this frame has motifs, in N to C terminus order, corresponding to those identified with RNA binding, protease, reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and integrase functions in retroviruses and certain other retrotransposons. Amino acid sequence comparisons of three conserved pol regions show del to be closely related to the Ty3 retrotransposon of yeast (37-40% identity). del is also related to the gypsy group of Drosophila (17.6, 297, gypsy/mdg4, and 412), showing closer identity with their reverse transcriptase (32-38%) and RNase H (36-45%) domains than with their integrase domain (21-26%). It is proposed that a gypsy group ancestor exchanged the integrase region with a more distantly related element since its divergence from a del/Ty3 common ancestor. The occurrence of related retrotransposons in three different kingdoms (plants, animals, and fungi) strongly implies their horizontal transmission in recent evolutionary time.\r"

The DNA sequence for the phoP locus indicates that it is composed of two genes present in an operon, termed phoP and phoQ. The deduced amino acid sequence of the phoP and phoQ gene products are highly similar to other members of bacterial two-component transcriptional regulators that respond to environmental stimuli. S. typhimurium strains with transposon insertions that create transcriptional and translational gene fusions that require phoP and phoQ for expression have been isolated and have different chromosomal locations, indicating that this system is a regulon. One of these fusion strains, containing a mutation in a gene termed pagC, has a virulence defect. Other strains, including those containing mutations in the phoN gene, encoding an acid phosphatase, have wild-type virulence. Strains with pagC, phoP, or phoQ mutations have decreased survival in cultured mouse macrophages. When used as live vaccines in mice, strains with phoP or phoQ mutations afford partial protection to subsequent challenge by wild-type S. typhimurium.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) produced by macrophages is thought to contribute to the host defense against development of cancer. However, since tumor cells themselves are able to produce TNF, it is conceivable that TNF may also play an adverse pathological role in carcinogenesis. To better understand the functional significance of TNF in neoplastic disease, we have determined the cellular source of TNF activity produced in 10 patients with colorectal cancer. Northern blot analysis of RNAs extracted from fresh biopsy specimens revealed detectable TNF mRNA levels in all instances. By using in situ hybridization of frozen sections, scattered cells expressing TNF mRNA could be discerned. Based on morphological criteria, these TNF-positive cells most likely belong to the macrophage lineage. Macrophages in normal tissue surrounding the tumor did not express TNF mRNA, suggesting that macrophage activation occurs locally at the site of neoplastic transformation. Immunohistochemistry using anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies revealed that less than 1% of tumor-infiltrating macrophages synthesize TNF protein. Thus we present evidence that in colorectal cancer only a small proportion of tumor-infiltrating macrophages produces TNF, indicating that the microenvironment of the tumor provides adequate, yet suboptimal, conditions for macrophage activation.\r"

  ".W": "Although it is clear that human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and progesterone play fundamental roles in pregnancy, the regulation of placental production of these hormones remains to be defined. Recent evidence suggests that the human placenta expresses proteins related to inhibin (alpha beta subunits) or activin (beta beta subunits). Inhibin and activin (follicle-stimulating hormone-releasing protein) possess opposing activities in several biological systems including pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (follitropin) secretion, erythroid differentiation, and gonadal sex-steroid production. The actions of purified inhibin and activin on hormonogenesis by primary cultures of human placental cells were studied. The addition of activin increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and progesterone production and potentiated the GnRH-induced release of hCG. Inhibin by itself did not modify placental immunoreactive GnRH, hCG, and progesterone secretion but reversed the activin-induced changes. Neither inhibin nor activin influenced the release of human placental lactogen. Furthermore, transforming growth factor beta, structurally related to inhibin/activin, did not significantly influence hormone release from cultured placental cells. These results support the hypothesis that inhibin and activin may play a role in regulating the release of GnRH, hCG, and progesterone from placenta and implicate inhibin-related proteins in the endocrine physiology of human pregnancy.\r"

In addition to the adrenal glands, testis, and ovaries, renin transcripts are detected in the liver, whole brain, and hypothalamus and, at lower levels, in spleen, thymus, lung, and prostate. Expression of the rat renin gene correlates with that of the mouse Ren-1 gene with the notable exception of the submaxillary gland where renin transcripts are found only in mice. The levels of renin transcripts in the liver of females from both species are higher than in males. In mice, the relative levels of Ren-1 and Ren-2 transcripts vary widely in different tissues. These results support the hypothesis of a local renin-angiotensin system in multiple extra-renal sites and imply the existence of complex mechanisms of regulation of the renin gene, previously thought to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner.\r"

The vpu protein complements in trans the defect in a vpu- HIV-1 provirus but does not affect the simian immunodeficiency virus, which lacks vpu. These observations suggest that vpu may contribute to the AIDS epidemic by increasing the transmission efficiency of the virus.\r"

We have cloned from S. typhi Ty2 a chromosomal region that confers upon Escherichia coli HB101 the ability to invade cultured human intestinal epithelial cells. Three invasion-positive recombinant cosmids were isolated and restriction endonuclease analyses of the inserts showed a 33-kilobase region of identity. Transmission electron microscopy of epithelial cells invaded by S. typhi Ty2 or E. coli HB101 carrying an invasion cosmid showed intracellular bacteria contained within endocytic vacuoles. One of the invasion cosmids was mutagenized with transposon Tn5 to identify the cloned sequences that are required for the invasive phenotype. Seven of 92 independent Tn5 insertions within the common 33-kilobase region eliminated invasive ability and revealed at least four separate loci that are required for invasion. Penetration of epithelial cells by Ty2 and HB101 carrying the cloned invasion determinants was inhibited by cytochalasin B and D, indicating that epithelial cell endocytosis of S. typhi is a microfilament-dependent event. The invasion cosmids were found to carry the recA and srlC genes indicating that the cloned invasion determinants are located at about 58 minutes on the S. typhi chromosome. With a segment of the cloned S. typhi invasion region used as a probe, homologous sequences were isolated from Salmonella typhimurium. Two independent S. typhimurium recombinant cosmids containing the entire 33-kilobase common region identified in S. typhi were isolated, but these cosmids did not confer upon HB101 the ability to invade epithelial cells.\r"

After intracortical infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (DL-APV) for one day, iontophoretic responses to NMDA, to kainate, and to quisqualate revealed a receptor blockade specific to NMDA receptors and extending several millimeters from the cannula. In this region, neuronal responses to visual stimulation were profoundly suppressed, in a manner strongly correlated with the degree of NMDA receptor blockade. Neither NMDA receptor blockade nor activity suppression was caused by the inactive stereoisomer L-APV. Hence, we conclude that NMDA receptors make a major contribution to normal excitatory transmission in adult visual cortex.\r"

To determine whether similar neurotransmitter receptors are also expressed by glia in vivo, we examined the glial scar in the transected optic nerve of the albino rabbit by quantitative receptor autoradiography. Receptor binding sites for radiolabeled calcitonin gene-related peptide, cholecystokinin, galanin, glutamate, somatostatin, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide were examined. Specific receptor binding sites for each of these neurotransmitters were identified in the rabbit forebrain but were not detected in the normal optic nerve or tract. In the transected optic nerve and tract, only receptor binding sites for substance P were expressed at detectable levels. The density of substance P receptor binding sites observed in this glial scar is among the highest observed in the rabbit forebrain. Ligand displacement and saturation experiments indicate that the substance P receptor binding site expressed by the glial scar has pharmacological characteristics similar to those of substance P receptors in the rabbit striatum, rat brain, and rat and canine gut. The present study demonstrates that glial cells in vivo express high concentrations of substance P receptor binding sites after transection of retinal ganglion cell axons. Because substance P has been shown to regulate inflammatory and immune responses in peripheral tissues, substance P may also, by analogy, be involved in regulating the glial response to injury in the central nervous system.\r"

An example would be an algorithm designed to guide the physical therapist through the process of being the first evaluator of a patient with low back pain (Physical Therapy Department, US Public Health Service Hospital, San Francisco, Calif; unpublished data; 1976). The review of the system occurs at the first step (collect initial data). The examination of the patient occurs at step three. Step four would be to generate a working hypothesis that could lead either to referral to an appropriate practitioner or to continuation through the next step in this algorithm. The HOAC system requires the physical therapist to deal with defined problems and to document the actions that have been taken. This system lends itself to peer review and quality assurance questions. It helps the physical therapist to review his or her own performance, and it can help to identify weaknesses in patient management and at which step in the process these weaknesses occurred (eg, at the goal-setting level, at the hypothesis-generation level). By creating a better understanding of the performance of the physical therapist, this model can help determine which continuing education needs must be met. This method can also help us to understand the scientific basis for practice in that it requires testing of assumptions of treatment planning and goal achievement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our goal with patients should be to couple the knowledge of the unique patient to the knowledge in the literature and get the best possible match. This approach requires combinatorial versus probabilistic thinking. In the real world, ideal matches are not found. Therefore, it is critical to exhaust the patient's uniqueness first and only then use probabilities to settle further uncertainties. It is an error to teach people how to deal with uncertainty instead of teaching them to clean up a great deal of the uncertainty first. Patients must be involved in this endeavor. In essence, they have a PhD in their own uniqueness, and it is this uniqueness that is very powerful in solving complex problems. This method of patient evaluation and management cannot be used with the unaided mind. It requires new and powerful information tools like the PKC. All information that is relevant to a problem should be included in the coupler. It should encompass differing points of view, and the rationale should be made explicit to clinician and patient alike. When complete, the coupler should represent an interdisciplinary compilation of questions and tests that are expected to be collected every time in the clinic for the type of problem the coupler represents. This method will provide a basis for quality control because the contents of the coupler now have defined what we expect to occur in every patient encounter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 19 patients who underwent nephrectomy, despite the presence of FMD, five (26.3%) developed hypertension over a mean follow-up interval of 4.4 years. In comparison, three subjects (6.1%) (from a randomized control group of 49 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals) developed hypertension over a mean follow-up period of 7.1 years. The authors conclude that asymptomatic middle-aged individuals with renal FMD develop hypertension at a rate greater than that of age-matched control subjects with normal blood pressure.\r"

To determine the prevalence, sonographic characteristics, and clinical outcome of this phenomenon, discharge summaries, placental pathologic reports, and prenatal sonograms from 307 twin pregnancies were reviewed. Of 52 cases of MCDA pregnancies, 18 (35%) demonstrated marked disparity in amniotic fluid volume. In 16 of these 18 cases there was discordant twin growth, further suggesting the diagnosis of twin transfusion syndrome. All 16 cases and an additional nine cases supplied by another center demonstrated a small, morphologically normal fetus in an oligohydramniotic sac suspended anteriorly (72%) or laterally (28%) in the uterus. The amniotic membrane separating this twin from the larger twin in the polyhydramniotic sac was thin, closely applied to the smaller fetus, and difficult to detect. Perinatal morbidity was 100% for all twin pairs, and premature labor occurred in all cases. Perinatal mortality ranged from 88% for the larger/poly twin to 96% for the small/oligo twin.\r"

The risk of development of an abnormality increased as the time from irradiation increased and was comparable between patients who did and did not receive chemotherapy as part of the treatment regimen. Although the pathologic correlates of the various abnormalities seen on sonograms may differ, the findings indicate a need for long-term follow-up of patients who underwent cervical irradiation for Hodgkin disease.\r"

All examinations were performed and images interpreted by the same experienced individuals. The basilar, internal carotid (ICA), and anterior and middle cerebral arteries were seen in all infants. Vertebral, posterior cerebral, superior cerebellar, and posterior communicating (PCoA) arteries were seen in most infants. PCoA flow was from the ICA toward the posterior cerebral artery in 73 (98.6%) of the 74 vessels that were seen. Flow in the anterior communicating artery was seen in six infants, indicating dependence of an anterior cerebral artery on contralateral ICA perfusion. Two pitfalls involving the distal portion of the ICA were noted: This vessel could be confused with the proximal portion of the anterior cerebral artery or cavernous sinus if real-time images were not interpreted carefully. Variant patterns of flow included tortuous basilar arteries (n = 2), reversed PCoA flow (n = 1), and inferior angulation of the proximal portions of the anterior cerebral arteries (n = 2). Color Doppler imaging allows a detailed analysis of the circle of Willis in newborns and detection of some anatomic variations.\r"

Patients with clinical complications demonstrated variable degrees of pancreatic inhomogeneity and peripancreatic inflammation on CT scans. These findings were similar in appearance to pancreatitis in the native gland. Most patients proved to be undergoing acute rejection. However, these findings were not specific and were also seen with peripancreatic infection, hemorrhage, and exocrine anastomotic leaks. No CT changes were detected in two of three patients with late rejection. Thus, CT was not helpful in the diagnosis of pancreatic rejection. The most beneficial role of CT was in the detection of intraabdominal fluid collections, including abscesses, hematomas, and pseudocysts. Percutaneous aspiration was invaluable in the distinction between infected and sterile fluid collections; however, percutaneous drainage was of limited use in treatment.\r"

Appearance of CMV infection on radiographs was generalized and hazy (n = 9) or limited to one lobe (n = 4). All episodes of P carinii pneumonia, including six combined with CMV infection, appeared diffusely hazy. Aspergillus infection appeared either shaggy and nodular (n = 3) or bibasilar and hazy (n = 2). Aspergillus infection developed only early after transplantation (0.2-2.5 months), whereas CMV infection (1.1-6.1 months) and P carinii pneumonia (2.6-10.3 months) developed later (time ranges for latter two infections exclude three episodes that developed even later in two patients at risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Nine (8%) patients died of pulmonary infection, eight (7%) within 4.0 months of transplantation. Symptoms or signs were variable; none were found in four (10%) of 41 episodes. The authors recommend frequent chest radiographs in the early months after transplantation.\r"

Imaging studies included computed tomography (CT) during arterial portography (CTAP), delayed CT, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at various pulse sequences. Results of radiologic studies were compared with surgical and pathologic findings. In the combined group of surgical and nonsurgical patients, CTAP was significantly more sensitive (85%) than all other techniques except 1.5-T T2-weighted spin-echo imaging (64%). Combining the information from all MR pulse sequences yielded a cumulative sensitivity of 68%. Combining the information from two modalities yielded sensitivity of 96% for CTAP plus MR imaging, 85% for CTAP plus delayed CT, and 77% for delayed CT plus MR imaging. The authors conclude that when it is vital to know the precise number, size, and location of focal hepatic lesions before tumor resection, CTAP has the highest sensitivity, but MR imaging is an important adjuvant.\r"

The locations of underlying diseases were the inferior aspect of the left lobe of the liver (three patients), the gallbladder (three patients), and the right hepatic duct (two patients). An understanding of the anatomic detail of the ligamentous attachments of the liver and the continuity of peritoneal ligaments is important in recognizing the ligamentous spread of hepatobiliary disease. This mode of spread of disease should be kept in mind in diagnostic imaging of the abdomen.\r"

Twenty-four patients had biliary tract dilatation; of this group 88% had pancreatic calcifications and 75% had a focal mass in the pancreatic head. Sixteen of the 24 patients underwent follow-up studies; in 12 there was no change in the degree of biliary tract dilatation or appearance of the pancreas. The levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin were elevated in most of the 24 patients; at follow-up, however, there was no consistent relationship between these values and radiologic findings. Biopsy is recommended for those patients in whom the serum alkaline phosphatase level remains persistently elevated. Four of seven such patients in this study underwent biliary-enteric bypass procedures due to pathologic evidence of cholestasis.\r"

The contributions of different glucose transport proteins to insulin resistance in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes was evaluated. A glucose transporter messenger RNA and its cognate protein that are exclusively expressed in muscle and adipose tissue were specifically depleted in diabetic animals, and these effects were reversed after insulin therapy; a different glucose transporter and its messenger RNA that exhibit a less restricted tissue distribution were not specifically modulated in this way. Depletion of the muscle- and adipose-specific glucose transporter species correlates with and may account for the major portion of cellular insulin resistance in diabetes in these animals.\r"

In this study, the efficacy of cefotetan, a broad spectrum cephamycin antibiotic, given alone (n = 315), is compared with that of the combination of cefotetan and metronidazole (n = 300). The groups were well matched for age, sex, pathologic features and operations performed. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of operation-related infection between the two groups. We conclude that cefotetan given alone is as effective as the combination of cefotetan and metronidazole for prophylaxis against operation-related infection in elective colorectal operations.\r"

The overall complication rate has decreased from an initial 32.5% to 9.0% in recent series. A unique case of small-bowel obstruction caused by intraluminal migration of the reservoir of an inflatable penile prosthesis is described. It was successfully managed by resection of the affected bowel loop and extraperitoneal reimplantation of the reservoir. Although general surgeons are not involved in the placement of these devices, it is important for us to be aware of the possibility of erosion and migration of the component parts, which may result in potentially lethal gastrointestinal and other complications that we may be called on to assess.\r"

We describe a case of major hepatic hemobilia in a patient with cirrhosis and no history of trauma. A 50-year-old woman had abdominal pain, melena, and profound anemia. An extensive workup did not show the site of bleeding but did show a mass in the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy was performed, and at operation the patient was found to have cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The gallbladder \"mass\" was simply an organized clot, and hemorrhage recurred postoperatively. On reoperation, bleeding from the ampulla of Vater was observed, confirming the diagnosis of hemobilia. She was treated with angiographic interruption of hepatic arterial flow, at which time bleeding ceased. Her total transfusion requirements included 46 units of blood. Through 16 months of follow-up the patient has had no recurrent bleeding and no evidence of encephalopathy. This case demonstrates that spontaneous hemobilia may indeed arise from a cirrhotic liver. Proximal interruption of arterial flow is usually not recommended for hemobilia, especially in the presence of portal hypertension and cirrhosis, but may be life-saving in selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "Anatomic alterations of the pancreas result in physiologic alterations that have not been completely analyzed. Insulin plays a major role in carbohydrate metabolism; nevertheless, as much as 50% of a hyperglycemic load may be metabolized independent of insulin. We analyzed the effects of surgical alterations of the pancreas on postoperative glucose metabolism, including insulin-independent effects. Mongrel female dogs underwent one of three procedures: proximal partial pancreatectomy (PPx), PPx plus diversion of pancreatic venous effluent to the systemic circulation (SC), or PPx plus segmental pancreatic autotransplantation (PAT). Intravenous glucose tolerance tests, with or without a background infusion of somatostatin (SST; 400 ng/kg/min) were performed on all animals preoperatively and postoperatively. SST completely suppressed secretion of assayable peripheral insulin. The rate of glucose disposal during SST suppression approximates the rate of insulin-independent glucose disposal (IIGD). Although there was a significant decrease in the rate of glucose disposal during SST infusion when compared with the rate without SST, no differences in IIGD were found between postoperative groups. IIGD was calculated at 50% to 55% for control, PPx, and SC groups and at 67% for PAT. Peripheral sensitivity to an exogenous insulin infusion (euglycemic clamp) was unchanged by any of the procedures. We conclude that surgical alteration of the pancreas, including pancreas transplantation, results in altered glucose handling in the face of \"normal\" peripheral levels of insulin. Changes in IIGD and analysis of peripheral sensitivity to insulin do not explain these alterations completely.\r"

  ".W": "Assuring equitable access of patients to needed organ transplants is a responsibility that must be shared by transplantation teams, the patients, their families, referring physicians, and society as a whole. Barriers of major proportion still exist that strongly bias the initial selection of patients for placement on waiting lists and adversely affect the rates of transplantation among the older age groups, nonwhites, and the poor. The very issue of making up the waiting list is fundamental to the development of fair and equitable distribution of the national resource of organs for transplantation. Actual organ allocation must involve medical judgment and must strive to achieve the maximal benefit to patients. Despite dangers of paternalism and bias masquerading as medical criteria, to overlook outcome predictions in selecting the recipient of a scarce resource is to be irresponsible toward the donor and society as well as to the patients on the list. Insofar as benefit and need can both be served, as in the case of liver transplantation for fulminant liver failure or kidney transplantation in a well-matched recipient, these considerations should far outweigh the poor criterion of length of time on the waiting list. In many instances, it will be the most appropriate choice to give the organ to a patient waiting on the list at home rather than to a desperately ill patient who will doubtlessly die without the operation but whose risks of failure are significantly higher. As difficult as these decisions are, especially in life and death situations, a system of organ allocation based on medical judgment, with appropriate safeguards and thorough monitoring, eventually will prove to be the fairest method.\r"

Those of us who have cared for large numbers of the poor commonly acquire a great respect for the almost noble way many face severe or chronic illnesses. Many times, these people approach self-sacrifice in order to protect or provide for their families or dependents. We need to place less effort in considering if a person is black, Scot, Mexican, Arabic, and so on and more effort providing good education and access to economic independence to the underprivileged in our society. Thus, I end as I started. There are no transplantation issues related to race. There are only transplantation issues related to human beings.\r"
