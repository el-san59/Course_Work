The stool chymotrypsin concentrations increased from birth to a maximum at 4 days of age and then fell again over the next four days. The lowest individual stool concentrations either side of the four day peak were both, coincidentally, 120 micrograms/g stool. In a second group of 22 newborn babies suspected of meconium ileus and later confirmed to have cystic fibrosis, faecal chymotrypsin concentrations were all appreciably reduced. In eight babies, also with suspected meconium ileus but with negative sweat tests, chymotrypsin concentrations were within the healthy newborn range. Measuring faecal chymotrypsin concentrations is a reliable procedure for identifying pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in the newborn.\r"

Biochemically the disease is characterised by metabolic acidosis and organic aciduria. Treatment with biotin results in pronounced, rapid, clinical and biochemical improvement, but some patients have residual neurological damage comprising neurosensory hearing loss, visual pathway defects, ataxia, and mental retardation. The cause of this permanent damage remains obscure and it is not clear if the early introduction of treatment will prevent it.\r"

In 17 of 18 index cases the diagnosis was based on the rapid detection of adenovirus hexon antigen in the nasopharyngeal mucus specimens and in one case (the only adult index case) on isolation of the virus. All index cases had high temperatures associated most commonly with tonsillitis, acute otitis media, gastroenteritis, or febrile convulsions. In 14 of the 16 families with symptomatic contacts the index case was the first symptomatic case, or one of the first symptomatic cases, in that family. Fifteen (94%) of the siblings and 20 (56%) of the parents had signs and symptoms of acute infection during the follow up period. In 10 (63%) and eight (20%) of these cases, respectively, adenovirus was confirmed. The mean (SD) incubation period of confirmed adenovirus infections was 10 (3) days. The observations show that adenovirus infection spreads actively to other siblings in the family. Rapid diagnosis permits parents to be informed prospectively about the expected spread and clinical picture of the illness in the family.\r"

Using duplex Doppler we measured the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity in a group of full term (n = 15) and premature infants (n = 17, median gestational age 31 weeks) in response to a transient threefold increase in oxygen tension. Measurements of blood gas tensions as well as blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity were made over a period of 20 minutes on three occasions for each infant; during normal oxygenation, hyperoxia, and normal oxygenation. There was a fall in cerebral blood flow velocity in 15 of the 17 premature infants with hyperoxia and the median reduction was 0.06 cm/second for every 1 kPa increase in oxygen tension. There was no significant change in either PCO2 or blood pressure during the period of hyperoxia. The cerebral blood flow velocity fell in all 15 infants born at full term during hyperoxia, but there was a simultaneous and significant reduction in PCO2 at the same time as the hyperoxia. Analysis of variance suggested that in the infants born at full term the change in carbon dioxide had most effect in the reduction of cerebral blood flow velocity, rather than the hyperoxia itself. We conclude that in premature infants, cerebral vascular resistance may be altered by a fall in cerebral blood flow velocity in the presence of hyperoxia.\r"

For survivors weighing 501-1250 g in whom incidence of serious handicap was 21%, neonatal fits and the need for mechanical ventilation carried significantly increased risks of later serious handicaps. In contrast, for survivors weighing 1251-2000 g in whom the incidence of serious handicap was 6%, significant factors were spontaneous, uncomplicated preterm delivery, recurrent apnoea, and abnormal neonatal neurological findings. The probability of dying was assessed in two ways--firstly, using seven clinical factors available on admission to the neonatal unit, and secondly, using 10 perinatal and neonatal factors. Handicapped survivors had a perinatal risk between that of those babies who survived and that of those who died. Of the handicapped survivors, those with spastic diplegia and hemiplegia had been extremely low risk babies (medians 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively), whereas those with other impairments had much higher risks (range 17.5-38.1%). We postulate that certain impairments arise independently of clinical events, although most occur in children who had complicated perinatal courses.\r"

Each echocardiogram was done in a standard manner and cardiac anatomy was analysed segmentally. Twelve fetuses were excluded from analysis because of lack of follow up. Of the remaining 123 fetuses, 109 had no evidence of heart disease when followed up. In this group the prenatal echocardiogram was normal in 105 and technically inadequate in four; thus there were no false positive diagnoses of heart disease in fetuses subsequently shown to have normal hearts. Fourteen had heart defects at follow up. The serious defect was correctly diagnosed prenatally in 10 of 14 cases, whereas in the other four the prenatal echocardiogram was considered normal. Some errors were made in diagnosing associated segmental defects particularly if the heart disease was complicated. Therapeutic abortion was carried out in seven cases; in five of the fetuses the prenatally diagnosed heart defect was the sole or an important contributing reason for the abortion. We conclude that echocardiography is a reliable method for diagnosing many heart defects in the mid trimester.\r"

The neonatal mortality was 11 (36%), the main cause of death being pulmonary hypoplasia. Two infants died of sepsis, but these were the only proved episodes of maternal or fetal infection. Of the survivors, 27% developed compressive limb abnormalities, all of which responded to passive physiotherapy. Pulmonary hypoplasia was significantly associated with earlier onset of rupture of the membranes, and the absence of fetal breathing movements. Compressive limb abnormalities were significantly associated with longer periods of oligohydramnios. We conclude that premature rupture of the membranes, even with onset in the second trimester, may be associated with a favourable outcome and this may be predicted by the persistence of fetal breathing movements. We therefore, recommend expectant management of such pregnancies, but suggest elective delivery at 34 weeks to limit fetal exposure to uterine compression and minimise the risks of prematurity.\r"

Lead was distributed unequally among the different bones in distinct patterns that were age-, and to some extent, sex-dependent. To estimate lead concentration of the entire skeleton, all skeletal bones were divided into 5 groups based on their approximate compact/trabecular bone ratios, considering each of our 5 sampled sites to be the prototype for each such group. Regression analysis of the 10 possible bone site pair values at different ages yielded age-related constants. These constants were incorporated into an equation we developed that can be used both to estimate mean skeletal lead concentration (Pb) of the entire body skeleton and also to predict the lead concentration at any of the other 4 bone sites if any 1 of the 5 is measured. Applications of these data to in vivo bone lead measurements are detailed with respect to selection of the site to be measured, estimation of total skeletal lead burden, anticipated variations or error, and dependence of these factors on age and sex of the sampled population.\r"

Their blood lead levels were 35-60 micrograms/100 ml and erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels were greater than 100 micrograms/100 ml. Neurological examination revealed that they had a significantly higher incidence of pathological findings (e.g., muscle hypotonia, increased tendon reflexes, dysarthria, and dysdiadochokinesia) than children from an unpolluted area who were matched for age, sex, family size, and educational and socioeconomic status of the parents, but who had normal erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels. The children with elevated blood lead levels showed, after assessment by the Oseretsky test, retardation of motor maturation; they also scored higher on the minimal brain damage scale of the Rutter behavioral questionnaire. These differences persisted at a 4-yr follow-up, and their school performance was consistently poorer than that of the controls.\r"

Sulfur dioxide exposure concentrations were 0.0, 0.3, and 0.6 ppm. Experimental conditions were presented in random order at 1-wk intervals. Exposures lasted 10 min with heavy continuous exercise. Lung function was measured at baseline, after pretreatment (immediately pre-exposure), immediately post-exposure, and during a 2-hr follow-up. Subjects could elect to take bronchodilators during follow-up. Symptoms were monitored before, during, and for 1 wk after exposure. With no pretreatment, subjects exhibited typical exercise-induced bronchospasm at 0.0 ppm, slightly increased responses at 0.3 ppm, and more marked increases at 0.6 ppm. Seven subjects took bronchodilator after 0.6-ppm exposures, compared to 2 at lower concentrations. Within 30 min post-exposure, most subjects' symptoms and lung function had returned to near pre-exposure levels. A similar sequence was observed when subjects received placebo. Drug pretreatment improved lung function relative to baseline, prevented bronchoconstrictive responses at 0.0 and 0.3 ppm, and greatly mitigated responses at 0.6 ppm. Thus, typical bronchodilator usage by asthmatics is likely to reduce their response to ambient SO2 pollution.\r"

It was hypothesized that perceived residential proximity would better predict concern levels that would actual residential distance. The data were abstracted from a New York State, excluding New York City, survey using all respondents (N = 317) from one county known to have a large number of TWDSs. Using linear regression, the variance explained in concern scores was 22 times higher with perceived distance than for actual distance. Perceived residential distance was a significant predictor of concern scores, while actual distance was not. However, perceived distance explained less than 5% of the variance in concern scores.\r"

  ".W": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are one of the most commonly occurring cancers in the age groups heavily represented in the U.S. Navy. The Navy has a wide range of potential occupational exposures. This study was initiated to identify any occupational associations of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that may adversely affect naval readiness. The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in U.S. Navy active duty enlisted personnel during the period 1974-1983 with the general U.S. population, and to assess if risk varied by naval occupation or length of service. The Naval Health Research Center's computer-based disease registry was used to conduct a prospective study of all white U.S. Navy enlisted men during 1974-1983 to test for the existence of any short-term risk possibly due to occupation. Men in 80 occupations, ranging from clerk to journalist to machinist and boiler operator were observed for 3,704,864 person-years; mean length of service was 5.1 yr, but 19% of person-years were contributed by men who had served at least 11 yr. Incident cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were identified and verified using Medical Board findings or review of original medical records. Average annual age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated. Examination of pathology records and medical review boards confirmed 68 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The annual age-adjusted incidence rate per 100,000 person-years in Navy men was significantly lower than in the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population, probably due to screening and other selection factors associated with Navy service that result in a healthy worker effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of acute 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCE) inhalation on left ventricular contractility and influence on heart rate were investigated in anesthetized dogs. In the acute inhalation experiment, a decrease in the maximum left ventricular dp/dt (peak dp/dt) was observed following inhalation of higher 1,1,1-TCE contentrations. The threshold concentration of 1,1,1-TCE that decreased peak dp/dt was approximately 0.2% in inspired air. A dose-response relationship was observed between the decrease in peak dp/dt and 1,1,1-TCE concentration. Heart rate recorded simultaneously increased with relatively low concentrations and decreased with higher concentrations. Increase or decrease in peak dp/dt was observed to be dependent on changes in heart rate induced by right atrial pacing. Thus, the degree of the decrease in peak dp/dt during pacing experiments was compared with those of nonpacing experiments. At low concentrations, peak dp/dt during pacing decreased more than in nonpacing experiments. With higher concentrations, the decreases in peak dp/dt during pacing was slightly less than in the nonpacing experiments. Heart rate may be important in regulating peak dp/dt for relatively low 1,1,1-TCE concentrations. However, the effect of heart rate on peak dp/dt is slight at higher concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Data from fifty-five patients who had hepatic resections for colorectal liver metastases at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) were analyzed to determine the effect of perioperative blood transfusions on disease recurrence and overall survival. Besides blood transfusions, other factors included in the analysis were size, number, and distribution of metastases, margin status of resected metastases, length of disease-free interval, Duke's stage of the primary tumor, type of hepatic resection, and anesthesia time. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, the amount of blood transfused was found to be a significant prognostic factor. For each additional unit of blood transfused the risk of disease recurrence and death was increased by 5% (p = 0.0015) and 7% (p = 0.0013), respectively. The median disease-free survival for patients who received 3-5, 6-10, and greater than or equal to 11 transfused units was 26, 12.1, and 11.4 months, respectively. The median overall survival for patients who received 3-5, 6-10, and greater than or equal to 11 transfused units was greater than 44, 39.2, and 33.6 months, respectively. The number of resected nodules (1-2 vs. greater than or equal to 3), type of resection (anatomic lobectomy vs. wedge resection), and nodule size (less than or equal to 3.0 cm vs. greater than 3.0 cm) were additional factors that were further evaluated to determine the effect of blood transfusions. Analyses stratified for each of these factors revealed that patients who received greater than or equal to 11 units of blood had a significantly decreased disease-free and overall survival compared with patients who received 3-10 units of blood. It is concluded that the amount of perioperative blood transfused is an independent prognostic factor that adversely effects disease-free and overall survival.\r"

Clinical and demographic data, as well as indications for CT (such as hematuria, abdominal tenderness, distention, contusions, and abrasions) were recorded prospectively at the time of CT examination. Hematuria was present in 256 children (68%). Of these, 168 (66%) had microscopic blood (greater than or equal to 10 RBC/HPF), 52 (20%) had a positive dip-stick (less than 10 RBC/HPF), and 36 (14%) had gross hematuria. Both the presence and increasing amount of blood in the urine were associated with significantly higher risk for abdominal injury, multiple organ trauma, and renal injury. Yet when asymptomatic hematuria was the only indication for CT examination, the risk of any abdominal injury was negligible (0 of 41 patients). The presence and severity of hematuria can be useful markers of underlying abdominal injury only in association with other suggestive clinical signs and symptoms. Asymptomatic hematuria is a low-yield indication for abdominal CT in children with blunt abdominal trauma.\r"

Simultaneous gastric and duodenal bulb pH were measured during fasting, the ingestion of a solid meal, and for the remainder of the 24-hour period. The gastric pH profile was similar for both groups. There was no significant difference between the fasting duodenal bulb pH of the duodenal ulcer (DU) patients and controls. The daytime and nocturnal duodenal acid exposure was similar for both groups. The meal caused a similar pattern of duodenal acidification in both controls and DU patients, and acid neutralization appeared to be effective in DU patients. The role of acid in the duodenal bulb does not appear to be of primary pathophysiologic importance in duodenal ulcer disease.\r"

Although it is clear that these fibers are contained within the vagus nerve trunks, the intra-abdominal pathways of these fibers are unknown. When a neurotracer was applied to the right gastroepiploic pedicle, nerve cells in the bilateral dmnX were labeled. If a preliminary anterior or posterior pyloroplasty was performed before the application of the neurotracer, cellular labeling was seen on the right or left side of the dmnX, respectively. Furthermore, division of the anterior Latarjet nerve eliminated labeling in cells of the left dmnX. This study demonstrates that the preganglionic vagus nerve fibers within the right gastroepiploic pedicle traverse an intramural course across the pylorus and are contained in the Latarjet nerve.\r"

Despite this and a comprehensive follow-up of patients with long-standing, extensive colitis, primary colorectal carcinomas were diagnosed in only three patients, all of whom had total colitis. This was significantly (p less than 0.001) more than the expected number of patients with colorectal cancer in this subgroup, namely, 0.13. There were no deaths in colorectal carcinoma. Factors determining completeness of inclusion are discussed, and it is concluded that, in an unselected series of patients with ulcerative colitis, close cancer surveillance is indicated, although prophylactic surgery does not seem to be generally warranted.\r"

Overall treatment success was achieved in 89% of cases (mean follow-up of 12 months), with four patients undergoing continued therapy. Of the patients who received a full course of treatment, only two (4%) were not taken to complete photoablation. Complications were minimal, and 92% of all laser treatments were done on an outpatient basis. Four patients had documented polyp recurrence that was controlled with additional laser treatment. Two patients with malignant polyps who were not surgical candidates were also treated with the laser, with no tumor recurrence seen at 11 and 14 months. Nd-YAG laser photoablation of large colonic polyps offers a safe, efficient, and cost-effective alternative to standard surgical resection.\r"

  ".W": "Repair of recurrent groin hernias is associated with a high incidence of repeat recurrences (2-19%). Reported herein is a 10-year experience of the management of recurrent groin hernias through the use of the preperitoneal approach with the addition of a reinforcing prosthetic mesh buttress. Two hundred and three recurrent groin hernias in 195 patients (192 men, three women) were treated between July 1975 and October 1986. The preperitoneal approach to the inguinal region was performed under regional anesthesia to define the nature of the recurrent hernia. Initial experience in a randomized trial between the use of local endogenous tissue repair versus endogenous repair with a prosthetic polypropylene mesh buttress demonstrated superiority of the latter in reducing repeat recurrences of anatomically defined direct or combined recurrent hernias. Pure indirect and femoral recurrences did not mandate mesh reinforcement. Long-term follow-up was available for 115 hernias (56%) in 102 patients (52.3%) over a period of 6 months to 10 years. Eight patients had repeat recurrences a mean of 30 +/- 22 months after repair. Six recurrences (four direct, two indirect) occurred in an early experience, when no mesh was used. Two recurrences (one indirect and one lateral to the mesh) representing 1% of all hernias (1.7% of those followed-up) have occurred after routine use of the mesh buttress, with the last re-recurrence seen in December 1982. Three ventral hernias (1.5%) occurred at the wound of entry, but none have occurred since placement of the mesh was modified to cover this wound. There were five (2.5%) wound infections and one (0.5%) hydrocele with no re-recurrences. It is concluded that the preperitoneal approach to recurrent groin hernias, together with the appropriate use of a reinforcing mesh buttress, is safe, allows anatomic definition of the hernial defect, and is followed by few repeated recurrences. The evolution of this approach during the last 10 years has made it the procedure of choice for the management of all recurrent groin hernias at the University of Illinois College of Medicine.\r"

All patients were evaluated for CAD by clinical and laboratory methods, including stress electrocardiogram (ECG) and radionuclide studies, and monitored perioperatively with serial ECGs, measurements of serum enzymes, filling pressures, and cardiac output. No one died, but 3.7% had myocardial infarct, 2.5% had heart failure, and 8.1% had arrhythmias. Cardiac complications were rare in patients without clinically evident CAD and in those in Goldman's classes I and II. It appears that patients without clinically detectable CAD can be operated upon with a low risk if they are carefully evaluated and monitored.\r"

The drug regimens were ASA 1 mg/kg/day, DPM 10 mg/kg/day, combined ASA and DPM (ASA + DPM), and CLO (1.8 g/day eicosapentanoic acid [EPA] and 1.2 g/day docosahexanoic acid [DHA]), and control. The early angiographic patency rate (1-3 weeks) was 81% +/- 10% (+/- 70% confidence limits); the 90-day overall patency rate was 60% +/- 4% (87/144), with no statistically significant differences among the groups (range 46 +/- 10-71 +/- 9%). Qualitatively, there was no difference in luminal thrombus, intimal hemorrhage, or lesion eccentricity. Considering the relatively short time of graft implantation, an extensive amount of microscopic disease was observed; quantitatively, the mean intimal thickness was 515 +/- 17 microgram overall but was not statistically different between the groups. The fraction of potential lumenal area occupied by intimal thickening was 0.37 +/- 0.01 but again did not differ significantly between the groups. These doses of ASA, DPM, ASA + DPM, and CLO did not alter graft occlusion or retard the marked degree of subintimal myointimal cell hyperplasia that was generated in this hypercholesterolemic canine veno-arterial allograft preparation. Possible explanations for these negative findings include inadequate dosage or form of omega-3 fatty acids and the antiplatelet drugs administered, excessive variability in graft response due to uncharacterized immunologic histocompatibility, and the possible influence of non-platelet-mediated mechanisms. Nevertheless, this preparation is attractive as a reproducible model of accelerated (immunologically mediated) experimental arteriosclerosis.\r"

Anesthetized dogs (n = 23) underwent 2 hours of hind limb ischemia induced by tourniquet inflation to 300 mmHg. In untreated animals (n = 7), tourniquet release led after 5 minutes to a rise in plasma thromboxane (Tx) B2 levels from 360 to 1702 pg/ml (p less than 0.05); after 2 hours, lymph TxB2 concentration had risen from 412 to 1598 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). There were decreases in circulating WBC from 11,766 to 6550/mm3 and platelets from 230 to 155 x 10(3)/mm3. During reperfusion, popliteal lymph flow (QL) increased from 0.07 to 0.24 ml/hour (p less than 0.05), while the lymph/plasma (L/P) protein ratio was unchanged from 0.39, changes consistent with increased microvascular permeability. WBC depletion (n = 7) to 302/mm3 by hydroxyurea or nitrogen mustard attentuated (p less than 0.05) the reperfusion induced rise in plasma TxB2 from 91 to 248 pg/ml and prevented the increase in lymph TxB2 concentration. Within 5 minutes of tourniquet release WBC counts further decreased to 191/mm3 (p less than 0.05) and platelets declined from 175 to 93 x 10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.05). QL increased from 0.07 to 0.12 ml/hour (p less than 0.05), lower than untreated animals (p less than 0.05), and the L/P protein ratio declined from 0.49 to 0.37 (p less than 0.05), dilutional changes consistent with increased filtration pressure but not permeability to protein. Pretreatment with the lipoxygenase inhibitor diethylcarbamazine (DEC) (n = 8) prevented the reperfusion-induced increase in plasma and lymph TxB2 levels (p less than 0.05) and the fall in WBC counts (p less than 0.05), while platelet counts declined from 381 to 210 x 10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.05). QL rose from 0.09 to 0.23 ml/hour (p less than 0.05) during reperfusion, and the L/P protein ratio of 0.3 remained unchanged, a value lower than in untreated dogs (p less than 0.05). In two animals of each group, vascular recruitment was induced by tourniquet inflation to 50 mmHg. This led to a high QL of 0.25 ml/hour and a low L/P ratio of 0.18. In untreated animals during reperfusion, QL further increased to 1.3 ml/hour, and L/P ratio rose to 0.44, documenting increased vascular permeability. In contrast, reperfusion in leukopenic or diethylcarbamazine (DEC)-treated dogs with vascular recruitment, was not associated with increases in QL or the L/P protein ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This study tests the role of circulating leukocytes (WBC) in mediating this lung injury. Anesthetized sheep prepared with chronic lung lymph fistulae underwent 2 hours of bilateral hind limb tourniquet ischemia. In untreated controls (n = 7), 1 minute after reperfusion there were transient increases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) from 13 to 38 mmHg (p less than 0.05) and pulmonary microvascular pressure (Pmv) from 7 to 18 mmHg (p less than 0.05), changes temporally related to a rise in plasma thromboxane (Tx) B2 levels from 211 to 735 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). Lung lymph TxB2 levels rose from 400 to 1005 pg/ml at 30 minutes (p less than 0.05), and remained elevated longer than plasma levels. Lung lymph flow (QL) rose from 4.3 to 8.3 ml/30 minutes (p less than 0.05) after 30 minutes of reperfusion and remained elevated for 2 hours. The lymph/plasma (L/P) protein ratio was unchanged from 0.6, while the lymph protein clearance increased from 2.6 to 4.6 ml/30 minutes (p less than 0.05), suggesting increased microvascular permeability. WBC counts decreased within the first hour of reperfusion from 6853 to 3796/mm3 (p less than 0.05), and lung histology after 2 hours showed proteinaceous exudates and leukosequestration of 62 PMN/10 high-powered fields (HPF), higher than the 22 PMN/10 HPF (p less than 0.05) in sham animals (n = 3). Recruitment of the pulmonary vasculature by left atrial balloon inflation (n = 3) resulted in a rise in MPAP to 20 mmHg. After 3 hours of balloon inflation, QL stabilized at 9.8 ml/15 minutes, and a pressure-independent L/P protein ratio of 0.3 was achieved. During reperfusion, QL increased further to 11.2 ml/15 minutes, the L/P ratio rose to 0.56 and the calculated osmotic reflection coefficient decreased from 0.70 to 0.44, documenting an increase in lung microvascular permeability. In contrast to these untreated ischemic controls, sheep (n = 7) rendered leukopenic with hydroxyurea or nitrogen mustard and having a total WBC count of 760/mm3 and PMN count of 150/mm3 did not manifest reperfusion-induced increases in MPAP, Pmv, QL, lymph protein clearance, or lung lymph. TxB2 level (p less than 0.05). Plasma TxB2 levels rose slightly at 30 minutes from 199 to 288 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). Lung histology was normal. These data indicate that WBC mediate the ischemia-induced increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability.\r"

  ".W": "Poland's anomaly is an uncommon congenital aberration of the chest wall characterized by absence of the pectoralis major muscle and other nearby musculoskeletal components. In this series, a wide spectrum of thoracic deformities was associated with the Poland anomaly, ranging from segmental agenesis of the ribs, sternum, and nearby muscles, to simple aplasia of the pectoralis major muscle. Although little disability was associated with the syndrome, the patients primarily sought operative correction due to the asymmetry and their perception of adverse cosmesis. Over a 10-year period, 53 operations were performed on 27 individuals with the goal of correcting the abnormal contour of the chest wall. The most successful reconstructions involved the use of the latissimus dorsi muscle, which was detached and transferred to the anterior chest wall while preserving the neurovascular pedicle. In women, this was accompanied by insertion of a mammary prosthesis. Reconstruction of the so-called \"herniation\" of the lung with rib grafts or alloplastic materials was found to be unnecessary, and the use of custom-made chest wall prostheses is not recommended, since four of five of these devices had to be removed due to migration, erosion of local tissues, and adverse cosmesis.\r"

Immediately after the surgical procedure, 0.1 ml saline containing 10(8) Staphylococcus aureus/ml was injected intradermally into six fields of each flap. After the operation, the dogs were caged in controlled environments with different oxygen concentrations at 12%, 21%, and 45% for 3 days. After 24, 48, and 72 hours, lesion size was measured. Different lesion size was noted between the hypoxic and the hyperoxic groups in the MC flaps from the first day on and in the RP flaps from the second day on (p less than 0.05). Resistance to infection with S. aureus is oxygen dependent, particularly when tissue PO2 is below 40 mmHg.\r"

There were 426 patients (25.8% of the total) with N2 M0 disease. Of these, 345 underwent pulmonary resection with mediastinal lymph node dissection. The 5-year survival in this group was 15.9% (T1 N2 M0, 30.0%; T2 N2 M0, 14.5%; and T3 N2 M0, 12.9%). In the remaining 81 patients, who did not have mediastinal lymph node dissection, 5-year survival was 6.7%. Of the 426 patients with N2 M0 disease, 242 were select patients who underwent a curative operation with an overall 5-year survival of 19.2%. Sixty-six of them had squamous cell carcinoma and a 5-year survival of 30.8%; 153 had adenocarcinoma and a survival of 16.0%; 14 had large cell carcinoma and a survival of 12.8%; and 9 had adenosquamous cell carcinoma, and none survived 5 years. To improve the end results, it is important to perform as many curative operations with mediastinal lymph node dissection as possible. Histological cell type and tumor status must be taken into consideration.\r"

One hundred fifty-two animals were excluded because of clinical recovery, early death, or complications related to intrathoracic polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bead placement. The remaining 57 animals had clinical signs of empyema thoracis and were the subjects of this study. Group I animals (N = 24) served as the controls and had no therapy. Group II animals (N = 14) were treated by intrathoracic placement of placebo PMMA beads. Group III animals (N = 19) were treated by intrathoracic placement of tobramycin sulfate-impregnated PMMA beads. There were no differences between the groups in pleural reaction or pneumonia scores. These findings demonstrate a similar host response to the established infection. Group III, however, had a higher sterilization rate than Groups I and II (p less than 0.05), a finding underlining the therapeutic effect of tobramycin-treated PMMA beads. We conclude that intrathoracic local antimicrobial therapy with slow-release tobramycin-impregnated PMMA beads may enhance empyema treatment by increasing the rate of local sterilization. More experiments are necessary to assess the efficacy of this potentially important therapeutic arm for the treatment of thoracic empyema.\r"

  ".W": "The advent of hospice programs and their funding under Medicare has recently made eligibility for substantial insured services turn on whether a patient has less than three or six months to live. The implicit assumption is that physicians can provide this prediction accurately. To test this assumption and to improve predictions, the life spans of 108 consecutive applications for inpatient hospice care were estimated independently by two oncologists, an internist, an oncology nurse, and a hospice social worker, based on data in a ten-page multidisciplinary application packet. The applicants were followed up until death. Actual life span was correlated with predictions. The median (+/- SD) life span was 3.5 +/- 12.4 weeks. The predictions as a group were overly optimistic about survival by an average of 3.4 weeks. The best prognosticator's prediction was only moderately correlated with actual life span, and no two prognosticator's predictions correlated closely with one another. Predicting actual interval until death was more accurate than predicting a 90% confidence interval around the time of death, though the latter procedure was better at avoiding the error of unpredicted long-term survivors. This imprecision in \"expert\" estimation of life span poses substantial problems for hospice programs and policymakers.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether cancer patients with fever and neutropenia differ in their medical stability, 261 medical records of 184 cancer patients who were hospitalized with fever and neutropenia and treated with conventional antibiotic therapy were studied to determine whether their presenting clinical characteristics influenced the likelihood of subsequent clinical events thought to require urgent medical attention. Overall, serious medical complications, including those without an obvious relationship to infection, occurred in 56 patient courses (21%). We distinguished three clinically determined subgroups of our study population at significantly higher risk than the remaining patient group, which seemed to be at low risk. Major complications occurred in 34 (34%) of 101 inpatients, 12 (55%) of 22 outpatients with concurrent comorbidity requiring inpatient care, and eight (31%) of 26 outpatients without concurrent comorbidity requiring inpatient care but with uncontrolled cancer. However, the remaining patients, who presented as outpatients without significant comorbidity or uncontrolled cancer, had major complications in only 2% of 112 hospitalizations. These results suggest that it may be possible to assess the medical stability of patients with fever and neutropenia based on presenting clinical features. If confirmed prospectively, these results may enable clinicians to identify groups of medically stable patients for whom conventional supportive care, including appropriately administered antibiotics, may be given safely under medical supervision of less intensity or of shorter duration than conventional treatment in the acute-care hospital setting.\r"

Of 43 consecutive patients with AIDS who underwent CPR, 23% were revived in the initial attempt, whereas of 293 patients with other diseases 42% were revived. One (2.3%) of 43 patients with AIDS survived until hospital discharge, and his arrest was iatrogenic, as opposed to 19 (6.5%) of 293 patients with diseases other than AIDS. A respiratory mechanism for the arrest was significantly more common in patients with AIDS. The duration of the unsuccessful attempt did not vary significantly; a higher number of temporary pacemakers was used in patients with diseases other than AIDS indicating a more invasive approach. Survival until hospital discharge is minimal in our series of patients with AIDS, undergoing CPR. We recommend that informative discussions take place early in the course of the disease to provide patients with a better understanding of the available options in case of cardiorespiratory arrest.\r"

We assessed the possible role of family history and its interrelationship with cigarette smoking as risk factors for lung cancer in women by conducting a case-control study. Among 112 cases, 7% had a primary family member with lung cancer compared with only 3% of 224 controls for an odds ratio of 2.8. Cigarette smoking was present for 87% of the cases and 41% of the controls for an odds ratio of 11.3. The ecogenetic interrelationship of cigarette smoking and family history was supported by the gradient in the odds ratio for lung cancer created by the two variables: patients who never smoked but had a positive family history had an odds ratio of 5.7; patients who smoked but had a negative family history had an odds ratio of 15.1; and patients who smoked and had a positive family history had an odds ratio of almost 30. We conclude that family history may be an important risk factor for lung cancer in women, and that the ecogenetic interrelationship of family history with cigarette smoking may help explain the occurrence of this disease in women.\r"

Patients with IF were more often women, had a longer duration of symptoms, and were younger. Palpitations, syncope, and hypotension occurred only in patients with IF, while wheezing and abdominal pain occurred only with CS; diarrhea occurred in both types of patients. Elevated blood serotonin levels were present primarily in CS. Increased levels of urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was specific for CS but unsufficiently sensitive to detect all cases. Abnormalities of gut and vasoactive peptides failed to distinguish the two conditions. Flushing in carcinoid patients responds uniformly to octreotide (Sandostatin), but only one third of the patients with IF are relieved of the symptom. Patients with IF have features that distinguish them from individuals with flushing from other causes, such as CS, postmenopausal state, chlorpropamide-alcohol flush, panic attacks, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and autonomic epilepsy. Familiarity with the clinical and biochemical features of IF should facilitate evaluation and identification of these patients.\r"

We conducted a prospective study of coronary angiography in a teaching and community hospital staffed, respectively, by cardiologists who were performing cardiac catheterization as salaried or fee-for-service physicians. The lower overall rate of negative angiograms at the teaching hospital correlated with the presence of a cardiac surgery unit and the increased referral of patients with documented coronary artery disease. The percentage of completely normal angiograms did not differ significantly between hospitals. The number of angiograms positive by a 70% occlusion criterion in patients not previously known to have coronary artery disease also did not differ greatly. Negative angiogram rates appeared to vary inversely with physician ability to set preangiogram probabilities of coronary artery disease. Our findings do not discount reimbursement as a strong incentive, but suggest other important determinants of coronary angiographic variation.\r"

We examined crude and attributable mortality rates and excess length of stay in 88 closely matched pairs of cases and controls with illnesses occurring between July 1983 and December 1986. The crude mortality rates for cases and controls were 57% and 19%, respectively; thus the attributable mortality rate was 38% with a 95% confidence interval of 26% to 49%. The risk ratio was 2.94 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.95 to 4.43. The median length of stay was 48 days for all cases and 40 days for all controls. An analysis of the length of stay for the 34 matched pairs that survived showed a median of 70 days for cases and 40 days for controls. Candida bloodstream infections represented 10% of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the period studied at our University Hospital; they are associated with a significant medical and economic burden well above that expected of the underlying diseases alone.\r"

For each case, physicians indicated (1) their willingness to proceed with treatment without seeking additional information, (2) their preferences for sources of supplementary information, and (3) their preferences for continued care responsibility. The results indicated that the nature of the particular vignette had a major impact on how physicians made treatment decisions. Also, having greater case-related experience and being younger led to greater willingness to proceed with treatment and preferences for continued care responsibility. Preferences for information sources were largely independent of either form of experience. Treatment decision making appears to be quite dependent on experience with similar problems and being up-to-date on current treatment procedures.\r"

We studied three autopsy-proved cases of PLS; six living patients in whom PLS was diagnosed clinically after comprehensive evaluations that excluded the alternative diagnoses; and two patients with this syndrome of PLS and antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity that clinically resembled PLS. Primary lateral sclerosis is now a respectable and permissible diagnosis.\r"

Diagnoses were made by the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule. No differences between groups in lifetime or point prevalence rates were significant. The rate of psychosis in the postoperative group (8%) approximated the lower estimates in previous studies. Thus, surgical treatment of seizures did not increase the risk for psychopathology. However, patients with temporal lobe electroencephalogram foci or tumor as the epileptogenic lesion were more likely to have serious disorders than other patients. Also, anxiety disorders were more prevalent in our patient groups than in the general population.\r"

The 2:1 ratio of females to males expected for patients with MS was observed in this sample (40:16), but the excess of females occurred entirely among the 31 MS patients with major affective disorder (27 females and four males). Bipolar probands with MS had significantly more relatives with affective disorder or MS than did unipolar probands with MS. The HLA-DR antigen frequencies in patients with MS categorized by type and family history of affective disorder suggest that it may be possible to validate such clustering of patients. We concluded that sex and other genetic factors are related to the affective symptoms in MS and emphasize the importance of psychiatric evaluation of these patients.\r"

We administered a pretested questionnaire by telephone to 81 nondemented patients with PD and to a same-sex married sibling without PD. The patients and their siblings were asked whether they or their spouse (as an internal standard) had been more likely to eat each of 17 food items between marrying and age 40 years. No item was associated with the presence of PD. Unexpectedly associated with the absence of PD were preference for nuts (odds ratio, 0.39), salad oil or dressing (pressed from seeds) (odds ratio, 0.30), and plums (odds ratio, 0.24). These three items have higher vitamin E content than the other 14 items in our questionnaire. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that vitamin E, as an antioxidant, may have prophylactic value against PD.\r"

The coefficient of variation of cell size was increased in the contact lens group compared with the control group; no significant difference in mean endothelial cell size was found. The percentage of seven-sided cells making up the endothelial cell mosaic was increased in the contact lens group compared with the control group (15% vs 12%, respectively). No difference in corneal clarity, central corneal thickness, endothelial permeability to fluorescein, or rate of flow of aqueous humor was found between the groups. There was a significant correlation between duration of lens wear and mean endothelial cell size. Extended-wear contact lens usage induces morphological changes in the corneal endothelium; these changes may progress as the duration of lens wear increases. We detected no functional impairment, however.\r"

To evaluate these observations, we reviewed stereoscopic disc photographs of 122 patients with primary open angle glaucoma. Twenty-one patients had unilateral cilioretinal arteries and bilateral primary open angle glaucoma with an intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg at presentation and a difference of 3 mm Hg or less between the eyes. Stereoscopic disc photographs and Goldmann visual fields were evaluated in a masked fashion.

Water content, as measured by a hand refractometer, was found to be about 63% for all three types of shields, and no statistically significant differences were found. These measurements indicate that collagen shields behave like 63% water-content hydrogel contact lenses (oxygen permeability estimated at 27 x 10(-11) cm2 mL O2/s mL mm Hg) with regard to oxygen transmission.\r"

The number of binding sites in cultured keratoconus cells for radioactive peanut agglutinin, wheat germ agglutinin, and Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin I, however, was similar to that found in normal controls. Using a second method with biotin-labeled lectins as probes, we confirmed that increased amounts of glycoconjugates would bind to concanavalin A and R communis agglutinin I in stromal cells of patients with keratoconus compared with those of the control subjects. This study suggests that plasma membranes of cells derived from some patients with keratoconus may contain elevated amounts of glycoconjugates with glucose and/or mannose, terminal galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine residues.\r"

  ".W": "With the method of corneal redox fluorometry, the autofluorescence of reduced pyridine nucleotides (PN) and oxidized flavoproteins (Fp) in rabbit corneal endothelium was measured as a function of storage time in McCarey-Kaufman (MK) medium and K-Sol medium. Measurements were started immediately after preparation of the corneal button, and the corneas were followed up for up to three weeks of storage. In both media, the PN/Fp ratio of the endothelium initially increased slightly in the first or second day and then began to decrease toward a level lower than baseline. This initial increase is possibly a result of an adaptive mechanism. The PN/Fp ratio maintained itself in the range of baseline values up to one week in MK medium but not in K-Sol medium. With scanning electron microscopy, the surface of the membrane and cell border were maintained for a three-week preservation period, and no apparent differences were found between the corneas stored in the two media. With transmission electron microscopy, the intracellular organelles appeared almost normal through one week of preservation in corneas stored in either media. During weeks 2 and 3, however, intracellular edema with increased endothelial thickness became prominent in the corneas stored in both media. Although no visual difference in the morphological features of the endothelium was apparent between corneas stored in either medium, computer-assisted morphometric analysis showed a statistically significant increase in the coefficient of variation of mean cell area for the corneas preserved in K-Sol medium but not for those preserved in MK medium.\r"

The fluorouracil concentrations in the cornea and the aqueous humor averaged about 20 micrograms/g at one hour. The former decreased to 0.5 micrograms/g at 24 hours, while the latter was 0.03 micrograms/g at ten hours or later. At five hours, the fluorouracil concentrations in the conjunctiva and sclera at the injection site were similar to those 180 degrees away from it, both averaging about 2 micrograms/g. They decreased to 0.3 through 0.9 micrograms/g at 24 hours. The fluorouracil concentrations in the cornea, conjunctiva, and sclera at 24 hours were still above the reported 50% inhibition levels for the cultured conjunctival fibroblast. These findings have potential clinical implications for the safe use of fluorouracil.\r"

The scalp flap is developed anteriorly to expose the orbital margin from the superior orbital rim to the zygomatic arch. The temporalis muscle is dissected from its bony attachments and bluntly retracted, providing maximal exposure of the lateral orbital wall. The orbitotomy proceeds as required. The case concludes with a layered closure. In selected patients, the coronal scalp flap provides improved exposure and postoperative aesthetics compared with approaches in which the skin and muscle layer are incised directly over the lateral orbit. Complications are infrequent.\r"

MTX was given as a bolus of 5-15 mg/week; the total cumulative dose ranged from 4,690 mg to 10,230 mg. Liver biopsies were performed on 21 of the patients to assess possible fibrosis and cirrhosis. Grade I histopathologic changes were found in 13 of the 21 biopsy samples, grade II changes were found in 3, and grade IIIA changes (mild fibrosis) were found in 5 specimens. None of the biopsy samples showed cirrhosis. Repeat biopsies were performed on the 5 patients with grade IIIA changes while they were still taking MTX. No progression of the fibrosis was noted. Two of the 5 samples, however, were graded IIIB because of portal and perilobular inflammation. Our findings support the premise that prolonged administration of oral MTX, when given as a weekly bolus at a low dose, does not cause cirrhosis or severe fibrosis in the rheumatoid arthritis patient who does not abuse alcohol.\r"

Although only 4 MTX-treated patients had light microscopic evidence of mild fibrosis, all had evidence of collagen deposition in the space of Disse near Ito cells and changes in hepatocyte lysosomes on electron microscopy. These findings were absent from control livers. Fibrinogen, fibronectin, and type IV collagen were identified by immunofluorescence in both MTX-treated patients and controls. We conclude that long-term MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis is associated with alterations in hepatic ultrastructure, including collagen deposition in the space of Disse and changes in hepatocyte lysosomes.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained from 5 patients with Raynaud's disease and from 27 normal controls. Natural and antibody-dependent killing was reduced in the total group of SSc patients compared with controls, but these differences were primarily attributable to patients with the diffuse form of the disease who were seen early in their illness (less than 5 years after onset). NK cell numbers were not significantly reduced in patients compared with controls, although lower numbers were observed in individuals with early diffuse disease. Other clinical parameters, such as treatment with D-penicillamine or the presence of scleroderma-specific autoantibodies, did not exert an independent effect on NK cell function. These findings suggest a possible central role for NK cells in the pathogenesis of SSc.\r"

The GLA-enriched diet suppressed significantly the cellular phase of inflammation (polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation, crystal phagocytosis, and lysosomal enzyme activity), but it had little effect on the fluid phase (exudate volume and protein concentration). In contrast, the EPA-enriched diet suppressed the fluid phase but not the cellular phase of inflammation. The findings indicate that the fluid and cellular phases of acute inflammation can be controlled independently. A combined diet of fish oil and plant seed oil (EPA-enriched and GLA-enriched) reduced both the cellular and fluid phases of inflammation. Thus, dietary provision of alternative substrates for oxidative metabolism (other than arachidonic acid) modifies monosodium urate crystal-induced acute inflammation.\r"

The scapular instantaneous center of rotation was observed to be located initially at, or near, the medial root of the scapular spine, and gradually migrated toward the region of the acromioclavicular joint as arm abduction progressed. A biomechanical model of the shoulder girdle was proposed by correlating the results from the present study with the electrical activity of the scapular rotators. This model is useful in demonstrating the true dynamic function of the muscles acting on the scapula as well as the mechanical efficiency of upward scapular rotation during arm abduction.\r"

At T-1 only seven charts were reviewed; ten charts were reviewed at T-2 and T-3. The frequency of fulfillment to audit criteria was calculated as the arithmetic mean. No weighting or preference was given to any of the items. P values were calculated utilizing the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric measures. The criteria by which the charts were reviewed were developed through the Delphi method of opinion convergence. Criteria were generated using the principle of optimal medical care. The categories included initial evaluation, treatment plan, outcomes and discharge plan. T-1 compared to T-3 yielded results in overall percentage of effectiveness of: physician, 81 v 90 (NS): nurse, 42 v 60 (P 0.043); occupational therapy, 62 v 58 (NS); physical therapy, 69 v 78 (NS); and social worker, 17 v 88 (P less than 0.001) Geographic isolation of arthritis rehabilitation patients improved measured aspects of their care but not uniformly throughout the rehabilitation team.\r"

The symptoms included nocturnal hand pain, paresthesia and weak grasp. Thirty-nine of the 80 employees had wrist ratios equal to or greater than 0.70. Twenty-four percent of the employees with wrist ratios less than 0.70 had abnormal electrodiagnostic studies compared with 74% of employees with wrist ratios greater than or equal to 0.70. Regression analysis performed on the data revealed a significant positive correlation between distal median motor latency and wrist ratio (P = 0.001).

  ".U": "89062030\r", 
  ".W": "Serum samples collected prospectively between 1982 and 1987 from a cohort of homosexual men were analyzed for HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Seven seroconverters who became infected between 1982 and 1984 and 12 seroprevalents who were already seropositive in 1982 remained free of AIDS. During the 6 year period, 1 seroconverter and 14 seroprevalents developed AIDS. Healthy seroconverters developed neutralizing antibodies slowly and reached moderate geometric mean titers (GMT) of 1:100 within 3 years of seroconversion. Healthy seroprevalents already had moderate titers in 1982, which increased markedly in 1985-1986 (GMT greater than 1:200) and subsequently returned to the previous level in 1987. Neutralizing antibody titers declined 3 years prior to diagnosis in men who developed AIDS and reached levels significantly lower than those of healthy counterparts 2 years before diagnosis. Analysis of neutralizing antibody activity to several HIV-1 isolates indicated that the lower titers of men who developed AIDS were not due to diminished group-specific reactivity. Thus, high neutralizing antibody titers correlated with better clinical outcome, and low or decreasing neutralizing antibody titer signaled poor prognosis. Although naturally developing neutralizing antibodies may ultimately be inadequate in controlling disease progression, measures able to boost the neutralizing antibody titer of individuals already infected with the virus or to elicit high-titer neutralizing antibodies in individuals at risk may yet prove beneficial in controlling viral spread in vivo or in preventing new infection, presumably in concert with cellular immunity.\r"

These assays can detect 500 COS cells in a population transiently transfected with a construct encoding gp120 and gp160, or 50 pg of recombinant gp160. We estimate that the mean amount of gp120 + gp160 in the transfected population is equivalent to 2.5 x 10(6) molecules per cell, 40-50% of which can be recovered from the culture medium as gp120 after 24 hours. The ELISA can be adapted to assess whether gp120 is detectable in the sera of HIV-1-infected persons: we show that gp120/gp160 is completely stable in normal human serum for at least 24 hours at 37 degrees C.\r"

Five distinct complexes formed with the enhancer repeat have been identified by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The distribution of these complexes varied qualitatively and quantitatively between nuclear proteins from different sources. In the extracts tested, transcription of the HIV-LTR 5' deletion mutants (-453/80, -176/80, -117/80, -103/80, -65/80, and -48/80) was initiated correctly. Transcriptional stimulation dependent upon the presence of the enhancer repeat sequences was observed in all nuclear extracts and was highest in Jurkat, Raji, and B cell extracts. The presence of specific factors and the functional activity of the enhancer repeats as well as other regulatory units in a variety of cells indicates limited host-cell restriction of HIV transcription initiation in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term CaCO3 treatment of chronic hemodialysis patients was studied. Single doses of CaCO3 were given to 25 patients, 23 of whom had been receiving Al(OH)3 before the study. When predialysis serum calcium (Ca) rose to greater than 5.5 mEq/L, CaCO3 was reduced and Al(OH)3 was administered again. Eighteen months later, serum phosphate (P) was well controlled, and predialysis serum P was less than 6.5 mg/dl in 14 patients given CaCO3 alone. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels significantly decreased, and serum aluminum was remarkably lowered in patients who had discontinued Al(OH)3. In patients who resumed Al(OH)3, ALP levels rose after Al(OH)3 administration. Although levels of c-PTH did not change in CaCO3 treated patients, six patients with poor control of serum P before the study showed a significant decrease in c-PTH. These data indicate that CaCO3 is an effective P binder that stops the progression of silent osteopathy, presumably caused by oral intake of Al(OH)3, and may ameliorate these changes. However, further effort will be necessary to develop means to control serum Ca, because long-term use of CaCO3 induced hypercalcemia in half the patients.\r"

  ".W": "The impending release of erythropoietin (EPO) is expected to result in a dramatic increase in hematocrit (Hct) for most hemodialysis (HD) patients. Our studies indicate that as Hct rises, dialyzer mass transport for some clinically critical solutes will be adversely affected. When whole blood clearances are corrected for solute-specific blood-water flows (QBH2O), the effect on the surrogate molecule, urea, used in urea kinetic modeling (UKM) is deceptively minimal, because only urea can diffuse almost instantly from red cells into blood water. For the critical solutes, potassium and phosphate, QBH2O is reduced to Q (plasma water). With a KoA of 690 ml/min at QB = 300, clearance of potassium falls at least 19.3% as Hct rises from 20 to 40% so that steady-state predialysis potassium could rise from 6.0 to 6.95 mEq/L. Already inadequate phosphate clearance falls at least 10% and additional loss results from physical interference by RBCs with solute diffusion. Hcts are further increased with rapid weight losses during high-efficiency dialyses (0.15 per 5% weight loss in 3 hours, r = 0.82) resulting in blood-side pressures such that most dialysis machines cannot provide adequate dialysate pressures to maintain low ultrafiltration rates (UFRs) at the high QB levels. The combination of pre-existing diffuse vascular disease, postdialysis hypovolemia, hypotension, decreased cardiac output, and increased blood viscosity has and will produce disastrous syndromes of organ ischemia, thrombosis, and infarction. Predialysis hypertension can worsen. Extreme caution and adjustment of dialysis regimen is necessary as patient Hct rises above 36%.\r"

This report examines the current perception threshold (CPT) test as a reliable alternative neurometric procedure to the NCT. The reliability of the CPT test was established in a one year longitudinal evaluation of 23 HD patients. CPT and NCT tests were performed on the median and peroneal nerves, bilaterally, with correlations of r = 0.83 for the initial determination and r = 0.80 one year later (P less than 0.001). CPT was shown to be a superior technique to NCT, as it is quick (tested during HD) and painless.\r"

Recently it has been suggested that monocytes that adhere to the dialysis membrane are also stimulated by endotoxins diffusing from the dialysate side. Stimulated monocytes, however, release interleukin-1, which mediates fever and hypotension through its action on the cyclo-oxygenase cascade. To prevent this endotoxin-induced stimulation of monocytes, a hemofilter with a polyamide membrane (FH 88, Gambro, Lund, Sweden, cut-off 20,000 daltons, surface area 2.0 m2) was interposed between the dialysate outlet of the HD machine and the dialyzer. The data obtained clearly show that the filtered dialysate was always pyrogen-free when tested with a limulus-amebocyte-lysate assay. In addition, in 80% of cases no bacteria were detected after the sterilizing filter. Almost no febrile episodes were observed when sterile dialysate was used.\r"

The bypass flow rates of the LVAD were kept at maximum levels (about 80% of total cardiac output) in four goats for 30 days, and at a limited flow rate (around 60%) in one goat each for 30 and 90 days. Morphometric studies using light and electron microscopy were performed on the left ventricles, comparing them to those in the four control studies. The results disclosed: 1) relative volume densities of the myocytes and interstitial tissue in the myocardium were unchanged; 2) cross-sectional areas of the myocytes in the maximum bypass cases were significantly reduced in comparison with pre-experimental data; 3) relative myocyte volumes, calculated by myocytes and nuclear volume densities, were reduced in three goats in the maximum bypass group; and 4) relative volume density of myofibrils was reduced in the maximum and 90 day bypass groups, whereas that of mitochondria was reduced only in the 90 day bypass case. These results indicate that LVADs cause cardiac atrophy which correlates with bypass flow rate and duration of assistance.\r"

To elicit determinants of survival, the authors reviewed records of 26 patients at our institution who required Pierce-Donachy VADs for PCCS. Thirteen patients were weaned from ventricular assistance (50%), nine (34.6%) achieved long-term survival, and 17 died. Survivors and those that died were equivalent in terms of age, sex, NYHA class, type of operation, and preoperative hemodynamics. Ventricular assist pumping was established earlier in survivors (P = 0.006) although aortic cross-clamp and total cardiopulmonary bypass times were equivalent between the groups. The development of biventricular failure was significantly associated with the inability to wean from mechanical circulatory assistance. Despite an equal incidence of biventricular failure, survivors had milder forms of this entity and all patients with severe biventricular failure requiring a biventricular assist device failed to wean and ultimately died (N = 5). Of all complications, inadequate cardiac output was a significant determinant of weaning. Perioperative myocardial infarction and renal failure were found to be univariate determinants of survival. Inadequate cardiac output and biventricular failure preclude weaning from mechanical circulatory assistance. Survival is associated with the expeditious establishment of assist pumping, and with the avoidance of irreversible perioperative myocardial injury and renal failure.\r"

Its pneumatic driver was gaited by the ECG to provide aortic diastolic augmentation, with a stroke volume of 60-70 ml. In the same animals a 20 ml intraaortic balloon (IAB) was placed into the descending aorta. An attempt was made to evaluate the effectiveness of the CD on severe cardiogenic shock and to compare its hemodynamic effects with those of the IABP. Severe cardiogenic shock was induced by coronary artery ligation, propranolol administration, and fluid infusion and was characterized by a LVEDP of 22.2 +/- 6.4 mmHg, ASP less than 70 mmHg and greater than or equal to 30 mmHg, and a reduction of CI by 71.7%. The CD had a significant beneficial effect in all measured parameters. The LVEDP decreased by a mean of 44.3% (P less than 0.001) below control value, and the AEDP by 60.2% (P less than 0.001). The PADA increased by 108.5% (P less than 0.001), and the CI by 155.8% (P less than 0.004). The IABP did not significantly change any of the hemodynamic variables. In conclusion, the CD has significant salutary hemodynamic effects in severe cardiogenic shock where IABP is ineffective.\r"

The effects of univentricular and biventricular support on septal shifting were compared. In 10 anesthetized pigs Thoratec left (LPV) and right prosthetic ventricles (RPV) were connected from the LV apex to the ascending aorta and the right atrium to the pulmonary artery, respectively. Each heart was instrumented with ultrasonic crystals for LV and RV free wall-to-septum dimensions, RV and LV pressures, and cardiac output (CO). LV and RV end-diastolic pressure and dimensions (EDD), and peak systolic pressures (PSP) and dimensions were analyzed on a computer under control conditions, and during EKG synchronized RPV, LPV, and biventricular (BPV) support. During LPV the septum shifted to the left, and during RPV it shifted to the right, with LVEDD and RVEDD changing in opposite directions under each condition. With BPV septal position changed in the same way as with LPV, although to a smaller degree. The amount of septal movement was linearly related to the change in transseptal gradient produced by the prosthetic ventricles. Each 10 mmHg decrease in left minus right transseptal pressure gradient resulted in a 22% reduction (r = 0.83) in LVEDD and a 27% increase (r = 0.87) in RVEDD at end-diastole, and a 2% reduction (r = 0.87) in LV dimensions and a 2% increase (r = 0.83) in RV dimensions at peak systole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This system consists of a UPC plasma-perfusion circuit (using a recirculation system) followed by a supplementary 0.8 L plasma exchange, using hemodialysis for the purpose of performing both removal and supplementary therapy at the same time. On average, approximately 40% of both bilirubin and bile acid are removed, with the osmolality gap reduced by 30%. This system is effective for prolongation of life in patients with chronic hepatic failure and those with acute hepatic failure that has become chronic. It can be considered an effective maintenance therapy for patients before liver transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "A miniature version of the electrocatalytic glucose sensor has been designed and fabricated with thick-film metalization technology. The in vitro stability tests of the sensor were performed in buffered saline, human plasma ultrafiltrate, and bovine plasma. For bovine plasma studies the sensor was directly coated with a semipermeable ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVAL) membrane. To stabilize the activity of the sensing platinum electrode, a fast-pulsing reactivation method was applied. Good performance of the continuously operating sensor was achieved in buffer (10% stability of the baseline current within 12 days) and human ultrafiltrate (10% stability of the baseline current and 5% stability of the sensitivity within 7 days). However, for measurements in plasma a slow degradation of the sensor's sensitivity (approximately 10% per day) was observed. These results indicate that when a proper screening membrane is provided the continuous glucose monitoring of body fluids with the miniature sensor is possible for at least 7 days.\r"

These implanted sensors are not externally polarized, but continuously consume oxygen and glucose and generate gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. On the average (sensors in 45 mice) the activity declines with time, almost vanishing by 600 days. However, the fact that some sensors retain nearly all of their activity for over 500 days indicates that glucose sensors can be made with a life span compatible with the requirements for an artificial pancreas (glucose sensor/insulin pump). Limited observation with similar implanted lactate sensors indicates their life span to be shorter.\r"

Plasma exchange was carried out 235 times in 23 patients and hemofiltration was performed 28 times for seven patients. In addition, hemodialysis and CAPD were linked in eight cases. Plasma exchange was found to control the progression of DIC and endotoxemia. Nine patients (35%) were weaned from EBPT. In the survivors the levels of blood ammonia and number of major complications were significantly lower compared to the nonsurvivors. Three patients treated only with hemofiltration were all lost. Among co-morbid factors present, incidences of renal failure, respiratory failure, and associated liver cirrhosis significantly increased poor clinical outcome on EBPT for postoperative liver failure.\r"

For preprandial dose supplements another arrangement is required. In this study a device consisting of a reservoir is assembled by attaching a 1 cm diameter foam ring to a 5 mm diameter piece of the same material. A 6 mg piece of compressed insulin is inserted into a cut between the ring and the attachment, along with 2 mg tetracycline to hinder microbial growth. The assembly is then enclosed between two membranes and an annular external wall. The top membrane is pierced once, and the device is tested by implantation under the abdominal skin of diabetic rats. Serous fluid will enter the interior through the orifice and leach the solid insulin that does not leak out. Daily sidewise compression over the skinfold of the unanesthetized animal indicated that the insulin supply lasted for 24 +/- 4 days. The blood glucose was consistently maintained at 3.4 +/- 1.1 mmol/L for 6-8 hr each day. After depletion the device can be refilled percutaneously by injecting insulin suspended in phosphate-buffered saline.\r"

Urine output was normal with elevation during the first 2 days in the 50 and 80% ET, followed by stable output by 2 weeks, ranging from 12 to 60 ml/kg/day. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) were normal. BUN/SCr was normal. The urine to plasma osmolality ratios were 2.6 to 8.3 (normal greater than 1), and fractional percent excretions of sodium (FES) were stable throughout. No existence of broad granular pigmented casts (BGPC) in urine sediment were noted. Renal histologic evaluation of vacuolization in the renal tubules were seen to be dose-dependent and transient, with normal histology by 3-6 months post ET. Dose-dependent vacuole formation observed in the early weeks post ET with PHP showed no renal functional changes.

A total of 12 sack type pumps were used in nine cases after operations for ischemic heart diseases (4 cases), valvular diseases (3 cases), and congenital anomalies (2 cases). Durations of pumping of each device ranged from 18 hours to 37 days (mean, 10.9 days). The clinical protocol for antithrombogenicity of the device indicates maintenance of ACT around 150 sec and keeping VAD flow more than 2.0 L/min. In our clinical series, however, heparin was given only in most cases to maintain activated clotting times (ACT) at 120-140 sec for the first three postoperative days. Minute ringlike thrombi were noted at connectors of cannula in two pumps after low flow (1.5 L/min) pumping for 5 days or after frequent on/off studies for weaning. A small thrombus (2 X 2 mm) and fine granular thrombi were noted on actuating bladders in two pumps that were used with frequent on/off studies or in a patient with severe sepsis during VAD pumping. Other VAD pumps were macroscopically free of thrombus. SEM analyses on surfaces of actuating bladders demonstrated mild to moderate platelet adhesions, which were correlated with platelet count, but not with other coagulation parameters including platelet agglutination and pumping duration. In cases with leucocytosis during VAD uses, leucocyte adhesion was noted as well without correlation to the coagulation parameters.\r"

The radiographic image obtained with BMIPP was compared with 201thallium chloride (TL) imaging, which indicates tissue perfusion. In the myocardial infarction (MI) model, the BMIPP and TL uptake were equally increased with the use of LVAD in the marginal area of the MI. In another model using the reperfused myocardium after ischemia, the BMIPP and TL uptake were increased in the reperfused area by LVAD pumping. On the other hand, BMIPP uptake in the residual myocardium of both models was decreased by LVAD pumping when compared with TL uptake. This discrepancy between these radiographic tracers in the residual myocardium suggests that tissue metabolic processes may be suppressed as result of a decrease in the energy demand by the myocardium caused by LVAD pumping. The results of this study showed that use of LVADs for the impaired heart improved cell function of \"stunned\" myocardium and also unloaded the excess work from the residual myocardium as judged by FFA metabolism.\r"

The s-AI levels increased by 2 days after the administration of DFO and then decreased by day 7 to almost baseline levels. No significant changes occurred in the RBC-AI levels until 1 month postinfusion, at which time the levels decreased slowly for the following month. Hb levels increased at 1 month postinfusion, suggesting that the changes in RBC-AI were independent of the changes in s-AI. Removal of AI by DFO may improve the anemia that accompanies diseases in which AI accumulates. DFO did not seem to transfer AI into the RBC or to remove the AI that had accumulated in these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Techniques of plasma filtration with rotating flat membranes are capable of producing a Taylor vortex and concomitantly reducing concentration polarization by formed elements. The present study describes filtration characteristics of a small-sized rotating filter that is superior to a capillary filter in terms of filtrate flux. The rotating filter with a surface area of 60 cm2 was composed of two concentric cylinders, with the inner cylinder mobile, with a flat polycarbonate membrane (pore diameter: 0.8 micron), and the outer cylinder fixed. Filtration experiments were performed using bovine blood to determine filtrate flux at rotational speeds from 600 to 4,500 rpm. Photographic observations using aluminum powder revealed that many Taylor vortices were present in the radial gap (0.6 mm). Filtrate flux increased with transmembrane pressure until a maximum filtrate flux of 0.02 cm/min at 600 rpm, 0.42 cm/min at 1,800 rpm, 0.60 cm/min at 3,600 rpm, and 0.69 cm/min at 4,500 rpm were reached at a blood flow rate of 100 ml/min. Based on the filtration resistance model, values for fractional filtration resistance of the red blood cell polarization layer ranged from 0.25 to 0.80 at a rotational speed of 3,600 rpm, whereas those of a capillary filter range from 0.80 to 0.90. This indicates that Taylor vortices promote back diffusion of red blood cells accumulated on membrane surfaces. Thus, the filtrate flux of a rotating filter is two orders of magnitude higher than that of a capillary filter because of the back diffusion of red blood cells facilitated by Taylor vortices.\r"

The graft implanted in the thoracic descending aorta grew slowly to the expected size within a year after implantation in puppies. Human saphenous vein was used as the substrate material. It was dipped into distilled water and sonicated, resulting in cell destruction, and followed by cross-linking with a polyepoxy compound to give both controlled biodegradability, hydrophilicity, and antithrombogenic properties. Four millimeter inner diameter (ID) grafts, enveloped with polyester mesh tubes of 10 mm ID, were implanted in 11 puppies. The diameter of the grafts grew to 9.5 mm from their original 4 mm. After 1 year, the graft walls that were reinforced with polyester mesh were covered with endothelial cells. The following requirements were provided in a growable graft: 1) antithrombogenicity in a small caliber graft; 2) ability to grow as well as to terminate growth. The polyester mesh tube, which was larger than the graft, caused arrest of growth at the expected diameter, whereas the growth rate was controlled by the degree of graft cross-linking. With this method, any size graft can be made by changing the size of the original graft and the polyester mesh tube around it.\r"

Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed by the examination and digitization of flow patterns. Inflow, outflow, pneumatic drive and after-load pressure, diaphragm motion, cardiac output, and heart rate were measured and recorded. An electrical circuit was developed to synchronize pump diaphragm motion with captured images of flow trajectories. Trajectories were then digitized, and velocities, turbulence, and shear stresses were calculated. As the result of these experiments, disturbed, recirculating, and stagnation zones were identified and global and local turbulence values were determined. Simultaneous turbulence, stasis, recirculation, and laminar flow patterns were observed during most phases of the pumping cycle. Velocities obtained varied from 2 cm/sec to 145 cm/sec; total local shear stresses of 12 to 897 dynes/cm2 were seen.\r"

The authors tested the hypothesis that alloying could affect the biocompatibility of the resultant membrane. Polymer films were cast from solutions containing 12% polysulfone and 4, 8, or 12% polyvinylpyrrolidone in dimethylacetamide. The effect of the films on the complement system and neutrophil function was assessed by incubating them in normal plasma and whole blood at 37 degrees C. Complement activation was followed by measuring plasma concentrations of C3a des Arg and C5a des Arg. Flow cytometric measurements of phagocytic capacity, H2O2 production, and expression of the C3bi receptor were used to assess neutrophil function. The degree of complement activation was found to depend on the composition of the polymer film. C3a des Arg and C5a des Arg generation decreased 75% and 86%, respectively, as the polyvinylpyrolidone content of the casting solution was increased from 25 to 50%. This was accompanied by a decrease in stimulation of neutrophil H2O2 production and C3bi receptor expression. From these data, the authors conclude that alloying with polyvinylpyrrolidone can affect the biocompatibility of polysulfone.\r"

Higher dialysate sodium has been used, but controversy exists concerning the increased incidence of high blood pressure (HBP), thirst, and weight gain. A double blind prospective study was carried out in five stable men on chronic hemodialysis. Dialysis was performed in random sequence with a dialysate sodium of 145, 150, or 155 mEq/L for 2 months at a time. Vital signs were monitored before, during, and after dialysis, and the presence of symptoms during and between dialyses was documented. There was a significant increase in interdialytic weight gain with increasing dialysate sodium: 145 mEq/L (2.2 kg), 150 mEq/L (2.6 kg), 155 mEq/L (2.9 kg). There was a small, nonsignificant increment in dry weight of 0.5 kg between a dialysate of 145 mEq/L to 155 mEq/L but no increase in the mean arterial blood pressure. There was no difference in the incidence of interdialytic or intradialytic symptoms, including cramps, nausea, or fatigue, nor any change in serum sodium or other routine laboratory data before dialysis. It is concluded that a high dialysate sodium is not associated with an increased incidence of hypertension, symptoms, or a change in serum sodium but is associated with an increase in interdialytic weight gain.\r"

  ".W": "The authors determined total body water (TBW) with tritium in 11 patients on chronic hemodialysis and compared this space to that estimated by 60% of body weight, and removal spaces of urea, creatinine, uric acid, and phosphate (PO4). The latter spaces were determined by dividing the total amount of substance (measured in total dialysate) by pre- minus post-dialysis concentrations. Body water X 0.6 was more than 10% less than the tritium space, and showed a maximal variation of 10 liters, or 24%. The removal space of urea was 80% of the tritium space, but correlated closely with it. The difference between total body water and urea removal space was variable and dependent on fluid excess (edema) in the patients. Creatinine, uric acid, and phosphate removal spaces were highly variable and not correlated to total body water. The authors suggest that actual measured TBW should be used, rather than estimations using BW X 0.6, for V in K X T/V, where K = clearance, T = duration of dialysis, and V = the removal space of urea. Furthermore, one may need to introduce a correction factor for urea removal space over TBW in the equation to allow better quantification of dialysis in edematous patients and during very fast dialyses.\r"

  ".W": "A hemofiltrate processor, which consists of a cultured monolayer of renal epithelial cells on a permeable membrane, displayed transport functions that mimicked the renal tubule. Two cell lines, LLC-PK1 (a proximal tubule-like cell) and MDCK (a distal tubule-like cell), were cultured on microporous cellulose nitrate membranes and studied in a diffusion chamber. Dual-label tracer experiments revealed that inulin, glucose, and para-aminohippurate (PAH) moved across unseeded membranes with similar rates in either direction. Solute concentrations in both compartments reached equilibrium in less than 12 hours. MDCK cell-covered membranes were impermeable to all three solutes, as expected from a distal tubule-like cell. LLC-PK1 cell-covered membranes were impermeable to inulin and PAH, but demonstrated a net apical to basal glucose flux of 150 to 350 ng/cm2/min, depending on the conditions. This led within 72 hours to a zero glucose concentration in the compartment on the apical side of the cells, versus 4.6 mg/ml on the basal side. This glucose transport function was inhibited by 0.5 mmol/L phlorizin. Highest glucose flux was obtained using extracellular matrix as the cell attachment substrate on the membrane, suggesting the highest degree of cell differentiation. Based on estimates of the surface area of the normal kidney, the glucose reabsorption capacity of the LLC-PK1 cell line was about 20% that of the normal tubule. The absence of PAH secretion may have been due to the heterogeneity of cells derived from the proximal tubule. Different cell types, culture conditions, and attachment substrates may enhance the transport capacity of the bioartificial renal tubule.\r"

Postoperative systemic and local effects of heat dissipation were studied in 5 thermally powered LVASs and 2 heated blood pumps implanted in calves, and compared with 10 pneumatically powered left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Postoperative mean temperatures of the heat dissipation group were as follows: 1. rectal (RT), 39.1 x 0.4 degrees C (NS versus control); 2. Lung interface, 41.6 +/- 0.6 degrees C (P less than 0.01 versus RT); 3. tissue interface, 40.2 +/- 1.2 degrees C (P less than 0.01 versus RT); and 4. blood, 39.2 +/- 0.8 degrees C (NS versus RT). There was no significant postoperative change in heart rate, respiratory rate, or rectal temperature between the two groups. No difference was shown between the two groups in hematologic parameters, plasma free hemoglobin, liver and renal function, fibrinogen levels, or coagulation processes at the same postoperative time. Heat dissipation to the pump-blood interface promoted a thinner neointima when compared with the nonheated surface. Angioneogenesis was observed in the tissue capsule adjacent to the heat dissipating surface. These results indicated that the thermal LVAS induced no deleterious local or systemic effects on recipient animals.\r"

  ".W": "Neutralization of heparin by protamine is a common procedure following extracorporeal circulation (cardiopulmonary bypass) of blood. Protamine administration has been shown to cause serious hemodynamic derangement in some patients. Obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed following protamine administration has been suggested to be the primary cause of hemodynamic changes. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that macromolecular complexes formed between cationic protamine with anionic heparin or other plasma components cause the obstruction of the vascular bed. An in vitro mock circulation model was designed to examine the formation of such complexes. In this model, blood or plasma was passed through a glass bead column at a constant flow rate while the pressure between the syringe pump and the column was closely monitored. No increase in pressure was noted when blood, plasma or saline alone or with added heparin were passed through the column. Addition of protamine to either blood or plasma resulted in a significant increase in the pressure; this increase was even greater when heparin was also present in the test medium. That the increase in pressure was due to the obstruction of the column was confirmed by using 1251-protamine and documenting that complexes formed between protamine and plasma proteins/heparin were retained in the column. These observations suggested that protamine formed large insoluble complexes with plasma proteins. Heparin appeared to help consolidate these complexes thus causing a rapid increase in the pressure. This may explain why the hemodynamic changes following protamine administration are more pronounced in patients with circulating heparin.\r"

  ".W": "Of the reasons to discontinue continuous implantable insulin pump therapy, flow rate reduction is the most common, occurring in 27 of 42 pumps in the University of Minnesota series. Thrombosis at the catheter tip appears to be a major reason for flow reduction. Six different procedures to restore flow in pumps were performed. Two of the procedures involve the infusion of an alkaline solution through the device, replacing the insulin/glycerol solution normally infused; the other four procedures are surgical ones involving manipulation of the catheter. In restoring flow the non-operative procedures achieved a success rate of 50%, having taken as long as 3 months to restore flow, and having allowed up to 1 year of further insulin pump therapy; flow in all the pumps so treated eventually decreased again. The operative procedures were nearly 100% successful, restored flow immediately, and allowed longer periods of adequate flow, but flow rate did again decrease. When flow rate reduction occurs further flow improvement procedures may be attempted without difficulty and are well tolerated. In implantable pumps the biocompatibility of the blood-catheter tip interface needs to be improved to deal with the recurrent problems of insulin infusion device flow rate decrease.\r"

The authors also have calculated and demonstrated the technical specifications required to provide laminar flow with Taylor Vortex formation throughout the device, as well as those required to retain constant shear stress on the blood components as viscosity changes. By maintaining constant shear stress below a critical level, it is possible to avoid shear induced hemolysis and to maintain maximal separation efficiency throughout the procedure. The device has further been designed to alter the filtration velocity along the membrane so that the critical filtration velocity is nowhere exceeded, i.e., concentration polarization effects are prevented.\r"

In this study, three different surfaces, Biomer (B), PEO-grafted Biomer (B-PEO) and heparin-immobilized Biomer with PEO spacers (B-PEO-Hep), were investigated, using a rabbit A-A shunt model. Occlusion times, at various flow rates (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 15.0 ml/min) were measured using surface modified tubings (1.5 mm ID, 30 cm length) inserted into rabbit carotid arteries. Platelet count, aggregability, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were measured with whole blood to observe systemic effects in ex vivo experiments. For Biomer and B-PEO, occlusion times were prolonged with an increasing flow rate, while platelet count and aggregability decreased. B-PEO showed prominent prolongation of occlusion time at flow rates over 5.0 ml/min with decreased platelet count and aggregability, indicating surface-induced platelet activation and systemic thromboembolization possibly caused by the presence of PEO. In contrast, B-PEO-Hep surfaces showed the longest and relatively flow-rate-independent occlusion times without detectable platelet activation. We concluded that the improved ex vivo blood compatibility of B-PEO-Hep, compared with Biomer and B-PEO, is due to the prevention of fibrin net formation by immobilized heparin, resulting in a reduction in fibrin related platelet aggregation and subsequent thrombus formation.\r"

The 2.5 mm diameter wire coil IVEP was torsion reduced to 1.4 mm, mounted on a modified balloon angioplasty catheter, and delivered into the MCL. Shape-memory conversion was activated thermally by injecting normal saline (3, 5, or 10 ml) at 45 degrees, 50 degrees, 55 degrees, 60 degrees, 65 degrees, or 70 degrees C, while the local temperature (Tp) at the endoprosthesis site was monitored by a thermocouple. Inconsistent completed conversions of the IVEP were produced by injecting 10 ml of 60 degrees C, or 5 ml of 65 degrees C normal saline, which raised the Tp to 45 degrees to 53 degrees C. Complete conversion of the IVEP to 2.5 mm was produced consistently by injecting 10 ml of 65 degrees C or 5 ml of 70 degrees C saline, which raised Tp to 55 degrees C for less than 1 sec. This moderate Tp (55 degrees C) for such a short duration was shown to be a reliable method for remote conversion of the IVEP after catheter delivery. Knowledge of the minimum temperature and volume for consistent, complete conversion of the IVEP has permitted simple, safe conversion during in vivo studies. Delivery after balloon angioplasty is envisioned to either treat acute dissection with occlusion or to prevent chronic restenosis, in order to further improve the safety and efficacy of balloon angioplasty procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Hemofiltration, or blood ultrafiltration, is a pressure-driven process used to remove waste solutes and excess water from blood in the treatment of kidney dysfunction. This convective process provides better removal of middle molecular weight solutes (1,000-20,000 MW) than hemodialysis, substantially reducing the incidence of hypotension. The ultrafiltration is performed using a cross-flow configuration in which blood flow is parallel to the filtering membrane and perpendicular to the filtrate flow. This configuration minimizes the accumulation of retained species at the membrane surface, significantly increasing filtration rates. Clinical hemofiltration is performed in two distinct modes: post-dilution, in which the fluid removed during filtration is replaced after blood leaves the filter, and pre-dilution, in which the replacement fluid is added to the blood before it enters the filter. Although post-dilution is used more commonly, the high hematocrit at the device outlet limits the maximum attainable flux and can contribute to cell damage. The lower inlet hematocrit and plasma protein concentration in pre-dilution leads to a marked increase in flux, potentially increasing the removal of waste solutes. There is, however, a concomitant increase in the amount of diluting fluid required and in the amount of fluid that must be removed during filtration. Existing models for hemofiltration are unable to explain the complicated dependence of the filtrate flux on shear rate, hematocrit, and plasma protein concentration. These models cannot be used to accurately compare the performance of different devices or of the two clinical modalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sieving coefficients were determined in an in vitro test circuit as a function of time, temperature, flow conditions, and plasma protein exposure. Sieving coefficients for albumin, gamma G immunoglobulin (IgG), and dextrans using normal human plasma as the test solution were comparable for dextrans and proteins of equivalent molecular size, independent of time after 15 min, lower at 8 degrees than at 37 degrees C, and higher at lower filtration flow rates. At 8 degrees C and high filtration flow rates, S for albumin and IgG also increased with increasing perfusate flow rate. Dextran S using a protein-free test solution before exposure to plasma were higher than those determined from plasma, and were independent of temperature. Dextran S from a protein-free test solution after exposure to plasma were similar to those determined from plasma at 37 degrees C, but higher than those determined from plasma at 8 degrees C. We conclude that sieving coefficients across plasma fractionating membranes can be altered by temperature due to changes in the process of membrane filtration. The present observations suggest that at low temperature a polarized layer or gel becomes a discriminating solute transport barrier.\r"

Since Ca++ is essential in immune-cell activation and lymphomonokine production, the authors analyzed the effects of intraperitoneal (IP) verapamil therapy in 16 CAPD patients with UF loss. The areas studied included: 1) PLy and PM0 Ca++ concentration, 2) peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) lymphomonokine levels, 3) peritoneal glucose absorption, 4) UF volume, and 5) peritoneal morphology. In the 10 low UF patients who showed normal glucose absorption and increased peritoneal fibroblast proliferation, of verapamil therapy increased UF volume, decreased the amount of peritoneal fibroblast proliferation, and normalized the previously high PLy and PM0 Ca++ concentrations and PDE lymphomonokine levels. Conversely, UF was not improved by IP verapamil in the six low UF patients showing high glucose absorption and prevalent mesothelial alterations. In conclusion, IP verapamil can be considered a suitable therapy for increasing UF volume in CAPD patients with peritoneal hypopermeability due to a lymphomonokine-mediated hyperproliferation of peritoneal fibroblasts.\r"

Recently, it was postulated that chronic overstimulation of peritoneal macrophages (PM) may result in fibrosis and loss of ultrafiltration. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether alternative osmotic agents (polyglucose, amino acids, glycerol, bicarbonate/glucose, gelatine, hydroxyethyl starch) provoke greater eicosanoid release by PMs than glucose. Fifty milliliters of sterile dialysate containing different osmotic agents were injected intraperitoneally into nonuremic guinea pigs. After 4 hours of dwell time, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production was analyzed in peritoneal effluents using specific radioimmunoassays (RIA) after liquid extraction. Cyclooxygenase products were generated with all osmotic agents: PGE2 concentrations ranged from 0.9 to 2.8 ng/4h, and TXB2 levels ranged from 39 to 49 ng/4h. In addition, the lipoxygenase product LTB4 was found in concentrations between 1.8 and 3.5 ng/4h. There were no significant differences in eicosanoid release among the osmotic agents. Thus, in this experimental setting, the capacity of PM to release inflammatory mediators did not correlate with the chemical composition of the dialysis solutions.\r"

The studies were repeated, when possible, every 6 months after peritonitis episodes. The results were divided according to osmolality of solutions and dwell time. The age of patients had no influence on results. Significantly positive correlations were found between PC (1.36%) of creatinine, uric acid, phosphate, and time on CAPD. Uric acid PC (3.86%) correlated directly with time on CAPD. The PC in diabetic and nondiabetic patients were similar. Patients who had more than three episodes of peritonitis showed PC similar to those observed in patients who had less than three episodes, despite a longer time on CAPD. The stability of PC in patients undergoing long-term peritoneal dialysis suggests that CAPD may permit effective dialysis over many years.\r"

The 7 mm diameter transvalvular inlet cannula of the cable driven pump receives blood from the left ventricle. The pump then discharges blood into the descending aorta. In the calf, the pump was introduced into the renal aorta. Safety and effectiveness of the device were demonstrated in three control and 21 implanted animals. Blood chemistry results showed an average plasma free hemoglobin of 3 mg/dl for control and 6.7 mg/dl for implanted animals. Platelets were 1.04 X 10(6) and 0.65 X 10(6), respectively, for control and implanted animals. Fibrinogen, BUN, creatinine, and bilirubin were essentially the same for both groups of animals. The hardware was typically free of deposits, and histopathologic examination revealed minimal injury to intracardiac structures, aortic valve leaflets, and aortic intima. The data indicates that the device may provide full support for a failing left ventricle with minimal trauma or risk.\r"

All implantee's were Category 6 (Urgent Need) patients, exhibiting functional Class IV symptoms or facing imminent death, in the judgment of their physician prior to obtaining a suitable cardiac allograft. Sixty-three of these patients, (68%) were transplanted. Of the 56 transplants 35 (56%) patients are currently alive, with most returning home and back to work. Implant duration ranged from 1 to 243 days of support, with an average of 24 days. Implantee average age was 42 years, with a range of 15-60 years. Male/female distribution was 80/12, with the females requiring longer periods of pump support and exhibiting lower survival rates. Several main implant categories have surfaced during the study, with the collective disease category of cardiomyopathy constituting 66% of the study population. This broad category may be subdivided into ischemic cardiomyopathy 52%, idiopathic 25%, viral 7%, and miscellaneous 16%. Acute rejection of donor organ (17%) and unweanable patients (11%) constitute the other major implant categories. Postoperative complications observed in a population cohort of 70 patients include bleeding in 44%, infection in 34%, reoperation in 27%, neurologic dysfunction in 13%, and device failure in none. Standardized device explant analysis results indicate a trend in thrombus reduction concurrent with increased investigator experience and improved patient management techniques. The concept of bridging in a specific group of patients in which the prognosis is otherwise hopeless continues to demonstrate therapeutic value.\r"

A novel approach has been developed eliminating the need for repeated arterial cannulation. The arterial access system (AAS) consists of a 7 Fr Silastic catheter, which is threaded into the internal mammary artery, and an attached access well, which is placed in the subcutaneous tissue over the sixth rib. The AAS is implanted during the initial operation. The access well is punctured percutaneously with a 23 gauge needle to obtain arterial blood or to measure arterial pressure, and patency is maintained by flushing the access well with 2,000 U of heparin each week. The AAS was implanted in six calves (three with a total artificial heart, three with a ventricular assist device) for a mean duration of 124 days (range, 20-323 days). There were no infections related to the AAS, and none of them thrombosed. All of the AAS had excellent arterial wave forms when punctured. The AAS is simple to implant, provides reliable long-term arterial access, and does not appear to increase the risk of infection.\r"

  ".W": "Missing the moment for application of ventricular assist devices (VAD) may be one of the major causes of multiple organ failure in patients who are to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with the aid of VAD. To determine the optimal timing for application of VAD in such patients, we examined the effect of a CPB assist on cardiac functional recovery from severe global ischemia using an experimental canine system. In the present study we created myocardial ischemia by clamping the aorta for 20 minutes (Group I; N = 7) or 45 minutes (Group II; N = 11) under normothermic CPB. The reliability of the method in creating severe cardiac failure was confirmed by testing the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate (CP), and lactate. After reperfusion of the myocardium, the heart was assisted by a totally vented CPB. The left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Emax), which is a load-independent index of contractility, was obtained every 15 minutes for up to 120 minutes of reperfusion. The Emax revealed that the function of the damaged heart recovers exponentially with time after reperfusion. From curves of the functional recovery of the heart, CPB support appeared to be beneficial for the first 60 minutes after reperfusion, and aided in the recovery of cardiac function in hearts damaged by global myocardial ischemia. However, CPB assist thereafter may not be effective in further improving cardiac function. We therefore concluded that the decision to use VAD should be determined by cardiac function by 60 minutes of reperfusion to avoid prolonging CPB time.\r"

The systems, which are continuously monitored, are diurnally cycled between two output levels by automatically varying preload and afterload. Currently, 14.3 years of failure-free operation have been accumulated, with a mean duration of 14 months. Using an exponential failure distribution model, the mean time to failure (MTTF) is greater than 8.8 years, corresponding to a demonstrated reliability (for a 2 year mission time) of 80% (80% confidence level). Recent ovine experiments with VAS subsystems include a 767 day volume compensator implant, a 279 day pump/drive unit implant and a 1,448 day BST implant. The last 12 chronic pump/drive unit experiments had a mean duration of 153 days (excluding early postoperative complications).

As the simple intrinsic control method does not significantly increase cardiac output (CO), this study attempted to develop a new TAH control method that increases the CO during exercise in a manner similar to a natural heart (NH) by predicting changes in CO as a time function (TF) at various treadmill speeds. The control method for TAH was as follows: 1) an arbitrary grade of treadmill exercise was loaded onto the TAH goat; 2) a TF at this grade of treadmill exercise was determined from the physical activity rate (PAR) measurement, defined as the time average of the increase in vertical acceleration of the body; 3) operating parameters of both pumps were controlled in accordance with the TF using the computer algorithm. With the predictive control method changes in CO in the TAH were almost the same as in the NH, whereas no increase in CO occurred with the fixed control method (FC), in which operating parameters remained unchanged during exercise. Changes in blood lactate and catecholamines tended to be less than with the FC.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report that total cardiopulmonary bypass (CPBP) for severe heart failure can be safely maintained for several days through peripheral cannulation alone. In two healthy sheep under general anesthesia, the authors cannulated the right external jugular vein and the right subclavian artery. A special spring was attached to a 7F Swan-Ganz catheter and positioned at the level of the pulmonary artery (PA) valve, rendering it partially incompetent. The extracorporeal circuit included a venous reservoir, a roller pump, a membrane lung, and a blood pulsator set at 25 beats/min. Ventricular fibrillation was induced with 110 VAC. Extracorporeal blood flow was raised to 100-120 ml/kg min. Mechanical pulmonary ventilation was changed to 5% CO2 in room air. During bypass, the wedge pressure (WP) averaged 9-13 mmHg, PA pressure 7-13 mmHg, and central venous pressure 1-9 mmHg. After 38 and 48 hr respectively the hearts were defibrillated with DC shock. There was total heart failure with no ejection from right or left. We continued with TCPBP. The right heart recovered after 1 and 3 hr respectively. After 7 and 5 hr, respectively, there was some aortic ejection. By 11 and 4 hr, respectively, the sheep were off bypass and on room air, with return to baseline cardiac function. Throughout the recovery the WP averaged 4-8 mmHg. At autopsy, all hearts were soft and normal in appearance. Histologic examination of the lungs and the heart was unremarkable. The authors conclude that the PA spring readily decompressed the LV. Ventilating lungs with 5% CO2 in air during CPBP sustained excellent lung function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In conjunction with engineering and physiologic requirements, anatomic fit is a fundamental problem that must be carefully addressed in the design of a truly feasible implantable total circulatory support system. To facilitate the conceptualization, a three-dimensional anatomic model of an average adult thorax was developed from a data bank of 14 human cadavers, 100 radiographs, 18 computerized tomographs, 4 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies, and 31 cineangiograms. The location and orientation of the valves, the atrial chambers, venae cavae, and pulmonary hili were found to be the most critical information. As a result, configuration of a one piece, completely implantable total artificial heart (E4T system) with the hydraulic actuator placed between the two ventricles was defined and sized to provide an output of 8 L/min at 120 beats/min. The device was designed to be positioned through a midsternotomy similar to the natural ventricles (in the pericardial sac toward the left chest cavity), and the ports were carefully designed to eliminate the risk of compression of critical cardiovascular structures. Validation of the design was conducted with an E4T model implanted in three human adult cadavers, two of which were submitted to NMR imaging after the device was implanted and the incision closed. Excellent fit was observed in all cadavers, and analysis of the several sagittal, transverse, and coronal NMR images showed no compression of the natural internal structures.\r"

This was 1.3 days after the average intact device was removed. Women were three times more likely to sustain rupture than men (4 vs. 1.3%, P less than 0.05). Rupturing IABs were characterized by a greater magnitude of diastolic augmentation than intact IABs, 69.4 +/- 24.9 vs. 25.5 +/- 12.6 Torr (P = 0.01). A hypertensive treatment history was more prevalent in patients rupturing (83 vs. 41%) (P less than 0.05). Rupture was diagnosed by finding blood in the safety chamber in all patients. There was no gas embolization nor did any patient become infected. Ruptured devices showed abrasion wear in the most distal portion of the IAB, where the aorta is smallest. In vitro testing with CO2 showed no driving gas loss but withdrawal of the surrounding fluid into the IAB system. Ruptured IAB replacement in four patients was associated with three survivors. In four patients the device was not replaced and two patients survived. There were no complications as a consequence of IAB rupture (all values +/- SD).\r"

The hemolysis index (HI), defined as grams of hemoglobin released per 100 L pumped, was calculated from a curve fit to the hourly data. Each pump was tested five times. The mean HI obtained ranged from 0.0467 for the roller pump to 0.0076 for the Biopump BP-80. There was no statistically significant difference among the three centrifugal pumps tested.\r"

Urea clearances were measured and found to approximate the dialysate inflow rate, Qd, up to about 15 ml/min. At higher dialysate flow rates, equilibration was incomplete so that urea clearance was 24.7 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SE) ml/min when Qd was 30 ml/min.

The study was done in a transparent flow model fabricated from a femoral-to-femoral arteriovenous loop graft (AVLG) surgically implanted in dogs. The 6 mm x 25 cm loop graft reproduces that of the brachial artery-cephalic vein hemodialysis angioaccess loop graft commonly used in patients. At a pulse rate of 70 beats/min and blood flow of 0.7 L/min, flow visualization was done using a 15 mW He-Ne laser and a cylindrical lens system which converts the incident laser beam into a thin parallel light plane. Hydrogen bubble technique was used to illustrate the flow field at selected planes. Phasic pressure and flow oscillations were observed in the hypertensive host vein. The pressure wave arrived at the venous anastomosis with higher amplitude and shorter time of travel in the Gore-Tex graft than in the Ultraflex graft. The differences in wave attenuations and wave transmission time between grafts resulted in apparent changes of flow pattern in both the proximal (heart side) and distal (foot side) veins. The negative lags between the flow peaks in the distal vein and proximal artery are explained by the phasic pressure gradients measured at the anastomoses. Spectral analysis was done on the venous thrills, which are characteristic of almost all clinical AVLG implants. The power spectra taken at 60, 70, 90, and 120 beats/min clearly demonstrated a concentration of fluctuation energy at about 100 Hz in the Gore-Tex AVLG.\r"

These patients are often hospitalized in intensive care units where the use of a sorbent regeneration dialysis system is convenient. In this study, the use of regional citrate anticoagulation during dialysis with a cuprophan dialyzer on a REDY dialysis machine was investigated in eight patients. The white blood cell count, arterial PO2, arterial and venous ammonia, and arterial, venous and dialysate aluminum were measured. Similar studies were carried out on four other patients undergoing dialysis with standard systemic heparin anticoagulation and cellulose acetate dialyzers. The white blood cell count was observed to decline moderately, reaching a nadir of 83.2% of control at 15 minutes. The PO2 was unchanged or increased. However, blood ammonia rose in four of five patients, with the venous value always exceeding the arterial value. In two patients, aluminum levels in blood increased as well, and in one patient, a marked increase was observed in dialysate, and venous and arterial blood, with the concentrations being highest in the dialysate. No such changes were observed in the patients anticoagulated with heparin. It was concluded that although citrate is a useful agent for regional anticoagulation, it should not be used in sorbent regeneration systems.\r"

The wall of this prosthesis consists of a microporous polyurethane-siloxane copolymer reinforced with a polyester network. It displays compliance (13.2 x 10(-4) mmHg-1) comparable to native arteries, is nonkinkable (minimum radius of curvature = 5 mm), burst resistant, and easily suturable. Using a lining procedure, coverage of prostheses by ENC was in excess of 95%. The ENC populations were found to be highly pure (by factor VIII-related antigen, DilAcLDL uptake) and to produce about 0.3 ng prostacyclin per cm2. In vitro tests of shear stress resistance demonstrated that ENC monolayers on the new elastic prosthesis remain intact for 3 hr in physiologically pulsating culture medium (Vmax = 50 cm/sec). Lined prostheses implanted for 24 hours in mongrel dogs as an arteriovenous shunt demonstrated the antithrombogenicity of the cultured ENC. The results suggest that small-diameter vascular prostheses which are compliant, porous, and actively antithrombogenic are feasible.\r"

We clarified these problems in animal experiments and developed a new cardiac wall substitute to overcome them. As one of the best cardiac wall substitutes obtainable at present, glutaraldehyde-treated equine pericardium (Xenomedica, GA-graft), was sutured as a patch in the right ventricular outflow tract (Group 1: 16 dogs). A new cardiac wall substitute, which is composed of collagen-coated polyester mesh (CUFP), was sutured in the same fashion (Group 2: 19 dogs). The problems clarified in the GA graft were insufficient antithrombogenicity and poor healing of the neointima and the graft wall. The CUFP had sufficient antithrombogenicity and good healing quality as a cardiac wall substitute. CUFP should be rapidly infiltrated by host cells, to become a kind of host organ and therefore not degenerate with long-term use.\r"

Explanted hearts were examined grossly and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy for accumulation of thrombus and ingrowth of pseudoneointima. Visible material was essentially limited to inflow and outflow valves, atrial cuff, and a circumferential band of white thrombus around the junction of the blood diaphragm with the housing. The band was barely visible at 33 days, but was 1 to 3 mm wide at 128 days. SEM examination revealed microscopic deposits of blood elements, mostly platelets, that were present between 10 days and 128 days. The deposits were rather uniformly distributed over the blood contacting surface and remained constant over time. At 128 days, the Dacron (Meadox Medical, Oakland, NJ) graft was partly covered by a thin layer of tissue composed of multiple layers of cells separated by collagen. New blood vessels were frequently found, but fibrin-rich thrombus was present in some areas. Thus, this system was capable of minimizing thrombus accumulation and remained stable for 4 months.\r"

In this paper, the principle surface molecular design and highly selective adsorptional behaviors of anaphyatoxin-scavenging materials were demonstrated. Both C3a and C5a are highly basic proteins, whereas most plasma proteins are negatively charged in blood. This indicates that negatively charged surfaces could preferentially adsorb these basic proteins from plasma. Based on the above working hypothesis, surface molecular designs aiming at incorporation of negatively charged groups such as carboxylate and sulfonate groups on surfaces were attempted. The control of surface density at the outermost layer was assessed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The designed surfaces preferentially adsorbed C3a and C5a from activated serum. This provides a rational basis for the extracorporeal anaphylatoxin-scavenging device under development.\r"

A vinyl-methyl silicone co-monomer was hydroxylated via an oxymercuration-demercuration reaction and then film-coated on a silicone rubber sheet. C16 acylation of the -OH coated sheet was carried out by an esterification reaction catalyzed by 4-DMAP. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of -OH groups following the hydroxylation reaction, and (CH2)n groups following the acylation reaction. 125I-labeled albumin binding studies indicated graded enhancements, according to reagent concentration, with maximal 2.7X and 2.5X increases for 20% -OH coated and 20% -OH/C16 acylated surfaces, respectively. Incubation with a protein denaturant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), removed 73% of adsorbed albumin from unmodified controls, with only 25 and 34% removal from 20% -OH coated and 20% -OH/C16 acylated surfaces, respectively. These results suggest that -OH and C16 modified surfaces not only preferentially adsorb albumin, but also retain it in a more stable configuration; this is an unexpected finding for -OH modified surfaces. Based on similar albumin affinities for biocompatible C18 alkylated and C16 acylated polyether polyurethanes, the authors expect significant improvements in thromboresistance and complement-activating potential for this modified silicone rubber.\r"

The in vivo effect of membrane contact on oxygen radical production and chemotaxis of dialyzed neutrophils isolated simultaneously from the arterial and venous sites during dialysis with cuprophane, polycarbonate, polysulfone, and polyacrilonitrile membranes was studied. Cells remaining in circulation after 15 min of dialysis showed defective responses only when collected at the venous site of the cuprophane dialyzer, in spite of a similar leukopenia at the venous and arterial sites. With the other membranes tested, no defects in neutrophil functions were evidenced. These results suggest that down-regulation occurs within the dialyzer and that, besides complement activation, the membrane plays an additional role.\r"

In order to develop an effective method for the control of thrombosis in extracorporeal circulation, it is important to perform a quantitative evaluation of random samples of all the circuit elements. In an effort to quantify thrombosis in experimental extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits, random samples of silicone rubber membrane and polyvinyl chloride tubing were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantitative morphometry. The results indicate no statistically significant differences in the amounts of various adhered blood components between the tubing and the membrane. Greater than 60% of the examined surface had no blood components present. Platelet adhesion on the surface was predominant. Evidence of fibrin, gross thrombi, red cells, and white cells in small quantities were noted. It is concluded that quantitative scanning electron microscopy (QSEM) not only provides accurate information about the morphologic changes of blood cells due to surface contact, but also quantifies the individual elements and therefore assesses their contributions to thrombosis. This quantitative description will allow more meaningful comparison of blood-compatible materials and surfaces.\r"

Cells were labelled in a postconfluent state with tritiated thymidine, harvested, and a cell suspension seeded into a 4 mm PTFE graft. After a 90 minute incubation period, one half of the graft segment was sacrificed and the remaining portion placed in a perfusion system (225 cc/min) for 1 hour. Graft segments, effluents, and seeding suspension were assayed in a beta scintillation counter. The percentage of cells that attached pre- and postperfusion were determined, as well as the retrieval of tritium from the system. Initially, 71% of seeded cells attached to grafts coated with fibronectin, with significantly less (60%) remaining attached after perfusion. Only 10% of cells initially attached to uncoated grafts, with 4% retained postperfusion. Retrieval of tritium averaged 102 +/- 10% for all experiments. This system determines both pre- and postperfusion attachment of human endothelial cells to vascular grafts following manipulation of numerous variables, including graft material, substrate, incubation time, and seeding density. An optimal seeding protocol for human trials can thus be determined.\r"

Hemoperfusion with coated activated charcoal (CAC) produces low removal rates due to the strong binding of bilirubin to albumin. Biocompatible chemical agents were investigated to selectively unbind the bilirubin into solution just prior to CAC exposure. In batch mock solution tests, the addition of sodium benzoate resulted in a 69% equilibrium bilirubin removal at 50 mM and 96% removal at 100 mM. During flow tests, adsorptive removal of sodium benzoate was so rapid that the CAC had to be pretreated with sodium benzoate solutions. In the absence of sodium benzoate, the outlet bilirubin was 50% of the inlet concentration at the passage of one void volume, with a rapid increase to 70% (30% removal). With sodium benzoate at 100 mM, the same 50% outlet/inlet percent was observed at one void volume throughput, but the outlet concentration fell to 6% of the inlet at 12 column void volumes (94% removal). Similar experiments with bovine plasma/blood and human plasma resulted in an average increase in bilirubin removal of 25% for the bovine and human plasma and 35% for the bovine blood at 100 mM benzoate. A significant decrease in platelet aggregation was measured with the addition of sodium benzoate, which makes this augmented hemoperfusion removal of bilirubin clinically attractive.\r"

Polyamide, polysulfone, and polyacrylonitrile membrane hemofilters were placed in a gravity-driven in vitro CAVH apparatus. Distilled and deionized water or saline was used to perfuse the hemofilters. A biphasic pattern of permeability decay was seen in all hemofilter types. A large exponential decline in permeability occurred over the first 1 to 6 hours, with a more gradual decay thereafter. Of all membranes studied, polysulfone hemofilters were the most permeable upon initiation of use but showed the most pronounced early and late permeability decay. Both polyamide and polyacrylonitrile hemofilters showed little permeability decay after a brief exponential decay. These data suggest that early membrane hydraulic permeability decay may not be primarily due to membrane protein coating. Initial high permeability may place some CAVH systems at risk for hemofilter plugging.\r"

  ".W": "Backfiltration in hemodialysis refers to local filtration of dialysate into the blood compartment. This investigation was performed to examine whether there is a similar backfiltration phenomenon in membrane plasma separation. It was shown experimentally in hollow fiber devices that there is a flow of plasma through the filtrate side parallel to the blood flow inside the fiber. This bypass flow includes a backfiltration of the plasma from filtrate to the blood compartment near the end of the module. The following experimental results show the existence of bypass flow and backfiltration. In the case of no net filtration, these findings were made: 1) the existence of an offset of mean transmembrane pressure and 2) the blood side pressure drop in ACD-blood was less in impermeable fibers than in permeable ones. Filtrate pressure is higher than module outlet pressure at a wide range of filtration rates. In summary, backfiltration is not restricted to zero net filtration but occurs under the conditions of clinical use. Therefore, backfiltration is a crucial issue for device safety, because any contamination or wash-out from the membrane can reach the blood side.\r"

  ".W": "Change in the electrical charge of leukocyte surface membranes during hemodialysis (HD) using a cellulose membrane was studied by examining adsorbability of leukocytes taken from patients undergoing HD to cation and anion exchange resins. Leukocytes of HD patients were well adsorbed to both anion and cation exchange resins, whereas normal leukocytes were only minimally adsorbed to a cation exchange resin, suggesting that the surface membranes of normal leukocytes were charged electronegatively. Adsorbability to anion exchange resin by patients' leukocytes taken from the venous limb of the HD circuit line 15 minutes after starting HD was significantly decreased when using a cellulosic membrane. This suggests that the decrease in electronegative leukocyte surface membrane charge, which may facilitate the attachment of leukocytes to electronegatively charged endothelial cell membranes, is the factor leading to leukopenia. Adsorbability to anion exchange resin by normal leukocytes incubated with plasma taken from HD patients 10 to 60 minutes after starting HD was increased, suggesting an increase in electronegatively charged substances in patients' plasma; these recombine with leukocyte surface membranes thereby increasing the electronegative charges of the leukocyte surface membranes and enabling subsequent release of leukocytes from endothelial cells, consistent with the transient nature of the leukopenia.\r"

  ".W": "A new system for ultrafiltration control during hemodialysis is described. The apparatus consists of a computer operated system of load cells that register variations in weight of the outlet dialysate versus inlet dialysate. Once the weight loss of the patient has been established, the gravimetric control operates on the dialysate circuit to obtain the transmembrane pressure adequate to achieve the desired ultrafiltration rate and patient weight loss. The system can be used as a complete dialysis machine or as a separate module that can be adapted to any standard dialysis machine. This module was tested in more than 220 dialysis sessions, using different membranes and ultrafiltration rates. The difference between the scheduled and the real weight loss was always less than 100 g at the end of the dialysis session. The number of technical interventions required were few, as was the rate of complications related to the system. The system is safe and reliable and offers a low cost opportunity to improve dialysis tolerance by accurate and progressive ultrafiltration during the session.\r"

A 55-year-old patient who developed intractable ascites about 6 months after starting CHD was studied. The premise was that osmotic disequilibrium during HD may be the causative factor. Other causes of ascites were excluded. The study method relied on determining simultaneous serum and ascites osmolality (Sosm and Aosm) at the start and finish of a standard 4 hour HD session. The results: Sosm and Aosm at the start averaged 310 and 309 mosm/L, respectively. At the end, Sosm averaged 285 and Aosm averaged 301 mosm/L, giving a 16 mosm concentration gradient. Two days later, Sosm and Aosm were equal again. It is concluded that the osmotic gradient at the end of 4 hours of HD favors movement of water from the intravascular space into the ascitic fluid space until osmotic equilibrium is once again achieved.\r"

Presented here is a simplified approach to therapy prescription monitoring that is based on the full-fledged urea kinetic model. A Kt/V-PCR domain map (K: clearance, t: time and V: volume of urea distribution; PCR: protein catabolic rate) has been developed with the predialysis urea nitrogen concentration on the abscissa and the post/pre dialysis urea concentration ratio on the ordinate. On this domain map, the therapy index Kt/V is represented by a family of horizontal lines and the PCR is represented by a family of curved lines. In this simplified approach, mid-week measurements of the pre (C1) and post (C2) dialysis urea nitrogen concentrations are plotted on the domain map. The position of the plotted point allows one to read off the Kt/V index and the PCR to determine whether therapy index, diet, or both need to be modified.\r"

A transcellular fluid shift from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment may aggravate this depletion. Continuous recording of blood volume during dialysis would be beneficial in detecting hypovolemia at an early stage. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an electrical conductivity method in detecting hypovolemia and changes in red cell volume. Blood and plasma conductivities were measured, as was hematocrit. Erythrocytes were counted and blood and plasma volume changes were calculated from reciprocal erythrocyte counts. Blood and plasma conductivities were substituted into an equation to calculate hematocrit. Red cell volume (MCV) was calculated from hematocrit and erythrocyte counts. The MCV decreased 3%, and calculated hematocrit corresponded very well with measured hematocrit. Blood and plasma volume decreased by 13.5 and 17.5%, respectively. In summary, it was possible to estimate hematocrit by the conductivity method. The MCV did not change significantly. This method offers the possibility of measuring blood volume on-line.\r"

The study was carried out in 11 patients in two sequential dialysis sessions, utilizing the same high surface area hollow fiber dialyzers, after a 2 day interdialytic period. With short HD, as expected, the clearance (Cl) of BUN, creatinine (Cr), and phosphates (P) was significantly higher than in standard HD:Cl BUN = 331 vs. 225, Cl Cr = 286 vs. 193, and Cl P = 231 vs. 176 ml/min. No significant difference in the total BUN extraction (measured on the total amount of exhausted dialysate) was found between the two techniques. As to Cr and P, despite higher Cl in short HD, the total extractions were significantly lower. In conclusion, in the evaluation of short HD efficiency, instantaneous Cl can be adequate for small molecules, while for larger solutes, other parameters, such as total extraction, must be considered.\r"

The incorporation of a very small amount of dermatan sulfate was sufficient to enhance adhesion and growth of endothelial cells and to suppress platelet adhesion and activation.\r"

Seven catheters functioned an average of 75 +/- SE 19 days (range 24-117). One catheter remains functional after 176 days. Infection and thrombosis were the main reasons for failure. 20 plasmaphoresis experiments were carried out in four heparinized rabbits (blood flow rates 15 ml/min, plasmaflux 1.5-2.0 ml/min) using polypropylene minifilters (average pore size, 0.55 micron) with the plasma recirculated back into the animal. No hemolysis was detectable throughout the 4 hr experiment. Plasma proteins with a MW of 69 X 10(3) to 3 X 10(6) (Albumin, LDH, SGOT, SGPT, CPK, fibrinogen, LDL) showed a sieving coefficient close to 1.0. The good filtration performance and the absence of side effects make this system a possible use for plasmaphoresis in neonates.\r"

  ".W": "A small-caliber vascular graft with good healing properties was developed using an autologous connective tissue tube (ACTT) and in situ heparinization. ACTT is the best material for implantable grafts, but as a small-caliber vascular graft, both the high thrombogenicity and requirement for time to preparation in situ were serious problems. To overcome these difficulties, an ultrafine polyester fiber (UFPF) mesh was used for the framework of the graft. it has been shown that UFPF provides a good framework for fibroblast migration and proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. The granulomatous connective tissue tube could be constructed very rapidly and had numerous capillary blood vessels, which opened onto the luminal surface of the graft when it was implanted as a vascular substitute and provided colonies of endothelial cells. These colonies spread rapidly all over the luminal surface, and the graft developed permanent antithrombogenicity by endothelialization. The next problem was attainment of temporary antithrombogenicity of the graft before complete endothelialization. Since collagen fibrils are highly thrombogenic, the fact that ACTT collagen fibrils face the luminal surface requires greater antithrombogenicity. A new technique for binding heparin to collagen fibrils in situ was also developed. This was proved to be useful in maintaining the antithrombogenicity of the grafts (3 mm in inner diameter, 6 to 7 cm in length) in the animal studies. The graft showed rapid healing of the neonintima with endothelialization and long-term stability of the graft wall.\r"

To see whether emptying could be voluntarily controlled, ileal and jejunal reservoirs were constructed in eight dogs under general anesthesia. Four pairs of stainless steel electrodes were attached to the serosa at 5 cm intervals, and the pouches were intubated for pressure measurements with 1.67 mm polyethylene catheters. All lines were brought subcutaneously to the neck where they were maintained under a protective jacket. One to four weeks later, the pouches were stimulated with trains of square wave pulses at frequencies between 3 Hz and 1.67 KHz. The pouches were injected with contrast, and the results were monitored by fluoroscopy. Intrapouch pressure increases as high as 80 mmHg were seen after stimulation at 3 Hz, 100 msec and 6 Hz, 50 msec (10 to 25 mA) and emptying was induced. Pressure increases were also seen after stimulation with 330 Hz, 1 msec and 10 Hz, 1 msec pulse trains, but emptying was not documented. Abdominal wall contraction during stimulation was a problem but could be inhibited by interposing an insulating silastic sheet. The conclusion was made that it is possible to electrically induce emptying of intestinal reservoirs in a chronic dog model.\r"

  ".W": "Bilateral vocal cord paralysis can result in inspiratory difficulty, while stroke can impair swallowing and be followed by severe aspiration. Ideally, these mutually exclusive functions must be rehabilitated dynamically. The principle of the artificial reflex arc (ARA) entails appropriate pick-up information, which is then sent to a modulator that in turn synchronously stimulates the impaired effector. In vocal cord paralysis (six dogs), respiratory information has been picked up via tracheal strain gauges and transthoracic impedance electrodes, producing an analog voltage proportional to respective changes during inspiration. A trigger and a stimulator circuit were used to drive an electrode placed around a nerve-muscle pedicle previously implanted into the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. Two msec square waves with 1.8 V amplitude and 50 Hz frequency resulted in frank vocal cord abduction synchronous with inspiratory flow. Conversely, vocal fold closure can be paced from information originating from strain gauges placed on the hypopharynx (four dogs). Stretch stimulating deglutition resulted in controlled output of a constant current stimulator driving an electrode passed around both recurrent laryngeal nerves. An adjustable stimulus from 0 to 20 mA at 25 Hz produced tetanic closure of the vocal folds. This might offer promise for electronic control of the transplanted larynx.\r"

A pure culture of thymic epithelial cells, identified as such by transmission electron microscopy and keratin staining, was obtained by low temperature organ culture of fetal mouse thymus. These cells remained intact and produced physiologic amounts of the thymic hormone thymosin alpha-1 after encapsulation in a permselective polymer membrane and in vitro culture for 5 days. An encapsulated implant of thymic epithelial cells may therefore promote reconstitution of an immune system in immunodeficiency diseases without allowing the rejection or destruction of the thymic tissue.\r"

Four months after implantation, the membrane was absorbed and the wound surface was covered with mesothelial cells. In general, deposition of fibrin on a wound surface leads to the formation of fibrous adhesions. Therefore, heparin, which inhibits the precipitation of fibrin, is effective in preventing these adhesions. Human amnion was cross-linked with a polyepoxy compound after the impregnation of protamine sulfate into its collagen matrix and was heparinized. Nine adult mongrel dogs were used, five for the heparinized experiment and four as controls. In each animal, two 5 X 5 cm2 areas of the serosa were peeled from the large intestine. The exposed areas were covered with the membrane. The membrane showed an excellent antiadhesion effect in both areas in all five dogs (10 areas). In controls, no membrane was used. The greater omentum, uterus or urinary bladder adhered in five of eight areas. An antiadhesion membrane for soft tissue must not interfere with wound healing as well as prevent adhesions.\r"

With PX valves, the maximum and mean assist durations were 161 and 54 days, respectively, in the calf and 279 and 129 days, respectively, in the sheep. The maximum and mean durations for BP valves were 93 and 38 days (calf) and 153 and 69 days (sheep). In bovine studies with PX valves, severe obstructive pseudoneointimal (PNI) proliferation in the Dacron inflow conduit was the primary cause for termination; valves exhibited moderate calcification. With BP valves, both PNI proliferation and severe valve calcification contributed to a declining pump output, leading to termination. In contrast to the bovine experience, PNI proliferation was not observed in ovine implants. BP valves still became calcified, as evidenced by a progressive decline in pump output (from about twelve weeks) and confirmed at termination. Valve calcification was minimal with the PX valves, even at 236 days. These results favor the adult ovine animal model for extended implants.\r"

Moreover, hypotension during AHD may occur as a result of rapid shifts in intravascular volume. From January 1987 to March 1988, we treated nine selected VAD patients who had hypervolemia and acute renal failure with a simplified hemofiltration technique. A continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) cartridge was connected from the outflow circuit of a centrifugal blood pump to a large-bore central venous catheter. With CAVH, gradual removal of 272 cc/hour of ultrafiltrate was accomplished for periods up to 241 hours. No episodes of hypotension, thromboembolism, or other deleterious effects occurred. In our series, the CAVH technique was effective in treating hypervolemia in selected VAD patients.\r"

An LVAD was implanted between the left atrium and the descending aorta of goats. The LVAD was pumped in a counterpulsation mode and at maximum bypass flow for 4-6 weeks in chronic experiments. The following results were obtained: 1) LVAD pumping itself did not affect RV function, even after 6 weeks of pumping, 2) the dimensions of the RV free-wall segments measured by sonomicrometers showed a gradual and small increase during the early postoperative days, which was due to an increase in volume returned to the RV and the deformity of the RV cavity derived from reduction in LV volume, and 3) the same tendencies were seen even with LV failure hearts. These results suggested that 1) LVADs can assist not only the LV but also the RV by reducing RV afterload, 2) excessive and prolonged assistance by an LVAD seems to dilate the RV free-wall, and 3) preexisting RV dysfunction is the main cause of signs of RV failure during LV pumping.\r"

  ".W": "To define more efficient use of biomechanical circulatory assistance, the contracting and fatigue characteristics of normal and conditioned latissimus dorsi of seven adult mongrel dogs were analyzed. The conditioned muscles underwent vascular adaptation and electrical stimulation with burst frequency of 50 Hz in rates of 60 and 120 contractions per minute for 6 to 8 weeks. They were compared with unconditioned contralateral controls by isometric force measurements. Normal and transformed muscles exhibited the same optimum pacing parameters (burst frequencies from 50 Hz up and train durations from 150 msec) with supramaximal amplitude stimulation. Conditioned muscles showed initial smaller forces (-27%) and longer contraction times (+32%). Fatigue curves of unconditioned muscles for different duty cycles showed marked initial decreases and proportional stable values of force after some minutes, with equal final tension time indexes under these conditions (20 +/- 3 KgF seg/min 100 g). Conditioned muscles maintained stable force for same duty cycles and a greater tension time index during prolonged conditions (68 +/- 6 KgF seg/min 100 g). This study revealed that normal and conditioned skeletal muscles are capable of maintaining steady state work depending upon their aerobic capacity and suggests that these muscles may undergo adaptive transformation while contracting in a synchronous fashion with the heart during variable duty cycles.\r"

  ".U": "89062171\r", 
  ".W": "An electromagnetic pneumatic pump driver has been developed with the goals of enhanced mechanical reliability and simplicity of operation. The new driver eliminates failure prone components such as solenoid valves or pressure regulators common to conventional pneumatic drive systems, has only a single moving part, and provides for closed-loop operation in which stroke volume and dP/dT are controlled on each beat in real time. Power is provided by a high force (178 N) electromagnetic linear actuator. This assembly uses a high energy density neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnet, low loss vanadium alloy pole pieces, and an energized moving coil. The nominal stroke length of the actuator is 1.7 cm. During operation, the moving coil always remains within a fixed annular air gap, resulting in a measured force output versus applied power linearity of better than 92% over its stroke range. The coil is directly attached to the free end of a 10 cm diameter, 21 convolution, welded titanium metal bellows that forms the gas containing element of the system. The comparatively low pressure gradients across the bellows in this application result in a predicted life for the bellows in excess of 10(9) cycles. Bellows position and internal pressure are monitored continuously to control the pneumatic output. The linear actuator total excursion and velocity are adjusted on each beat using a closed-loop servo system. This results in a pump driver with no operator required adjustment of drive pressure. Instead, there are user selected settings of stroke volume, operating mode, and fill sensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bjork-Shiley and Hall valves used in most artificial heart blood pumps have often induced problems, which include 1) An expensive valve must be used even when the AH is used for only a few days, 2) Ring thrombus was often formed at the interface between the valve ring and blood pump, seamless fabrication was not possible, and 3) Mechanical failure often occurred. To improve these circumstances, a new jellyfish valve was designed and manufactured. The valve has a simple structure: The center of a thin circular polyurethane membrane is fixed on a polyurethane base plate, which has many holes or slits to reduce flow resistance and help hold the membrane during the diastolic phase. In a mock circulation study, the valve displayed performance similar to the Bjork-Shiley valve. A small amount of regurgitant flow was observed at valve closure, in comparison with the Bjork-Shiley valve. It was recognized in the flow visualization study that the central region of the membrane was washed out well by the flapping of the membrane. This jellyfish valve is promising for use in a AH blood pump.\r"

Although many investigators claim that contact with agarose induces significant blood damage, we find that the biocompatibility of immobilized agarose is significantly improved when a novel system is used to fluidize the particles within the bioreactor vessel. We have built a prototype device that is oscillated vigorously about the axis of fluid flow. This action produces secondary flow patterns within the vessel that suspend the particles. In our model system, the bioreactor contains agarose immobilized heparinase. The system is biocompatible for 2 hours in vitro (in human blood at 37 degrees C) as follows: 1) hematocrit, white cell, and platelet counts do not change, 2) levels of plasma hemoglobin increase to 15-34 mg/dl, and 3) levels of complement component C3a increase to 0.64-1.4 micrograms/cc. We hope these studies lead to the development of a heparin removal system that can improve the safety of a variety of extracorporeal procedures. In addition, the techniques and approach used are sufficiently general to permit their extension to any immobilized species bioreactor for blood detoxification.\r"

A mathematical model was used in the development of the Sarns/3M SMO oxygenator, as presented at the 1985 ASAIO meeting. This model accepts inlet saturation, hemoglobin levels, and other variables, and returns output saturation, and has been verified in over 100 clinical cases. A patient oxygen consumption model including oxygen stores was developed, using clinical data based on size, temperature, and a term called \"anesthesia level.\" This interesting factor accounts for differences between institutions. The two models were integrated with a heat exchanger model and a patient temperature model to allow accurate predictions of cooling and heating, and a hemoconcentrator model. The combination was programmed for IBM compatible computers to create a bypass simulator. A potential user can put a patient on bypass starting with any selected patient variables, track progress on a minute by minute basis, and adjust the circuit variables as dictated by his technique. The program runs in accelerated time, and accepts defaults to continue without changes as long as desired. Such a simulator is valuable for the initial introduction of the new device to experienced perfusionists, the training of potential new perfusionists, study of unusual or complex cases, the design of new devices, and even as a \"track along\" system during an actual clinical case.\r"

  ".U": "89062176\r", 
  ".W": "Heparin employed in extracorporeal circuits often leads to hemorrhagic complications. Protamine employed for heparin neutralization can cause adverse hemodynamic responses. To control both types of complications, the authors propose an approach that consists of placing a filter device containing immobilized protamine (defined as a protamine filter) at the termination of the extracorporeal blood circulation (ECBC) procedure. This protamine filter would remove heparin from the extracorporeal circuit before heparin is returned to the patient. Meanwhile, the filter would also permit external protamine treatment. Since protamine toxicity generally results from the interaction of protamine with certain cells present in the liver, lungs, and tissues, the use of external protamine would minimize its potential adverse effects. Protamine was immobilized on a hollow fiber bundle obtained from a conventional hemodialyzer. Preliminary studies show that the protamine bound bundle is capable of neutralizing the anticoagulant activity of heparin both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the protamine filter has abolished the hypotensive response normally associated with protamine reversal of heparin, as indicated by the insignificant changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, pulmonary artery systolic/diastolic pressures, and cardiac output. Further in vivo studies involving the use of dogs, as well as investigation of the activation of the complement system by the protamine filter, are currently being conducted.\r"

Coralline hydroxyapatite (HA) was coated with a thin film of polylactide (PLa), maintaining pore structural characteristics. Cylindrical plugs (3 x 7 mm) implanted in non-load-bearing femoral and tibial diaphyses of the rabbit indicated substantial bone ingrowth at 3 weeks, with no significant difference between coated and uncoated HA in the amount and distribution of new bone. PLa-epsilon caprolactone polymeric negative replicas of coral Goniopora (G), inserted into the rabbit femur for 4 wks, showed newly formed bone grown deeply into the pores. Tight attachment of new bone to the implant and minimal inflammatory response suggested an osteocompatible reaction. In order to maintain the desirable pore structure of G while introducing controllable degradation rate and mechanical properties, a novel technique was employed to replicate G with PLa and its co-polymers. An intermediary negative replica of G was prepared with aspirin. A co-polymer positive replica of G was then prepared by solution or melt infusion into the negative replica; the aspirin was removed by methanol. A macro- (300-500 microns) and microporous (5-15 microns) structure was prepared by freeze-drying. This replica received appreciable bone ingrowth when implanted in the rabbit tibia for 3 wks. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of creating devices with interconnected pore structures and controlled porosity, elasticity, and mechanical strength sufficient for articular cartilage application, osteocompatibility, and controlled degradation rate.\r"

The authors evaluated the effects of a new cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor (DN-9693) on leukocyte aggregation in vitro, utilizing canine heparinized blood and pulmonary leukocyte sequestration during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in dogs. On in vitro evaluation, DN-9693 inhibited the leukocyte aggregation response to leukotriene B4 in a dose response manner; the aggregation response elicited by contact with a membrane lung was inhibited by a 50% inhibition dose of approximately 0.2 mumol/L. Leukocyte kinetics were assessed in a venovenous bypass system with a silicone hollow fiber membrane lung. The control group (n = 6) without DN-9693 developed a reduction in the arterial leukocyte count of 55 +/- 17% at 2 minutes of ECC. The transpulmonary difference in leukocyte count (pulmonary artery count minus systemic artery count) was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) from -175 +/- 206/microliters at baseline to 1225 +/- 330/microliters after 2 minutes of ECC. In the DN-group (n = 4, DN-9693; 60-80 micrograms/kg/min), there was no significant reduction in the arterial leukocyte count during ECC, and the transpulmonary difference showed no significant increases (75 +/- 386/microliters; baseline, versus 125 +/- 263/microliters; 2 minutes of ECC). These results suggest that DN-9693 inhibits the aggregation of leukocytes in the presence of blood-material interaction in vitro, and also prevents pulmonary leukocyte sequestration induced by ECC, with attenuation of systemic leukocyte depletion.\r"

During 5 months time, 96 on-line HDF treatments were performed in five chronic uremic patients. We found the infusion fluid and dialysate containing bicarbonate free from bacteria and endotoxins, with a correct weight balance obtained by the monitoring system.

A unique method is presented that uses a fluid dynamic approach to improve patency. A large diameter graft (5-6 mm ID) is used with an arteriovenous (AV) shunt to create a high flow rate (350-650 ml/min); a Venturi flow resistance controls the AV shunt and provides high pressure to the coronary arteries. The resulting graft can supply as many coronary arteries as required by means of side to side anastomoses upstream from the Venturi resistance. The concept was studied in a mock circulation system to analyze fluid dynamics under pulsatile flow. Mathematical models were used to study laminar and turbulent shear stresses and flow distributions over the physiologic range of Reynolds numbers. In vitro testing demonstrated little bovine red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis (0.249 mg Hb/min) compared with other devices. In vivo testing in sheep showed no significant acute changes in pulse rate or blood pressure in response to the shunt. The fluid and mathematical modeling of this concept has additional application in the study of flow past stenoses.\r"

Pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene (PHP), developed from human RBC hemoglobin (Hb) by chemical modification as an oxygen carrier, was evaluated in vitro for its ability to reverse cell sickling. PHP solutions of 6 or 8 g % Hb and a P50 of 20 mmHg were evaluated. RBC were obtained from SCD patients treated by exchange transfusion. The in vitro positive pressure filtration method (47 mm 5 microns Nuclepore membrane) was used. Comparisons of PHP with low oxygen carrier solutions (Hespan, saline) were made at flows of 0.43 to 6.0 ml/min. PO2 increases in a 20% mixture of air saturated solutions with deoxygenated sickle cell suspensions (SCS), at a hematocrit of 1%, were significantly higher in PHP as compared with saline and Hespan. The filtration resistance of deoxygenated SCS mixed with PHP was significantly lower than that of deoxygenated SCS mixed with saline and Hespan, and was comparable to that of air oxygenated SCS. By the 20% (v/v) addition of air saturated PHP to deoxygenated SCS, 89 +/- 2% of the sickled cells were unsickled. A novel artificial capillary system (ACS) modeling the dynamics of the microcirculation of the body was used. With the ACS plugged with deoxygenated cells, perfusion with oxygenated cell-PHP solutions was significantly more efficient in reversing the blockage than oxygenated saline and Hespan solutions. PHP reverses cell sickling by its effective delivery of oxygen.\r"

At selected intervals, the diastolic and pulse volumes of the grafts were measured and compliance calculated. These studies demonstrated that this vascular prosthesis had a high initial compliance, independent of graft diameter. During dynamic loading, diastolic volume increased whereas pulse volume and compliance decreased 12%, 43%, and 49%, respectively (P less than 0.001). Greater than 75% of the changes occurred within 5 days after the onset of testing. Despite these changes, isocompliance was demonstrated for the BioPolyMeric grafts following 22 days of cycling, yielding values similar to those reported for human saphenous vein.\r"

The current study describes a novel determination of dialysate flow by x-ray computed tomography. The authors did steady and nonsteady state tracer experiments with adipiodone to observe the dialysate flow pattern in capillary dialyzers held vertically and horizontally. The hollow fibers were filled with paraffin to avoid permeation of adipiodone from the dialysate to blood compartment. In steady state tracer experiments, adipiodone solution (50 vol%) was injected into the dialysate compartment at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Horizontal sectional dialysate flow patterns were observed every 2 cm from the point of the adipiodone injection. Adipiodone solution flowed along broken and twisted fiber bundles at dialysate flow rates ranging from 200 to 600 ml/min. In nonsteady state tracer experiments, dialysate was switched from pure water to adipiodone solution by solenoid-controlled valves after a steady state was reached, and adipiodone solution (2.4 vol%) was infused into the dialysate compartment for 30 sec at a flow rate of 500 ml/min. Vertical sectional dialysate flow patterns were observed every 2 sec after the start of adipiodone infusion. Values for dialysate flow velocity at the outer and inner regions of the fiber bundle were 3.5 and 0.6 cm/sec for the CA-170, and 1.4 and 0.7 cm/sec for the HF-200 capillary dialyzer, respectively. This study demonstrates the usefulness of x-ray computed tomography in visually and quantitatively determining dialysate flow patterns in capillary dialyzers.\r"

A number of independent process variables allow control of characteristics of the conduits: gas and polymer solution feed rates, nozzle traverse speed, nonsolvent (water) flow rate, spray-mandrel spacing, and mandrel rpm. The SEM reveals that the graft wall consists of numerous fused polymeric fibers arrayed in both the circumferential and axial directions. The inner surface resembles a mesh of closely spaced fused fibers. The conduits have walls with interconnected pores (water permeabilities between 0.05 to 7.0 ml/min-cm2); nonporous surfaces also can be made. Tensile stress of the grafts at failure (in radial direction) varied between 0.05 to 2.3 MPa, whereas elongation at break ranged between 150 to 600%, depending on the porosity and fabrication conditions. A major advantage of this technique is its ability to produce grafts of a wide variety of fiber sizes and fusion characteristics in an inexpensive, safe, and reliable fashion.\r"

The measurement errors in [Hb] and OS are 0.5 g% and 1.2%, respectively, over an hematocrit range of 25 to 45%. The oxygen content derived from the optical sensor yielded a standard error of 0.1 to 0.2 vol%. The sensors were mounted in the outflow ports of left and right artificial hearts that maintained the entire circulation and were used to chronically monitor arterial and mixed venous [Hb] and OS. In combination with pump output and pressure measurements, oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption of the animal was derived on-line using a microprocessor. In the experiment that lasted 40 days, both sensors functioned well, with stable measurements, and no thrombus formation around the sensor at the time of autopsy. The optical sensors are useful for monitoring cardiopulmonary function and metabolic status of patients without requiring blood samples. In addition, the pump output may be controlled through the level of mixed venous OS or in combination with the arterial OS.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility of using the synthetic tetrapeptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, RGDS), which was recently identified as the common cell attachment site of adhesive plasma proteins, for platelet preservation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was investigated. The synthetic RGDS inhibited platelet aggregation and adhesion and secretion of thromboxane A2 in a dose-dependent manner, due to antagonistic inhibition via ligand-receptor interaction. Platelet consumption during CPB was drastically reduced by the administration of RGDS with no remarkable change in hemodynamics and a fairly rapid recovery of platelet functions. Electron microscopic observation revealed that this platelet-preserving effect of RGDS resulted from the inhibition of adhesion and aggregation on the artificial surface. These strongly indicate that the cell attachment site of adhesive plasma proteins plays an important role in platelet consumption during CPB. The synthetic RGDS acting as an antagonist of the platelet membrane receptor, is a novel platelet-preserving agent, especially useful when using an extracorporeal circuit with a large blood-material contact area, such as CPB.\r"

To eliminate these we used an 0.8 m2 Capiox II hollow-fiber oxygenator ventilated with warmed humidified oxygen and a Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump with a 1/4 inch head at a flow of 250 cc/min in six sheep during 96 hr of ECMO each. Oxygenator performance and plasma Hgb were determined, as were the volume, electrolyte, and protein content of fluid accumulating in the gas phase of the oxygenator. Mean oxygen transfer was 15.78 +/- 3.15 ml/min, and mean differences in PaO2 between blood entering and leaving the oxygenator was 360 +/- 49 mmHg. Mean plasma Hgb was 24.7 +/- 12.8 mg/dl. Fluid in the gas phase of the oxygenator was less than 75 ml/day and contained no albumin, protein, sodium, potassium, or chloride. Centrifugal pumps have been associated with hemolysis at low flows, but this may have been due to the simultaneous use of silastic membrane oxygenators that have high resistance. Hollow-fiber oxygenators have been associated with early failure of gas exchange and fluid accumulation in the gas phase. This may have been due to ventilation with dry gas. We conclude that a hollow-fiber oxygenator and a centrifugal pump can provide excellent gas exchange, acceptable hemolysis, and little fluid loss.\r"

The analyzer consists of a wider frequency microphone, a digital signal processor with multiple bandpass filters, and displays. To quantify the high frequency component in section pattern of opening and closing clicks, maximal frequency at -30 dB level was used at a diagnostic parameter (normalized maximal frequency, NMF). A total of 17 thrombosed valves with or without pannus formations have been experienced and SSA showed abnormality in 13 valves, which comprised of Bjork-Shiley (N = 6), Starr-Edwards 2320, 6120, 6520 (N = 5) and Kay-Shiley (N = 2). The abnormal findings included NMF of opening or closing clicks lower than normal range of each type of prosthesis, and significant decrease of NMF more than 450 Hz from the value previously obtained. All diagnoses of thrombus formations and their locations were confirmed by operative or autopsy findings. The SSA failed to diagnose in four valves, which comprised of Starr-Edwards 6520 (N = 3) and Bjork-Shiley (N = 1). Operative findings revealed that thrombi were formed in a manner that permitted direct collision of disc and valvular ring causing clicks with high frequency component. No pseudo-positive diagnosis for thrombosed valve was experienced in the authors series, and SSA is thought to be a reliable noninvasive technique that enables early diagnosis of a thrombosed valve.\r"

Therefore, a new valve type devoid of these problems would be a major step forward. In order to evaluate a new valve design made by dipmolding with different PU materials, an animal test series was carried out in which two valves from each material were implanted into the mitral position of growing Jersey calves. The surgical procedure and postoperative catheterization data are presented. The survival times ranged between 127 and 291 days. Organs and explanted valves were examined post mortem according to general pathology standards. Specifically, the valves were histologically examined for calcium deposits and investigated by light microscopy, REM and EDAX. All explanted valves showed calcification and immobilization, but the results suggest that at least two PU materials attain survival times which are far beyond the lifetime of bioprostheses under the same implant conditions, justifying further in vivo studies in adult animals.\r"

The HVPs studied were the 25 mm St. Jude Medical (SJM) and the 25 mm Carbomedics (CMI) in the aortic position and the 27 mm SJM and 27 mm CMI in the mitral position. All data were collected at a heart rate of 70 beats/min and a cardiac output of 5.0 L/min. Flow visualization was conducted in the transparent flow chambers of the pulsatile mock circulatory flow loop using a 15 mW He-Ne laser light source. A cylindrical lens and optics system converted the incident laser beam into a thin parallel light plane, and 420 microns tracer particles were suspended in the testing fluid to illuminate the flow field at selected planes. Frame-by-frame analysis of the 16 mm high-speed cine provides detailed phasic flow patterns in the vicinity of the HVP. A series of still photographs of flow patterns, taken at approximately 22.5 degrees phase intervals, are sequentially presented for each HVP. In the aortic position, a Karman-like vortex pattern appears downstream of the SJM at the end of the ejection phase. The CMI exhibits a rather symmetrical ejection flow pattern that turns into random motion immediately after the onset of ejection. In the mitral position, the SJM again exhibits a strong core flow during ventricular filling, whereas the CMI produces a more diffuse pattern during the same period. A pair of vortices shed from both the SJM and CMI are clearly visible toward the end of the ventricular filling phase. The vortex mechanisms are discussed in light of leaflet boundary layer formation.\r"

Data were analyzed using an IBM PC-AT. Valve area (cm2) was determined using Gorlin's formula (AG) and a new formula for instantaneous area derived mathematically and using a theoretic constant. AG, mean (AI) and peak (Apk) instantaneous areas were compared to geometric measures of area (Aactual) in vitro. Peak instantaneous area correlates best with measured area. Intraoperative assessment using the ultrasonic flow probe and computer analysis is helpful in understanding the dynamic properties of prosthetic valves in vivo.\r"

At 2 and 3 weeks post implantation, grafts were removed, revealing 9 of 11 autologous and 8 of 11 nonautologous seeded conduits to be patent. Linings were harvested enzymatically and grown in tissue culture, with karyotype analysis limited to cultures that exhibited greater than or equal to 50% endothelium (n5 autologous, n7 nonautologous). Sex type was classified in 20 cells from each graft. All five autologous cell-seeded grafts revealed host cells. Among the seven nonautologous cell-seeded grafts, one harbored only non-autologous cells, three revealed only autologous cells, and three exhibited a predominance of autologous cells with lesser numbers of nonautologous endothelium. All 100 cells from the autologous-seeded grafts were the same sex as seeded cells, while only 28 of the 140 cells from the nonautologous seeded grafts were the same sex as seeded cells (P less than 0.001). Thus, nonautologous endothelial cell seeding with immunosuppression did not uniformly produce nonautologous cell linings, but was more often associated with autologous endothelial cell linings that may have been promoted by the nonautologous cell seeding.\r"

For samples of either whole blood or suspensions of either ghosts or red blood cells in platelet rich plasma undergoing low-stress simple shear flow, data on hemoglobin and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) released from red blood cells, single platelet reduction (which is a measure of platelet adhesion to nonbiological surfaces and platelet aggregation in the bulk) and percent of surface covered with platelets and platelet aggregates were obtained in a cone-and-plate viscometer for shear rates up to 5680 s-1. The results obtained suggest that red blood cells release a significant fraction of their ADP (2% at 5680 s-1), which is enough to induce platelet aggregation, and contribute about 65% to the total ADP release for a sheared blood sample; ADP released from red blood cells contributes about 60% to single platelet reduction and about 28% to platelet adhesion, whereas ADP from platelets contributes about 8% and 14%, respectively; and the physical effect of red blood cells, which is coupled to the chemical effect, acts to catalyze (enhance) the chemical effects. Based on the results obtained a mechanism was developed to describe both the chemical and physical nature of the red blood cell effect.\r"

A significant increase in platelet deposition was noted not only at the suture line, but proximal and distal to it as well. The results were different for each of the sutures employed and suggest that the suture line may influence early platelet deposition in the perianastomotic region, not only at the suture line, but proximally and distally as well.\r"

The uptake of Indium-111 platelets was monitored continuously by gamma camera scanning. Several of the materials tested demonstrated a saw-toothed pattern of platelet activity, with accumulation followed by rapid decline. Neither PTFE nor Dacron exhibited this pattern. Post shunt scans of the animals' chests showed discrete foci of platelet activity in the lungs, corresponding to each embolic event noted on the material's scan. In conclusion, the search for a smooth surface as a blood material interface may produce a material which accumulates and then sloughs significant platelet aggregates. It is crucial that these materials be subjected to vigorous testing to determine their safety prior to initiation of clinical trials.\r"

The authors have developed and evaluated alternative textured surfaces to the polyester velour surface that has been used on those devices. These new textured surfaces are fabricated with materials known to provoke a diminished tissue response compared with polyester fibers. Two new textured surfaces have been examined: a surface composed of extruded 25 micron diameter polyurethane fibrils (PF) woven into a fabric, and an integrally textured silicone rubber surface (TS) with nonfibril geometry applicable to silicone rubber implants such as mammary prostheses. In both cases, tissue fixation to the textured surface depends primarily on mechanical interdigitation with the complicated surface morphology of the implant rather than on chemical bonding. Two types of control were employed: polyester velour fabric (PV) as a textured surface, and smooth silicone rubber (SS). Each surface was first characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and test specimens consisting of 1 cm diameter by 1 mm thickness disks were then prepared and implanted subcutaneously in a series of 16 adult New Zealand white rabbits. After 8 weeks the samples were explanted and histologic sections prepared for analysis. In all cases a thin, organized tissue capsule surrounded the implant. While the tissue capsule on average was thinner surrounding the textured surface implants, variations in the individual host response were more significant. Tissue attachment was minimal with SS, present with PF, and greatest with TS and PV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intravenous (IV) administration of a single dose of recombinant murine TNF-alpha (10(5) U per mouse) significantly suppressed normal and leukemic late-stage erythropoiesis as measured by numbers of mature erythroid colony forming cells (CFU-E) in the bone marrow and spleen and by peripheral blood reticulocyte counts. In normal animals, the immature erythroid (BFU-E), macrophage (CFU-M), and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) compartments were significantly stimulated by TNF-alpha in both the bone marrow and the spleen. In the bone marrow of leukemic mice, the BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-M progenitor cell compartments were also stimulated by treatment with the monokine. In the spleens of leukemic mice (the primary site of FV leukemia cell accumulation), relative numbers of BFU-E and CFU-GM were increased by TNF-alpha, while those of CFU-M were suppressed. TNF-alpha caused a rapid decrease in the markedly elevated spleen weights of progressively leukemic mice, and in multiple doses it caused complete clinical disease regression in a significant percentage of leukemic animals. The combination of TNF-alpha with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) increased the incidence of leukemia regression, compared with TNF-alpha alone. These results show that TNF-alpha exerts a suppressive influence on late-stage erythropoiesis in vivo and suggest that this effect might be exploited in the treatment of acute erythroleukemia, erythroid hyperplasias, and related diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cyclosporine A (CyA) on the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to infect the H-9 T-cell leukemic line, as well as interleukin-2 (IL-2)-grown human peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes, has been studied. Pretreatment of H-9 cells and human lymphocytes with CyA over 24 hours completely prevented viral infection over a 21-day period, whereas the addition of drug at two hours postinfection with HIV-1 had a significant inhibitory effect on viral replication and expression of the virus-specific antigens p17 and p24. However, if CyA was added at later times to these lymphocytic cells, this inhibitory effect was lost. Indeed, the removal of CyA from cultures that had been treated from two hours after infection led to the rapid production of progeny virus. HIV-1 was able to infect peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from each of four kidney allograft recipients on long-term CyA antirejection therapy, as long as drug was not included in the culture medium. In addition, we asked what effect pretreatment with CyA of cells of the U-937 monocytic line and primary cultures of human monocytes/macrophages might have on infection by HIV-1. CyA had no demonstrable effect on the ability of HIV-1 to infect cells of either type.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody (designated alpha BFX-2b) prepared against bovine factor X inhibited factor X activity in human, bovine, porcine, rabbit, and canine plasma. In assays using purified prothrombinase components, factor Xa, factor Va, phospholipid vesicles, and calcium ion with the fluorescent active site thrombin inhibitor dansylarginyl-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide, the antibody inhibited the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Antibody alpha BFX-2b also blocked prothrombinase cleavage of the macromolecular substrates prethrombin 1 and prethrombin 2 but did not inhibit factor Xa hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide. The antibody also prevented the inactivation of factor Xa by antithrombin III but did not prevent the inactivation by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Antibody alpha BFX-2b bound factor Xa with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and an apparent dissociation constant of 9.0 x 10(-11) mol/L as estimated from its inhibition of prothrombinase activity. Antibody alpha BFX-2b did not prevent binding of factor Xa to factor Va-phospholipid as measured by using fluorescence polarization or high-pressure liquid gel chromatography with the fluorescent Factor Xa analogue dansyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-Xa. Immunoblotting of factor X following electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels and transfer to nitrocellulose indicated that the antigenic determinant recognized by antibody alpha BFX-2b was found on the heavy chain of factors X and Xa. From these observations it can be concluded that antibody alpha BFX-2b recognizes a highly conserved epitope on the factor X heavy chain that is remote from the topographic sites required for prothrombinase complex assembly and substrate hydrolysis but may be located at or near a portion of the macromolecular substrate binding site.\r"

  ".W": "We examined 91 specimens (from 87 patients) for the expression of B-cell- and T-cell-associated differentiation antigens and rearrangements of the Ig and beta-chain of the T-cell (beta-TCR) genes. Of these, 74 were representative of various histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and related disorders, 11 of Hodgkin's disease, and 6 of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. An Ig gene clonal rearrangement correlated to a monotypic (kappa/lambda) phenotype in 32 of 33 histologically defined lymphoma samples. The genotypic analysis also confirmed clonality in six of seven malignant diffuse lymphomas that were nonmonotypic but expressed pan-B antigens; in four, more than one clone was detected within individual tumors. A beta-TCR clonal rearrangement was found in 19 of 19 tumor samples considered as malignant T-cell lymphoma on the basis of histopathology and of the CD3-positive phenotype of tumoral cells, and in two cases of CD3-positive lymphomatoid disorders. A loss of pan-T antigens (CD7, CD5, CD2, CD4/CD8) was observed in all but three of these CD3-positive samples. Such an incomplete T-cell phenotype always correlated to the presence of a monoclonal process as revealed by genotypic analysis. DNA analysis was the only way to demonstrate clonality in other samples with either a polymorphous (partial involvement, pseudolymphoma, angioimmunoblastic lymphodenopathy [AILD]) or an undifferentiated (large cell anaplastic) phenotype. It is concluded that although in the majority of cases immunophenotyping alone provides criteria adequate for the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancy, in some, particularly polymorphous or large cell anaplastic processes, genetic probe analysis was additionally discriminative.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using the technique of premature chromosome condensation to detect the in vivo maturation of abnormal elements in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute leukemia. Patients were chosen for study if there were a clinical suggestion of in vivo maturation and a leukemic clone exhibiting a distinguishable karyotypic abnormality. Mature peripheral blood granulocytes were enriched by two-step Ficoll-Hypaque gradient sedimentation and fused with mitotic Chinese hamster ovary cells to induce the formation of prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC). These PCC were then analyzed for chromosome number per cell (in the case of patients with a numerical abnormality) or by G-banding (in the case of specific translocations). Of 13 patients chosen for study, 12 showed karyotypic evidence for maturation of the abnormal elements in vivo. Maturation was observed in a number of clinical situations including before treatment in benign CML and myelodysplasia, after low-dose and high-dose chemotherapy in myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and in remission. These results suggest that the technique of premature chromosome condensation can be a powerful tool in better understanding the biology of disease and mode of response to therapy in vivo in patients with leukemia and preleukemic syndromes, especially during treatment with agents thought to induce maturation of the leukemic elements.\r"

Infusion of alpha ABA for five days resulted in four- to fivefold increases in the level of F reticulocytes of normal or chronically anemic baboons. The induction of HbF by alpha ABA was strikingly enhanced by the administration of 5-azacytidine. The addition of alpha ABA in culture produced a concentration-related increase of HbF in baboon CFUe and e-cluster colonies. In addition to the induction of HbF, alpha ABA stimulated the growth of all classes of erythroid progenitors in vivo or in culture. The activation of gamma-globin gene expression by alpha ABA is attributed to an interaction between regulatory sites of globin chromatin modified by alpha ABA and the immature intracellular environment of the expanding erythropoiesis. The combination of chromatin modification, DNA methylation, and the immature intracellular environment of rapid erythroid regeneration may explain the synergistic induction of HbF by alpha ABA and 5-azacytidine.\r"

  ".W": "A new human megakaryocytic cell line (Dami) has been established from the blood of a patient with megakaryoblastic leukemia. The Dami cells grow primarily in suspension with a doubling time of 24 to 30 hours. By light and electron microscopy, the Dami cells range in size from 12 to 120 micron in diameter and have lobulated nuclei characteristic of megakaryocytes. At least 89% of the cells react with monoclonal antibodies against platelet glycoproteins (GP) Ib and IIB/IIIa, and glycophorin. The cells do not react with antibodies against lymphoid, monocyte, granulocyte, or macrophage antigens. Thirteen percent of the cells become polyploid, spontaneously achieving greater than 4N DNA ploidy levels. In response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the proportion of cells with ploidy levels greater than 4N increased threefold and could be separated into discrete ploidy groups. PMA also increased the expression of GPIb, the GPIIb/GPIIIa complex,l and von Willebrand factor. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a human male hyperdiploid karyotype with a modal chromosome number of 54 to 64 and several consistent clonal chromosomal abnormalities. These included a partial deletion of chromosome 5 and a translocation involving chromosome 3. In contrast to other megakaryocytic cell lines in which only a small portion of the cells express the megakaryocytic phenotype, nearly all of the Dami cells express platelet glycoproteins. Thus, the Dami cells provide a superior model in which to study human megakaryocyte biochemistry and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the molecular basis of platelet:fibrin binding by studying interactions between platelets and protofibrils, soluble two-stranded polymers of fibrin, which are intermediates on the fibrin assembly pathway. The specificity of these interactions was examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which clearly showed thin fibers with lengths to 150 nm attached to the cell surface of normal, stimulated platelets. Immunogold electron microscopy using rabbit anti-human fibrinogen as the first stage antibody verified the identity of the surface-bound molecules, and the immunogold distribution paralleled that observed with the fibrin/fibrinogen molecules alone. Contacts between the ends of the fibers and the platelets were frequently observed, but lateral contacts were also evident. Given the diameter at the point of fibrin contact (18.2 +/- 1.3 nm), it is possible that several glycoprotein receptors were involved in binding each protofibril. Morphometric analyses demonstrated that normal platelets stimulated by ADP in the absence of exogenous fibrin(ogen) or in the presence of fibrin protofibrils and antibodies directed against the GPIIb/IIIa complex lacked this molecular layer on the surface. Neither protofibrils nor fibrin fibers adhered to the surface of Glanzmann's thrombasthenic platelets, as demonstrated by TEM and microfluorimetry. Synthetic peptides of sequence RGDS and HHLGGAKQAGDV effectively blocked the binding of protofibrils to the surface of normal, stimulated platelets while synthetic GHRP had no effect. These results provide direct evidence for multiple points of attachment between fibrin protofibrils and the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complexes present in a functional conformation on the surface of normal, stimulated platelets.\r"

Forty-four percent responded with greater than 75% reduction in calculated tumor mass, including three patients who achieved a complete remission. The response rate to HDM was 56% in 18 relapsing patients and 50% in 12 patients with less than 12 months of primary drug resistance, but it was only 23% among the remaining 13 unresponsive patients. A high early mortality rate of 30% was confined to 26 patients with either poor performance (Zubrod greater than 1) or impaired renal function (creatinine greater than 1.4 mg%). When this toxic treatment was given to the 21 patients with good performance (Zubrod less than 2) whose disease lacked high serum lactic dehydrogenase (less than or equal to 500 U/L) as a recently recognized feature of high-grade myeloma, a superior median survival of 18 months was obtained as opposed to only 3 months for the 22 remaining patients (P less than .001). Thus, when employed in a timely fashion, HDM overcomes resistance to standard chemotherapy and VAD and benefits selected patients with advanced myeloma.\r"

Cytogenetic analysis of the cell line demonstrated two clones with variations: a hypodiploid clone, with a complex karyotype including a t(11;14)(q13;q32) similar to the original tumor cells, and a near tetraploid clone with the same markers. Southern blot analysis of DNA from the patient's neoplastic cells and NCEB-1 demonstrated identical Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement, confirming the origin of the cell line. The cell line was not tumorigenic when tested in an in vitro assay using immunosuppressed mice.

We clearly demonstrated that the antifactor Xa activity of heparin contributed little in its anticoagulant activity. The inhibition of factor Va generation, dependent on the heparin antithrombin activity only, is of prime importance to the inhibition of thrombin generation in plasma. The inhibition of thrombin generation by the LMWH was comparable with that of standard heparin on the basis of their respective antithrombin specific activities, but not on the basis of their antifactor Xa activities.\r"

Sixteen children with SS disease were followed for 3.3 to 8 years (mean, 6.8 years), and a single crisis rate was calculated for each patient. At the time of well visits, cellular hydration was assessed by measuring cell deformability, the percentage of red cells with a density greater than or equal to 1.1056 g/mL, and the percentage of irreversibly sickled cells (ISC). The incidence of painful crisis showed a strong positive correlation with Omax, a deformability measurement reflecting cellular hydration (r = .84, P less than .002), and with hemoglobin concentration (r = .59, P = .04). That is, higher crisis rates were observed in patients with less dehydrated, more deformable red cells and also in patients with higher hemoglobin concentrations. Furthermore, cell deformability and hemoglobin concentration were independent predictors of the incidence of painful crisis, which is consistent with separate effects of these two red cells parameters on vasoocclusive severity.\r"

The concentration of CFU-E in the posttreatment marrow increased by a mean of 4.15-fold, BFU-E by 3.37-fold, CFU-GM by 1.86-fold, and CFU-Mk by 1.96-fold as compared with their respective concentrations in the pretreatment marrows. This increase in the concentrations of marrow progenitors was accompanied by almost a doubling of the percentage of these cells in DNA synthesis as assessed by the 3H-thymidine suicide technique. These observations demonstrate that at the progenitor cell level the human marrow responds to therapeutic doses of Epo as an organ rather than by a selective expansion of the erythroid cell line.\r"

Four variables were predictive of attendance or nonattendance: certification status with the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC), year of graduation, sex and hospital affiliation. Physicians who had attended four or more courses were more likely to be graduates of Canadian or US schools, to have graduated after 1969, and to be women, certificants of the CFPC and affiliated with a hospital. Universities, hospitals and professional associations planning continuing education must determine if the needs of nonattending physicians are being met through other means or if new strategies are required to ensure that these physicians have opportunities for upgrading their knowledge. Practitioners who frequently attend short courses can help planners ensure that programming is relevant.\r"

  ".W": "The segmental ventricular function of 76 patients with total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was analyzed to establish the relationship between ventricular function and the presence and angiographic appearance of the collateral circulation. The relationship between function and collateral supply was found to be significant (P less than .01). The only angiographic feature of the collateral vasculature that was associated with preserved function was the caliber of the distal LAD. Wide-caliber vessels were more likely to be associated with preserved ventricular function than thin vessels (P less than .01). In contrast, both rapidly filling collateral arteries and slow filling vessels were associated with preserved ventricular function. Collateral supply maintenance was significantly associated with preserved ventricular function, even when the collaterals arose from stenotic coronary arteries. Furthermore, despite marked differences in ventricular function between the base and apex of the heart, there was a true relationship between preserved ventricular function and the presence of collateral vessels for all segments of the anterior wall. These findings may be relevant to clinical decision making and to proper interpretation of studies of ventricular function following LAD occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "Previous attempts to protect the dependent myocardium during balloon catheter coronary angioplasty in animals and humans have had generally unsatisfactory results. This paper summarizes the authors' experience in investigating commercially available mechanical pumps for distal coronary hemoperfusion during balloon angioplasty. Both roller and piston pumps can attain adequate distal perfusion without significant side effects in the majority of patients. Our goal was to suppress angina for at least 5 min to prolong balloon inflation in awake patients. Minor T-wave changes without concomitant angina pectoris can be expected when the distal coronary bed is perfused with hypothermic blood. Side branch occlusion by the inflated balloon prevents effective protection of the corresponding part of the dependent myocardium during distal hemoperfusion, which may result in persistent angina and ST-T changes uncorrected by increasing the hemoperfusion rate. Distal coronary diffuse spasm, rare and transient, was the only immediate complication of this procedure. It is suggested that intense local wall stimulation could occur with a higher flow rate (jet effect). Improved balloon catheter pressure/flow characteristics and on-line continuous mechanical pumps should soon make distal coronary hemoperfusion through balloon catheters an accepted clinical technique.\r"

  ".W": "Because of a perceived high frequency of ventricular fibrillation when a pacemaker catheter was placed in the right ventricular apex during PTCA, we reviewed our first 400 cases for this complication. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation in the entire group was 10 of 400 cases (2.5%) compared with 17 of 3,806 (0.4%) diagnostic coronary arteriograms performed in our laboratory during the same time period (P less than .001). Ventricular fibrillation occurred more frequently during PTCA when the pacemaker catheter tip was placed in the right ventricular apex (8 of 63 cases, 12.6%) than when it was positioned in either the pulmonary artery, vena cava, or when a pacemaker catheter was not used (2 of 337 cases, 0.6%, P less than .001). Based on these data we have developed a policy of inserting temporary pacemakers prophylactically during PTCA only for patients undergoing dilation of dominant right or dominant left circumflex coronary arteries and in patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"
