  ".U": "90099389\r", 
  ".W": "A cDNA encoding the alpha subunit of mouse skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase was used to compare the expression of alpha mRNAs in normal and phosphorylase kinase-deficient tissues of the I/Lyn mouse. The results demonstrate that two different molecular weight species of poly(A)+ RNA in normal mouse heart and skeletal muscle hybridize to the alpha cDNA. These two mRNAs direct the synthesis of alpha protein and its isoform alpha' in a cell-free translation system. Thus, alpha and alpha' are encoded by two distinct mRNAs. The abundance of both of these mRNAs is reduced dramatically in the phosphorylase kinase-deficient skeletal muscle and heart tissues from the I/Lyn mouse strain. This result indicates that a mechanism common to both alpha and alpha' expression is disrupted by the I/Lyn mutation. The I/Lyn deficiency is inherited as an X chromosome trait. By Southern mapping of Chinese hamster-mouse cell hybrids the alpha gene was localized to the mouse X chromosome, supporting the possibility that the I/Lyn mutation is in the alpha gene. These results are discussed in terms of a cis or trans mutation influencing the expression of either a single alpha/alpha' gene or two genes encoding alpha and alpha'.\r"

Functional measures included 1) a dynamometric test of quadriceps femoris muscle isometric peak torque during the 12th postoperative week and 2) the number of days post-operatively that a patient achieved full active extension of the knee. Twenty-two patients with acute ACL injury were randomly assigned to a Treatment (biofeedback) Group (n = 11) or a Control (nonfeedback) Group (n = 11) during the first therapy session one week after reconstructive surgery. After the patients had completed the 12-week exercise program, the quadriceps femoris muscle isometric peak torque in the operative limb was compared with that in the nonoperative limb at three angles (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 45 degrees) of extension. An analysis of variance revealed significant differences between the Treatment and Control Groups at all three angles. Mean recovery time was calculated for each group, and a t test for independent samples indicated a significant difference between the groups. These results demonstrate that the addition of biofeedback to muscle strengthening exercises facilitates the rate of recovery of quadriceps femoris muscle function following ACL reconstruction.\r"

Ten healthy male subjects between the ages of 40 and 60 years participated in this study. Each subject ambulated at 1.5 mph on a treadmill using two different types of crutches--the standard axillary crutch and the Sure-Gait crutch. After walking on the treadmill without an assistive device, subjects ambulated using a three-point, swing-to gait pattern with one of the two types of crutches. This procedure was repeated using the other type of crutch. Oxygen consumption and heart rate were analyzed using an analysis of variance for repeated measures design. The results of the study showed a significant difference (p less than .01) between ambulation with crutches and unassisted ambulation for oxygen consumption and heart rate. No difference, however, was found between the two crutch types.\r"

Experimental pain threshold at the ipsilateral wrist was determined with an electrical stimulus immediately before and after treatment. The mean change (posttreatment minus pretreatment) for the Experimental Group was greater than the mean change for the Control Group (p less than .05). The Experimental Group demonstrated a statistically significant (p less than .05) increase in mean pain threshold after treatment, but the Control Group did not. Results indicate that helium-neon laser auriculotherapy can increase experimental pain threshold and suggest a possible alternative for patients intolerant of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.\r"

For each torque dependent variable, we calculated a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the measured torque values and the values obtained with prediction equations. The difference between the squared value of the correlation coefficients and the regression multiple R2 values obtained for an original group of 134 subjects ranged between .05 and .10 for the torque dependent variables. The results indicate the validity of the regression models at the level specified by the multiple regression R2 values. Clinicians can use the prediction equations presented in this article to establish rehabilitation goals for patients and can estimate the error involved in applying each prediction equation.\r"

The global intent of the article is to provide information that may be useful in selecting test items. Specifically, the purposes of this study were 1) to examine how two item-sampling strategies (one based on different diagnostic concepts, or diagnostic probes, and the other based on different anatomical sites) influenced the generalizability of a station examination, 2) to determine the interrater reliability during the station examination, and 3) to determine whether the status of the rater (that of observer or simulated patient) influenced the rating. Using a nested study design, 24 physical therapy students were assessed by eight raters. The raters were randomly and equally assigned to four teams. Each team assessed six students. One rater acted as the simulated patient for the first three students in each group, and the other rater acted as observer. This order was reversed for the last three students. Each student performed nine mini-diagnostic patient cases consisting of three diagnostic probes reproduced at three different anatomical sites. The results demonstrate that 1) similar diagnostic concepts can be generalized across anatomical sites, although different concepts or skills cannot be generalized at a given anatomical site or across sites; 2) interrater reliability was excellent; and 3) the status of the raters (ie, simulated patient or observer) did not bias the ratings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ischemic central portions of the flaps were treated with 35 mA of electrical current at a frequency of 128 Hz for 30 minutes twice daily during the initial nine days following skin-flap elevation. The treatment schedule consisted of negative-electrode stimulation during the first three days, positive-electrode stimulation during the second three days, and negative-electrode stimulation during the seventh to ninth days. Five control pigs underwent either no treatment (n = 3) or sham treatment (n = 2). The mean area of the skin flaps exhibiting necrosis was 28.0% in the control animals and 13.2% in the stimulated animals. These areas were significantly different (p less than .001). The results indicate that pulsed electrical stimulation can improve the survival of skin flaps.\r"

Treatment for the restricted metatarsophalangeal joint was aimed at restoring normal motion. After five sessions of mobilizing the restricted metatarsophalangeal joint, the patient was able to return to track without complaint. This case report demonstrates the importance of metatarsophalangeal joint dorsiflexion in the management of forefoot pain.\r"

He was treated with computerized neuro-muscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the quadriceps femoris muscle with weights applied to the ankles an average of two times per week for six weeks. Improvements in the color of the patient's skin and toe ulcers, stronger pedal pulses bilaterally, decreased swelling bilaterally, and subjective reports of less discomfort were noted. The empirical findings of this case report suggest that computerized NMES may be effective for improving circulation in the spinal cord injured individual with acrocyanosis. Further study, however, is needed to determine whether a relationship may exist between blood flow and computerized NMES.\r"

The most common histological lesions were interstitial nephritis, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and a variety of other types of glomerulonephritis. The groups could not be distinguished by the presence or absence of hypertension, haematuria, proteinuria, or features of systemic disease. However interstitial nephritis was found more frequently in patients presenting with one or none of these features and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in patients presenting with three or more. All four patients with none of these features had interstitial lesions. Fifty-two per cent of patients with interstitial nephritis improved and 60 per cent of the patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis who received immunosuppressive treatment improved or remained stable with treatment. The benefits of a biopsy diagnosis were almost wholly confined to these two groups. Complications were recorded in nine patients - prolonged macroscopic haematuria in six and symptomatic perirenal haematomata in three. Six required blood transfusion. One required nephrectomy to control haemorrhage and subsequently died. Percutaneous renal biopsy is not without risk in patients with renal impairment but the benefits of diagnosing interstitial nephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis outweigh the disadvantages.\r"

Predisposition to this type of disease is strongly associated with HLA-DRw9. Generalized myasthenia gravis occurs predominantly in patients presenting after the age of 20 years and is accompanied by high titres of acetylcholine receptor antibody but is less strongly associated with HLA-DRw9.

In 30 patients, in whom the diagnosis was made relatively quickly, response to treatment was excellent and all recovered although two had severe haemolytic crises. Mean age of onset was 11 years (range five to 22). Nine patients suffered toxic reactions to penicillamine and were then treated with trientine. In 22 patients the diagnosis was made after neurological symptoms had supervened; in 20 the signs of hepatic damage had disappeared despite the lack of treatment but in two hepatic signs persisted until the central nervous system was affected. In the 20 patients in whom signs of liver disease resolved spontaneously there was a time interval of from one to eight years before neurological signs developed. All 22 patients in a third group died of hepatic disease without central nervous system involvement. In 19 cases duration of the illness was brief and the diagnosis was made very late or at post-mortem examination. One patient survived with chronic progressive liver damage for 20 years; diagnosis was also made at post-mortem examination. Mean age at death was 15 years. The diagnosis was made retrospectively in 13 patients who died. In two of these the diagnosis was confirmed by determination of the liver copper concentration on tissue saved at postmortem examination; in the other 11 the diagnosis is probable since other siblings developed a similar illness, proven to be Wilson's disease. Age range for these patients was eight to 13 years. Duration of the illness from onset to death was nine days to four years (mean 10 weeks). There was no example of primary carcinoma of the liver in this series.\r"

Hyperlipidaemia was present in older patients, and the daily insulin dose and levels of HbA1 were highest in those with combined hyperlipidaemia. In addition normolipidaemic subjects had the lowest levels of serum creatinine. Triglyceride levels were predicted (in order of importance) by insulin dose, age at diagnosis, HbA1 and body mass index, whilst cholesterol levels were predicted by the age at the time of study, body mass index, urinary protein excretion, and levels of fasting blood glucose and HbA1. Hyperlipidaemia is common in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and may be particularly apparent in older patients and/or those with early renal dysfunction or poor glycaemic control.\r"

One hundred and fifty-six patients have died. The cause of death could not be classified in five. The deaths were divided into those related directly to Crohn's disease and unrelated deaths from incidental causes. The cause and age at death among 59 unrelated deaths was similar to that expected in the general population. The common causes of related deaths were sepsis, digestive tract cancer, pulmonary embolus and metabolic disorders. There were 30 deaths after surgery, usually from sepsis after emergency surgical treatment. There have been fewer deaths in recent years and the cause of death has altered. Sepsis and electrolyte imbalance have declined in importance and cancer of the digestive tract is now the most common cause of related death. Occasional death from sepsis occurs in elderly patients. Elective rather than emergency surgical treatment and the routine use of antimicrobial prophylaxis before surgery has probably reduced mortality. With the exception of cancer of the digestive tract the appropriate medical and surgical treatment of patients with Crohn's disease can eliminate excess mortality previously associated with the disorder.\r"

Twenty-five cases were due to Candida spp., one was due to Trichosporon spp. and in one, both Candida and Trichosporon and an unidentified acid-fast bacillus were isolated. Clinical features of fungal peritonitis and bacterial peritonitis were the same. A direct comparison with patients without fungal peritonitis failed to reveal an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus. However, a history of recent bacterial peritonitis and antibiotic treatment was frequently obtained. We found that the combination of oral ketoconazole and intraperitoneal miconazole is successful in treating fungal peritonitis complicating peritoneal dialysis but catheter removal and replacement is often necessary. Analysis of the relationship between clinical outcome and various treatment strategies in cases reported in the literature and in our own showed that an initial trial of antifungal drugs consisting of oral ketoconazole and i.p. 5-fluorocytosine or miconazole is warranted in most cases before contemplating catheter removal.\r"

Six months after surgery, there had been further improvement; 43 per cent had normal vision and 48 per cent showed an overall improvement. In no patient did vision deteriorate following surgery. In the patients who presented with visual symptoms of one year or less, there was no correlation between the length of symptoms and the extent of visual recovery after surgery. Average age of the patients with full visual recovery was 47 +/- 4 years (mean +/- SEM); average age of the patients with only partial visual recovery was 63 +/- 3 years. Prolactin levels before surgery were elevated in 77 per cent of patients and fell significantly after operation, remaining elevated in 28 per cent of patients six months later. Fifty per cent of patients were treated with long-term hormone replacement therapy. Transsphenoidal surgery led to improved vision in the majority of patients, the results being comparable with those obtained with transfrontal surgery. Surgical complications were few, and long-term morbidity low. We suggest that the first-line treatment for patients with functionless pituitary tumours should be transsphenoidal surgery, even when large suprasellar extensions are present.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of the reduced lung volume in the 'shrinking lung' syndrome of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was investigated in 12 patients with the condition. Nine patients described persistent episodes of pleuritic chest pain. Narrow section (3 mm) computed tomography of the thorax revealed no interstitial fibrosis or significant pleural disease. Assessment of diaphragmatic function using manoeuvres more reliable than the maximal occluded efforts previously used alone to assess respiratory muscle strength, showed that diaphragm strength was unequivocally normal in nine of 12 patients. In three, maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure was moderately reduced, but phrenic nerve stimulation demonstrated that this was due to incomplete activation of the diaphragm during a maximal voluntary effort, rather than to a primary abnormality of the diaphragm. Results of maximum lung recoil pressures and dynamic compliance, and analysis of the 12-s maximum voluntary ventilation, suggested a restriction in chest-wall expansion, although it was not possible to identify the underlying cause of this on the basis of our results. We conclude that the 'shrinking lung' syndrome of SLE is not explained by a primary abnormality of the diaphragm.\r"

Mortality in hospital in patients not known to have diabetes increased significantly from 4 per cent in patients with admission plasma glucose below 8 mmol/l to 35 per cent in patients with admission plasma glucose above 11 mmol/l. In diabetic patients the mortality increased with increasing admission plasma glucose but the difference was not significant. In patients with diabetes mean admission plasma glucose levels of the survivors and those who died were similar, whilst in the non-diabetic group the mean plasma glucose levels of the patients who did not survive were significantly higher than those of the survivors. Stepwise logistic regression analyses identified admission plasma glucose level as an important predictor of mortality in the non-diabetic group but not in the diabetic patients. Plasma glucose level on admission is an important prognostic indicator in non-diabetic patients, in that hyperglycaemia is associated with a higher mortality. In diabetic patients a clear relationship between admission plasma glucose and mortality was not demonstrated.\r"

Most died from either hepatic failure with marked jaundice, infected ascites or variceal bleeding. Fifteen patients had a plasma bilirubin less than 100 mumol/l at the time of death. Twenty-eight patients had had variceal bleeding. Compared with the remaining 31 who had also died from cirrhosis, the patients who had bled from varices survived longer, were much less likely to die of hepatic failure and to become severely jaundiced but were more likely to develop fatal infected ascites.\r"

From March to October 1983, 57 715 prescriptions for five NSAIDs (ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, Osmosin and piroxicam) were issued to 25 959 patients. Their inpatient morbidity from 1 January 1983 to 31 December 1985 was compared to that of an equal number of control subjects matched for age, sex and general practitioner. Analysis revealed that NSAID takers were more likely to develop disease of the gastrointestinal system (ICD 520-579) and symptoms involving the gastrointestinal system (ICD 787). For females the relative risk was 1.67 and for males 1.28. The difference between NSAID takers and controls increased with age above 60 years and was more pronounced over 70 years. Perforation and haemorrhage of peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal haemorrhage was also higher among NSAID takers after prescription: this difference was dependent upon age but not related to sex. The morbidity of the two groups, control and subsequent NSAID takers, was comparable before the NSAID prescriptions were issued and the control rates remained constant throughout the study.\r"

They usually also had a history of other unexplained illness and of deliberate self-poisoning. Management of these patients was difficult and emphasizes the need for specialist expertise for patients with epilepsy and apparent epilepsy.\r"

Radiological features of inflammatory changes were present in all patients; 7 per cent of these were purely apical, 48 per cent were in mid and basal zones and in 46 per cent there was a mixed picture. Cavities were seen in 33 per cent of radiographs; half of these occurred in the apical and half in the mid and basal zones. A pleural reaction was present in 46 per cent of cases. Hilar gland enlargement was not seen. Thus radiographs 'atypical' for pulmonary tuberculosis were usual with the major changes being basal and peripheral. Haematological abnormalities were normochromic normocytic anaemia (66 per cent), neutrophilia (69 per cent), thrombocytosis (33 per cent), rapid erythrocyte sedimentation rate (90 per cent), and lymphocytopenia and monocytosis in 22 and 28 per cent respectively. Biochemical abnormalities were hyponatraemia (60 per cent), hypokalaemia (42 per cent), hypoalbuminaemia (83 per cent), and (before treatment) elevation of bilirubin (20 per cent), alkaline phosphatase (62 per cent), aspartic transaminase (77 per cent) and lactic dehydrogenase (74 per cent). The abnormal liver function tests may reflect unsuspected extrapulmonary disease. Radiologically mild opacification occurring frequently in the lower zones and associated with a pleural reaction in half of cases is compatible with tuberculosis. The unexplained presence of any of these haematological and biochemical abnormalities should raise suspicion of the disease.\r"

Of 398 fetuses, 26 per cent were lost (including therapeutic abortions), 24 per cent surviving infants were premature (less than or equal to 36 weeks gestation) and 51 per cent were term. Excluding therapeutic abortions, 20 per cent of fetuses were lost, 15 per cent after 20 weeks gestation. Fifteen per cent of 237 fetuses whose birth weight was recorded were small for gestational age: Deterioration in maternal renal function was seen in 15 per cent of pregnancies and in 5 per cent of women failed to resolve post partum. Only four women had impaired renal function recorded in the first-trimester and two of these were known to have renal impairment before pregnancy. Hypertension was recorded in 52 per cent of pregnancies, developed early (less than or equal to 32 weeks gestation) in 26 per cent and was severe in 18 per cent. Treated hypertension pre-dated 12 per cent of pregnancies and in 7 per cent (included in the overall incidence of hypertension) exacerbation occurred during pregnancy despite continued antihypertensive medication. Forty-four women (18 per cent) who developed de novo hypertension in pregnancy had permanent hypertension postpartum. Increased proteinuria was recorded in 59 per cent of pregnancies and was irreversible in 15 per cent of women. Comparison of pregnancies which occurred before or after renal biopsy revealed a significantly higher fetal loss rate after 20 weeks gestation in those pregnancies undertaken before the diagnosis of renal disease, and a significantly higher incidence of hypertension and increased proteinuria. Impaired renal function, early or severe hypertension or nephrotic range proteinuria was significantly associated with increased fetal loss, prematurity and fewer full-term infants. There was no significant difference in fetal outcome or maternal complications in pregnancy in patients with treated hypertension before pregnancy and those who were normotensive in the first-trimester. The highest incidence of fetal and maternal complications occurred in patients with primary focal and segmental hyalinosis and sclerosis and the lowest in non-IgA diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. The presence of severe vessel lesions on renal biopsy was associated with a significantly higher total fetal loss and fetal loss after 20 weeks gestation.\r"

These included primary immune dysfunction, immunosuppressive drug therapy including high-dose prednisolone and the presence of cerebral nocardial abscesses. Three of the five patients died, but only two had evidence of continued nocardial infection at necropsy. This compares with mortality of 90 per cent reported in other studies. Therefore aggressive surgical and antibiotic treatment of cerebral nocardial abscesses may reduce the mortality rate in the immunocompromised to the rate seen in immunocompetent patients. We suggest that investigations of non-specific pulmonary symptoms in the immunocompromised should include a search for nocardial colonization as this is indicative of infection. Diagnosis of nocardial infection at the pulmonary stage rather than when central nervous system abscesses are present would lead to an improvement in prognosis.\r"

Seven patients died (overall mortality 0.3 per cent); they were significantly older than the survivors, the mortality being as high as 33 per cent in patients over the age of 70 years. Delayed presentation, coma, hyperpyrexia, pulmonary oedema and acidaemia were more common in the fatal cases. Failure to hyperventilate appropriately may contribute to the development of acidaemia. The prognosis of acute salicylate poisoning cannot be determined from the plasma concentration of the drug alone. Clinical features, particularly impaired consciousness, and the arterial hydrogen ion concentration must be taken into consideration. Haemodialysis is the treatment of choice for severe salicylate intoxication and should be used more liberally than it is at present.\r"

In supine subjects, contiguous transverse 10 mm sections were taken perpendicular to the posterior pharyngeal wall with a 2.1 s scan time. Studies during wakefulness showed that the narrowest section of the pharyngeal airspace was in the region posterior to the soft palate and that the minimal airway cross-sectional areas were significantly reduced in the group of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea compared to the group of control subjects without obstructive sleep apnoea. The studies during sleep showed that in all patients, the airspace posterior to the soft palate was a site of obstructive apnoeas. The length of the obstructed segment varied between patients, extending below the level of the soft palate in half the patient group. Airway narrowing and obstruction was due to posterior displacement of the soft palate and the tongue in the majority of patients, although lateral displacement of the pharyngeal walls was also observed. No occlusion was observed in the laryngopharynx although there was narrowing of oro- and laryngopharyngeal apertures below the site of obstruction during obstructive apnoeas. The size of the oropharyngeal airspace during wakefulness did not predict the presence of airway occlusion below the level of the soft palate when asleep. The variability between patients in the site(s) of upper airway obstruction during obstructive apnoeas have important implications for the choice of appropriate treatment in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea.\r"

Forty-five per cent of patients with alcoholic liver disease and 43 per cent with non-alcoholic liver disease showed evidence of parasympathetic damage; 11 per cent of patients with alcoholic liver disease and 12 per cent with non-alcoholic liver disease had sympathetic damage. Forty-five per cent of patients with alcoholic liver disease and 22 per cent with non-alcoholic liver disease had peripheral neuropathy on clinical examination. Sixty-eight per cent of those with peripheral neuropathy also had autonomic neuropathy. This study confirms that autonomic neuropathy is common in alcoholic patients but the fact that it is found with comparable frequency in non-alcoholic liver disease suggests that the neurological defect may be secondary to the disturbed liver function. The implications of these observations with regard to prognosis of chronic liver disease are discussed.\r"

Two hundred five of the calculi were located in the proximal ureter, above the sacroiliac joint; 27 were in the presacral ureter, overlying the bony pelvis; and 29 were in the juxtavesicular ureter, below the inferior border of the sacroiliac joint. Retrograde ureteral catheters were in place during lithotripsy for 215 calculi. Two hundred fifty-four (97%) calculi were successfully treated with lithotripsy and, when necessary, with additional postlithotripsy radiologic and urologic interventions. Seven (3%) calculi were not successfully fragmented. Nephrostomy was performed in 13 (5%) patients. Retrograde ureteral catheters were not found to enhance calculus fragmentation. In situ lithotripsy of ureteral calculi has been shown to be feasible as an alternative to ureterolithotomy when retrograde manipulation has failed.\r"

The method eradicated the abscess in 31 patients and was palliative in two patients who were subsequently cured by surgery. Prompt defervescence was attributed to reduction of bacterial flora and institution of appropriate antibiotic treatment based on culture of the aspirate and sensitivity studies of organisms. Antibiotic changes or additions were necessary in 10 of the 33 patients, reflecting a lack of agreement with results of urine and blood cultures. The progress of percutaneous drainage was monitored with computed tomography after diffusion of dilute contrast medium in the abscess cavity. Catheter adjustments (in all patients) or additions (in 11 patients) were made necessary by the presence of demonstrated loculated compartments. Only one major complication (a pyopneumothorax) and four minor complications (bacteremias) were attributed to the percutaneous drainage procedure. The mean time for hospitalization and convalescence was substantially reduced with percutaneous drainage. The method is recommended for initial management of all renal, perirenal, and pararenal abscesses.\r"

The initial ileograms obtained 4 weeks postoperatively proved to be unhelpful in predicting future infectious complications, showing abnormalities in only two of 10 patients. Ileography and CT performed at the time of the complications showed abnormalities in eight of nine and nine of 10 patients, respectively. Ileographic abnormalities in patients with abscesses included extravasation of contrast material, extraluminal gas collections, thickening of ileal pouch folds, and extrinsic mass effect on the pouch. CT findings included thickening of the pouch and/or rectal walls, streaky areas of soft-tissue attenuation within the ileal pouch mesentery and perirectal fat, and areas of soft-tissue attenuation or fluid attenuation in the peripouch region. CT was more valuable in depicting the site and extent of abscess formation before surgical or percutaneous drainage.\r"

All patients were age and sex matched to control subjects who were referred for barium enema study and who had no defecation disorder. There were no statistically significant differences between either patient group and the control group in anorectal angle and excursion of the anorectal junction. In the 32 patients and 155 consecutive patients referred for defecography because of a variety of defecation disturbances, approximately twice as many rectal wall abnormalities were seen compared with findings in the control group. These findings included intussusception, rectal prolapse, rectocele, mucosal prolapse, spastic pelvic floor, descending perineum syndrome, and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. In conclusion, the main role of defecography is to document rectal wall changes during defecation straining as possible causes of evacuation difficulties. Clinical symptoms should also be taken into account when treatment is contemplated.\r"

Eleven patients also had solitary rectal ulcers. Two to 3 months after surgery, patients underwent defecography, and results were correlated with postoperative symptoms. In all three patients with rectal prolapse, and 13 of 20 with intussusception, findings on postoperative defecograms were normal and symptoms were gone. Abnormalities and symptoms persisted in two patients and recurred in another two. In five patients, symptoms persisted despite normal defecographic findings. In 11 patients with solitary rectal ulcers, rectal lesions were cured in nine; in two, intussusception and rectal lesions recurred. Thus, presence or absence of solitary rectal ulcer corresponded to postoperative symptoms in all cases. Symptoms and postoperative defecographic findings corresponded in 20. This study suggests that rectal intussusception and prolapse most likely lead to defecation disorders and that defecography is useful in detecting them.\r"

Three patients developed gallbladder cancer that was diagnosed 4, 11, and 72 years, respectively, after cholecystostomy. One other patient had gallbladder carcinoma diagnosed 7 months after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for common bile duct stones. The tumor was probably present but not identified at the time of lithotripsy. The last patient had undiagnosed gallbladder malignancy at the time of cholecystostomy for treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis. Gallbladder carcinoma has been reported in 1% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy, and the risk of carcinoma developing in patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis has been estimated at less than 1%. These figures should not diminish the role of gallbladder-preserving treatments in elderly and selected high-risk patients for whom cholecystectomy may be hazardous. However, such patients must undergo a thorough imaging assessment both before and after treatment to ensure that a gallbladder carcinoma is not overlooked.\r"

The primary tumor, as well as tumor spread beyond the gallbladder, was hyperintense on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images when compared with the liver parenchyma. Liver invasion and metastasis could be depicted by MR imaging with both sequences, unless the tumors were small or the extent of invasion was minimal. Duodenal invasion was difficult to evaluate because of motion artifacts, paucity of fat, and partial volume effects. T1-weighted images readily demonstrated extension of the tumor to the hepatoduodenal ligament and para-aortic region with good contrast between tumor and surrounding tissue. The extent of tumor extension to the blood vessels was also easily evaluated because of flow void in the vasculature. MR imaging can help determine the extent of gallbladder carcinoma and can contribute to the staging of this disease.\r"

Lesion detection, pharmacokinetics, and relative body distribution were evaluated and compared with those of the intact immunoglobulin (IgG1) antibody. Stabilized F(ab')2 fragments were more useful than the intact antibody in detection of lesions: Overall sensitivity of F(ab')2 fragments for all the patients was 79.4%, whereas overall sensitivity of the intact IgG1 antibody was 32%. This anti-CEA-stabilized F(ab')2 fragment may be a powerful diagnostic tool that can achieve higher sensitivity at smaller protein doses than the intact IgG1 antibody.\r"

At 0.5 T, 98 lesions were detected with the IR sequence, 86 with the T1-weighted SE sequence, and 96 with the T2-weighted sequence. At 1.5 T, 93 lesions were detected with the IR sequence, 70 with the T1-weighted SE sequence, and 99 with the T2-weighted sequence. Although the lack of pathologic correlation precluded establishment of true sensitivity and specificity rates, data showed that magnetic field strength resulted in no significant difference for detecting focal hepatic lesions. No single sequence was shown to be significantly superior, although the T1-weighted SE sequence at 1.5 T was significantly inferior to the other sequences for detecting focal hepatic lesions. T1-weighted SE imaging at 0.5 T was significantly inferior to T1-weighted IR and T2-weighted imaging at both magnetic field strengths for detecting focal lesions in the left lobe of the liver. The authors conclude that T1-weighted IR and T2-weighted sequences alone will result in optimal MR imaging for the detection of focal hepatic lesions at 0.5 and 1.5 T.\r"

Analysis of these data led to the conclusion that the radiologist should encourage an expanded role for the technologist as a breast health educator. By incorporating the use of a well-designed patient brochure, technologists can greatly enhance their effectiveness by decreasing the patient's anxiety and increasing her understanding of the procedure and of the importance of screening. Radiologists need to appreciate the potential of an expanded technologist's role for increasing future referrals.\r"

To test the reader detection performance with the two modalities under clinical conditions, the authors compared 140-kVp isoexposure SR (system resolution: 0.2 mm, 10 bits) and FR images of a variety of chest abnormalities proved by computed tomography (CT) (157 patients, 244 abnormalities, 5,652 observations, six readers). In all tests, SR was as good as or better than FR (P less than .05). In overall detection, indicated by the average area of receiver operating characteristics, SR and FR were equivalent. SR was superior for mediastinal lesions and for pulmonary opacities greater than 2 cm in diameter. For all other types of pulmonary lesions and pleural abnormalities, SR and FR were equivalent. Currently available commercial SR systems can replace film radiographic systems in the detection of a wide variety of chest lesions. SR is likely to enable better visualization than FR in the detection of mediastinal and large pulmonary abnormalities.\r"

CT features of septic emboli included multiple peripheral nodules ranging in size from 0.5 to 3.5 cm (15 of 18 patients [83%]), a feeding vessel sign (n = 12; [67%]), cavitation (n = 9; [50%]), wedge-shaped peripheral lesions abutting the pleura (n = 9 [50%]), air bronchograms within nodules (n = 5 [28%]), and extension into the pleural space (n = 7 [39%]). In six of the 18 patients, CT was the first modality (before radiography) to show lesions compatible with septic emboli. In five clinically unsuspected cases, CT first suggested the correct diagnosis of septic emboli. In eight patients, CT also enabled identification of more parenchymal lesions, presumed to be septic emboli, and more pleural involvement than chest radiographs, thus demonstrating a greater extent of disease. The authors conclude that CT is an important modality for confirming the presence of pulmonary septic emboli even when conventional chest radiographs remain negative. In the proper clinical setting, characteristic CT features of septic emboli can suggest the correct diagnosis.\r"

The arthropathy of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease was seen in two of the patients and pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like syndrome in three. Identification of calcific particular masses on radiographs is characteristic of tumoral calcinosis. Marrow lesions could be identified as patchy areas of calcification (calcific myelitis) in long bones and the calvarium. Bone scintigraphy appears to be the best modality for detection of the masses and marrow lesions and for monitoring therapy. At CT the masses demonstrated a varied appearance, from small and solid to large and cystic. The marrow abnormality appears as an area of increased attenuation and spotty calcification that in the skull may be associated with dural and vascular calcifications. MR imaging of the particular masses was remarkable in that the masses displayed high signal intensity on T2-weighted images despite a large calcific component. Marrow lesions also showed increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. When calcified particular masses are present the diagnosis is rarely in question. The diagnosis may be overlooked, however, when calcific myelitis is the only manifestation.\r"

  ".W": "Dual-energy bone densitometry can be performed with two types of scanners. The traditional dual-photon absorptiometry (DPA) machines use an isotope source, whereas the newly introduced dual-energy radiography (DER) devices use an incorporated x-ray tube. The authors evaluated the performance of DPA and DER devices at their institution. The short-term precision error in vivo was 1.2% for femoral neck measurements with DER. Long-term precision error in vitro was reduced from 1.30% (DPA) to 0.44% (DER). The scanning time for both spine and hip measurements was reduced from 20-40 minutes to 6-7 minutes. Intraosseous fat sensitivity remained the same, at a level of 12 mg/cm2 apparent decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) per 10% fat by volume change, and for both devices there was no shift in BMD when phantom thickness was increased by 1.5 inches. The correlation of DPA and DER was high: r = .98 for the spine and r = .95 for the femoral neck. Correlation of DPA versus quantitative computed tomography (CT) (r = .83) and DER versus quantitative CT (r = .85) was good. The advent of DER represents a significant advance for the field of bone densitometry.\r"

MR imaging was more sensitive than CT in the detection of osteomyelitis (94% vs 66%, P less than .025) and abscesses (97% vs 52%, P less than .001). MR imaging was equally specific as CT in the exclusion of osteomyelitis (93% vs 97%, chi 2 = 0) but less specific than CT in the exclusion of abscesses (77% vs 100%, P less than .025).

Fourteen patients with musculoskeletal neoplasms underwent treatment protocols including intraarterial chemotherapy (n = 14), radiation therapy (n = 6), and systemic chemotherapy (n = 14). All patients underwent MR imaging before and after treatment, and all underwent either limb salvage surgery (n = 8) or amputation (n = 6) within 1 week of the last MR examination. Standard unehanced spin-echo T1-, spin-density-, and T2-weighted MR sequences were used. The MR images were compared with the pathologic specimens. On T2-weighted images, the signal intensities of viable tumor, tumor necrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis overlapped. With the unenhanced spin-echo technique, MR imaging cannot be used to predict the percentage of tumor necrosis in musculoskeletal neoplasms after intraarterial chemotherapy.\r"

Blood samples from the right hepatic vein and a peripheral vein were drawn before and 30, 60, 120, and 210 seconds after each intraarterial secretin (IAS) injection. A 50% rise in gastrin level in the 30-second sample from the hepatic vein localized the gastrinoma to the head, body, or tail of the pancreas, depending on the artery into which secretion was injected. IAS results were positive in seven of 13 patients (54%); selective angiography was positive in five of 13 (38%); and the combined study, selective angiography with IAS injection, was positive in 10 of 13 (77%). Portal venous sampling was positive in six of 13 (46%). Selective IAS injection, combined with angiography, is the most sensitive study for localizing gastrinomas and avoids percutaneous transhepatic catheterization for portal venous sampling.\r"

Similarly exposed or unexposed sperm were used to fertilize unexposed eggs, and the same parameters were observed. There was no evidence that MR imaging exposure at 0.15 or 4.5 T had any effect on cleaving embryos or tail bud formation. Since embryogenesis in amphibians is very sensitive to foreign insult, the authors conclude that exposure to a magnetic field of up to 4.5 T has no adverse effect on early development.\r"

Nineteen catheters remained in place after a mean of 65 (range, 13-236) days. Thrombosis-related catheter dysfunction occurred in eight patients, two of whom developed IVC occlusion. Thrombolytic therapy restored catheter function and dissolved clots in all patients. Ten catheter malpositions resulted in venous access failure.

With regard to the presence of a pulmonary confluence, results of MR imaging and angiography were in agreement in 31 of the 35 patients (89%), results of echocardiography and MR imaging were in agreement in 27 of 33 patients (82%), and results of echocardiography and angiography were in agreement in 27 of 33 patients (82%). There was good correlation of measurements of main pulmonary artery size among all three methods and of right and left pulmonary artery size obtained at MR imaging and angiography. Echocardiographic measurements of right and left pulmonary artery size correlated poorly with those obtained at MR imaging and angiography. Results indicated that MR imaging is useful in evaluating the pulmonary arteries in patients with congenital heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis of computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images and clinical records of 39 patients with retropharyngeal space (RPS) lesions was completed. The review was undertaken to answer the following questions: (a) what is the spectrum of lesions of the RPS? (b) what imaging features mark a lesion as originating in the RPS? and (c) is there a difference between the radiologic pattern of the suprahyoid and infrahyoid portions of the neck? Of the 39 patients in the study, nine had RPS infections, 17 had RPS malignancies, two had benign tumors, seven had RPS pseudotumors, and four had hematoma or air in the RPS after trauma. RPS lesions demonstrated two distinct radiologic patterns: a nodal pattern and a nonnodal pattern. The nodal pattern, found only in the suprahyoid neck, occurs when infection or tumor begins in the lymph nodes of the RPS. The lesions may be unilateral or bilateral, but the middle part of the RPS is spared. The nonnodal pattern, found primarily in the infrahyoid RPS, results when the infection or tumor directly invades the RPS or goes beyond the nodes of the RPS. The nonnodal lesion appears rectangular and spans the RPS from side to side.\r"

The treatment and prognosis are altered when perineural extension occurs. Awareness and proper evaluation are critical for the radiologist. The third (mandibular) division of the trigeminal nerve (V3), passing through the skull base via the foramen ovale, is a common route of perineural spread of head and neck lesions. Seven patients with perineural tumor involvement of the mandibular nerve were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging with use of standard spin-echo pulse sequences emphasizing T1-weighted information. Three patients had adenoid cystic carcinoma, three had squamous cell carcinoma, and one had well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma of the orbit. MR imaging signs of perineural involvement included smooth thickening of V3, concentric expansion of the foramen ovale, replacement of the normal trigeminal cistern hypointensity by an isointense mass, lateral bulging of cavernous sinus dural membranes, and atrophy of masticator muscles.\r"

Narrow sagittal diameter of the spinal canal and severe cervical spondylosis were frequent contributing factors to hyperextension injury of the cervical spinal cord. Clinical and radiographic premyelography screening is suggested, with magnetic resonance imaging performed first in patients with spinal canal stenosis, severe spondylosis, and/or myelopathy of any cause. Neck extension should be minimal during myelography. All C1-2 punctures should be monitored with lateral fluoroscopy for accurate needle positioning and prevention of contrast medium injection into the spinal cord.\r"

MR imaging was also performed before and after enhancement in 60 patients for reasons other than evaluation of metastases or calvarial tumor, to determine the apperance of the normal calvaria with enhancement. The normal pattern of fat distribution in the diploic space was typically symmetric. Except for enhancement of diploic veins and meninges near pacchionian granulations, the normal diploic space did not enhance. Calvarial metastases typically enhanced with Gd-DTPA. Enhanced MR images were superior to nonenhanced studies for detecting subtle intradiploic metastases but were inferior to nonenhanced studies for detecting tumor extension into fat-containing areas. Careful comparison of nonenhanced and enhanced MR images is required for complete evaluation of lesions affecting the calvaria and skull base.\r"

Intervals between surgery and MR imaging ranged from 1 day to 40 years (median, 1.3 years). Moderate or marked brain and dural enhancement was noted in nearly every patient imaged within 3 months of surgery, but all brain enhancement was gone by 1 year. Abnormal dural enhancement was noted in every patient imaged within 1 year of surgery and in approximately 50% at 1-2 years afterward. One patient had persistent mild enhancement of the dura 40 years after surgery. MR images revealed enhancement in several sites not frequently recognized on computed tomographic (CT) scans. Brain and meningeal enhancement with Gd-DTPA at cranial operative sites was more extensive and persisted much longer than is commonly seen on contrast-enhanced CT scans. Enhancement of the brain or pia mater does not normally last beyond 1 year, but dural enhancement may persist for decades.\r"

The respiratory and genitourinary tracts were the most common sources of bacteremia. Seven patients had splenectomies prior to the onset of bacteremia. The overall mortality was 61%; mortality attributable to pseudomonas bacteremia was 48%. Statistically significant differences in mortality were related to underlying conditions and portal of entry. Findings in this series were compared with those in published series from different institutions over a period of years.

None of the patients underwent extensive surgical drainage of the deep neck spaces. A nonsurgical approach with antibiotics, including high doses of benzylpenicillin, and computed tomography-guided selective needle aspirations proved successful.

Gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) were the commonest bacterial organisms isolated, constituting 38 (76%) of 50 positive cultures; infection with Staphylococcus was rare (10%). Infective hepatitis, malaria, and systemic tuberculosis were responsible for fever with neutropenia in 20, 4, and 2 patients, respectively. Three hundred fifty-two patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies were also retrospectively studied to determine the pattern of infection. Only 53 infective episodes were recorded. In these patients, in contrast to those with acute leukemia, viral infection (33 [62.3%] of 53) and pulmonary tuberculosis (18 [34%] of 53) were frequently seen. It is interesting that 50% of our patients with hairy cell leukemia also had tuberculosis. Bacterial infection was conspicuous by its absence.

Forty-nine patients with melioidosis complicating diabetes mellitus, collagen vascular disorders, leukemia/lymphoma, and other hematologic malignancies are described. Twenty-nine of these patients had disseminated/septicemic infection, two developed toxic shock syndrome, and one with AIDS experienced recrudescent melioidosis. Patients with disseminated melioidosis often have a variety of defects in cellular immunity both in vitro and in vivo. In humans with recrudescent melioidosis, cellular immunity can be transferred by a transfer factor and by levamisole, a cellular immunopotentiating agent. The results of the treatment of our patients with disseminated/septicemic melioidosis with antimicrobial agents in combination have been successful. In recent years, four cases of fungal arteritis due to Pythium species and one case of keratitis due to Pythium were seen. Almost all patients with fungal arteritis had thalassemia; all presented with pain in the lower extremities and gangrenous lesions of the toes. Pythium species, an aquatic Phycomycetes, was identified in these cases as a human pathogen on the basis of clinical features, pathologic findings, and--of greatest importance--the isolation of the etiologic fungi. These five cases with remarkably similar presentations exhibited certain similarities with and differences from cases of mucormycosis, entomophthoromycosis, and peniciliosis.\r"

  ".W": "Allelic deletions involving chromosome 18q occur in more than 70 percent of colorectal cancers. Such deletions are thought to signal the existence of a tumor suppressor gene in the affected region, but until now a candidate suppressor gene on this chromosomal arm had not been identified. A contiguous stretch of DNA comprising 370 kilobase pairs (kb) has now been cloned from a region of chromosome 18q suspected to reside near this gene. Potential exons in the 370-kb region were defined by human-rodent sequence identities, and the expression of potential exons was assessed by an \"exon-connection\" strategy based on the polymerase chain reaction. Expressed exons were used as probes for cDNA screening to obtain clones that encoded a portion of a gene termed DCC; this cDNA was encoded by at least eight exons within the 370-kb genomic region. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA specified a protein with sequence similarity to neural cell adhesion molecules and other related cell surface glycoproteins. While the DCC gene was expressed in most normal tissues, including colonic mucosa, its expression was greatly reduced or absent in most colorectal carcinomas tested. Somatic mutations within the DCC gene observed in colorectal cancers included a homozygous deletion of the 5' end of the gene, a point mutation within one of the introns, and ten examples of DNA insertions within a 0.17-kb fragment immediately downstream of one of the exons. The DCC gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of human colorectal neoplasia, perhaps through alteration of the normal cell-cell interactions controlling growth.\r"

Thirteen known genes, one chromosome 11-specific DNA repeat, and 36 random clones were analyzed. High-resolution mapping was facilitated by using digital imaging microscopy and by analyzing extended (prometaphase) chromosomes. The map coordinates established by in situ hybridization showed a one to one correspondence with those determined by Southern (DNA) blot analysis of hybrid cell lines containing fragments of chromosome 11. Furthermore, by hybridizing three or more cosmids simultaneously, gene order on the chromosome could be established unequivocally. These results demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly producing high-resolution maps of human chromosomes by in situ hybridization.\r"

U1 snRNP proteins as well as base-pair interactions between U1 snRNA and the 5' splice site are important for the formation of the snRNP-pre-mRNA complex. To determine which proteins are needed for complex formation, the ability of U1 snRNPs gradually depleted of the U1-specific proteins C, A, and 70k to bind to an RNA molecule containing a 5' splice site sequence was studied in a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. The most significant effect was always observed when protein C was removed, either alone or together with other U1-specific proteins; the binding was reduced by 50 to 60%. Complementation of protein C-deficient U1 snRNPs with purified C protein restored their 5' splice site binding activity. These data suggest that protein C may potentiate the base-pair interaction between U1 RNA and the 5' splice site.\r"

Neither FeCl3 in combinations with H2O2, nor Fe3+ or Fe2+ chelated with EDTA, nor Zn2+-protoporphyrin IX, nor protoporphyrin IX caused significant inactivation of FRP. FRP that had been inactivated by hemin remained chemically intact, as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Inclusion of chelators of iron or free radical scavengers did not alter the inactivation produced by hemin. These and other results indicate that hemin derepresses ferritin synthesis in vitro.\r"

The inhibitory activities were associated with the carboxyl-terminal, heparin-binding region of the molecule and could be abrogated by including heparin in the test samples, an indication that sulfated polysaccharides might modulate the angiostatic activity of platelet factor-4 in vivo. Understanding of the mechanisms of control of angiogenesis by endogenous proteins should facilitate the development of effective treatments for diseases of pathogenic neovascularization such as Kaposi's sarcoma, diabetic retinopathy, and malignant tumor growth.\r"

  ".U": "90100566\r", 
  ".W": "A nonlysosomal pathway exists for the degradation of newly synthesized proteins retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway is extremely selective: whereas some proteins are rapidly degraded, others survive for long periods in the ER. The question of whether this selectivity is due to the presence within the sensitive proteins of definable peptide sequences that are sufficient to target them for degradation has been addressed. Deletion of a carboxyl-terminal sequence, comprising the transmembrane domain and short cytoplasmic tail of the alpha chain of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR-alpha), prevented the rapid degradation of this polypeptide. Fusion of this carboxyl-terminal sequence to the extracellular domain of the Tac antigen, a protein that is normally transported to the cell surface where it survives long-term, resulted in the retention and rapid degradation of the chimeric protein in the ER. Additional mutagenesis revealed that the transmembrane domain of TCR-alpha alone was sufficient to cause degradation within the ER. This degradation was not a direct consequence of retention in the ER, as blocking transport of newly synthesized proteins out of the ER with brefeldin A did not lead to degradation of the normal Tac antigen. It is proposed that a 23-amino acid sequence, comprising the transmembrane domain of TCR-alpha, contains information that determines targeting for degradation within the ER system.\r"

Peptides carrying the radioactive moiety were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid analysis, Edman degradation sequencing, and mass spectrometric analysis of these peptides led to the characterization of a posttranslational modification consisting of the successive addition of glutamyl units on the gamma-carboxyl group of a glutamate residue (Glu445). This modification, localized within a region of alpha-tubulin that is important in the interactions of tubulin with microtubule-associated proteins and calcium, could play a role in regulating microtubule dynamics.\r"

CPR excites neurons that modulate or drive (i) body posture, (ii) biting, and (iii) cardiovascular behaviors. CPR also inhibits neurons concerned with defensive responses. Food stimuli, which elicit food arousal in the animal, produce prolonged excitation of the CPR. The results suggest that the CPR may evoke a central motive state representing the neuronal correlate of feeding motivation.\r"

A comparison of steady-state concentrations is made with an oscillatory oxygen input and a constant input at the same average oxygen input for both modes. By varying the frequency and amplitude of the perturbation (O2 influx), the following may be changed: the average concentration of NADH; the Gibbs free energy difference delta G of the reactants and products at steady state; the average rate of the reaction; the phase relation between the oscillatory rate and delta G; and the dissipation. These results confirm the possibility of an \"alternating current chemistry,\" of control and optimization of thermodynamic efficiency and dissipation by means of external variation of constraints in classes of nonlinear reactions and biological pumps, and of improvements of the yield in such reactions (heterogeneous catalysis, for example).\r"

An amenable system for studying axon outgrowth, branching, and target selection is the mammalian corticopontine projection. This major connection develops from parent corticospinal axons that have already grown past the pons, by a delayed interstitial budding of collateral branches that then grow directly into their target, the basilar pons. When cocultured with explants of developing cortex in three-dimensional collagen matrices, the basilar pons elicits the formation and directional growth of cortical axon collaterals across the intervening matrix. This effect appears to be target-specific and selectively influences neurons in the appropriate cortical layer. These in vitro findings provide evidence that the basilar pons becomes innervated by controlling at a distance the budding and directed ingrowth of cortical axon collaterals through the release of a diffusible, chemotropic molecule.\r"

Biplanar roentgenograms of the neck with the head held in neutral and maximally rotated positions were taken in a reference frame. Three sets of x-ray films were measured using a three-dimensional analysis system composed of a digitizer and a personal computer. Total axial rotation was 105 degrees on an average between the occiput and the C7 vertebra. Seventy percent of the total axial rotation occurred between the occiput and the C2 vertebra. Each motion segment between the C2 and C7 vertebrae showed from 4 degrees to 8 degrees rotation on an average. When the head was rotated, lateral bending occurred by coupling in the same direction as rotation at each segment below the C3-C4 level, and in the opposite direction above the C2-C3 level. At the same time, flexion took place by coupling at each segment below the C5-C6 level, and extension above the C4-C5 level.\r"

In patients with vertical settling (VS), MRI showed medullary compression in all those with abnormal Redlund-Johnell values and Ranawat values of 7 mm or less. In patients with anterior atlanto-axial subluxation, compression of the upper cervical cord was observed in all patients with SAC of 13 mm or less and many of those with ADI of 8 mm or greater. This study indicated that medullary compression can be estimated by these values determined in roentgenograms of the cervical spine.\r"

At the follow-up examination, the atlanto-odontoid process interval (AOI) in flexion, neutral, and extension of the cervical vertebrae significantly decreased when compared with the one at the initial examination. This was particularly obvious up to 5 years of age. Although 14 of 69 cases (20.3%) had atlanto-axial instability at the initial examination, this decreased to four cases (5.8%) at the follow-up examination. However, there were two cases of atlanto-axial instability who were over 10 years of age. There was no significant difference in the minimum sagittal diameter (MSD) at the atlantal level between each position at both the initial and follow-up examinations. Moreover, there was a tendency for the MSD of the cases of positive instability at the follow-up examination to be smaller than those of the cases of negative instability. The degree of ligament laxity improved with increasing age and there was statistically the negative correlation. Although there was a tendency for the AOI to decrease with improvement of the degree of ligament laxity, the correlation could not be confirmed.\r"

  ".W": "The manifestations and pathomechanism of cervical instability of the athetoid neck in cerebral palsy (CP) patients was clarified in this study by means of static and dynamic x-ray analysis. Instability was defined as follows: 1) listhesis indicating anterior or posterior slip of more than 3 mm and/or 2) sagittal rotation between two vertebrae beyond the normal range measured by Penning. Cervical instability fitting this definition mainly took place in the upper and middle cervical disc levels, such as C3-4, C4-5, and/or occasionally C5-6. These coincide with the disc levels adjacent to the apex of the lordotic curve and/or those around the transitional vertebrae between the two reversed curves that render the cervical spine S-shaped in athetoid CP. A large facet angle at the apex vertebra facilitated anterior and/or posterior listhesis of the vertebrae. Conversely, a sudden decrease in the facet angle around the transitional vertebra in S-shaped curves precipitated deflection of the spine and increased sagittal rotation at this level. In addition to these structural abnormalities, rapid and repetitious neck movements seemed to accelerate the progression of cervical instability in athetoid CP patients.\r"

Since its spinal canal is wider at the cranial and narrower at the caudal end, a dome-like excision of the inner side of the spinal canal from the caudal toward the cranial end results in the decompression of the lesion, preserving the dorsal part of the C2. The authors performed this C2 dome-like expansive laminoplasty on 33 patients (25 cases of the ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, six of developmental spinal canal stenosis, and two of spondylosis) and kept them under follow-up observation, which ranged from 1 to 7 years (mean, 3.5 years). The result was satisfactory in terms of the decompression and stability of the cervical vertebrae: even 5 years after the operation, no osteogenesis was noted in the expanded spinal canal to induce compression again. It thus may be concluded that this method is good enough to replace conventional laminectomy.\r"

With this approach, there is no need to extend or rotate the cervical spine during the operation. In addition, the operative field extends from the clivus to the fourth cervical vertebra, and safe and sufficient anterior decompression is possible. Although this approach has some disadvantages, contemporary techniques of intravenous hyperalimentation and postoperative respiratory management provide a solution to these problems. Thus, this approach should always be considered for patients requiring extensive anterior decompression of the craniovertebral junction or upper cervical spine.\r"

However, most such cases are diagnosed immediately after surgery, and they appear to be due to inadequate surgical technique or insufficient decompression. Recently, the authors have experienced three cases in which weakness of the deltoid muscle started several days following anterior cervical decompression surgery. On the basis of postoperative plain films, myelography, and computed tomography (CT) myelography, the cause of the motor weakness was considered to be C5 root disturbance due to postoperative malalignment of the cervical spine, which gradually increased. The malalignment of the cervical spine seemed to be due to weakness of iliac bone grafts, inadequate design of the bone graft and recipient site, and insufficient postoperative fixation. To prevent this malalignment, eg, lateral inclination of the bone graft to axial rotation deformity, adequate bone graft design is required. The authors have been performing internal fixation using sapphire screws on cases in which fusion extending over four vertebral bodies is required.\r"

The blood flow was more severly disturbed at the proximal side than the distal side when the nerve root was compressed, but when the clamp was released, the blood flow on the proximal side was almost completely restored, whereas the flow on the distal side did not recover and stayed at the reduced level. These phenomena can be explained both by the direction of blood flow in the radicular vessels and by the peculiar structure of the nerve root, which is soaked in cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

The water content, chemical composition, and swelling pressure in the intervertebral disc were measured, and the mechanism of the generation of the swelling pressure in relation to compression load stress was studied. The swelling pressure, through regulation of the water content of the disc and the resistance of the external load, differs with the region of the intervertebral disc. In the nucleus pulposus and the inner layer of the anulus fibrosus, the swelling pressure rises in proportion to the load, but few changes occur in the outer layer of the anulus fibrosus, and the constant pressure environment is thus maintained. The tritiated water (3H2O) uptake of the disc under various loads was measured. The molar partition coefficient of tritiated water is almost equal to 1 even under a compression load, which suggests that water is freely exchangeable. The diffusion of 3H2O in the intervertebral disc was traced using two pathway models: the perianular route and the end-plate route. The diffusion of water in the unloaded disc for both uptake and washout was about 2 to 3 times larger in the perianular route than in the end-plate route. Under load, the water diffusion was inhibited in both pathways. The relation between the load and displacement revealed viscoelastic properties indicating creep and stress relaxation. Young's modulus and the stiffness increased with a rise in load speed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By histopathologic studies of 14 vertebral columns with vertebral metastases of various malignant tumors and 616 disc specimens, the authors found three pathways for an intravertebral tumor to invade into the adjacent disc: 1) direct infiltration from the rim of the vertebral body not covered by the cartilagenous plate, 2) infiltration from the side of the vertebral body close to the vertebral corner, through the subspace beneath the longitudinal ligament, and 3) hematogenous invasion via small vessels in the subspace beneath the longitudinal ligament. The authors concluded that the cartilagenous plate between the vertebral body and the disc as well as high intradiscal pressure would be acting as a barrier against tumor invasion from the vertebral body into the disc, and suggests that gradual increase of capillaries in the disc with age may enhance hematogenous invasion into the disc in rare occasions.\r"

Ten fresh human cadaveric spine specimens including from L1 to sacrum (six specimens) and ilium (four specimens) were studied. Pure moments of a maximum of 10 N-m were applied incrementally. Parameters of neutral zone, elastic zone, and range of motion for rotations as well as for translations were measured. Neutral zones for flexion-extension, right/left axial torque, and right-left lateral bending were, respectively: 1.6 degrees, 0.9 degrees, and 1.4 degrees (L1-2); 1.0 degrees, 0.8 degrees, and 2.0 degrees (L2-3); 1.4 degrees, 0.7 degrees, and 1.4 degrees (L3-4); 1.8 degrees, 0.4 degrees, and 1.6 degrees (L4-5); 3.0 degrees, 0.4 degrees, and 1.8 degrees (L5-S1).

Types W1 and W2 laminas have the laterally prominent inferior articular processes, but the facet joint spaces are not visible on AP view in Type W1. Type N lamina has narrow inferior articular processes and its facet joint spaces can be recognized on AP view. Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed that the direction of facet joints of Types W2 and N laminas was more sagittal than that of Type W1, and that all of Type N laminas with the narrow inferior articular processes have a sagittal facet. Type N lamina was rarely seen in the 257 controls, but was quite frequent in degenerative spondylolisthesis, 3.5% and 45.8%, respectively. Patients with Type N laminas were likely to show more severe clinical symptoms such as difficulty walking and neurologic deficits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A descriptive survey of hospital tumor conferences, which are also referred to as tumor boards, was conducted by the National Cancer Institute in collaboration with the American College of Surgeons and Roswell Park Memorial Institute. The survey was done to assess the involvement of the tumor conference in the care of the patient with cancer and to lay the groundwork for additional studies of the conference. The data from the descriptive survey are based on questionnaires sent to 1,700 hospitals in the United States. The questionnaires requested information about frequency, attendance, composition, role of the chairman, agenda and other variables that relate to the format and purpose of the conference. From the results, we conclude that tumor conferences are an accepted and established institution for the multidisciplinary care of patients with cancer. They are a major source of consultation and education for physicians and for other professionals involved in oncology. Tumor conferences are conducted in a wide spectrum of hospitals and related institutions that vary in size and function.\r"

  ".W": "Serum cachectin/tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock, may appear in the circulation during serious infection, but the frequency of detection of elevated serum levels during protracted critical burn injury is unknown. Serial serum samples taken from 43 critically ill patients with burns with and without sepsis were analyzed for TNF using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TNF was detectable (greater than 34 picograms per milliliter) at one or more time points in 69 per cent of the patients with sepsis versus 33 per cent of those without sepsis, in 71 per cent of the patients who died versus only 31 per cent of the survivors and in only one healthy normal control patient (n = 21). The frequency of the appearance of TNF correlated with both infection and mortality rate. Moreover, all three patients with TNF levels greater than 540 picograms per milliliter died. Neither the size of the burn nor injury from inhalation correlated with detection of TNF. A subset of 16 patients was studied longitudinally from admission until resolution of injury and these data demonstrate that TNF appears transiently and repetitively in the circulation of patients during infection and protracted critical burn injury. Also, serum cortisol levels were significantly higher during sepsis and death in the absence of serum TNF, compared with sepsis and death with detectable cachectin, suggesting that cortisol may interact with the production or detection of this cytokine during ongoing infection and lethal injury. In this study, we have demonstrated that serum TNF is detectable with greater frequency and in higher concentration in patients with sepsis and in those who ultimately succumb to the burn injury, that serum TNF appears transiently and repetitively in the circulation during injury and that higher serum cortisol levels are correlated with the absence of serum TNF during sepsis and lethal injury.\r"

  ".W": "Cholecystectomy is standard treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Long term relief from symptoms, however, has not been reported. We reviewed 671 elective cholecystectomies performed between 1982 and 1987 for biliary colic (group 1, 91 per cent), dyspepsia associated with gallstones (group 2, 5 per cent) and atypical pain syndromes (group 3, 4 per cent), to define precisely important variables for comparison with alternate methods of gallstone treatment. Cholecystectomy resulted in a mortality rate of zero per cent and an over-all morbidity rate of 4.5 per cent. The procedure-related morbidity rate was 2.2 per cent. Long term follow-up period for 81 per cent of these patients (mean of 45 months) showed that 88 per cent were free of symptoms. Patients in groups 1 and 3 were more likely to obtain relief from symptoms than those in group 2 (p = 0.10). We concluded that cholecystectomy is a definitive treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis with minimal risk to the patient and a high degree of relief from symptoms. Alternative treatments for gallstones must compare favorably with these results of modern cholecystectomy prior to acceptance and widespread use.\r"

Eighty-eight of the 119 specimens (74 per cent) did not have intramural extension distal to the gross distal margin of the tumor. Twenty-five (21 per cent) had intramural extension of less than 5 millimeters from the gross distal limit of the tumor. In these instances, tumoral spread was contiguous. In six (5 per cent), tumoral spread was found at more than 5 millimeters from the gross distal margin of the lesion. In all six specimens, the tumoral extension was separated from the gross lesion by undiseased tissue, the foci being located between 5 and 15 millimeters from the distal margin of the lesion. Lymph nodal involvement was found in 19 of 88 lesions without distal intramural spread, in 14 of 25 tumors with intramural spread of less than 5 millimeters and in five of six with intramural extension of 5 millimeters or more, respectively. The difference was statistically significant. With respect to the same three categories of distal extension, more than one lymph node was involved in 11 of 88 lesions, six of 25 and five of six, respectively. This difference was also statistically significant. In the six instances with distal intramural extension, results of immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the presence of tumoral embolism in both the blood and lymphatic vessels. In carcinoma of the rectum, lymph nodal involvement and its multiplicity are directly related to the extent of intramural spread.\r"

The mean age of the patients was 55 years. Thirty-eight patients were alcoholics or diabetics, or both. All of the infections were of a genitourinary, anorectal or cutaneous source. Thirty-five per cent of the infections were confined to the genitalia and 65 per cent extended to the abdominal wall or thigh, or both. Forty-seven patients survived. Survival was associated significantly with a younger age, a serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of less than 50 milligrams per deciliter at presentation, the absence of a constellation of abnormalities at presentation consistent with sepsis and a decreased incidence of major complications after initial debridement (p less than 0.05 to 0.01). Survival was not associated with the extent of infection, the duration of symptoms before hospitalization, systemic risk factors, the source of infection, abnormal findings at presentation (excluding a BUN of greater than 50 milligrams per deciliter) and the bacteriologic factors of the infection. Both localized and extensive necrotizing fasciitis of the male genitalia are potentially lethal disorders that require prompt treatment.\r"

The ten year over-all survival was studied and compared with that of 4,217 instances of palpable carcinoma of the breast observed during the same period. The ten year survival rates were, by far, better for nonpalpable (94 per cent) than for palpable carcinomas (65 per cent). A better prognosis for nonpalpable carcinomas was confirmed also by multivariate analysis (Cox) with adjustment for potential confounders, such as age, stage or nodal involvement. The possible confounding effect of over diagnosis and length or lead time bias is discussed. Although this difference in survival might be partially explained by the aforementioned confounders, the chance of increasing life expectancy and conservative surgical treatment encourages preclinical detection of carcinoma of the breast.\r"

Quantifying daily drainage into the closed pleural drainage system is easy for nurses and surgical staff alike. We suggest that this type of drainage system is applicable to a wide variety of reconstructions of the abdominal and chest walls involving extensive soft tissue flaps.\r"

At the far end of the continuum, invasive carcinoma can be demonstrated to arise directly from the walls of dysplastic ducts, leaving no room for doubt concerning the malignant potential of this lesion. The identification of dysplasia in nearly half of prostates without cancer and nearly all prostates with cancer suggests that most adenocarcinomas in the prostate may develop from dysplasia. Dysplasia is further defined as a biologic lesion in which cytoplasmic differentiation is reduced and disordered and the intracellular processing of cytoplasmic proteins and glyco-proteins is altered. Further study of these early biologic changes may yield important insights into the biologic nature of the process of malignant transformation.\r"

Of these, 8 did not complete the course of papaverine therapy. A total of 8 had complications, including priapism in 3 and ecchymoses or urethral bleeding in 5. In 30 patients who had substantial vasculogenic disease, there was a notable improvement in the penile blood pressure after papaverine treatment, although only 9 reported successful sexual intercourse. The penile blood pressure in the remaining 12 patients without substantial vascular disease increased modestly after therapy, and 5 persons reported satisfactory sexual activity. We conclude that administering papaverine intracavernosally every 2 weeks improves sexual potency in a subset of sexually impotent patients. Those with severe vasculogenic disease and a penile-brachial pressure index of less than 0.65 are not good candidates for this regimen.\r"

The mean age was 53 +/- 14 years, with acute epiglottitis occurring in 89% during the months of September to March. Intubation was required in 4 patients. The duration of symptoms was 7.8 +/- 2.4 hours for intubated patients versus 18.8 +/- 8.9 hours for those not intubated. For 6 patients an incorrect diagnosis was made on their first presentation. All 8 patients having laryngoscopy had typical findings, and none had respiratory obstruction precipitated by the procedure. In 5 patients blood cultures were positive, 4 for Hemophilus influenzae type b, and 1 for Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 2 patients the H influenzae was ampicillin-resistant. All patients recovered after receiving parenteral steroid therapy and appropriate antibiotics.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacy and therapeutics committee at Hartford Hospital recommended replacement of cefoxitin with cefotetan, based on data reported in the literature regarding antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic profile, and adverse reactions. Once the recommendation was approved by the medical staff, an intense educational program was instituted, and all orders for cefoxitin were converted to cefotetan with appropriate dosage modifications. A total of 960 patients were treated in the first year; no major patterns of ineffectual therapy or adverse events associated with cefotetan usage have emerged. The mean cost of cefotetan therapy was $180.59, which is $130.26 less per patient than a comparable regimen of cefoxitin (mean cost of therapy $310.85). Based on the data analysis of cefotetan usage for a 12-month period, the actual annual savings due to therapeutic substitution of cefotetan for cefoxitin was $124.961. To further evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and savings of this therapeutic interchange, two separate retrospective reviews of patient medical records were performed. The first audit has been previously published in its entirety. In the subsequent audit, 284 additional patient medical charts have been reviewed. These patients received either cefotetan therapy or concomitant therapy of an aminoglycoside combined with either clindamycin or mezlocillin. Clinical outcomes were classified as an empiric cure or improvement for 99.4, 98.5, and 92.9 percent of patients, respectively. In this audit, elevated prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time values and bleeding episodes were noted infrequently, as were other adverse reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were subdivided based on total body weight into two groups, obese and nonobese. Estimated creatinine clearance (EClcr) values were obtained by the Cockcroft-Gault method using ideal body weight (IBW) and total body weight (TBW). These values were then compared with a 24-hour measured creatinine clearance (MClcr). EClcr values based on TBW consistently overestimated measured values in all patients (p less than 0.05). In obese patients with Cushing's syndrome IBW predictions were not statistically different. However, linear regression analysis revealed a poor correlation (r = 0.32). Daily creatinine production rates (Ucr) were calculated and contrasted with an appropriate historical control for obese and nonobese subjects. Nonobese patients revealed a marked reduction in total Ucr compared with normal-weight controls (p less than 0.05). Obese patients also showed a reduction in Ucr when compared with a normal obese control population (p less than 0.05). Difficulty in predicting creatinine clearance in patients with Cushing's syndrome appears to be related to alterations in Ucr. These data suggest that the pathophysiologic changes that accompany Cushing's syndrome are sufficient to alter Ucr and may limit the usefulness of existing methods to predict creatinine clearance and renal function in these patients.\r"

Data were collected using a mailed, self-administered questionnaire. Issues addressed included reasons for using/not using ERT, patient symptoms, type of therapy prescribed, treatment duration, and symptom resolution or rebound. Approximately 25 percent of the 420 physicians contacted responded to the questionnaire. The overwhelming majority prescribes ERT for their patients. Most physicians prescribe an estrogen/progesterone combination for some or all patients, depending on the clinical situation. Conjugated estrogens in physiologic doses and synthetic progestins are most frequently prescribed and administered on a cyclic basis. Most women prescribed ERT experienced symptom resolution. Treatment outcome was not correlated with treatment duration.\r"

Anaphylactic reactions induced by streptokinase occur rarely. We report the case of a patient with acute MI who developed anaphylaxis shortly after the initiation of an intravenous infusion of streptokinase. The patient became profoundly hypotensive and developed an erythematous rash that spread rapidly to cover most of his body. He required mechanical ventilation and the administration of epinephrine for blood pressure support, which succeeded after dopamine and norepinephrine had failed. Streptokinase-induced anaphylaxis is thought to be mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE), and patients who develop this adverse reaction have been shown to have higher serum concentrations of IgE to streptokinase than those who do not. Epinephrine is the agent of choice for the management of hypotension associated with anaphylaxis. Little evidence exists to support the routine pretreatment of patients who are to receive streptokinase with corticosteroids and/or antihistamines. Streptokinase skin testing may be a useful and accurate means of identifying patients at risk for streptokinase-induced anaphylaxis. Further investigation is required to determine the appropriateness of skin testing in streptokinase therapy.\r"

Symptoms consisted of a generalized red macular rash associated with swelling of the face, tongue, lips, and mouth as well as a fever of 40 degrees C. Resolution of symptoms began approximately four days after verapamil discontinuation. Rechallenge with verapamil was not performed. Although SJS appears to be a rare adverse effect of this drug, the potential complications warrant the inclusion of SJS in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with malaise, fever, rash, and a history of verapamil ingestion.\r"

A tapering schedule was carried out during a 12-day stay in the hospital in which the diazepam dosage was reduced by a fixed quantity every day, corresponding to about ten percent of the initial dosage. Five days after discharge from the hospital the patient experienced panic attacks, for the first time, which continued until 13 days after discharge. By the 40th day, the patient was experiencing a major depressive episode, which improved after administration of clomipramine therapy. We suggest that a relatively quick withdrawal schedule (ten percent per day) is probably inadequate in preventing withdrawal reactions to long-acting benzodiazepines taken in high doses for an extended period of time.\r"

To determine the prevalence of dyslipidemias in the presence of coexistent CAD and total cholesterol less than or equal to 200 mg/dl, a retrospective case-control study of 1,000 patients who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography was performed. Of 351 patients with total cholesterol less than or equal to 200 mg/dl, 76% of the men (244) and 44% of the women (107) had angiographically demonstrated CAD. In men with CAD and total cholesterol less than or equal to 200 mg/dl, there was a significantly greater prevalence of low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (less than or equal to 35 mg/dl), age greater than 50 years, systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus compared to non-CAD control subjects. In women with CAD and total cholesterol less than or equal to 200 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol less than or equal to 45 mg/dl and diabetes mellitus were also significantly prevalent. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that HDL cholesterol, hypertension and age in men and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol in women were significantly associated with CAD after adjustment for other risk factors. These results suggest that a complete lipid and lipoprotein analysis be obtained in all patients with CAD, irrespective of the plasma (or serum) total cholesterol level.\r"

The relation of ambulatory electrocardiographic silent ischemia to evidence of completeness of revascularization as defined by cardiac angiography performed 1 and 12 months after CABG, and to prognosis by follow-up of adverse clinical events was analyzed. Silent ischemia was detected early in 20% (19 of 94) and late in 27% (50 of 184) of patients, and showed a mean frequency of episodes ranging from 6 to 10 episodes/24 hours with a mean duration ranging from 15 to 23 minutes. The circadian distribution of episodes disclosed a significant peak of ischemic activity during the period of 6 A.M. to noon and a secondary peak between 6 P.M. and midnight (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001, respectively). Silent ischemia was not found by univariate analysis to be associated with graft or anastomotic site occlusions, low graft flow rates, grafted arteries with significant distal residual stenoses or ungrafted stenotic native coronary arteries. Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to cardiac event showed that silent ischemia was not predictive of an adverse clinical event in the early years after CABG. Cox regression analysis of 30 covariates only disclosed age (relative risk 1.06 [95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 2.94]) as having an effect on time to adverse clinical event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the value of a 6-month exercise treadmill test for detecting restenosis after elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), 303 consecutive patients with successful PTCA and without a recent myocardial infarction were studied. Among the 228 patients without interval cardiac events, early repeat revascularization or contraindications to treadmill testing, 209 (92%) underwent follow-up angiography, and 200 also had a follow-up treadmill test and formed the study population. Restenosis (greater than or equal to 75% luminal diameter stenosis) occurred in 50 patients (25%). Five variables were individually associated with a higher risk of restenosis: recurrent angina (p = 0.0002), exercise-induced angina (p = 0.0001), a positive treadmill test (p = 0.008), more exercise ST deviation (p = 0.04) and a lower maximum exercise heart rate (p = 0.05). However, only exercise-induced angina (p = 0.002), recurrent angina (p = 0.01) and a positive treadmill test (p = 0.04) were independent predictors of restenosis. Using these 3 variables, patient subsets could be identified with restenosis rates ranging from 11 to 83%. The exercise treadmill test added independent information to symptom status about the risk of restenosis after elective PTCA. Nevertheless, 20% of patients with restenosis had neither recurrent angina nor exercise-induced ischemia at follow-up. For more accurate detection of restenosis, the exercise treadmill test must be supplemented by a more definitive test.\r"

  ".W": "Of 6,545 patients who had elective coronary angioplasty procedures performed over a 7.5-year period from June 1980 through December 1987, 114 (1.7%) never had symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia was documented before angioplasty in 94% of these asymptomatic patients. Angioplasty was successful in 87%, whereas emergency coronary artery bypass grafting was required in 4%, and a further 2% had myocardial infarctions after the procedures. The remaining 7% had unsuccessful angioplasty procedures but experienced no in-hospital cardiac events. The follow-up period after hospital discharge averaged 43 +/- 20 months (range 5 to 93). There were no deaths. In the group of 99 patients with initially successful angioplasty procedures the follow-up interval ranged from 5 to 92 months. During that period, 7 patients underwent coronary bypass surgery, 4 patients had myocardial infarction and 30 patients had repeat angioplasty procedures for restenosis. The cumulative probability of event-free survival over 5 years for the group with successful angioplasty was: 100% freedom from death, 95% freedom from myocardial infarction, 87% freedom from myocardial infarction or coronary bypass surgery and 61% freedom from myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery or repeat angioplasty. Thus, coronary angioplasty performed in 114 asymptomatic patients, most with exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia, achieved very good primary success and was accompanied by low cardiac event rates and no deaths over several years of patient follow-up.\r"

Fifty-five patients with coronary artery disease and inducible sustained monomorphic VT not requiring countershock to terminate underwent 81 electrophysiology tests in which 1 to 3 extrastimuli were introduced during sinus rhythm and after basic drive trains of 600 and 400 ms. In 72 electrophysiology tests, sustained, monomorphic VT was induced at the right ventricular apex. The yield of VT using a drive cycle length of 400 ms was 63 of 72 (88%), compared to 46 of 72 (64%) when the drive cycle length was 600 ms, and 23 of 72 (32%) when the extrastimuli were introduced during sinus rhythm (p less than 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons). In 14 electrophysiology tests in which VT was not induced using a 400 ms basic drive cycle length at the apex, the yield of VT was higher using a 400 ms drive cycle length at a second right ventricular site (12 of 14) than with a 600 ms drive cycle length (3 of 12) or sinus rhythm (4 of 12) at the apex (p less than 0.05). The yield of sustained, monomorphic VT induced by 1 to 3 extrastimuli increases as the basic drive cycle length shortens. Whereas programmed stimulation is conventionally started during sinus rhythm or with a drive cycle length of 600 ms, the present results suggest that starting with a drive cycle length of 400 ms may be more efficient.\r"

In many patients, retrograde ventriculoatrial (V-A) conduction may occur and evoke hemodynamic and reflex neurohumoral responses, which are unique to this pacing mode. Accordingly, forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, mean and phasic arterial pressure, cardiac output and plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine were measured during atrial, ventricular and V-A pacing at a cycle length of 600 ms (100 beats/min) before and after regional alpha blockade with intraarterial phentolamine in 16 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 35% and little or no symptoms of congestive heart failure. During V-A pacing, cardiac output decreased by 10%, whereas forearm vascular resistance increased from 52 +/- 7 to 70 +/- 9 U (p less than 0.001) and plasma norepinephrine increased from 183 +/- 27 to 232 +/- 27 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). Phentolamine nearly abolished the increase in forearm vascular resistance in response to V-A pacing (18 +/- 4.1 U before vs 5.8 +/- 1.5 U after, p less than 0.05). The change in forearm vascular resistance with V-A pacing correlated with systolic arterial pressure, but not with changes in mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, cardiac output, mean or peak right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. These results suggest that forearm vascular resistance responses to V-A pacing are mediated mainly by alpha-adrenergic receptors, through the arterial baroreflexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cholesterol was measured with a portable, dry-chemistry analyzer using capillary blood obtained by fingerstick. Data are reported from a total of 13,824 participants, spanning the entire age spectrum. Overall, 25% of screened subjects had blood cholesterol levels above the age-specific cutpoints used in the current study. Although in the aggregate this screening experience very closely approximates the expected level of referrals, the proportion of referred screened subjects differed significantly among the 5 types of screening environments and by gender. Follow-up telephone interviews indicated that 53% of referrals had initiated a physician contact. More than 75% of those who had seen a physician reported that the diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia had been confirmed, and almost 72% had been prescribed a diet. A large proportion of referred screened subjects reported having modified their diet, particularly when recommended to do so by a physician. This study has yielded encouraging evidence that physicians gave referred screened subjects appropriate initial advice for managing hypercholesterolemia. The new technology for blood cholesterol measurement evaluated in the current study has proven to be a feasible and reliable means for measuring blood cholesterol in typical screening settings.\r"

The differences between the intraarterially determined BP and values obtained by the various monitors were then compared to differences between BP measured directly and by 2 clinicians using a standard mercury column in 10 additional hypertensive patients. The monitors studied were the Accutracker II (auscultatory with mandatory electrocardiographic gating), Colin ABPM 630 (auscultatory or oscillometric), Del Mar Pressurometer IV (auscultatory with optional electrocardiographic gating) and SpaceLabs 90202 (oscillometric). During rest, the differences between intraarterially and clinician-determined systolic and diastolic BP were 4 +/- 8 and -4 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively. The Accutracker II and Colin ABPM 630 using the auscultatory method showed less disparity and closer limits of agreement (2 standard deviations of the mean difference) with intraarterial BP than the clinicians' measurements, whereas the other units showed similar or greater limits of agreement. During both isometric and dynamic exercise, mean BP differences between intraarterial and clinician determinations were similar to those at rest but the limits of agreement increased. The limits of agreement between intraarterial and monitor-derived BP also increased during exercise compared to differences observed at rest. The Accutracker II and Colin ABPM 630 using the auscultatory method had limits of agreement with intraarterial BP that were either similar to or less than the clinician's, whereas the Colin monitor using the oscillometric method and the Del Mar Pressurometer IV showed greater disparity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for producing isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in the elderly are generally attributed to a decrease in arterial compliance. However, no consistent theoretical or experimental model has been proposed for the production of ISH. This problem was investigated with the use of computer simulation of the modified Windkessel model, an often-used tool in the study of arterioventricular function. Aortic pressure (Pa(t] and aortic flow (Qa(t] data were used to obtain the model parameters: peripheral resistance (Rs), arterial compliance (C) and characteristic impedance of the proximal aorta (Zo). Using Qa(t) as the input to the model, the effects of altered vascular properties on Pa(t) were studied by changing these model parameters. Graded reductions of C (25, 50 and 75%) alone increased systolic pressure (Ps), but also decreased diastolic pressure (Pd) to values below those found in ISH. On the other hand, an increase in Rs of 25% along with a 50 to 75% increase in C resulted in percent changes in Ps and Pd that would result in ISH from a normal pressure level. These results were consistent for a wide range of pressures. Decreased arterial compliance alone is not always responsible for the production of ISH. Rather, isolated systolic hypertension is usually the result of greatly reduced arterial compliance along with a smaller but significant increase in peripheral resistance.\r"

The current study was designed to determine whether clinical characteristics, including invasive hemodynamic parameters of left ventricular (LV) performance, are predictive of short-term patient outcome. Eighty-one consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled in the study protocol. High-fidelity dual sensor micromanometer catheters, digital ventriculography and aortography and Fick cardiac output were measured before and immediately after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Stroke work was defined from pressure-volume loops. The acute hemodynamic results obtained in patients with overall improved symptoms were compared to those with recurrent symptoms at 3 months. Fifty-three patients (65%) were improved at 3-month evaluation (group 1), whereas 28 patients (35%) had either returned to symptoms at baseline (17), had undergone aortic valve replacement (3) or had cardiac death (8). Compared to patients with improved symptoms, patients with recurrent symptoms demonstrated a lower cardiac output, higher LV end-systolic volume, decreased LV ejection fraction, diminished LV stroke work and decreased LV peak positive dP/dt. The final aortic valve area and change in aortic valve area did not predict which patients would develop recurrent symptoms. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that LV ejection fraction was the only independent predictor of overall status at 3 months (p = 0.002). Eighty-four percent of patients with an ejection fraction greater than 45% were improved. In the group with an ejection fraction greater than 45%, less than half of the patients demonstrated improved symptoms at short-term followup. Parameters of LV performance can accurately predict short-term patient outcome after balloon aortic valvuloplasty.\r"

However, the effect of isometrics on the degree of valvular regurgitation recorded by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) has not been reported. CDFI was therefore used to evaluate changes in valvular regurgitation in 34 patients, mean age 53 +/- 16 years. Data were collected for 43 regurgitant lesions including 20 cases of aortic regurgitation and 23 cases of mitral regurgitation. Isometrics produced a significant increase in heart rate (71 to 83 beats/min) and blood pressure (132/64 to 153/70 mm Hg) in all patients (p less than 0.0001). Regurgitant jet area by CDFI increased significantly in both aortic regurgitation (4.5 to 6.2 cm2, p less than 0.0001) and mitral regurgitation (6.2 to 8.2 cm2, p less than 0.001). Patients taking concurrent vasodilator or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy had similar responses to those not receiving long-term therapy. Thus, CDFI detects an increase in aortic and mitral regurgitant jet area induced by isometric exertion. The change in CDFI jet area with handgrip demonstrates the influence of loading conditions on the size of a regurgitant jet area, and suggests that isometric exertion may increase the magnitude of mitral and aortic regurgitation.\r"

Although the magnitude of the Mayer wave component was unaffected by the smoking status, the respiratory component in the supine position was smaller in the young (less than or equal to 30 years) heavy smokers than in the young nonsmokers or moderate smokers (p = 0.0078). Also, postural changes in the components, a decrease in the respiratory component and an increase in the Mayer wave component with standing, were observed in the nonsmokers but not in the heavy smokers. These results suggest that smoking causes an acute and transient decrease in vagal cardiac control, and that heavy smoking causes long-term reduction in vagal cardiac control in young people and blunted postural responses in autonomic cardiac regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-seven healthy type A men (mean age 42 years) were randomly assigned to either an aerobic exercise training group or to a strength and flexibility training group. Before exercise, subjects underwent comprehensive physiologic and behavioral assessments, including graded exercise treadmill testing with direct measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2) and measurement of cardiovascular (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and rate pressure product) and neuroendocrine (epinephrine and norepinephrine) responses to mental arithmetic. The aerobic exercise consisted of walking and jogging at an intensity of greater than or equal to 70% maximal heart rate reserve for 1 hour 3 times/week for 12 consecutive weeks. The strength training consisted of 1 hour of circuit Nautilus training 2 times/week for 12 weeks. At the completion of the exercise program, all subjects underwent repeat testing. For the aerobic group, peak VO2 increased significantly from 33.6 to 38.4 ml/kg/min (p less than 0.001), whereas the strength group only achieved a slight increase from 34.5 to 35.6 ml/kg/min (difference not significant). During the mental arithmetic, the aerobic group experienced a greater reduction in levels of heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and rate pressure product than the strength group (after completing the exercise training programs). The aerobic group also tended to secrete less epinephrine and to show a faster recovery than the strength group after the exercise program. In addition, the aerobic group tended to exhibit less cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress after exercise training. These data suggest that aerobic exercise reduces levels of cardiovascular and sympathoadrenal responses during and after mental stress.\r"

  ".W": "Sotalol, one of the first beta-receptor antagonists synthesized, is a promising investigational agent with remarkable efficacy for treatment of patients with ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Unlike other beta blockers, sotalol also possesses class III antiarrhythmic action, evidenced by prolongation of the myocardial action potential duration. This additional action probably accounts for the greater antiarrhythmic efficacy of sotalol compared with other beta blockers. Sotalol's class III antiarrhythmic action becomes apparent at concentrations higher than those necessary for significant beta-receptor antagonism, both in vitro and in human subjects. In a study correlating dosage and antiarrhythmic response with prolongation of rate-corrected QT (QTc) (a measure of class III action) and the degree of beta-receptor blockade (assessed by the reduction of the maximal exercise-induced heart rate), 11 of 17 patients had an antiarrhythmic response. Eight of these 11 responders had been unresponsive to conventional beta-receptor antagonists. The plasma concentration associated with significant QTc prolongation (2.55 micrograms/ml) was found to be much greater than that associated with 50% reduction in maximal slowing of heart rate (0.8 micrograms/ml). As with other beta-receptor antagonists, the activities of sotalol's 2 stereoisomers differ, with the I-isomer having far more beta-blocking activity. However, both isomers have equal class III antiarrhythmic activity. When increasing doses of the d-isomer of sotalol (50 to 400 mg every 12 hours) were evaluated in patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmias, arrhythmia frequency was suppressed greater than 80% in 3 patients and 50% in 1 patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The safety and efficacy of oral sotalol, an investigational beta-adrenergic blocker with class III antiarrhythmic drug properties, were examined in a multicenter study in 236 patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In 104 patients, the index arrhythmia was a cardiac arrest, and all patients had undergone at least 3 previous unsuccessful antiarrhythmic trials (mean = 5 per patient). In the 106 patients assessed by programmed electrical stimulation, sotalol completely suppressed induction of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 33 (31%) and rendered VT slower (greater than 100 ms prolongation of cycle length) or more difficult to induce in 29 (27%). Using continuous 24-hour ambulatory monitoring methods, sotalol complete- and partial-response rates were 51 and 12%, respectively. Of the 236 acute-phase patients, 151 were discharged receiving long-term sotalol therapy. The median sotalol dose was 480 mg/day. At a mean follow-up of 346 +/- 92 days, 27 patients (18%) had recurrence of sustained arrhythmia; 9, sudden death; 11, sustained VT; 5, automatic defibrillator discharge; and 2, syncope. Adverse effects forced discontinuation of therapy in 10 patients (7%): 6 secondary to symptomatic bradyarrhythmia, 2 due to refractory heart failure, 1 due to torsades de pointes, and 1 from bronchospasm. Life-table analysis of sotalol's overall long-term efficacy at 6, 12 and 18 months were 80, 76 and 72%, respectively. Although mean follow-up was short (less than 1 year), neither acute-phase programmed stimulation nor 24-hour ambulatory monitoring responses were significantly predictive of subsequent arrhythmic outcome. Proarrhythmia was documented in 18 patients (7%), 17 during the acute phase and 1 during long-term follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The tumor is histologically similar to giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone, and the origin of the multinucleated giant cells and mononuclear stromal cells has not been determined. The purpose of this report is to present a case of this rare tumor and compare its ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features with those of a conventional GCT of bone. Histologically, the HGCC consists of sheets of osteoclast-like giant cells with a background of mononuclear cells. The giant cells lack the pleomorphism seen in hepatocellular carcinomas with anaplastic giant cells. At the light microscopic level, most of this tumor was nearly identical to a GCT of bone, but several microscopic fields (less than 5% of the tumor) had the histologic appearance of a \"usual\" hepatocellular carcinoma. The hepatic tumor was negative for HAM 56, epithelial cytokeratins, muramidase, and alpha-1-antitrypsin, with only focal positivity for chymotrypsin in mononuclear and giant cells. The GCT was strongly positive for alpha-1-antitrypsin and chymotrypsin in both the mononuclear and giant cells and showed focal, weak staining for AE1 and AE3 in the mononuclear stromal cells. Ultrastructurally, both mononuclear and giant cells of the HGCC showed features typical of hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the patient presented in this report died, the pattern of growth was different from most hepatocellular carcinomas. The overall histologic features of this tumor are distinctive and appear to justify separating this variant from other types of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

The operating characteristics, such as within-run precision, linearity, and carryover, fulfilled the manufacturer's specifications and are excellent. Correlation with the standard method, manual reticulocyte counting, is linear for normal and high values. For low reticulocyte counts the regression points show a deviation from their linearity. An absolute zero value is not obtained by the R-1000. The R-1000 measures total RNA content of each cell and expresses the value as low fluorescence ratio (LFR), medium fluorescence ratio (MFR), and high fluorescence ratio (HFR). The analysis of this ratio resolves the problem of zero reticulocytes: A fraction of less than 0.002 (0.2%) with an LFR of 100% represents aplasia; a shift of the intensity of fluorescence to HFR heralds regeneration. Results of samples stored at room temperature remain stable and within the range of the within-run precision for up to 12 hours, when stored at 5 degrees C for more than 48 hours. The authors conclude that the R-1000 is easy to operate, fulfills the criteria for accuracy and precision, and is highly suitable for daily routine use in a large central hematologic laboratory.\r"

  ".W": "The authors evaluated the analytic and clinical performance of a sensitive radial partition fluorescent enzyme immunoassay for thyrotropin (TSH) performed on Stratus and compared it with a nonsensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. Sensitivity of 0.15 mIU/L was obtained, and precision, specificity, and linearity were acceptable. A good correlation was observed between the two assays in samples from 311 hospitalized patients (r = 0.976). Stratus TSH results were outside the reference range for 20% of clinically euthyroid patients (n = 126), and 2.4% had undetectable levels. The clinically hyperthyroid group (n = 11) with the exception of one patient had TSH values below 0.2 mIU/L. Only 39% of hypothyroid patients on thyroid hormone replacement (n = 74) had TSH values in the reference range, with 38% and 23% exhibiting low and high values, respectively. All untreated primary hypothyroid patients (n = 8) had elevated TSH concentrations. The authors conclude that this sensitive TSH assay is useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism when there is a clinical suspicion but cannot be recommended for thyroid screening in hospitalized patients.\r"

The use of dBASE memo fields provides the integration of word processing and database functions. Preliminary gross examination reports are automatically accompanied by data from former cases on the same patient. Patient demographics, SNOMED codes, and final diagnoses are stored on the fixed disk; complete reports are saved on floppy diskettes. Cases can be retrieved by patient name, surgical number, or SNOMED codes. Daily work lists, frozen section-final diagnosis correlations, turnaround time reports, and listings of incomplete cases are easily obtained. Cytologic results can also be entered, allowing automatic correlation with surgical cases.\r"

The CMI also correlated with mitotic activity (P = 0.01) when the latter was expressed as the percentage of tumor cells actively in mitosis, thus correcting for differences in cellularity between individual tumors. The relationship between cellularity and mitotic activity is discussed.\r"

We matched each case (less than or equal to 24 months of age) with a child of identical sex and age who was seen for well-child care or a minor health problem, and we interviewed an adult caretaker about family history and environmental exposures. Analyzing 58 case-control pairs, we found that home wood-burning stove use, recent respiratory illness exposure, family history of asthma, dirt floors, and lack of running water in the home increased the risk of lower respiratory tract infection. On multiple logistic regression analysis, however, only wood-burning stove use and respiratory illness exposure were independently associated with higher risk.\r"

A total of 164 data pairs were obtained--95 in afebrile children, and 69 in febrile children. The correlation coefficient was .74 for oral-axillary pairs, and .70 for rectal-axillary pairs. The mean difference between oral and axillary temperatures was 1.17 degrees C +/- 0.72 degrees C, and between rectal and axillary temperatures was 1.81 degrees C +/- 0.97 degrees C. Using 37.4 degrees C (greater than or equal to 2 SDs) axillary as the upper limit of normal, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for detecting a fever. The sensitivity was 46%; specificity, 99%; positive predictive value, 97%; and negative predictive value, 72% for combined oral-axillary and rectal-axillary data. It was concluded that axillary temperatures are not sensitive enough to determine a fever when measured with an electronic thermometer. Electronic thermometers should be used to determine oral or rectal temperatures; axillary temperatures may be misleading and should be abandoned in the outpatient setting.\r"

We studied the comparative pharmacokinetics of the following six emergency drugs and solutions: epinephrine hydrochloride, 0.01 mg/kg; sodium bicarbonate, 1 mEq/kg; calcium chloride, 10 mg/kg; hydroxyethyl starch, 10 mL/kg; 50% dextrose in water, 250 mg/kg; and lidocaine hydrochloride, 1 mg/kg. Studies were conducted in normotensive, anesthetized dogs, with three animals studied with each of the drugs or solutions and each animal being treated with all three routes of administration (central intravenous, peripheral intravenous, and intraosseous) in randomized sequence. The effects of epinephrine were also assessed in a shock model. The intraosseous route of administration was comparable with the central and peripheral intravenous routes for all of the emergency drugs and solutions studied, with equivalent magnitudes of peak effect or drug level and equal or longer durations of action. Time to placement of the intraosseous needle varied from 15 seconds to 5 minutes, with a mean of 60 seconds. Time to placement of the needle varies with the skill and experience of the individual. With experience, all individuals could place the intraosseous needle in 60 seconds or less. The intraosseous route is comparable in effect to the central and peripheral intravenous routes of drug administration for epinephrine, sodium bicarbonate, hydroxyethyl starch, calcium chloride, 50% dextrose in water, and lidocaine and is a clinically feasible alternative when intravenous access will be critically delayed.\r"

We analyzed cases of congenital rubella syndrome in infants born from 1970 to 1985 and reported to either one of two independent Centers for Disease Control surveillance systems. Mothers of infants with congenital rubella syndrome identified in both surveillance systems were disproportionately younger than mothers giving birth in the United States. The risk for delivering an infant with congenital rubella syndrome was approximately 2.5 times higher for blacks compared with whites for both reporting systems. A total of 18% of infants with congenital rubella syndrome born since 1979 were Hispanic (national population average, 7%). Both surveillance systems showed that, although primiparous mothers were at highest risk, 39% of women delivering infants affected by congenital rubella syndrome had had at least one previous live birth, suggesting that postpartum immunization could have prevented these congenital rubella syndrome cases. Young, black, and Hispanic primiparous women represent populations at elevated risk for delivering a congenital rubella syndrome-affected infant and should be specifically targeted for immunization.\r"

Simultaneously, 19 healthy term infants were studied. Throughout the study, each neonate received modified 84-kJ/30 mL formula containing no added calciferol. The recommended daily allowance (400 IU) of calciferol was given to each infant as an oral supplement. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone concentrations were monitored biweekly and were normal. Bone mineral content and bone width significantly differed at birth between the term and premature infants. However, by 16 weeks after delivery, the premature infants had exceeded the bone mineral status of the term infants at birth, and their bone mineral content was not significantly lower than that of the term infants. These data indicate improved bone mineralization as compared with previously reported data from very-low-birth-weight neonates.\r"

To evaluate the importance and accuracy of the routine clinical use of fetal echocardiography at our center, a consecutive series of 338 fetal cardiac studies of 323 patients was reviewed. Average gestational age was 24 weeks (range, 17 to 39 weeks). Forty-seven (15%) patients with abnormal conditions were detected. The most common indication for fetal cardiac scan was a family history of congenital heart disease (28%). Other indications were maternal diabetes mellitus (25%), fetal dysrhythmia (14%), other major defect (10%), drug exposure (10%), and obstetrician suspicion of fetal congenital heart disease on routine scan (10%). The highest yield of significant abnormal findings was among those referred for dysrhythmia (31%) and obstetrician suspicion of congenital heart disease (29%). Five fetuses with sustained supraventricular tachycardia and hydrops were successfully treated. The combination of fetal bradycardia and structural heart disease was the most ominous finding. Fifteen (4.6%) patients had clear changes in management based on the fetal echocardiogram. Our experience suggests that the routine use of fetal echocardiography is accurate and an important part of the overall management of the pregnancy considered at risk for producing an infant with congenital heart disease.\r"

Eight-hour cardiorespiratory recordings were visually scanned for the presence of these patterns. Central apnea of 15 seconds or longer was seen in almost half of the infants. The TEB were numerous, and the majority were not associated with central apnea; however, all but five of the apneic episodes that lasted 15 seconds or longer were accompanied by a TEB. Infants spent as much as 40% of their time in periodic breathing. The frequency with which these patterns are seen in healthy premature infants strongly suggests that they are normal findings. Our results do not support the opinion that brief periods of apnea are abnormal when accompanied by a TEB.\r"

Greater use of infant seats was observed in the intervention community (41%) than in the control community (27%) for infants younger than 6 months old. The rate of observed utilization of infants between 7 and 18 months of age increased to 50% on average, but no significant differences were noted between the two communities. These findings suggest that a community-based loan program can produce short-term increases in car seat use rates for infants, even in a low-income community. A strategy to facilitate continued accessibility to such restraints is needed, however, to maintain these improvements.\r"

  ".W": "Injury deaths in Ohio children aged 1 to 16 years account for less than 0.5% of all deaths in the state but 6% of all years of life lost before age 65 years. In this study, injury mortality rates were calculated by sex for three age groups (1 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 16 years) and three population groups (metropolitan white, metropolitan nonwhite, and nonmetropolitan). The 15 metropolitan counties were those with a central city of at least a population of 50,000, containing 60% of the state's population. Fire is the leading cause of injury mortality for metropolitan children aged 1 to 5 years, while motor vehicle injuries and drowning are the leading causes for nonmetropolitan children in this age group. Fire is also the leading cause for metropolitan nonwhite children aged 6 to 11 years, while motor vehicle injuries are the leading cause for nonmetropolitan children, and pedestrian injuries are the leading cause for metropolitan white children. For nonmetropolitan and metropolitan white children aged 12 to 16 years, motor vehicle injuries are the leading cause, while for metropolitan nonwhite children homicide is the leading cause. Excess deaths for each cause were estimated by calculating the number of deaths expected for each age group if the rate experienced by the second-lowest population race group had applied to the whole population in that age group, and comparing this with the observed number. Using this approach, highest priority would be placed on prevention of motor vehicle deaths in 12- to 16-year-old nonmetropolitan and metropolitan white children, of fire deaths in metropolitan nonwhite children aged 1 to 11 years, and of drowning deaths in boys aged 12 to 16 years in all three population groups.\r"

Fifty-one percent of 704 parents of bicycle owners who had not purchased helmets said they had never thought of it, 29% thought helmets were too costly, and 20% felt their children would not wear them. Of 792 children who did not wear helmets, 25% said they did not wear them because their friends did not; 22% never thought about wearing helmets; and 16% found them uncomfortable. Efforts to increase the wearing of helmets should address helmet design, awareness, peer pressure, and cost.\r"

Most injuries occurred indoors (47.0%), on the sidewalk or street (22.5%), or in the residential yard (13.0%). Injuries usually occurred during play (42.3%) or daily activity (32.1%); 1247 (44.0%) involved some sort of fall. Vectors most frequently causing injury were broken glass bottles (15.0%), wooden furniture (12.0%), and asphalt or concrete (11.0%). Broken glass bottles also most frequently inflicted injuries resulting in functional impairment (0.2%), hospitalization (0.9%), or both. Complications were seen in 8% of all lacerations. Our data confirm the importance of injury-prevention strategies aimed at reduction of discarded glass objects (ie, recycling legislation), improved furniture design, and improved municipal services (ie, street repair).\r"

The survey was designed to elicit information about students' general knowledge about anabolic steroids, awareness of the risks and side effects, and the incidence of use of anabolic steroids. Ninety-four (4.4%) of 2113 students admitted using anabolic steroids. Broken down by sex, 67 (6.5%) of 1028 males and 27 (2.5%) of 1085 females were users of steroids. Athletes had a higher use of steroids (79 [5.5%] of 1436 subjects) than nonathletes (15 [2.4%] of 636 subjects). These data suggest that we have another serious, as yet unappreciated drug problem in our adolescents.\r"

Preliminary studies demonstrated that the administration of lovastatin (4 mg/kg body weight [BW] subcutaneously [SC] daily) was effective at lowering plasma cholesterol over a 63-day period, although not to normal values. Subsequently, two groups of rats that had been made nephrotic were studied; one group (n = 8) received lovastatin, the other (n = 9) received the vehicle alone. Blood and urine collections were made at days 0, 23, and 60. Clearance studies and renal histology were obtained at day 60. Lovastatin-treated rats had significantly lower cholesterol at day 23 and 60 than vehicle-treated rats (270.5 +/- 39.7 v 501.7 +/- 81.9 and 148.2 +/- 10.7 v 268.2 +/- 40.8 mg/dL, P less than 0.05). Both groups of rats developed equivalent degrees of proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. At day 60, the lovastatin-treated rats had a lower urea: 18.3 +/- 4.1 v 55.8 +/- 9.6 mmol/L (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] 51.2 +/- 111.5 v 156.2 +/- 27.0 mg/dL, P less than 0.02) and greater unulin clearance (1.83 +/- 0.42 v 0.82 +/- 0.41 mL/min/kg BW, P less than 0.05) than the vehicle-treated rats. Neither group was hypertensive and the blood pressure (BP) was similar in both groups. The percentage of glomeruli showing no changes or minimal histological changes was significantly greater in the lovastatin-treated group (26.5% +/- 5.7% v 8.33% +/- 3.33%, P less than 0.02), and there were more glomeruli with global sclerosis in the vehicle-treated group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were tested for whether serologic studies obtained routinely at biopsy added to clinical diagnostic accuracy. Using history, physical examination, complete blood cell count (CBC), chemistry panel, urinalysis, and urine creatinine and protein, four nephrologists each predicted whether the patient had primary NS (PNS) or secondary NS (SNS), and the most likely histopathologic entity. Six months later, each nephrologist used this information, with results of tests of sera for fluorescent antinuclear antibody (FANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), complement components, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), venereal disease research laboratory serology (VDRI), cryoglobulins and protein electrophoresis (SPEP), with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and protein electrophoresis of the urine (UPEP), to make identical predictions. Histopathology was established by renal biopsy. We analyzed the concordance between nephrologists' choices and biopsy results both before and after serologic tests were available with a kappa statistic. Preserology concordance was moderate (kappa = 0.52), and identical to postserology concordance (kappa = 0.51) for both PNS versus SNS and actual histopathology. Serologies were rarely abnormal without clinical suspicion. These results suggest routine serologic testing does not improve diagnostic accuracy in adult NS.\r"

To assess depression and its possible causes, 57 patients with ESRD treated with hemodialysis (HD, n = 43) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD, n = 14) and 16 patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) were interviewed and completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Illness Effects Questionnaire (IEQ). An ESRD severity coefficient was used to measure chronic illness severity in the patients treated with dialysis, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were used to assess severity of renal disease and adequacy of treatment. A cognitive item subset of the BDI (CDI) was used as a measure of depression. When patients treated with HD and CAPD were compared, CAPD patients were younger, had a shorter duration of dialysis treatment, and less severe medical illness, but the groups did not differ on the IEQ, BDI, or CDI. The IEQ did not correlate with age or disease variables. Both the CDI and the total BDI scores correlated with the IEQ. Perception of illness (IEQ) correlated significantly with cognitive depression for the CAPD and HD patients. For CAPD patients only, a significant correlation between the IEQ and severity of medical illness was obtained. Perception of illness and creatinine concentration were strongly correlated with cognitive depression in the patients with CRI as well. For all renal patients, level of depression was more strongly related to perception of illness than physical illness variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As percent reduction in blood urea concentration during dialysis (PRU) is a function of dialyzer urea clearance, length of dialysis, and urea distribution volume of the patient, it might correlate with Kt/V. Thus, analyzing retrospectively data of 78 studies, we found that the following linear regression equation existed between Kt/V values calculated by means of direct dialysis quantification (DDQ) and PRU values: Kt/V = 0.023 x PRU - 0.284 (r = 0.92). Furthermore, a good correlation existed between Kt/V values measured both by means of DDQ and of the classical algorithm (CA) of the urea kinetic model (UKM) (r = 0.98). Then, a prospective study was started in which 145 Kt/V values calculated by means of the above equation were correlated with the corresponding ones computed by means of a modified algorithm (MA) of UKM, perfectly fitting those generated by CA of UKM. Although the relationship was exponential, it was linear in the clinically important range of PRU between 40% and 70%, corresponding to a Kt/V between 0.64 and 1.33. Furthermore, an excellent correlation (r = 0.96) and no statistically significant difference existed in this range between the two series.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This condition occurs in patients with chronic renal failure and becomes more common with increasing time on renal replacement therapy. Its complications include hemorrhage and tumor formation, which have acquired greater significance as more patients are started on dialysis treatment. The causes of ACKD remain speculative thus far. Its occurrence in nondialyzed patients suggests that dialysis itself is not a necessary factor in its pathogenesis. Five cases of severe unilateral renovascular disease and associated cyst formation are reported. The authors conclude that ACKD may derive from primary renovascular occlusion or from the secondary arterial and arteriolar occlusions seen in the end-stage kidney.\r"

All patients reported as starting treatment for ESRD between 1976 and 1985 (N = 7,404) were evaluated, excluding patients with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or transplantation cases. While patients with ESRD due to diabetes and cystic diseases had lower recovery rates than average, patients with glomerulonephritis associated with a systemic illness, vasculopathies, and crescents had threefold to fourfold higher recovery rates. White race, older age, and later year of ESRD were associated with significantly higher recovery rates. Recovery rates did not differ substantially for patients receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Recovery occurred within 6 months of ESRD in approximately 48% of those recovering, 74% within 1 year, and lasted at least 1 year in 75% of the cases. The authors conclude that caution should be applied when the diagnosis of ESRD is made; the possibility of recovery should be sought and assessed, especially when early renal transplantation is considered.\r"

In addition, one of the biopsied siblings and a third sibling with microscopic hematuria but no renal biopsy apparently had a partial deficiency of the complement regulatory protein, I. The findings in this family may be compatible with the hypothesis that a C4 isotype deficiency and/or a partial deficiency of an individual complement protein allows clinical expression of IgA nephropathy in an individual with a genetic susceptibility for the disease.\r"

The following parameters in glomeruli and in vessels with an outer diameter of 60 microns or less were analyzed by multiple regression analysis: (1) percentage of glomeruli with segmental and/or global sclerosis; (2) percentage of vessel area in renal cortical tissue measured by the point-counting method; (3) index of hyaline change estimated as the percentage of the number of arteries showing hyaline change; (4) index of vessel wall thickness determined by the ratio of mural thickness to outer diameter of arteries; (5) number of vascular cross sections counted per 6.25 microns2. The results of the multiple regression analysis demonstrate that glomerular and vascular sclerosis are interrelated and that hypertension and vessel area are almost equally important as predictors of glomerular sclerosis. Vessel area proved to be an early marker of vasculopathy, as its values in IgAN, even in the absence of hypertension and/or glomerular sclerosis, exceeded those in age- and sex-matched controls (with MCNS). These data, obtained by the use of quantitative methods, establish a role for vessel disease and hypertension in the progression of IgAN.\r"

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A-1 and A-2 were not significantly altered. Renal function and urine protein excretion were not affected by lovastatin. Although one patient developed diarrhea and discontinued treatment before completing 6 weeks of lovastatin, the other 12 patients had no adverse effects. In this short-term study, lovastatin therapy had few side effects and had favorable effects on the lipoprotein profile of nephrotic syndrome patients.\r"

In respect of this principle, testing for minors should not be offered at the request of a third party, and prenatal testing which would result in the birth of a child at increased risk for HD should, where possible, be avoided. If we accede to the wishes of the parents for their children to be tested, we will have broken the primary principles of confidentiality, privacy, and individual justice that are owed to those children. This could be the thin edge of a wedge which could result in adoption agencies, educational institutions, insurance companies, and other third parties demanding genetic testing for another individual. Despite years of careful planning, predictive testing for HD is turning out to be more complex and challenging than ever expected. We need a great deal of care and concern in developing our response to this challenge. Careful long-term assessment and documentation of the impact of such testing is needed, so that the appropriate guidelines can be developed, guidelines which both protect families with HD and at the same time give individuals the opportunity to participate in predictive testing programs.\r"

  ".W": "Major structural rearrangements are uncommon causes of mutation in human genetic diseases. We have previously described that a significant proportion of unrelated patients of western European descent who are deficient in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity have a major structural rearrangement in the LPL gene. Here we report the detailed characterization of this mutation. We show that this rearrangement is due to a duplication of approximately 2 kb which results from juxtaposition of intron 6 to a partially duplicated exon 6. We have sequenced both the junction fragment of this duplication and the corresponding wild-type regions and have found that the breakpoint in intron 6 is associated with the simple repeat found at the 3' end of an Alu element. The breakpoint within exon 6 shows no homology to this simple repeat. This result both suggests that this interchange arose as a nonhomologous recombination event and shows that such events resulting in duplication which occur in normal gene evolution may also lead to genetic disease. Cloning of the junction fragment has allowed synthesis of appropriate primers for rapid screening for this rearrangement in other families with LPL deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Chromosome 13q has been suggested as the site of a gene predisposing to human breast cancer, because loss of heterozygosity of alleles on this chromosome has been observed in some ductal breast tumors and because two breast cancer lines are altered at the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) at 13q14. To test this possibility, linkage of breast cancer susceptibility to 14 loci on chromosome 13q loci was assessed in extended families in which breast cancer is apparently inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. RB1 was excluded as the site of a breast cancer gene by a lod score of Z = -7.60 at close linkage for 13 families. Multipoint analysis yielded negative lod scores throughout the region between 13q12 and 13q34; over most of this distance, Z less than -2.0. Therefore, chromosome 13q appears to be excluded as the site of primary lesion for breast cancer in these families. In addition, comparison of tumor versus normal tissues of nonfamilial breast cancer patients revealed an alteration at the 5' end of RB1 in a mucoid carcinoma but no alterations of RB1 in five informative ductal adenocarcinomas. Linkage data and comparisons of tumor and normal tissues suggest that changes in the RBI locus either are secondary alterations associated with progression of some tumors or occur by chance.\r"

In the present study two families, one with X-linked dominant and one with X-linked recessive AI, were studied by linkage analysis. Eleven cloned RFLP markers of known regional location were used. Evidence was obtained for linkage between the AI locus and the marker p782, defining the locus DXS85 at Xp22, by using two-point analysis. No recombination was scored between these two loci in 15 informative meioses, and a peak lod score (Zmax) of 4.45 was calculated at zero recombination fraction. Recombination was observed between the more distal locus DXS89 and AI, giving a peak lod score of 3.41 at a recombination fraction of .09. Recombination was also observed between the AI locus and the more proximal loci DXS43 and DXS41 (Zmax = 0.09 at theta max = 0.31 and Zmax = 0.61 at theta max = 0.28, respectively). Absence of linkage was observed between the AI locus and seven other loci, located proximal to DXS41 or on the long arm of the X chromosome. On the basis of two-point linkage analysis and analysis of crossover events, we propose the following order of loci at Xp22: DXS89-(AI, DXS85)-DXS43-DXS41-Xcen.\r"

We found eight different RFLP haplotypes at the beta-globin gene cluster in 37 normal persons and in 12 beta-thalassemia heterozygotes from six families. beta-Thalassemia genes in these families associated with two haplotypes only: Mediterranean I and Mediterranean II. There were two different beta-thalassemia mutations segregating in the Portneuf population: an RNA processing mutation (beta+IVS-1,nt110) on haplotype I (five families) and a point mutation leading to chain termination (beta 0 nonsense codon 39) on haplotype II (one family). The distribution of 5' haplotypes on normal beta A Portneuf chromosomes compared with other European populations was most similar to that in British subjects (data for French subjects have not yet been reported). Genealogical reconstructions traced the ancestry of carrier couples to settlers emigrating from several different regions of France to New France in the 17th century. These findings indicate genetic diversity of a greater degree among French-Canadians than recognized heretofore.\r"

  ".W": "Chamberlain et al. have assigned the gene for Friedreich ataxia (FA), a recessive neurodegenerative disorder, to chromosome 9, and have proposed a regional localization in the proximal short arm (9p22-cen), on the basis of linkage to D9S15 and to interferon-beta (IFNB), the latter being localized in 9p22. We confirmed more recently the close linkage to D9S15 in another set of families but found much looser linkage to IFNB. We also reported another closely linked marker, D9S5. Additional families have now been studied, and our updated lod scores are z = 14.30 at theta = .00 for D9S15-FA linkage and z = 6.30 at theta = .00 for D9S5-FA linkage. Together with the recent data of Chamberlain et al., this shows that D9S15 is very likely within 1 cM of the FA locus. We have found very significant linkage disequilibrium (delta Std = .28, chi 2 = 9.71, P less than .01) between FA and the D9S15 MspI RFLP in French families, which further supports the very close proximity of these two loci. No recombination between D9S5 and D9S15 was found in the FA families or Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families (z = 9.30 at theta = .00). Thus D9S5, D9S15, and FA define a cluster of tightly linked loci. We have mapped D9S5 by in situ hybridization to 9q13-q21, and, accordingly, we assign the D9S5, D9S15, and FA cluster to the proximal part of chromosome 9 long arm, close to the heterochromatic region.\r"

Ninety-two cases were obtained by means of a questionnaire sent to over 730 cytogenetic laboratories. Seventy-six cases (75 males and 1 female) had physical examinations after delivery or termination of pregnancy. Among these, there were four significant genital anomalies: three hypospadias and one female with clitoromegaly. Gonadal histology was abnormal in three (27%) of 11 cases, all of whom had normal male external genitalia. Other anomalies were noted in five cases: one cystic hygroma in a male, two cardiac anomalies, one spina bifida with multiple other defects, and one intrauterine growth retardation. There was no relationship between the percent mosaicism and the presence or degree of abnormalities. We conclude that 95% of 45,X/46,XY fetuses will have normal male genitalia, although there will also be a significant risk (27%) for abnormal gonadal histology. Long-term follow-up studies of prenatally diagnosed cases of 45,X/46,XY mosaicism are needed to study, without ascertainment bias, stature, pubertal development, tumor risk, and fertility.\r"

It is further shown that so long as complete indices are available on both parents, using identically partial indices on children will yield nearly undistorted parameter estimates. These conclusions were arrived at by using a special case of the model and may not apply in general.\r"
