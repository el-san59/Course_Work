We have assessed the usefulness of nuclear imaging in 15 children with RND who were evaluated from March 1983 to September 1985. Abnormal findings on 3-phase bone scans were observed in 14 children, with diffusely decreased bone uptake at the symptomatic site being the most common observation. This contrasts sharply with previous reports of diffusely increased uptake in most adults with RND.\r"

The results of this study show that, after isolation from the extracellular matrix, normal and OA chondrocytes in suspension culture are similarly susceptible to the metabolic effects of salicylate. However, chondrocytes from the contralateral knees of dogs with unilateral OA were notably resistant to the effects of salicylate.\r"

  ".U": "89207156\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that erythrocytes from the Milan hypertensive strain of rats (MHS) differ from erythrocytes from the control normotensive strain (MNS). These differences are determined within the stem cells, are genetically associated with the development of hypertension, and are similar to those found between the tubular cells of the two strains. Moreover they seem to be dependent upon the presence of the membrane skeleton proteins. In this paper we describe our studies aimed at identifying some precise protein difference between the membrane skeletons of the two strains, which may cause the cellular differences described above. Milan hypertensive strain and MNS rats were immunized with ghost or membrane skeleton extracts prepared from the other or their own strains. Only MHS rats immunized with MNS ghost or membrane skeleton extracts produced an antibody against a 105 KD protein in about 95% of the animals. This protein has been identified with the recently described cytoskeletal protein adducin on the following bases: the protein binds calmodulin (CaM) and protein kinase C (PKc) in a Ca2+ dependent way. It also binds phosphatidylserine, is the substrate of exogenous PKc, and finally it is purified by high salt extraction of Triton-X100 insoluble erythrocyte cytoskeletons followed by affinity chromatography on CaM-sepharose. Using this antibody the isolation from a mouse spleen library, the characterization and sequencing of a partial cDNA clone coding for this protein has been carried out. In conclusion adducin may be considered a very useful tool to test the hypothesis that the cellular differences between MHS and MNS may be caused by a difference in a membrane skeleton protein.\r"

The two populations were matched for age, sex, body surface area, and systemic arterial pressure. Cardiac output and total peripheral resistances were similar in both groups, with total peripheral resistances increased in comparison to normal values (P less than .001). Patients with EH had a decreased blood volume (P less than .01) with a normal cardiopulmonary blood volume. Patients with RVH had a normal blood volume with an increase in cardiopulmonary blood volume (P less than .02). The para-amino hippurate clearance (CPAH) was decreased in EH. The decrease was similar in the right (160.3 +/- 56.9 mL/min/m2) and left kidneys (158.7 +/- 45 mL/min/m2). The inulin clearance (Cin) was similar in both kidneys (35.2 +/- 12.5 v 33.6 +/- 11.6 mL/min/m2). In addition, in EH, CPAH was negatively correlated with blood pressure (P less than .01). In patients with RVH, CPAH of the \"stenotic\" kidney was reduced (91.5 +/- 47.8 mL/min/m2) as well as Cin (22.9 +/- 9.3 mL/min/m2). In contrast a significant increase in CPAH (194.1 +/- 63.8 mL/min/m2) and Cin (47.6 +/- 12.6 mL/min/m2) was observed in the contralateral kidney. Kidney function (CPAH and Cin) was not correlated with blood pressure in the \"stenotic\" kidney. The CPAH and Cin of the nonstenotic kidney were positively and significantly correlated with systemic arterial pressure (P less than .001). The Cin was positively correlated with CPAH in all kidneys in RVH or in EH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aim of this study was to compare 24-hour urinary albumin excretion in a group of normotensives, borderline, and untreated mild hypertertensives and to assess, in a subgroup of them, the possible relations between microalbuminuria and arterial blood pressure. Fifteen normotensives, 16 borderline, and 19 mild hypertensive patients were studied. Slightly but significantly higher values of microalbuminuria were observed in the mild hypertensives compared to the other two groups. In 21 borderline and mild hypertensive patients 24-hour microalbuminuria was related to casual blood pressure and noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A significant correlation was found between microalbuminuria and average day-time diastolic blood pressure. Our data suggest that albumin excretion is slightly increased in mild arterial essential hypertension; the direct association between microalbuminuria and arterial diastolic blood pressure during daily activities seems to confirm a pathophysiological link between transcapillary protein escape and arterial blood pressure that warrants further studies.\r"

  ".U": "89207166\r", 
  ".W": "Seven ACE inhibitors were studied for possible differences in distribution to aorta, brain, heart, lung, and kidney after administration of single oral doses to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Doses, normalized for differences in inhibitory potency and molecular weight, were expected to deliver equivalent levels of ACE-inhibitory activity to the circulation, and this was confirmed by preliminary dose-response studies. The relative potencies of the active moieties of the seven drugs and the normalized oral doses used were: SQ 29,852 (1.0), 100 mg/kg; captopril (3.5), 30 mg/kg; enalapril (12), 20 mg/kg; fosinopril (13), 25 mg/kg; zofenopril (20), 10 mg/kg; lisinopril (24), 10 mg/kg; and ramipril (51), 5 mg/kg. In these ex vivo studies, ACE activities were determined fluorometrically in SHR sera and in uncentrifuged homogenates of the solid tissues at various times after oral dosing with the ACE inhibitors. As expected, the normalized oral doses of the seven inhibitors had equivalent effects on serum ACE. In lung, where ACE has a vascular endothelial localization, and in aorta, where ACE inhibition correlates with antihypertensive action, ramipril, lisinopril, and zofenopril were distinguished by the magnitude and duration (three to four days) of their effects. In the brain, where ACE may affect central regulation of blood pressure and participate in the degradation of certain neuropeptides, ramipril and enalapril had no effect; captopril and zofenopril had modest, short-lasting effects, and fosinopril, lisinopril, and SQ 29,852 had delayed but long-lasting inhibitory actions. In the kidney, where ACE inhibition may have positive or negative effects on renal function, ramipril and fosinopril could be distinguished by their weak actions, perhaps associated with biliary routes of excretion. In the heart, where ACE inhibitors may prevent ischemic damage to the myocardium, single oral doses of captopril, fosinopril, and particularly zofenopril produced striking and long-lasting inhibition, whereas equivalent doses of ramipril and enalapril produced barely detectable inhibition.\r"

The specimens were obtained from 23 clinically healthy infants and compared with those from 43 infants with recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM). Potentially pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 61% of the control subjects and 90% of those with RAOM. Infants with RAOM had about as extensive alterations as the healthy ones. A single healthy child and one with RAOM had what was interpreted as a normal nasal mucosa; all others showed reduced frequencies of ciliated cells, deformation of cilia, extensive loss of normal mucosal epithelium, and metaplasia in their nasal epithelial lining. Severely damaged area could be seen close to more normal ones. Nasal mucosa in clinically healthy infants rarely had a normal appearance, probably due to frequent infections and the fairly long time needed for the repair process. We proposed that the high frequency of damaged, incompletely healed nasal mucosa may constitute an important factor with regard to the susceptibility to further infections.\r"

We examined ET function in the active and convalescent stages of OME in a total of 103 children (141 ears) and compared the results with those obtained in a control group of 34 ears. There were 27 children (33 ears) with OME in the convalescent stage and 76 children (108 ears) in the group with active OME. The test of ET function included the inflation-deflation test and dye clearance test. No cases of abnormally high tubal opening pressure were found in the convalescent OME group, and only 11% of ETs in the active OME group had high pressure. Negative middle ear pressure equalizing function, which was impaired in 97.2% of ETs in the active OME group, was still found to be impaired in 93.9% of ETs in the convalescent OME group. Eustachian tube clearance was impaired in 64.0% of ears with OME in the active stage; this percentage decreased considerably to 36.0% in ears in the convalescent stage of OME. We conclude that poor ability to equalize negative pressure is a fundamental deficit of ET function in OME; impaired clearance function of ET in the active stage of OME is not considered to be a primary cause of OME; there is almost no organic obstruction or stenosis of the ET in patients with OME.\r"

Morphological evidence suggests that these layers participate in absorption and secretion of substances to and from the inner ear. A comparison of morphological features of round window membranes suggests that the average thickness of 70 microns does not change with advancing age. However, in the elderly, the connective tissue has a looser arrangement; there is an increase in ground substance; and elastic fibers thicken. Fibroblast nuclei become larger, rounder, and less uniform and have extensions. The ultrastructure of the \"false round window membranes,\" with epithelial cells of the same type bounding both sides, suggests that these membranes consist of juxtaposed epithelial folds of the overlying promontory.\r"

A nonsyndromal autosomal recessive type of profound childhood deafness was thought to be the cause of deafness in at least eight and probably 12 children from a large family with various consanguineous matings and other family interrelations. Audiograms of all affected deaf children showed a profound childhood deafness with only a very slight variation. Audiometric examinations, such as pure-tone audiometry, high-frequency audiometry, stapedial reflexes, and Bekesy audiometry, of ten obligate or presumed carriers did not show any significant findings that would allow identification of carriers of this autosomal recessive gene. Families like this one seem to be very rare. Large clinically well-studied families like this one are indispensable for gene linkage studies of nonsyndromal autosomal recessive types of profound childhood deafness. Such studies should make it possible to trace the origin of these types of childhood deafness at an early age. In consequence, carrier detection should also become available.\r"

Twenty-six patients, aged 3 months through 16 years, were studied. Initial measurements were obtainable in all but two patients; they were successfully tested on a second attempt. All subsequent patient testing efforts were completed, for an overall successful test rate of 95%. Waveform amplitude and morphology were consistent with adult values, except in infants. The most clinically helpful use of this test was to objectively assess facial nerve function, once spontaneous motion was lost in acquired paralysis or if it had never been seen in congenital paralysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the \"normal\" side of the face proved most informative for three patients. Use of the test as an absolute predictor for return of function is not possible; however, the ENoG results add data that can be incorporated into the clinical information to make such predictions more rational. We conclude that ENoG can be performed on children, and that the measurements, within bounds of interpretation, can offer objective data not usually available in this age population.\r"

The type of defect, depending on the level of invasion by the cancer, should be classified as partial pharyngeal, circumferential pharyngeal, or pharyngoesophageal. Within each class, the surgeon can have his preference for a reconstructive procedure according to available expertise and familiarity. In our series of 97 patients with pharyngoesophageal defects resulting from resection of laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, and cervical esophageal cancers, the patch-on pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, the tubed pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, and the stomach were used for the three types of defects, respectively. Mortality and morbidity, while kept at an acceptable level, appear to rise as the complexity of the procedure increases. This supports the argument that the reconstructive method should be selected with reference to the type of defect, which is in turn dependent on the site and behavior of the tumor. The reconstructive procedure is to fit the defect, and not vice versa.\r"

The accuracy of the clinical vs CT staging for laryngeal carcinomas was 58.8% vs 70.6%, whereas the accuracy of the staging by combination of the two modalities was 88.2%. Combined staging modalities showed the same accuracy for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinomas (88.2%), whereas clinical staging accuracy for hypopharyngeal carcinomas was lower (52.9%) and CT accuracy was higher (82.4%) than that observed for laryngeal carcinomas. In the majority of the cases that were staged inaccurately, the error was one of under-estimation: in particular, tumors confined to the mucosa and early infiltration of laryngeal fat spaces were not detected by CT.\r"

Fifteen children (5 month-8 yr) breathed spontaneously and 10 (4 month-9 yr) underwent mechanical ventilation. Tidal volume and rate of ventilation were, respectively, 3.5-6.6 ml kg-1 and 22-46 b.p.m. in spontaneously breathing supine children, and 8.3-15 ml kg-1 and 20-30 b.p.m. in mechanically ventilated supine children, and did not differ significantly in the lateral position. There was no significant change in compliance when the child was turned to the lateral position, but FRC increased from 22 (SD7) to 25 (8) ml kg-1 (P less than 0.01) in the spontaneously breathing group and from 19 (6) to 24 (8) ml kg-1 (P less than 0.01) in the other group. In spontaneously breathing children, PCD and SBAME indicated a somewhat impaired pulmonary gas mixing (P less than 0.05) after the child had been turned to the lateral position, but no change occurred in the other group. These findings suggest that the distribution of ventilation in anaesthetized children in the lateral position is similar to that reported previously in anaesthetized adults.\r"

  ".W": "Aspiration of gastric contents, the most common anaesthetic cause of maternal mortality, is decreased by emptying of the stomach and the use of antacids and H2-receptor antagonists. One hundred and eighty-three mothers presenting for emergency Cesarean section were allocated to three groups. In group 1, the stomach was emptied before operation via an orogastric tube and thereafter 30 ml of sodium citrate 0.3 mol litre-1 was ingested 5-15 min before induction of general anaesthesia (our usual practice). Group 2 received only 30 ml of sodium citrate 0.3 mol litre-1. Group 3 received ranitidine 50 mg i.v. before operation, 5-15 min before induction of anaesthesia, in addition to sodium citrate. Our results show that preoperative gastric emptying with an orogastric tube followed by sodium citrate is preferred if anaesthesia should be induced 15-20 min later. However, the use of ranitidine and sodium citrate is preferred at subsequent times. Although our data show that preoperative gastric emptying decreased the mean intragastric volumes before Caesarean section, the number of patients at risk of acid aspiration was not reduced. In view of these findings and the unpleasantness of orogastric intubation, we suggest that routine preoperative gastric aspiration via an orogastric tube is not justified, although the manoeuvre should still be used following a recent meal.\r"

Corrections were made for changes in tissue blood contents, using chromium-51 as a red cell marker. In control animals the mean brain:blood ratio was 0.038 (range 0.027-0.052). Following arabinose there was a five-fold increase in mean BBB permeability (mean brain:blood ratio 0.192 (0.070-0.378)). There was no change after hypertension and carbon dioxide (mean ratio 0.034) or after hypotension (mean ratio 0.032), despite an increase in cerebral extracellular potassium. Examination of other tissues showed no change in the 99mTcO4- tissue/blood partition in heart muscle in any study but, following hypotension, ratios in the kidney (mean ratio 1.63) and, to a lesser extent, the liver (mean ratio 1.37) had increased, suggesting an abnormality of active transport under these conditions. We conclude that, while 99mTcO4- tissue/blood partitioning revealed osmotic disruption of the BBB, profound hypotension with evidence of brain cell damage did not change BBB permeability to the same marker. Hypotension may influence active transport of this ion in liver and kidney.\r"

The values in the literature vary, often quoted without reference to measurement or identification as Ostwald or Bunsen coefficients. We used a Scholander apparatus and determined the Bunsen solubility coefficient (mlgas.(mlfluid.atmosphere)-1) at 37 degrees C as: 0.476 in water; 0.673 in human whole blood; 0.479 in human plasma; 0.662 in canine whole blood; 0.437 in canine plasma; and 1.077 in homogenized canine lung tissue. As pure freon was used, these solubilities may not be applicable if freon-22 does not obey Henry's law. In man, the Ostwald solubility coefficient is calculated as 0.76 ml/ml whole blood at BTPS. These results provide information for further studies involving freon-22, and clear the confusion which has arisen from poorly defined solubility coefficients.\r"

Animals were killed 6 h later. A second series of 16 were treated identically, but were killed after 24 h. Measurements were made of fluoride concentrations in serum, liver and urine (indicators of biotransformation of enflurane), paracetamol concentrations in urine, pathological changes in liver samples, and concentrations of the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in serum. Pretreatment with paracetamol significantly decreased urinary fluoride at 6 and 24 h after exposure to enflurane, but decreased fluoride concentrations in serum and liver only at 6 h after exposure to enflurane. Paracetamol concentrations in urine did not change after exposure to enflurane. Exposure to paracetamol alone increased AST and ALT. At 24 h after exposure to enflurane, serum concentrations of enzymes in rats pretreated with paracetamol were similar to those of control rats. Pretreatment with paracetamol may therefore inhibit metabolism of enflurane. Although no hepatic damage was observed, the increased in AST and ALT suggested subclinical liver damage in rats given only paracetamol.\r"

There was highly significant variation in detected minimum saturation between the instruments (P less than 0.001). One instrument failed to detect the full extent of desaturation under the experimental conditions and was more likely to fail completely to detect desaturation than the other test instruments when influenced by vasoconstriction (P less than 0.05). Significant impairment in the performance of all the instruments tested occurred in the presence of normal pulse signals. The duration of detected reductions in oxygen saturation was not significantly affected.\r"

The collagen fibres of the inner collagenous zone in young eyes formed a tightly interwoven membrane, and the meshes were regular and fine.

Injection of a highly purified lipid-free rhodopsin preparation provokes severe chorioretinitis with concomitant anterior uveitis. The onset of disease is earlier, its frequency is higher, and the inflammation is considerably more severe than in EAU induced under similar conditions by opsin. The first inflammatory cells are observed in the ciliary body and pars plana. Within a few days the inflammation extends into the anterior chamber, choroid, and retina. Retinitis predominates in the central area, while chorioretinitis is observed in the periphery, both accompanied by damage to and elimination of the photoreceptor cells. The monkeys develop high cellular and humoral immune responses against rhodopsin and opsin. The cellular response maximum just precedes the onset of EAU. This may indicate that cellular immunity has an important role in the pathogenesis of rhodopsin-induced EAU.\r"

To examine this possibility we identified 51 allopurinol users and compared their lenses with those of 76 patients who did not use allopurinol. The existence of lens opacities and the level of visual acuity were assessed by review of medical records or by prospective ophthalmic examinations; in both phases of the study the examiners were blinded as to the patient's use or non-use of allopurinol. Three different outcomes were considered: formation of any cataract, formation of a posterior subcapsular cataract, and formation of a cataract contributing to a corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or worse. The risk ratio for the formation of any cataract was 1.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.8, 2.0), the risk ratio for the formation of a posterior subcapsular cataract was 0.9 (0.3, 2.0), and the risk ratio for the formation of a cataract contributing to a loss of visual acuity was 1.3 (0.6, 2.9). None of these risk ratios was changed appreciably after controlling for age, sex, hypertension, or diabetes. Thus, after a mean of 6.9 years of allopurinol use, we found no evidence to confirm that allopurinol users were at higher risk of acquiring cataracts.\r"

This is a retrospective study of the results of primary trabeculectomy in 21 consecutive eyes of 15 patients with congenital glaucoma. Eighteen of 13 patients' eyes were controlled after a single trabeculectomy and remained controlled after a mean follow-up of 3.9 years (range 1.5 to 6.7 years). The role of primary trabeculectomy in congenital glaucoma merits further consideration.\r"

Twenty-five eyes (89%) had a final visual acuity of 6/18 or better. The remaining three eyes (11%) had severely reduced vision attributable to complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (traction retinal detachment involving the macula in two eyes and ischaemic maculopathy and a persistent vitreous haemorrhage in the third). Large amounts of confluent argon laser photocoagulation may be necessary for the elimination of new vessels in some patients, and it is our view that laser photocoagulation should be continued until regression of new vessels occurs. This is compatible with the retention of functional vision and good visual acuity.\r"

With the theoretical method and the preoperative data the refraction was on the average 0.72 D (SD 0.78) more myopic than expected, an error which could be corrected for by (1) substituting the assumed postoperative chamber depth by the actual mean value and (2) adding 0.16 mm to the preoperative axial length. With the postoperative data the error was 0.05 D (SD 0.78) (p greater than 0.05). By the SRK method the refraction was 0.15 D (SD 0.71) and 0.37 D (SD 0.69) more hyperopic than expected with the pre- and the postoperative data respectively. These offset errors could be corrected for in either case by adjusting the assumed A constant in the SRK formula. With appropriate empirical corrections for offset errors the theoretical and the SRK method were similar in accuracy, that is, about 82% of the predictions within +/- 1 D, 99% within +/- 2 D, and 100% within +/- 3 D error. The variation in postoperative refraction after computerised IOL calculation was about one-third of the variation previously seen after implantation of standard power IOL.\r"

Plateau and bagging taken together are strongly associated with climatic keratopathy (and by inference with reflected ultraviolet exposure), weakly associated with exfoliation syndrome, inversely related to the degree of cataract, and interfere severely with vision.\r"

TNF was assayed by a well established bioassay which depends upon cytolysis of particular tumour cell lines and which has a limit of detection of c. 25 pg/ml. Of the 92 joint fluids tested (70 rheumatoid and 22 others) only three had demonstrable TNF activity. Despite this, joint fluid cells from all 14 patients tested (12 rheumatoid and two others) had the ability to synthesize TNF on stimulation in vitro. Subsequently it was shown that joint fluids contain a macromolecule which inhibits TNF activity in cytolytic assays and which may mask low levels of TNF activity in joint fluids.\r"

  ".W": "In a group of 19 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with normal renal function, serum levels of aluminium (AlS) were monitored during treatment with drugs containing this metal (Al). The AlS levels during treatment were significantly higher (0.005 less than p less than 0.01) than those before treatment, i.e. 19.4 (SEM 2.3) micrograms/l and 12.3 (1.7), respectively. This increase in AlS was significantly (0.025 less than p less than 0.05) correlated with the pretreatment serum creatinine level (mean value for the whole group 80.5 (SEM 4.7) mumol/l) but showed no correlation with the predicted creatinine clearance. Although the increase in AlS during therapy with A1 containing drugs is not dramatic in RA patients with normal renal function, the rheumatologist should be aware of the risk of increased AlS concentration in RA patients, especially those with impaired renal function.\r"

This study aimed to explore the profile of P-3-NP in patients with SS and Raynaud's phenomenon, a common forerunner of the disease. Using a radioimmunoassay, the mean level for P-3-NP was found to be raised in SS compared with both the control (p less than 0.001) and Raynaud's groups (p less than 0.001). Analysis of serial samples from the patients with SS suggested that the P-3-NP level reflected changing clinical activity. Three groups emerged: a group with stable disease which showed a less than 20% change in P-3-NP level (mean 5.7%); a group with increasing activity which showed an increase of greater than 20% (mean 35.8%) and a group of decreasing activity which showed a decrease of greater than 20% (mean 33.6%). These data suggest that there is an increase in collagen metabolism in SS and that changes in P-3-NP levels may reflect the clinical course of the disease.\r"

None of the green/blue losses correlated significantly with spatiotemporal losses while between 2 and 8 cycles/deg 11/12 spatiotemporal conditions showed significant correlations with red/green colour loss.

Verbal and visuospatial imagery tasks were compared with tasks in the same modality that did not demand the formation of visual images. In the verbal part, memorizing of word pairs was tested for abstract words, concrete words without imagery instruction, and concrete words with imagery instruction. In the visuospatial part, three tests required the evaluation of spatial features of imagined letters. In one of them mental rotations had to be performed in the exploration of the imagined stimulus. The visuospatial control tasks tested the ability to judge the position of perceived dots and mentally to rotate a seen mannekin. The pattern of results was determined mainly by the differential sensitivity of visuospatial and verbal tasks to right and left brain damage, respectively. Multidimensional scaling of correlations between test results did not show a close relationship between the results of verbal and visuospatial imagery tasks, but suggested that brain damage affected visuospatial imagery tasks differentially from visuospatial control tasks. Analysis of single cases showed that patients with lesions of the left temporo-occipital region failed to benefit from the imagery instruction in the memorizing of concrete words. These patients could nonetheless solve correctly the visuospatial imagery tasks. Possibly this dissociation is due to differences in the amount or the quality of information conveyed by the visual images rather than to the verbal or visuospatial mode of processing to which the images are subjected.\r"

Three subjects regained the ability to explicitly identify briefly presented words; these subjects were more accurate with nouns than functors and words of high as compared with low imageability. Additionally, these subjects were impaired in the processing of suffixes. These data are not accommodated by the 'disconnection' account of pure alexia but are more consistent with the hypothesis that reading in these patients is mediated by the right hemisphere.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a voluntary contraction on the H reflexes of various muscles were quantified to determine whether the reflex responses were sufficiently reproducible to be used in diagnostic studies. During a voluntary contraction, H reflexes could be recorded reliably from tibialis anterior and abductor pollicis brevis, but accurate identification of the onset of the H wave from the on-going background EMG required duplicate averages of multiple responses. During a contraction the H reflex could be obtained at lower stimulus intensities in the forearm flexor muscles than when relaxed, and a more clear separation of the H wave from the M wave was possible. The background contraction abolished the attenuation of reflex amplitude with increasing stimulus repetition rates, such that repetition rates of up to 4 Hz could be used without significant loss of reflex amplitude. There were only small and usually insignificant differences in the latency of the H reflex or its variability when elicited with the forearm muscles relaxed and when flexor carpi radialis was contracting steadily. The reflex latencies of abductor pollicis brevis, tibialis anterior and soleus were compared with F wave latencies for these muscles. The minimal F wave latencies were shorter than the H reflex latencies for abductor pollicis brevis (mean 2.2 ms) and tibialis anterior (mean 1.0 ms) but not for soleus. Comparison of the spread of F wave latencies (F max-F min) suggests that, for soleus, F waves are recorded only from the faster conducting motor units in the pool, presumably those less readily recruited in the H reflex. It was calculated that the distribution of motor conduction velocities responsible for the F waves of abductor pollicis brevis was 8.8 m.s-1. This value underestimates the likely distribution of motor conduction velocities for the thenar muscle by as much as 50%, consistent with the view that F waves rarely occur in slowly conducting motor units, the units of lowest threshold in reflex studies. It is concluded that, for many motoneuron pools, the H reflex and the F wave appear preferentially in different motoneurons, low and high threshold, respectively, and that reflex studies can provide information not available from somatosensory evoked potentials or F wave studies.\r"

  ".W": "Epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin) is a new anthracycline cytostatic, which was synthesized in an effort to find an agent with an improved therapeutic effect on human malignant tumours combined with reduced myocardial toxicity. Animal experiments have previously shown that the parent drug doxorubicin, besides being a myocardial toxin, may cause nerve cell lesions both in the central and the peripheral nervous system. Intravenously (i.v.) injected doxorubicin passes into regions of the nervous system located outside the blood-brain barrier (BBB); the drug accumulates in the nucleus of neurons and causes cell degeneration. This investigation was performed to establish whether epirubicin, given as a single i.v. injection in the mouse, could enter the central nervous system (CNS) and cause neurotoxic effects. Epirubicin was found to emit a primary orange fluorescence in thin frozen sections. Detectable amounts of epirubicin could not be seen in regions protected by the BBB. The choroid plexus and all the circumventricular brain regions with the exception of the subcommissural organ showed the presence of the drug in the parenchyma and a marked accumulation in cell nuclei. Severe cellular changes were found in these regions by light and electron microscopy and the alterations were most marked in mice with the longest survival period (45 days). The animals also developed a progressive sensory polyneuropathy and appeared lethargic. Epirubicin given as a single i.v. injection in the mouse will thus spread into brain regions lacking a BBB where it produces toxic lesions in the same way as previously reported for the parent compound, doxorubicin.\r"

  ".W": "Lateral visually-guided saccades were studied electro-oculographically in 40 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in order to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of the oculomotor syndrome and the suprareticular control of saccades. In the two main paradigms used, the central fixation point was removed just before the appearance of a lateral target, the subject being told either to look at the target (gap task) or, particularly to test frontal lobe influence, in the direction opposite to the target (antisaccade task). Saccade latency distribution in the gap task was significantly more scattered in patients as compared with 40 normal control subjects, although mean latencies did not differ greatly. In particular, many patients had latencies shorter or longer than those of control subjects. In the PSP group, the percentage of errors in the antisaccade task (misdirected saccades made towards the target) was strongly correlated with latency in the gap task, high percentages of errors corresponding to short latencies. There was also a correlation between latency and the frontal dysfunction evaluated by neuropsychological tests. These correlations suggest that short latencies could result from a severe impairment of the frontal inhibitory system involved in saccade initiation. Long latencies would result from damage to diverse excitatory suprareticular pathways (such as the superior colliculus) or to circuits responsible for shifts in visual attention. Lastly, 20 patients were followed longitudinally (for 3-12 months). The initially great intersubject variability of saccade latency in the gap task significantly decreased over a period of several months. This finding could result from a secondary balance between the impairment of the frontal inhibitory system and that of the diverse excitatory pathways.\r"

In the control group both the early, frontal-maximum, and the later vertex-maximum, components of the contingent negative variation (CNV) were larger on GO than NO-GO trials. In the patients, the early frontal CNV wave did not differentiate GO and NO-GO trials, and the late CNV showed a smaller separation between these trial types than did the late CNV of the control group. These CNV abnormalities may reflect impairments in selectively orienting to salient stimuli, and in differential response preparation. Such impairments might in turn reflect the damage to the frontal lobes and/or their connections that commonly occurs as a result of closed head injury.\r"

Sixty-two percent of the patients showed contrast sensitivity loss in at least one eye for horizontal or vertical stimulus orientation. Visual perception was distorted in a qualitatively different way according to the anteroposterior site of the lesion. Patients with occipital or occipitotemporal lesions showed high spatial frequency selective losses and patients with temporal or parietal lesions low frequency selective losses. Stimulus orientation selectivity was observed in patients with lesions of the primary visual cortex as well as in patients with lesions anterior to the striate cortex. Contrast sensitivity orientation-selective losses were demonstrated in 14 of the 17 'affected' eyes.\r"

  ".W": "Immunocytochemistry with antibodies against cytoskeletal proteins has been used to search for molecular differences in the spinal cord from patients with motor neuron disease (MND) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type and normal spinal cord. Monoclonal antibodies which recognize phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes diffusely labelled a proportion of normal and MND anterior horn cells, but did not permit differentiation between normal and MND tissue. However, in some MND and control anterior horn cells, dense 'floccular' accumulations were labelled by antibodies recognizing phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes. These accumulations of phosphorylated neurofilaments suggest abnormalities of cytoskeletal regulation, but were neither a common nor a specific feature of MND. Axonal spheroids, which were as common in normal as in MND tissue, were labelled by all antineurofilament antibodies. Normal-appearing axons, but not spheroids, in MND and control tissue were identified by an antiactin antibody, indicating that actin may be absent from the cytoplasmic domain which gives rise to spheroids. In summary, we have not found specific posttranslational changes of cytoskeletal proteins in MND and, in particular, phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes are common to both MND and control anterior horn cells.\r"

To ensure patient control throughout this multifaceted process, we have developed an integrated approach to obtaining consent for DNA sampling at each level of participation. Movement from one level to another is reflected in the choices offered to participants. This inclusive approach is based on the underlying principle of informed consent, namely the respect for individuality, confidentiality and freedom of choice. This approach should help practitioners of medical genetics recognize the medical context of DNA sampling.\r"

We audited the practices of 120 randomly selected family physicians in Ontario, who were separated into four groups: nonmembers of the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC), members of the CFPC with no certification in family medicine, certificated members without residency training in family medicine and certificated members with residency training in family medicine. The practices were assessed according to predetermined criteria for charting, procedures in periodic health examination, quality of medical care and use of indicator drugs. Generally the scores were significantly higher for CFPC members with residency training in family medicine than for those in the other groups, nonmembers having the lowest scores. Patient questionnaires indicated no difference in satisfaction with specific aspects of care between the four groups. Self-selection into residency training and CFPC membership may account for some of the results; nevertheless, the findings support the contention that residency training in family medicine should be mandatory for family physicians.\r"

In a group of 17 patients, mean aortic valve area 0.75 cm2, the average time to cross the aortic valve was 2 minutes 45 seconds and the median time 30-40 seconds. Once the proper size catheter was selected, the average time to cross was 59 seconds. The success of this catheter is based on the operator's ability to \"scan\" or interrogate the surface of the valve thoroughly by manipulating the catheter and a moveable core straight tip guidewire.\r"

Patients also received subsequent doses of a similar volume of 0.375 per cent bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 up to four times a day for a maximum duration of seven days. Good pain relief was achieved in patients who underwent lateral and posterior thoracotomies. No pain relief was achieved in patients who underwent anterior thoracotomy or in patients in whom there was excessive bleeding in the pleural space. Bupivacaine blood concentrations were measured in 11 patients following the initial dose of 20 ml of 0.5 per cent bupivacaine (with epinephrine 1:200,000 in five of the 11 patients). The mean peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine when used with epinephrine was 0.32 +/- 0.02 microgram.ml-1. The mean peak plasma concentrations of bupivacaine when used without epinephrine was 1.28 +/- 0.48 microgram.ml-1. Our present data show that intrapleural analgesia is useful in the management of postoperative pain in patients who undergo thoracotomy. Our data also show that there is a significant decrease in peak plasma concentrations of bupivacaine when epinephrine is added to the solution (P less than 0.05).\r"

Neuromuscular block was quantified by single twitches evoked at 0.1 Hz. The changing nature of neuromuscular block from Phase I to Phase II was monitored periodically by train-of-four fade. In the absence of succinylcholine, ketamine had no consistent neuromuscular effect of its own. In the presence of succinylcholine, ketamine in a dose-dependent manner potentiated both the Phase I and the Phase II neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. In Phase I, 2 mg.kg-1 of ketamine reduced the ED50 of succinylcholine from 0.46 +/- 0.07 mg.kg-1 to 0.33 +/- 0.06 mg.kg-1 (P less than 0.01), and increased its 25-75 per cent recovery index from 4.0 +/- 0.4 min to 5.3 +/- 0.1 min (P less than 0.01). In Phase II, ketamine in the same dose deepened a steady neuromuscular block maintained by succinylcholine infusion from 48 +/- 3 per cent block to 71 +/- 2 per cent block (P less than 0.01). We concluded that ketamine potentiates the Phase I and the Phase II neuromuscular blocks of succinylcholine.\r"

In Group I (n = 60) readiness for transfer from OR to PARR was decided clinically. In Group II (n = 50) additional criteria of oxygen saturation (SaOe) greater than or equal to 98 per cent with end-tidal gas N2O less than or equal to 10 per cent and CO2 less than or equal to 45 mmHg were met. A higher incidence of desaturation (SaO2 less than or equal to 90 per cent) occurred in Group I (27 per cent) than in Group II (eight per cent) (P less than 0.05). More children under 2 yr desaturated in Group I (50 per cent) than Group II (17 per cent) (P greater than 0.05 less than 0.10). Twenty-two patients in each group had a recent history of upper respiratory tract infections. In these patients, desaturation was more marked in those in Group I (32 per cent) than in Group II (five per cent) (P less than 0.05). Within each group, the incidence of desaturation during transport was similar in patients with or without a recent URI.\r"

Both groups of patients had significant postoperative changes in peak expiratory flow rate, expiratory reserve volume and vital capacity; forced expiratory volume at one second was not significantly changed in either group. There were no significant differences in the pre- or postoperative mechanics between the two groups. We conclude that general anaesthestics do not play a significant role in the generation of abnormalities in postoperative spirometry.\r"

Groups had been predetermined by date of birth. During the first 24 hours after the operation no difference was found at any time in the incidence or severity of emesis among the groups. The overall incidence of emesis during the first 24 hours postoperatively was 54, 48 and 52 per cent, in groups A, B and C, respectively. It is concluded that nitrous oxide does not increase the incidence of emesis after isoflurane anaesthesia and that isoflurane and enflurane anaesthesia are associated with similar incidences of nausea and vomiting after gynaecological laparoscopy.\r"

The objective of this study was to observe the effect of fentanyl on the rat striatal catechol oxidation current (CA.OC) which reflects extracellular DOPAC (3-4,dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) concentration (a major metabolite of dopamine), as measured by in vivo voltammetry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, anaesthetized with halothane, were stereotaxically implanted with carbon fibre electrodes in the striatum and after an initial stabilization period of an hour were given a control saline IV injection followed 30 min later by fentanyl 10 micrograms.kg-1 IV over 10 min and at 70 min by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline 70 mg.kg-1 IP. Fentanyl produced a significant (P less than 0.05 Anova) increase in CA.OC in all animals. This reached a plateau 15 min following the administration of fentanyl and was at a maximum of 148 +/- 10.2 per cent of control 35 min after the administration of fentanyl. Pargyline produced a rapid decline in CA.OC peak height which went from 143 +/- 11.6 to 39 +/- 6.8 per cent of control over 30 min. There were no significant differences between the pH, PaO2 and PaCO2 during the saline and fentanyl injection periods and there was no significant variation of blood pressure throughout the experiment. This study shows that under stable physiological conditions, fentanyl produces a significant increase in CA.OC in the rat striatum.\r"

FAP-PT is a disease with multiple clinical manifestations which include disturbances of sensibility, progressive paresis starting in the lower extremities, autonomic dysfunction, cardiac conduction disturbances, gastro-intestinal disorders, nephrotic syndrome, sexual and sphincter disorders, extreme emotionalism and apprehension. Several intermingling problems have to be considered in the anaesthetic management of each individual case. In our patient a sinus dysrhythmia resolved after isoflurane and this seems to be a good choice for general anaesthesia in patients with FAP-PT, if they are in an early stage of heart involvement.\r"

During anaesthesia for intracranial aneurysm surgery, we prospectively compared haemodynamic values obtained from 13 patients being treated with nicardipine HCl (0.15 mg.kg-1.hr-1 IV) for cerebral vasospasm against values obtained from 11 untreated controls. Prior to induction of anaesthesia, nicardipine-treated patients had significantly elevated mean +/- SD cardiac index (5.67 +/- 1.30 vs 3.99 +/- 0.73 L.min-1.m-2) while MAP (86 +/- 10 vs 99 +/- 14 mmHg) and systemic vascular resistance (647 +/- 227 vs 1141 +/- 404 dynes.sec-1.cm-5) were reduced. Heart rate, CVP, and PACWP were similar between groups. Anaesthesia induction and tracheal intubation resulted in similar haemodynamic values between groups with the exception of CVP (10 +/- 5 vs 5 +/- 2 mmHg) and PACWP (15 +/- 5 vs 8 +/- 3 mmHg) which were elevated in the nicardipine group (P less than 0.01). Mannitol infusion and deliberate hypotension resulted in nearly identical haemodynamic responses in both groups. Nicardipine-treated patients required more intravenous fluids during the operative procedure (2.4 +/- 0.3 L vs 1.5 +/- 0.4 L, P less than 0.05) and were less likely to require isoflurane supplementation to morphine sulphate/nitrous oxide anaesthesia (P less than 0.01). In summary, our experience with nicardipine HCl revealed no major untoward effects with respect to maintenance of intraoperative haemodynamic stability despite continuous antivasospasm therapy with this vasodilator.\r"

  ".W": "In the Syrian cardiomyopathic hamster heart, abnormal cellular calcium regulation, resulting in cellular calcium overload, is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Alternatively, the primary abnormality may be coronary vasospasm, resulting in reperfusion-induced necrosis. According to the latter hypothesis, only those cells that suffer an ischemic insult would contain elevated calcium levels. To determine whether a generalized elevation in myocytic calcium exists in myopathic hamster hearts, we measured cellular and subcellular calcium concentrations by electron probe microanalysis in cryosections of 50-day and 96-day myopathic and control hearts, rapidly frozen in vivo. Total calcium content of ventricular homogenates from each group was also measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. No significant differences in subcellular calcium were found by electron probe microanalysis among 50-day and 96-day myopathics and their age-matched controls. In 50-day myopathic and control hearts, mitochondrial calcium was 0.7 +/- 0.2 and 0.9 +/- 0.2, respectively, and A-band calcium was 3.0 +/- 0.4 and 2.6 +/- 0.4 mmol calcium/kg dry wt(+/- SEM). Results from 96-day animals were similar. Localized regions of elevated calcium were found only at sites of necrotic foci: in Na+-loaded cells (mitochondria: 4.7 +/- 1.3 (SEM) mmol/kg dry wt), in dying cells (mitochondria: 72 +/- 22 (SEM) mmol/kg dry wt) or as extracellular deposits (7-10 mol/kg dry wt). Total calcium content of hearts from myopathic hamsters, as determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, was also 13 times (50-day) and 50 times (96-day) higher than controls. These results demonstrate that there is a marked heterogeneity in cellular calcium content in myopathic hamster hearts, but the data do not support the hypothesis of a generalized cellular calcium overload.\r"

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether proximal tubules respond to the elevated renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure and whether the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis would alter the effect of elevated renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure on proximal sodium reabsorption. Expansion of renal interstitial volume by injecting 100 microliters of 2.5% albumin solution through a chronically implanted matrix increased renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure similarly in control rats (n = 8) and in indomethacin (n = 8) or meclofenamate-treated (n = 7) rats. In the absence of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, renal interstitial volume expansion significantly increased the fractional delivery of sodium at the superficial late proximal tubules from 56.5 +/- 6.1 to 67.0 +/- 6.5% (p less than 0.01) with an accompanying increase in fractional excretion of sodium from 2.1 +/- 0.5 to 3.0 +/- 0.4% (p less than 0.01). In the presence of indomethacin or meclofenamate, renal interstitial volume expansion failed to augment the fractional delivery of sodium and the fractional excretion of sodium. In summary, these studies demonstrate that the synthesis of prostaglandins plays a role in the regulation of sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubules in response to elevated renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure.\r"

We used the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2 and digital imaging microscopy to study the spatial distribution of intracellular Ca2+ in arterial myocytes and the changes elicited by activation with norepinephrine (NE). Viable arterial myocytes were obtained from bovine tail arteries by enzymatic digestion. In modified Krebs' solution containing 1.8 mM Ca2+, these myocytes were relaxed and spindle-shaped. The cells contracted rapidly when exposed to NE or high-K+ solution ejected from a micropipette; they relaxed slowly when the activator was washed away. NE evoked a rise in Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) in the cells within 100 msec, at a time when the cells had not yet begun to contract. Maximal [Ca2+] levels were attained within 600 msec, at which time the cells were substantially contracted. Digital analysis of images of cellular fura-2 fluorescence revealed that the intracellular [Ca2+] was relatively uniformly distributed prior to activation, with an average resting level of 111 +/- 14 nM (n = 6). During NE-evoked contractions, intracellular [Ca2+] increased, and the distribution of [Ca2+] became much more heterogeneous. On recovery from activation, the cells relaxed, usually attaining less than 90% of their original resting length. In contrast to the relatively uniform Ca2+ distribution observed prior to NE activation, discrete regions of elevated [Ca2+] were observed throughout the recovered cells. The large spatial variation of [Ca2+] after cell activation implies that Ca2+ was sequestered at localized sites in the cell during relaxation.\r"

  ".W": "LY186126 was found to be a potent inhibitor of type IV cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of canine cardiac muscle. This compound, a close structural analogue of indolidan (LY195115), was prepared in high specific activity, tritiated form to study the positive inotropic receptor(s) for cardiotonic phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as indolidan and milrinone. A high-affinity binding site for [3H]LY186126 was observed (Kd = 4 nM) in purified preparations of canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Binding was proportional to vesicle protein, was inactivated by subjecting membranes to proteolysis or boiling, and was dependent on added Mg2+. Scatchard analysis suggested the presence of a single class of binding sites in the membrane preparation. Indolidan, milrinone, and LY186126 (all at 1 microM) produced essentially complete displacement of bound [3H]LY186126, while nifedipine, propranolol, and prazosin had little or no effect at this concentration. This represents the first reported use of a radioactive analogue to label the inotropic receptor for cardiotonic phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The results suggest that [3H]LY186126 is a useful radioligand for examining the subcellular site(s) responsible for positive inotropic effects of these drugs.\r"

  ".U": "89209168\r", 
  ".W": "In patch-clamped membranes from neonatal rat cardiocytes, elementary Na+ currents were recorded at 19 degrees C for study of the inhibitory influence of several antiarrhythmic drugs including lidocaine, diprafenone, propafenone, and prajmalium on DPI-modified cardiac Na+ channels. Diprafenone (20 mumol/l) and lidocaine (300 mumol/l) induced a voltage- and time-dependent block of reconstructed macroscopic sodium current (INa). The drugs depressed the sustained, noninactivating INa component (which reflects the number and open probability of DPI-modified Na+ channels) effectively, in a voltage- and time-dependent fashion. Once opened, DPI-modified Na+ channels are highly drug-sensitive. Antiarrhythmic drugs (propafenone, diprafenone, and, to a lesser extent, lidocaine) provoke a flicker block, that is, the long-lasting openings are chopped into a large number of short and grouped openings. This indicates rapid transitions between a drug-associated, blocked state and a drug-free, conducting state. The latter has a unitary conductance of 12 pS, very similar to the control value in the absence of antiarrhythmic drugs. The decrease in open time of drug-treated DPI-modified Na+ channels is concentration-dependent. Hill coefficients for propafenone of about 1.0 and for prajmalium of about 0.7 were calculated. A blocking rate constant of 6.1 x 10(7) mol-1sec-1 for propafenone, but of 1.5 x 10(7) mol-1sec-1 for prajmalium was obtained at -30 mV. The unblocking rate constant for propafenone was, also at -30 mV, about twice as large as the unblocking rate constant for prajmalium. The open channel block kinetics are essentially voltage-dependent. The affinity of the channel-associated drug receptor increases on membrane depolarization. The blocking rate constant was inversely related to the number of Na+ ions moving through the open channel. It is concluded that the manifestation of this voltage- and Na+-dependent flicker block is intimately related to removal of fast Na+ inactivation.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y is stored in sympathetic nerve terminals throughout the heart and has direct and indirect effects on cardiac function. Although neuropeptide Y has been shown to be released upon intense (16-30 Hz) cardiac sympathetic stimulation, we sought to determine whether effective quantities of neuropeptide Y were released from cardiac sympathetic neurons under more natural conditions. We recorded arterial pressure and cardiac cycle length in 29 anesthetized dogs. We assessed neuropeptide Y release by measuring the attenuation of vagally induced increases in cardiac cycle length (10 seconds every 2 minutes) after trains of sympathetic stimulation. We examined the effect of constant-frequency sympathetic stimulation (frequencies of 2, 5, 10, and 15 Hz, applied for train durations of 1, 3, and 5 minutes) on vagally induced chronotropic responses. We also determined the effect of varying the pattern of sympathetic stimulation. Both the magnitude and duration of the inhibition of the vagal effects on cardiac cycle length were augmented significantly by increases in the frequency or duration of sympathetic stimulation. In contrast, the inhibition of the vagally induced chronotropic responses was not significantly affected by changes in the pattern of sympathetic stimulation. We also characterized the role of adrenergic receptors. Phentolamine significantly increased the sympathetically mediated inhibition of the vagal effects on cardiac cycle length, but propranolol had no effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the action of the calcium antagonist D600 on calcium channel currents recorded in high barium solution from single, enzymatically isolated smooth muscle cells from the rabbit ear artery using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. D600 (1-100 microM) was applied by path perfusion or by a new technique that allowed a concentration jump during the current. Application of D600 at rest (holding potential, -60 mV) did not alter the peak inward current elicited on depolarization, but the activation of the channels led to a marked block and an acceleration of the current decay. The mechanism of block of calcium channels by D600 was studied by using pulse protocols with different pulse length and different interpulse intervals. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that D600 has a low affinity for the calcium channels in the resting state and that they have to pass to the open state before the drug affects the calcium channel current. A fast onset of the calcium channel block by D600 (time constant, 502 msec) could be shown by rapid application of D600 during the sustained current component of the barium inward current. However, experiments did not definitely distinguish whether binding occurred to the open or to the inactivated state (although there was some evidence of a long-lasting binding to an inactivated state).\r"

  ".W": "The development of cardiac hypertrophy secondary to pressure overload is accompanied by isoformic changes of contractile proteins such as myosin and actin. 35S-Labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) probes and in situ hybridization procedures were used for analysis of the regional distribution of newly formed transcripts from alpha-skeletal actin (alpha-sk-actin) and beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) genes during the early stages of pressure overload. The study was performed in 25-day-old rats submitted to a thoracic aortic stenosis and killed after surgery at times ranging from 4 hours to 3 days. Neither alpha-sk-actin nor beta-MHC messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected in the hearts of normal and sham-operated animals. However, alpha-sk-actin mRNA accumulated throughout the entire left ventricle as early as 4 hours after aortic stenosis, and by 12 hours was also detected in the left atrium. In contrast, beta-MHC mRNA was hardly detectable before day 1, and by days 2-3 was mainly restricted to the inner part of the left ventricle and around the coronary arteries. The absence of spatial and temporal coordination in the accumulation of alpha-sk-actin and beta-MHC mRNAs indicates that different signals and/or regulatory mechanisms are implicated in the induction of the two genes in response to hemodynamic overload.\r"

  ".W": "The possible role of plasma low-density protein (LDL) receptors in the uptake and degradation of LDL in the whole arterial wall was investigated by comparison of the in vitro uptake of 125I-native LDL (nLDL) and 131I-methylated LDL (mLDL) by the media of deendothelialized rabbit thoracic aorta excised at in vivo length and pressurized to 70 mm Hg, taking the advantage that mLDL is not recognized by the LDL receptor. The distribution of the relative concentrations of nLDL (Cn) and mLDL (Cm) across the wall was obtained using a serial frozen sectioning technique. The aorta was incubated under three different conditions for varying periods of incubation in order to analyze separately the processes of binding, binding-internalization, and degradation. At 39 degrees C, in which binding-internalization and degradation occurred, Cn was significantly higher than Cm at each position across the media. The mean medial Cn/Cm ratio was 1.36 +/- 0.15 (n = 5) after 1 hour of incubation, and decreased to 1.23 +/- 0.22 (n = 7) after 2 hours of incubation and to 1.13 +/- 0.11 (n = 5) after 4 hours of incubation. At 4 degrees C, in which internalization and degradation were blocked, the Cn/Cm ratio reflected the surface nLDL binding alone; the Cn/Cm ratio was 1.47 +/- 0.20 (n = 5) after 4 hours of incubation, higher than the value obtained at 39 degrees C. To investigate whether degradation of nLDL occurred after receptor binding, the interstitial LDL was washed out by an LDL-free solution after 2-hour incubation at 39 degrees C. After 30 minutes of washout, the Cn/Cm ratio decreased to 1.06 +/- 0.20 (n = 5) in the inner media and was unchanged in the outer media. After 1 hour of washout, the ratio declined to 0.57 +/- 0.18 (n = 7) in the inner part of the media and increased progressively to 1 at the media-adventitia boundary. The Cn/Cm ratio, at 0.67 +/- 0.12 (n = 5), was practically constant throughout the media after 2 hours of washout. The nLDL degradation rate across the media was obtained from the comparison of nLDL and mLDL before and after the washout. A steep decreasing gradient in nLDL degradation rate was observed from the luminal to the external surface. The mean medial nLDL degradation rate value was 9.6 +/- 4.5 microliters/cm3 wet tissue/hr. We concluded that functional LDL receptors participate in the uptake and degradation of LDL in the whole aorta.\r"

To determine the degree of regional blood flow reduction required to induce changes in high energy phosphates and pH, and to correlate these metabolic changes with alterations in blood flow, 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed in an in vivo porcine model of graded coronary stenosis. Simultaneous measurements of regional blood flow and phosphate compounds were made during various steady-state degrees of regional ischemia in which subendocardial blood flow was reduced by as much as 80%. ATP did not fall over the total range of graded ischemia, while phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and pH all changed progressively after blood flow was reduced below 50% of normal. The ratio of PCr/Pi (a measure of the energy reserve of the myocardium) was strongly correlated to subendocardial blood flow (r = 0.94) and declined by 25% when blood flow was reduced by only 21% below normal. These findings indicate that PCr/Pi is a sensitive marker of ischemia and support the hypothesis that the in vivo energy status of the myocardium is closely coupled to myocardial blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are a type of triggered activity found in heart muscle. We used voltage-clamped sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers to examine the mechanism underlying EADs induced near action potential plateau voltages with the Ca2+ current agonist Bay K 8644 and the effect of several interventions known to suppress or enhance these EADs. Bay K 8644 produced an inward shift of the steady-state current-voltage relation near plateau voltages. Tetrodotoxin, lidocaine, verapamil, nitrendipine, and raising [K]o abolish EADs and shift the steady-state current-voltage relations outwardly. Using a two-pulse voltage-clamp protocol, an inward current transient was present at voltages where EADs were induced. The voltage-dependence of availability of the inward current transient and of EAD induction were similar. The time-dependence of recovery from inactivation of the inward current transient and of EAD amplitude were nearly identical. Without recovery of the inward current transient, EADs could not be elicited. The inward current transient was enhanced with Bay K 8644 and blocked by nitrendipine, but was not abolished by tetrodotoxin or replacement of [Na]o with an impermeant cation. These results support a hypothesis that the induction of EADs near action potential plateau voltages requires 1) a conditioning phase controlled by the sum of membrane currents present near the action potential plateau and characterized by lengthening and flattening of the plateau within a voltage range where, 2) recovery from inactivation and reactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels to carry the depolarizing charge can occur. Our results suggest an essential role for the L-type Ca2+ \"window\" current and provide a framework for understanding the role of several membrane currents in the induction and block of EADs.\r"

  ".W": "Fetal head compression during normal labor can increase intracranial pressure (ICP). We studied the cerebral and peripheral blood flow responses to ICP elevation in utero in chronically catheterized fetal sheep using the radiolabeled microsphere technique. ICP was elevated, stepwise, in increments of 6 +/- 1 mm Hg by infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid into a lateral ventricle. When ICP was raised to within 28 mm Hg of baseline mean arterial blood pressure (i.e., ICP above 22 mm Hg), arterial pressure began to increase. Above this ICP level, up to 41 mm Hg, mean cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained by equivalent increases in arterial pressure. Cerebral blood flow and O2 uptake at the highest ICP levels were not different from baseline values. Changes in peripheral organ blood flow were graded according to the level of ICP. At the highest level (ICP = 41 mm Hg), renal, gastrointestinal, and skin blood flow decreased by 68%, 69%, and 65%, respectively. Myocardial and adrenal blood flow doubled, whereas heart rate and cardiac output were unchanged. Placental blood flow increased in proportion to arterial pressure. Arterial plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine and arginine vasopressin increased by nearly two orders of magnitude. Therefore, as ICP approaches baseline mean arterial pressure, fetal lambs are capable of sustaining cerebral perfusion by initiating profound visceral vasoconstriction without curtailing placental blood flow. Since cerebral O2 uptake was maintained, there is no evidence that stimulation of the peripheral response requires pronounced cerebral ischemia. This highly developed Cushing response may be important for ensuring cerebral viability when the fetal head is compressed during parturition.\r"

In order to choose between 2 possible mechanisms explaining this increase (increased intestinal absorption or decreased tissue storage of aluminum), we gave, in the present study, 1 alpha (OH)3 the same dose (6 micrograms per week) for the same period (4 weeks) to 15 stable hemodialyzed patients after their Al(OH)3 had been discontinued for 6 weeks. Under Al(OH)3 treatment they had a mean plasma aluminum (2.33 +/- 2.36 mumol/l) which was not significantly different from that of the patients in our former study (1.23 +/- 0.25 mumol/l). After Al(OH)3 discontinuation, plasma aluminum (measured by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry) decreased significantly as early as the 2nd week of the control period (1.39 mumol/l). The decrease was maintained at a plateau throughout the 5 weeks of the control period (1.38 mumol/l), the 4 weeks of 1 alpha OH vitamin (vit) D3 administration (1.40 mumol/l) and the 8 weeks of the post 1 alpha (OH)3 period (1.22 mumol/l). Plasma calcium and phosphate concentrations increased significantly with 1 alpha (OH)3 and decreased thereafter whereas plasma PTH concentrations decreased during 1 alpha (OH)2 D3 and increased after its discontinuation suggesting biological activity of 1 alpha (OH)3. Since 1 alpha (OH)3 increases plasma aluminum in hemodialyzed patients only when they are simultaneously taking Al(OH)3, it is suggested that this increase is explained by an increase of intestinal absorption of aluminum and not by a tissue redistribution of aluminum.\r"

Energy expenditure (EE) and hypermetabolism (measured EE expressed as percent above predicted basal metabolic rate) were investigated in 22 artificially ventilated patients with MOF during the second to fourth postoperative weeks. Eleven of these patients had severe acute renal failure (ARF) necessitating extracorporeal renal replacement therapy, whereas eleven patients had normal or only moderately impaired renal function (serum creatinine less than 200 mumol/l). The average EE in all patients was 124 +/- 17 (SD) kJ/kg x 24 h and the average hypermetabolism was 35 +/- 12%. Patients with MOF including ARF had significantly (p less than 0.01) lower EE (114 +/- 12 kJ/kg x 24 h) and hypermetabolism (28 +/- 7%) than patients with normal or only moderately impaired renal function (133 +/- 17 kJ/kg x 24 h and 42 +/- 12%, respectively). The results confirm that patients with MOF have only a moderate hypermetabolism and indicate that hypermetabolism is even less pronounced in MOF patients with ARF. The results suggest that the presence of ARF in MOF is associated with a more extensive reduction in aerobic metabolism than may be attributed to the loss of renal function. The marked interindividual variation in EE emphasizes the importance of EE monitoring as a guideline for nutritional support.\r"

Antibodies to different NC1 determinants in serum, PPF and eluate were detected by immunofluorescence of glomerular capillaries of normal kidney. In addition, the antibody in PPF, but not in the eluate, reacted strongly in a plate-binding radioimmunoassay with NC1 domain extracted from normal human GBM, and bound by Western blotting to both dimer (46 kD and 49 kD) and monomer (24 kD, 26 kD and 28 kD) components of the NC1 domain. Analysis of the NC1 domain in the patient's GBM by SDS-PAGE showed a number of abnormalities, including an absence of monomer bands. Moreover, there was diminished reactivity of the patient's NC1 domain by the radioimmunoassay and Western blotting, using his PPF and a rabbit anti-NC1 antiserum. These findings indicated that there were different types of antibodies to NC1 domain in PPF and eluate, associated with an abnormal NC1 domain in GBM. These results have allowed us to speculate on the pathogenesis of anti-GBM nephritis in this patient.\r"

Porous ingrowth designs are one alternative, but bone ingrowth is unpredictable, thigh pain is a frequent clinical finding, stress shielding is often observed, revision is more complicated, and microporous components are mechanically weaker. A new anthropometric femoral component has been designed with a goal of long-term stability through osseointegration. The prosthesis is optimized for canal fill in the distal metaphysis and proximal diaphysis. The components are manufactured in 16 sizes, with cutting broaches precisely machined to the same dimensions to provide an exact fit to the femur. The high-strength TiAl6V4 alloy stem is combined with heads of either CoCr alloy or alumina (Al2O3) for reduced polyethylene wear. The 135 degrees neck-shaft angle and modular design allow for restoration of the abductor lever arm. Because the prosthesis is not porous coated, it is also suitable for use with cement. In cemented application, the prosthesis shape provides an optimal cement mantle. Seventy-one total hip arthroplasties have been performed using the Anthropometric Total Hip (ATH) prosthesis: 31 with exact-fit cementless fixation and 40 with cement. Of those using cementless fixation, 21 have been followed for more than one year (mean, 20 months; range, 12-48 months). The early clinical findings are as good as, or superior to, other cementless designs used at the authors' institution. Stress remodeling of the proximal femur occurs early and stabilizes by one year. The observed changes appear to improve the stability of the prosthesis. Clinical and roentgenographic findings suggest the osseointegration of the ATH femoral component.\r"

In dyschondroplasia (Ollier's disease), the long bones grow in diameter but not in length. In this condition, it was possible (by fasciotomy, osteotomy, and interposition of wedge blocks or hemicylindrical bone implants (stabilized by an intramedullary rod) to lengthen the leg 23.3 cm in ten stages, during the period between five and 14 years of age. With the additional procedure of epiphyseal arrest of the contralateral distal end of the femur at age 11, the eventual correction of discrepancy in leg length was 25.6 cm. Intraoperative and postoperative skin temperature recordings, toe plethysmography, and electromyography show that there were no deleterious changes in the circulatory or neurological functions of the extremity.\r"

Evidence for the presence of fusion has been trabeculation on plain roentgenograms, lack of motion on stress films, and osteosynthesis across the graft-host interface on tomography. However, none of the above is entirely conclusive. Computed tomographic scanning affords a better assessment of the stages of arthrodesis by examination of the remodeling processes. When a graft is totally remodeled and assumes the function of the host bone, the vertebral body in this case, then anatomic fusion or bony arthrodesis has been achieved. In autogeneic graft techniques, this occurs about nine to 12 months after surgery. Initially, there is formation of a peripheral cortical ring phenomenon and then a gradual remodeling of the centrum to cancellous bone and bone marrow.\r"

The resultant average increase in range of motion (ROM) was 60 degrees of active forward elevation and 18 degree of external rotation. Radiolucent lines were present in 17 humeral components; however, none was symptomatic or had progressed in thickness. Five glenoid components demonstrated progression of radiolucency, and two required revision. Both of these were in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Although pain relief was uniformly good among all patient groups, a statistically significant degree of improvement in ROM was found in individuals with osteoarthritis. The etiology of the disease process and the status of the rotator cuff may determine the eventual outcome in individuals treated with total shoulder arthroplasty.\r"

Skeletal muscle injury associated with the trauma of surgery resulted in significant elevations of the absolute value of CK-MB; however, the percentage of CK-MB comprising total CK activity and LD-1:LD-2 did not rise significantly in patients who did not experience postoperative myocardial infarction. It is important to determine both serum CK-MB and LD-1:LD-2 in suspected postoperative myocardial infarction since false positive elevations of CK-MB can occur. Elevations of CK-MB exceeding 50 International Units/liter or 5% of the total CK activity combined with LD-1:LD-2 exceeding 1.0 should not be attributed to skeletal muscle injury alone following total joint arthroplasty of the hip or knee.\r"

None of the stability parameters was significantly different from normal in either configuration of the tibial surface, but the constrained surface did decrease rotational deflection compared to the rotationally unconstrained surfaces. These findings show that rotational constraint in a posterior stabilized TKA is not necessary to achieve rotational stability as long as varus-valgus stability is achieved by appropriately tensioning the collateral ligaments.\r"

  ".W": "Six anatomical specimens were used to evaluate the ligament length pattern and mean maximal ligament length change (MMLLC) of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) using a ligament replacement with a 6-mm diameter. Three femoral and three tibial attachment sites were selected. Nine different combinations were studied in intact knees and also in knees whose posterior capsule and arcuate ligament complex were sequentially divided, whose menisci were resected, and whose capsule and arcuate complex were repaired. The smallest ligament length change (5.6 mm) was obtained in the intact knee with the anatomic femoral and tibial attachments. Moving the femoral origin either anteriorly or to the over-the-top position significantly increased the MMLLC. Moving the tibial insertion posteriorly had a negligible effect, but changing to an anterior attachment site increased (but not significantly) the MMLLC. Even for anatomically positioned ligaments, the instability caused by sectioning the posterior capsule and arcuate ligament complex increased the MMLLC by more than 80%. Resection of both menisci did not result in a further increase in the MMLLC, but repairing the posterior capsule and arcuate complex restored the length changes to those of the intact knee. These data confirm the importance of precise anatomic placement of the femoral and tibial tunnels when performing intraarticular ACL grafts for anterolateral rotatory instability. The adverse effect of certain other associated instabilities on the ligament length change, even with correct tunnel placement, has been demonstrated and may be one explanation for the variability in the clinical results of these procedures.\r"

In seven of these nine patients, a bending stiffness of at least 10 Nm/degree was obtained, suggesting that this stiffness value is a safe and reliable indicator for successful arthrodesis. Arthrodesis compression declined rapidly; daily adjustments were required to maintain a compression of 500 Newtons. A small but significant loss of length was associated with this high value of compression. On reduction of the compression to 200 Newtons, the rate of decrease of compression and the loss of length across the arthrodesis were simultaneously reduced.\r"

One hundred forty-one of these patients had had a cast brace or fracture brace as part of their treatment program, either as the primary fracture treatment or after open reduction or traction. The aims of this study were (1) to determine if cast bracing could maintain alignment, fracture position, and range of motion and (2) to compare its results with those of other major long-term studies of similar fractures. There were 85 lateral, 24 medial, and 32 bicondylar fractures. Cast bracing was used for one to 17 weeks, with a mean of eight weeks. Ninety-nine of the 141 patients were followed for at least one year. Eighty-two of the patients maintained alignment with less than 5 degrees of deformity, and fracture position was maintained in 85% of cases, with only 15% having 4-8 mm of loss of position. Medial plateau and subcondylar fractures had an increased incidence of fracture position loss. Ninety-seven percent of patients had greater than 90 degrees of flexion, and 90% had full extension, i.e., less than 5 degrees of contracture. Pain was minimal or absent after heavy exercise in 90% of patients using cast bracing. Arthritic changes on roentgenographic analysis were absent or mild in 93.5% and moderate or severe in 6.5% of patients. Complications, including phlebitis, pulmonary emboli, wound infection, hardware slippage, and skin slough, occurred in nine patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "At a low total endogenous calcium content, as in the reserve and proliferative zone chondrocyte, cells buffer their ionized calcium pool at a low steady state between 150 and 300 nM. The endoplasmic reticulum appears to be primarily effective in the regulation of the ionized calcium pool under these conditions. With calcium loading of 20 to 30 nmol Ca+2/mg protein, as in the hypertrophic zone chondrocyte, the cells buffer their ionized calcium pool at a higher steady state between 600 and 700 nM. The mitochondria appear to be primarily effective in buffering the cytosolic ionized calcium pool after calcium loading. These data suggest that in the growth plate as the chondrocyte approaches the mineralization front, there is an accumulation of intracellular calcium that results in the saturation of the capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum to buffer the ionized calcium pool at a low steady state. Under these conditions of calcium loading, there is an increase in the intracellular ionized calcium concentration and a shift toward mitochondrial buffering of this calcium pool. This study has clinical relevance because in the cartilaginous tissues of the growth plate and in fracture callus, the matrix mineralizes as a prerequisite step in the formation of bone. Intracellular calcium accumulation and calcium release appear to play a role in matrix mineralization. An understanding of how the chondrocyte regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis in states of calcium accumulation is important in the overall understanding of bone development and fracture healing.\r"

Incorporation rapidly declined after Mankin 11-12. Both matrix synthesis and cell proliferation were strongly reduced in the severe grades of OA. Histologic examination of the newly formed cartilage was only possible if the chondrocytes were derived from less severe grades of OA. Microscopy showed healthy chondrocytes surrounded by newly synthesized matrix, which stained well with specific dyes, indicating the ability of the cells to synthesize normal matrix components. The phenotype of human articular chondrocytes, derived from different grades of OA, was maintained in a high-density culture system. The data suggest dysregulation of the cell metabolism in OA cartilage. The increased cell metabolism was directly related to the histopathologic grade of OA.\r"

One hundred five congenitally dislocated hips in 83 children were followed roentgenographically for an average of eight years after reduction. While the percentage of children requiring later acetabuloplasty increased somewhat with advancing age at the time of reduction, numerous acetabulae in the older groups developed satisfactorily without later surgery. The prereduction acetabular index proved a much more reliable predictor of the need for later acetabuloplasty. Sixty percent of those with an acetabular index greater than 37 degrees required later pelvic surgery, compared with 17% of those with a prereduction index less than 30 degrees. The major acetabular response occurred in the first year after reduction in children whose hips were reduced before the age of three years, whereas the maximal response in children whose hips were reduced after three years of age occurred in the second through fourth years. A further drop can be expected in all reduced hips of children between the ages of eight and 11 years.\r"

  ".W": "A cohort of 200 children, who were followed from birth and periodically evaluated as part of a longitudinal study of child development, was used to determine the ability of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) to predict children who would be considered intellectually gifted at 7.5 years. The cohort was predominantly white (91%), upper middle class (70% in Hollingshead class 1 or 2), and had preschool educational experiences (94%). At outcome, 36 children had WISC-R verbal, performance, or full scale IQs greater than 135 and were called gifted. On average, gifted children walked 0.7 months earlier and spoke two-word sentences 2.2 months earlier than the non-gifted group. As a group, gifted children showed statistically significant, but clinically small, advantages for age of walking, age of speaking two-word sentences, BSID, and Stanford Binet IQ. Of the 36 children who later proved to be gifted, only two had BSID IQs greater than 134. Of the four children who had BSID IQs greater than 134, two maintained their superior function but 2 did not. A discriminant function analysis was used to predict giftedness for individual children based on BSID performance. The resulting classification achieved sensitivity = 0.69 and specificity = 0.39. Although groups of infants who will be gifted have higher BSID scores, the BSID cannot be endorsed as a method of identifying individual infants who will later demonstrate superior cognitive function.\r"

Ultimately, 90 of the 97 pediatricians practicing in the community took part. The following factors are felt to have contributed to the widespread participation of the pediatricians: 1) the subject was interesting and of relevance to clinical practice; 2) the study was designed so as not to interfere with office routine; 3) major demands were not made on the patients; 4) due consideration was given to the value of the physicians' participation; and 5) communication between the investigators and the practitioners was facilitated by a liaison pediatrician.\r"

Major findings were 1) three-fourths of the 176 students on stimulant medication in 1987 had pre-treatment ratings consistent with moderate to severe hyperactivity/inattentiveness; 2) over 90 percent of the students evidenced at least 50 percent improvement initially following stimulant treatment by teacher ratings; 3) 76 percent of the medicated students continued to show this level of improvement at the end of the 1987 school year; 4) medication improvement and compliance declined in middle school; 5) 15 percent of the students on stimulant medication in 1987 were inattentive but not hyperactive on baseline teacher ratings, but their degree of improvement with stimulants was equivalent to that of hyperactives; 6) in the county-run hyperkinetic clinic, the subpopulation of inattentive/non-hyperactive students on stimulants rose from 7 percent to 18 percent of the total between 1976 and 1987.\r"

Developmental and behavioral questionnaires to supplement office evaluation of hyperactivity, neuromaturation, and selected cognitive processes continue to be improved. These measures suffer from different biases, focus on different childhood characteristics and associated problems, and approach childhood interaction with the environment differently. Several are psychometrically more sound, and several provide the physician with developmental and social information that may help improve the habilitative prescription. The general pediatrician can use these questionnaires to complement his or her evaluation and follow-up of children who present with learning and behavioral problems. Prior to choosing an instrument, the clinician should review the advantages of each and choose the one most suited to his or her practice.\r"

Results revealed that the majority of parents held favorable attitudes toward the wearing of gloves and masks during patient care activities. Parents who agreed that gloves and masks should be worn also tended to believe that diseases could be spread through cross-infection, that protective wear would prevent such infection, and that their children generally would benefit from these precautions. Parents of preschool-aged children felt that such procedures might make their children more fearful. These data indicate that many parents are basically supportive of the use of infection control procedures with their children and that such techniques do not appear to be an obstacle to effective relationships between health-care professionals and their patients.\r"

We randomized 39 newborns who needed parenteral medication in the intermediate care nursery to receive a heparin lock catheter (17) or an intravenous line kept patent by continuous low infusion rate (22). There were no differences between study groups with regard to birthweight, gestational age, or distribution of diagnoses. Infants in the heparin lock group were enrolled in the study on average 1 day longer than the continuous intravenous group (p less than 0.05). Subcutaneous infiltration occurred twice as frequently with the continuous intravenous line (p = 0.0015), and the life span was significantly less than heparin lock (1.0 +/- 0.5 days versus 2.1 +/- 1.0 days, p = 0.0003). Infants with continuous intravenous lines received approximately 20 ml/kg/day greater quantity of fluid (p less than 0.0001). There was no difference between groups with regard to mean heparin activity level. None of the infants developed hemorrhagic complications, thrombophlebitis, or documented nosocomial infection. Nurses significantly favored heparin locks over continuous intravenous lines for ease of use. The heparin lock technique is a safe and reasonable alternative to a continuous low infusion intravenous line for administering parenteral medications to intermediate care newborns.\r"

Various weak irritant agents were tested for irritating potency on the skin and the sensitivity of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements in the detection of early skin changes was also studied. 10 widely used surfactants and 1 solubilizer were applied to the skin of the forearms of healthy volunteers in aqueous solutions of 12.5 millimoles/l for 45 min twice daily for 3 weeks. The effect on the skin was evaluated daily by means of TEWL measurements and by a visual scoring system. Each solution caused an increase in TEWL value over time due to the cumulative irritating action on the epidermal barrier. This increase in TEWL was different for the various solutions, resulting in different mean TEWL values on the last day of the experiment. Thus, it was possible to rank the agents according to irritating potency. This ranking order was the same in almost every individual and remained constant during the 3 weeks. In comparison with the visual scoring system, the TEWL measurements were more sensitive in the detection of early changes in the skin.\r"

The effect of the emulsions on the barrier function of the skin was evaluated by means of SVL measurements. The emulsion based on mineral greases significantly reduced SVL values during both weeks, possibly because of an occlusive effect. The emulsion with 15% of linoleic acid significantly reduced SVL values during the 1st week but not during the 2nd week. The emulsion with 38% of linoleic acid did not reduce SVL values at all.\r"

However, measurement of cross-brain oxygen extraction in children is currently not a part of routine clinical care, partly because there have been no published attempts relating the technique of jugular venous bulb (JVB) catheterization and its complication in children. We catheterized the JVB to measure cerebral venous oxygen content and calculate cross-brain oxygen extraction in 26 deeply comatose neonates and children ranging in age from a few hours to 14 yr. Bedside catheterization using the Seldinger technique was successful in 25 children, with standard venous cutdown necessary in the remaining child. All JVB catheterizations were performed with parental consent and during continuous monitoring of the intracranial (ICP) or fontanelle, as well as arterial, pressure. ICP was not significantly altered by the cannulation procedure in any of the children studied, although the cannulation occurred early in the child's course when ICP was well controlled. Inadvertent carotid artery puncture with bleeding controlled by local pressure occurred in four children, and catheter malposition was confirmed on lateral skull xray in two others. Jugular venous bulb catheters remained in place for 2 to 7 days (average 3) and malfunction or obstruction of the catheter did not occur. Organisms were grown from three of 26 catheter tips submitted for culture, with peripheral blood cultures also positive for the same organisms in two of these.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fluid challenge was administered iv as 250 ml of test colloid every 15 min until the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (WP) was greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg or a maximum dose of 2000 ml was infused. Hemodynamic, respiratory, and coagulation profiles were measured before and after fluid infusion. The amount of colloid required to achieve a WP of 15 mm Hg was comparable between groups. Both colloid infusions resulted in similar increases in cardiac output, stroke output, and stroke work. The effect of fluid infusion with pentastarch on coagulation was not significantly different from albumin, although pentastarch was associated with a 45% decrease in factor VIII:c. We conclude that pentastarch is equivalent to albumin for fluid resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis.\r"

We addressed this question by prospectively studying 14 consecutive patients admitted with metabolic acidosis and without hyperkalemia. Arterial blood gas analysis and serum potassium determinations were performed during acidosis and after its correction. ECGs were recorded at the same times. Mean pHa increased from 7.11 +/- 0.05 to 7.40 +/- 0.01 (p less than .001) in response to an increase in total CO2 content from 6.8 +/- 1.4 to 21.2 +/- 0.7 mmol/L (p less than .001). Serum potassium concentration decreased only slightly after correction of the acidosis from 4.2 +/- 0.1 to 3.9 +/- 0.14 mmol/L (p less than .05). T waves were taller during acidosis than after correction (0.68 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.28 +/- 0.04 mV, p less than .001 and 0.64 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.04, p less than .005, in precordial leads V2 and V3, respectively). Moreover, the amplitude of T waves in V2 was correlated positively with the arterial concentration of H+ (r = .786, p less than .001) and negatively with the arterial total CO2 content (r = -.71, p less than .005). In addition to their augmented amplitude, T waves were peaked and symmetrical with a narrow base (\"tent-shaped\"). Thus, metabolic acidosis may be accompanied by an increase in the amplitude of T waves, even in the absence of hyperkalemia.\r"

Sixteen (21%) patients subsequently died in the ICU. The nonsurvivors had significantly higher SAPS, APACHE II, and CPI scores than the survivors. ROC curves drawn for each severity index were in a discriminating position. There were no significant differences either between the areas under the ROC curves drawn for SAPS, APACHE II, and CPI, or between the overall accuracies of these indices. APS provided less homogeneous information. We conclude that SAPS and APACHE II, two severity indices which are easy to use, assess accurately the short-term prognosis, i.e., the ICU outcome, of patients with AMI.\r"

Substantial differences in utilization were found. The patients in Hospital 2 were younger, had better previous health records, and were admitted significantly more often for active treatment as opposed to monitoring than the patients in Hospital 1. Although their measured severity of illness was similar, patients at Hospital 2 received significantly more therapy and their mortality exceeded that of the patients at Hospital 1. The mortality rate of Hospital 2 also exceeded that predicted from a recent survey of U.S. hospitals. We found, however, that 35% of the patients at Hospital 2 had been transferred to the ICU from other ICUs. This created the possibility of an adverse selection and lead-time bias for the patients at Hospital 2. These findings indicate that although national and international comparisons of intensive care are now possible using common classification systems, this progress has created a new need for more precise measurement of potential confounding biases, such as the duration of intensive care services received before formal ICU admission.\r"

All infants were greater than 2 kg birth weight and met criteria based on alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference (P[A-a]O2), barotrauma criteria, or both P(A-a)O2 and barotrauma criteria. All infants had persistent pulmonary hypertension. Two patients also had hyaline membrane disease and one also had asphyxia and meconium aspiration. All patients were treated with conventional therapy and all survived. There were no patients who met criteria for ECMO and died and there were no patients referred for ECMO during this period. Published criteria for ECMO estimate a control group mortality rate of 80% to 94%. Mortality for this series was 0%. (Ninety-five percent confidence interval for mortality in a group of five survivors is 0% to 45%.) Controlled trials of ECMO were not done initially because it was considered unethical. This series shows that historical mortality rates are no longer valid and that controlled trials must be done.\r"

Two sets of renal function tests were made: a) control study before NE therapy after the initial intravascular loading and on dopamine infusion (mean dosage 14 +/- 2 micrograms/kg.min); b) in the last 24 h of NE infusion associated with dopamine (2 to 3 micrograms/kg.min). The following renal function tests were measured: urine flow rate, creatinine, osmolar and free water clearances, and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). Data were collected only in 22 nonanuric patients: urine flow rate, creatinine, and osmolar clearance increased (p less than .001), and free water clearance (p less than .001) and FENa (p less than .02) decreased.

We studied the effects of iv lipid infusions on pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen transport to investigate whether the vasoconstrictor, thromboxane (Tx), mediates resulting changes. Newborn piglets were instrumented to observe cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, blood gases, and oxygen contents. Oxygen delivery (DO2), oxygen consumption, and extraction ratios were calculated. All piglets received continuous 1-g/kg.h iv lipid infusions. After one hour, and as the lipid infusion continued, six piglets were given placebo (PL) and six others were given the Tx antagonist SQ 29548 (SQ). Pulmonary vasoconstriction occurred in both groups after one hour of lipid infusion (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] 28 +/- 6 mm Hg in the PL piglets and to 31 +/- 13 mm Hg in the SQ piglets. After intervention, PAP remained elevated only in the PL group (32 +/- 2 vs. 23 +/- 8 mm Hg) (p less than .02). PaO2 and DO2 fell significantly with iv lipid and improved after intervention in SQ animals only (p less than .02). TxB2 increased in all animals with iv lipid (276 +/- 295 to 1481 +/- 716 in PL; 228 +/- 110 to 1402 +/- 580 in SQ), and fell with intervention in the SQ animals only (2632 +/- 1236 vs. 964 +/- 305, respectively; p less than .02). In conclusion, interference with DO2 associated with pulmonary hypertension and increased TxB2 occurred with iv lipid infusion in piglets. Tx antagonism ameliorated these changes.\r"

As there are no recent reports on the effectiveness of norepinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest, we investigated the effectiveness of epinephrine and norepinephrine after asphyxial or ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest using a porcine model. After 3 min of asphyxial cardiac arrest, seven animals each received either 45 micrograms/kg epinephrine, 45 micrograms/kg norepinephrine, or placebo (controls). All drugs were given blind. All seven animals given epinephrine could be resuscitated after 174 +/- 53 sec, whereas six of seven given norepinephrine could be resuscitated after 473 +/- 116 sec. None of the seven given the placebo could be resuscitated. After 4 min of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, none of the seven animals that received defibrillating countershocks at 4 min without either mechanical measures or drug therapy, and none of the seven that received CPR and countershocks but no drugs, could be resuscitated. In the group that received CPR plus 45 micrograms/kg epinephrine, defibrillation and restoration of spontaneous circulation were achieved in six of seven animals in 667 +/- 216 sec. In the group that received CPR plus 45 micrograms/kg norepinephrine, defibrillation and restoration of spontaneous circulation were achieved in all seven animals in the significantly shorter time of 86 +/- 18 sec. In this porcine model, norepinephrine appeared superior to the same dose of epinephrine in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, with respect to resuscitation time.\r"

Furthermore, the pH was significantly lower and the PCO2 significantly higher at the myocardial venous site compared to the mixed venous site, and marked myocardial lactate production occurred during CPR. Calculated bicarbonate and CO2 content (CCO2) did not increase during CPR from any site compared to control values and actually decreased significantly in arterial and myocardial venous samples. Changes in hydrogen ion concentration in both mixed venous and myocardial venous blood correlated with changes in lactate concentration but not total CCO2. Our results during CPR demonstrate a) a significant discrepancy between arterial and mixed venous blood gases but also a large and significant discrepancy between mixed venous and myocardial venous blood gases, b) significant anaerobic systemic and myocardial metabolism, and c) that mixed venous and myocardial venous acidosis is possibly a result of lactic acidosis.\r"

The Ohmeda unit is easily adaptable to the Penlon ventilator, and may also be used to monitor respiratory function in the spontaneously breathing patient. To our knowledge, this is the only battery-driven monitor on the market that provides rate, volume, apnea, and minute ventilation within the same unit.

Six hundred sixty-three arterial blood gas (ABG) samples were analyzed for pHa, PaCO2, and PaO2 in the dog studies. The intra-arterial blood gas system (IBGS) indicated a steady state in 420 instances for pH, 359 instances for PaCO2, and 256 instances for PaO2. Comparison of these ABG and IBGS values by linear regression analysis revealed r = .97 for pHa, .95 for PaCO2, and .96 for PaO2. The mean +/- SD of the difference between ABG and IBGS was -0.02 +/- 0.03 for pHa, 1.05 +/- 3.8 for PaCO2, and -17 +/- 13 for PaO2. Nonsteady states were correctly identified by the IBGS in every instance. Comparisons between 79 temporally matched ABG and IBGS values, exclusive of in vivo calibration samples, in 12 critically ill patients revealed r = .97 for pHa, .96 for PaCO2, and .99 for PaO2. The difference was 0.002 +/- 0.02 for pHa, 0.44 +/- 2.97 for PaCO2, and -1.22 +/- 9.34 for PaO2. We conclude that it is possible to measure continuously pHa, PaCO2, and PaO2 with the IBGS in critically ill patients for periods from 3 to 25.5 h while maintaining the ability to monitor BP and withdraw blood samples from the arterial cannula. Agreement between the two techniques is within clinically acceptable ranges for pHa and PaCO2, whereas PaO2 measurement by the IBGS requires further refinement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-three mechanically ventilated patients with acute bronchopneumonia were studied. Paired samples were collected by both techniques 47 times. Identical results were obtained in 93% of the cases. In 28 pairs, one or several identical organisms were cultured. In 16 pairs, no bacteria were isolated; in the three remaining pairs, results were contradictory. In five patients with concomitant positive blood cultures, the same organisms were cultured from fiberoptic protected brush biopsy, blind bronchial sampling, and blood cultures. These findings support the fact that blind bronchial sampling can be recommended for bacteriologic assessment of the lower respiratory tract in mechanically ventilated patients with diffuse nosocomial bronchopneumonia.\r"

Twelve male patients with stable COPD completed a double blind, randomized trial. On each of three consecutive days, following baseline spirometry, all patients inhaled two puffs of IPR. This was followed by either two additional puffs of IPR, two puffs of metaproterenol (META), or two puffs of placebo. All inhalants were delivered by an InspirEase spacer. Spirometry was repeated at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes. The group mean percentage increases in the FEV1 and FVC from baseline were similar at all times tested for the three protocols. In conclusion, for the group, there was no objective benefit to doubling the standard dose of IPR or combining IPR with META. Two of 12 patients benefited from combining the two bronchodilators. A potential sequence for bronchodilator testing is suggested.\r"

The delivery method was randomized, double-blinded and placebo controlled. The A group received one puff of metaproterenol every five minutes for a total of three puffs (1.95 mg). The jet nebulizer group received 15 mg of metaproterenol by continuous nebulization over ten minutes. Only about 2.75 mg of the original 15 mg delivered by jet nebulizer was calculated to be available for inhalation due to the inefficiencies of the delivery system. The mean percentage of improvement in FVC and FEV1 in the A group was 33.5 and 49.0 percent, respectively. The mean percentage of improvement in FVC and FEV1 in the jet nebulizer group was 22.8 and 33.0 percent, respectively.

Since neutrophils migrate in response to chemotactic factors, chemotactic activity was evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from 12 patients with bacterial pneumonia and ten normal control subjects. Chemotactic activity was greatly elevated in the BAL fluid of the pneumonia patients compared with control subjects (p less than 0.01). To partially characterize the chemotactic factors present in the lavage fluid of the patient group, molecular sieve chromatography was performed on the lavage fluid, and at least three peaks of chemotactic activity were identified. Since the molecular weight of the smaller peaks approximated the molecular weight of two known chemotactic factors, C5a and leukotriene B4, these factors were measured in lavage fluid by radioimmunoassay. C5a was detectable in none of the normal subjects but was detectable in four of 14 BAL samples obtained from the patients. Leukotriene B4 was detectable in all subjects and was significantly elevated in the pneumonia patients (552 +/- 95 vs 81 +/- 16 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). These findings demonstrate that elevated neutrophil chemotactic activity is present in the lungs of patients with bacterial pneumonia and suggest that C5a and leukotriene B4 may account, at least in part, for this increase.\r"

We reviewed all cases of histoplasmosis diagnosed at our institution from 1972 to 1987. Of 469 patients, 71 underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy and had culture/histologic proof of histoplasmosis established by fiberoptic bronchoscopy or other means. A diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis could be made without thoracotomy in only 27. Among those not requiring thoracotomy, diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy and cultures of sputum, gastric washings, blood, bone marrow, and urine. In this subgroup, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was the only positive diagnostic method in eight of 27 patients. We conclude that fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a useful adjunct to other noninvasive measures yielding diagnostic material in most cases, except for solitary pulmonary nodule where it is rarely helpful.\r"

To investigate the relationship of Doppler echocardiography and regional myocardial systolic function during dipyridamole infusion, we evaluated transmitral flow changes detected by pulsed Doppler technique during a high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography test (DET, two-dimensional echo monitoring with dipyridamole infusion, up to 0.84 mg/kg over 10 min). The DET response produced two groups: group 1 (34 patients) with negative DET, and group 2 (35 patients) with positive DET, defined as the development of a newly onset LV regional asynergy. The E/A values overlapped at baseline (1.07 +/- .32 vs .92 +/- .22; p = NS) but differed at peak changes (.92 +/- .26 vs. 75 +/- .25; p less than .01). Heart rate changes could not account for the observed Doppler changes, since the values of R-R interval were similar in the groups, both basally (.927 +/- .226 vs .867 +/- .143 s; p = NS) and at peak dipyridamole (.754 +/- .100 vs. 681 +/- .112; p = NS). Transient myocardial ischemia induced by dipyridamole administration is accompanied by changes in transmitral flow, which consist of an increase in the relative atrial contribution to LV filling, possibly owing to an acute impairment in LV relaxation.\r"

Cancer patients were significantly older, had smoked within the last five years, and had a significantly higher frequency of central abnormalities on chest roentgenogram. Six additional bronchogenic carcinomas were diagnosed at follow-up. Two of these were probably present but not detected at the time of bronchoscopy. We conclude that (1) hemoptysis with a nonsuspicious chest roentgenogram carries an appreciable risk of cancer in older men with substantial smoking histories, (2) these cancers are often resectable, (3) a chest roentgenogram in which the central lung fields are obscured in any way should not be considered negative in patients with hemoptysis, and (4) a negative bronchoscopic examination does not exclude the possibility of cancer in these patients.\r"

In 1987, ten patients in our hospital with various cardiac diagnoses requiring open-heart surgery developed M fortuitum infection at the sternotomy site. As successful chemotherapy, in addition to surgical debridement, relies on in vitro susceptibility testing, ofloxacin and amikacin were thus assessed and found to have very satisfactory MIC. For the former: 1.25 mg/L for eight isolates, 2.5 mg/L for one isolate, and greater than 20 mg/L for one isolate were found. For the latter: 1 mg/L for six isolates, 2 mg/L for two isolates, and 4 mg/L and 8 mg/L for the remaining two isolates were found, respectively. These patients were given ofloxacin (300 mg once daily to 1,200 mg daily in divided doses) for three to six months and 500 mg amikacin daily (in two divided doses intravenously or intramuscularly) for three to eight weeks. The clinical outcome was favorable except for one patient who died of bacteremia due to M fortuitum coupled with many medical complications. Encouraged by these preliminary results, a future prospective study with ofloxacin as single agent for soft tissue, particularly postoperative sepsis due to M fortuitum, will be planned.\r"

Only one report from Japan has previously described three patients with elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressures during obstructive sleep apnea.

  ".W": "Of the various agents which have been employed for sedation in patients undergoing electrocardioversion, diazepam has had the most extensive use. However, this agent possesses several disadvantages including pain and venous complications at the site of injection and a lower incidence of amnesia. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine derivative, is being increasingly used in general and local anesthesia as well as for procedures requiring conscious sedation, eg, endoscopy. We used intravenous midazolam for conscious sedation in 12 patients undergoing a total of 17 cardioversions. All of the patients experienced amnesia for the procedure and manifested no significant adverse effects. However, serious respiratory failure may occur when intravenous midazolam is used in patients with COPD, debilitated patients, or when the drug is injected rapidly. The use of midazolam should therefore be confined to areas that are able to deal with cardiorespiratory complications. Using guidelines and precautions described here, we encountered no major complications. We conclude that midazolam offers a safe and effective alternative to other agents for conscious sedation in patients undergoing electrocardioversion.\r"

  ".U": "89210054\r", 
  ".W": "Using spontaneously beating rat myocardial cells as an in vitro model of myocardial depression, recent studies demonstrated that septic shock patients' sera frequently contain a myocardial depressant substance (MDS) that is associated with a reversible decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). To further characterize MDS, 50 consecutive patients with possible septic shock were studied serially from shock onset until recovery or death. Thirty-four patients had criteria diagnostic of septic shock, and 16 had a nonseptic critical illness. Of the 34, 14 met strict criteria for circulating MDS, with a mean inhibition of 35 percent (range 20 percent to 62 percent). Compared with those patients not exhibiting significant MDS activity, the 14 MDS-positive patients had a lower mean minimal EF (28 percent vs 39 percent, p less than 0.01), a greater mean decrease in EF (22.1 percent vs 8.8 percent, p = 0.002), a higher pulmonary artery wedge pressure (16.8 vs 11.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), greater LV dilatation (162 vs 118 ml/m2, p = 0.02), and a higher circulating mean peak lactic acid (6.9 vs 2.7 mmol/L, p less than 0.01). In the 14 MDS-positive patients, the in vitro myocardial cell depression had a negative correlation with the in vivo EF (r = -060, p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that a circulating MDS is a cause of the myocardial depression frequently accompanying human septic shock.\r"

  ".W": "Heat stroke is a life-threatening syndrome of multi-organ dysfunction caused by elevated body temperature. It may result from failure of the thermoregulatory mechanisms or from inadequate heat dissipation and affects members of several risk groups. A number of authors reported cardiac involvement in heat stroke, but heart failure rarely has been documented. We report the cases of two heat stroke victims, one of whom developed pulmonary edema and the other, peripheral edema. In both, RVG demonstrated dilatation and diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle, which persisted for several weeks. We conclude that the heart may be involved in heat stroke and that heart failure is a potential complication of the syndrome that can have a prolonged subclinical course. Fluid replacement in heat stroke should be done under careful observation, which may be facilitated by noninvasive assessment of cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of forward flow produced by precordial compression during CPR was investigated with the aid of echocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated domestic pigs. Both mitral and tricuspid valves opened during compression diastole and closed during compression systole. Valve motion persisted throughout resuscitation in 17 of 22 animals which were hemodynamically resuscitated. There was a 25 percent reduction in left ventricular area during compression systole. Maximum pressure generated during compression systole in the aorta exceeded that of the right atrium throughout the 12-min interval of precordial compression in successfully resuscitated animals. These observations provide evidence of direct cardiac compression as the mechanism accounting for effective forward blood flow during CPR. The persistence of valve function, chamber compression, and pressure gradients during precordial compression was predictive of successful resuscitation. The absence of these factors prognosticates failure of resuscitation and explains, in part, the inconsistency of prior reports.\r"

The collagen content of diseased lungs was significantly increased when compared to control lungs, but no difference was observed among the pathologic groups. The analysis of collagen aggregational state showed maximal aggregation in IPF/CTD, followed by sarcoidosis, ARDS, and control lungs, in decreasing order.

The magnitude of SaO2 depression from awake to REM sleep was inversely correlated with the level of baseline SaO2. Hypercapnic ventilatory response was inversely related to the amount of maximal desaturation in both REM and NREM sleep.

Overall survival from the time of initial diagnosis ranged from 13 to 63 months. Survival following initial craniotomy ranged from 12 to 56 months.

A baseline ventilation-perfusion lung scan was obtained initially in every patient, whether the original diagnosis was pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis. Repeat chest roentgenograms and lung scans were obtained routinely at eight days of heparin treatment. The primary trial endpoints were a finding of a clinically apparent recurrent pulmonary embolism, or laboratory evidence of subclinical pulmonary embolism. Eight items of clinical and laboratory information were recorded at admission and then correlated with the lung scan results. Recurrences were seen in seven of 38 patients with an original diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and in five of 83 patients admitted because of venous thrombosis (p = 0.034). Recurrences were also more frequent in patients with a free-floating thrombus on venography (p = 0.014). The risk of new defects in patients with venous thrombosis and without free-floating thrombus was 3.05 percent, venous thrombosis with free-floating thrombus, 13.33 percent; patients with pulmonary embolism without free-floating thrombus, 11.42 percent; and with free-floating thrombus, 38.67 percent. Venography seems thus mandatory in patients with pulmonary embolism, as it recognizes a subgroup of patients at a high risk of recurrences.\r"

The aortic pulse pressure response during strain correlated with resting left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure but not with resting cardiac output, cardiac index and ejection fraction. Similar results were obtained when several indices characterizing the aortic pulse pressure decay during Valsalva were used together to predict resting hemodynamic data by multiple regression analysis. In conclusion, quantitative aortic pulse pressure decay during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver correlated only moderately with hemodynamic indices used to identify myocardial dysfunction. These results raise doubts about the use of the Valsalva maneuver for the evaluation of myocardial dysfunction.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the prevalence of airflow obstruction (100 x FEV1:FVC less than 68% and FEV1 less than 84 percent predicted) in Saskatchewan grain workers of British, German, and Eastern European ancestry using the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OMH) and stepwise logistic regression. We found that the British grain workers had a significantly greater prevalence of airflow obstruction (OMH = 3.2; p less than 0.01) than the Eastern Europeans. We also found that ethnic origin made a significant contribution to the estimation of risk of airflow obstruction among grain workers independent of the effects of age and smoking.\r"

  ".W": "Cotton textile workers have an increased prevalence of both obstructive and restrictive lung function patterns compared with control subjects. Similar abnormal patterns may occur with respiratory diseases of other etiologies, notably those associated with cigarette smoking. The shape of the maximum expiratory flow volume (MEFV) curve has been used to characterize patterns of lung function abnormality. To better evaluate the respiratory effects of cotton dust exposure and to contrast them with those of cigarette smoking, we defined a new functional parameter (angle beta) related to the shape of the MEFV curve. We compared 477 cotton textile workers, both current smokers and never smokers, 45 years and older, with 932 similarly aged control subjects from three communities. Smokers, regardless of their occupational exposure or sex, have smaller beta values than nonsmokers. Cotton textile workers, despite a greater prevalence of abnormal lung function, have beta values that do not differ from those of persons without occupational exposure to cotton dust. We suggest that morphologic patterns of flow volume curves reflect separate effects of cotton dust exposure and smoking and may be related to different sites of airway injury.\r"

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of CAD in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) at different stages of DNP. We studied patients with incipient DNP (group 1, n = 10), overt DNP (group 2, n = 20), renal insufficiency (group 3, n = 27), and end-stage renal failure (group 4, n = 12) and compared them with 30 IDDM patients without clinical signs of DNP (group 5) and with 17 nondiabetic controls (group 6). All groups were matched for age and diabetic groups were matched for duration of diabetes. Assessments of CAD included beat-to-beat variation during forced respiration, heart-rate response to standing, heart-rate response to Valsalva maneuver, basal heart rate, and blood pressure response to standing. Clinical evaluation included assessment of the history and an examination for peripheral polyneuropathy. We found mean impairment of heart-rate variation during respiration, in response to Valsalva maneuver, and in heart-rate response to standing in all diabetic groups compared with nondiabetic controls (P less than .01). Heart-rate responses differed significantly between patients with renal insufficiency (groups 3 and 4) and with other patient groups (group 5; P less than .01). CAD was shown to be more prevalent in patients with DNP, more so as DNP progresses. To some extent, it is already present in the early stages of DNP. CAD may be a contributory factor for increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with DNP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To identify potential components of such an assessment, interobserver variation (neurologist and internist) of a standard neurologic examination and the comparability of this examination with vibratory and thermal sensitivity testing was studied. The study population comprised the first 100 participants in a neuropathy substudy of 25- to 34-yr-old subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus taking part in a cohort follow-up study. Symptoms of dysesthesias, paresthesias, and burning, aching, or stabbing pain revealed good interobserver agreement. Signs of neuropathy, more prevalent in the great toe than index finger, showed poor interobserver agreement for vibration, but fair interobserver agreement for touch and pinprick. Mean quantitative sensory thresholds differed significantly by clinical category of abnormal vibratory and pinprick sensations. Threshold testing showed twice the prevalence of abnormality compared with clinical examination. It is concluded that components of the clinical examination can be identified that, along with quantitative sensory-threshold testing, may provide a satisfactory core assessment for use both in epidemiologic studies and incorporation into more in-depth protocols required for clinical research and practice. The clinical relevance of the greater prevalence of abnormalities on threshold testing will be established by long-term follow-up.\r"

After omega 3FA supplementation, fasting plasma glucose levels increased 22% (P = .005) and meal-stimulated glucose increased 35% (P = .036). The percentage of glucose elevation correlated with percentage ideal body weight (r = .73, P = .04). No significant changes were seen in fasting or meal-stimulated plasma insulin, glucose disposal, or insulin-to-glucagon ratios. Very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels showed consistent reductions of 56% (P less than .001) and 42% (P less than .001), respectively, after omega 3FA supplementation. Total cholesterol levels decreased 7% (P less than .05) without alteration in low- or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Thus, omega 3FA supplementation at a dose of 8 g/day significantly improves plasma TG levels but increases fasting and meal-stimulated glucose concentrations in the type II diabetic patient not treated with insulin or sulfonylurea agents. Marine-lipid concentrate capsules supplying large amounts of omega 3FAs should be used cautiously in the type II diabetic patient.\r"

The two meals were isocaloric and contained equal amounts of carbohydrates. The feedback control on blood glucose continued for 180 min after the meals. Plasma glucose levels and insulin infusion rates delivered by the artificial pancreas after the two test meals did not show any significant differences regarding basal and peak values, peak times, and areas under the curves. A modest amount of sucrose, taken during a mixed meal, does not produce a hyperglycemic effect higher than an equal amount of complex carbohydrates in IDDM patients controlled by artificial pancreas. The same may be expected in well-controlled IDDM patients in conventional therapy because a correlation exists between insulin requirement for conventional therapy and insulin delivered during glucose-controlled insulin infusion.\r"

There was no statistically significant difference between the total variation attributed within and between nurses, possibly indicating that all nurses should be given the same intensity of follow-up training rather than targeting those who perform incorrectly on sample tests. Nurses in the one hospital that required certification before CBG monitoring had significantly less deviation from the laboratory standard than the other three hospitals. Although these data do not provide direct evidence that the certification program increased accuracy, this seems a logical conclusion. More study is needed to determine the most cost-effective type of training and follow-up.\r"

MMI (10(-3) M), which does not damage cell viability, significantly enhanced the increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by TSH and (Bu)2cAMP. In contrast, MMI suppressed the increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by calf serum, insulin-like growth factor I, and Graves' IgG. MMI had no effect on the production of cAMP by TSH. Accordingly, we concluded that MMI has opposite effects on cAMP- and non-cAMP-dependent cell growth pathways. Moreover, Graves' IgG, which has a modest effect on cAMP production, is believed to induce cell growth via the non-cAMP dependent cell growth pathway.\r"

As the retinoic acid receptor cDNA bears a 15% homology to the hydrocortisone receptor cDNA, the effects of retinoic acid were tested in GH3 rat pituitary cells. Retinoic acid selectively stimulated GH secretion after 24 h. Maximal induction of basal GH secretion (220% of controls) was achieved with 1 microM retinoic acid after 72 h. HCT (50 nM) alone stimulated GH secretion 3.5-fold during 72-h incubation, and retinoic acid (1 microM) with HCT caused a further 7-fold increase in GH secretion. The stimulating effects of retinoic acid on GH were observed when cells were incubated in defined serum-free medium, 4% fetal calf serum, or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing HCT. Northern gel hybridization showed that steady state levels of GH mRNA transcripts in these cells were also selectively induced by retinoic acid. PRL secretion and mRNA levels, however, were not appreciably altered by retinoic acid. The results show that retinoic acid selectively stimulates basal and HCT-induced GH secretion and mRNA levels in these cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This selective action of retinoic acid appears to occur independently of the presence of serum in the culture medium.\r"

  ".U": "89210474\r", 
  ".W": "Although many patients with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy exhibit reduced serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] levels, N-terminal fragments of recently identified PTH-related protein as well as PTH itself elevate serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations. In the present study, the effect of tumor extracts from human tumor-implanted hypercalcemic nude rat models with high and low serum 1,25-(OH)2D on renal 1,25-(OH)2D3 production was examined using rat kidney cells in culture. Whereas tumors from rats with high serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels (OCC rats) contained only a single peak of cAMP production-stimulating activity (CPSA) in osteogenic sarcoma cells on reverse phase HPLC, tumor extracts from rats with low serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels (UCC rats) contained at least two peaks of CPSA. The main peak (peak A) was estimated to be approximately 17K by gel permeation chromatography, which was the same as the molecular size of the hitherto identified PTH-related protein, and a minor peak of CPSA (peak B) was estimated to be about 25K. When peak A or crude extracts of OCC tumors as well as human PTH-(1-34) were added to primary cultures of rat kidney cells, the production of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was significantly stimulated. In contrast, although peak B or crude UCC tumor extracts had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3 production in themselves, when they were added together with peak A or human PTH-(1-34) the stimulation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 production was almost completely inhibited. Both peak A and peak B enhanced cAMP production in cultured kidney cells, and the cAMP production by peak A was not affected by peak B. These results are consistent with the possibility that elaboration of an additional factor from tumor cells may be the mechanism by which serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels are suppressed in patients with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The nature as well as the mechanism of action of this factor remain to be elucidated.\r"

We recently demonstrated that P450scc is constitutively synthesized in Leydig cells and that the rate of P450scc synthesis is increased by chronic treatment of the cultures with 8-bromo-cAMP. We now report that glucocorticoids, specifically, decrease the constitutive and cAMP-induced synthesis of P450scc protein as well as the accumulation of P450scc mRNA. The treatment of cultures with as little as 10 nM dexamethasone resulted in a 50-60% decrease in the rate of synthesis of P450scc protein and mRNA content. The glucocorticoid-mediated decrease in P450scc synthesis was prevented when cultures were treated with the antiglucocorticoid RU-486. RU-486 alone had no effect on the rate of protein synthesis. The effect was specific for glucocorticoids; corticosterone (100 nM) or cortisol (100 nM) brought about a similar decrease as dexamethasone. Treatment of cultures with the progesterone agonist R5020 (100 nM), testosterone (2 microM), or estradiol (50 nM) had no effect on the rate of specific protein synthesis. The synthesis of iron sulfur protein reductase (ISP-reductase) and F1-ATPase were not affected by dexamethasone, indicating that the effect was specific for P450scc. The amount of P450scc mRNA was decreased 61% by dexamethasone and increased 144% by treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP. These data together with our previous finding on the negative regulation of P450(17 alpha) protein synthesis by testosterone suggest that the steroidogenic P450 enzymes in Leydig cells are negatively regulated by steroid hormones acting via their cognate receptors.\r"

Young female Sprague-Dawley rats received TBOH injections daily for 2 weeks; growth, body composition, and the composition of selected muscles were assessed. Treated rats grew more rapidly and deposited less body lipid and more protein. The semimembranosus muscle from treated rats was larger and had approximately 60% more DNA per muscle than muscles from control rats. The addition of trenbolone directly to the medium of cultured satellite cells did not stimulate cell proliferation, nor did it augment the stimulatory response of these cells to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). In contrast, satellite cells cultured from TBOH-treated rats exhibited greater proliferative responses to FGF and IGF-I than satellite cells from control rats. In addition, serum from TBOH-treated rats stimulated greater cell proliferation in satellite cell cultures than serum from control rats. These experiments suggest that one possible mechanism responsible for the ability of TBOH to stimulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy may be through enhanced proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells as a result of the increased sensitivity of these cells to IGF-I and FGF.\r"

  ".W": "Although renal hypertrophy occurs rapidly after uninephrectomy, restoring the majority of renal excretory function, it remains unknown whether similar compensatory mechanisms maintain 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production (and calcium homeostasis). To address this issue we compared plasma calcitriol levels and renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)-1-alpha-hydroxylase activity (in remnant kidneys) of mice at various times after uninephrectomy to similar observations obtained in sham-operated age- and sex-matched controls. At all times postoperatively, the uninephrectomized mice sustained plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels no different from those of shams. Maintenance of calcitriol production occurred secondary to a significant increment of renal 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase activity (per mg DNA) 1-3 days after surgery when renal mass/function remained markedly depressed. In contrast, 10 and 21 days postoperatively, when hypertrophy was complete, enhanced enzyme function was no longer apparent. Throughout this period a significant inverse linear correlation existed between renal 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase and the renal mass as well as glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. The variance in enzyme activity resulted in maintenance of a stable renal 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase (per animal or total kidney mass) at all times investigated postuninephrectomy. Such compensatory regulation of vitamin D metabolism after unilateral kidney extirpation may be an important factor contributing to the low morbidity/mortality in the renal donor.\r"

In contrast, in ovariectomized lactating rats, the increase in pituitary LH function is observed by 24 h after pup removal. To determine if progesterone secretion from the ovary participates in the delayed recovery of LH secretion, we treated lactating rats with the progesterone antagonist RU 486 and determined the effects on the time course of recovery of pulsatile LH secretion and LH subunit mRNA after pup removal and on pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. In ovarian-intact lactating rats treated with RU 486, pulsatile LH secretion was observed in about 40% of the rats within 24 h after pup removal (LH interpulse interval, 43.7 +/- 8.3 min) and in about 90% of the rats within 48 h after pup removal (LH interpulse interval, 46.1 +/- 3.6 min). The mean plasma LH level in the RU 486-treated rats was 10.1 +/- 2.2 ng/ml 24 h after removal of pups (control, less than 5 ng/ml) and had increased to 35.1 +/- 6.4 ng/ml 48 h after pup removal (control, 9.1 +/- 2.5 ng/ml). However, RU 486 treatment had no significant effect on LH mRNA subunit levels. To determine whether progesterone acts at the pituitary to block GnRH stimulation of LH secretion, we tested the effects of RU 486 on LH secretion in response to 2- and 5-ng pulses of GnRH. Pituitary responsiveness was tested 24 h after pup removal. We found that both doses of GnRH were effective in stimulating pulsatile LH secretion, and treatment with RU 486 had no significant effect on this response. We conclude from these studies that progesterone secretion from the ovary contributes to the inhibition of LH secretion that occurs after pup removal, since antagonizing progesterone's action resulted in an earlier restoration of pulsatile LH secretion. The increase in LH secretion occurred in the absence of any significant changes in responsiveness of the pituitary to GnRH stimulation or in LH subunit mRNA levels. Therefore, the primary site of action of progesterone would appear to be at the hypothalamus to suppress pulsatile GnRH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "In the female lamb, early postnatal photoperiod treatments do not alter the timing of puberty as do treatments at later ages. In the male lamb, early photoperiod treatments also fail to influence reproductive development. This prompted the hypothesis that the very young lamb may be unable to transduce changes in daylength into appropriate endocrine cues for puberty. The hypothesis was evaluated by determining the ontogeny of pineal melatonin secretory patterns in both female (n = 4-6) and male (n = 4) lambs under natural photoperiods. Serum melatonin concentrations were determined by a modified RIA in samples collected hourly for 24 or 48 h. Clustering analysis was used to define elevated and nonelevated periods of melatonin secretion. Elevated secretion was evident at night in six of eight lambs by 1 week of age and in all lambs by 3 weeks of age. In nearly all cases, the elevated nighttime levels accurately and consistently reflected the duration of the dark period. The mean amplitude of the elevated nighttime melatonin secretion was low in very young lambs and increased with age. No difference between females and males was observed in either the amplitude or duration of the nocturnal melatonin rise. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the failure of early photoperiod treatments to influence reproductive development is due to an inability of the young lamb to transduce photoperiod patterns into an endocrine signal. Rather, they suggest that some other aspect of reproductive neuroendocrine function is restrictive at these ages.\r"

  ".W": "After removal of corticosteroid feedback by surgical or pharmacological adrenalectomy, plasma ACTH increases more rapidly than can be explained by changes in receptor-mediated gene expression. In aminoglutethimide-treated rats, plasma ACTH increased only at doses much higher than those inhibiting plasma corticosterone, suggesting that adrenal enzyme blockers may themselves be stressful. To determine the adrenocortical system response to stressless corticosterone removal, adrenalectomized rats maintained for 5 days on corticosterone in the drinking water were switched to steroid-free fluid (-B) or again given steroid (+B); additional rats were adrenalectomized (ADX). Plasma ACTH did not differ between -B and +B rats until 18-24 h after steroid removal, regardless of whether steroid was withdrawn at the circadian maximum or minimum. Plasma ACTH was similar between -B and ADX rats 0.5-14 days after corticosterone removal, although morning plasma ACTH was more stable in -B rats at 4-7 days. Evening plasma ACTH increased significantly after day 3 in ADX and -B rats. Unlike ADX rats, -B rats did not exhibit pituitary ACTH depletion at 12 and 24 h, but both -B and ADX groups had significantly elevated pituitary ACTH by 6.5 days. We conclude that 1) rapid increases in ACTH secretion after surgical or pharmacological adrenalectomy result from interaction between stress and loss of corticosteroid feedback; 2) no immediate interaction occurs between loss of feedback and circadian stimuli; and 3) the effects of steroid withdrawal may require at least 3 days to be stably expressed.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the effects that pertussis toxin had on bone resorption mediated by cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent stimuli in 19-day-old fetal rat long bones. Agents that stimulate cAMP were PTH, prostaglandin E2, and calcitonin. Agents that act independent of cAMP were: phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate (PMA), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, murine interleukin-1 alpha, osteoclast-activating factor, and human tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Pertussis (1-10 ng/ml) produced a dose-related inhibition of resorption in unstimulated control cultures. The inhibitory effect was not associated with changes in either [3H]thymidine or [3H]proline incorporation into bones. beta-Glucuronidase activity in the medium was decreased. PMA was the only agonist whose resorptive effect was completely blocked by pertussis. The resorptive response to other stimulators was reduced, but treated/control ratios usually remained the same or increased because of the greater effect of pertussis on control resorption. There was a partial inhibition of the resorptive effect of low doses of prostaglandin E2 (10 nM), but increasing the concentration of agonist overcame the inhibition. Pertussis did not enhance the sensitivity of bones to calcitonin. Pertussis enhanced the cAMP response to PTH, but had no effect on basal cAMP production. Since PMA was inhibited by pertussis while agents that may act through cAMP-mediated or phosphatidylinositol pathways were not affected, we hypothesize that a protein kinase-C dependent pathway can modulate bone resorption.\r"

  ".U": "89210488\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that T3 increases adenylate cyclase activity in preparations of plasma membranes from rat thymocytes. On the basis of this and other evidence, we have postulated that the increased cAMP concentration and consequent increase in 2-deoxyglucose (dGlc) uptake that T3 induces in the intact thymocyte is the consequence of a similar stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. To obtain further evidence to this point, we have now conducted experiments with MDL 12330A [N-(cis-2-phenyl-cyclopentyl) azacyclotridecan-2-imine-hydrochloride], a compound that inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in several other tissues. In thymocyte plasma membrane preparations, MDL 12330A induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of both basal enzyme activity (activity in the absence of hormone) and the increase in activity induced by T3 and epinephrine. In the intact thymocyte, MDL 12330A greatly limited the marked increase in cellular cAMP concentration induced by maximally effective concentrations of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3'-isobutyl-1'-methylxanthine. This indicates that MDL 12330A inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in the intact thymocyte as it does in thymocyte plasma membrane preparations. Further, in intact thymocytes incubated with MDL 12330A, there occurred small but significant decreases in basal cAMP concentration and dGlc uptake, and the T3-induced enhancement of these functions was reduced or abolished. These data provide additional evidence that the increase in dGlc uptake in rat thymocytes that T3 induces is linked to an antecedent increase in cellular cAMP concentration, and that the latter results from a T3-induced enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

Saturation analysis revealed a Kd of about 15 nM and a binding capacity of about 33 pmol/mg DNA. The activity of the nuclear binding protein was specific essentially for progestational steroids; the two most potent progesterone competitors were 5 alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione and medroxyprogesterone (17 alpha-hydroxy-6 alpha-methylprogesterone), while 17 beta-estradiol, testosterone, cortisol, and other related steroids were poor competitors. The adrenocortical nuclear progesterone-binding protein was present to an equal extent in both male and female guinea pigs. The adrenocortical nuclear progesterone-binding protein differed from the classical progesterone receptor in that 1) the affinity of the adrenocortical binding protein for progesterone is an order of magnitude lower; 2) the potent synthetic progestin R5020 binds less tightly to the adrenocortical progesterone-binding protein; 3) the adrenocortical progesterone-binding protein is not modulated by estrogenic activity; 4) the adrenocortical progesterone-binding protein is more stable at 37 C; 5) the adrenocortical nuclear progesterone-binding protein is not salt extractable; and 6) Western blot analysis has revealed that an antiprogesterone receptor monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the guinea pig uterine classical nuclear progesterone receptor, does not recognize the adrenocortical nuclear progesterone-binding protein. Thus, the guinea pig adrenocortical nucleus contains a type of progesterone-binding protein that appears to be clearly different from the classical progesterone receptor.\r"

  ".U": "89210494\r", 
  ".W": "The dog pituitary pars intermedia (PI) appears to consist of relative large numbers of ACTH-containing cells in addition to the more abundant alpha MSH-containing cells. Since regulation of PI secretion probably varies across mammalian species, this study was undertaken to identify substances potentially involved in the control of dog PI POMC peptide secretion and to determine if these substances altered the secretion of immunoreactive (IR) ACTH and IR-alpha MSH in a parallel fashion. Pituitary neurointermediate lobes from dogs were collected and dispersed, and the PI cells obtained were perifused. For comparison, rat PI and pars distalis (PD) cells as well as dog PD cells were similarly collected and perifused. Dog PI cells secreted IR-alpha MSH at a basal rate of 125 +/- 59 (mean +/- SD) pg/min.10(5) cells and IR-ACTH at a rate of 40 +/- 9 pg/min.10(5) cells (molar IR-alpha MSH/IR-ACTH = 10). In contrast, secretion rates for IR-alpha MSH and IR-ACTH from perifused rat PI cells were 171 +/- 108 and 3 +/- 2 pg/min.10(5) cells, respectively (molar IR-alpha MSH/IR-ACTH = 179). Using Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography, virtually all of the IR-beta-endorphin secreted by dog PI cells eluted near beta-endorphin (1-31). In addition, all of the IR-alpha MSH secreted by dog PI cells coeluted with synthetic alpha MSH on the G-50 column, but IR-ACTH appeared in two peaks, one eluting near porcine ACTH-(1-39) and another, apparently larger mol wt species. Dopamine and somatostatin were found to inhibit the secretion of IR-alpha MSH and IR-ACTH from perifused dog PI cells in a parallel and dose-dependent fashion. Norepinephrine and epinephrine similarly inhibited POMC peptide secretion, but this effect was blocked by haloperidol, suggesting that it was mediated through a dopamine receptor. CRF stimulated the secretion of both hormones from dog PI, and this effect was abolished by treatment of the cells with either dopamine or somatostatin. Cortisol had no effect on either basal or CRF-stimulated secretion of IR-alpha MSH or IR-ACTH from dog PI cells, but it did inhibit CRF-stimulated IR-ACTH from perifused dog PD. These results suggest that 1) dog PI secretes considerably more IR-ACTH than that in the rat; 2) the probable separate cell sources of IR-alpha MSH and IR-ACTH in dog PI are regulated in an identical fashion; and 3) dopamine, somatostatin, and CRF may function in the physiological or pathophysiological regulation of dog PI.\r"

Spontaneous [3H]ACh release was increased by depolarizing potassium concentrations, and both synthesis and release of ACh were increased by the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone. Double immunostaining of choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and, respectively, of ACTH, GH, PRL, TSH, S100, LH, and FSH in rat pituitary cells revealed that most of the CAT-immunoreactive cells were also ACTH immunoreactive. A small proportion (less than 10%) of the PRL-immunoreactive cells also showed CAT immunoreactivity, but all other cell types were negative. The immunocytochemical evidence for colocalization of CAT within the ACTH cell was strengthened by the finding of a significantly higher rate of [3H]ACh synthesis in a corticotroph-enriched cell population obtained by separating pituitary cells on a velocity sedimentation gradient. In addition, the mouse pituitary corticotropic cell line AtT20 contained CAT immunoreactivity, converted [3H]Chol to [3H]ACh, and released bioactive ACh-like material. In conclusion, the present data provide strong evidence that pituitary corticotrophs synthesize and release ACh, and that the activity of this intrapituitary cholinergic transmission system is under regulatory control.\r"
