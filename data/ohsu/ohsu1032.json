Diagnosis is made by finding the distinctive barrel shaped eggs in the stool or in the heavily infested patient, by anoscopy and identification of worms attached to reddened and ulcerated rectal mucosa. Mebendazole is the drug of choice in treatment. Capillariasis, a parasitic infection encountered mainly in the Philippine Islands, is of interest in that the eggs may be confused with the eggs of trichuris. Hookworm disease is generally asymptomatic, but in heavy infection, leads to iron deficiency and hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Diagnosis is made by finding the characteristic hookworm eggs on a examination of a direct fecal film. Accidental invasion of humans by dog and cat hookworm leads to cutaneous larva migrans, also known as \"creeping eruption.\" Human hookworm is treated most effectively with mebendazole, while the rash produced by creeping eruption responds to topical thiabendazole. Strongyloides is fairly common in rural areas of the southeastern United States and may be seen in the urban setting among inmates of mental institutions, prisons, and in immigrants who formerly resided in endemic tropical regions. Because of its remarkable capacity for dissemination of larvae throughout the body, this parasite is now recognized as a serious problem for the patient who is immunocompromised. Diagnosis is made by finding larvae in the stool or by the Enterotest. All infected patients should be treated with thiabendazole. I consider the issue on Drugs For Parasitic Infections, published annually or biannually by The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics, to be the single best source of information on the treatment of parasitic diseases for primary care physicians.\r"

Special attention is given to analyzing the temporal behavior of the direct energy transfer reaction for systems in which the dipolar coupling is between a donor and randomly distributed acceptors. This dynamic process is dependent on two competing lengths when the donor and acceptor distribution is determined by the microstructure of the confining system: Rp, the dominant length characterizing the size of the confinement, and R0, which scales the strength of the dipolar coupling. When energy transfer processes are viewed in the context of these two competing lengths, a picture emerges of the microstructure of the confinement that is consistent with and corroborated by other structural probes.\r"

Whether such syndromes could be the result of the development of responsiveness by some cutaneous pain receptors (C-fiber nociceptors) to sympathetic efferent activity as a consequence of the nerve injury was tested in an animal model. After nerve damage but not in its absence, sympathetic stimulation and norepinephrine were excitatory for a subset of skin C-fiber nociceptors and enhanced the responsiveness of these nociceptors to tissue-damaging stimulation. These effects were demonstratable within days after nerve lesions, occurred at the cutaneous receptive terminal region, were manifest in sensory fibers that had not degenerated after the injury, and were mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic-like receptors.\r"

LFA-1 is not constitutively avid for its counter-receptors, intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs)-1 and -2. Cross-linking of the TCR transiently converts LFA-1 to a high avidity state and thus provides a mechanism for regulating cellular adhesion and de-adhesion in an antigen-specific manner. Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of the beta, but not the alpha, subunit of LFA-1 eliminated binding to ICAM-1 and sensitivity to phorbol esters. Thus, LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 was found to be regulated by the cytoplasmic domain of the beta subunit of LFA-1.\r"

In retinal bipolar cells, which lack the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate-gated channel, calcium permeability through non-NMDA channels was examined. Changes in extracellular calcium concentration unexpectedly affected the reversal potential for glutamate-induced currents in a manner consistent with these channels being highly permeable to calcium. External magnesium ions promote desensitization of these non-NMDA channels in a voltage-independent way. Thus, in addition to non-NMDA channels that conduct only sodium and potassium, there is a class that is also permeable to calcium.\r"

The survival of only a proportion of neurons during normal development is thought to be regulated by the limited availability of neurotrophic agents. One such putative trophic agent is ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a polypeptide that promotes the survival of ciliary, sensory, and sympathetic neurons in vitro. In contrast to the results of in vitro studies, however, the daily treatment of chick embryos in vivo with purified human recombinant CNTF failed to rescue any of these cell populations from cell death, whereas CNTF did promote the in vivo survival of spinal motoneurons. Thus, CNTF may not act as a neurotrophic agent in vivo for those embryonic neurons (especially ciliary neurons) on which it acts in vitro. Rather, CNTF may be required for in vivo survival of motoneurons.\r"

In an attempt to reconcile these values, alkane solubility data have been reevaluated to account for solute-solvent size differences, leading to a revised \"microscopic\" hydrophobic effect of 47 cal mol-1 A-2. This value, when used in a simple geometric model for the curvature dependence of the hydrophobic effect, predicts a macroscopic alkane-water surface tension that is close to the macroscopic value.\r"

This product resulted from targeted disruption of the gene, designated eryF (systematic nomenclature, CYP107), that apparently codes for the cytochrome P450, 6-deoxyerythronolide B (DEB) hydroxylase, which converts DEB to erythronolide B (EB).

This pattern of Ca2+ activity is characteristic of an intracellular milieu that behaves as a regenerative excitable medium. The minimal critical radius for propagation of focal Ca2+ waves (10.4 micrometers) and the effective diffusion constant for the excitation signal (2.3 x 10(-6) square centimeters per second) were estimated from measurements of velocity and curvature of circular wavefronts expanding from foci. By modeling Ca2+ release with cellular automata, the absolute refractory period for Ca2+ stores (4.7 seconds) was determined. Other phenomena expected of an excitable medium, such as wave propagation of undiminished amplitude and annihilation of colliding wavefronts, were observed.\r"

A random gas of hard-sphere point scatterers is allowed to condense under the constraint of the solvent fraction and the restraint of the observed Fourier amplitude data. Two applications to real macromolecular examples are discussed. This method produces an approximate outline of the bulk solvent regions and thus yields a low-resolution picture of the unit cell that can be extended to higher resolutions in special cases, such as through the use of molecular replacement or of noncrystallographic symmetry-based phase extension.\r"

The excellent delineation of soft tissue by magnetic resonance imaging enabled recognition of the joint space between the dens and anterior arch of C1 in 14 out of 25 patients. High-signal-intensity tissue was noted immediately superior to the dens in all patients; an anatomic specimen confirmed the fibrofatty nature of this tissue. The medullary space of the dens had lower signal intensity than did the marrow in the body of C2 in more than one half of the cases. Additional thin-section images suggested that this was a partial-volume artifact. Understanding of the normal appearances of structures in this region is necessary to assess correctly the presence or absence of disease.\r"

In the three surviving patients, the occipitoatlantal dislocation was not diagnosed by the initial examiner. Prompt recognition and stabilization are essential to avoid further neurologic injury. Care must be taken not to increase the dislocation. A halo applied before operation facilitates reduction and allows posterior occipitoatlantal fusion to be performed under optimum conditions.\r"

All of the repairs provided reasonable stabilization for lateral bending except for the posterior wiring without methacrylate, and all but the posterior wiring and facet fusion provided reasonable stabilization against axial rotation loading. The supplementation of all of these repairs with polymethylmethacrylate added considerably to the stability of all the constraints. These findings may be useful in clinical decision-making for determining the kind of repairs and postoperative brace protection to use.\r"

This along with cord atrophy, gliosis, and abnormal spine curvature presumably contributed to residual deficit in several patients. One patient underwent a second decompressive procedure for residual cord indentation, which subsequently improved, as seen on his second postoperative magnetic resonance image. Magnetic resonance imaging was useful in distinguishing mechanical problems from intrinsic cord damage or atrophy. Magnetic resonance imaging should be used after operation in patients with residual deficit to detect patients who may be considered for a second decompressive procedure.\r"

The incidence of neurologic injury was not significantly different between multiple noncontiguous and single fractures. Failure to use seat belts and ejection from the vehicle were the main factors associated with multiple noncontiguous spine injuries. Seven major fracture patterns were identified, which accounted for 60% of these injuries.

The removal of transverse processes alone resulted in the production of scoliosis and lordosis. When both transverse processes and facet joints were removed, scoliosis developed rapidly and was considerable. When paraspinal muscles were incised on one side only, however, this resulted in the development of lordosis alone. The convexity of the curve was always toward the operated side, and the apex was almost always at the lowest operated segment. Lordosis was limited to within the operated area. The results of the experiment indicate that scoliosis resulted because of the asymmetry in load transmission through the ribs to the vertebral column in rabbits.\r"

All patients met the criteria for diagnosis of a painful internal disc disruption and/or failed back syndrome and have had a lengthy trial of conservative treatment consisting of rest, physical therapy, back support, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, and guarded activity; this treatment was often supplemented by epidural cortisone injections, pain management, and functional rehabilitation. Patients with prolonged back pain who failed with conservative care after a minimum of 12 months of severely disabling symptoms were selected for surgery on the basis of a positive dynamic discogram reproducing their exact pain and demonstrating a morphologically degenerative disc (internal disc disruption). For the purpose of this study, patients were categorized into three groups and followed up for 15-36 months after the operation. There were no deaths or major complications, and the overall success in achieving measurable diminution of preoperative pain was 80%. This article discusses preliminary conclusions on the efficacy and safety on anterior and anteroposterior fusion for lumbar disc pain.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the significance of regional quantitative computed tomography measurements of bone density with respect to mechanical strength in the human lumbar spine, 58 vertebrae (from 12 males, 10 females) were scanned in vitro with multiple-thin-slice quantitative computed tomography and then compressed to fracture. With computer graphics, 18 specific regions of physical density and 10 combination averages of density were identified within each vertebral body. To ensure the statistical independence of data, the individual vertebral specimens were assigned to one of three groups (T11-L1, L2-L3, or L4-L5). Use of best-subsets procedures resulted in regression models to predict fracture strength. These models used specific regional density values and often the age and sex of the donors. The correlation coefficients that resulted from the multiple regression models ranged from r = 0.88 to r = 0.95. When the density values were multiplied by the minimum cross-sectional area of the vertebral body, similar regional density averages were selected, and the predictive values were slightly improved (r = 0.94-0.97). The heterogeneity of the density samples (measured as standard deviation) in multiple regression fashion also produced strong correlation coefficients (r = 0.88-0.94). The bone density in an anterior cylinder of the midplane region, the location measured most often in quantitative computed tomography densitometry, was strongly correlated (r = 0.85) to fracture load for the T12-L1 group (N = 20), but was not significant for the other two groups of vertebrae. The cancellous bone density from the female data was not found to be significantly different from the male data set.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There are indications, however, that other factors, such as intraneural inflammation, may be of importance in this context. In this article, four cases are presented in which nerve root related pain gradually resolved without any proven change in the mechanical deformation of the involved nerve root. The data presented here suggest that mechanical compression, per se, may not always be the sole cause of radicular pain and dysfunction. These findings suggest that improvement is needed in our understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation.\r"

Of the discs that leaked, 27% demonstrated contact of injected dye with the adjacent spinal nerve. The high rate of leakage may be related to the age of the cadavers. Nonetheless, the contact between substances injected into an intervertebral disc and adjacent neural tissue during discography offers an alternate mechanism of pain reproduction in an incompetent disc. It also suggests that nontoxic agents should be used for discography and that intervertebral discs should be proved competent before chemonucleolysis.\r"

Assessments using subjective and objective criteria at 3-month intervals demonstrated no statistically significant effect with either d-penicillamine or placebo or between them. Thirteen of the 17 patients completing the trial expressed no clear preference. One patient preferred placebo. The remaining three patients who expressed strong preference for d-penicillamine (supported by objective data) subsequently maintained improvement on long-term therapy for up to 5 years.

In fact, the average pull-out strengths for the two groups differed by less than 2%. The pedicular cortex was broken through during hole preparation in 5 of the 16 pedicles: 3 as a result of drilling and 2 secondary to probing. The average pull-out strength of the screws in these five pedicles was 11.0% less than the average pull-out strength of the screws implanted into the contralateral intact pedicles. Although this does not represent a statistically significant difference (P = 0.15), it suggests that damaging the pedicular cortex may weaken pedicle screw fixation.\r"

During physiologic loadings (50-300 N), the pelvis moved as a whole downward and backward. Iliac wings exhibited marked undulation, except for the central part, which showed minor deformations. The sacrum moved downward and rotated forward over an axis 5-9 cm below the promontorium. Removal of the sacroiliac interosseous ligaments eliminated all joint movements and caused a tighter contact between articular surfaces. Removal of the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments had no influence on the pelvic behavior. The magnitudes of deformations as well as their underlying mineral contents were unequally distributed between the two pelvic sides. These results indicate that the sacroiliac interosseous ligaments are the main determinant of sacral movement. Asymmetric load transmittance to the hip joints might be responsible for the mineral content differences between the pelvic sides.\r"

One year after this, she had a similar, but more localized episode in the left eye. She later developed involuntary movements, and two years after initial presentation, a diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was made. Subsequently her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and she died. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. This case demonstrates the insidious nature of the disease and suggests that the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis should be considered in any child or young adult who presents with unexplained retinal vasculitis, maculopathy or chorioretinitis.\r"

Horseshoe breaks and dialyses are pre-existing lesions that should be treated prophylactically prior to miotic therapy. Patients with no predisposing pathology or whose eyes have lattice degeneration or operculated breaks should be warned of possible retinal detachment prior to starting miotics. Not performing a peripheral retina examination prior to prescribing a miotic is acceptable, but not optimal, medical practice. Examining the peripheral retina or obtaining a retina consultation prior to prescribing a miotic may be beneficial to the patient and could be invaluable in the defense of litigation.\r"

To assess this, the signal-averaged electrocardiogram of 48 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation 62 +/- 9 years) with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) after healing of acute myocardial infarction and late potentials were analyzed. Late potentials could be classified into 3 morphologic subtypes: type I late potentials (19 patients, 40%) occurred in the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex; type II late potentials (16 patients, 33%) started before the end of the QRS complex and extended 30 +/- 17 ms into the ST segment; type III late potentials (13 patients, 27%) started after the end of the QRS complex in the ST segment and ended 67 +/- 27 ms after the end of the QRS complex. The amplitude of the late potentials in type III, when compared with types I and II, was significantly lower, whereas the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram in type I, when compared with types II and III, was significantly longer. Computer algorithm based on noise failed to identify most type III late potentials. No difference was noted in age, sex, site of the myocardial infarction, and rate of induced VT among the 3 types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Concomitant pharmacotherapy included antiarrhythmic drugs 31 (79%), vasodilators in 22 (56%) and digoxin in 20 (51%). There was no statistical difference in baseline characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients were followed for a mean of 24 months (range 2 to 72) from implantation. The difference between actuarial survival--77% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years--and projected survival without the AICD (patients who survive without appropriate device discharge)--30% at 1 year and 21% at 2 years--was significant (p less than 0.01 and less than 0.05 at 1 and 2 years, respectively). This study suggests that the AICD improves survival in patients with coronary artery disease despite severely depressed LV function.\r"

  ".W": "Validation of catheter-based intravascular ultrasound imaging has been based on comparisons with histology and digital angiography, each of which may have limitations in the assessment of arterial size and morphology. External, high-frequency ultrasound can accurately determine vessel dimensions and morphology and because, like ultravascular ultrasound, it also provides cross-sectional arterial ultrasound images, it may be a more appropriate technique for the in vivo comparison of arterial dimensions and morphology determined by intravascular ultrasound. Thus, intravascular ultrasound, external 2-dimensional ultrasound, Doppler color-flow imaging and digital angiography were compared for assessment of arterial dimensions and wall morphology at 29 femoral artery sites in 15 patients. Intravascular ultrasound and the other 3 imaging modalities correlated well in determination of lumen diameter (2-dimensional, r = 0.98, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 0.14; Doppler color flow, r = 0.91, SEE = 1.11; angiography, r = 0.95, SEE = 0.91) and cross-sectional area (2-dimensional, r = 0.97, SEE = 0.04; Doppler color flow, r = 0.92, SEE = 0.14; angiography, r = 0.96, SEE = 0.08). However, lumen size measured by Doppler color flow was consistently smaller than that measured by the other 3 imaging modalities. Intravascular ultrasound detected arterial plaque at 15 sites, 5 of which were hypoechoic (soft) and 10 hyperechoic with distal shadowing (hard). Plaque was identified at 12 of 15 sites by Z-dimensional imaging (p = 0.30 vs intravascular ultrasound), but at only 6 of 15 sites by angiography (p = 0.003 vs intravascular ultrasound), only 1 of which was thought to be calcified plaque.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of nicardipine on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function independent of concurrent effects on loading conditions in patients with LV systolic dysfunction due to coronary artery disease, equihypotensive doses of intravenous nitroprusside and nicardipine were administered to 12 patients with congestive heart failure due to previous myocardial infarction (LV ejection fraction less than 0.40). LV micromanometer pressure and simultaneous radionuclide volume were obtained during a baseline period, during nitroprusside infusion, during a second baseline period and during nicardipine infusion. Mean systemic arterial pressure decreased an average of 21 mm Hg with nitroprusside and 19 mm Hg with nicardipine. A greater decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure was observed with nitroprusside (29 +/- 2 to 15 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) than with nicardipine (29 +/- 2 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). There was a decrease in the time constant of relaxation during nitroprusside but not during nicardipine infusion. There was enough overlap in LV volumes in the baseline and nitroprusside periods to compare diastolic pressure-volume relations over a common range of volumes in 4 patients, and enough overlap in the baseline and nicardipine periods in 11 patients. The relation was shifted downward in 3 of 4 patients taking nitroprusside and in 6 of 11 patients taking nicardipine. The relation between end-diastolic pressure and volume was not shifted with nicardipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The preexcitation index has been shown to be useful in determining the mechanism of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and the site of the accessory pathway in atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia. To test whether a preexcitation index could be computed analytically instead of by scanning the whole SVT cycle with extrastimuli, 19 patients with SVT were studied. The new index was computed using the following formula: (AV conduction time during SVT) + (ventriculoatrial conduction time during ventricular pacing at the SVT cycle length) - (SVT cycle length). There was a strong correlation between the preexcitation index determined by the extrastimulus technique and the new index in 15 patients in whom the preexcitation index could be determined (r = 0.99, p less than 0.01). The value on the new index was greater than 90 ms only in patients with dual AV nodal pathways. In the 4 patients in whom the preexcitation index could not be determined by the extrastimulus technique, the new index could differentiate AV reentrant tachycardia (index for 2 patients, 60 and 60 ms, respectively) from AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (index for 2 patients, 100 and 105 ms, respectively). In conclusion, the new index provided help in determining the mechanism of SVT, even when retrograde atrial preexcitation by a ventricular extrastimulus did not occur.\r"

Forty-two patients were evaluated for nonsustained VT. Eighty patients were evaluated for sustained VT: 30 of these had spontaneous sustained VT only while receiving empiric therapy with quinidine or procainamide, whereas the remaining 50 developed spontaneous VT in the absence of antiarrhythmic drugs. All patients underwent programmed stimulation in the baseline state and after procainamide. Four patients had conversion of induced uniform nonsustained VT into the same morphology, but sustained VT after procainamide administration. These responses only occurred in patients evaluated for nonsustained VT. Over 90% of patients presenting with sustained VT had uniform sustained VT induced at the baseline study and after procainamide, regardless of whether the spontaneous arrhythmia occurred only in the presence or absence of antiarrhythmic drugs. There was no significant difference in the change in mode of induction from baseline to procainamide study, regardless of whether patients had developed spontaneous VT only in the presence or absence of antiarrhythmic drugs. One patient with no inducible VT at the baseline study had inducible uniform sustained VT after procainamide administration, and 1 patient with inducible VT at baseline developed spontaneous sustained uniform VT after procainamide administration. Both patients had developed spontaneous sustained VT only while receiving therapy with type IA agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were 59 men and 160 women, aged 19 to 76 years (mean 43). Pliable, noncalcified valves were present in 139 (group 1), and calcified valves or severe mitral subvalvular lesions, or both, in 80 patients (group 2). Atrial fibrillation was present in 133 patients (61%) and 1+ or 2+ mitral regurgitation in 59 (27%). Technical failure occurred with 3 patients in our early experience. There was no cardiac tamponade or emergency surgery. The only in-hospital death occurred 3 days after the procedure in a group 2 premoribund patient in whom last-resort PTMC created 3+ mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation appeared or increased in 72 patients (33%); 3+ mitral regurgitation resulted in 12 patients (6%). There were 3 systemic embolisms. Atrial left-to-right shunts measured by oximetry developed in 33 patients (15%). Immediately after PTMC, there were significantly reduced (p = 0.0001) left atrial pressure (24.2 +/- 5.6 to 15.1 +/- 5.1 mm Hg), mean pulmonary artery pressure (39.7 +/- 13.0 to 30.6 +/- 10.9 mm Hg) and mitral valve gradient (13.0 +/- 5.1 to 5.7 +/- 2.6 mm Hg). Mitral valve area increased from 1.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.0 +/- 0.7 cm2 (p = 0.0001) and cardiac output from 4.4 +/- 1.4 to 4.7 +/- 1.2 liters/min (p less than 0.01). The results mirrored clinical improvements in 209 patients (97%). Multivariate analysis showed an echo score greater than 8, and valvular calcification and severe subvalvular lesions as independent predictors for suboptimal hemodynamic results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exercise subjects completed a 12-week (3 times per week) exercise training program based on guidelines established by the American Heart Association for phase II cardiac rehabilitation programs; control group subjects maintained normal activities. Before and after training, subjects underwent maximal multistage treadmill testing, and measurements were obtained for plasma catecholamine levels at rest and during peak exercise; they completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and General Well-Being Schedule. Weekly symptom frequency of chest pain, arm pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, mood swings, dizziness and syncope were monitored for the 12-week period. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance, multivariate analysis of covariance, and analysis of covariance with repeated measures. Compared with control subjects, the exercise group showed a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in State Trait Anxiety Inventory scores, an increase in General Well-Being scores, an increase in functional capacity and a decline in the frequency of chest pain, fatigue, dizziness and mood swings. No statistically significant differences were noted in catecholamine levels at rest or during peak exercise. These findings support the use of aerobic exercise in the management of symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse.\r"

  ".W": "In 131 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (53 bioprostheses, 78 mechanical), the pressure decrease across the prosthesis was recorded with Doppler ultrasound at a baseline study early postoperatively (mean 11 +/- 5 days) and compared with a repeat measurement 3 to 5 months later. At baseline the hemodynamic state was markedly different, with increased heart rate (89 +/- 14 vs. 74 +/- 13 beats/min, p less than 0.001) and decreased left ventricular ejection time index (367 +/- 21 vs 390 +/- 22, p less than 0.001). A minor and clinically insignificant decrease in pressure decrease with time was found. The 95% confidence interval for the difference was 0.2 to 3.0 and 0.2 to 1.7 mm Hg for the peak and the mean pressure decrease, respectively. The change in pressure decrease was statistically significant for bioprostheses (mean 16 +/- 5 vs 14 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and smaller (less than or equal to 23 mm) valves (mean 17 +/- 4 vs 15 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), whereas no significant changes were found for mechanical valves or valves of a larger size. The change in mean pressure decrease from baseline to the second examination was within +/- 5 mm Hg for 82% of patients. It is concluded that despite a different hemodynamic state in the early postoperative period, the pressure decrease across aortic valve prostheses obtained at this time can be used as a reference for later comparison.\r"

We prospectively studied 31 patients (19 boys and 12 girls, mean age +/- standard deviation 7 +/- 4 years) with postoperative tetralogy of Fallot, by means of right-sided cardiac catheterization, 24-hour Holter monitoring, body-surface and intracavitary signal-averaging (gain 10(5) to 10(6), filters of 100 and 300 Hz) and programmed ventricular stimulation (1 and 2 extrastimuli, 3 basic cycle lengths, right ventricular apex and outflow tract). All patients were asymptomatic and none had documented or suspected ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular late potentials were detected in 10 of 31 patients (32%) and spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias in 12 of 31 patients (39%). No sustained VT was induced by programmed ventricular stimulation but nonsustained VT was induced in 3 patients (10%). Patients with inducible VT more often had late potentials (3 of 3 vs 7 of 28, p less than 0.01), and spontaneous ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) during Holter monitoring (3 of 3 vs 9 of 28, p less than 0.05). To predict VT inducibility, late potentials had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 75%, a positive predictive value of 30% and a negative predictive value of 100%. For spontaneous VPCs, the figures were 100, 68, 25 and 100%, respectively. It is concluded that shortly after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, the presence of both spontaneous VPCs and ventricular late potentials are associated with an increased incidence of inducible VT. Conversely, the absence of VPCs and ventricular late potentials may identify patients at low risk of subsequent ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Twenty (53%) had abnormal scintigraphic findings (group A). Abnormal scans were divided into 3 groups: permanent defects in 6, reversible defects in 7 and slow washout in 7. The remaining 18 patients had normal scintigrams (group N). Group A had a tendency to be older and to have a high prevalence of complicated significant aortic regurgitation. Interventricular thickness plus left ventricular posterior wall thickness (26 +/- 7 vs 17 +/- 2 mm, p less than 0.01) and left ventricular mass (267 +/- 121 vs 133 +/- 39 g, p less than 0.01) were all greater in group A on echocardiography. The mean value of the central aortic pressure in systole was 170 +/- 15 mm Hg in the 7 catheterized patients in group A. Coronary ostial stenoses were present in 2 group A patients who showed reversible defects on scintigrams. These data indicate that the abnormal perfusion detected by imaging in patients with Takayasu arteritis was responsible for a decrease in coronary reserve or myocardial damage, or both, due to long-standing systemic hypertension or aortic regurgitation. Coronary artery disease should be considered if a reversible defect is present.\r"

Subsequent feeding of palm olein or corn oil significantly reduced the total cholesterol (-19%, -36%), the LDL cholesterol (-20%, -42%%) and the HDL cholesterol (-20%, -26%) concentrations, respectively. Whereas the entry level of the ratio of LDL to HDL was not appreciably altered by coconut oil, this ratio was decreased 8% by palm olein and 25% by corn oil. Serum triglycerides were unaffected during the palm-olein period but were significantly reduced during the corn-oil period.\r"

Concentrations of serum total cholesterol (-15%), LDL cholesterol (-8%), Apo B (-10%), thromboxane (-25%), platelet factor 4 (-16%), and glucose (-12%) decreased significantly only in the 15 subjects given palmvitee during the initial 4 wk. The crossover confirmed these actions of palmvitee. There was a carry over effect of palmvitee. Serum cholesterol concentrations of seven hypercholesterolemic subjects (greater than 7.84 mmol/L) decreased 31% during a 4-wk period in which they were given 200 mg gamma-tocotrienol/d. This indicates that gamma-tocotrienol may be the most potent cholesterol inhibitor in palmvitee capsules. The results of this pilot study are very encouraging.\r"

All volunteers took one palmvitee capsule per day for 30 consecutive days. Overnight fasting blood was taken from each volunteer before and after the experiment. Serum lipids and lipoproteins were analyzed by using the enzymatic CHOD-PAP method. Our results showed that palmvitee lowered both serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in all the volunteers. The magnitude of reduction of serum TC ranged from 5.0% to 35.9% whereas the reduction of LDL-C values ranged from 0.9% to 37.0% when compared with their respective starting values. The effect of palmvitee on triglycerides (TGs) and HDL-C was not consistent. Our results show that the palmvitee has a hypocholesterolemic effect.\r"

Nutritional studies were conducted on weanling albino rats of the Wistar/NIN strain for 28 and 90 d. Diets contained 10% of either CPO, groundnut oil (GNO), or refined palm-olein oil (RPO) and adequate amounts of all other nutrients. No adverse effects were observed as judged by growth rate, feed-efficiency ratio, protein-efficiency ratio, net protein utilization, digestibility, fat absorption, nitrogen balance, phosphorus and calcium retention, serum enzymes, and blood hematology, which were comparable with control values. Lipid profiles of the animals of the 28-d study indicated that CPO and RPO had higher amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides than did GNO although tissue lipids were comparable. In the 90-d study, however, lipid concentrations were comparable with control values. These results suggest that CPO has adequate nutritional quality compared with GNO and RPO.\r"

It increased the serum cholesterol concentration compared with safflower oil (SA), but the degree of the elevation was moderate compared with that of olive oil (OL). The proportion of arachidonic acid in tissue lipids was by no means lower on a PA diet than on an SA diet. The ratio of prostacyclin produced by the aorta to thromboxane A2 in plasma was not simply predicted by the dietary level of saturated fatty acid. PA tended to facilitate the utilization of arachidonate for prostacyclin in vitro in peritoneal macrophages compared with SA. Fatty acid profiles of PA rather than the glyceride structure or the tocotrienol appeared to be the major determinant for the specific features of lipid metabolism observed in rats fed PA.\r"

Thus, in a preliminary study designed to evaluate this hypothesis, five dietary lipid supplements--sunflower seed oil (SSO), chemically refined palm oil (PO I), physically refined palm oil (PO II), sheep fat (SF), and a 1:1 blend of SF and fish oil (SF-FO)--were compared for their effects on membrane-lipid composition and eicosanoid synthesis after a 12-mo pre-feeding period. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the myocardium showed significant alterations in response to dietary lipid treatment. Nevertheless, prostacyclin production was unaffected whereas both SF-FO and POI diets caused a significant inhibition of myocardial thromboxane A2 (TXA2). It is speculated that n-3 (omega-3) PUFAs may act as specific inhibitors of TXA2 synthetase whereas the PO I effect is unlikely to be mediated via fatty acids. These preliminary data are worthy of further investigation.\r"

Hypercholesterolemic pigs fed the TRF supplement showed a 44% decrease in total serum cholesterol, a 60% decrease in low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and significant decreases in levels of apolipoprotein B (26%), thromboxane-B2 (41%), and platelet factor 4 (PF4; 29%). The declines in thromboxane B2 and PF4 suggest that TRF has a marked protective effect on the endothelium and platelet aggregation. The effect of the lipid-lowering diet persisted only in the hypercholesterolemic swine after 8 wk feeding of the control diet. These results support observations from previous studies on lowering plasma cholesterol in animals by tocotrienols, which are naturally occurring compounds in grain and palm oils and may have some effect on lowering plasma cholesterol in humans.\r"

After confirmation that a dietary supplement of saturated animal fat (SF) increased the animals' susceptibility to develop cardiac arrhythmia under ischemic stress whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acids of sunflower seed oil (SSO) reduced this susceptibility, we found that diets supplemented with either chemically refined palm oil (PO-I) or physically refined palm oil (PO-II) gave results that were generally intermediate in value between the SF and the SSO groups. However, during reperfusion of a previously ischemic heart, both PO-I- and PO-II-supplemented diets appeared to be as effective as SSO in reducing ventricular premature beats. In addition, the incidence of animals displaying severe ventricular fibrillation was much less after palm-oil feeding than it was after SF feeding. These preliminary results warrant further investigation of the potential antiarrhythmic effects of commercial palm oil.\r"

Accordingly, the biopotency of a palm-oil residue was assessed and expressed as alpha-tocopherol equivalents (alpha-TEs). The release of pyruvate kinase, a variable in the nutrition-linked necrotizing myopathy, into the plasma was dose-dependently inhibited by the RRR-alpha-T standard and the corresponding alpha-TE from this residue. Prostacyclin synthesis from aorta segments induced by thrombin or ionomycin was higher than the spontaneous release. However, there was no difference between the depleted group and groups treated with RRR-alpha-T or alpha-TEs from the palm-oil residue. Quantities of IgG in plasma of vitamin E-depleted rats were the highest. Upon supplementation with RRR-alpha-T or alpha-TEs from the palm-oil residue, reduced IgG concentrations were observed, similar to those of animals on a commercial diet containing adequate amounts of vitamin E.\r"

The increased susceptibility to erythrocyte peroxidation in the smokers may reflect lower glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (P less than 0.02) and glutathione peroxidase (P less than 0.05) activities. Smokers seem to be under a sustained oxidant stress with increased plasma-conjugated dienes (P less than 0.01) and dehydroascorbate (P less than 0.05) and decreased ascorbate (P less than 0.06) concentrations. Additionally, plasma ceruloplasmin in smokers is elevated (P less than 0.01), consistent with an acute-stress response. Plasma total cholesterol is similar in smokers and nonsmokers and is unaffected by vitamin E supplementation.

Experiments on animals have indicated that polyunsaturated vegetable oils promote cancer more effectively than do saturated fats or polyunsaturated fish oils, whereas in the epidemiological data, total dietary fat correlates with cancer incidence and mortality at least as well as does any particular type of fat. Case-control and cohort studies have not shown strong indications of a relationship between dietary fat and cancer, perhaps because of methodological difficulties inherent in such studies.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive. SETTING: A crisis shelter for runaway and homeless youths. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred one residents, aged 13 to 20 years, of a shelter for homeless and runaway youths in Houston, Tex. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS/MAIN RESULTS: A self-administered questionnaire was used to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of these youths regarding infection with HIV. Nearly one fourth had injected illegal drugs; one fifth had shared needles for other purposes. Sixteen percent had had anal intercourse, 19% had engaged in prostitution, and 67% of all subjects reported having four or more sexual partners. One fifth reported that they always use condoms. While quite knowledgeable about means of transmission, they held prevalent misconceptions about casual contact and risk reduction. Youths perceive few barriers to condom use, have fairly high intentions to practice preventive behavior, and have high self-efficacy to do so. Most believe they are at little or no risk for acquiring HIV. These findings support the need for medical, educational, and social service programs to reduce the risk of HIV among these youths. CONCLUSION: Runaway and homeless youths practice behaviors that place them at high risk for acquisition of HIV infection. Risk reduction is imperative and will require programs that address the educational, psychological, social, and medical needs of these youths.\r"

  ".W": "Traditionally, a serum iron concentration in excess of the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is considered as an indication for deferoxamine therapy in acute iron poisoning. We observed a reversible elevation of the TIBC in patients with iron poisoning that coincided with their acute hyperferremia and have hypothesized that this is a laboratory aberration. We tested this hypothesis in vitro and found that the addition of iron to test serum samples produced a related increase in the TIBC, and alteration of the assay by providing additional adsorbent prevented this occurrence. We also evaluated the reproducibility of the TIBC as performed by 500 laboratories on 10 different reference samples. The mean coefficient of variation was 16%, which was unsatisfactory. We concluded that the TIBC should not be used in the decision for the initiation of deferoxamine therapy in acute iron poisoning. Furthermore, high TIBC values that are occasionally seen in patients with iron poisoning should not be considered as providing a protective effect.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, single blinded. SETTING: Urban university hospital ED linked to hospital's primary care center. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of 190 children younger than 8 years who sought care in the ED for acute illnesses and who were treated as outpatients with primary care center follow-up at the discretion of ED clinicians. INTERVENTION: Parents in the experimental group were called by a nurse practitioner who offered both individualized guidance regarding follow-up and access to a nurse practitioner for further help as needed. The control group received \"usual\" follow-up advice during ED visits. MEASUREMENTS/MAIN RESULTS: In the week after the ED visits, parents in the experimental group, compared with parents in the control group, were more compliant with instructions regarding follow-up (79% vs 61%), less apt to miss appointments (15% vs 31%), and less apt to \"shop\" elsewhere for care (2% vs 9%). Appropriateness of follow-up was assessed in \"blinded\" fashion using preestablished guidelines. Inappropriate use of follow-up care was significantly reduced among experimental group subjects (10% vs 20%). CONCLUSION: The nurse practitioner's intervention improved parents' use of follow-up care in our sample. Overall care for episodic ED users might be improved by similar interventions.\r"

The control group consisted of 187 unvaccinated children of similar age and background. During the 6-week study period, influenza A infection was diagnosed in five (3%) of 187 vaccinees and in 29 (16%) of 187 controls. Acute otitis media developed in three (60%) of five vaccinees with an influenza A infection compared with 18 (67%) of 27 controls (excluded were two children with a double viral infection). The incidence of acute otitis media associated with influenza A was reduced by 83% in the vaccinees. The total number of children with acute otitis media in the vaccine group was 35, compared with 55 in the control group, disclosing a 36% reduction among the vaccinees. We conclude that influenza vaccination decreases the incidence of acute otitis media in children during an influenza A epidemic, suggesting also that other vaccines against respiratory viruses may be an effective way to reduce the incidence of acute otitis media.\r"

All of these patients had normal serum calcium, ionized calcium, phosphate, magnesium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, intact parathyroid hormone, and total and extractable calcitonin levels. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D values were low in three patients and slightly decreased in one. Three children were treated with calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) (0.50 micrograms/d in two and 0.25 microgram/d in the other). The fourth patient was not treated because of parental refusal. Therapy reduced the fracture rate. Follow-up at 6 and 12 months showed a significant increase in bone mineralization, which reached normal values in two children after 12 months of treatment. No side effects of calcitriol therapy were observed. The untreated patient did not show an improvement of bone mineralization in the same time.\r"

Dosages were individualized using a computer program, guided by early serum gentamicin assays after a loading dose and a database of population kinetics. Steady-state gentamicin levels achieved were compared with those from a regimen based on guidelines. A total of 26 gentamicin courses were individualized in 19 infants of 22 to 33 weeks' gestation, weighing 500 to 1000 g at 1 to 41 days of age. All steady-state trough levels were between 1 and 2.4 mg/L; peak levels were between 4.4 and 9.3 mg/L. The 95% confidence intervals were in almost identical ranges. The prevalence of toxic and suboptimal trough levels was less when compared with that of 23 gentamicin courses based on guidelines in 17 control infants. We conclude that early individualized gentamicin dosage over a range of postnatal age is a practical alternative and serum level distributions appear superior.\r"

This study demonstrated that two-thirds of services billed by GEs are medical visits, whereas two-thirds of GEs' income is derived from endoscopies. Five endoscopies account for 50% of GEs' allowed charges. Correcting for case-mix and geographic location, GEs' charges for endoscopies are still 10% higher than other physicians performing the same procedures. The second component of the study was a survey of 379 members of three major gastroenterological associations. Demographic and practice characteristics are reported and compared, when possible, with other physician specialties. Respondents estimated they spent 52 h/wk in inpatient and outpatient activities, of which 17.5 h were spent performing endoscopies. Fewer than 50% of respondents billed for 31.4 h of professional activity each week. Medicare patients comprise 38.2% of their patients. Most physicians did not balance-bill, or balance-billed Medicare patients only when they were able to pay. Malpractice premiums have risen from $6,511 to $9,540 during the past 3 yr. Over 95% of respondents were able to correctly identify those conditions requiring upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy and colonoscopy.\r"

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents a potential source of posttransplant morbidity and mortality. To define the scope of this problem, records of all patients undergoing cardiac transplantation at UCLA between January 1984 and July 1989 were reviewed. In all, there were 120 patients (90 males and 30 females) with a mean age of 45.4 yr. Among them, there were 61 patients (51%) who developed a total of 112 posttransplant GI complications. Of the entire 120 patients, 41 (34%) developed minor complications and 20 (17%) sustained major GI morbidity. Eighteen patients (15%) underwent either endoscopy or surgical intervention. These data suggest that most cardiac transplant recipients will experience some form of GI complication, although most are minor and can be managed conservatively. However, when major, life-threatening complications occur, evaluation and intervention should proceed expeditiously. The gastroenterologist and GI surgeon should play complimentary roles in the care of these complicated patients.\r"

This study was designed to investigate the impact of the severe protracted suffering on the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, we studied 623 consecutive patients of Eastern European origin who had been admitted for nongastrointestinal complaints. They filled out detailed questionnaires, and were divided into the following two groups: A) Holocaust survivors [237 subjects who had been for at least 6 months in either German concentration/extermination camps (95 subjects), ghetto and/or underground movements (65 subjects), labor camps not directly supervised by Germans (79 subjects)], and B) a control group (384 subjects from the same demographic background, who had not been exposed to Nazi persecutions). The symptoms investigated were the following: abdominal pain, irregular bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal distension, heartburn, flatulence, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, mucus in stool, tenesmus, and aerophagia. Patients were defined as having functional symptoms after these had been present for at least 5 yr and relevant organic disease had been excluded. The prevalence, duration of suffering, and frequency of appearance of most symptoms were significantly higher in the group of Holocaust survivors. This study supports the clinical observations that severe and protracted suffering contributes to the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptomatology.\r"

  ".W": "Idiopathic gastroparesis (IG), a disorder characterized by abnormally delayed emptying of food from the stomach, is associated with many symptoms that could have an impact on dietary intake. The intake of dietary protein, carbohydrate, fat, fiber, vitamins, and minerals was prospectively evaluated in patients with symptomatic IG and compared with asymptomatic controls. Twenty-four patients and 24 age- and sex-matched controls completed a detailed 7-day diet record while consuming a self-selected diet. Dietary information was entered into a computer and analyzed using the Nutranal program. Results were expressed as daily intake and percent recommended dietary allowance (%RDA) when applicable. Patients consumed a diet containing fewer calories than would have been predicted based on age, height, sex, frame, and weight (85% of calculated energy expenditure vs 100%) for controls. Although patients with IG consumed significantly fewer calories than controls (1112 kcal vs 1431 kcal), the proportion of fat (32% vs 34%), carbohydrate (49% vs 48%), and protein (17% vs 16%) was similar in the two groups. Intake of vitamins B6, vitamin C, folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc were below the %RDA. Intake of vitamin B12, vitamin C, folate, thiamine, niacin, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc were significantly less than controls. Vitamin A intake was above the RDA and not different from that of controls. Prolonged t1/2 of solids correlated with diminished intake of protein, iron, niacin, and potassium. They correlated inversely with serum albumin in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis. Conclusion: Although eating less, patients with IG do not consistently alter the proportion of fat, carbohydrate, and protein in their diets. Because their diet is markedly deficient in a number of essential vitamins and minerals, dietary evaluation and counseling is suggested for all patients with idiopathic gastroparesis.\r"

We retrospectively studied 471 patients admitted to the Department of Traumatology of our hospital who developed shock in their clinical course. Forty-two patients (8.9%) developed gastrointestinal hemorrhage, most within 1 wk (76.2%). The hemorrhage lesion usually was located in the corpus of the stomach. The mortality rate of the shock patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage was 33.3% (14 of 42). Comparison of different types of shock showed that the incidence, severity, and mortality rates of gastrointestinal hemorrhage were significantly higher in septic shock patients than in hemorrhagic shock patients. These findings show the importance of preventive therapy against progression of early mucosal damage and development of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in shock patients, especially those with sepsis.\r"

Endoscopy was performed in the group of three separate patients. Each patient underwent endoscopy, both before the drug was given, and at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, and 36 h. Before the drug was given, endoscopy was normal in all of the patients. However, mucosal erosions developed in four of 18 patients who were endoscoped 24 and 36 h after chloroquine ingestion (gastric, four; duodenal, two; esophageal, one). The same doses of chloroquine failed to produce any mucosal lesions when given to these four patients while they were afebrile and when given to 11 healthy individuals who served as controls. Poor correlation was noted between subjective symptoms and endoscopic findings. In conclusion, neither malaria alone nor chloroquine alone causes mucosal lesions. However, chloroquine administered during malarial fever causes mucosal damage in susceptible individuals.\r"

Fasting patients undergoing initial assessment for H. pylori drank 5 microCi of 14C-urea in 20 ml of water. Breath was collected at intervals for 30 min. Samples were counted in a beta-counter, and the results were expressed as counts per minute (cpm). In the same week, patients underwent endoscopy, and a blinded investigator examined biopsy samples of gastric mucosa by culture and histology for H. pylori. There were 49 H. pylori-negative (HP-) and 104 H. pylori-positive (HP+) patients in the study. HP+ patients expired a mean of 4398 cpm (SD 2468) per mmol CO2 in a sample taken 20 min after ingestion of the isotope. In contrast, HP--patients expired only 340 cpm (SD 196). If the mean +3 SD of HP- patients was used as a cutoff value, the 20-minute sample gave a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100% for detecting H. pylori. The radiation exposure from this test is less than 1% of that received from an upper gastrointestinal series, and the short collection time makes it both convenient and cost effective.\r"

The frequency of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis (63.6%), gastric ulcer (71.9%), and duodenal ulcer disease (73.1%) differed significantly from that in histologically normal individuals (8.2%), confirming the relationship of H. pylori infection with those disease states.

Daily divided corticosteroid doses were given to all patients with active disease that had not been responsive to supportive measures and, in almost all cases, not responsive to sulfasalazine alone. After initial remission was achieved, patients were switched to alternate-day doses. Treatment evaluations utilized global assessment and the CD activity index of Harvey and Bradshaw (CDAI-HB) shown to correlate closely with the National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study (NCCDS) activity index (CDAI). CDAI-HB scores of 0-1 indicated no or minimal activity, whereas scores of 2-15 indicated progressive activity. With the CDAI-HB and global assessments, in agreement in all cases, 33 patients (60%) showed favorable responses with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 46.8 to 73.2. Comparing the results with a literature-based 20% spontaneous long-term remission rate, the data are significant at p less than 0.01. Serious complications were gratifyingly low, with no observed instances of osteonecrosis. It is concluded that alternate-day prednisone treatment and treatment maintenance, with or without concomitant sulfasalazine, after conventional induction of remission with daily steroid doses, is a reasonable treatment option for patients with CD not responsive to sulfasalazine alone.\r"

In our experience, however, a significant number of patients with alcoholic liver disease complain of cold hands. In this study, we have investigated the presence of the subjective feeling of hand temperature in 114 patients with alcoholic liver disease compared with 96 healthy controls, and studied possible correlations of this subjective feeling with the severity of liver disease. Significantly more patients with alcoholic liver disease complained of cold hands than did normals, and these differences were more prominent in the male group. The awareness of cold hands appears to be commoner in an intermediate group of patients, between those with noncirrhotic liver disease without varices and those with cirrhosis with varices. A similar pattern of awareness of hand temperature was found when patients were staged according to the severity of their liver disease. We conclude that a staging can be made; at an early stage of liver disease, patients tend to have warm hands, subsequently develop cold hands, and at a later stage, their hands become warm again.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three children with esophageal varices due to portal hypertension underwent injection sclerotherapy over a period of 6 yr. Thirty-one completed the sclerotherapy course, and the varices were eradicated in all. In nine, the procedure was performed as an emergency because of continued bleeding and, in each case, a gastric fundal varix was the source of the blood loss. Sclerotherapy successfully controlled the bleeding in four of these, whereas five required surgical underrunning of the fundal varix. After surgery, these five continued sclerotherapy until the esophageal varices were eradicated. Complications included transient pyrexia (39%), retrosternal discomfort (30%), esophageal ulceration (18%), and esophageal stricture (12%). Rebleeding before initial eradication of the varices occurred in 12 patients but, thereafter, was very uncommon and always small in amount. Esophageal varices recurred after initial eradication in 33% of cases but were easily sclerosed with further injections. This study demonstrates that sclerotherapy is effective in reducing bleeding frequency in children with portal hypertension, but emphasizes the need for regular follow-up endoscopy after initial eradication of esophageal varices.\r"

Two of seventeen patients in the nonadministered group dropped out of this trial because of development of gastric ulcer, so 18 patients in the first group were evaluated and compared with the 15 remaining patients in the second group. Sclerotherapy was performed with 5% ethanolamine oleate and 0.6% polydocanol; the mean number of injection courses and the mean amount of sclerosant were the same in both groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the two groups in either the occurrence rate or the size of injection ulcer 1 wk after the last session. However, the persistence rate of ulcer 1 month after last injection in the ranitidine-administered group was significantly lower than that in the ranitidine-nonadministered group (6.3% vs. 38.5%, p less than 0.05). Our study demonstrated that ranitidine administration will help to hasten healing of postinjection ulcer, although it was not effective for prevention of injection ulcer.\r"

Patient data were analyzed by grouping into three broad categories based on origin from known high, medium, or low prevalence hepatocellular carcinoma zones. In this fashion, differences in clinical presentation were observed. Asians (N = 12) were younger, invariably presented with pain; 82% had markers of hepatitis B and did not have features of chronic liver disease. In contrast, Westerners (N = 45) were older by more than a decade. One-quarter were HBV positive and almost two-thirds were alcoholic. The clinical presentation of this group was more varied, over one-third presenting with features of decompensated liver disease or variceal bleeds. Mediterranean patients (N = 16) had features intermediary between the two other groups. A logistic regression model clinically separated patients with hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma from those with alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting different ongoing pathogenetic influences.\r"

The mean gamma-GT activity ratio of the bound (peak 2) and nonbound (peak 1) fraction in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly higher than that in patients with liver cirrhosis or in normal controls. Thus, the gamma-GT, which has adjacent cis-hydroxyl groups in its carbohydrate moieties, was found to increase in the serum of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The positivity rate was examined in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis, using a cut-off level for the peak 2:peak 1 ratio of 1.05 (mean + 2 SD of liver cirrhosis). Nineteen (42.2%) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had a ratio of peak 2:peak 1 higher than 1.05. Nine of the 19 patients who had serum alpha-fetoprotein levels below 100 ng/ml had an elevated peak 2:peak 1 ratio. In total, 77.8% of the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma could be detected by a combination of these two markers. Three patients who had developed hepatocellular carcinoma during the course of cirrhosis but remained negative for alpha-fetoprotein throughout the course developed higher levels of peak 2:peak 1 ratio when hepatocellular carcinoma occurred. These results indicate that the two markers, the peak 2:peak 1 ratio of serum gamma-GT activity and serum alpha-fetoprotein level, may be considered to serve as complementary markers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Due to lack of improvement, somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h) was started. During the next few days, there was a rapid improvement of the clinical status, and the production of ascites ceased. We conclude that somatostatin infusion should be tried before any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in patients with pancreatic ascites.\r"

  ".W": "Gastrointestinal involvement occurs frequently in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, and most often involves the liver and spleen. Intestinal involvement is much less common and is generally felt to be a late and often catastrophic manifestation of the disease due to severe vasculitis. Occasionally, the disorder mimics inflammatory bowel disease, both clinically and radiographically. We recently cared for a patient with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia who developed persistent diarrhea. Endoscopic evaluation revealed scattered petechial lesions in the duodenum and colon as well as prominent lymphoid hyperplasia in the terminal ileum. Mucosal biopsies disclosed the presence of diffuse inflammation. We suggest that this patient's diarrhea was due to intestinal vasculitis and that prominent ileal lymphoid hyperplasia may be a manifestation of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of three different doses of prophylactic aerosol pentamidine in patients with one prior episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The design of the study was a double-blind, randomized, dose-comparison clinical trial conducted at 13 medical centers within the United States. In stage I of the trial, patients were randomized to receive either 5 mg, 60 mg, or 120 mg of aerosol pentamidine delivered biweekly with the Fisoneb (Fisons, Inc., Rochester, New York) ultrasonic nebulizer. After 24 weeks of therapy, patients entered stage II of the trial, where the 5-mg group was re-randomized to either the 60-mg or 120-mg group. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five patients entered stage I of the trial and received prophylaxis for a mean of 123.6 days. Seven assigned to the 5-mg biweekly dosing schedule had a confirmed recurrence of PCP, compared with none in the 60-mg group (p = 0.007) and three in the 120-mg group (p = 0.304). During stage II of the trial, eight patients in the 60-mg group and one additional patient in the 120-mg group had recurrent PCP. After 52 weeks of observation, the likelihood of being PCP-free was 88.0% in the 60-mg group and 93% in the 120-mg group (p = 0.712). Minor adverse events related to aerosol pentamidine administration included cough, taste perversion, chest pain, bronchospasm, and dyspnea. These side effects were more common in the 60-mg and 120-mg treatment groups and resulted in withdrawal from the study by one patient. Serious events were more common after 24 weeks of therapy and included asymptomatic hypoglycemia (five), pancreatitis (two), pneumothorax (one), and extrapulmonary pneumocystosis (one). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that biweekly administration of 60 mg or 120 mg of aerosol pentamidine significantly decreases PCP recurrence when compared with a 5-mg regimen or findings in historic controls and is generally well tolerated. There is no significant difference in effect or safety between these two dosing regimens in patients followed for at least 52 weeks of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma generally respond well to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, due to the associated myelosuppression, these patients are at risk for developing complicating infections that may affect survival. We therefore conducted a multi-center randomized clinical trial comparing single-agent against combination chemotherapy in advanced AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Low-dose chemotherapy was employed to evaluate its role in combination therapy for this disease and the toxicities associated with the lower intensity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with extensive mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma or visceral involvement were randomized for treatment with low-dose Adriamycin (doxorubicin, 20 mg/m2) alone (31 cases) or in combination with bleomycin and vincristine (ABV) (30 cases). Patients were randomized within strata based on prognostic features associated with shorter survival in prior studies. Both treatment arms were evenly matched at study entry. RESULTS: Complete and partial tumor remissions were significantly higher with ABV (88%) than with Adriamycin alone (48%) (p = 0.004). The median survival was 9 months in both groups. Study entry criteria significantly associated with shorter survival included CD4 lymphocyte counts less than 100/mm3, hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL, a history of constitutional symptoms, and a prior history of opportunistic infection(s). Toxicities were similar in both arms, and the regimens were well tolerated. Neutropenia (granulocyte count less than 1,000/mm3) occurred in 34% of patients receiving Adriamycin alone and in 52% of patients receiving ABV and was progressive in successive courses of chemotherapy in both treatment arms. The development of AIDS-defined opportunistic infections was relatively infrequent during therapy (14%). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ABV is an effective chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of extensive Kaposi's sarcoma. ABV chemotherapy is associated with significantly higher responses than Adriamycin alone and with acceptable toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The pleiotropic inflammatory effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) prompted a study of this cytokine in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a recurrent polyserositis of unknown etiology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six asymptomatic and 24 patients with acute FMF were studied and compared with 20 matched healthy subjects. TNF levels were measured by bioassay in the plasma and in supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) incubated alone or with an inducer (lipopolysaccharide, phytohemagglutinin [PHA], or Sendai virus). Cytotoxicity could be abolished in all cases by preincubation with monoclonal anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. RESULTS: No TNF was found in plasma and non-induced PBMC supernatants. Induced TNF production was markedly decreased in patients with acute FMF and increased in asymptomatic FMF patients to levels over those of control subjects (p less than 0.05). Thus, PHA-induced TNF levels were 4 U/mL in patients with acute FMF, 25 U/mL in asymptomatic patients, and 14 U/mL in healthy control subjects (median values), and the other inducers gave similar results. Retesting of patients first studied during an acute episode when their disease was quiescent also revealed a fivefold increase in TNF production. These results were independent of the use of colchicine, which also had no effect on TNF levels when taken by volunteers (1 mg/day) or when added to the PBMC cultures (10(-7) M). CONCLUSIONS: Since TNF has a very short half-life in plasma, the capacity of PBMC to respond to TNF inducers may more accurately reflect its synthesis. A marked decrease in this response in acute FMF suggests \"exhaustion\" of cells that are already highly activated to produce TNF and the possible participation of TNF in the pathogenesis of FMF.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The presenting features and the frequency of signs and symptoms were analyzed in 93 homozygotes from 56 families. RESULTS: Hemochromatosis was detected by chance in 40% of the 56 probands. Abdominal pain (16%), joint pains (11%), and weakness (9%) were prominent features that brought the patient to the physician. Although 38% of the male patients had loss of libido and impotence, these were not identified as presenting features. Features of liver disease (84%), arthritis (11%), and diabetes (2%) led the physician to the diagnosis. Impotence and testicular atrophy were notable, by their absence, in alerting physicians to the presence of hemochromatosis. Screening of family members led to the detection of 37 homozygotes, of whom 46% were asymptomatic. Among this group, arthropathy and gonadal failure were the most common symptoms. The classic triad of hepatomegaly, diabetes, and pigmentation was present in only 8% of patients. Clinical features were rare in patients with less than 5 g of exchangeable body iron and invariably present in those with more than 16 g. CONCLUSION: The presenting clinical features of hemochromatosis have changed since the original description of the disease in 1935. Family studies have led to the earlier discovery of more homozygous women and earlier detection with less iron loading and, as a result, fewer signs and symptoms.\r"

In this study, the independent effects of energy restriction and weight reduction were examined prospectively in 24 obese, hypertensive, normoglycemic women whose dietary intake was tightly controlled. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sodium, potassium, and calcium intake, the polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio, and the proportional composition of carbohydrate, fat, and protein were constant throughout the 5-month protocol. Hemodynamic and neuroendocrine status was evaluated in four 10-day hospital phases: two prior to weight loss (energy balance and then 800-kcal intake), and two after an average loss of 13 kg to normal body weight (800 kcal and then return to energy balance). RESULTS: Fasting serum insulin, triiodothyronine:reverse triiodothyronine ratio, resting metabolic rate, and heart rate declined, and sodium and potassium balances were negative during energy restriction. Catecholamines, renin, aldosterone, plasma volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure showed no consistent response to changes in energy intake. By contrast, weight reduction independently lowered blood pressure, plasma volume, cardiac output, and plasma renin activity. Body fat pattern remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that weight loss has a blood pressure-lowering effect that is distinct from energy restriction and that is related to changes in blood volume and cardiac output.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to compare the powder and the bar forms of cholestyramine to determine efficacy and patient compliance. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized trial was conducted that included 83 healthy men and women with hyperlipidemia greater than the 90th percentile for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or total cholesterol. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either cholestyramine powder, two packets (8 g), twice daily, or cholestyramine confectionery bar, in maple or mint flavors, two bars (8 g), twice daily. Fasting serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at baseline, after 6 to 8 weeks of following the American Heart Association Step I diet alone, and after 8 weeks of taking either the cholestyramine bar or powder. RESULTS: Total cholesterol decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) by 16% in the bar group and 17% in the powder group. LDL cholesterol decreased by 28% and 29% in the bar and powder groups, respectively (p less than 0.01). There was no significant change in HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides increased in both groups, by 29% in the bar group and by 25% in the powder group. There was no difference between bar and powder in the effect on blood lipids. The majority of the lipid-lowering effect was seen within 14 days. Mean patient endpoint compliance with the therapy was 91.8 +/- 3.6% in the bar group and 94.8 +/- 2.1% in the powder group. There was no difference between groups. CONCLUSION: The cholestyramine confectionery bar is as effective as cholestyramine powder in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The majority of the lipid-lowering effect is seen within 14 days of therapy. Although patient compliance is comparable between the two forms, gastrointestinal side effects were slightly greater with the bar form. Therefore, although the bar offers an alternative form of therapy, there appears to be no advantage with regard to patient compliance or palatability.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 50 patients, 30 with PMR alone and 20 with associated GCA. Determinations of IgG and IgM aCL by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were done in the patients and in 50 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. We also measured von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. RESULTS: Twenty-four (48%) of the 50 patients had aCL. Eleven were positive for IgG and five for IgM, whereas eight were positive for both. In the group of patients with PMR alone, only eight (26.6%) had aCL, while 16 of 20 patients (80%) with GCA had these antibodies (p less than 0.01). In the control group, 10 of 50 patients (20%) had positive aCL, a finding that was statistically significantly different only when compared with the finding in patients with GCA (p less than 0.01). Both isotypes of aCL were seen mainly in patients with GCA, and five of these patients had severe vascular complications. Levels of vWF antigen were significantly higher in patients with GCA as compared with patients with PMR alone; however, the highest titers did not correlate with vascular complications. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were increased but comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that aCL are prevalent in patients with GCA. These antibodies might imply severe vascular damage and could play an important role in the pathogenesis of the vasculopathy observed in this disease.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stroke were subdivided into 193 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 91 with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 337 with cerebral infarction. Data on recent alcohol consumption were obtained by questionnaire in patients with stroke and compared with data from an occupational screening survey in control subjects. RESULTS: Relative risks, adjusted for confounding variables, exhibited J-shaped associations with increasing levels of alcohol consumption classified into four categories--abstainer, 1 to 90 g, 100 to 390 g, and greater than or equal to 400 g weekly). The individual risks were 1, 0.7, 0.5, and 1.3 for subarachnoid hemorrhage; 1.0, 0.6, 0.5., and 2.5 for intracerebral hemorrhage, and 1.0, 0.6, 0.7, and 2.4 for cerebral infarction for men and women combined. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that low levels of alcohol consumption may have some protective effect upon the cerebral vasculature, whereas heavy consumption predisposes to both hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke.\r"

Extensive clinical evaluation led to the discovery of splenomegaly and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent splenectomy as well as liver and lymph node biopsy. Histologic examination of the lymph nodes, but not the liver and spleen, revealed inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes. The patient has remained asymptomatic for more than 3 years following the surgical procedure despite the absence of further intervention. Inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes should be considered in the differential evaluation of prolonged or relapsing fever of unknown etiology.\r"

Based upon their studies of regional clustering of the ancestors of related patients in eastern Kentucky, the authors have postulated the existence of an inherited disease susceptibility for IgA nephropathy. They examined serum concentrations of individual complement proteins and phenotypes for C3, C4A, C4B, and factor B (Bf) for related and unrelated patients with IgA nephropathy from Kentucky and for patients from the Mid-South region of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama. In these populations, they have described partial complement deficiencies or specific phenotypes which may be associated with the disease. Their findings include the following: (1) partial deficiencies for C2, beta 1H (H), properdin (P), or C4 binding protein (C4BP) in four patients with end-stage renal disease, (2) an association between the C3*F allele with IgA nephropathy in the combined group of unrelated patients from Kentucky and the Mid-South, (3) the occurrence of C4B deficiency in two siblings with IgA nephropathy, and (4) an association between C4A deficiency and poor outcome in patients with IgA nephropathy diagnosed as adults. In addition, the related patients differ from the unrelated patients from Kentucky with respect to frequencies of Bf*F and the BfF (FF + FS + F1F + F1S) phenotype, suggestive of immunogenetic difference between these groups. Important functional differences exist between C4A and C4B isotypes and functional differences are also possible based upon C3 or Bf phenotype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, increased activation of the gene regulating the synthesis of a heat shock protein has been found in scleroderma fibroblasts. As an infection-induced model for other rheumatic diseases, rheumatic fever (RF), with its well-established link to prior group A streptococcal infection, will be revisited. The lessons learned from RF and other rheumatic diseases directly linked to infection will be applied to ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and polymyositis, for which a mounting body of circumstantial evidence suggests a probable infectious cause. The interplay of genetic susceptibility and infection with particular organisms and the implications of this new information for present and future therapy of the rheumatic diseases will also be presented.\r"

Success or failure of treatment was determined by the ratio of DA to leukemic cell load. Accordingly, in the present study we examined the hypothesis that treatment with cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) to reduce the leukemic cell load coupled with Imuvert would be more effective than either given alone. Treatment with ARA-C-Imuvert aborted the development of chloroleukemia in 79% of the animals in contrast to 0%, 9% and 45% in animals treated with buffer, ARA-C, or Imuvert respectively. These results suggest that stimulation of endogenous DA in combination with cytoreductive agents offers a potentially curative treatment for myelogenous leukemia.\r"

Plasma E/alpha levels declined in all eight patients whose initial values were more than 300 ng elastase per ml. Whole blood viscosity (wbv) was reduced by two months' treatment in 12 of 14 patients tested. The relative change in wbv was significantly related to the relative change in E/alpha (R2 = 0.8), for patients with elevated initial E/alpha levels, suggesting a common or related mechanism for the two effects. Plasma crosslinked fibrin D-dimer fragments (XDP) measured by ELISA as indicators of coagulation activity were lower compared to pretreatment levels in 9 of 10 samples drawn when symptoms were improved on PTF, whereas they were increased in 6 of 9 samples drawn when symptoms were worse or unchanged. Plasma viscosity, C-reactive protein and alpha 1-acid-glycoprotein did not change significantly with PTF treatment. Together these findings are consistent with the possibility that reduced microvascular neutrophil activation and coagulation play a role in the clinical efficacy of PTF in intermittent claudication.\r"

We studied the correlation between mean flow velocity and pulsatility index in guided pulsed Doppler waveforms obtained from these three vessels in 83 healthy term newborn infants. The mean flow velocity was derived from the area under the velocity curve, the pulsatility index was calculated by dividing the difference between the peak systolic and end diastolic flow velocities by the peak systolic flow velocity. The pulsatility index correlated very poorly with the mean flow velocity in the 3 cerebral vessels under study. In a clinical setting mean flow velocity and not the pulsatility index should be used as an indirect indicator of cerebral blood flow in infants.\r"

The animals were fed diets containing 0.8 mg cholesterol/kcal or 0.03 mg cholesterol/kcal for five years. Within each dietary cholesterol group, animals received 42% of dietary calories as fat, enriched with either saturated or polyunsaturated fat. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration was found to be the best plasma lipid predictor of the bile cholesterol saturation index. When the cholesterol saturation index of a fasting gallbladder bile specimen was compared to the plasma HDL cholesterol level for individual animals, a significant positive correlation was noted for animals fed polyunsaturated fat, (r = 0.68) and for animals fed saturated fat (r = 0.72). For any value of HDL cholesterol, however, the cholesterol saturation index was higher in animals fed polyunsaturated fat compared to saturated fat. Since plasma HDL cholesterol levels were positively correlated with the bile cholesterol saturation index in adult male African green monkeys, we conclude that a metabolic link exists between plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations and bile cholesterol saturation, perhaps due to enhanced delivery of cholesterol to the liver by HDL.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the expression of oncogene-encoded mRNAs in a rat model of colon cancer. In this model, rats are intrarectally administered several low doses of the direct-acting carcinogen, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Tumors, predominantly adenomas, develop 5-7 months following administration of the carcinogen, and many of these progress to carcinomas. Upon assaying the steady-state levels of oncogene-encoded transcripts in normal rat colon, we found that fos and N-myc are highly expressed; H-ras, K-ras, myc, myb, and neu messages are present at lower levels; and N-ras, abl, and raf mRNAs are absent. When we compared transcript levels in rat tumors to those in normal colons from the same animal, we observed a 2-4 fold increase in both myc- and H-ras-encoded mRNAs and a 2-7 fold increase in myb message, but no change in expression of any of the 7 other genes. To test whether this increased expression is related to tumor production or is simply a result of the more rapid cellular turnover observed in tumor tissue, the level of oncogene-encoded transcripts was assayed in colonic mucosae of rats given two treatments known to enhance cell turnover and DNA synthesis in the colon. Neither acute application of MNU nor a diet containing 1% cholic acid caused any change in the level of oncogene-encoded mRNAs in rat colons, thus suggesting that the increased abundance of myc, myb, and H-ras messages in tumors is associated with tumor formation. The enhancement of expression of these genes in adenomas, as well as in carcinomas, further suggests that these alterations occur relatively early during the tumorigenic process.\r"

The average duration of treatment was 87 days (range 22-204 days). 5-fluorouracil could be infused 66% of the planned time on treatment, and patients received an average of 60% of the planned interferon injections. Objective tumor responses were seen in 6 of 17 previously untreated patients (35%). Twenty-two of the 24 patients (92%) experienced toxicity (greater than or equal to ECOG grade II) that required treatment interruption and subsequent dose reduction predominantly for the following reasons: mucositis (67%), hand-foot syndrome (21%), and leukopenia (25%). The incidence of treatment limiting toxicity is higher than previously observed with 5-fluorouracil infusion alone. This suggests true augmentation of 5-fluorouracil effect by interferon. 5-Fluorouracil infusion and alpha interferon is a potentially useful combination that needs further evaluation in future phase II and phase III trials.\r"

The use of these techniques by Tulsa physicians was assessed through a survey of private practice internists, internal medicine residents, and family practice residents in a university-based community hospital. The majority of physicians (85%) reported they brought up the subject of smoking with their patients. Other techniques were used less frequently, with 34% of physicians never giving their patients self-help materials, 83% never using a quit date contract, and 73% never making appointments mainly to discuss smoking. Private practice physicians reported using more techniques than did the residents. Internists who practice a subspecialty reported using fewer techniques, and this was especially true in the younger physicians. Ten percent of physicians were often satisfied with their efforts, and 14% had formal training in smoking counseling techniques. Some physicians apparently learn how to better use these techniques as their experience increases. Training physicians while they are in residency and early subspecialty practice may accelerate this process and enable more smokers to quit with their physicians' help.\r"

To date, a single case report of transfusion associated KS in an HIV-infected female has been described in the medical literature. We report a second case. A 54-year-old HIV-infected female without other identifiable risk factors for AIDS developed disseminated KS six years after a blood transfusion. Her illness was marked by rapidly proliferating tumors not responsive to a single course of chemotherapy. Another unusual aspect of this case is that, in conjunction with weight loss and diarrhea, Campylobactercinaedi was recovered from her blood. This enteric pathogen has previously been described exclusively in homosexual men. Autopsy studies showed KS tumors involving all major visceral organs. This case report demonstrates that in HIV-infected females KS may follow an aggressive course similar to that seen occasionally in male KS patients with profound immunosuppression.\r"

Alopecia did not regress after the metabolic state improved following insulin therapy. Biopsy of the scalp skin revealed significant reduction of the total number of hair bulbs and prominent lymphocyte infiltration into the remaining hair follicles. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and alopecia areata universalis are both thought to be related to the autoimmune mechanism and sometimes coexist. However, simultaneous development of these two disorders is extremely rare.\r"

At the same time, it is clear that there are major epidemiologic, physiologic, and clinical differences between early postmenopausal and older individuals. These considerations raise the issue of the appropriateness of generalizing evaluation and treatment recommendations from younger to older patients. This review will focus on the age-related changes in bone physiology as it relates to osteoporosis and consider the available evidence for using commonly used (calcium) or approved (estrogen and calcitonin) agents in the elderly patient.\r"

Of the 47 patients in the study, 24 were girls and 23 were boys; 23 patients had bilateral surgery. Seven of the epigrafts required removal; two were not replaced, and five underwent successful repeat epikeratoplasty. Overall, the success rate (that is, the percentage of epigrafts that remained optically and functionally clear throughout the course of this study) for the epikeratoplasty procedure was 89% (62 of 70 eyes) for initial surgery and 96% (67 of 70 eyes) for repeat surgery. The average spherical equivalent was +14.4 +/- 3.7 diopters preoperatively and +0.3 +/- 2.9 diopters one year after the operation. One year after the final surgical procedure, 42 of 56 eyes (75%) were within 3 diopters of emmetropia. In the 29 verbal patients, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 25 (86.2%) one year after the operation.\r"

During vitamin A supplementation (25,000 IU/day), serum levels of vitamin A became low normal, the electroretinogram returned to normal, and the overall contrast sensitivity function improved by 94%.

The follow-up period ranged from six to 99 months (average, 29 months). Visually significant nuclear sclerosis was present preoperatively in three of the operated on eyes and four of the fellow eyes. The rate of occurrence or progression of visually significant nuclear sclerosis was far greater in the operated on eyes (P less than .0001). Of 100 patients, 80 operated on eyes and 24 fellow eyes had visually significant nuclear sclerosis or had undergone previous cataract extraction at the conclusion of the study. Different concentrations of glucose in the intraocular irrigating solution did not affect occurrence of later nuclear sclerosis. Patients older than 50 years of age had a far greater incidence of later nuclear sclerosis than patients younger than 50 years of age (P = .0003). Nuclear sclerosis may be caused by altered lens metabolism after removal of part of the vitreous gel, since nuclear sclerosis also occurs in other conditions associated with vitreous liquefaction.\r"

The infant had bilateral retrolental fibrous vascular masses and retinal detachment with no other apparent physical abnormalities and no family history of ocular defects. A vitrectomy and a membrane peeling were attempted, and specimens of the retina, the retrolental membrane, and a vascularized epiretinal peripheral mass were examined by light and electron microscopy. The retrolental membrane was composed of layered collagenous tissue and contained structures resembling blood vessels. Inner and outer neuroblastic layers were identified in the retinal tissue, but no vessels were present. In the epiretinal mass, portions of retina and cortical vitreous were seen along with primitive vascular structures. The histologic appearance of these specimens suggests that the major pathologic event of Norrie's disease occurs in the retina in the third to fourth gestational month. We believe the subsequent ocular abnormalities found in this patient were secondary to this early retinal malformation and did not represent a progressive ocular disorder.\r"

With spectral electroretinography, the predominant signal was from the S cones. With dark-adapted perimetry, all patients had severely reduced rod sensitivities and subnormal midspectral cone sensitivities. With S cone perimetry, the patients had normal or subnormal S cone function. Sensitivity differences between S and midspectral cones were significantly different from normal; there was relatively higher sensitivity to S cones compared to midspectral cones throughout the visual field. This relationship of dysfunctional cone mechanisms in the Goldmann-Favre syndrome is similar to that in the enhanced S cone syndrome, a recently identified retinal degeneration with S cone hypersensitivity. The results suggest that the Goldmann-Favre and the enhanced S cone syndromes are linked by a common pattern of retinal dysfunction.\r"

Corneal ulcers and severe adverse reactions occurred two to four times more frequently in extended-wear cosmetic soft and rigid gas-permeable lens wearers than in cosmetic daily-wear lens wearers. Aphakic extended-wear soft lens users were nine times more likely to develop a corneal ulcer when compared to the soft daily-wear cosmetic group. Corneal abrasions and keratitis accounted for 81 of 159 severe adverse reactions, whereas corneal ulcers accounted for 28 of 159 adverse reactions. The data indicate that overnight extended wear of contact lenses is associated with a greater risk of serious, sight-threatening complications than daily wear.\r"

The initial sign of glaucomatous damage was diffuse enlargement of the optic disk cup in ten of 23 eyes or generalized thinning of the nerve fiber layer without localized changes in 12 of 23 eyes. We found localized optic disk damage in ten of 23 patients and localized retinal nerve fiber layer damage in 11 of 23 patients alone or in combination with diffuse damage. In 13 of 23 eyes, the cupping ended up in diffuse enlargement with even more profound thinning of the neural rim in the upper and lower temporal disk margins.

This complication may be prevented by early face-down positioning of the patient after the operation, and the avoidance of large, centrally located, inferior iridectomies.

Local production of IL-1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of various vascular diseases. Therefore the ability of intact vascular tissue to accumulate IL-1 mRNA and synthesize de novo biologically active IL-1 protein was examined. Escherichia coli LPS (10 micrograms/kg) was administered intravenously to adult rabbits and total RNA was isolated from aortic tissue at various times after LPS injection. In saline-injected rabbits, RNA extracted from the thoracic aorta contained little or no IL-1 message detected by Northern analysis using IL-1 alpha and beta cDNA probes cloned from an LPS-stimulated rabbit splenic macrophage library. Lipopolysaccharide treatment promptly induced transient accumulation of mRNA for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta within the aorta (maximal 1-hour after injection). Short-term organoid cultures of rabbit aorta exposed to LPS in vitro synthesized immunoprecipitable IL-1 alpha protein. Extracts of aortic tissue excised 1.5 to 3.0 hours after intravenous LPS administration contained immunoreactive and biologically active IL-1 alpha. Anti-rabbit IL-1 alpha antibody neutralized the biologic activity (more than 90%). Microscopic and immunohistochemical studies did not disclose adherent or infiltrating macrophages in rabbit aorta at the time of maximal IL-1 mRNA accumulation after LPS administration (1.5 hours), indicating that intrinsic vascular wall cells rather than mononuclear phagocytes probably account for the IL-1 activity induced by LPS. In addition, aortic tissue from rabbits fed an atherogenic diet showed an enhanced ability to accumulate IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA and produce immunodetectable protein in response to LPS administration. These studies demonstrate inducible IL-1 gene expression in rabbit vascular tissue in vivo and support a local role for this cytokine in vascular pathophysiology.\r"

This hyperplasia, first detectable in AKR/J mice by 4 weeks of age and in AKR/C mice by 4 to 5 months of age, is characterized by an enlarged thymic medulla that contains T and B lymphocytes. In contrast to the general population of thymocytes, most of these T and B lymphocytes have a mature immunophenotype that includes expression of high levels of the MEL-14-defined (gp90) 'homing receptor' for peripheral lymph node high endothelial venules. In vivo homing studies reveal a marked increase in traffic of peripheral lymphocytes (T more than B) to the hyperplastic thymuses of old AKR mice as compared to histologically normal thymuses of age-matched BALB/c and C57BL/Ka mice or young AKR mice. These changes correlate chronologically with changes in retrovirus antigen expression in AKR thymuses and suggest a role for the traffic of lymphocytes from the periphery to the thymus in response to local antigenic stimulation in the pathogenesis of thymic hyperplasia in AKR mice.\r"

The presence of EBV was documented in various PTLD-involved organs. The hybridization signal for the virus localized predominantly in the abnormal lymphoid cells, but signals also were detected in hepatocytes and/or adrenal cortical cells in five cases. The distribution of autoradiographic label within the lymphoid cells was focal and its intensity varied from field to field suggesting a nonuniformity of the viral genomic load in the infected tissues. Recruitment of EBV genome-bearing cells was not observed into inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates found in organs without histopathologic evidence of PTLD.\r"

Here we demonstrate the purification of HGF from human placenta with heparin-agarose chromatography and TSK-heparin high-pressure liquid chromatography and describe the distribution of placental HGF by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody to HGF. The yield of HGF from the placenta was approximately 100 to 200 times greater than that previously obtained from human plasma. Placental HGF was expressed strongly in the villous syncytium, extravillous trophoblast, and amnionic epithelium, and, to a lesser degree in endothelial cells and villous mesenchyme. Hepatocyte growth factor also was identified in the trophoblast of complete hydatidiform moles, choriocarcinomas, and a case of blighted ovum. The presence of HGF in an organ characterized by rapid cell proliferation during gestation and in trophoblastic tumors strongly suggests that the growth-regulating effect of HGF is not limited to hepatocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The development of an intimal proliferative lesion after balloon catheter de-endothelialization was studied in congenitally athymic nude rats lacking T lymphocytes. Significant intimal thickening was observed in both the homozygous (nu/nu) and euthymic heterozygous (nu/+) animals 6 days after injury, which increased further after 10 days. There was no significant difference in mean intimal:medial cross-sectional area between the nu/nu and nu/+ animals at either time. Approximately 1% of the cells in the neointima of both groups of animals were leukocytes (OX-1 positive); 0.7% were macrophages (ED-1 positive). In neither nu/nu nor nu/+ animals did T lymphocytes (OX-19-positive cells) constitute more than 0.1% of the neointimal cell population. These data suggest that T lymphocytes do not play a significant role in the accumulation of neointimal cells. The presence of macrophages within the lesions raises the possibility that they may be involved in the recruitment and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. In vitro characterization of nu/nu carotid medial smooth muscle cells demonstrated approximately 500,000 binding sites for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and few PDGF-AA binding sites (less than 10,000). The mitogenic and chemotactic responses of these cells to the three dimeric forms of PDGF correlated with this receptor subunit distribution. Platelet-derived growth factor accounted for approximately 50% of the mitogenic activity of a rat platelet releasate. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB and PDGF-AB were both potent chemotactic agents for the nude rat carotid smooth muscle cells with a peak response at approximately 10 ng/ml. In contrast, PDGF-AA, transforming growth factor beta, and basic fibroblast growth factor were only weak chemoattractants for these cells.\r"

The expression of cingulin in human normal and neoplastic colonic tissue has been investigated with an antiserum against chicken cingulin. Human cingulin shares its apparent molecular mass and localization with avian cingulin. In normal colonic epithelium, villous adenomas, and differentiated adenocarcinomas, cingulin staining is observed in the junctional region of the polarized cells lining the surface, the crypts, and the glandular lumina. In poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, labeling also is observed at the interface between cancer tissue and stroma, or in clumps of malignant cells, forming a pattern that highlights the presence of small, compressed lumina. The cingulin content of four adenocarcinomas, estimated by immunoblotting and densitometry, was higher than that of the normal tissue (150% to 230%). Cingulin was detected in a metastasis from a colon adenocarcinoma but not in nonepithelial tissues and neoplasias, suggesting that cingulin may be a useful marker in the characterization of colonic and probably other epithelial neoplasias.\r"

The identity and localization of cells found in transplantation-associated arteriosclerosis lesions from human cardiac allografts were evaluated, and their expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (human leukocyte antigen-DR [HLA-DR]), surface molecules required for recognition of foreign cells by CD4+ T lymphocytes, was noted. Expanded intimas of transplanted coronary arteries contain T lymphocytes (both CD4+ and CD8+ in approximately equal number) and HLA-DR+ macrophages, both localized primarily in a ring immediately below the luminal endothelium, a distribution strikingly different from that in typical atherosclerosis. Coronary arterial endothelium from six of six transplanted hearts studied bore high levels of HLA-DR. Normal human arteries or usual atherosclerotic lesions have few if any HLA-DR+ endothelial cells. The significance of these findings was tested by evaluating the ability of HLA-DR+ arterial cells to interact with allogeneic T cells in vitro. Endothelial cells (but not smooth muscle cells) cultured from human arteries stimulated foreign CD4+ T cells to proliferate and augmented their secretion of interleukin-2. These findings suggest that ongoing stimulation of recipient T lymphocytes by HLA-DR+ endothelium of donor coronary arteries contributes to a sustained regional immune response. Consequent local release of cytokines may regulate smooth muscle cell proliferation and matrix accumulation within the coronary arteries of allografted hearts.\r"

  ".W": "P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has emerged as the central mediator in classic multidrug resistance in model systems in vitro. High levels of Pgp also have been detected in many normal human tissues and tumors; and its role in clinical drug resistance is currently under investigation. Recently significant levels of Pgp were localized to gravid and secretory endometrium; and it was demonstrated that the combination of estrogen and progesterone is sufficient to induce high levels of both Pgp mRNA and Pgp in uterine secretory epithelium. These findings suggest that increased Pgp expression also may be present in hormone-responsive malignancies such as endometrial adenocarcinoma. To determine whether Pgp is expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma, 36 endometrial adenocarcinomas (grade I [n = 17]; grade II [n = 6]; grade III [n = 13]) were investigated retrospectively by the avidin-biotin-complex immunohistochemical procedure using three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) MAb C219, MAb C494, and MAb JSB-1, which recognize spatially distinct cytoplasmic epitopes of Pgp. Seventy-two percent of the tumors showed positive immunostaining with at least one MAb; 67% showed immunostaining with MAb C219, 50% with MAb C494, and 62% with MAb JSB-1. Forty-six percent of tumors were immunoreactive to two and 29% to all three antibodies. Membranous and Golgi/paranuclear type staining patterns were observed. Overall the intensity of immunostaining varied from one sample to another for a given tumor type, and considerable heterogeneity of expression was commonly seen within a given tumor. Strong to moderate immunoreactivity was seen in diffusely infiltrating, adenosquamous, and serous papillary carcinomas. In general, immunoreactivity to MAb C494 was weaker than MAb C219 or MAb JSB-1. Adenomatous and non-neoplastic endometrium adjacent to the tumors displayed strong membranous immunostaining with MAb JSB-1. Endometrial capillaries showed weak-to-moderate immunostaining to all three antibodies. It is concluded that Pgp is commonly expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma and may be a significant factor responsible for their drug-resistant nature subject to modulation by progesterone.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of the nuclear phosphoprotein p53 was studied immunohistochemically in a series of 150 benign and malignant colorectal tumors. Using monoclonal antibody PAb1801, tumors divided unequivocally into two groups on the basis of immunohistochemistry. Forty of the carcinomas (46.5%) showed positive staining but only 4 of the adenomas (8.7%) were positive (P less than 0.001). The few positive adenomas always showed moderate or severe dysplasia. Metaplastic polyps (n = 9) and small familial adenomatous polyposis-related adenomas (n = 9) were uniformly negative. Carcinomas with p53 expression did not differ from those without in terms of site, differentiation or the prognostic indicators of Dukes' stage, DNA ploidy, or tumor histology. The improved morphologic resolution available in periodate lysine paraformaldehyde dichromate (PLPD)-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue permitted several conclusions to be made: p53 is confined to neoplastic nuclei; staining in positive tumors is heterogeneous and often more marked at the infiltrative margins; and staining intensity is dramatically reduced in mitotic cells. It is concluded that expression of immunohistochemically detectable p53 (probably representing mutated forms of the protein) occurs in some adenomas around the time of transition to carcinoma. Therefore there is an association with the appearance of infiltrative behavior but not with degree of tumor progression (including metastasis) at the time of resection.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)/inducible cell adhesion molecule 110 is a mononuclear leukocyte-selective adhesion molecule, expressed on vascular endothelium following activation by certain cytokines or endotoxin. This inducible transmembrane protein and member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily was previously reported to contain six immunoglobulinlike domains. Using the polymerase chain reaction, a VCAM-1 cDNA was obtained from mRNA of interleukin-1 (IL-1)-treated cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The cDNA clone contained an additional 276 base-pair (bp) domain, located between domains 3 and 4. This new domain is most homologous to the existing N-terminal domain (domain 1). The internal 276-bp region is encoded by a single exon of the human VCAM-1 gene, indicating that the two forms of mRNA arise by alternative splicing. Both forms of VCAM-1 mRNA were detected by polymerase chain reaction in IL-1-stimulated HUVEC, although the seven-domain form appeared predominant. On the surface of HUVEC only a 110-kd polypeptide, consistent with the seven-immunoglobulinlike domain form of VCAM-1, was detectable by immunoprecipitation. Alternative splicing of the VCAM-1 gene in cytokine-activated endothelium may generate functionally distinct cell-surface adhesion molecules.\r"

The technique used employs the polymerase chain reaction to amplify portions of the rearranged T-cell receptor beta chain genes, using primers recognizing conserved sequences of the variable, diversity, and joining region segments. We examined 17 cases of T-cell lymphoma or leukemia; a clone was identified in 13 cases (76%) overall and in 7 of 8 cases (87.5%) in which both beta-chain alleles were known to be rearranged, as shown by restriction enzyme analysis. No clonal rearrangements were detected in samples from 13 non-T-cell disorders, including B-cell lymphomas, reactive lymphoid proliferations, and nonlymphoid tumors. This method is useful for detecting clones in thymic and post-thymic T-cell malignancies and has the advantages of being extremely rapid (a result is obtained within hours of the biopsy procedure), requiring no radiolabeling, using only a small amount of tissue, and being applicable to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to evaluate the effect of the synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) on angiogenesis in serum-free collagen gel culture of rat aorta. The GRGDS peptide contains the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), which has been implicated as a recognition site in interactions between extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and cell membrane receptors. RGD-containing synthetic peptides are known to inhibit attachment of endothelial cells to substrates, but their effect on angiogenesis has not been fully characterized. Aortic explants embedded in collagen gel in the absence of GRGDS generated branching microvessels through a process of endothelial migration and proliferation. Addition of GRGDS to the culture medium caused a marked inhibition of angiogenesis. In contrast, GRGES, a control peptide lacking the RGD sequence, failed to inhibit angiogenesis. The inhibitory effect of GRGDS was nontoxic and reversible. The angiogenic activity of aortic explants previously inhibited with GRGDS could be restored by incubating the cultures in GRGDS-free medium. These findings suggest that angiogenesis is an anchorage-dependent process that can be inhibited by interfering with the attachment of endothelial cells to the ECM. It also indicates that synthetic peptides can be used as probes to study the mechanisms by which the ECM regulates angiogenesis.\r"

In their analysis, Southern hybridization and DNA dot-blot analysis were used to screen 49 breast cancer DNAs for Myc, Neu, and Int-2 gene amplification. The analysis detected minimal one extra gene copy) as well as expanded (two or more extra gene copies) gene amplifications, and in addition, distinguished between gene amplification and aneuploidy as the cause of extra gene copies. These quantitative methods were adapted to patient specimens routinely available in the anatomic pathology laboratory, including fresh tumor tissue, tumor nuclei discarded during estrogen receptor analysis, and paraffin blocks. One minimal gene amplification was found in three cases of intraductal cancer. Of 25 cases of nonmetastatic invasive cancer, 28% had at least one extra Myc gene, whereas 24% had Neu, and 21% had Int-2 gene amplification. Of 21 cases of metastatic invasive cancer, 43% had Myc, 43% had Neu, and 40% had Int-2 gene amplification. Among the nonmetastatic cancers, 47% had one, 12% had two, and 4% had three amplified genes. Within the metastatic cancers, 48% had one, 28% had two, and 5% had three amplified genes. Our data suggest relationships between tumor progression and both incidence and size of Myc, Neu, and Int-2 gene amplification.\r"

In this model, the rat lung develops progressive alveolar edema with significant elevation of lavage fluid proteins at 2 to 8 hours of exposure. Ultrastructural changes in type II cells at 1 and 2 hours included enhanced lamellar body (LB) fusion with significant increase in the compound and vacuolated LB compartments. Parallel changes of lavage fluid surfactant membranes included a sustained, twofold increase in the proportion of loosely coiled multilamellar structures at 1 to 8 hours, with reciprocal decrease in the proportion of tubular myelin from control value of 56% to 34%. The proportion of densely coiled LB-like forms in lavage fluid increased significantly at 4 and 8 hours, whereas the proportions of unilamellar structures remained unchanged. The results indicate that ozone-induced alveolar injury initiates time-dependent defects in the organization of stored and secreted surfactant membranes. The acute ozone stress inhibits unfolding of secreted lamellar body membranes as well as their organization into tubular myelin, thereby perturbing the proportions of extracellular surfactant membranes that are available for adsorption onto the surface film.\r"

Because migration might provide an additional mode of cell redistribution and local mesangial hypercellularity in certain forms of glomerular disease, we examined, in vitro, the potential of isolated rat mesangial cells to migrate toward gradients of platelet releasate and selected platelet secretory proteins. Chemotaxis assays were performed in two compartment blind well chambers, each compartment separated by a porous membrane. Releasate of activated platelets was added in incremental concentrations (25, 50, and 100 micrograms/ml) to lower compartments, and mesangial cells were placed in upper compartments. The chambers were then incubated at 37 degrees C for 4 hours. Mesangial cell migration through the membranes was quantitated by scanning electron microscopy. Mesangial cells migrated toward platelet releasate in a linear dose-response, achieving cell numbers of approximately 40 times those of controls. Examination of specific platelet alpha granule secretory proteins disclosed a potent mesangial cell migratory response to platelet-released fibronectin (Fn), but not to transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), -beta (TGF-beta), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or platelet factor 4 (PF4). Secretory levels of platelet Fn (1 to 25 micrograms/ml) induced a maximum migratory response of approximately 60-fold over controls. Mesangial cell migration in response to both platelet Fn and platelet releasate was abrogated by blocking the integrin receptor for Fn with RGDS tetrapeptide. Thus, platelet Fn appears to be a prominent component of platelet releasate responsible for mesangial cell migration.\r"

The aim of this study was to characterize the Ki-67 antigen by means of immunobiochemical and molecular biology techniques. Enzymatic digestion experiments showed that this antigen is highly susceptible to protease treatment, and the antigen cannot be extracted by 0.1 normal HCl, indicating that Ki-67 antigen is a nonhistone protein. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with Ki-67 showed a double band with apparent molecular weights of 395 kd and 345 kd, regardless of whether the gels were run under reducing or nonreducing conditions. It is noteworthy that these bands were exclusively detectable in lysates prepared from proliferating cells, whereas they were absent in lysates obtained from quiescent cells. These immunobiochemical data are further substantiated by our molecular cloning approaches. By means of immunocloning with Ki-67, the authors isolated and sequenced several cDNA fragments from lambda gt11 libraries. A 1095-bp fragment gave a strong hybridization signal at 7.5 to 9.5 kb in Northern blot analysis with RNA prepared from proliferating cells, whereas it was negative with RNA prepared from quiescent cells. This cDNA fragment could be bacterially expressed, and in subsequent immunoblot analysis Ki-67 reacted exclusively with those fusion proteins that were derived from bacteria containing the insert in the right reading frame.\r"

The morphology of RFs embedded in Lowicryl K4M resin was well preserved after treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100. alpha B-crystallin immunoreactivity was present in RFs of various sizes and was the strongest in loosely scattered deposits, which were considered to be the initial stage of RFs. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in RFs was heavy, homogeneous throughout RFs, and equivalent to that in networks of glial filaments. Immunoreactivities of both alpha B-crystallin and GFAP were mainly restricted to the high electron-dense areas within RFs and were proved to exist close to each other by double immunolabeling. Rosenthal fibers were negative for vimentin. Ubiquitin immunoreactivity was relatively homogeneous in RFs with small diameters, but in RFs with large diameters, the immunoreactivity diminished in the center. Based on these observations, combined with the tendency of self-aggregation of alpha B-crystallin, it is conceivable that RFs are huge aggregation products of alpha B-crystallin involving GFAP, and that ubiquitination may be a consequent phenomenon, as it may be in other intracytoplasmic inclusions, such as neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies.\r"

Under conditions of low external Ca2+ (0.15 mmol/l [millimolar]), or high external Ca2+ (1.4 mmol/l), retinoic acid stimulated proliferation. Concomitantly, cell-substrate adhesion was decreased. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to assess production of two extracellular matrix components, ie, fibronectin and thrombospondin. In the presence of retinoic acid, production of both was decreased. Because both fibronectin and thrombospondin serve as epithelial cell adhesion factors, the decreased production of these moieties could contribute to reduced adhesion. Using 45Ca2+ to measure total cell-associated Ca2+ and the Ca2(+)-sensitive dye Indo-1 to measure intracellular free Ca2+, it was found that concentrations of retinoic acid that altered cell-substrate adhesion in the squamous epithelial cells had no effect on total, cell-associated Ca2+, but reduced intracellular free Ca2+ by 50% to 60%. Because Ca2+ is a regulator of adhesion, the ability of retinoic acid to modulate Ca2+ levels in the squamous epithelial cells may explain, in part, how retinoic acid influences their adhesiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Galanin is a neuropeptide that regulates the secretion of several pituitary hormones, including prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH). Galaninlike immunoreactivity (Gal-IR) and galanin mRNA in the rat anterior pituitary is cell lineage specific, with predominant expression in lactotrophs and somatotrophs. The authors examined the cellular distribution of human Gal-IR in seven normal postmortem pituitaries and 62 pituitary tumors by immunoperoxidase staining. In contrast to the rat, Gal-IR in human anterior pituitaries was present in corticotrophs scattered throughout the gland, but not in lactotrophs, somatotrophs, thyrotrophs, or gonadotrophs. Distinct Gal-IR also was present in hyperplastic and neoplastic corticotrophs in 19 of 22 patients with Cushing's disease. In noncorticotroph cell tumors, unequivocal Gal-IR was present in 5 of 11 GH-secreting tumors associated with clinical acromegaly, 9 of 18 nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, and 2 of 14 prolactinomas. Of these galanin-positive tumors, four of the five GH-secreting adenomas, six of the nine nonfunctioning adenomas, and both of the prolactinomas also contained adrenocorticotropic hormone immunoreactivity (ACTH-IR). Immunostaining and in situ hybridization on adjacent sections using an 35S-labeled probe complementary to human galanin mRNA demonstrated predominant galanin expression in normal corticotrophs. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the presence of Gal-IR in pituitary cells characteristic of corticotrophs in both normal and neoplastic pituitaries. Thus, as in the rat, galanin gene expression in the human pituitary is cell-type specific. Unlike the rat, however, human galanin gene expression is restricted to the corticotroph lineage. Studies of tumors confirmed the observed coexpression of galanin and adrenocorticotropic hormone. The divergent cell type specificity of galanin production in human and rat pituitaries reflects different patterns of gene activation in these two species. In addition, these results suggest that galanin in the human pituitary may participate locally in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\r"

The bound fraction of a crude pepsin extract of human placenta on JK-132 antibody-coupled resin showed close similarity to type IV collagen in a triple-helical conformation in terms of the amino acid composition and circular dichroism spectrum. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the fraction showed six peptide bands with molecular weights of 50,000 or below, both before and after reduction. Four of the peptides reacted with JK-132 on immunoelectroblotting, but none reacted with JK-199. JK-132 reacted with two additional bands with molecular weights of 100,000 and 120,000, which were not visible on direct staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Two peptides (molecular weights 40,000 and 15,000) bound on a JK-199 antibody affinity column were sequenced, and both contained the same amino-terminal sequences as alpha 1(IV) chain. Conversely the sequences of three of the peptides (molecular weights 50,000, 32,000, and 23,000) eluted from a JK-132 antibody affinity column did not match either the alpha 1(IV) or the alpha 2(IV) sequence reported. Immunohistochemically, JK-132 reacted strongly with basement membranes of blood capillaries in skeletal muscle tissues but not with the basement membranes of muscle fibers in frozen sections of periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue, suggesting heterogeneity or tissue specificity of basement membrane collagen. By immunoelectron microscopy, the reaction products were found on the basal laminae of endothelium and of smooth muscle cells around blood vessels. These findings suggest the presence of a new collagen chain associated with basal laminae.\r"

To determine if bone marrow cells are infected with SIV and if the pattern of viral infection is correlated with the severity of disease and abnormalities in hematopoiesis, 23 SIV-infected rhesus monkeys were examined by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. By immunohistochemistry, only four monkeys were positive for SIV core protein p27, while in situ hybridization revealed viral RNA in the bone marrow of 15 monkeys. Simian immunodeficiency virus RNA was consistently expressed in the bone marrow from monkeys with severe lymphoid depletion (11 of 11), but less so in monkeys with follicular hyperplasia (0 of 2) or mild lymphoid depletion (4 of 10). In animals with mild lymphoid depletion, bone marrow cells infected with SIV were mainly mononuclear cells that appeared to be of myelomonocytic lineage. In contrast, monkeys with severe lymphoid depletion had SIV RNA localized to larger mononuclear cells with abundant cytoplasm often located in small lucent areas of the stroma. These SIV RNA-positive mononuclear cells were positive for the macrophage determinant CD68 as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore the stage of simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome, as indicated by lymphoid morphology, and SIV localization in the bone marrow were correlated with the incidence of anemia, bone marrow hyperplasia, and abnormal distribution of macrophages in the bone marrow. These results indicate that, in common with other animal lentiviral infections, the macrophage is a major target of SIV infections in the bone marrow.\r"

The authors conclude that the induction of angiogenesis during nonspecific inflammation is associated with the early influx of myelomonocytic cells, but not with the infiltration of mature macrophages, T lymphocytes, or mast cells. This study shows that immunohistochemical analysis of cauterized murine corneas presents a useful tool for further studies on cells and cell products involved in the angiogenic process.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the functional alteration of human aortic endothelial cells with aging, prostacyclin synthesis was qualitatively and quantitatively examined. The endothelial cells of human aortas and umbilical veins or inferior vena cavae were immunohistochemically examined and found positive for prostacyclin, but the intensity of aortic endothelial cells from older subjects was low. In addition to the endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells in the thickened intima, not the media, of the aorta were also immunoreactive. Endothelial cells were successfully cultured from human aortas obtained from infants through aged subjects and were subdivided into three groups: young, middle, and old. Prostacyclin synthesis by endothelial cells from all types of blood vessels was extremely great at the primary culture, but decreased abruptly in the following subcultures. Among the aortic endothelial cells, the young group synthesized the largest amount of prostacyclin in a conventional culture condition, with synthesis progressively decreasing in the older groups. The in vitro prostacyclin biosynthesis was supported by the qualitative analysis on the tissue sections. These results indicate that prostacyclin synthesis of the aortic endothelial cells decreases with age, but intimal smooth muscle cells potentially have a back-up mechanism and substitute this synthesis to some extent. The decreased synthesis of prostacyclin with age may play an important role in the development and advancement of thrombosis and atherosclerosis.\r"

To determine which cells in the atherosclerotic plaque synthesize IL-1 in situ, the authors evaluated histologic sections of iliac arteries from cynomolgus monkeys using probes for IL-1 alpha and beta. A polyclonal antibody to IL-1 alpha and beta was used to determine if proteins were concomitantly produced. The predominant cells expressing IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA were foam cells in the intima. Adherent leukocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) expressed mRNA for IL-1 alpha. Microvascular endothelium expressed mRNA for both IL-1 alpha and beta. IL-1 proteins were located frequently in cells expressing IL-1 mRNA. These results indicate that endothelium and VSMCs, in conjunction with macrophages, serve as localized sources of IL-1 protein synthesis. These findings suggest that vascular cells may contribute directly to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular disease by actively secreting potent biologic mediators that modify vascular and immune cell function.\r"

  ".W": "The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is a group of cell surface glycoproteins involved in direct cell--cell adhesion. N-CAM expression in normal and neoplastic tissues was examined with specific antibodies and oligonucleotide probes by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Most neuroendocrine cells and tumors with secretory granules expressed N-CAM protein and mRNA. Parathyroid adenomas (4) were somewhat unusual, because N-CAM mRNA, but not protein, was detected in some of these benign neoplasms. Most non-neuroendocrine cells and tumors did not express N-CAM, although uterine smooth muscle and an adrenal cortical carcinoma were both positive. Western blots disclosed proteins of 180, 140, and 120 kd in normal adult brain, whereas two pheochromocytomas, a null cell adenoma, and a gastrinoma had proteins of approximately 180 and 140 kd. These results indicate that N-CAM protein and mRNA are widely expressed in neuroendocrine cells and neoplasms. N-CAM oligonucleotide probes as well as antibodies against N-CAM can be used as broad-spectrum neuroendocrine markers. In addition, these molecular probes can be used to examine the role of N-CAM in the development and regulation of neuroendocrine tissues.\r"

  ".U": "91189315\r", 
  ".W": "The capacity of human cultured mesangial cells to produce soluble factors potentially relevant for mechanisms of inflammation and immunity at the glomerular site was analyzed. The nature of the secreted factors initially was investigated by Northern blot analysis using total cellular RNAs isolated from resting and activated mesangial cells. On exposure of mesangial cells to human recombinant interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), high levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNAs were detected. Similar transcripts were found after stimulation with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Active secretion of IL-8 was documented by radioimmunoassay in supernatants of mesangial cells activated by either IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha. Using an in vitro migration assay, supernatants from resting mesangial cells were found to be devoid of any chemotactic activity for granulocytes or monocytes. On stimulation with IL-1 beta, however, mesangial cell supernatants expressed MCP-1 biologic activity detected as induction of a strong migratory response for human monocytes but not for granulocytes. In addition, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha induced high levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) mRNAs. Similarly IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha induced the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene and active secretion of its mature protein. These data strongly support an effector role for mesangial cells in modulating immune-inflammatory responses in glomeruli. Release of cytokines may activate not only infiltrating inflammatory cells through short paracrine pathways, but also mesangial cells themselves through an autocrine pathway.\r"

Sera from 69 of 81 ELISA-positive patients and from 56 ELISA-negative patients were then tested by Western analysis. As verified by strict Western immunoblot criteria, the overall HTLV-I seroprevalence was 2.2% (19/851). Age- and gender-specific prevalence data indicated an age-related acquisition of infection with no sexual predominance. No diagnosis category was over-represented among the seropositive patients. HTLV-I-specific antibodies were found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from one of six patients with spastic paraparesis. As in other Melanesian populations, the majority of ELISA-positive sera could not be confirmed by Western analysis. Reactivity to three or more gag-encoded proteins was found in 85% (45/53) of ELISA-positive, Western blot-indeterminate sera, and 30% (16/53) reacted to p19 and an env gene product but lacked reactivity to p24. Whether or not the high frequency of indeterminate HTLV-I Western immunoblots in the Solomon Islands is indicative of incomplete specific reactivity to HTLV-I or the existence of antigenically related retroviruses is being investigated.\r"

The CEC rabies vaccines had indexes of 10(5.1) and 10(6.0) in Habel tests, and have had potencies higher than those of the International Reference Vaccine II by National Institutes of Health (NIH) tests. Thirty healthy adults received 1 ml of the CEC rabies vaccines subcutaneously as primary immunization on days 0 and 7. Between six and 12 months after the primary immunization, 22 of the 30 subjects showed neutralizing antibody levels greater than or equal to 1:40 by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). The 30 subjects had been given booster immunizations of the CEC rabies vaccines at 8-14 months in addition to the primary immunization. Six to 12 months after the booster immunizations, 27 of the 30 subjects showed antibody levels greater than or equal to 1:40. No severe side reactions were reported during the course of vaccination. Thus we conclude that CEC rabies vaccine is effective and safe for pre-exposure immunization.\r"

Thirty days later, groups of rats were killed and serology, splenic culture, and histology were used to evaluate infection. Rats were successfully infected i.d. with 10(2-4) organisms or i.p. with 10(4-5) organisms. Neither three-day-old nor three-week-old rats were successfully infected o.n. with up to 10(6) organisms. For contact transmission, three-day-old or three-week-old inoculated rats were housed with unexposed littermates for 30 days. Inoculated rats became infected but contact rats remained free of infection. To study in utero transmission, five pregnant female Lewis rats were inoculated i.p. with 10(6) spirochetes at four days gestation. Although adult females seroconverted or had positive splenic cultures at 20 days gestation, the placentas and fetuses were uniformly culture-negative. Venereal transmission from seven infected females or six infected males to uninfected rats of the opposite sex was not demonstrated.\r"

The 89 kD component bound to the MAb was detected with biotinylated rabbit IgG antibody to O. viverrini metabolic products. As little as 0.05-0.1 ng of the antigen could be detected by this technique. A specific O. viverrini DNA probe constructed from a repetitive DNA segment containing 340 base pairs was used in a dot blot hybridization for the detection of parasite DNA. The labeled probe constructed as such could detect DNA released from as few as five O. viverrini eggs. Both methods were specific for O. viverrini and their sensitivity was comparable with that of the classical parasitological technic.\r"

One mangabey monkey and the chimpanzee became microfilaria-positive in skin snips at 16 and 21 months post-inoculation, respectively. Antibody activity to the 20 kDa antigen in the mangabey monkeys is noteworthy because of the prominence of this antigen among putatively immune persons living in onchocerciasis-endemic areas. The two mangabey monkeys responded parasitologically in a manner comparable to immune humans. No microfilariae were detected in one monkey and only scant numbers of microfilariae were observed in the second. The mangabey monkey may be a good animal model for the study of onchocerciasis.\r"

Age-stratified analysis of geometric mean antibody titers showed significant increases in antibody titers of all isotypes with age in the amicrofilaremic population. Antifilarial IgG1, 2, and 3 levels were higher in amicrofilaremic children than in microfilaremic children, significantly so for IgG2 and IgG3. In contrast, IgG4 antibody levels were higher in microfilaremic subjects than in amicrofilaremic subjects. A multivariate, unconditional, logistic regression model was developed from these data to predict infection status.

We then studied significant pathological differences between these groups in order to investigate the correlation between parasitized erythrocyte (PRBC) sequestration in small blood vessels in the brain, heart, lungs and small intestines. We found that the percentage of PRBC sequestration in the organs which we studied was higher in the CM patients than in the NCM patients. The difference of PRBC sequestration among the organs of two groups was significant (P less than 0.05). In the CM group, the average percentage of PRBC sequestration in the brain was significantly higher than in the heart, lungs and small intestines (P less than 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between PRBC sequestration in the brains, hearts, lungs and small intestines in the NCM group (P greater than 0.05). Our study indicates that severity of malaria in the CM patients depends on PRBC sequestration, especially in the brain. A combination of functional disturbances of the other organs, in addition to the cerebral pathology, may augment the severity of the disease.\r"

Parasitemia levels were slightly higher and time-to-death shorter in the nonimmunized pregnant group infected with virulent parasites relative to virgin controls. Subinoculation experiments revealed that numerous virulent organisms were present in the placentas of unprotected gravida but were absent from the fetal livers of their conceptuses. It was also found that mice preimmunized with irradiated P. yoelii survived a usually lethal challenge infection during mid-gestation and delivered healthy newborns. Associated with this protection against transplacental spread of parasites was the additional key finding that placental macrophages were as effective as peritoneal exudate cells in phagocytosing parasite derived material in vitro. This murine malaria-pregnancy model should provide new insights on the various factors (virulence, immunogenicity) of microbial infections affecting the fetal-maternal relationship, as well as on the expression of immune effector mechanisms and immunoregulation, during the reproductive process.\r"

  ".W": "An epidemiologic study of hyperendemic malaria in Arso PIR, a village in northeastern Irian Jaya (Indonesian New Guinea), revealed evidence suggesting suppression of gametocytemia independent of immune control of the asexual parasitemia. A total of 240 people, representing ages between 2 and 60 years, were followed by biweekly blood film examination for 16 weeks beginning in November 1987. Two distinct subpopulations were represented--1) life-long residents of Irian Jaya, and 2) transmigrants from Java who arrived in Irian Jaya 20 months before the surveillance effort began. Twenty-five percent of blood films from natives and 31% from Javanese were positive for falciparum malaria; of these, the rate of gametocytemia was 21% for natives, and 42% for the Javanese transmigrants (P less than 0.001). This difference could not be explained by differences in the frequency or grade of parasitemia, illness, or by known patterns of antimalarial consumption. Similarly, in Wor, a village near Arso PIR, the gametocyte rate for P. falciparum diminished from 83% to 25% in transmigrants from Java between their eleventh and twenty-fifth month of residence in Irian Jaya, a period during which the falciparum malaria rate remained stable between 30% and 50%. An immunofluorescent antibody test using whole, acetone-fixed gametocytes as substrate revealed correlation between antibody titer and protection from gametocytemia among the semi-immune natives of Arso PIR, but not among the Javanese. Specific immune suppression of gametocytes, independent of immune control of asexual parasites, can explain all of these observations.\r"

  ".W": "Investigators studied 348 children age 0-10 years, living in a holoendemic area of Liberia, for parasitological, serological and clinical parameters. The age-specific parasite rate increased towards the 7-10 year-old age group in which it was 86.8%. The geometrical mean parasite density decreased from the 3-4 year-old age group, in which fewer episodes of clinical malaria were observed. Antibodies to crude Plasmodium falciparum parasite antigens were detected in all children. The (EENV)6 seropositive rate was a maximum of 67.9% in the 3-11 month-old age group. It declined to a minimum of 31.7% in the 5-6 years age group after which it increased slowly in the 7-10 years age group. Antibodies to the synthetic peptide (NANP)6 showed a steady seropositive rate after the age of 3 months, between 30.0% and 39.3% in all the age groups up to 10 years. No statistically significant correlation was found between seropositivity to (EENV)6 and malarial parasitemia. In contrast, a statistically significant positive correlation was found between seropositivity to (NANP)6 and parasite rates. The antibody response for the individual child was transient to both Pf155/RESA, measured by immunofluorescence, and to (EENV)6 and (NANP)6, measured by ELISA, especially in the younger age groups of this study population. Parasitological and clinical immunity developed before a stable antibody response to these defined malaria antigens was established. These antibodies may still contribute to the immune protection against malaria, but they were not reliable parameters for protective immunity in the population we studied.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1986 and 1988, epidemiologic studies were carried out in a small rural community in an Andean region of Ecuador, where cutaneous leishmaniasis is highly endemic. A total of 25 human cases, positive for Leishmania parasites by culture and/or smear, were examined. Fourteen of the cases were in infants less than one year of age, suggesting intradomiciliary transmission of the disease. Clinically, many of these cases were similar to descriptions of \"uta,\" a form of cutaneous leishmaniasis which occurs in Andean regions of Peru and is reported caused by L. peruviana. Of the 11 positive cultures obtained from human cases in the present study, eight were identified by molecular characterization as L. mexicana and three were identified as L. major-like. Two additional isolates of L. mexicana were also made from an infected dog and from a sand fly, Lutzomyia ayacuchensis, living in the region, thus implicating the latter species as possible reservoir and vector, respectively, of L. mexicana in this highland community. The significance and validity of recent isolates of L. major-like parasites from the New World are also discussed.\r"

No pathological features providing clear differentiation of the CL and MCL strains were found. Although amastigotes were plentiful early in the development of primary forepaw lesions, they were either absent or could not be identified with certainty in sections of late stage lesions. Similarly, amastigotes were not found in histologic lesions at metastatic sites; however, leishmanial DNA was detected in both early and late stage forepaw lesions and metastatic lesions using Leishmania kinetoplast DNA and the gene coding for gp63 as hybridization probes. The DNA recovered from metastatic lesions was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues that had been stored at room temperature for prolonged periods.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal management of catheter-acquired bacteriuria after short-term catheter use in women. PATIENTS: Asymptomatic patients (119) with catheter-acquired bacteriuria were randomly assigned to receive no therapy, a single dose (320-1600 mg) of therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or 10 days (160-800 mg twice daily) of therapy. Thirty-two patients with lower tract symptoms alone received a single dose or 10 days of therapy, and 10 patients with upper tract symptoms or signs received 10 days of therapy. MAIN RESULTS: The mean and median durations of catheter use were 6 and 4 days, respectively. Bacteriuria resolved within 14 days without therapy in 15 of 42 (36%; 95% CI, 21% to 51%) asymptomatic patients. Seven of the remaining patients developed symptoms. Single-dose therapy resolved infection in 30 of 37 patients (81%; CI, 68% to 94%); 10 days of therapy resolved infection in 26 of 33 (79%; CI, 65% to 93%). For patients with lower tract symptoms alone, resolution rates with single-dose therapy or 10 days of therapy were similar (11 of 14 [79%] and 13 of 16 [81%], respectively). Ten days of therapy resolved infection in 6 of 9 (67%) patients with upper tract symptoms. Infection was resolved more often in women who were less than or equal to 65 years than in older women (62 of 70 [89%] versus 24 of 39 [62%]; P less than 0.001). Bacteriuria resolved spontaneously more frequently in younger (14 of 19 [74%] compared with 1 of 23 older women [4%]; P less than 0.001). Single-dose therapy resolved infection in 31 of 33 (94%) patients who were less than or equal to 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic bacteriuria after short-term catheter use frequently becomes symptomatic and should be treated. For asymptomatic patients and patients with lower tract symptoms alone, single-dose therapy was as effective as 10 days of therapy; it was very effective in women who were less than or equal to 65 years. Bacteriuria resolved spontaneously within 14 days after catheter removal more commonly in women who were less than or equal to 65 years and both types of therapy were less effective in older women.\r"

  ".W": "Sorbinil is a hydantoin aldose reductase inhibitor that has shown promise as therapy for patients with diabetic complications such as neuropathy and retinopathy. However, as many as 10% of patients receiving sorbinil have had adverse reactions characterized by fever, skin rash, and myalgia. Our previous studies of phenytoin suggested that susceptibility to reactions might result from an inherited detoxification defect. We did the current study to determine if sorbinil is metabolized to reactive intermediates and if cells from patients with a history of a reaction to sorbinil are appropriate for the in-vitro investigation of susceptibility. Microsome-generated metabolites of sorbinil (50 microM) were toxic to normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (7.9% +/- 0.3% dead cells [mean +/- SE]). Toxicity was increased in the presence of an epoxide hydrolase inhibitor (17.5% +/- 0.3% dead cells) and abolished by an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450. In contrast to cells from healthy controls and diabetics who tolerated sorbinil (7.9% +/- 0.7% and 7.8% +/- 0.4% dead cells, respectively), cells from the six patients who had sorbinil reactions showed significantly increased toxicity from metabolites of sorbinil and phenytoin (19.7% +/- 2.3% dead cells, P less than 0.001). Cells from three patients who had reactions to phenytoin were similarly sensitive to sorbinil metabolites (23.4% +/- 0.3% dead cells). We conclude that sorbinil is oxidatively metabolized to a potentially toxic intermediate. Certain patients may be at increased risk for developing hypersensitivity reactions. Development of this important new drug has been hampered by uncommon but potentially severe reactions. An increased understanding of the steps involved in the development of adverse reactions could lead to screening tests or to the development of safer compounds.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized time series. SETTING: Outpatient clinic at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Eleven consecutive patients with biopsy-proven membranous glomerulonephritis and rising plasma creatinine levels over at least 6 months. INTERVENTION: Cyclophosphamide and prednisone in ten patients and cyclophosphamide alone in one patient. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In ten patients treated with both agents, the median plasma creatinine rose 53 mumol/L (0.6 mg/dL) over the months before treatment from 141 to 194 mumol/L (1.6 to 2.2 mg/dL) (95% CI, 27 to 141 mumol/L; P = 0.002). After combined therapy for 6 months, the median plasma creatinine fell to 133 mumol/L (1.5 mg/dL) for a median decline of 62 mumol/L (0.7 mg/dL) (CI, 44 to 150 mumol/L; P = 0.006). Pretreatment plasma creatinine levels, which ranged from 159 to 371 mumol/L (1.8 to 4.2 mg/dL), decreased in the ten patients by 6 months and remained stable in seven of the eight patients followed 24 to 54 months after therapy was completed. The median urine protein excretion decreased by 9.6 g/d with 12 months of therapy in the ten patients from 11.9 to 2.3 g/d (CI, 6.0 to 15.1 g/d; P less than 0.001). The median plasma albumin rose by 14 g/L from 24 to 38 g/L (CI, 11 to 19 g/L; P less than 0.001). The median plasma cholesterol fell by 3.26 mumol/L (140 mg/dL) from 10.45 to 6.52 mumol/L (405 to 252 mg/dL) (CI, 1.42 to 7.16 mumol/L; P = 0.01). One patient who had a relapse 30 months after completing therapy responded to re-treatment with renal function and nephrotic variables returning toward normal. The eleventh patient received cyclophosphamide alone and had a course similar to that of the combined therapy group. CONCLUSION: Cyclophosphamide plus prednisone can promote prolonged remissions in membranous glomerulonephritis even when renal function is already declining.\r"

DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: United States Army hospital in Egypt. PARTICIPANTS: United States military personnel with travelers' diarrhea (n = 104) during a military exercise in November 1989. Persons who were noncompliant, had bloody diarrhea, or had received antidiarrheal medications before entry into the study were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: All participants with travelers' diarrhea were treated with ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice daily for 3 days. Fifty of these patients were randomly assigned to receive loperamide, a 4-mg first dose and 2 mg for every loose stool (as much as 16 mg/d), and 54 were randomly assigned to receive placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was isolated from 57% of patients; Shigella and Salmonella, seen in 4% and 2% of patients, respectively, were not common. MAIN RESULTS: After 24 hours, the symptoms of 82% of patients in the ciprofloxacin and loperamide group compared with 67% in the ciprofloxacin and placebo group had improved or fully recovered (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.8 to 6.3; P = 0.08). After 48 hours, the symptoms of 90% of both groups had improved or fully recovered. The mean number of stools for those receiving loperamide was not much lower than those who did not receive loperamide after 24 hours (1.9 +/- 0.2 [SE] compared with 2.6 +/- 0.2) or 48 hours (3.1 +/- 0.3 compared with 4.0 +/- 0.3) of treatment (P = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: In a region where enterotoxigenic E. coli was the predominant cause of travelers' diarrhea, loperamide combined with ciprofloxacin was not better than treatment with ciprofloxacin alone. Loperamide appeared to have some benefit in the first 24 hours of treatment in patients infected with enterotoxigenic E. coli. Both regimens were safe.\r"

SETTING: Tennessee Medicaid program. PARTICIPANTS: The case patients (n = 1415) were hospitalized between 1984 and 1986 for gastric or duodenal ulcer or for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage of unknown cause. The controls (n = 7063) were randomly selected from Medicaid enrollees not meeting the study criteria for inclusion as case patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The estimated relative risk for the development of peptic ulcer disease among current users of oral corticosteroids was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.0). However, the risk was increased only in those who concurrently received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); these persons had an estimated relative risk associated with current corticosteroid use of 4.4 (CI, 2.0 to 9.7). In contrast, the estimated relative risk for those corticosteroid users not receiving NSAIDs was 1.1 (CI, 0.5 to 2.1). Persons concurrently receiving corticosteroids and NSAIDs had a risk for peptic ulcer disease that was 15 times greater than that of nonusers of either drug. CONCLUSION: Discrepant findings among earlier studies regarding steroids and the risk for peptic ulcer disease could in part be due to differences in the use of NSAIDs among study participants. The high risk for peptic ulcer disease associated with combined use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids indicates the need to prescribe this drug combination cautiously.\r"

PARTICIPANTS: From November 1989 to January 1990, 154 adults were screened. MEASUREMENTS: Split venous samples from fasting participants were analyzed for total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol with screening and standardized laboratory methods. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels were calculated using the Friedewald equation. Split venous samples from nonfasting participants were analyzed for total cholesterol. Capillary blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol with the screening method. MAIN RESULTS: Total cholesterol measurements in screening venous blood samples were 5.4% and 3.8% lower than the laboratory values in samples from fasting and nonfasting participants, respectively. Triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol values in venous samples obtained from fasting participants were, on average, 9.8% and 11.2% lower than the respective laboratory measurements. Screening HDL-cholesterol values varied, differing from the laboratory values by as much as 40% in 95% of participants. In fasting participants, total cholesterol in capillary samples averaged 5.5% higher than in venous samples; in nonfasting participants the capillary samples were 3.1% higher. Screening for either total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol identified 93% of the persons with LDL-cholesterol values of 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) or higher. CONCLUSIONS: Total cholesterol can be reliably measured in samples from fasting or nonfasting persons. The values in capillary blood samples were slightly higher than those in venous samples. Screening HDL-cholesterol values were too variable to establish the HDL-cholesterol level reliably. Participants with high LDL-cholesterol levels were identified as accurately by measuring total cholesterol only when compared with calculating the LDL-cholesterol level from total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations.\r"

Toxicity was produced in 27 of 40 patients by inpatient or emergency department theophylline administration. Management errors found included delay (greater than 10 hours) in taking action from time toxic blood levels were drawn (20 patients), inappropriately high dosing of patients with congestive heart failure (17 patients), failure to recognize obvious symptoms (16 patients), recurrent toxicity (11 patients), additional emergency department treatment of already toxic patients (7 patients), overlap of intravenous and oral therapy (6 patients), patient discharged with no physician awareness of toxicity or dosage change (5 patients). CONCLUSIONS: A set of recurring management errors was identified as contributing to inpatient theophylline toxicity. Effective preventive mechanisms could have prevented most toxicity and associated morbidity. Theophylline's overall risk-benefit ratio in the inpatient setting may be less than that measured in well-controlled studies of the drug's efficacy because of these management errors.\r"

  ".W": "Clinicians increasingly are urged to integrate preventive services into their clinical practices. To facilitate this process, several groups have developed practice guidelines for preventing disease in asymptomatic patients. In this paper, we compare and contrast preventive guidelines from the American College of Physicians (ACP), the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (CTF), the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and other well-known authorities. We chose these groups because they based their recommendations on explicit methods that include critical appraisal of the pertinent literature. Recommendations from these authorities usually are consistent with each other. Moreover, the ACP, CTF, and USPSTF all favor a shift away from the relatively simple classification of patients by age and sex for general preventive interventions to the more complex stratification of patients by additional risk factors and the formulation of a selective prevention strategy that is specific to each risk profile. Some guidelines, particularly the criteria used to define patients who are at increased risk for preventable disease and who should have more intensive surveillance, are difficult to interpret. Further research is needed to address some areas of disagreement and ambiguity. In addition, new tools must be developed to help physicians apply preventive guidelines, particularly those that require noting many patient-specific characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular arrhythmias remain the leading cause of death from coronary artery disease. This review summarizes current thinking in several areas relating to the pathophysiology, prognosis, and therapy of ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute and chronic coronary artery disease syndromes. The experimental basis of arrhythmias in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia and chronic myocardial infarction is described, stressing the important pathophysiologic differences between these two conditions. The effects of the autonomic nervous system as a key modulator of ischemic arrhythmogenesis are discussed. Insights, derived from endocardial mapping studies, into the nature of ventricular tachycardia in humans with chronic myocardial infarction are described, including implications for risk stratification and therapy to prevent arrhythmia recurrence. Current therapeutic principles are discussed in the management of ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery disease, including pharmacologic approaches, surgical and catheter ablation, and automatic implantable cardioverting and defibrillating devices.\r"
