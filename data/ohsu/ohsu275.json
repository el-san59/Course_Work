They were seen on 2 consecutive years on 4267 occasions; a total of 21,905 solar keratoses were present on the first visit. A squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) developed within 12 months on 28 of the 4267 occasions. Where accurate mapping of both SCCs and pre-existing solar keratoses was available, it was found that 10/17 (60%) SCCs arose from a lesion diagnosed clinically as a solar keratosis in the previous year and the other 7 (40%) SCCs on what had been clinically normal skin 12 months previously. The risk of malignant transformation of a solar keratosis to SCC within 1 year was less than 1/1000. The cost-effectiveness of treating all solar keratoses to prevent the development of SCC is questionable.\r"

Increments from baseline in the first half of pregnancy were considered as well as absolute levels. A combination of a high maximum diastolic pressure with a large increase from baseline was better for identifying a group with pre-eclamptic features than either measurement on its own. A first diastolic pressure below 90 mm Hg, a subsequent increase of at least 25 mm Hg, and a maximum reading of at least 90 mm Hg gave appropriate criteria. These were applied to a second set of 15,624 singleton pregnancies and successfully identified a group with pre-eclamptic features. Fewer women were identified as pre-eclamptic than with criteria modified from an existing definition widely used in Britain. The women excluded by the new criteria had the features of mild chronic hypertension rather than pre-eclampsia. The new definition is simple to use but like all other definitions of pre-eclampsia cannot be precise.\r"

Women with a history of being abused were significantly more likely to have raised scores on both measures of psychopathology and to be identified as psychiatric cases. 20% of women who had been exposed to sexual abuse as a child were identified as having psychiatric disorders, predominantly depressive in type, compared with 6.3% of the non-abused population. Similar increases in psychopathology were found in women who had been physically or sexually assaulted in adult life. These findings indicate that the deleterious effects of abuse can continue to contribute to psychiatric morbidity for many years.\r"

Comparison of diagnoses based on the clinical findings with the correct diagnoses supported by investigations showed that 28% of physicians' diagnoses were incorrect. The more often the examiners differed from the majority on the presence or absence of a sign, the more likely they were to make an incorrect diagnosis. A ranked order of the reliability with which chest signs are elicited would improve the teaching of chest medicine.\r"

Infection can lead to erosion into a major vessel, such as the carotid artery or a smaller peripheral tonsil vessel. Whereas fatal erosion into a major vessel from a deep neck abscess was relatively common in the past, it is rare since the advent of antibiotics. Spontaneous tonsillar hemorrhage, when it does occur, appears to occur most commonly in a peripheral tonsil vessel from bacterial tonsillitis. Medical records of 860 patients with conditions considered to be susceptible to STH were reviewed. Ten cases of STH were identified. All were from peripheral tonsil vessel hemorrhage; none was secondary to major vessel erosion. Bacterial tonsillitis was the most common cause of STH and occurred in 8 of 10 cases. This condition accounted for an incidence of STH in tonsillitis of 1.1%. A history of chronic tonsillitis appeared to predispose a patient to STH. Other causes of STH were infectious mononucleosis and neoplasm. Seven of the ten peripheral STHs presented with bleeding from an obvious venous source. The other three patients had significant hemorrhages which led to arteriography. Arteriograms are indicated in patients with clinical features suggesting possible major vessel erosion or in those patients where significant bleeding is not from an obvious peripheral source. A peripheral STH can be successfully managed with local intervention and tonsillectomy.\r"

We recently reported that the mitochondrial dye, Rhodamine-123 (Rh-123), at nontoxic doses, is an effective sensitizing agent for argon laser treatment of human squamous carcinoma and melanoma cells in vitro. We now report the complete inhibition of in vivo tumor development by human M24 melanoma cells transplanted subcutaneously into nu/nu mice after exposure to 1 microgram/ml of Rh-123 for 1 hour and treatment with an argon laser at nonthermal temperatures of 36 to 40 degrees C. Significant in vivo growth was observed for all control tumors. These results demonstrate that Rh-123 enhances the tumoricidal effects of the argon laser at nonthermal temperatures and provides evidence that effective photodynamic therapy may be possible in vivo with the new fluorochrome Rhodamine-123.\r"

The ideal method for preventing rupture of an exposed artery should be easy to perform, safe, effective and should spare local and regional flaps for later use in reconstruction. Isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Bucrylate) is a commercially available compound that appears to meet these criteria. Test animals were divided into two groups. The carotid arteries of 12 dogs (group A) were exteriorized bilaterally and coated with Bucrylate unilaterally. Group B (four dogs) underwent the same procedure except that the vessels were bilaterally coated. Wounds were dressed twice daily with moist-to-dry gauze. No antibiotics were given. Nine of the 12 unprotected arteries in group A ruptured within 2 weeks, and one unprotected artery ruptured on postoperative day (POD) 29. Two dogs healed over both vessels. In group B, three dogs ruptured their arteries within 2 weeks. One dog healed over both vessels. Gross and histologic examination of the arteries showed a striking difference between coated and uncoated vessels. We believe that Bucrylate and cyanoacrylate adhesives hold promise in the clinical protection of exposed carotid arteries.\r"

Unilateral high frequency hearing loss was found in three patients but persisted in only one of them. Abnormal ABR tracings occurred in four patients but reversed to normal in one of them. The study suggests a trend toward increased incidence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and ABR changes as frequency and severity of crisis episodes increases. The relationship between SNHL and ABR is analyzed and discussed.\r"

There are distinct groups of ossicular anomalies, in each of which patients show similar degrees of hearing loss and ossicular findings. These include spindle handle, malleus bar, and dislocated annulus. Spindle handle gets its name from the shape of the malleus handle. There is disconnection between the long process of the incus and the capitulum of the stapes. Malleus bar is a kind of malleus fixation, in which a small bony bar connects the tip of the malleus handle to the posterior wall of the tympanic cavity. In the dislocated annulus, the annulus is dislocated cranially in relation to the middle-ear structures. Anomalies of the ossicle are usually present. Surgical repairs for these conditions are discussed.\r"

EMG signals from bilateral homologous facial muscle sites were converted into computer-compatible waveform traces and displayed on a video monitor. This facilitated modification of neuromuscular responses using behavioral shaping techniques. A six-point Facial Nerve Grading Scale was introduced for hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis to assess the results of EMG rehabilitation. Rehabilitation lasted from 3 to 18 months. Ten patients (33%) achieved the highest possible grading (II) with symmetry and synchrony of function and spontaneity of expression; 17 (57%) reached grade III, which allowed voluntary control of eye and mouth function; 3 (10%) showed minimal gains. It is suggested that neural plasticity allows therapeutic manipulation of central facilitory and inhibitory mechanisms, and possible unmasking of neural connections between the ipsilateral VII and XII nerve motor nuclei which leads to improved facial function.\r"

Six patients had type II, in which osteosclerosis is most pronounced at the base of the skull. All investigated patients except one had otoneurological manifestations, but only two of of the 14 had otoneurological complaints. Symptoms were related to radiological types. Involvement of the trigeminal nerve was seen only in type I, whereas involvement of the facial nerve was found primarily in type II. Conductive hearing loss was particularly common in type I, and may reflect a high frequency of otosclerosis. Tomography of the petrous bones showed a significant narrowing of the internal acoustic meatus in type I (p less than 0.01) when compared to normal controls, but no significant narrowing in type II.\r"

Radiopaque markers of 4 mm diameter were affixed to the pharyngeal wall by suction. Ventrodorsal and axial components of motion were measured frame by frame. Large axial motions occurred during the pharyngeal stage of swallowing. Cephalad displacement of each marker occurred early and was followed by caudad motion. Within the pharyngoesophageal segment, there were cephalocaudal motions measuring as much as 25 mm. A late caudad motion beyond the reference position was observed in this segment in two participants. This late motion may play a role in passing the bolus through the pharyngoesophageal segment. The findings support the concept of an \"engulfment\" mechanism in pharyngeal kinesiology.\r"

Most causes of pediatric upper airway obstruction are well recognized, often discussed in the literature, and commonly encountered in practice. However, ectopic thyroid (i.e., thyroid tissue found in places other than its normal location) may be an unusual cause of pediatric upper airway obstruction with which the clinician may not be familiar. The resulting airway obstruction may be slow or rapid in onset, total or partial, and the relationship of the thyroid to the airway may be clear or obscure. Two cases of obstructing ectopic thyroid are presented which demonstrate the spectrum within which this form of airway obstruction may occur. One case is the first reported example in the English literature of pediatric intratracheal thyroid. A review of the literature is also presented. Four types of ectopic thyroid (lingual, sublingual, thyroglossal, and intralaryngotracheal) are illustrated and discussed in relation to their effect upon the pediatric upper airway. The authors also review the developmental anatomy of the thyroid and present two major theories regarding the development of intralaryngotracheal thyroid. The possible etiologies of the other ectopic forms are also discussed.\r"

It has been speculated that vocal pathology in this population is the result of laryngeal compensation for abnormal velopharyngeal valving. This paper describes the prevalence of laryngeal/voice findings in a group of 85 patients referred for multimethod evaluation of velopharyngeal dysfunction. Forty-one percent of the patients had auditorily perceived voice symptoms and/or observable laryngeal abnormalities. Twenty-one percent of the patients had vocal fold nodules or thickened vocal folds. There was no clear relationship between laryngeal/voice findings and nasoendoscopic or aerodynamic assessments of velopharyngeal dysfunction. However, there was a significant relationship between laryngeal/voice findings and estimated subglottal pressure. Patients with laryngeal/voice findings (with or without nodules) had average estimated subglottal pressure values which were outside the normal range more often than patients without laryngeal/voice findings. These results suggest patients referred for assessment of velopharyngeal dysfunction should receive a comprehensive evaluation which includes screening laryngeal structure and function.\r"

Control animals inoculated with inactivated CMV showed no hearing loss, viral infection, or endolymphatic hydrops. Seropositive animals showed complete protection from hearing loss and viral infection, yet a monocytic infiltrate was seen surrounding the endolymphatic sac. Associated with this localized immune response was mild evidence of endolymphatic hydrops in 40% (2/5) of the animals. Control seropositive animals inoculated with inactivated CMV showed no hearing loss or morphological changes. CMV then, can infect cells of the endolymphatic sac resulting in hearing loss and endolymphatic hydrops. The immune response to CMV in seropositive animals is protective, but is associated with endolymphatic sac inflammation.\r"

For these complex problems, all but one patient required multiple-stage surgery to obtain their final aesthetic and functional results. All flaps proved reliable and versatile. Their advantages include proximity to the reconstructive site, ease of bilateral reconstructions, and well-camouflaged donor deficit. In particular, the ability to transfer vascularized full-thickness cranial bone for total or bilateral mandibular reconstructions presents an additional possibility for this difficult problem. We conclude that the reconstructive potential of these flaps is limited only by the surgeon's ingenuity.\r"

The technique employs laser-induced spectroscopic signals, collected and transmitted via an array of optical fibers, to produce discrete pixels of information from which a map or image of a desired tissue characteristic is constructed. We describe a prototype LSI catheter that produces spectral images of the interior of human arteries for diagnosis of atherosclerosis. The diagnostic is based on the fact that normal artery wall and atherosclerotic plaque exhibit distinct fluorescence spectra in the 500-650 nm range when excited by 476-nm laser light; the fluorescence from blood is minimal. The catheter is composed of 19 optical fibers enclosed in a transparent, protective shield. Argon ion laser radiation is used for excitation, and an optical multichannel spectral analyzer is used for detection. Sequential sampling is used to minimize crosstalk among fibers and reduce blurring of the image. Computer-processed 19-pixel spectroscopic images are produced of fresh cadaver artery in vitro. Regions of normal tissue, plaque, and blood are identified, and the diagnoses are confirmed histologically and by direct spatial correlation. The results demonstrate the concept of using this laser catheter system for real-time imaging.\r"

Optimal activation was produced by argon dye laser at 0.5 W and a total energy dose of 300 J/cm2 at 620 nm and 650 nm, irradiated through blood with a hematocrit of 8%. Activation was evidenced by reduction of optical density by 0.3 units at 340 nm caused by oxidation of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in a buffered reaction solution containing 0.1 mg/ml of phycocyanin. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by measuring viability of mouse myeloma cells in culture after incubation with phycocyanin (0.25 mg/ml) and irradiated by 300 J/cm2 at 514 nm. After 72 hours post-treatment the cells showed 15% viability compared to 69% and 71% for control cells exposed to laser only or phycocyanin only, respectively. Atherosclerotic artery segments obtained within 5 hours postmortem were perfused with 0.1 mg/ml phycocyanin in oxygenated Krebs Ringer solution at 30 mm Hg for 5 minutes followed by washout with phycocyanin-free Krebs for 10 minutes. Artery sections examined histologically by light and fluorescence microscopy showed specific fluorescence localization within the plaque particularly at the elastic laminae and to a larger extent at the internal elastic lamina but not in the medial muscle layer. In conclusion, phycocyanin is a cytotoxic photosensitizer that exhibits specific binding to plaque and is activated at a wavelength minimally absorbed by blood. These properties suggest potential therapeutic use for plaque localization and regression.\r"

For all tissues examined, the ablation threshold energy increased with increasing pulse duration, but the threshold for normal tissue ablation was approximately twice that of plaque at all pulse durations. Ablation efficiency was studied at a fluence that was twice the ablation threshold for plaque. For those fluences, normal intima had detectable ablation only at 50 microseconds. The ablation efficiency of fibrofatty plaque was minimally reduced with prolongation of pulse duration; however, there was a substantial decrease in the ablation efficiency of calcified plaque when the pulse duration was lengthened from 8 to 50 microseconds. These data show significant selective ablation of fibrofatty and calcified plaque at 1, 8, and 50 microseconds and suggest that the optimal pulse width for selective ablation of all plaque in the 480- to 490-waveband is less than 50 microseconds.\r"

  ".W": "Dehiscence of portions of atheromatous plaques fractured during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty may contribute to both abrupt reclosure and gradual restenosis. Laser balloon angioplasty has been shown to be effective in welding human plaque-arterial wall separations in vitro by heating tissues with a Nd:YAG laser during balloon inflation. To define the potentially useful therapeutic range of tissue temperature required to achieve thermal welds, 220 1-cm diameter discs of human postmortem atheromatous aortic tissue, the intimal plaque of which had been separated from the media, were exposed to 3-25 watts of Nd:YAG laser radiation delivered over a 12-mm2 nominal spot size for 20 seconds via a 400-micron core optical fiber. As measured with a thermistor, adventitial temperature reflected the temperature at the plaque-media junction to within 10 degrees C. The degree of tissue temperature elevation was related to delivered energy, while effective tissue penetration increased to maximum depth of 3 mm at the highest power density. Strength of tissue welds was defined as the force required to shear opposing layers of welded segments. Adventitial tissue temperatures below 80 degrees C were not associated with appreciable welds, while equilibrium temperatures between 95 degrees C and 140 degrees C were consistently associated with effective mean weld strengths, which increased linearly from 25 to 110 g, respectively. Temperatures greater than 150 degrees C were associated with rapid tissue dehydration and charring. These data suggest that the therapeutic range of tissue temperature that provides effective thermal fusion of intima-media separations is broad and that the depth and degree of thermal coagulation can be controlled by manipulation of laser energy delivery.\r"

Although Nd:YAG laser energy has been shown to be effective in the thermal fusion of plaque-arterial wall separations in vitro, the most efficient manner of energy delivery for rapid achievement of therapeutically useful equilibrium tissue temperature during laser exposure has not been defined. A comparison of weld strength achieved was therefore made between two formats of laser delivery: constant power vs. decremental power with an initial high dose followed by the minimal serial decrements necessary to maintain tissue temperature constant for 15 seconds. One hundred sixty-six tissue discs of human postmortem aorta of 11 mm diameter were studied. Intimal plaque was separated from the media, the two layers were juxtaposed, a force of 4 pounds was applied, and a fiberoptic-delivered laser beam was directed perpendicular to the tissue over a 3-mm-diameter nominal spot size. Weld strength was measured as the shear force required to separate completely the two tissue layers. The mean weld strength (75 g) achieved by use of the decremental power format was significantly higher (P less than .01) than the mean strength (32 g and 56 g) achieved by using constant power for 20 and 30 seconds, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Effective cutting occurred at lower energy fluences in the ultraviolet than in the visible or infrared. For 308 nanometers, at any energy density, number of pulses to perforation was relatively independent of power density. Therefore, long-pulse ultraviolet wavelengths which could be transmitted through fiberoptics were identified as well suited for a clinical, submicrosecond pulsed laser angioplasty system.\r"

Exposure conditions were controlled by using an optically shielded laser catheter that provided a 500 micron spot of light of known power. Two thresholds for consistently reproducible ablation could be defined-an intensity threshold at 25.5 W/mm2 and a fluence threshold at 3.2 J/mm2. Above threshold, a fluence of 5.1 J/mm2 was found to produce the most efficient ablation, ie, removed the greatest volume (mm3) per energy delivered (J) compared to other fluence levels employed (p less than 0.0001). Between aortic segments, however, considerable variability in efficiency (mm3/J) was observed, possibly owing to different optical properties and/or plaque composition. Low-intensity laser radiation produced inconsistent ablation and extensive coagulation effects to surrounding tissue. When a fluence of 5.1 J/mm2 was constructed with a high-intensity laser beam and a short exposure time, consistent and efficient tissue removal resulted without histologic evidence of coagulation necrosis.\r"

We found that total volume of gas produced is small not only at equilibrium (0.3 +/- 0.1 microliter/J when firing in blood alone and also when ablating aorta in blood or saline media) but also at peak (2.5 +/- 0.2 microliters/J firing in blood alone and 1.0 +/- 0.1 microliter/J or 0.9 +/- 0.1 microliter/J when ablating aorta in saline or blood, respectively). Because these volumes are small, a clinically significant event from a gas embolus is unlikely during intravascular laser ablation of atheromatous plaque in the energy and power range studied. No gas was quantitated when firing the argon ion laser into 0.9% saline solution alone. The peak gas volume when firing in blood alone was significantly greater than that produced in the other chamber environments. This is thought to be due to increased absorption of argon laser light by hemoglobin. The gas volumes produced by lasing aorta in 0.9% saline or blood were not statistically different.\r"

This study compared the acute tissue response and long-term healing of sutured and laser-welded anastomoses of vein segments used to bypass ligated canine femoral arteries. For each procedure, one anastomosis was formed using running 6-0 polypropylene suture (control), and the other anastomosis was formed using argon laser tissue welding (experimental). The vein grafts were harvested at 4 (n = 2), 8 (n = 1), 12 (n = 1), and 16 (n = 2) weeks, and selected samples were evaluated by histologic examination, electron microscopy, tensile strength testing, and by measuring the formation of [3H]hydroxyproline as an index of collagen synthesis. Examination of successful laser fusions immediately after they were formed showed bonding of collagen to collagen and elastin to collagen. Follow-up evaluations showed that the precision of tissue apposition affected the rate of healing and tensile strength. Laser-welded anastomoses demonstrated a progression of healing similar to sutured repairs, with remodeling of fibrous tissue and collagen being the primary component of weld integrity. This study demonstrates that sutured and argon laser-welded vein-artery anastomoses heal comparably up to 16 weeks postoperatively, and that laser welding is a satisfactory alternative to sutured anastomoses.\r"

  ".W": "A Nd-YAG laser (1064 nm) coupled to a silica fiber (0.6 mm core diameter) was used to create defects in a model of arterial vascular obstruction. We employed transparent agar doped with black ink as atheromatous material and studied the size and shape of defects created by various lasing parameter settings. By adding calcium sulphate to the agar its scattering properties were enhanced. The created defects correspond to a temperature boundary. The optical properties of the agar greatly influenced the size and shape of the created defects. In the agar with enhanced scattering properties, the created defects showed an unfavourable penetration width-depth ratio. Maximum width of penetration always exceeded the fiber diameter. This may contribute to an increased risk of vessel wall perforation in small vessels and, if the fiber is positioned close to the vessel wall, even when a coaxial position is maintained. With increasing cumulative energy, both maximum depth and width of penetration leveled off in both agars. The results suggest that agar can be used to obtain empirically the lasing parameters that will minimize the risk of vessel wall perforation by an axially positioned fiber. The agar model needs further study to determine its limitations, but agar seems to be a useful substitute for atheroma in the study of laser catheter angioplasty.\r"

Unlike most other paraneoplastic syndromes, the course is often remitting and relapsing. Neuropathological examination in 3 of our patients showed lymphocytic cuffing of occasional blood vessels throughout the central nervous system, associated with a mild, diffuse proliferation of microglia in 1 patient. Apart from a mild, patchy loss of Purkinje cells in 1 patient, there was no loss of neurons from the cerebellum, brainstem, cerebral hemispheres, or spinal cord. These patients differ from those with the more common paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration by the predominance of truncal over limb ataxia, the presence of myoclonus, the absence of severe dysarthria, a tendency for remission, and the preservation of Purkinje cells.\r"

Fifty-five percent were females and 45%, males. The left kidney was affected in 47% of cases, the right kidney in 40%, both in 4%, and a transplanted pelvic kidney in 9%. Fever (55%), chills or diaphoresis (47%), flank pain (40%), abdominal pain (40%), and nausea or vomiting (32%) were the most common presenting symptoms. About half the patients had symptoms for 1 week or less and 12% had no symptoms. Fever was documented before diagnosis in 88% of patients. Abdominal mass (13%) or tenderness (49%), and flank mass (9%) or tenderness (42%) were seen less frequently, and 11% of patients did not have fever, flank, or abdominal findings. The most frequent underlying conditions included previous urologic surgery (45%), previous urinary tract infection (38%), diabetes mellitus (36%), and urinary tract stones (36%). Cultures of perinephric abscesses yielded gram-negative aerobes in 52% of patients, primarily Escherichia coli. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 26% of patients and anaerobes in 17%. A single pathogen was isolated in 71% and multiple isolates in 29%. Of interest and great potential therapeutic importance was culture of anaerobes, primarily Bacteroides spp. in 17%, Enterococcus spp. in 7%, and Candida albicans in 7%. Positive blood and urine cultures identified perinephric abscess organisms exactly in 58% and 37% of cases, respectively. Routine laboratory tests such as the white blood cell count and urinalysis were insensitive and non-specific for perinephric abscess. Leukocytosis and anemia at admission were seen in slightly more than half of the patients. For radiologic diagnosis, computerized tomographic scanning was most helpful. Ultrasound and intravenous pyelography were falsely negative in about one-third of cases. Mortality (13%) was low in this series when compared with earlier studies, and probably reflects modern medical care. Six patients (13%) died during hospitalization, 2 of whom had diagnosis of PNA established only at autopsy. Drainage of the perinephric abscess was carried out by open surgical drainage in 64% of patients, percutaneous drainage in 19%, and both in 13%. The initial procedure, whether open surgical drainage or percutaneous catheter drainage, was usually successful. Late complications included nephrocutaneous fistulas in 3 patients and disseminated candidiasis in 1 patient.\r"

We described 9 patients with infection caused by Fusarium species during a 4-year period at the M. D. Anderson Hospital. The spectrum of infections included disseminated disease in 4 patients, skin or soft-tissue infections in 3, pneumonia in 1, and fungemia in 1. All 4 patients with disseminated infection had culture- and biopsy-proven skin lesions caused by Fusarium species and the blood cultures yielded the organism in 3 of these 4 patients. Maxillary sinusitis was the presenting manifestation of Fusarium infection in 2 of these 4 patients, suggesting that paranasal sinuses are potential portals of entry for the infection. Eight patients had a hematological malignancy and 7 were neutropenic at the onset of their infection. Patients with deep-seated infections remained neutropenic and died from infection despite treatment with amphotericin B. All 5 isolates tested in vitro showed resistance to ketoconazole and miconazole, whereas 3 were susceptible to amphotericin B. Fusarium species could play a role in producing myelosuppression and fungal cultures are required to differentiate it from the more commonly encountered Aspergillus species. Fusarium species are emerging as a serious, potentially fatal, pathogen in patients with cancer.\r"

Muscle biopsy morphometric analysis revealed that muscle fiber atrophy was greatest for the vastus medialis and least for the rectus femoris. The atrophic response for type 1 fibers was, in order from most to least atrophied: VM greater than VL greater than RF, whereas for type 2 fibers the corresponding order was VM = VL greater than RF. An increase in connective tissue was also observed for all muscles. These results are discussed in terms of skeletal muscle architecture, initial fiber-type distribution, and level of use. As a result, predictions are made as to the muscles that are most vulnerable to disuse atrophy, namely the postural muscles that contain a relatively large proportion of slow muscle fibers and cross a single joint. Conversely, those that are least susceptible to atrophy are those that are not used as postural muscles, that cross multiple joints, and that are predominantly composed of fast muscle fibers.\r"

The symptom of myotonia was present mainly in the legs, whereas transient weakness was the prominent symptom in the arms. Tocainide improved both symptoms, although it improved the stiffness more than the weakness. A specimen of intact muscle fibers was excised from the external intercostal muscle of one of the patients. The resting potential of the fibers was normal, but on injection of depolarizing current the fibers responded with repetitive action potentials. In normal interstitial fluid the current-voltage relationship was N-shaped, with a region of negative slope between -70 and -55 mV. Replacement of chloride by an impermeant anion changed this relationship very little, suggesting an abnormally small chloride conductance. The potassium current through the inward-going rectifier was larger than normal. The force of tetanic contractions of a rested bundle was not sustained but fell quickly to a plateau that increased with repeated stimulation. The relaxation of a rested tetanus was slow and accompanied by spontaneous electrical activity. In subsequent contractions the relaxation became faster and electrical after-activity decreased. However at 23 degrees C the speed of relaxation was always high despite a large amount of electrical after-activity. The electrical instability of the membrane and the transient weakness can be explained on the basis of the N-shaped membrane characteristic.\r"

Normal subjects performed repeated lengthening contractions with either arms or legs designed to result in mild muscle injury. One hour after the arm exercise, there was a significant increase in the inorganic phosphate to phosphocreatine ratio (Pi/PCr), with the maximum increase in Pi/PCr occurring 1 day postexercise (0.12 +/- 0.01 to 0.21 +/- 0.05). Pi/PCr remained elevated for 3-10 days. Similar results were seen following the leg exercise protocol. ATP/(Pi + PCr) decreased in all the arm exercised subjects. Exercise protocols that did not contain lengthening contractions did not result in changes of Pi/PCr or ATP/(Pi + PCr). Patients with various neuromuscular diseases with evidence of muscle damage (elevated CK, muscle soreness, and histopathological findings) also showed increased Pi/PCr at rest. We conclude that elevated Pi/PCr at rest can reflect nonspecific muscle damage in normal and diseased subjects.\r"

In comparison to normals, mF AMP/M--but not mF AMP--values were increased at statistically significant levels in all patients groups. M amplitudes were decreased (versus normal, P less than 0.005) in the patients with either peripheral or central lesions. In these patients, the normal significant correlation between mF AMP and M amplitudes may be disrupted, whereas the data suggest that increased mF AMP ratios in neuropathies are related to their duration. These results indicate that mF AMP/M ratios can be increased not only with increased central excitability but also in peripheral neuropathies. Although mechanisms may differ, the data are consistent with a similar physiological response to peripheral and central injury and emphasize that M amplitudes may be decreased with central lesions.\r"

Previous studies of such shortened muscles have shown that the number of sarcomeres in series is reduced, but how the sarcomeres are reduced has not been determined. We observed that the fibers in the mid-belly region of the muscles demonstrated a progressive degenerative process over the first few weeks. Myofibrils across the entire width of the affected fibers underwent dissolution. However, by 4 weeks new myofibrils were being formed, and sarcomere lengths appeared normal. Portions of the fibers near the tendon underwent segmental necrosis. These findings are similar to the response of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles to tenotomy and are clinically relevant to orthopedic procedures that maintain muscles in shortened conditions for prolonged periods.\r"

Statistically significant correlation was found between the Valsalva test abnormality, the degree of peripheral neuropathy, and the SSR in our patients. All patients with orthostatic hypotension had an absent SSR and an abnormal Valsalva test. Most patients had one or more autonomic signs or symptoms. Orthostatic dizziness only correlated with SSR, however. These results suggest that sudomotor activity detected by sympathetic skin response is a valuable test for investigation of dysautonomia in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\r"

Since the success of this neurosurgical approach to dopamine-replacement therapy may depend on the selection of the most appropriate subregion of the striatum for implantation, we examined the pattern and degree of dopamine loss in striatum obtained at autopsy from eight patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. We found that in the putamen there was a nearly complete depletion of dopamine in all subdivisions, with the greatest reduction in the caudal portions (less than 1 percent of the dopamine remaining). In the caudate nucleus, the only subdivision with severe dopamine reduction was the most dorsal rostral part (4 percent of the dopamine remaining); the other subdivisions still had substantial levels of dopamine (up to approximately 40 percent of control levels). We propose that the motor deficits that are a constant and characteristic feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease are for the most part a consequence of dopamine loss in the putamen, and that the dopamine-related caudate deficits (in \"higher\" cognitive functions) are, if present, less marked or restricted to discrete functions only. We conclude that the putamen--particularly its caudal portions--may be the most appropriate site for intrastriatal application of dopamine-producing autografts in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.\r"

In this paper we present a new framework for estimating the future balance between supply and demand with respect to physicians' services. Our analysis suggests that even if competitive medical plans serve approximately half the population by the year 2000, there will probably be little or no physician surplus. Moreover, if a slight surplus should occur, it is likely to be largely erased by increased involvement of physicians in administrative activities and a variety of nontraditional clinical activities that currently occupy little of a physician's time. Our prediction of little or no surplus could be altered appreciably, however, by two forces that would have opposite effects: an acceleration of technological change would increase demand beyond our projections, whereas widespread rationing of beneficial services would constrain the demand for physicians' services.\r"

To test for such an association among women, we examined the incidence of stroke in relation to cigarette smoking in a prospective cohort study of 118,539 women 30 to 55 years of age and free from coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer in 1976. During eight years of follow-up (908,447 person-years), we identified 274 strokes, comprising 71 subarachnoid hemorrhages, 26 intracerebral hemorrhages, 122 thromboembolic strokes, and 55 strokes about which information was insufficient to permit classification. The number of cigarettes smoked per day was associated positively with the risk of stroke. Compared with the women who had never smoked, those who smoked 1 to 14 cigarettes per day had an age-adjusted relative risk of 2.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.3), whereas those who smoked 25 or more cigarettes per day had a relative risk of 3.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 5.1). For women in this latter group, the relative risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was 9.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 5.3 to 17.9), as compared with those who had never smoked. Adjustment for the effects of relative weight, hypertension, diabetes, history of high cholesterol, previous use of oral contraceptives, postmenopausal estrogen therapy, and alcohol intake did not appreciably alter the association between cigarette use and incidence of stroke. These prospective data support a strong causal relation between cigarette smoking and stroke among young and middle-aged women.\r"

Thirty-nine patients with coronary artery disease and 12 controls were studied by radionuclide ventriculography. Of the patients with coronary artery disease, 23 (59 percent) had wall-motion abnormalities during periods of mental stress and 14 (36 percent) had a fall in ejection fraction of more than 5 percentage points. Ischemia induced by mental stress was symptomatically \"silent\" in 19 of the 23 patients with wall-motion abnormalities (83 percent) and occurred at lower heart rates than exercise-induced ischemia (P less than 0.05). In contrast, we observed comparable elevations in arterial pressure during ischemia induced by mental stress and ischemia induced by exercise. A personally relevant, emotionally arousing speaking task induced more frequent and greater regional wall-motion abnormalities than did less specific cognitive tasks causing mental stress (P less than 0.05). The magnitude of cardiac dysfunction induced by the speaking task was similar to that induced by exercise. Personally relevant mental stress may be an important precipitant of myocardial ischemia--often silent--in patients with coronary artery disease. Further examination of the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress could have important implications for the treatment of transient myocardial ischemia.\r"

In this cohort the relative risk of bladder cancer was 6.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 14.2).

Three of the nine patients were 50 years of age or younger; seven died with progressive bladder cancer. Subsequently, an additional patient had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Hemorrhagic cystitis was observed in 33 patients (cumulative risk, 11.8 +/- 2.1 percent after five years). Development of carcinoma of the urinary bladder was not related to previous hemorrhagic cystitis. The results caution against long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide for diseases with a favorable prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the extent of inappropriate hospital use in pediatric inpatients, I modified the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP)--developed to assess inappropriate hospital use in adults--to apply to children and used it to evaluate pediatric inpatients retrospectively for every 10th day, from July 1982 to July 1983, at the University of Wisconsin Hospital. Of 1098 patient-days evaluated, 21.4 percent were judged to represent inappropriate hospital use on the basis of the protocol's criteria. The rate of inappropriate use varied according to admitting specialty, ranging from 7 of 70 days (10 percent) for pulmonary medicine to 43 of 61 days (70 percent) for neurology (P less than 0.005). There was a tendency toward lower rates of inappropriate use in uninsured patients (6 of 44 days [14 percent] vs. 226 of 1038 days [22 percent] in patients with Medicaid or private insurance, P = 0.13), and rates were lower in younger children (74 of 432 days [17 percent] in children less than or equal to 5 years of age vs. 162 of 656 days [25 percent] in children greater than 5 years of age, P less than 0.005). There was no variation according to sex, day of the week, or month. Contrary to expectations, inappropriate use decreased with increased lengths of stay (for stays of 1 day, 8 of 13 days were inappropriate [61 percent]; for stays of 2 to 6 days, 118 of 410 days were inappropriate [29 percent]; for 7 to 13 days, 58 of 291 [20 percent]; and for greater than or equal to 14 days, 51 of 362 [14 percent], P less than 0.001). I conclude that there is a substantial rate of inappropriate hospital use in pediatrics and that such use is more likely during short admissions than during long ones. Cost-containment efforts directed at limiting the length of hospitalization may therefore not reduce inappropriate hospital use in this population.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of most cases of human obesity is unknown. Specific alterations in the activity of the autonomic nervous system may mediate and perhaps cause obesity in animal models. We therefore looked for alterations in autonomic activity in human obesity. Fifty-six healthy men with various percentages of body fat underwent autonomic testing while at rest. Significant correlations were found between the percentage of body fat and the variation in the R-R interval after beta-adrenergic blockade (r = -0.30, P less than 0.03), the heart rate (r = 0.30, P less than 0.03), the plasma norepinephrine concentration (r = -0.30, P less than 0.05), the plasma epinephrine concentration (r = -0.49, P less than 0.001), and the pupillary latency period (r = 0.39, P less than 0.01). Each of these variables reflects the activity of the sympathetic nervous system or parasympathetic nervous system or both. Depressions in sympathetic and parasympathetic activity were significantly but weakly associated with increasing percentages of body fat. These associations indicate that in obese persons, autonomic changes, though not necessarily causal, involve several organ systems. We suggest that autonomic alterations are important in human obesity, as they are in animal obesity. A disordered homeostatic mechanism may promote excessive storage of energy by decreasing sympathetic activity, while defending against weight gain by decreasing parasympathetic activity. The use of autonomic profiles holds promise for classifying human obesity and identifying obese patients at increased risk for various disorders.\r"

A large population of coarsely tuned collicular neurons is active before each saccade. The mechanisms by which the signals that precisely control the direction and amplitude of a saccade are extracted from the activity of the population are unknown. It has been assumed that the exact trajectory of a saccade is determined by the activity of the entire population and that information is not extracted from only the most active cells in the population at a subsequent stage of neural processing. The trajectory of a saccade could be based on vector summation of the movement tendencies provided by each member of the population of active neurons or be determined by a weighted average of the vector contributions of each neuron in the active population. Here we present the results of experiments in which a small subset of the active population was reversibly deactivated with lidocaine. These results are consistent with the predictions of the latter population-averaging hypothesis and support the general idea that the direction, amplitude and velocity of saccadic eye movements are based on the responses of the entire population of cells active before a saccadic eye movement.\r"

Previous studies have shown that administration of nerve growth factor before or at the same time as the lesion will prevent this cell death. Here we demonstrate that basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) administered into the brain reduces the death of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca after transection of their axons, in both young adult and aged rats. Moreover, FGF can partially protect against death of cholinergic neurons even when administered two days after axonal transection. These results indicate a possible function for FGF in the normal support of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, but its range of activity could be wider, for FGF also supports noncholinergic neurons in vitro, it is localized in many of the central nervous system neurons, and it is found in relatively high concentrations in the brain.\r"

The molecular mechanism(s) by which LPS induces these various secretory responses is unknown. We previously reported that LPS promotes the myristoylation of several macrophage proteins including one with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 68K2. We have now found that by several criteria the 68K myristoylated protein is similar or identical to the 80/87K protein, a major specific substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) found in brain and fibroblasts (for review see refs 7,8). We have also found that the myristoylated PKC substrate is quantitatively associated with the membrane fraction. Myristoylation of the PKC substrate may target it to the membrane and constitute a transduction pathway for stimulus-response coupling.\r"

  ".W": "The geometric information used to solve three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins by NMR spectroscopy resides in short (less than 5 A) interproton-distance data. To obtain these distances, the 1H-NMR spectrum must first be assigned using correlation and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments to demonstrate through-bond (scalar) and through-space connectivities, respectively. Because the NOE is proportional to r-6, distance information can then be derived. The increased resolution afforded by extending NMR experiments into a second dimension enables one to detect and interpret effects that would not be possible in one dimension owing to extensive spectral overlap and much reduced information. A number of small protein structures have previously been solved in this way. Extending this methodology to larger proteins, however, requires yet an additional improvement in resolution as overlap of cross-peaks in the two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra present a major barrier to their unambiguous identification. One way of increasing the resolution is to extend the 2D-NMR experiments into a third dimension. We report here the applicability of three-dimensional NMR to macromolecules using the 46-residue protein alpha 1-purothionin as an example.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between helper T cells and B cells, leading to the production of antibody to thymus-dependent antigens, was the first cell interaction clearly defined in the immune system; it remains both paradigmatic and controversial. Two requirements of this interaction, that the helper cell (TH) and the B cell must recognize antigenic determinants that are physically linked, and that the TH and the B cell must share genes encoding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, led to the concept that TH-B interaction required an intimate physical association of the two cell types. But in vitro studies have shown that TH can be replaced by soluble, antigen-nonspecific factors, capable of activating any B cell to secrete antibody. We have previously proposed that the requirements for TH-B contact might result from TH cells releasing their lymphokines in a polar fashion directed at that portion of the cell membrane where T-cell receptor cross-linking is actually occurring. Using an artificial monolayer of a cloned helper T-cell line, we show that lymphokines are released preferentially over the area of receptor cross-linking under conditions of limited TH-cell activation. Thus, it appears that one important aspect of the specificity of TH-B cell interactions is the receptor-directed polar release of helper lymphokines.\r"

  ".W": "Receptive fields (RFs) obtained at specific cortical sites can be used to define a topographic map of the body surface in adult mammalian somatosensory cortex. This map is not static, and RFs at particular cortical sites can change in size and location throughout adult life. Conversely, the cortical loci at which a given skin surface is represented can shift hundreds of micrometres across the cortex in the koniocortical field, area 3b (refs 1-12). This plasticity suggests that RFs derive not from rigid anatomical connections, but by the selection of a subset of a large number of inputs. We have proposed that inputs are selected on the basis of temporal correlation 11-15. Here we test this idea by altering the correlation of inputs from two adjacent digits on the adult owl monkey hand by surgically connecting the skin surfaces of the two fingers (the formation of syndactyly). This manipulation increases the correlation of inputs from skin surfaces of adjacent fingers. The striking discontinuity between the zones of representation of adjacent digits on the somatosensory cortex disappeared. These results support the hypothesis that the topography of the body-surface map in the adult cortex is influenced by the temporal correlations of afferent inputs.\r"

  ".W": "The somatosensory cortex of adult mammals has been shown to have a capacity to reorganize when inputs are removed by cutting afferent nerves or amputating a part of the body. The area of cortex that would normally respond to stimulation of the missing input can become responsive to inputs from other parts of the body surface. Although a few animals have been studied with repeat recording, no attempt has been made to follow the time-course of changes at cortical loci and the immediate effects of a small amputation have not been reported. We have followed the changes in response in the primary somatosensory cortex in the flying-fox following amputation of the single exposed digit on the forelimb. Immediately after amputation, neurons in the area of cortex receiving inputs from the missing digit were not silent but responded to stimulation of adjoining regions of the digit, hand, arm and wing. In the week following amputation, the enlarged receptive fields shrank until they covered only the skin around the amputation wound. The immediate response is interpreted as a removal of inhibition and the subsequent shrinking of the field may be due to re-establishment of the inhibitory balance in the affected cortex and its inputs.\r"

Korsakoff's psychosis, a disease in which alcohol poisoning causes apparently irreversible memory defects, is characterized by lesions in cholinergic and noradrenergic nuclei and by a decrease in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the content of noradrenaline (NA) in forebrain areas such as cerebral cortex and hippocampus, innervated by these nuclei. Prolonged intake of ethanol in rodents similarly produces signs of noradrenergic and cholinergic deafferentation in the cortex and hippocampus, as well as persistent memory deficits. To test whether alcohol-induced memory impairments depend on cholinergic deafferentation, we transplanted cholinergic-rich fetal basal forebrain cell suspensions into the cortex and hippocampus of alcohol-treated rats. The substantial and persistent memory losses produced in our rats by ethanol intake were associated with an impairment of cholinergic function, and were reversed by cholinergic-rich transplants into cortex and hippocampus.\r"

We have cloned the gene for pig muscle phosphohexose isomerase (PHI) (EC 5.3.1.9) which catalyses the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, an obligatory step in glycolysis, and determined its amino-acid sequence.

Polge, personal communication), and the eight-cell stage in the sheep. Information about the timing of activation of the embryonic genome in the human is of relevance not only to the therapeutic practice of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF), but more importantly for the successful development of techniques for the preimplantation diagnosis of certain inherited genetic diseases. We describe here changes in the pattern of polypeptides synthesized during the pre-implantation stages of human development, and demonstrate that some of the major qualitative changes which occur between the four- and eight-cell stages are dependent on transcription. In addition, it appears that cleavage is not sensitive to transcriptional inhibition until after the four-cell stage.\r"

  ".W": "Two glucose-regulated proteins, GRP78 and GRP94, are major constituents of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells. These proteins are synthesized constitutively in detectable amounts under normal growth conditions; they can also be induced under a variety of conditions of stress including glucose starvation and treatment with drugs that inhibit cellular glycosylation, with calcium ionophores or with amino-acid analogues. Unlike the closely-related heat shock protein (HSP) family, the GRPs are not induced significantly by high temperature. Recently, GRP78 has been identified as the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) (ref. 5 and Y.K. et al., in preparation) which binds transiently to a variety of nascent, wild-type secretory and transmembrane proteins and permanently to malfolded proteins that accumulate within the ER. We have tested the hypothesis that the presence of malfolded proteins may be the primary signal for induction of GRPs by expressing wild-type and mutant forms of influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) in simian cells. Only malfolded HAs, whose transport from the ER is blocked, induced the synthesis of GRPs 78 and 94. Additional evidence is presented that malfolding per se, rather than abnormal glycosylation, is the proximal inducer of this family of stress proteins.\r"

In an attempt to define the helical parameters determining this sequence-dependence, we have co-crystallized a complex of DNase I with a self-complementary octanucleotide and refined the crystal structure at 2 A resolution. This structure confirms the basic features of an early model, namely that an exposed loop of DNase I binds in the minor groove of B-type DNA and that interactions do occur with the backbone of both strands. Nicked octamer duplexes that have lost a dinucleotide from the 3'-end of one strand are hydrogen-bonded across a two-fold axis in the crystal to form a quasi-continuous double helix of 14 base pairs. The DNA 14-mer has a B-type conformation and shows substantial distortion of both local and overall helix parameters, induced mainly by the tight interaction of Y73 and R38 in the unusually wide minor groove. Directly coupled to the widening of the groove by approximately 3A is a 21.5 degree bend of the DNA away from the bound enzyme towards the major groove, suggesting that both DNA stiffness and groove width are important in determining the sequence-dependence of the enzyme cutting rate. A second cut of the DNA which is induced by diffusion of Mn2+ into the co-crystals suggests that there are two active sites in DNase I separated by more than 15A.\r"

Type A patients have fast flow fistulas that are manifest by a direct connection between the internal carotid arterial siphon and the cavernous sinus through a single tear in the arterial wall. The best therapy is obliteration of the connection by a detachable balloon. Ninety-two of 95 traumatic CCFs were treated in this fashion. Direct surgical exposure of the cervical or cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) was necessary in the remaining 3 patients, who had undergone unsuccessful surgical trapping. Three ruptured cavernous aneurysms and 2 spontaneous CCFs also had Type A connections. Other carotid-cavernous fistulas are slow flow, spontaneous dural arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that have been classified into B, C, and D types on the basis of arterial supply. Occlusion of the ICA is not a logical choice in the treatment of dural AVMs that occur in the elderly, are relatively benign, and are often bilateral. Type B are rare and are fed by meningeal branches of the ICA only. We have not seen this type of dural fistula in our series. Type C are supplied by feeders from the external carotid only and can almost always be obliterated successfully by embolizing the external carotid artery (ECA) branches. There are 4 Type C cases in this series of 37 spontaneous CCFs. All occurred in patients less than 30 years of age and were shunts between the middle meningeal artery and the cavernous sinus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Certain circumstances of flow dynamics and anatomy, however, make an endovascular approach difficult for even an experienced interventional neuroradiologist. Fistulas involving the posterior carotid wall at its proximal cavernous entry and the anterior carotid wall in its initial horizontal intracavernous segment, as well as very low flow fistulas at other sites, have posed particular problems. Three patients with such traumatic fistulas whose endovascular treatment failed were managed by the direct transdural introduction of balloons. Intraoperative angiography was accomplished with open internal carotid artery (ICA) catheterization and the use of a portable C-arm with a 6-in. image intensifier. After temporal craniectomy and subtemporal exposure, the course of the cavernous ICA was mapped out with spinal needles and the site of the fistula was localized by intraoperative angiography. An incision was then made in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, and latex balloons were manually introduced via a 7 French introducer sheath. The balloons were inflated under angiographic control and detached when the fistula was obliterated. This simple technique was initially successful in three patients; the fistula was eliminated with preservation of carotid patency. One patient suffered a recurrence of his fistula 2 months postoperatively while lifting weights, and one patient developed a new 3rd nerve palsy after operation.\r"

Detachable balloons allow test occlusion of a vascular pedicle before permanent occlusion and can obliterate aneurysms in feeding arteries. We describe 36 feeder arterial balloon occlusions performed in 31 patients. Twenty-nine patients subsequently had surgical resection. None of the patients developed normal perfusion pressure breakthrough or required blood transfusions. The preoperative balloon occlusion was judged by the neurosurgeon to decrease significantly the difficulty in surgical resection of the malformation. The remaining 2 patients underwent embolization before radiosurgery. One patient had aneurysms in the feeding artery, which was balloon-occluded to diminish the risk of hemorrhage. There were two neurological deficits and three asymptomatic arterial dissections related to the balloon procedure. Balloon occlusion of feeding arterial pedicles in selected cerebral AVMs may be a valuable surgical adjunct.\r"

Increased content of water was observed only in the compressed lumbar cord segments of paralyzed rats (P less than 0.04). A progressive increase in specific gravity values of the compressed segments accompanied the increasing severity of neurological dysfunction (P less than 0.003 in paraplegic rats). Electron microscopy of the compressed cord revealed enlarged interstitial spaces, myelin breakdown, and extravasated blood cellular elements. Treatment with dexamethasone (10 mg/kg q 12 hr x 3) failed to reduce the increased content of water, but corrected specific gravity changes. Treatment with indomethacin (10 mg/kg q 12 hr x 3) reduced both elevated water content and specific gravity values back to normal levels. In untreated animals, the interval between the first neurological sign (limp tail) and paraplegia was 2.8 +/- 0.34 days (mean +/- SE). Treatment with dexamethasone lengthened this period by 28.6% (P less than 0.05); treatment with indomethacin lengthened it by 66.4% (P less than 0.005). We conclude that, because the specific gravity measurements in this model reflect complex pathophysiological processes, their translation into water content values is not advisable. Pharmacological intervention with indomethacin compares favorably with dexamethasone in reduction of spinal cord edema and in delaying the onset of paraplegia.\r"

At operation 41/2 months after his injury and 1 month after complete paraplegia, a myelotomy at C6 failed to reveal any cavity (syrinx) but instead disclosed only intense gliosis inside a slightly atrophic spinal cord. Rapid clinical improvement ensued. Secondary syringomyelia may be an endstage condition after spinal cord insults that trigger a progressive, pathophysiological reaction leading to central cord necrosis.

  ".W": "Complications associated with the use of perioperative steroids in elective craniotomies were evaluated in a single-blind prospective study of 222 consecutive microvascular decompression operations. Patients were randomized into one of three groups: Group A received steroids preoperatively and for 4 days postoperatively, Group B received steroids pre- and postoperatively for 1 day, and Group C received no steroids. There were 17 complications in Group A; 12 of these were wound-related. There were significantly fewer complications in Groups B and C (P less than 0.01). Group B had 3 complications, Group C had 4, and there was only 1 wound-related complication in Group C. There were no deaths, deep wound infections, or life-threatening complications. Severe postoperative headaches, a symptom that steroids were intended to minimize, occurred in 38% of patients in Group A, 42% of patients in Group B, and 25% of patients in Group C. The use of perioperative steroids did not reduce the length of postoperative hospitalization. Duration of the operation had no significant effect on the incidence of postoperative complications or the length of postoperative hospitalization. We conclude that there is no indication for the routine perioperative use of steroids with microvascular decompression operations of the posterior fossa cranial nerves and that such use leads to a higher incidence of postoperative complications.\r"

In these patients, there was an intermittent horizontal torticollis characterized by aggravation of the symptoms when in a resting posture, presenting with a striking contrast to the torticollis of extrapyramidal origin that was alleviated while in the resting posture and aggravated by postural stress. A tight neurovascular contact was observed at the C1 level, occurring between the principal 11th nerve and the vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Nerve decompression was achieved in 2 by transposing the compressing artery and in 5 by sectioning at C1 or C2 the branching root of the 11th nerve that had caused the tight cross contact by locking the nerve trunk to the dura mater. The symptoms had improved after an interval of 1 to 4 weeks. After an average follow-up of 3 years, full or satisfactory relief had been obtained in 5 and some improvement had occurred in 2 patients. Possible neural mechanisms related to torticollis of 11th nerve origin are discussed.\r"

Fifty-one frozen glioma specimens were stained with Ki-67 using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase system. For each tumor, six different randomly selected fields were examined. The percentage of Ki-67-positive cells in the total number of cells in the five fields counted with counterstaining has been calculated. The areas of necrosis and the vascular endothelial cells when they were distinguishable were not included in the calculation. The indices determined on this material ranged from 0% to 4.5% (mean, 1.0; SD, 1.5) for 16 low grade astrocytomas; from 0.7% to 7.4% (mean, 3.5; SD, 2.2) for 8 anaplastic astrocytomas; and from 1.7% to 32.2% (mean, 11.1; SD, 8.2) for 27 glioblastomas. The differences among the means of each group are statistically significant. Five patients with malignant gliomas with an index of less than 2.5 had survival times of more than 40 weeks. These results show that the Ki-67 index of proliferating cells in human gliomas correlates with the usual histological classification of these tumors. There is a potential interest in using this technique in routine histopathology because it is simple and more rapid than the classic methods of evaluation of proliferating cells.\r"

T1 and T2 relaxation characteristics of the adenomas were evaluated on MRI examinations, and contrast enhancement characteristics were evaluated on CT examinations. MRI was superior to CT for detecting the extrasellar extent of tumor. Within the sella turcica, MRI and CT were equivalent with regard to lesion detection, except for 1 patient in whom CT was able to detect a surgically confirmed 3-mm microadenoma that was not visualized on the MRI examination.\r"

Hypogonadism caused by pituitary adenomas is usually attributed to either hyperprolactinemia or irreversible destruction of normal pituitary tissue, neither of which is applicable to this patient. The recovery of our patient's gonadal function after operation suggests that a reversible compression of viable tissue or impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary communications was responsible for his endocrine deficiency.\r"

Four of seven patients in groups II and III improved at least moderately with only anticholinergic medication. The coexistence of focal tremor and focal dystonia in the same limb in 10 patients (group III) suggests a link between these focal disorders.

Eight patients (33%) had partial remissions, which tended to occur somewhat later than the first group. The remaining 13 patients had no significant improvement in their disease; they were more likely to be older at the onset of the illness, develop constant rather than intermittent neck deviation, and have a \"geste antagonistique.\" As a whole, the study population was exposed to a wide variety of therapeutic interventions that had little, if any, obvious clinical effect.\r"

  ".W": "A recent clinical trial of controlled-release carbidopa/levodopa preparation afforded us the opportunity to examine the effects of chronically increasing circulating 3-O-methyldopa (OMD) levels on the clinical response to levodopa. In patients taking standard Sinemet, both mean plasma OMD levels and the area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) obtained during 8-hour periods of blood sampling correlated highly with the total daily intake of levodopa. In patients taking the controlled-release formulation, the mean daily intake of levodopa was doubled. This, in turn, led to a doubling of the mean OMD level and its AUC, whereas the AUC for levodopa was unchanged. Despite the increase in circulating OMD there was no reduction in mobility in either the \"on\" or \"off\" conditions. Thus, doubling plasma OMD levels did not seem to interfere with brain uptake of levodopa sufficiently to cause a deterioration in its therapeutic efficacy in these patients.\r"

Parkinsonian subjects did significantly worse in tests that required visuoperceptual and perceptual motor abilities, such as Object Assembly, Block Design, and Zazzo's test. Analysis of covariance of test scores showed that Block Design and Object Assembly scores were not significantly different between patients and controls when adjusted for reaction and movement times. Also, reaction and movement times were more delayed in parkinsonian patients than in controls. These results stress the main role of motor dysfunction in visuospatial and perceptual motor impairment.\r"

Velocities for both movements were proportionately reduced in all stages of disease. L-Dopa administration provided a small but consistent increase in distal movement velocity for most patients, whereas in patients with advanced disease (stages III to V), axial movement velocity actually declined after administration of L-dopa. This decline may be partially responsible for the failure of L-dopa administration to reverse the loss of \"righting reflexes\" in these patients. Measurement of axial motor control may be a useful tool in evaluating therapeutics for Parkinson's disease patients.\r"

In five with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, needle EMG and determination of size of ulnar sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) and thenar M waves were important in localizing the lesion; F-response and somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) studies were of more limited utility. All electrodiagnostic studies were normal in 10 patients with nonneurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. In traumatic (three patients) or idiopathic brachial plexopathy (five patients), needle EMG was especially helpful but, in the former, SEP studies helped to guide management and, in the latter, to confirm the proximal site of the lesion when peripheral SNAPs were normal. The presence of preserved but small SNAPs but absent M waves in patients with traumatic plexopathies suggested a combined pre- and postganglionic lesion.\r"

Two young agricultural workers with a parkinsonian syndrome, who mentioned exposure to the fungicide maneb (manganese ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate), led us to investigate a new possible source of Mn intoxication. Fifty male rural workers with occupational exposure to maneb were compared with 19 rural workers without fungicide exposure. We noted significantly higher prevalence of plastic rigidity with cogwheel phenomenon, headache, fatigue, nervousness, memory complaints, and sleepiness in the exposed group. In addition, we saw other neurologic signs, such as postural tremor, cerebellar signs, and bradykinesia, although without statistical significance. The data suggest that occupational exposure to pesticides containing Mn is a possible source of Mn intoxication of the CNS.\r"
