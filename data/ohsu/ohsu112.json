  ".W": "Salmonellae differing in the O-antigen side chain of their lipopolysaccharide were previously shown to activate the alternative pathway of complement to different extents. We now examine the generation of the major cleavage fragment of the complement component C3 (C3b) on these bacteria in a system that contains the purified components C3, B, D, and P but lacks the regulatory proteins H and I. The deposition of C3b in this system reproduces the same pattern obtained earlier with the use of whole serum, with the expected differences among the strains bearing different O-antigen. However, two distinct mechanisms for these differences in C3b generation became apparent. The intermediate activating strain showed 3 to 4 times less initial deposition of C3b than the other two strains. In contrast, the least activating strain showed adequate initial deposition but poor amplification, as shown by 2 to 3.4 lower amplification indexes as compared with those on the other two strains. Binding studies with factor B showed that decreased C3 convertase formation was responsible for the low amplification on this strain. Only 25% of the C3b bound to its surface was able to bind factor B with a high affinity, in comparison with 90% on the other two strains. No differences were found for the binding of factor H among the strains. These studies identify the molecular mechanisms by which these bacteria avoid complement activation.\r"

  ".U": "87281646\r", 
  ".W": "Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) of human erythrocytes is a glycoprotein with a Mr of 65,000 that is anchored in the membrane via a glycolipid tail. During the purification of DAF, two lower m.w. forms were noted. DAF-A had an Mr of 63,000, and DAF-B had an Mr of 55,000. In a fluid phase assay, both forms accelerated the decay of the classical and the alternative C3 convertases with a specific activity similar to that of DAF. However, the decay-accelerating activity for the cell-bound C3 convertases was abolished, suggesting that neither could insert into E membranes and therefore that the glycolipid tail is altered. Analysis by molecular sieve high-pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated that DAF-A eluted with a Mr of approximately 450,000, similar to native DAF, and was thus in an aggregated form. In contrast, DAF-B eluted as a monomer with a Mr of approximately 60,000. DAF-A, but not DAF-B, bound to a hydrophobic column. To further characterize these two forms, surface-labeled human erythrocytes were incubated with phosphatidyl inositol-specific phospholipase C or papain. The phospholipase inefficiently released a form of DAF that was slightly larger (Mr of 64,000) than DAF-A. Papain efficiently released a 55,000 fragment that had the same Mr as DAF-B. To determine if DAF was cleaved by endogenous enzymes, surface-labeled erythrocytes were incubated with leukocytes. The kinetics of the leukocyte-induced degradation was similar to those observed with papain, and the released fragment aligned on seizing gels with the papain-derived fragment. We hypothesize that endogenous phospholipases and proteases cleave DAF to produce fragments similar to DAF-A and DAF-B, respectively.\r"

Because marked augmentation of Hageman factor (factor XII) titer is induced by estrogen intake in humans, we studied the factors participating in the surface-mediated reactions of clotting in patients with documented acute myocardial infarction. We report lower coagulant titers of Hageman factor, prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, and plasma thromboplastin antecedent (factor XI) in the plasma samples of patients with acute myocardial infarction than in control samples. Further, the plasma estradiol titers of patients with acute myocardial infarction were not significantly different from those of controls. In contrast, the prolactin concentration of patients with acute myocardial infarction was elevated. These data suggest that other nonhormonal factors such as excessive consumption may influence the observed reduction in the titers of surface-mediated clotting factors in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Four isonitrogenous diets were fed to each pig: W (whole wheat); WBS (whole wheat, wheat bran, wheat starch); WFS (whole wheat, wheat flour, wheat starch); and FC (wheat flour, wood cellulose). Wheat and wheat fractions came from the same batch of wheat. Crude fiber and dietary fiber (nonstarch polysaccharide) contents of diets W, WBS, WFS and FC (g/kg), respectively, were 40.8, 101.8; 63.7, 201.2; 20.5, 50.3; and 39.0, 60.7. Mean volumes of pancreatic juice (mL/24 h) for diets W, WBS, WFS and FC, respectively, were 4108, 4560, 2556 and 1757. Total enzymic and electrolyte concentrations were not significantly affected by diet changes, but mean protein and amylase outputs were lower for diet FC than for the others. It was concluded that the principal effect of increasing the dietary fiber content of the diets was to increase the volume of pancreatic juice and that this may have been due to noncellulosic components of the dietary fiber.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the growing incidence of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), the need for studies on animal models is urgent. Infection of chimpanzees with the retroviral agent of human AIDS, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), will have only limited usefulness because chimpanzees are in short supply and do not develop the disease. Among non-human primates, both type D retroviruses and lentiviruses can be responsible for immune deficiencies. The D-type retroviruses, although important pathogens in macaque monkey colonies, are not satisfactory as a model because they differ in genetic structure and pathophysiological properties from the human AIDS viruses. The simian lentivirus, previously referred to as simian T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (STLV-III), now termed simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is related to HIV by the antigenicity of its proteins and in its main biological properties, such as cytopathic effect and tropism for CD4-bearing cells. Most importantly, SIV induces a disease with remarkable similarity to human AIDS in the common rhesus macaques, which therefore constitute the best animal model currently available. Natural or experimental infection of other monkeys such as African green monkeys or sooty mangabeys has not yet been associated with disease. Molecular approaches of the SIV system will be needed for biological studies and development of vaccines that could be tested in animals. We have cloned and sequenced the complete genome of SIV isolated from a naturally infected macaque that died of AIDS. This SIVMAC appears genetically close to the agent of AIDS in West Africa, HIV-2, but the divergence of the sequences of SIV and HIV-2 is greater than that previously observed between HIV-1 isolates.\r"

  ".W": "Microtubules are versatile cellular polymers that play a role in cell shape determination and mediate various motile processes such as ciliary and flagellar bending, chromosome movements and organelle transport. That a sliding microtubule mechanism can generate force has been demonstrated in highly ordered structures such as axonemes, and microtubule-based force generation almost certainly contributes to the function of mitotic and meiotic spindles. Most cytoplasmic microtubule arrays, however, do not exhibit the structural regularity of axonemes and some spindles, and often appear disorganized. Yet many cellular activities (such as shape changes during morphogenesis, axonal extension and spindle assembly) involve highly coordinated microtubule behaviour and possibly require force generated by an intermicrotubule sliding mechanism, or perhaps use sliding to move microtubules rapidly into a protrusion for stabilization. Here we show that active sliding between cytoplasmic microtubules can occur in microtubule bundles of the amoeba Reticulomyxa. A force-producing mechanism of this sort could be used by this organism to facilitate the extension of cell processes and to generate the dynamic movements of the cytoplasmic network.\r"

To aid in one's ability to deal with a chronic illness such factors as care, technology, family relationships, developmental level, cultural values and beliefs, communication, and economics need to be considered. An understanding of how each of these factors affects chronic illness can facilitate the appropriate development and initiation of options for adaptation to the illness.\r"

However, in its severest form, it can render the afflicted person bound to a wheelchair, house, or even a bed.

Coping with the existence of pain, disabling effects, and/or deformities brought on by rheumatoid arthritis is not an easy task for the afflicted person. To cope with the physical aspects of the disease, the afflicted person is likely to use the coping mechanisms of information seeking, direct action, inhibition of action, intrapsychic processes, and social support. Which coping mechanisms are used, how the mechanisms are used, and how effective the mechanisms are, must be determined by the nurse so that appropriate psychosocial interventions can be planned and implemented.\r"

  ".W": "The steps of the nursing process apply to needs of the spirit as well as body and mind. Several nurses have provided guidelines for assessing spiritual needs. Stoll, for example, considers four areas of concern: the person's concept of God; source of strength and hope; significance of religious practices and rituals; and perceived relationship between spiritual beliefs and state of health. In approaching the patient about these four areas, it is important for the nurse to clearly articulate the purpose in seeking such information. For instance, a nurse might explain to a patient that research has demonstrated the positive relationship of spiritual concerns to a patient's ability to cope with chronic illness. Because the nurse is interested in assisting the patient to identify, strengthen, and develop a variety of coping strategies, spiritually related data are relevant to the patient's care. Having collected data from the patients, a nursing diagnosis can be made. Spiritual concerns, spiritual distress, and spiritual despair have been included in the accepted classification system. Meeting the spiritual needs of patients can be uncomfortable for the nurse. Several reasons for such discomfort include embarrassment, the belief that it is not the nurse's role, lack of training, and the lack of own spiritual resources. Experience with an elective course in spirituality for undergraduate nursing students would support the value of offering training. Discussing God-related issues can assist a health care professional to clarify a personal spiritual position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nurses caring for the chronically ill need to be alert for the problems of social isolation and social impairment. Families often respond initially to serious illness by becoming over-protective and fostering dependence and a sense of impaired competence in the ill person. As the illness continues, families often experience exhaustion because of the demands of new roles, depleted finances, and other aspects of a changed lifestyle. Feelings of anger, guilt, and helplessness occur in the network, often leading to withdrawal of support--especially as the ill person's ability to reciprocate support is impaired. Nursing interventions in situations of social isolation focus on reducing isolation by promoting social interaction as appropriate, and by directly or indirectly mobilizing or expanding the social network. The problem of impaired social interaction may occur secondary to the personality changes that often accompany chronic illnesses, or as a function of the chronic illness or disability itself, as in the case of mental illnesses. Social impairment is an appropriate nursing diagnosis in abusive families. Nursing interventions range from educational programs for social skill development to reduction of the amount of contact within the network to involvement of protective and psychotherapy services. Chronic illness has profound effects on social support and the social network of both the ill person and his or her family. As both long-term illnesses and family involvement in care giving increase, nursing care in situations of chronic illness must include attention to issues of social support. Nursing diagnosis provides a framework for nurses to include social support in their care of the chronically ill patient. Social isolation and social impairment can be reduced by nursing interventions.\r"

In addition, it is easy to learn and teach to patients. Spiegel states that hypnosis, a group of techniques long associated with fantasies of loss of control, is ironically very helpful in actually enhancing patients' sense of control. The clinicians daring to become proficient in the use of hypnotic trance must begin with a conscious effort to abandon all negative suggestions such as \"Do you have pain?\"; \"How much do you hurt?\"; and \"Move your bad leg.\" Simultaneously, a conscious effort is made to increase the use of the following positive suggestions: \"How comfortable are you going to be tonight?\" \"Your hand feels so soft and warm\"; \"It is important to move this leg.\" These communication skills are best learned from clinicians skilled in hypnotherapeutic techniques. Simultaneously, it is important to become familiar with the works of Erikson and Barber. The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis will provide information about the national organizations and state hypnosis societies that offer approved workshops, conferences, and training opportunities. Hypnosis as analgesia surely provides rest, relaxation, and comfort for patients without the negative side effects of other analgesics. In addition, the ultimate benefit of hypnotic analgesia lies in enabling patients to potentiate their inner strength, resulting in improved self-esteem and self-control.\r"

The role of the nurse is paramount in applying these new technologies to pain control. The nurse must employ sound pain-management principles when choosing the route and delivery system that will meet the patient's needs. Nurses are responsible for implementation of the therapy, patient education, ongoing assessment, management of side effects, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the technique. Future innovations will lead to further advances in pain management techniques. As integral members of the health care team, nurses must be involved in the clinical research and evaluation of these new therapies. Advanced technology and supportive nursing care can then be united to ensure optimal pain control for our patients.\r"

  ".W": "Heparin is an acceleratory cofactor for antithrombin, a circulating inhibitor of blood coagulation enzymes. The presence of heparin on blood vessel walls is believed to contribute to the nonthrombogenic properties of those surfaces. In apparent opposition to this function, heparin was found to greatly accelerate the in vitro inactivation of antithrombin by neutrophil elastase. Inactivation rates in solution were potentiated several hundredfold by specific heparin fractions with anticoagulant activity. Although the data suggest that a heparin-antithrombin complex is essential for the inactivation by elastase to occur, the enzyme itself interacts tightly with heparin. These results suggest a mechanism which, if operating in vivo, could lead to a localized neutralization of the anticoagulant function of heparin at the endothelial surface.\r"

In this study the possibility that an antigen of HIV-1 suppresses neuronal responses to neurotrophic factors was examined. Both HIV-1 and a related retrovirus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), inhibited the growth of sensory neurons from chick dorsal root ganglia in medium containing neuroleukin (NLK) but not in medium containing nerve growth factor. An unrelated type D retrovirus, simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus, did not affect the growth of neurons in the presence of either neurotrophic factor. The inhibition by HIV-1 of neuron growth in the presence of NLK was found to be due to the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. Regions of sequence homology between gp120 and NLK may account for this inhibitory property of gp120 and functional interactions between gp120 and NLK may be important in the pathogenesis of the AIDS dementia complex.\r"

Of 196 asymptomatic men screened, 149 were antigen-negative/antibody-negative, 41 were antigen-negative/antibody-positive, and six were antigen-positive/antibody-positive. All three men in whom the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed over the next year were antigen-positive at enrollment. Although a larger portion of the men who were antigen-positive and did not demonstrate progression to AIDS after one year had thrush, zoster, or generalized lymphadenopathy, the associations were not statistically significant. Whereas all of the seropositive men had antibody to viral envelope antigens, about a quarter did not have detectable antibodies to recombinant core antigens. However, all of these men had detectable antibody to core antigens by Western blot. Titers to recombinant core and envelope antigens tended to be lower in the men with AIDS. HIV-infected persons who are more likely to have enhanced immuno-compromise may be identified by these newer tests, but further longitudinal studies will be necessary to fully understand their prognostic value.\r"

Some sera had HIV neutralizing antibody titers of several thousands. All serum samples had been titrated in two ELISAs based either on disrupted HTLV-IIIB or on a bacterially synthesized polypeptide (ENV-80) of gp41 as a test antigen. The correlation of neutralizing activity of the sera with ELISA titers was low. A correlation of serum neutralizing titers with the stage of the disease could not be observed. However, in a longitudinal study with 6 patients over up to 22 months an increase in neutralizing antibodies seemed to protect against progression of the disease. The implications of these findings for antibody treatment and vaccine development are discussed.\r"

The long terminal repeats (LTR) contained in clones of viral DNA of (STLV-III[AGM]) were subcloned in M13 and their DNA sequence was determined and compared with that of HIV (HTLV-III[BH10]). The STLV-III(AGM) LTR is considerably larger than that of HTLV-III(BH10) (800 bp vs 634 bp) and contains a 498 bp U3 region, a 176 bp R region, and a 126 bp U5 region. These two LTR sequences share regions of significant homology. Regions of greatest homology include the 5' portion of U3, a core enhancer sequence in U3, sequences including and surrounding the TATAA promoter box in U3 and the AATAAA polyadenylation/termination signal in R, and the 3'-most region of U5. The relatively larger size of the STLV-III LTR is due to the presence in all three parts of the LTR of sequences which have no apparent homolog in the HIV LTR. Overall, the two LTRs are 47% homologous. Even greater homology (75%) is evident with a 300 bp segment including R and some of U3 from the LTR of another human retrovirus, HIV-2/LAV-2. The STLV-III LTR contains an imperfect 28 bp direct repeat in the R region which is not present in HIV. There are no obvious direct repeats in U3 homologous to the 10 bp repeat in the U3 of HTLV-III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Defensins are a newly recognized class of small, cationic polypeptides that have in vitro microbicidal activity toward certain bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Human neutrophil granules were separated into 13 density fractions by using a high-resolution Percoll gradient centrifugation procedure, and the distribution of the three defensin polypeptides in these fractions was determined. Levels of defensins and several granule marker proteins were estimated in each fraction from relative staining intensities of bands following acid-urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of total acid-extractable proteins. These results were confirmed by enzyme immunoassay measurements of defensins and quantitative determinations of the typical azurophil granule components, myeloperoxidase, beta-glucuronidase, lysozyme, and elastase. The five higher density granule fractions (H1 through H5) contained fourfold higher relative amounts of defensins as compared with the eight lower density fractions (L1 through L8), accounting for approximately 50% of the total protein. In particular, fraction H5 was especially enriched in defensins but was relatively deficient in myeloperoxidase, beta-glucuronidase, lysozyme, and elastase. Ultrastructural morphology showed that fraction H5 contained the largest granules. Seventy percent of these granules exhibited electron-dense rims and electron-lucent central regions when stained with methanolic uranyl acetate-lead citrate, and 70% showed this same characteristic rim-staining pattern after limited reaction (30 minutes) for peroxidase with diaminobenzidine. These distinctively large, rim-stained granules were identified in intact, mature peripheral blood neutrophils as well as in human bone marrow promyelocytes, indicating that their synthesis occurs during early myeloid development. This unusual granule type may play a specialized role in the microbicidal functions of the neutrophil, distinct from that of typical azurophil granules.\r"

By December 1986, 82 (45%) were HIV seropositive, and of these, ten (12%) had developed AIDS, 28 (34%) had symptomatic HIV infection (CDC class III, IV), of whom 14 (17%) had AIDS-related complex (ARC), and 44 (54%) had asymptomatic HIV infection (CDC class II). The HIV seropositive group included 82% of those treated with factor VIII concentrate (97% severe, 5% moderate), 48% of those treated with factor IX concentrate (92% severe, 8% moderate), 10% of those treated with cryoprecipitate (67% severe, 33% moderate), and none of those treated with fresh frozen plasma. Based on 77 serially sampled HIV seropositive hemophiliacs (1977 to 1986), peak seroconversion occurred in 1982, with 14% (11 of 77) occurring since 1984. With increasing time from seroconversion, both T4 lymphocyte number and function (the latter measured by growth in soft agar [T colony assay]) progressively declined; T4 number declined to 135 +/- 26/mm3 (SEM), and colony count declined 1193 +/- 537 (control 3851 +/- 387) by 5 years after seroconversion. In those developing AIDS, total T4 fell below 100/mm3 (33 +/- 8/mm3) at diagnosis. In this cohort, the overall AIDS incidence is 5.5% (12% among the HIV seropositive) and in those seropositive 5 or more years, the AIDS incidence approaches 32%.\r"

WIM samples recovered from the cecum after fixed incubation times were analyzed and the rate of total disappearance of organic matter, cellulose, uronic acid and noncellulosic neutral sugars was calculated. Maximum degradation of each WIM occurred within 48 h after incubation and was for rutabaga and its ileal digesta 90 and 70%, respectively, and for bran and bran ileal digesta 55 and 45%, respectively. Cellulose and uronic acid in bran samples did not appear to be degraded, material disappearance being attributable to the loss of noncellulosic neutral sugars. Estimation of potential organic matter digestibility showed rutabaga to be 93%, rutabaga digesta 79%, bran 56% and bran digesta 43% digestible. Fractional rates of digestion in rutabaga samples were significantly faster than in corresponding bran samples. When related to the role of fiber in nutrition the results obtained suggest that cereal fiber would be only slightly modified during gut transit, unlike vegetable fiber in which microbial digestion would probably result in the total destruction of the fiber cell wall matrix.\r"

This resistance is in part due to the avascular nature, organization, and composition of the extracellular matrix. Extractable components (anti-invasion factors, [AIF]) within the matrix have been shown to be responsible for protecting the tissue against proteases produced by invading leucocytes. In the present study, AIF is examined for leucocyte elastase inhibitory activity using both analytical and preparative electrophoretic and chromatographic techniques. A specific leucocyte elastase inhibitor was isolated and identified as a 15,000 dalton protein on SDS-PAGE. The inhibitor is distinct from aprotinin (Trasylol) in size, electrophoretic pattern, and comparative peptide maps. The inhibitor exhibited a highly cationic (pI greater than 9.5) as well as a strong hydrophobic character. These properties of primary structure were confirmed by amino acid composition and sequence of the amino-terminal residues. The amino-terminal sequence showed no homologies to other proteins or known protease inhibitors. This matrix-derived protease inhibitor may be an important mediator in the regulation of and protection against cartilage destruction.\r"

Ninety-eight patients with AIDS manifest as opportunistic infections (n = 38), AIDS with Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 38), AIDS-related complex (n = 20), or AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (n = 2) were treated with suramin sodium at 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 g/wk for six weeks followed by maintenance therapy with 0.5 or 1.0 g/wk. Of 72 patients who were HIV culture positive before therapy and were assessable for subsequent HIV culture 40% became culture negative during treatment, with no apparent correlation between virus recovery and serum suramin concentration. No immunologic improvement was noted. One complete clinical remission was noted in a patient with Kaposi's sarcoma and stage IV NHL. Seven minor clinical responses were also noted. Toxic reactions were generally reversible, and included fever (78%), rash (48%), malaise (43%), nausea (34%), neurologic symptoms (33%), and vomiting (20%). Suramin-induced neutropenia was noted in 26%, thrombocytopenia in 12%, a serum creatinine level of 180 mumol/L or higher (greater than or equal to 2.1 mg/dL) in 12%, liver dysfunction in 14%, and clinical and/or laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency in 23%. Sixteen patients died while receiving suramin or within three weeks of discontinuation of drug therapy due to infection (n = 6), hepatic failure (n = 3), pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 2), AIDS encephalitis (n = 2), AIDS-associated NHL (n = 1), iatrogenic hemo-pneumothorax (n = 1), or pulmonary disease of uncertain etiology. Suramin as currently administered cannot be recommended as effective therapy for AIDS.\r"

Kallikrein was measured by a newly developed, very sensitive assay for kininogenase activity; active kallikrein was measured directly by this assay and total kallikrein after activation of inactive kallikrein. Kallikrein was readily detected in all of 17, late distal tubular fluid-samples. In contrast, kallikrein was too low to detect in 15 of 17 proximal or in 11 of 14 early distal tubular fluid samples. Calculations indicate that less than 10% of urinary kallikrein could have derived from filtration or from proximal secretion of kallikrein. We conclude that urinary kallikrein enters the urine via secretion in the distal tubule. Filtration or proximal secretion of kallikrein does not contribute significantly to urinary kallikrein excretion.\r"

  ".W": "Protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is triggered at several stages by information contained in the signal sequence. Initially, the signal sequence of a nascent secretory protein upon emergence from the ribosome is recognized by a polypeptide of relative molecular mass 54,000 (Mr54K) which is part of the signal recognition particle (SRP). Binding of SRP may induce a site-specific elongation arrest of translation in vitro. Attachment of the arrested translation complex to the ER membrane is mediated by the SRP-receptor (docking protein) and is accompanied by displacement of the SRP from both the ribosome and the signal sequence. We have investigated the fate of the signal sequence following the disengagement of SRP and its receptor by a crosslinking approach. We report here that the signal sequence of nascent preprolactin, after its release from the SRP, interacts with a newly discovered component, a signal sequence receptor (SSR), which is an integral, glycosylated protein of the rough ER membrane (Mr approximately 35K).\r"

The findings are not consistently in agreement with those of other researchers. For example, Hall et al. found that nearly two-thirds of nursing deans had planned their careers to attain that position. In this study, however, eighty-three percent of the respondents indicated that they had not planned their career advancement, but had simply taken opportunities that had come their way. The influence of others was important in the career advancement of these administrators. Many individuals, including faculty and nursing service colleagues, nursing directors, deans, and non-nursing administrators supported the respondents' personal and professional development through role modeling, teaching skills, and encouragement. Deliberate career planning and education in administration were, for the most part, lacking. Although the sample is too small to generate general conclusions about the universe of nurse executives, this does suggest that it is not uncommon for deans and service administrators to learn necessary skills on the job.\r"

This finding is significant because most intervention programs emphasize convincing clients of the effectiveness of their methods and treat difficulty as a given or a constant. These studies showed not only that difficulty varied, but also that the relationship between likelihood of adopting an activity and the perceived effectiveness and difficulty of the activity was multiplicative and, therefore, curvilinear. At low levels of difficulty, likelihood of adoption was high, but as difficulty increased, likelihood dropped rapidly. The relationship between effectiveness and likelihood, on the other hand, showed small increases in likelihood as effectiveness increased to moderate levels, with little increase at higher levels. These relationships were more pronounced among those for whom the target risk was highly relevant. One implication for practice is that a greater payoff will be realized by reversing the conventional focus of intervention and instead helping clients reduce the difficulty of adopting necessary activities.\r"

Analyses were based on 629 MS subjects. Principal component analysis and Varimax rotated factor analysis were used to achieve scale parsimony. The resultant 15-item scale was subjected to confirmatory factor analysis to determine relationships among factors, observed variables, and residual variances within the factor model. Modification of the initial factor model due to a less than satisfactory goodness-of-fit index (GFI) (0.848) resulted in the inclusion of four additional relationships between observed variables and a second factor and six paired relations among the residual variances. The modified factor model had a satisfactory GFI of 0.95. These findings support the development of a 15-item self-administered ADL Self-Care Scale. The scale can be used to screen ADL functional levels in MS persons or to monitor changes in their ADL over time.\r"

Five to 6 animals were killed at 2 h and at 3, 8, and 16 days after treatment. Electron micrographs were prepared from the hilar region of the left main intrapulmonary airway; 125 +/- 16 (mean +/- SE) granulated secretory cells extending from basement membrane to lumen were analyzed for each group. The number (Ng) and area (Ag) of granular profiles per cell, the area of cell profiles (Ac), and the volume density of secretory granules per cell (Vv) were determined using an electronic image analyzer. There were significant decreases in Ng, mean Ag, and Vv in the 2-h HNE group when compared with the saline group. Values of Ng, mean Ag, and Vv were similar for HNE and saline groups at 3 days, but were significantly increased at 8 and 16 days. The Ac of HNE-treated groups was similar to their saline control groups at all time points except at 16 days when the HNE-treated group enlarged to double that of its saline control group. An ultrastructural differential cell count showed a decrease in frequency of granulated secretory cells at 2 h and an increase at 8 and 16 days; there was an inverse change in the frequency of nongranulated secretory cells at these times. The proportion of ciliated, preciliated, and indeterminate cells remained constant over time in all treatment groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 11 infants the peak breath hydrogen concentration suggested extensive colonic fermentation (range 44-239 ppm/5% CO2 or 44-239 microL/L per 50 mL/L CO2). An approximate 100% increase in lactose intake in the LAC group was associated with a similar increase in breath hydrogen concentration at 30, 60, and 120 min. None of the infants exhibited diarrhea or vomiting or developed delayed gastric emptying. Carbohydrate energy absorption (mean +/- SD) was, respectively, 86 +/- 5% and 91 +/- 3% in the LAC and the LAC + GP groups (p greater than 0.05). Thus, colonic bacterial fermentation may be critical to energy balance and to the prevention of osmotic diarrhea in premature infants fed lactose.\r"

These features contrast sharply with those of the oldest artiodactyls and indicate that Chriacus or a similar arctocyonid was not ancestral to the Artiodactyla, as has been proposed.\r"

  ".W": "A community-wide study of patients hospitalized with validated acute myocardial infarction (MI) in all 16 hospitals in the Worcester metropolitan area, during the calendar years 1975, 1978, and 1981, is examining time trends in the incidence rates, in-hospital case fatality rates, and long-term survival rates of 2451 patients hospitalized with acute MI further classified into those with Q wave and those with non-Q wave MI. The age-adjusted hospital attack rates (per 100,000) of initial events of Q wave MI increased from 153 in 1975 to 197 in 1981 (p less than 0.05), while the attack rates of non-Q wave MI increased from 46 in 1975 to 89 in 1981 (p less than 0.001). Patients with non-Q wave MI were at significantly decreased risk of dying during hospitalization (12.0%) as compared to those with Q wave MI (25.2%), overall as well as for each of the three time periods studied (p less than 0.05). For patients discharged alive from the hospital, however, there were no significant differences in long-term survival rates according to MI type over an 8-year follow-up period. These results, obtained from a community-wide sample of patients with validated acute MI, indicate a significant change in the occurrence rates and/or recognition of non-Q wave MI, a significantly lower in-hospital case fatality rate for patients with non-Q wave MI, and comparable long-term prognosis for patients with Q wave and non-Q wave acute MI.\r"

Patients were divided into two groups based on age: a younger group (less than 70 years old) and an elderly group (greater than or equal to 70 years old). Among all cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the study period, the percentage of patients undergoing thoracotomy in both groups was comparable. Comparison of baseline features of the two groups revealed no statistical difference in the distribution of sex, smoking history, arterial blood gas values, degree of airflow obstruction, cell type, stage of cancer, or subsequent therapy. Potentially serious medical problems were more frequent in the elderly group, whereas the younger group had significantly higher values for several pulmonary function parameters and underwent a significantly higher proportion of pneumonectomies. Although operative mortality in the elderly group was greater (9.4% vs 4.0%; 95% confidence intervals, 3.5%, 19.3% vs 0.8%, 11.2%), [corrected] further analysis of outcomes revealed no statistically significant difference in the postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, or actuarial survival. We conclude that advanced age does not adversely affect prognosis following thoracotomy for lung cancer. Therefore, elderly patients with reasonable cardiopulmonary function should not be denied potentially curative pulmonary resection because of concern for age-related complications.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (ATP:3-phospho-D-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.3) is a metabolic enzyme functioning in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway that converts glucose (or fructose) to pyruvate. Two functional loci for the production of PGK have been identified in the mammalian genome. PGK-1 is an X-linked gene expressed constitutively in all somatic cells and premeitotic germ cells. The human PGK-1 gene consists of 11 exons and 10 introns encompassing a region approximately 23 kilobases (kb) in length. PGK-2 is an autosomal gene expressed in a tissue-specific manner exclusively in the late stages of spermatogenesis. In the present study, a molecular analysis of a human genomic clone of PGK-2 originally isolated by Szabo et al. has revealed that this autosomal sequence completely lacks introns and contains characteristics of a processed gene, or 'retroposon', including the remnants of a poly(A)+ tail and bounding direct repeats. Typically such processed sequences form non-functional pseudogenes that have evolved multiple genetic lesions which preclude translation of any transcript into a functional polypeptide. For example, an X-linked processed pseudogene of PGK-1 (psi PGK-1) in humans has been identified and shown to contain premature termination codons in all reading frames. It was therefore unexpected to find that the intronless autosomal PGK sequence reported here is not a pseudogene, but is rather a functional gene that has retained a complete open reading frame, and is actively expressed in mammalian spermatogenesis. Both the unusual conservation of function in this processed PGK-2 gene and its tissue-specific expression in spermatogenesis are best explained as a compensatory response to the inactivation of the X-linked PGK-1 gene in spermatogenic cells before meiosis.\r"

However, it may sometimes be difficult to obtain the necessary urine collections. Most of 19 healthy, reliable elderly outpatients were found unable to provide satisfactory 24-hour urine collections. To judge whether formulas estimating creatinine clearance from serum creatinine levels are reliable, we also compared 24-hour creatinine clearances measured in 50 inpatients with values calculated by the Cockroft-Gault equation. Only a moderate correlation was found, which may be unacceptable in the clinical situations for which the equation is used, such as drug dosing. For reasons including uncertainties in the validity of predictive formulas and unreliability of urine collections, we conclude that no acceptable method now exists for bedside estimation of glomerular filtration rate and that drug levels should be measured whenever possible in elderly patients and in those with renal insufficiency.\r"

At 37 degrees, the relaxation rate in the liver increased by 180%. This method is an attractive concept for the development of various organ-specific liposomal contrast agents that may be used for either MR imaging or nuclear medicine.\r"

The technique was validated by measuring duodenal recovery of 99mTc-HIDA (mean +/- SEM, 101% +/- 4%), and also by studying 2 subjects who had undergone cholecystectomy. During the first hour following an evening meal, cumulative GB ejection of 99mTc-HIDA in the 6 subjects with gallstones was 43% +/- 12%. This was accompanied by GB storage of most hepatic indocyanine green (70% +/- 5%) during each 10-min interval of that hour. During subsequent overnight fasting, storage of hepatic indocyanine green (89% +/- 2%) was accompanied by ejection of 99mTc-HIDA from the GB in 33 of the 66 hourly intervals. Since 'simultaneous' filling and emptying cannot occur through the cystic duct, the results suggest frequent alternations in absolute GB storage and emptying, a phenomenon more analogous to a bellows than to the conventional concept of a simple pump.\r"

We have studied 20 men and 13 women who had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia; 27 patients had an inv(16) and six patients had a t(16;16). Eight patients also had trisomy 22, and four had trisomy 8. All but two patients had the unique morphologic features of acute myelomonocytic leukemia with abnormal eosinophils (M4Eo). In one patient with M4 leukemia, abnormal eosinophils were not observed in the marrow. A second patient had acute monocytic leukemia, plus abnormal eosinophils. Eosinophils constituted 1% to 46% (median, 6%) of the bone marrow cells, and in all but a single patient, the eosinophils exhibited distinctly abnormal morphology. Twenty-five patients have had a complete remission (78% of treated patients). Nine patients have remained in remission longer than 24 months. No patient had symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease at diagnosis, and none had CNS leukemic mass lesions at any time. Treatment with high-dose cytarabine may have provided prophylactic CNS therapy. Four additional patients with chromosomal rearrangements involving a breakpoint at 16q22 but not at 16p13 have had different morphological features and different clinical courses. Thus, the juxtaposition of genes at 16p13 and 16q22, which occurs both in the inv(16) and the t(16;16), results in a specific subset of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia that has a favorable prognosis.\r"

The immunophenotype was compared with the French-American-British (FAB) classification obtained on the cases. The immunophenotype discriminated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and recognized cases not distinguished by cytochemistry (22% of cases), mixed lineage phenotypes (13% of cases), and cases with separate populations of lymphoblasts and myeloblasts (one case). Using the immunologic panel and derived criteria to subtype AML, correspondence of the immunophenotype to the FAB subtypes M1, M2, M4, and M5 was possible in greater than 80% of cases. A combined classification of the immunophenotype and FAB morphology/cytochemistry was devised for AML subtyping. It is recommended that immunophenotyping should be done at least in all cases with negative or inconclusive cytochemistry. At present, we suggest that until a \"gold standard\" for identifying leukemic subtypes is developed, the best method for typing acute leukemia is by using a combination of morphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping.\r"

Using in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that in accordance with observations in CML the Ph1 chromosome in ALL patients is the result of a consistent translocation of the c-abl oncogene to the Ph1 chromosome. Southern blot analysis using bcr probes, however, suggests that Ph1-positive ALL includes heterogeneous leukemic subtypes: six ALL patients showed bcr rearrangements as observed in CML; in three other patients recombination involving 5' bcr sequences could be demonstrated, but the corresponding translocated 3' bcr sequences were not detectable. A third group of five patients did not show any bcr rearrangements at all. Northern blot analysis using RNA from three Ph1-positive ALL patients revealed that in the leukemic cells of two patients larger c-abl mRNA transcripts were present, as in CML. In the RNA of one patient without a detectable bcr rearrangement, only the normal c-abl mRNA transcripts are present. The observed heterogeneity in bcr rearrangements of this group of Ph1-positive ALL patients is in contrast with the consistent results obtained in more than 50 Ph1-positive CML patients investigated in chronic and acute states.\r"

  ".W": "In order to test whether the ontogenetic origin of human parental cells influences the expression of globin genes, we did fusions of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells with fetal or adult nonerythroid cells and we assessed globin expression in hybrids. For selection of hybrid clones we used a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a human chromosome 11-linked cell surface marker. Globin expression was assessed with fluorescent antibody labeling, globin isoelectric focusing, and S1 nuclease mapping. Chromosome 11-containing hybrids from human nonerythroid cells (adult or fetal lymphoid cells; fetal fibroblasts) produced human adult (beta) but not fetal (gamma) globin chains. These results suggest that the MEL x nonerythroid cell hybrids express the adult human globin independent of whether the human cells derive from the fetal or from the adult stage of human development. Our findings, together with previous observations in MEL x fetal erythroid or MEL x HEL hybrids, show that the globin program of the parental human cell is the main determinant of the expression of fetal human globin in these hybrids.\r"

The peak age of onset was in the second decade. In the youngest generation, the proportion of affected to unaffected individuals at risk significantly differed from the expected 50%. There was slight slowing of conduction velocities in 36% of nerves; however, only 3 out of 10 affected members had entirely normal conduction studies. The amplitude of the sensory potentials of median and peroneal nerves was almost uniformly reduced. In all affected patients electromyography of anterior tibial muscles showed signs of neurogenic involvement. Histological study of two sural nerves and a sciatic nerve and its branches revealed loss of myelinated fibres with a proximal-to-distal gradient in this fibre loss, clusters of small regenerating fibres, and atrophic axons. Postmortem study of the proband showed loss of anterior horn and dorsal root ganglion neurons in the lumbar and sacral segments and degeneration of the fasciculus gracilis. Morphometric evaluation of L5 ventral and dorsal roots revealed a normal number of myelinated fibres, diameter histograms being shifted to the left because of a significant loss of large myelinated fibres and regeneration. These anatomical findings are consistent with the hypothesis that HMSN type II represents a primary neuronopathy affecting motor and sensory neurons.\r"

A total of 66 cases of seroconversion were documented among the 345 men between November 1982 and October 1985. Methods of survival data analysis that take into account the varying durations of follow-up were used to study the epidemiologic features of seroconversion in this group. The probability of seroconversion during the entire observation period was 23.1%. The seroconversion rates remained stable, at 10.5% and 10.0% during the last 2 years of the observation period. Cox regression analysis revealed the following variables to be independently associated with risk of seroconversion: frequent receptive anal intercourse, elevated number of male sexual partners in the year before enrolment, use of illicit drugs, a history of gonorrhea and age less than 30 years in November 1982. Multivariate analysis failed to reveal any role of oral sexual activity in the transmission of HIV. Oral ingestion of semen was not associated with seroconversion in either univariate or multivariate analysis. The observation that younger men were more likely to seroconvert suggests that young homosexual men were less likely than older men to modify their sexual behaviour.\r"

Analysis of the changes in these sensitive markers of renal tubular damage permitted detection of subclinical methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity. In the absence of cisplatin, methotrexate therapy was associated with significant but transient increases in each of the four markers. Irreversible nephrotoxicity, indicated by persistent rises in NAG and alanine aminopeptidase as well as increased serum creatinine levels, was associated with doses of methotrexate that followed the administration of cisplatin (400 mg/m2). The biphasic pattern of total protein and NAG excretion observed in all patients suggests more than one mechanism of methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity. Monitoring renal tubular damage in patients who are receiving methotrexate in combined-drug regimens would provide useful information for scheduling nephrotoxic drugs in clinical trials.\r"

Bone marrow and circulating blasts were large and showed prominent vacuolization, with variable degree of granular periodic acid-Schiff positivity in the cytoplasm. All patients had marked spleen and liver enlargement with cholestasis and without either lymph node or central nervous system disease. They achieved complete response to chemotherapy, and their median survival was longer than 12 months. Blast cells were studied for immunologic markers, propidium iodide flow cytofluorometric DNA content, and in vitro tritiated thymidine labeling index (3H-TdR LI). These showed a \"null\" phenotype in two cases, contained intracytoplasmic immunoglobulins (Cy mu) in two and were positive for CALL and Ia antigens in two others (one of which also contained Cy mu). Surface immunoglobulins (SIg) were found on less than 12% of cells, and T-cell markers were absent. In five cases, one or two stem lines with highly abnormal modal DNA content were found to coexist with diploid blasts. The 3H-TdR LI was high (8.5%-15.5%). Abnormal cell lines, after being cleared by chemotherapy, were found again at relapse. Additional cell lines appeared during the course of the disease in one patient, having different sensitivity to cytostatics. These cases of ALL apparently derive from B-cells not yet expressing SIg and have an exceptionally high incidence of aneuploid cell lines.\r"

Of these seven, four are alive with no evidence of disease 3.5 to 16 years after initial presentation; the remaining three patients died of their disease within 2 to 8 months of presentation. Two of 16 patients were diagnosed within the last 15 months and do not have adequate follow-up. The seven remaining patients developed acute leukemia within 1 week to 13 months of the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma. Six of them died 5 weeks to 16 months after diagnosis; one patient has been in complete remission for 8 years. Twelve of these 16 cases (75%) were initially misdiagnosed, most frequently as large cell lymphoma. The remaining four cases were correctly diagnosed as granulocytic sarcoma. The naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase stain was required to make the correct diagnosis in all cases. Contrary to findings in other series, granulocytic sarcoma arising in nonleukemic patients does not necessarily progress to acute leukemia. At least four of 16 (25%) patients in this series did not develop acute leukemia during the 3.5 to 16 years they have been followed. No prognostic factors were identified in this series to predict which patients would develop acute leukemia and which ones would not.\r"

Good correlation existed between peak concentrations and AUC (r = 0.866; P less than 0.001). In more than half of the cases there was evidence of prolonged elimination t1/2 or rebound of a serum concentration during the elimination phase corresponding to either an additional compartment or enterohepatic circulation of 6MP. One child did not achieve detectable concentrations on 2 different study days and was switched to a different protocol. The two children who had severe myelotoxicity achieved the largest AUC values per milligram per square meter of 6MP. Our results indicate that pharmacokinetic variability may contribute to either severe myelotoxicity or therapeutic failures. This suggests that monitoring of this drug in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be helpful.\r"

Cellular (nucleated blood and bone marrow cells) and plasma drug concentrations were studied. After bolus injection, peak plasma D-DNM concentrations were about 50 mg/ml. D-DNM plasma t1/2s were 0.4 +/- 0.3 hours (T1/2 alpha) and 16.4 +/- 4.7 hours (T1/2 beta). D-DNM concentrations in nucleated blood and bone marrow cells were on the same order of magnitude and amounted to more than 400 times the plasma concentration, whereas 4-demethoxydaunomycinol (D-DNMol) concentrations were about 200 times higher. Cellular D-DNM concentrations were maximal at the end of intravenous dosing and at 2 to 4 hours after D-DNM ingestion. D-DNMol concentrations increased more slowly and accumulated on subsequent treatment days in cells and plasma; D-DNM and D-DNMol cellular t1/2 times were 42 and 72 hours, respectively. Antileukemic activity was observed.\r"

We investigated the effect of a cell-permeable analog, 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), on CG alpha- and beta-subunit gene expression in the JEG-3 placental cell line. RNA blot hybridization analysis demonstrated that 8-Br-cAMP increased CG alpha and beta mRNA levels 15- to 30-fold, consistent with 8-Br-cAMP regulation of CG biosynthesis at a pretranslational level. Transcription rates for CG alpha- and beta-subunit genes were determined in the absence and presence of 8-Br-cAMP using nuclear run-on assays. The basal transcription rates for the alpha- and beta-subunit genes were similar and increased 4- to 6-fold after treatment with 8-Br-cAMP. Expression of chimeric genes, consisting of alpha gene [1.5 kilobase (Kb)] or CG beta gene (0.3 Kb) 5'-flanking sequences ligated to the coding sequence of a reporter enzyme chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), was used to analyze the mechanism of 8-Br-cAMP stimulation of gene transcription. A 1.5-kb segment of the alpha- gene 5'-flanking sequence was expressed efficiently in JEG-3 cells and contains both cell-specific enhancers and cAMP response elements. Basal expression of the CG beta CAT reporter gene was not observed in either JEG-3 cells or HeLa cells, and expression was not stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP. The regulatory response elements of the CG beta gene must reside in sequences outside the 0.3-kb 5'-flanking region of the CG beta gene.\r"

  ".W": "Oxytocin, oxytocin-associated neurophysin (neurophysin), prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and progesterone concentrations were measured in the utero-ovarian vein (UOV) of sheep during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy. On days 13-16 of the cycle, large pulses of PGF2 alpha, oxytocin, and neurophysin were measured in samples collected at hourly intervals from the UOV draining a corpus luteum (UOV/CL). Most of the PGF2 alpha pulses (96.5%) coincided with a pulse of both oxytocin and neurophysin, whereas only 55.6% of oxytocin pulses coincided with a pulse of PGF2 alpha. Therefore, during luteolysis in sheep, uterine PGF2 alpha release is closely associated with ovarian oxytocin release, and oxytocin release is unlikely to be dependent upon a uterine PGF2 alpha stimulus. During frequent sampling, coincident oxytocin pulses were measured in 1) both UOVs when a CL was present in both ovaries and 2) the jugular vein, carotid artery, and UOV/CL, with a significantly higher oxytocin pulse concentration occurring in jugular venous compared with carotid arterial plasma. Pituitary and luteal release of oxytocin may, therefore, occur simultaneously and be controlled by a circulating factor in sheep. Compared to days 13-16 of the cycle, significantly (P less than 0.001) fewer pulses of PGF2 alpha, which were significantly (P less than 0.001) smaller in amplitude, were measured in UOV samples collected frequently during early pregnancy. The frequency of oxytocin pulses observed in the UOV/CL of pregnant sheep was not significantly (P greater than 0.1) different from that observed in cyclic ewes, although most (86.4%) oxytocin pulses occurred in the absence of a PGF2 alpha pulse. In contrast, when a pulse of PGF2 alpha was observed in the UOV/CL of pregnant ewes, it usually coincided with a pulse of oxytocin. The suppression of uterine PGF2 alpha release during early pregnancy is not considered to result from a lack of stimulation by oxytocin.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of prostaglandin (PG) release in vitro, but they fail to influence basal PG production in vivo. To test one possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy in the present study we investigated the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on basal and antidiuretic hormone-stimulated renal PG synthesis in vivo. In long term experiments, Brattleboro diabetes insipidus rats were treated with DEX (250 micrograms kg-1 day-1) for 7 days, and the effects of deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin were investigated on the fifth day of DEX treatment. Administration of deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin was accompanied by a marked increase in PGE2 and PGF2 alpha excretion in both control and DEX-treated animals, but the response was significantly higher during DEX treatment. Furthermore, DEX, by itself, caused a significant increase in the excretion of both PGs. In short term experiments, diabetes insipidus rats received a 24-h iv infusion of DEX (1 mg kg-1 day-1), then renal PG synthesis was stimulated acutely by the infusion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) for 40 min. DEX treatment failed to inhibit basal PG excretion, and the AVP-induced enhancement of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha production was also identical in control and DEX-treated animals. DEX was ineffective in altering the hydroosmotic effect of AVP, confirming that intrarenal PG synthesis was not inhibited. We conclude that glucocorticoids in vivo do not inhibit anti-diuretic hormone-stimulated PG production, and thus, a differential effect of glucocorticoids on basal vs. stimulated PG synthesis cannot account for the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro studies.\r"

Stimulation of PGE2 synthesis was significant at 50 ng/ml (1.2 X 10(-8) M) hPTH-(1-34) and was dose dependent at concentrations up to 0.6 microgram/ml (1.4 X 10(-7) M). Continuous exposure of calvariae to hPTH-(1-34) showed that PGE2 production increased significantly by 1 h, reached a maximum at 24 h, and then persisted over 96 h. Indomethacin at concentrations above 5 X 10(-7) M inhibited PGE2 synthesis by both control and hPTH-(1-34)-treated bones. PTH-(1-34) stimulated bone cells to convert arachidonic acid to PGE2, but did not activate the bone to release stored arachidonate. In summary, our results show that hPTH-(1-34) stimulates PGE2 synthesis by chick calvariae. This endogenous PGE2 may be involved in bone remodeling.\r"

Higher mean CA-125 values also were observed in acute pelvic inflammatory disease, unexplained fertility, and pregnancy and during menstruation. The mean CA-125 value in women with treated endometriosis and a negative second-look laparoscopy was significantly lower than in women with untreated endometriosis. With the use of the 95% upper limit of 16 U/ml, the test had a sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 93%. The frequencies of elevated levels in minimal, mild, moderate, and severe endometriosis were 27%, 68%, 73%, and 100%, respectively. Changes in the CA-125 levels correlated with the clinical course of endometriosis in 37 of 44 (84%) women (P less than 0.001). The determination of CA-125 levels may assist in the evaluation and treatment of women with endometriosis.\r"

To determine the relationship of inflammation to the in vivo production of leukotrienes, rabbit colitis was induced by formalin enema followed by intravenous infusion of immune complexes, and serial samples were collected by rectal dialysis. Leukotrienes B4 and C4 were measured by radioimmunoassay after high-pressure liquid chromatography. Prostaglandin E2 was assayed after Sephadex chromatography. Leukotrienes were not detected in control animals. Eicosanoid production progressively increased during development of inflammation and correlated with severity of inflammatory cell infiltration (p less than 0.01). Methylprednisolone decreased prostaglandin E2 but did not significantly reduce leukotrienes or inflammation. These data demonstrate that in vivo production of leukotrienes B4 and C4 correlates with indices of inflammation, consistent with the concept that these eicosanoids contribute to the inflammation of colitis.\r"

Concentrations were abnormally high (greater than 40 U/ml) in 57 (90%) patients with cancer and only in 5 (10%) patients with chronic pancreatitis. All patients with falsely normal serum values had poorly differentiated carcinomas. Median CA 19-9 concentrations were progressively higher in patients with more advanced cancer. Fifteen of 16 (93%) patients with localized cancer has abnormal serum levels but only 5 (31%) of them had values greater than 120 U/ml, which was the highest score observed in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Pure pancreatic juice was obtained endoscopically from 23 patients with pancreatic cancer and from 20 with chronic pancreatitis. CA 19-9 concentrations in pancreatic juice were significantly higher in patients with cancer than in non-neoplastic patients. All 11 patients with resectable cancer investigated had a ratio of CA 19-9 to secretory protein concentration in pancreatic juice above the range of patients with chronic pancreatitis. We conclude that serum CA 19-9 determination is highly sensitive and specific for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer versus chronic pancreatitis. However, moderately increased values (less than 120 U/ml), as seen in patients with localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma, are not conclusive for malignancy. The measurement of CA 19-9 to total protein ratio in pure pancreatic juice is proposed as an adjunctive, accurate diagnostic marker for early stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective multi-institutional study of 227 patients with osteosarcoma of the distal end of the femur was done to compare rates of local recurrence, metastasis, and survival. Three cohorts of patients who had had either a limb-sparing procedure, an above-the-knee amputation, or disarticulation of the hip were compared. The results revealed prevalences of eight of seventy-three, nine of 115, and zero of thirty-nine as to local recurrence; forty-three of seventy-three, sixty-five of 115, and twenty-one of thirty-nine as to metastasis; and thirty-three of seventy-three, forty-eight of 115, and eighteen of thirty-nine as to death. Of the seventeen patients who had a local recurrence, sixteen died. In the limb-salvage group, eighteen patients required amputation, because of local recurrence in eight and other local complications in ten. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the percentage of patients who survived and the percentage of patients without recurrent disease showed no difference among the three surgical groups (Mantel-Cox test statistic: p = 0.8) after a median length of follow-up of five and one-half years. Various covariant adjusted estimates yielded similar results. For the entire group of patients, the rate of continuously disease-free survival was 42 per cent, and the over-all rate of survival was 55 per cent at five years. It appears that, compared with above-the-knee amputation or disarticulation of the hip, the use of a limb-salvage procedure for osteosarcoma of the distal end of the femur did not shorten the disease-free interval or compromise long-term survival.\r"

Since in acromegaly there is increased collagen production, we measured serum PIIIP in acromegalic patients before any treatment (basal), during medical treatment with the somatostatin analog SMS 201-995, and after pituitary adenomectomy. In all patients, serum GH and plasma somatomedin-C (SmC) levels were also measured. Basal serum PIIIP levels were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher in acromegalic patients (mean +/- SEM, 22.7 +/- 2.1 ng/ml) than in normal subjects (n = 30; 9.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml), and they were significantly correlated with plasma SmC values (r = 0.31; P less than 0.05). A significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in PIIIP levels occurred in patients treated with SMS 201-995 or surgery (from 24.3 +/- 2.7 to 12.4 +/- 1 ng/ml) as well as in GH and SmC levels. The maximum percent decrease in serum PIIIP was significantly correlated with those in GH (r = 0.65; P less than 0.01) and SmC (r = 0.60; P less than 0.01). Serum PIIIP levels did not change in those patients in whom neither GH nor SmC were decreased by treatment. In conclusion, serum PIIIP levels are elevated in acromegalic patients, and they decline in parallel with GH and SmC during medical or surgical treatment. Serum PIIIP measurements may be useful in the evaluation of acromegalic patients to gain information on the biological activity of GH and in monitoring the course of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "SMS 201-995 (SMS) is a long-acting analog of somatostatin. We studied the effect of SMS (50-100 micrograms, sc, every 8 h) on serum GH in five patients with acromegaly. Serum GH decreased significantly in four of the five patients 4 h after SMS treatment. In two of the four patients, this reduction was not sustained for 7 h, but sustained reduction to normal GH concentrations did occur in the two patients who had basal serum GH levels below 15 ng/ml. In the two patients whose responses were not sustained for 7 h, a higher dose of SMS did not cause sustained reduction in GH. SMS was well tolerated, except for one episode of elevated serum aminotransferase levels. These results indicate that SMS-induced reductions in serum GH in patients with acromegaly are often not sustained despite SMS administration every 8 h and indicate that the insufficient duration of effect may limit its therapeutic efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that human leukemic cells proliferate normally in serum-free media containing various transferrin forms, but the addition of transferrin-gallium leads to inhibition of cellular proliferation. Because gallium has therapeutic potential, the effects of transferrin-gallium on leukemic cell proliferation, transferrin receptor expression, and cellular iron utilization were studied. The cytotoxicity of gallium is considerably enhanced by its binding to transferrin and cytotoxicity can be reversed by transferrin-iron but not by other transferrin forms. Exposure to transferrin-gallium leads to a marked increase in cell surface transferrin binding sites, but despite this, cellular 59Fe incorporation is inappropriately low. Although shunting of transferrin-gallium to another cellular compartment has not been ruled out, other studies suggest that transferrin-gallium impairs intracellular release of 59Fe from transferrin by interfering with processes responsible for intracellular acidification. These studies, taken together, demonstrate that inhibition of cellular iron incorporation by transferrin-gallium is a prerequisite for inhibition of cellular proliferation.\r"

The clonogenic growth of fresh acute myeloid leukemia cells was inhibited by 50% at approximately 15 pM rTNF. The growth of normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) was also inhibited (by 50 pM rTNF), as was the growth of erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) (by 150 pM rTNF). A synergistic antiproliferative effect was demonstrated between rTNF and recombinant interferon-gamma. Use of radioiodinated rTNF enabled us to detect 1,500-2,100 binding sites on myeloid cell lines at 4 degrees C with Kd of approximately 300 pM. At 37 degrees C, the transfer of bound ligand to lysosomes was followed by degradation, inhibited by NH4+. No correlation was observed between the number of binding sites or affinity at 4 degrees C and antiproliferative response to the addition of rTNF.\r"

It was reasoned that the increased vascularity associated with inflamed tissue may result in measurable increases in surface temperature. One subject with normal oral mucosa and three subjects with oral lesions of varying causes were studied with a thermal video system, using an infrared imager and microprocessor. A clinical photograph of each subject was obtained. Multiple thermograms were made in a temperature range of 30.0 C to 34.2 C at a sensitivity of 0.2 C. Photographs were taken on different occasions to determine whether the temperature readings could be duplicated and to test the accuracy of each reading. The normal surface temperature of the control subject's mucosa was significantly cooler than were the temperatures of the inflamed areas in the subjects with lesions induced by chemotherapy. The temperature of the areas of stomatitis was consistent (subject 3, mean = 33.7 C; subject 4, mean = 33.9 C). The necrotic center of a traumatic ulcer inhibited measurement of an underlying inflamed base and, thus, was equivalent to the control in temperature (subject 1 (control), mean = 31.9 C; subject 2 (necrotic lesion), mean = 31.7 C). These results suggest that infrared thermography may provide a means to quantitatively assess the degree of mucosal inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of IJ antigens in maintenance of the tolerant state in adult H-2 tolerant mice, we have attempted to abolish tolerance by injecting monoclonal antibodies (mab) specific for host, donor, or third party IJ antigens into adult H-2 tolerant mice. Abolition of tolerance was evidenced by the rejection of fresh test skin grafts bearing the tolerated antigens. Whole H-2 tolerant mice treated with anti-IJ mab specific for donor (allo) IJ antigens rejected their test skin grafts, indicating that tolerance had been abolished. When two other types of tolerant mice were tested, we found that mice tolerant of class II antigens alone, but not mice tolerant of an IJ thru D disparity, were susceptible to the anti-donor IJ mab treatment. In addition, adult tolerant mice were unaffected by treatment with either anti-host or anti-third party IJ mab. When tested in vitro, lymphoid cells from tolerant mice, the tolerance of which was abolished by anti-IJ mab, remained unresponsive to the tolerogen, just as untreated (control) tolerant mice, in several in vitro assays (e.g., mixed lymphocyte reaction, cytotoxic T cell precursor frequency and bulk cell-mediated lysis without growth factor). Mice treated with antidonor IJ mab, however, unlike mice treated with anti-host or third party IJ mab, were capable of generating tolerogen-specific T cells in the absence of exogenous growth factor. Thus in the strain combinations we used, adult mice tolerant of either the entire H-2 region or of the class II major histocompatibility complex region alone are susceptible to abolition of the tolerant state by treatment with anti-donor IJ mab. Coincidentally, lymphoid cells from these mice generate sufficient endogenous T helper activity to activate the tolerogen-specific cytotoxic T cells. We suspect that these latter cells may be responsible for rejection of grafts bearing the tolerated antigens.\r"

  ".W": "Whether cimetidine protects gastric mucosal cells independently of its antisecretory effect has been controversial. Some investigators postulate that, on the contrary, cimetidine decreases the integrity of gastric mucosa. Furthermore, whether cimetidine influences gastric prostaglandin (PG) synthesis is debated. Therefore, we investigated and compared with 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 (dmPGE2) whether cimetidine protects cultured rat gastric mucosal cells from indomethacin, and tested whether cimetidine affects gastric PG production by these cells. Cell damage was assessed by chromium 51-release assay. Concentrations of indomethacin greater than 1 mmol/L caused cell damage and increased 51Cr release in a dose-dependent and time-dependent fashion. dmPGE2 significantly reduced indomethacin-induced increase of 51Cr release, whereas cimetidine at both nonantisecretory and antisecretory doses did not alter 51Cr release caused by indomethacin. The cultured cells released PGE2 and PGI2 in amounts of 215 +/-18 and 56 +/- 3 (mean +/- SEM) pg/10(5) cells in 1 hour, respectively. Nondamaging concentrations of indomethacin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PG release from cultured cells with 50% inhibitory concentration at a dose of 10(-6) to 10(-7) mol/L. Cimetidine did not alter gastric PG production. In summary, exogenous PG protected gastric mucosal cells from indomethacin in vitro, but cimetidine did not. In conclusion, cimetidine, which fails to affect gastric PG production, does not directly influence the integrity of gastric mucosal cells.\r"

Forty-two patients (82.4%) achieved complete remission (CR). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a probability for remaining in remission of 14% and for survival of 23% at 6 years. Pretreatment factors related to the achievement of CR, such as age, French-American-British (FAB) classification and WBC at the start of treatment, were not identified. Factors related to the CR duration and survival time of the patients who had achieved CR were first analyzed by a univariate analysis with the generalized Wilcoxon test. WBC count at the start of treatment, percent of blasts in the marrow at 1 and 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy, days required until CR, number of courses of induction therapy required until CR, and days required for the disappearance of circulating blasts were identified as statistically significant prognostic factors. When these characteristics were further analyzed by the Cox multivariate regression model, the percent of blasts in the bone marrow at 2 weeks was the most important prognostic factor with a statistical significance, and WBC count at the start of treatment and days required until CR (or number of courses required to achieve CR) were also important factors, with borderline significance.\r"

Radioactivity in the abscesses was determined 48 hr postinjection. Accumulation of [111In]N was inversely proportional to abscess age. Seven-day-old abscesses were inconsistently seen on [111In]N scans. In contrast, 67Ga accumulation was not affected by abscess age and all abscesses could be identified on a scan 48 hr postinjection. Scans with [111In]N were clearly superior to 67Ga scans for demonstrating early abscesses. Since 67Ga accumulated to a greater extent than [111In]N in abscesses 7 days old, it may be a superior imaging agent for older abscesses.\r"

Segment stability was also evaluated and correlated with measured densities. In both experimental groups, clinical stability occurred at about the same time (45.7 and 48.7 days postoperatively) despite large differences in the size of the initial surgical defects. The net rate (slope) of osteotomy site remineralization was significantly different (Group II greater than Group I), but the relative difference in film absorbance between the osteotomy site and adjacent bone at the time of clinical stability was the same. This difference can be extrapolated from early postoperative films and may constitute a useful parameter for predicting when clinical stability will be achieved.\r"

Medical, administrative, and manual workers had similar seroprevalence (6.5%, 6.4%, and 6.0%, respectively), and seropositivity was not associated with any measure of patient, blood, or needle contact.

  ".W": "The sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, LTC4 and LTD4, have vasoconstrictor effects in the kidney, reducing both renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate. As one mechanism regulating the glomerular filtration rate, mesangial cell contraction may reduce the capillary surface area, thereby lowering the ultrafiltration coefficient. Using image analysis microscopy to quantify changes in cell morphology, we found that LTC4 and LTD4 (1 X 10(-12)M to 1 X 10(-6)M) reduced the cross-sectional area of cultured mesangial cells from rat glomeruli. The response to LTC4 and LTD4 (10(-6)M), as measured by the percentage of responding cells (30 to 35%), the maximum decrease in cross-sectional area (25 to 32%), and the time course was identical to that for angiotensin II (10(-6)M). The contraction induced by LTD4 was attenuated by an LTD4 receptor antagonist (4R,5S,6Z-nor-LTD1). Also, preincubation with colchicine prevented LTC4-induced contraction. Leukotriene B4, a non-sulfidopeptide leukotriene that stimulates chemotaxis and chemokinesis, had negligible agonist activity. Mesangial cells cultured on less adhesive teflon membranes were more responsive to LTD4 (62% of cells responded) than cells cultured on glass or polystyrene (35% of cells responded). Mesangial cell contraction was not merely a shape-change as a result of cell damage, since cellular injury was not documented by lactate dehydrogenase release and proliferation of mesangial cells was not retarded by LTC4. Furthermore, the contraction was independent of cell size. Because leukotrienes stimulate cyclooxygenase products in other cells, we examined the ability of the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes to stimulate prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. LTC4 and LTD4 did not stimulate PGE2 formation, the major cyclooxygenase product of rat mesangial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These two processes, used together, make the likelihood of a common event happening seem very improbable.

During a four-month period, we observed 3 cases of ET that had transformed into leukemia. Two patients had been treated with uracil mustard: One developed acute myelogenous leukemia 79 months after institution of therapy, and the other patient developed chronic myelomonocytic leukemia 24 months after the start of therapy. The third patient had been treated with busulfan, and ET evolved into myelofibrosis and eventually into acute undifferentiated leukemia with myelofibrosis. The patient who developed acute myelogenous leukemia was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of ET but was treated because his platelet count was greater than 1,000,000/mm3. He died 1 month after leukemic transformation, during induction chemotherapy. The other 2 patients presented with symptoms referable to their thrombocythemia. Review of the English literature revealed 12 other definite or probable cases of ET with leukemic transformation, all but 1 having been treated with alkylating agents and/or 32P. We propose that the natural history of ET may be similar to that of polycythemia vera, with evolution into leukemia being an unusual occurrence except in the setting of previous chemotherapy. Therefore, the current practice of treating asymptomatic patients with ET may not be justified, since administration of alkylating agents or 32P may increase the risk of subsequent development of leukemia.\r"

We then treated eight additional patients in the blast phase of chronic granulocytic leukemia with a combination of alternate-day plicamycin and daily hydroxyurea. All six patients with myeloid morphology at the time of blast crisis responded with a return to a chronic phase without an intervening pancytopenic period. Of three patients with lymphoid morphology at the time of treatment, only one responded (this patient had recently relapsed and converted from myeloid to lymphoid morphology). Another patient with nonmyeloid, nonlymphoid blast morphology also did not respond. Continual therapy with the two-drug combination appeared to be necessary, since early relapses were seen in responding patients whose therapy was interrupted. These data are preliminary and will need further confirmation, but they suggest that the combination of alternate-day plicamycin and daily hydroxyurea may be effective in the myeloid blast phase of chronic granulocytic leukemia.\r"

Existing guidelines for reducing exposure to blood and other body fluids will protect workers who care for patients infected with this pathogen. New infection-control guidelines for patients with AIDS are therefore not required. Awareness of the potential for nosocomial transmission of HIV has resulted in a renewed respect for the principles and practice of infection control. The procedures that the task force recommended to prevent contact with body fluids will reduce exposure not only to HIV but also to other potentially contagious pathogens in the health care environment. Implementation and enforcement of these guidelines for all patients could greatly reduce the incidence of nosocomial and occupationally acquired infections.\r"

  ".W": "In a cohort of 1835 homosexual men who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on entry into a prospective study, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed in 59 during a median follow-up of 15 months. We matched 5 seropositive controls to each case according to study center and date of enrollment and performed a case-control analysis to determine factors predictive of AIDS. In a multivariate analysis, a decreased number of T helper lymphocytes, an increased number of T suppressor lymphocytes, a low level of antibody to HIV, a high titer of cytomegalovirus antibody, and a history of sex with someone in whom AIDS developed were independently associated with subsequent AIDS. Separate analyses of risk factors for Kaposi's sarcoma and opportunistic infections failed to support previously reported associations between the use of nitrites or an elevated cytomegalovirus-antibody titer and Kaposi's sarcoma. These variables may be markers rather than determinants of disease progression. A vigorous antibody response to HIV infection may confer at least temporary protection against the progression of immunodeficiency to AIDS, or a low level of antibody to HIV may reflect a later stage of infection. The increased risk associated with a history of sex with someone in whom AIDS developed may indicate earlier infection in cases or infection with a more virulent strain of HIV. These results may be useful in counseling HIV-seropositive persons and in designing studies of clinical interventions.\r"

It is postulated that they act through activation of protein kinase C, but substantial heterogeneity in their pharmacological and binding behaviour in some systems has caused concern about whether this is their only target. Evidence linking protein kinase C activation with biological responses to the phorbol esters includes similarity in structure-activity relations for binding and response; in vitro phosphorylation of specific proteins by protein kinase C at the same sites at which phorbol ester treatment induces phosphorylation in intact cells; and correlation in certain cell types between down regulation of protein kinase C on chronic phorbol ester treatment and loss of cellular responsiveness to the phorbol ester. Here we report that microinjection of purified protein kinase C into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts pretreated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) restores the mitogenic response of the cells to PDBu, directly establishing the involvement of protein kinase C in this response.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1, HTLV-III/LAV), the retrovirus responsible for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), shows a high degree of genetic polymorphism, particularly in the env gene. We have examined sera from rabbits and guinea pigs immunized with gp130, a recombinant env glycoprotein, and sera from HIV-1-infected subjects, to test their capacity to neutralize a panel of genetically divergent HIV-1 isolates. The sera raised against recombinant antigen specifically neutralized the virus strain from which the env gene was cloned (HTLV-IIIB), but not an independent isolate (HTLV-IIIRF). One rabbit serum tested on seven isolates cross-neutralized two at lower titres. In contrast, human sera from Britain and Uganda, chosen for ability to neutralize HTLV-IIIRF, cross-neutralized six other HIV-1 isolates. When serum and isolate were derived from the same subject, the serum was in some cases effective at slightly lower concentrations (higher titres). Human complement did not affect neutralization titres. These findings indicate that genetically diverse HIV-1 isolates carry both variable and widely conserved antigenic epitopes for neutralizing antibodies. The identification of shared epitopes may help the development of protective vaccines.\r"

To test one aspect of this hypothesis--the effect of changes in condylar orientation--one condyle in each of thirty-five young male rats was rotated surgically, either clockwise or counterclockwise, and then wired to the ramus to preserve the new orientation. Amalgam implants and lateral cephalograms were used to measure the subsequent pattern of mandibular growth. The findings revealed that surgical rotation of the condyle and the subsequent pattern of mandibular displacement are poorly correlated (r = 0.1-0.3). It was concluded, therefore, that changes in the pattern of mandibular rotation that may follow early mandibular advancement are the result of factors other than the orientation of the condyle following surgery.\r"

True antral mucoceles are potentially destructive lesions that are often secondary to trauma, especially the Caldwell-Luc procedure. This article describes in some detail the clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of true antral mucoceles. One type of antral mucocele, commonly seen in Japan, is referred to as a postoperative maxillary cyst and is identical to the surgical ciliated cyst of the maxilla originally reported by Gregory and Shafer.\r"

Most of the patients were in their 20s and 30s at the time of diagnosis, and the postoperative duration was between 10 and 49 years. Radiographically, most cases revealed a unilocular cystic lesion. In two thirds of the cases, the lesion occupied more than half the volume of the maxillary sinus while the remaining one third of the cases revealed more limited lesions of the sinus. Histopathologically, cuboidal, squamous, and mixed epithelial cyst linings were observed, although the basic epithelial lining was the ciliated columnar type. Epithelial dysplasia was found in two cases. The cysts near the nasal cavity may originate from regenerated nasal mucosa, and the cysts that are located at a distance from the nasal cavity may be lined with epithelium derived from residual mucosa of the sinus entrapped during surgery to relieve sinusitis.\r"

Subjectively, the observers favored radiographs produced with lower beam energies; 90 kVp aluminum filtration and 3.5 mm was least popular, and 70 kVp with 2.5 mm aluminum was most popular. Objectively, there was little difference in the success of identification between the beams of different energies. Masking of radiographs improved success apart from the low density zones in less exposed radiographs. Little evidence has been found within the range investigated for selecting one beam quality over another, other than subjective preference. However, low beam energies should be avoided because of reduced emulsion sensitivity.\r"

One of the cDNA clones isolated from a rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) phage lambda gt11 library had a 1473-base-pair-long insert that encoded a protein with 317 amino acid residues. This cDNA clone appears to represent the complete coding region of sialoprotein mRNA, including a putative AUG initiation codon and a signal peptide sequence. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA contains several Ser-Xaa-Glu sequences, possibly representing attachment points for O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides and one Asn-Xaa-Ser sequence representing a likely site for the N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide. An interesting observation is the Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser sequence, which is identical to the cell-binding sequence identified in fibronectin. The presence of this sequence prompted us to investigate the cell-binding properties of sialoprotein. The ROS 17/2.8 cells attached and attained a spread morphology on surfaces coated with sialoprotein. We could demonstrate that synthetic Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides efficiently inhibited the attachment of cells to sialoprotein-coated substrates. The results show that the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence also confers cell-binding properties on bone-specific sialoprotein. To better reflect the potential function of bone sialoprotein--we propose the name \"osteopontin\" for this protein.\r"

  ".U": "87067406\r", 
  ".W": "Neurohypophysial hormones stimulate the motility of tunica albuginea, epididymis, and vas deferens acting through oxytocin (OT) and V1 vasopressin receptors. To test the hypothesis that these hormones are involved also in the regulation of seminal vesicle physiology, we studied binding of [3H]OT and [3H] arginine vasopressin ([3H]AVP) to porcine seminal vesicle membranes. Neurohypophysial hormones bind to two different classes of sites. The first class shows low capacity (35 fmol per mg of protein) and a very high affinity (Kd less than 1 nM) for both the labeled ligands. The second class is characterized by a high capacity (2000 fmol per mg of protein) and a high affinity for AVP (Kd approximately equal to 2.5 nM), whereas OT has 160 times lower affinity. Lysine vasopressin and the V1 antagonist [1-deaminopenicillamine, 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine]Arg8-vasopressin compete with high affinity with [3H]AVP binding, whereas the V2 agonist [1-deamino,4-valine]D-Arg8-vasopressin (dVDAVP) is 110 times less potent than AVP. The OT agonist [Thr4,Gly7]OT and the OT antagonist [1(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid), 2-(O-ethyl)tyrosine, 8-ornithine]vasotocin failed to affect [3H]AVP binding. These findings seem to suggest that AVP interacts with the V1 vasopressin isoreceptor in porcine seminal vesicle membranes. However, AVP stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-dependent fashion with an EC50 of 14 nM, whereas OT or dVDAVP has no effect at 100 nM. Moreover, a well-characterized V1 vasopressin antagonist, [1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid),2-(O-methyl)tyrosine]Arg8-vasopressin [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP], competes with [3H]AVP binding with an IC50 of 0.17 microM. These pharmacological properties are distinct from the previously described V1 and V2 vasopressin receptors and indicate the presence of a new class of AVP receptors. Although this vasopressin isoreceptor shares some pharmacological characteristics with the V1 (pressor) isoreceptor, it has low affinity for the V1 antagonist d(CH2)5-Tyr(Me)AVP and is linked to the adenylate cyclase system. The extremely high density of AVP receptors in porcine seminal vesicles (2 pmol per mg of protein) is comparable to the density of V2 vasopressin receptors in porcine renal medulla, suggesting a physiological role for vasopressin in the seminal vesicle.\r"

These enriched binding elements exhibited markedly enhanced PR binding on a per mass DNA basis compared to chromatin (20- to 25-fold) or dehistonized chromatin (4- to 5-fold). Electrophoretic analysis of the nuclease-resistant DNA showed that there is a set of DNA fragments of 100-150 base pairs that are protected from digestion. Excessive digestion resulted in smaller DNA fragments and a loss of PR binding activity. The PR binding was saturable using a crude receptor preparation and displayed a competition with the same receptor preparation that was labeled with nonradioactive progesterone. The enhanced binding was also demonstrable using highly purified receptor preparations that exhibit two classes of binding sites both of which are of high affinity and saturable as assessed by Scatchard analyses. These two high-affinity classes of binding sites are shown to be competed by unlabeled purified PR. The nuclease resistance of these nucleoprotein acceptor sites from chromatin is a property similar to the nuclear matrix binding sites suggesting a relationship between these two classes of nuclear acceptor sites.\r"

The gene was cloned by cDNA synthesis with a laccase-specific synthetic deoxyundecanucleotide as primer and poly(A) RNA isolated from cycloheximide-treated N. crassa cultures as template. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA obtained, a unique 21-mer was synthesized and used to screen a genomic DNA library from N. crassa. Five different positive clones were isolated and shown to share an overlapping DNA region with the same pattern of restriction sites. Sequence analysis of the common 1.36-kilobase Sal I fragment revealed an open reading frame of 726 nucleotides. The amino acid sequence deduced is in complete agreement with the primary structures of several tryptic peptides isolated previously from N. crassa laccase. The analyzed carboxyl-terminal region of laccase exhibits a striking sequence homology to the carboxyl-terminal part of the third homology unit of the multicopper oxidase ceruloplasmin and to a smaller extent, to the low molecular weight blue copper proteins plastocyanin and azurin. Based on amino acid sequence comparison between these proteins, putative copper ligands of N. crassa laccase are proposed. Moreover, these data further support the hypothesis that the small blue copper proteins and the multicopper oxidases have evolved from the same ancestral gene.\r"

The biological activity of the expressed NS protein was demonstrated by in vitro synthesis of mRNA by transcription-reconstitution with purified viral L protein and N-RNA template. Deletion mapping of the NS gene defined a specific domain between amino acid residues 213 and 247, which was essential for in vitro transcription. Removal of the COOH-terminal 21 amino acids, on the other hand, did not have a significant effect on transcription. This domain appears to be involved in efficient binding of NS protein to the N protein-RNA template.\r"

We quantitated repair in specific restriction fragments by using the dimer-specific bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V and analysis by Southern blotting. Within 4 hr after 5- or 10-J/m2 UV irradiation, more than 60% of the dimers had been removed from a 20-kilobase fragment that lies entirely within the transcription unit of the DHFR gene and from a 25-kilobase fragment located in the 5' flanking region of the gene. Repair in the overall genome was measured by analyzing cellular DNA treated with T4 endonuclease V in alkaline sucrose gradients. Sixty-nine percent of the dimers were removed from the genome overall within 24 hr after irradiation, but only 25% were removed within 4 hr and 38% were removed within 8 hr. These results demonstrate a strong preferential rate of removal of dimers from the 50-kilobase region that includes the transcriptionally active DHFR gene compared to that in total cellular DNA. We confirmed that DHFR-containing DNA is repaired more rapidly than bulk DNA by using an approach that provides a direct comparison between repair in specific sequences and repair in total cellular DNA. We also show that the DHFR-containing sequences are repaired more rapidly than the nontranscribed repetitive alpha DNA sequences. Our finding of preferential early repair in a transcriptionally active region in overall repair-proficient cells suggests that selective dimer removal from active sequences may be a general characteristic of mammalian DNA repair.\r"

Glucocorticoid-stimulated genes have been especially useful in unraveling molecular events responsible for positive gene regulation in mammals. The gene encoding proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which is under feedback inhibition by glucocorticoids, provides a model system to study negative gene regulation. Using an episomal bovine papilloma virus vector, we now demonstrate that a 769-base-pair fragment containing the rat POMC promoter is sufficient to confer glucocorticoid inhibition. Transcription from the episomal POMC promoter starts at the same site and is inhibited by glucocorticoids to the same extent as POMC transcription in the anterior pituitary. Glucocorticoid inhibition is specific for POMC transcripts; neither bovine papilloma virus nor cellular actin mRNAs are affected by glucocorticoids. Thus, the episomal bovine papilloma virus/POMC system can be used to study the relationship between negative regulation of POMC transcription and chromatin structure.\r"

It catalyzes the formation of the intermediary glycols of norepinephrine metabolism, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol, from the corresponding aldehydes 3,4-dihydroxymandelaldehyde and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelaldehyde with Km values of 55 and 120 microM and kcat/Km ratios of 14,000 and 17,000 mM-1 X min-1; these are from 60- to 210-fold higher than those obtained with class I ADH isozymes. The catalytic preference of class II ADH also extends to benzaldehydes. The kcat/Km values for the reduction of benzaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde by pi ADH are from 9- to 29-fold higher than those for a class I isozyme, beta 1 gamma 2 ADH. Furthermore, the norepinephrine aldehydes are potent inhibitors of alcohol (ethanol) oxidation by pi ADH. The high catalytic activity of pi ADH-catalyzed reduction of the aldehydes in combination with a possible regulatory function of the aldehydes in the oxidative direction leads to essentially \"unidirectional\" catalysis by pi ADH. These features and the presence of pi ADH in human liver imply a physiological role for pi ADH in the degradation of circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine.\r"

Cisplatin (10 microM) and 5FUra (5 microM) in combination for 1 hr caused a 76% reduction in cell growth. Thymidine (dThd, 10 microM), if given concomitantly with the combination of cisplatin and 5FUra, completely protected the tumor cells. A 30-min exposure to cisplatin increased the intracellular pools of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate 2.5-fold. The capacity of intact cells to form 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP)-thymidylate (dTMP) synthase complex when incubated with fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) was enhanced 2.5-fold when the cells were pretreated with cisplatin. These experiments demonstrate that cisplatin can increase the availability of the reduced folate necessary for tight binding of FdUMP to dTMP synthase, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of the cisplatin and 5FUra combination.\r"

In addition, we describe a more generally applicable \"indirect-labeling\" method in which separated compounds of interest are selectively bound to ligands containing highly neutron-activatable elements, such as manganese (55Mn), europium (151Eu), or dysprosium (164Dy), and then irradiated with thermal neutrons. This method is illustrated with nucleotides separated by TLC and with proteins separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In contrast to the direct-labeling approach, the indirect-labeling method can be adapted to detect any class of substances for which a highly neutron-activatable, selectively binding ligand is available. The theoretically achievable sensitivity of the indirect-labeling method is in the attomole (10(-18) mol) range.\r"

According to both methods, glucagon administration at the physiological level evoked Ca2+ release. The released Ca2+ originated mostly from a carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)-depletable pool and also from an FCCP-insensitive pool from which Ca2+ could be released with A23187. Maximally effective doses of glucagon and vasopressin had no additive effect on Ca2+ release. Prior administration of vasopressin resulted in markedly reduced Ca2+ release by glucagon. These results indicate that glucagon releases Ca2+ from the same pool that vasopressin does.\r"

The 46-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain of DBP binds RNA in vitro and was found to be associated with polyadenylylated RNA in vivo. This is the same domain that interacts with DNA. However, the differences in sensitivity of DBP to trypsin when bound to RNA versus DNA suggest that RNA and DNA either bind at different sites within this domain or induce different conformational changes within the protein.\r"

Both an intact promoter and a portion of the remainder of the gene, but not the gene product, are required. However, no particular section of the gene outside the promoter appears to be necessary; only the size of the section remaining appears to be important. These observations suggest that transcription of this gene may be responsible for its effect on DNA supercoiling.\r"

A 1626-base-pair human adrenal P450scc cDNA was cloned in bacteriophage lambda gt10. Primer extension data indicated P450scc mRNA is about 1850 bases long and that all adrenal P450scc mRNA has the same 5' end. A full-length clone containing 1821 bases was obtained from a human testis cDNA library to yield the complete sequence. The encoded human preP450scc contains 521 amino acids with a molecular weight of 60189.65. The testis and adrenal sequences were identical; the human cDNA and amino acid sequences are 82% and 72% homologous, respectively, with the bovine sequences. P450scc cDNA was used to probe DNA from a panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids, showing that the single human P450scc gene lies on chromosome 15. The human P450scc gene is expressed in the placenta in early and midgestation; primary cultures of placental tissue indicate P450scc mRNA accumulates in response to cyclic AMP.\r"

Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed the presence of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues on the polypeptide backbone. The selective nature of the phosphorylation event was further demonstrated in vitro by a protein kinase (Mr 50,000), which was present in virus-infected cells but absent from uninfected cells or purified virions. The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of 32Pi from [gamma-32P]ATP to gpI but not to gpII and gpIII.

The lifetime of this tyrosine fluorescence is 620 +/- 50 ps (mean +/- SD) and is little affected by addition of 0.88 M citrate, an efficient quencher of tyrosine fluorescence. The steady-state emission intensity is also only weakly reduced by the quencher. The tyrosine is thus not accessible to the citrate and is probably located in the interior of the protein. The high pK of the tyrosine supports this conclusion. The fluorescence anisotropy decay of the inhibitor's tyrosine can be fitted to a double exponential form, with time constants of about 40 ps and greater than or equal to 3 ns. The anisotropy at time zero is 0.19 +/- 0.015 (mean +/- SD), the same as for N-acetyl-L-tyrosinamide in viscous glycerol solution. The nanosecond component of the decay is consistent with rotation of the entire protein molecule. The 40-ps component demonstrates that the tyrosine has considerable freedom to move independently of the protein as a whole. This rotational correlation time is approximately what is observed for free tyrosine in aqueous solution. Since the polypeptide chain near tyrosine-69 is anchored by several disulfide bonds, the data argue that this interior portion of the protein consists of a rigid, immobile backbone embedded in fluid, mobile amino acid side chains.\r"

We report molecular dynamics simulations for myoglobin and cytochrome c in vacuo that predict that this cooling occurs on the ps time scale. The decay of the vibrational temperature is nonexponential with about 50% loss occurring in 1-4 ps and with the remainder in 20-40 ps.

The micrographs show that the cytoskeletal framework, chromosomes, spindle, and centrioles form an interconnected entity. The pericentriolar region, indistinct in conventional micrographs, appears composed of distinct fibers interconnecting the spindle microtubules and centriole.

On the basis of a model of the translocation process to be described elsewhere, we propose an explanation of previous findings that the in vitro translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum of secretory proteins of higher eukaryotic cells appears to be obligatorily co-translational (i.e., occurs only while the polypeptide chain is being synthesized on the ribosome). We suggest that in vitro the intrachain disulfide bonds of the polypeptide rapidly form after it is released from the ribosome; the three-dimensional conformation of the chain is thereby stabilized and cannot undergo the unfolding that is required for post-translational translocation. In accord with this proposal, we show that the secretory preprotein human preprolactin, after translation and release from the ribosome, can indeed undergo translocation across endoplasmic reticulum membranes in vitro if the medium is sufficiently reducing. Those polypeptides that, in the absence of reducing agents, can be post-translationally translocated in vitro across bacterial, mitochondrial, and other types of membranes may generally lack intrachain disulfide bonds.\r"

It is present at the surface of all endothelial and hemopoietic cells (except mature erythrocytes) starting from the hemangioblast, the early mesodermal precursor of blood and vascular endothelial cells. The MB1 epitope is also found on quail plasma molecules of 80 and 125-200 kDa. By immunoprecipitation of either surface or metabolically labeled endothelial cellular material, we have chemically characterized MB1-bearing components as glycoproteins of apparent molecular mass ranging from 80 to 200 kDa and provided evidence for their release into the culture medium. This is consistent with the hypothesis that, in the quail, vascular endothelium participates in the secretion of the alpha-MB1-positive plasmatic components.\r"

  ".W": "The intracellular receptor for thyroid hormone is a protein found in chromatin. Since thyroid hormone stimulates transcription of the growth hormone gene through an unknown mechanism, the hypothesis that the thyroid hormone-receptor complex interacts with defined regions of this gene has been investigated in a cell-free system. Nuclear extracts from human lymphoblastoid IM-9 cells containing thyroid hormone receptors were incubated with L-3,5,3'-tri[125I]iodothyronine and calf thymus DNA-cellulose. Restriction fragments of the human growth hormone gene were added to determine their ability to inhibit labeled receptor binding to DNA-cellulose. These fragments encompassed nucleotide sequences from about three kilobase pairs upstream to about four kilobase pairs downstream from the transcription initiation site. The thyroid hormone-receptor complex bound preferentially to the 5'-flanking sequences of the growth hormone gene in a region between nucleotide coordinates -290 and -129. The receptor also bound to an analogous promoter region in the human placental lactogen gene, which has 92% nucleotide sequence homology with the growth hormone gene. These binding regions appear to be distinct from those that are recognized by the receptor for glucocorticoids, which stimulate growth hormone gene expression synergistically with thyroid hormone. The presence of thyroid hormone was required for binding of its receptor to the growth hormone gene promoter, suggesting that thyroid hormone renders the receptor capable of recognizing specific gene regions.\r"

  ".W": "Cell membranes prepared from senescent human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) inhibited entry into S phase by 35% when added to the medium of replicating young HDF. This membrane-associated inhibitory activity was (i) sensitive to trypsin, heat, and periodate, which suggests that the inhibitor is a glycoprotein, and (ii) not able to inhibit DNA synthesis in simian virus 40-transformed HDF, which indicates that not all types of cells are sensitive to this inhibitor. Quiescent young HDF also have a surface membrane-associated inhibitor of DNA synthesis. A comparison of the senescent HDF and quiescent HDF inhibitor activities indicates that they may have the same chemical and physical nature and the same specific activity, but their regulation is different. The inhibitory activity of quiescent young HDF is abolished within 20 hr after refeeding with fresh serum-containing medium, whereas that of senescent HDF remains unchanged. Quiescent old HDF (two or three population doublings remaining) exhibit an intermediate response to serum with approximately two-thirds of the inhibitory activity abolished. The fraction of cells in S phase at 20-24 hr post-stimulation (37% in young HDF, 24% in old HDF, and 0% in senescent HDF) is inversely proportional to inhibitor levels. This suggests that inability to neutralize the inhibitory activity in response to serum stimulation could be involved in the inability of senescent HDF to enter S phase. Disappearance of the inhibitory activity from quiescent young HDF occurs late in G1 phase. Thus, the inhibitor may play a role in determining the length of the G0 to S phase transition in these cells.\r"

Epon-embedded samples were cut into 0.25-micron-thick sections that were imaged at 1 MV with a high-voltage electron microscope. For the reconstruction shown, a tilt series of 53 micrographs was taken at tilt angles between -54 degrees and +50 degrees. The reconstruction was accomplished from these projections using a weighted back-projection algorithm. The 12-nm resolution of the reconstruction was sufficient to resolve the outer doublet and central pair microtubules, dynein arms, radial spokes, and central sheath structures. The reconstruction can be viewed from various angles and with appropriate parts cut away to reveal structural features of interest. The sense of depth in these views can be enhanced by stereo viewing of shaded surface images. From this reconstruction, we determined that newt lung cilia contain the more common triplet grouping of radial spokes.\r"

The intracellular pH (pHi) of sperm was also determined. The fucose sulfate-rich glycoconjugate component of egg jelly induced increases in [Ca2+]i and pHi in sperm and induced the acrosome reaction. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to external domains of a 210-kDa glycoprotein of the sperm plasma membrane induced a 23-fold increase in [Ca2+]i (vs. 9-fold for fucose sulfate-rich glycoconjugate), but the mAbs did not cause the pHi to increase and did not induce the acrosome reaction. When the mAb treatment which induced an increase in [Ca2+]i was combined with an NH4Cl treatment, which increased the pHi, the acrosome reaction was induced. mAb-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were dependent on millimolar concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ and were reversed by placing sperm in Ca2+-free seawater or by chelating Ca2+ with EGTA. The mAb-induced [Ca2+]i increase was sensitive to the pH of the seawater, although mAb binding was not. The data show that increased [Ca2+]i and pHi are necessary for induction of the acrosome reaction and suggest that the 210-kDa protein may play a role in regulating Ca2+ entry into the spermatozoan. These mAbs make it possible to separate the increase in [Ca2+]i from the increase in pHi and may be useful in the elucidation of the regulatory role of Ca2+ in sperm physiology.\r"

Here, we report the use of DNA probes labeled with biotinylated psoralen to provide nonisotopic detection of HLA class II RFLP patterns. These biotinylated probes contain cDNA sequences encoding the alpha and beta chains of DP, DQ, and DR HLA class II genes as inserts in M13 vectors. The recombinant M13 molecules are partially double-stranded with single-stranded HLA cDNA regions and contain biotinylated psoralen covalently linked to duplex DNA by UV irradiation. Following hybridization, the presence of biotinylated probe bound to target DNA is detected using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, which converts the colorless substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine to a blue precipitate in less than 1 hr. The probe and detection system described here can detect single-copy genes in less than 0.5 microgram of total human DNA on Southern blots and generates the same specific RFLP patterns as do probes labeled with 32P by nick-translation. These biotinylated HLA class II probes have been applied to tissue typing for bone marrow transplantation and the study of insulin-dependent diabetes susceptibility, revealing in each case relevant polymorphisms not detected by serologic typing.\r"

As in Drosophila, homeo-box sequences of mammalian species are expressed in a temporal and tissue-specific pattern during embryogenesis. These observations suggest functional homologies between dipteran and mammalian homeo-box gene products. To identify possible relationships between homeo-box genes of mice and humans, we have compared the chromosomal location of homeo-box genes in these species. Using in situ hybridization and somatic cell genetic techniques, we have mapped the chromosome 6-specific murine Hox-1 homolog to the region p14-p21 on human chromosome 7. We have also regionally mapped the murine Hox-3 locus to 15F1-3 and its human cognate to 12q11-q21. These comparative mapping data indicate that a syntenic relationship in mice and humans is maintained for all homeo-box loci examined to date. We suggest these regions represent evolutionarily conserved genomic domains encoding homologous protein products that function in regulating patterns of mammalian development.\r"

Furthermore, anti-p185 antibody treatment was able to inhibit the growth of the rat neuroblastoma cells from which the neu oncogene was initially isolated.

Treatment with doxorubicin prevented the rapid degradation of surface-bound complement component C3b that has been identified as a protective mechanism of complement-resistant melanoma cells. Doxorubicin caused the increased complement susceptibility as free drug and after immobilization onto glass beads to prevent cellular uptake. Immobilized doxorubicin was more effective than free drug, causing enhanced complement susceptibility at concentrations where the free drug was no longer active. In contrast to free doxorubicin, which exhibited a direct cytotoxic effect leading to cell death within 4 days, immobilized doxorubicin did not affect cell viability. These findings suggest that combination therapy of the complement-activating monoclonal antibody R24 with the complement-enhancing drug doxorubicin may be a promising approach for the treatment of melanoma.\r"

These nucleotide sequences were compared to beta 1 and beta 2 chains of other DR haplotypes. The first-domain sequences of beta 2 chains are identical in DR4 and DR7 haplotypes. In addition, there is strong sequence homology within the 3' untranslated regions of beta 1 genes from DR4, -7, and -9 haplotypes, thus confirming the close evolutionary relationship among these three haplotypes. In contrast, the first-domain sequences of beta 1 molecules from these haplotypes are very different from each other and do not reflect the DR4, -7, -9 family relationship. Two explanations for the differences in degree of diversity between beta 1 and beta 2 chains are suggested. The differences may be a consequence of selection pressures; this implies functional differences for products of the beta 1 and beta 2 loci. Alternatively, closely linked segments of the human class II region may differ in their underlying rates of variation, independent of selection pressures, and this may in part account for the extraordinary diversity found in the beta 1 first domain.\r"

  ".U": "87067473\r", 
  ".W": "The growth and development of the placenta is critical to fetal growth and development; however, little is known regarding the mechanisms controlling placental growth and development. Human placental membranes are known to possess receptors for insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) from early gestation, and increasing evidence supports a major role for IGF-I and/or IGF-II in fetal growth and development. Therefore, the IGFs may also play a significant role in regulating placental growth and development. We report here that an adult human liver IGF-II cDNA hybridizes to poly(A)+ RNAs of human placentas from different gestational ages. There are four placental poly(A)+ RNA species that hybridize to IGF-II cDNA, the major one of which is about 6000 bases. The sizes of the hybridized transcripts are the same for placentas of different gestational ages. Furthermore, the IGF-II sequences expressed in the human placenta were quantitated by dot blot hybridization. The second trimester placenta expresses more IGF-II mRNA sequences than placenta of first trimester and term. Interestingly, the term placentas from diabetic pregnancies also express more of these sequences than those from normal pregnancies. These results suggest that there are developmental changes in the expression of the IGF-II gene in the placenta and that IGF-II may promote placental growth by way of an autocrine and/or paracrine mechanism. Moreover, fetuses developing in diabetic pregnancies receive a large influx of glucose, which in turn may stimulate the expression of IGF-II sequences in placenta, resulting in higher utilization of glucose and overgrowth of placenta. This may explain the macrosomia and high incidence of malformations and stillbirths known to result from pregnancies in diabetics.\r"

By 2 weeks posttransection, the extent of neuronal loss was 50% of the total neurons and 70% of the cholinergic neurons in the MS and 30% of the total neurons and 40% of the cholinergic neurons in the VDB. We hypothesized that (i) the death was due to the loss of a hippocampus-derived neuronotrophic factor, and (ii) exogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) might provide trophic support to the MS/VDB cholinergic neurons, in light of recent reports that the septal diagonal band cholinergic neurons are responsive to NGF and that NGF is present and produced in the hippocampus. In the present study, we attempted to prevent the transection-induced neuronal death by continuous infusion of exogenous 7S NGF (1 microgram/wk) through an intraventricular cannula device. We report here that NGF treatment significantly reduces both the total neuronal and cholinergic neuronal death found 2 weeks after fimbria fornix transection; there was a sparing of 50% of the neurons in the MS and essentially 100% of those in the VDB that otherwise would have died. We conclude that NGF also has a protective effect on noncholinergic neurons since calculations indicate that 80% of the NGF-affected neurons are noncholinergic.\r"

Furthermore, statistically significant correlations are obtained between the apparent affinity (Kd) of [35S]TBPS estimated in the presence of these anions and their relative permeabilities through GABA-gated chloride channels. The latter relationships obtained whether the Kd of [35S]TBPS as estimated in rat cerebral cortex was correlated with the relative permeabilities of these anions in either frog dorsal root ganglion cells or primary cultures of mouse spinal cord neurons. These findings strongly suggest that [35S]TBPS binds to GABA-gated chloride channels and that the apparent affinity of this radioligand is directly related to the permeability of these channels.

  ".W": "A synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to residues 185-196 of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit, which contains the adjacent cysteine residues at positions 192 and 193, was recently shown by us to contain the essential elements for alpha-bungarotoxin binding. In the present study, we have used Sepharose-linked peptides for quantitative analysis of the cholinergic binding properties of this and other synthetic peptides. Sepharose-linked peptides corresponding to residues 1-20, 126-143, 143-158, 169-181, 185-196, 193-210, and 394-409 of the alpha subunit of Torpedo acetylcholine receptor, as well as a peptide corresponding to residues 185-196 of the alpha subunit of human acetylcholine receptor, were tested for their toxin-binding capacity. Of these immobilized peptides, only peptide 185-196 of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor bound toxin significantly, thus verifying that this synthetic peptide contains essential components of the receptor toxin-binding site. Analysis of toxin binding to the peptide yielded a dissociation constant of 3.5 X 10(-5) M. This binding was inhibited by various cholinergic ligands. The inhibition potency obtained was alpha-bungarotoxin greater than Naja naja siamensis toxin greater than d-tubocurarine greater than decamethonium greater than acetylcholine greater than carbamoylcholine. This pharmacological profile resembles that of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and therefore suggests that the synthetic dodecapeptide also includes the neurotransmitter binding site. Reduction and carboxymethylation of the cysteine residues on peptide 185-196 inhibit its capacity to bind toxin, demonstrating that an intact disulfide is required for toxin binding. A decrease in toxin binding was also obtained following chemical modification of the tryptophan residue at position 187, thus implying its possible involvement in toxin binding. The failure to detect binding of toxin to the corresponding human sequence 185-196, in which the tryptophan residue is replaced by serine, supports this hypothesis.\r"

As the basic elements of retinal receptive fields are well described by the Gaussian function, it is natural to model receptive fields beyond this level as a convergence of Gaussian subunits. In this paper the full two-dimensional solution to the problem of calculating the response to drifting gratings of a model receptive field composed of Gaussian subunits is presented. The subunits are not required to be radially symmetric, any number is allowed, with any temporal phase delays; and responses are predicted to gratings of any spatial frequency at any orientation. This solution will greatly extend the range of receptive fields that can be modeled as a convergence of Gaussian subunits, including those with orientational and directional selectivities.\r"

  ".U": "87067491\r", 
  ".W": "The mouse mutant jimpy carries an X chromosome-linked recessive gene defect that affects the formation of myelin in the central nervous system. To understand the molecular basis of the jimpy mutation, we have examined the expression of mRNAs encoding myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). PLP mRNAs were detectable in jimpy brain RNA at 21 days after birth but were severely reduced in abundance compared to wild-type littermates. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA clones for PLP mRNA, isolated from a cDNA library of jimpy brain poly(A)+ RNA, revealed that the PLP mRNA expressed in jimpy contained a deletion of 74 nucleotides with respect to the wild-type sequence. This deletion causes a frameshift in the open reading frame resulting in an altered carboxyl terminus for jimpy PLP. Probes specific for the deleted sequence, however, hybridize with equal efficiency to genomic DNA from jimpy and wild-type littermates, suggesting that the defect in the jimpy PLP mRNA is generated by aberrant RNA processing rather than by deletion of genomic sequences. We conclude that a mutation in the gene for PLP that leads to an incorrectly spliced RNA transcript is the primary defect of this genetic disorder.\r"

  ".W": "A somatostatin analog (SMS 201-995) was used to treat symptomatic patients with a residual tumor burden of gastrinoma or medullary thyroid carcinoma and pathologic elevations of circulating marker peptides associated with these neuroendocrine tumors. Possible inhibitory effects of the analog on marker peptides, patients' symptoms, or tumor progression were studied in a dose-response protocol and during several months of self-injection of SMS 201-995. Both patients reported remarkable relief of secretory diarrhea and other symptoms, and serum gastrin was successfully suppressed by increasing doses of the analog. However, no effect was seen in reduction of hypercalcitoninemia. Morphologic imaging of residual tumor showed no progression of medullary thyroid carcinoma during treatment and, in the case of hepatic gastrinoma metastases, remarkable tumor regression was confirmed. No toxicity or glucose intolerance was experienced. Somatostatin analog shows promise for palliative management of endocrinologic symptoms due to neuroendocrine tumors, and an inhibitory effect can be measured in some but not all peptide markers. Further evidence of its negative trophic effect on tumor blood flow may suggest an antineoplastic potential, as well as palliative use of this new treatment.\r"

This patient, who was severely disabled by the rash of necrolytic migratory erythema and brittle diabetes mellitus, allowed us to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SMS 201-995 and to gain insight into the origin of the rash. SMS 201-995 was administered subcutaneously (.05 mg twice a day). The rash improved markedly within 48 hours and was completely resolved within 1 week of treatment. Insulin requirements decreased from 90 U/day to zero during the first week of treatment. Corresponding to improvement in clinical symptoms circulating glucagon levels showed a marked decrease. There was no substantial change in plasma or urinary levels of zinc or in plasma amino acid levels. When SMS 201-995 was stopped, the rash recurred within 36 hours and it improved within 48 hours of readministration. The rash and diabetes have remained well controlled during 8 months of therapy but no change in tumor size has been seen on CT scan. The rapid changes in the rash related to the administration of SMS 201-995 indicate that the pathogenesis of necrolytic migratory erythema is probably due to circulating hyperglucagonemia or some other hormonal substance produced by the tumor.\r"

These data support the theory that essential fatty acids are necessary to maintain proper lung function. In this respect, the chicken is a good model for studying the relationship between EFAD and pulmonary disease in CF patients.\r"

We studied 18 normal volunteers and 24 patients with CRI due to hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus with creatinine clearances between 19 and 83 mL/min/1.73 m2. Clearance studies were performed with the first dose of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) to compare acute effects of the agent with a no-drug control. Subjects then received the NSAID for three to five days and, on the last day of study, underwent another clearance study to assess the effects of a single dose of NSAID superimposed on chronic dosing. With each dose of each NSAID, inulin and paraaminohippurate (PAH) clearances and fractional excretion of NA+ decreased. However, the baseline control collections after chronic dosing did not differ from the no-drug control periods. Hence, the decline in renal function with each dose is transient, and no overall adverse effect on renal function occurred with chronic dosing. In five patients with cirrhosis, we assessed the renal sparing effects of sulindac. After equilibration on a fixed sodium intake, they received a 200-mg dose of sulindac. In one patient, no adverse effect occurred; the remaining patients suffered declines in creatinine clearance of 29%, 87%, 37%, and 37%, respectively. This effect was transient and returned to control values six to eight hours after sulindac administration. At the time of maximal depression of renal function, serum concentrations of sulindac sulfide were comparable to those in subjects with normal hepatic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the possibility that 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol acts in human amnion as a physiologic calcium ionophore to effect increased prostaglandin E2 production in this tissue. This possibility was based on the propositions that this metabolite of vitamin D3 acts in other target tissues, that is, bone, intestine, chorioallantoic membrane, kidney, and intestine, to effect increased calcium absorption, that 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is present in amniotic fluid, which bathes the amnion, and that the mobilization of calcium in amnion is associated with stimulation of enzymes, namely, phospholipase A2 and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C that act ultimately to effect the release of arachidonic acid, which in turn leads to increased prostaglandin E2 production. We found that human amnion cells, maintained in primary monolayer culture, are responsive to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Treatment of these cells with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol for 18 hours brought about the induction, in a dose-dependent manner, of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol 24-hydroxylase, a marker of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol action. In addition, treatment of human amnion cells in monolayer culture with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol caused, within 12 hours, a significant increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin E2, which was maintained for the duration of treatment, that is, 48 hours. These findings may be indicative of a significant physiologic role for 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in metabolic processes that are important in amnion, including transport, amniotic fluid volume homeostasis, and the initiation of parturition.\r"

Fetal infusion of 4-aminoantipyrine has been shown to decrease myometrial activity and to significantly lower prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite levels. Since prostaglandins are thought to be important in regulating uterine and umbilical blood flow, their decrease could cause significant changes in blood flow. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of antipyrine on uterine and umbilical blood flow as measured with electromagnetic flow probes and to determine whether antipyrine causes significant changes in levels of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite, and prostaglandin I2 measured as 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. Antipyrine infusion produced significant reductions in the uterine venous levels of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite (p less than 0.05). These reductions in prostaglandin levels were not associated with any significant changes in maternal blood pressure, heart rate, uterine blood flow, or oxygen content. Although fetal prostaglandin levels tended to decrease during the antipyrine infusion, these changes were not significant. Fetal blood pressure, heart rate, umbilical blood flow, PaO2, and oxygen content were not significantly altered. These data suggest that the antipyrine method does not affect basal blood flow in the uterine or umbilical circulation even though uterine prostaglandin levels are significantly decreased.\r"

However, it is not known whether amniotic prostaglandin E2 can reach the decidua and/or myometrium. We examined whether prostaglandin E2 could cross the amnion and full-thickness membranes and whether this capacity changed with active labor. Using an in vitro system we found that there was a time-dependent cumulative transfer of total radioactivity and of radioactivity corresponding chromatographically to prostaglandin E2 across amnion and full-thickness membranes. The rate of transfer across the amnion was faster than across full-thickness membranes and varied according to the site of tissue sampling within the uterus. The permeability constant for prostaglandin E2 transfer across full-thickness membranes was significantly higher in tissue collected after the spontaneous onset of labor than in tissue collected at elective cesarean section at term. We conclude that prostaglandin E2 produced in human amnion at term may escape metabolism in the chorion and reach the decidua and/or myometrium.\r"

  ".U": "87073592\r", 
  ".W": "Amnion is believed to be a tissue of central importance in the biochemical processes of parturition. In this tissue, prostaglandin E2 is the near exclusive prostaglandin produced. And although the production of prostaglandin E2 is increased during labor in women, the levels of the major metabolite of prostaglandin E2 in maternal plasma are not elevated; rather, the levels of 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin F2 alpha, the major circulating metabolite of prostaglandin F2 alpha, are increased strikingly. Because of this apparent paradox, we considered the possibility that prostaglandin E2, originating in amnion, chorion laeve, or decidua vera, is converted to prostaglandin F2 alpha in decidua vera by the action of prostaglandin E2-9-ketoreductase. We found that prostaglandin E2 9-ketoreductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin E2 to F2 alpha, is present in cytosolic fractions prepared from homogenates of uterine decidua vera tissue. The specific activity of 9-ketoreductase in cytosolic fractions of decidua of six women varied from 3.2 to 155 pmol X min-1 X mg-1 protein. We also evaluated the conversion of exogenous prostaglandin E2 to F2 alpha in intact human endometrial stromal cells in monolayer culture. We found that prostaglandin E2, added to the culture medium, was converted to prostaglandin F2 alpha by endometrial stromal cells that were maintained in the presence of inhibitors of prostaglandin synthase. The extent of conversion of exogenous prostaglandin E2 to F2 alpha, however, was low relative to the specific activity of prostaglandin E2 9-ketoreductase found in decidual cytosol. These findings are consistent with the possibility that prostaglandin E2 formed in decidua vera tissue may be converted in that tissue to prostaglandin F2 alpha by 9-ketoreductase; on the other hand, prostaglandin E2 formed in contiguous tissues probably is not converted significantly to prostaglandin F2 alpha by decidual 9-ketoreductase.\r"

We studied the distribution ratio of enoxacin between plasma and bronchial mucosa under steady-state conditions. Bronchial mucosal biopsies were obtained during fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 18 patients after receiving enoxacin, 400 mg every 12 h for 4 days. Bronchial mucosa and plasma were sampled at 3, 4, or 5 h (6 patients each) after the fifth day morning 400-mg dose and assayed for enoxacin by high pressure liquid chromatography. There was no significant difference in the enoxacin bronchial mucosa to plasma concentration ratios at the 3 sampling times. This suggests that equilibrium between bronchial mucosa and plasma had been achieved within 3 h after dose. The mean (SD) bronchial mucosal concentration for all patients was 117.0 (47.8) micrograms/g, the mean (SD) plasma concentration was 3.1 (1.1) micrograms/ml, and the mean (SD) ratio was 46.8 (45.9). The bronchial mucosal enoxacin concentrations were significantly higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations for common respiratory pathogens including Ps. aeruginosa (90% inhibited by 2.0 micrograms/ml). These results provide pharmacokinetic support for the use of enoxacin in gram-negative bronchial infections.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-six patients receiving remission induction treatment for acute leukemia were studied in a randomized trial comparing ciprofloxacin with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus colistin for prevention of infections. Both groups received amphotericin B for antifungal prophylaxis. Six major infections occurred in 28 patients receiving ciprofloxacin, and 11 major infections occurred in 28 patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus colistin. No infections caused by gram-negative bacilli were seen in the ciprofloxacin group (p less than 0.02). Ciprofloxacin prevented colonization with resistant gram-negative bacilli, but 12 resistant colonizing strains were isolated from 10 patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus colistin (p less than 0.01). Ciprofloxacin was better tolerated: 23 of 28 patients were highly compliant to the drug, compared with 15 of 28 patients in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that ciprofloxacin is a promising drug for the prevention of infection in patients with granulocytopenia.\r"

In the course of this developmental process they express many erythroid-specific markers. In order to investigate the expression of cell surface determinants during Rauscher cell differentiation we generated monoclonal antibodies to uninduced cells. Using an anti-Rauscher cell monoclonal antibody, we have identified a cell surface determinant, designated ERY-1, that is present on normal murine erythroid cells. This determinant is apparently absent from the early progenitor BFU-E, but is present on the more mature progenitors CFU-E and CFC-E. It disappears during erythroid maturation and is absent from the mature erythrocyte. This pattern of ERY-1 expression is exhibited with remarkable fidelity during the erythropoietin-induced differentiation of Rauscher cells. Such differentiation-specific expression of the ERY-1 determinant suggests that it may play a functional role in erythropoiesis.\r"

Between 1974 and 1985, we treated 27 patients with APL using four different chemotherapeutic regimens; 23/27 (85%) had evidence of DIC either at presentation or following the initiation of induction chemotherapy. The coagulopathy was treated primarily with fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions; only 2/27 (7%) patients received heparin. Twenty of 27 patients (74%) entered complete remission. Major bleeding or thrombotic complications occurred in 5/27 patients (19%), but 2 of these 5 patients presented after hemorrhage had already occurred. None of the 5 patients with bleeding or thrombosis entered complete remission. All of the hemorrhagic complications due to DIC in our study occurred before 1979, which may reflect changes in the management of leukemic patients. This observation emphasizes the risks inherent in the use of historical controls in this population. In conclusion the DIC associated with APL can be successfully treated with intensive blood product support without the use of heparin.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of cis-retinoic acid (cisRA) on the clonogenic growth of samples of leukemic cells from 35 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). We observed significant inhibition of leukemic colony growth in 17 samples by 10(-7) to 10(-6)M cisRA. However, we found that retinoid exposure resulted in striking stimulation of clonal growth in ten samples at the same drug concentrations. With the exception of cases with promyelocytic features, there was no morphologic or functional evidence that cisRA induced the leukemic blasts to differentiate. Both inhibition and stimulation were dose-dependent and observable at pharmacologically achievable levels of cisRA. Leukemic cells with monocytic features more frequently demonstrated a stimulatory response than did those without monocytic features. Depletion of T lymphocytes and monocytes did not alter the type of growth response. Assays for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) were performed on five samples (two with inhibitory growth responses, two with stimulatory responses, and one with no growth) and failed to reveal detectable levels of CRABP in any case. The addition of cisRA to liquid suspensions of leukemic cells produced no significant change in the number of viable cells. We conclude that the effects of cisRA on leukemic colony growth are not cytotoxic and not mediated by T lymphocytes, monocytes, or CRABP. More importantly, cisRA appears to enhance the growth of certain human leukemia cells in vitro. Taking into account the increasing use of retinoids in clinical trials for patients with leukemia, the latter findings may represent a significant cautionary note.\r"

  ".U": "87076974\r", 
  ".W": "We have shown previously that induced maturation of the human myeloid leukemia cell line, HL-60, is associated with a selective down-regulation of guanine ribonucleotide synthesis and depletion of intracellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) pools. We showed, furthermore, that inhibitors of the enzyme, inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step of guanylate synthesis from the central intermediate IMP, are potent inducers of myeloid maturation in these cells. We now show that induced maturation of HL-60 cells is prevented or impaired if intracellular concentrations of guanine ribonucleotides are maintained at high levels. HL-60 cells can utilize exogenous guanine and guanosine to maintain GTP and GDP pools through a salvage pathway that bypasses guanylate synthesis from IMP. Moreover, incubation of HL-60 cells with guanosine or guanine (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/L) prevents both the depletion of intracellular guanine ribonucleotides and the induction of myeloid maturation caused by the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor, tiazofurin. These findings provide strong additional support for the concept that terminal myeloid differentiation is influenced by a guanine ribonucleotide-dependent regulatory system.\r"

  ".W": "Three patients with McArdle's disease exercised for 2 h at 30% VO2max. During exercise two phases occurred. During the first 15 min they experienced progressive fatigue and weakness of exercised muscles, with a rapid and complete recovery (adaptation phase). Following this, all 3 patients were able to continue exercise without difficulty ('second wind' phase). During the adaptation phase, patients have to cope with their inability to use muscle glycogen as a fuel. Processes occurring during this phase are as follows. An increase in cardiac output. This might be expected to increase muscle blood flow in order to supply exercising muscle with substrates that can substitute for muscle glycogen (free fatty acids (FFA), bloodborne glucose).Changes in the metabolic pathways. These cause a sufficient amount of hexose phosphates to be present to overcome the first 2.5 min of exercise, and FFA and bloodborne glucose to play a major role in energy supply at an earlier stage in exercise than in control subjects. An increase in EMG activity. This is most probably caused by the recruitment of more motor units to compensate for a failure of force generation in the muscle fibres. Central command seems to play an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular processes during the adaptation phase. Despite these compensatory mechanisms, metabolic stress occurs during the adaptation phase. During the 'second wind' phase there are no important differences between the metabolism of exercising muscle of patients with McArdle's disease and that of control subjects.\r"
