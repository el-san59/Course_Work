  ".W": "We have studied the functional importance of renal eicosanoids in renal hemodynamics of seven newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients by treatment with two structurally unrelated inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (i.e., piroxicam and sulindac). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), daily urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha, the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin), and thromboxane B2 (TXB2, the stable hydrolysis product of thromboxane A2) were measured before, during, and after piroxicam (all patients) or sulindac (3 patients) treatment. Urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was significantly increased (P less than .01) in diabetic patients compared with seven healthy subjects, whereas urinary excretion of TXB2 was unchanged. The baseline value of GFR was significantly (P less than .01) higher in diabetic compared with normal volunteers, whereas baseline RPF was comparable in both groups. Piroxicam (20 mg/day) reduced urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 by 65.7 +/- 26 and 64.6 +/- 33%, respectively. These biochemical changes were temporally associated with the approximately 19% decrease in GFR (P less than .01). A week after discontinuation of the drug, GFR and urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were still significantly (P less than .05) reduced, whereas urinary excretion of TXB2 returned to control values. In contrast, urinary excretion of eicosanoids and renal function were not affected by sulindac (0.4 g/day) treatment. No functional changes were detected in healthy subjects despite a similar suppression of renal cyclooxygenase activity when they were treated with piroxicam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A polymorphic 5.8-kilobase SstI fragment was found in 12 (23.5%) of 51 NIDDM subjects but only in 4 (7.7%) of 52 nondiabetic control subjects. This association is significant by chi 2-analysis (P less than .05). Furthermore, the nondiabetic subjects with the polymorphism were found to have hyperinsulinemia and/or nondiagnostic glucose tolerance. The polymorphism is a genetic marker for a phenotype that is neither necessary nor, by itself, sufficient for NIDDM. Nevertheless, it may indicate that insulin resistance functionally related to an insulin-receptor gene polymorphism is the proximal cause of NIDDM in at least one subset of the population.\r"

There was a slightly higher risk in wealthier as opposed to poorer classes. This income gradient was more marked in younger than in older children. Children of French extraction had about two-thirds the risk of IDDM of children of other origins, mainly British and other European. This mimics the patterns of risk in Europe, where France is reported to have lower rates than does Britain and Scandinavia. The absolute levels of risks among French Canadian and Jewish Canadian children were about double those reported from France and Israel, respectively. These various results are compatible with the hypothesis that both genetic and environmental factors influence IDDM risk.\r"

The results were compared with antithrombin III incubated at the glucose concentration expected to be found in severely diabetic patients (15 mM). Antithrombin III incubated at 5 mM lost 33% of the heparin cofactor activity after 7 days, whereas antithrombin III incubated at 15 mM lost 50% for the same period. Under both conditions, half of the heparin cofactor activity was lost after 15 days. When D-[U-14C]glucose was used as tracer, approximately 0.6 mol glucose/mol protein was incorporated after 10 days at both concentrations of glucose. A detailed evaluation of the kinetics of inhibition of thrombin by glycosylated antithrombin III revealed that the second-order rate constant is three times smaller than that of normal antithrombin III. On the basis of these data, it is concluded that glycosylated antithrombin III with 50% depressed heparin cofactor activity is three times weaker than normal antithrombin III as an inhibitor of thrombin. The implications of these observations with respect to the possible pathogenesis of thrombosis in diabetes are discussed.\r"

Absorbed dietary cholesterol was determined from measurement of dietary cholesterol intake and previous data for cholesterol fractional absorption. Daily rates of cholesterol synthesis in the small intestine, liver, and periphery were calculated from recovery of labeled sterols after injection of 3H2O at six times during 24 h. Utilization of cholesterol for growth, fecal excretion, and bile acid synthesis were also determined. Absorbed dietary cholesterol in diabetic rats was double that in control rats. The contribution of absorbed cholesterol to total cholesterol production (sum of absorbed dietary cholesterol) and endogenous cholesterol synthesis) in control rats was 24% compared to 48% in diabetic rats. The increase in diabetic rats was due to overeating and, to a lesser extent, to increased fractional absorption. Overeating also induced intestinal hypertrophy and a twofold increase in cholesterol synthesis by the small intestine to 24% of whole-body production in diabetic rats. Consequently, the small intestine accounted for 72% of daily cholesterol input in diabetic rats compared to 37% in control rats, with diet accounting for two-thirds of the cholesterol input via the small intestine in both groups. In response to this increased input from the intestine, cholesterol synthesis in the periphery was 39% of whole-body production in control rats compared to 22% in diabetic rats, and synthesis in the liver was 26 and 6% of total cholesterol production in control and diabetic rats, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The correlation of these with social class and the Jarman underprivileged area score were compared. Wide variations in mortality rates between electoral wards in Sheffield were demonstrated, particularly for deaths from diseases with a large preventable component. Social class correlated more strongly with all-cause mortality (r = 0.69) and preventable mortality (r = 0.91) than did the Jarman score. There was no significant correlation between routine cervical smear rate and either social class or the Jarman score among women under the age of 35 years. Among older women, however, there was a high degree of correlation with fewest smears being taken in the most deprived wards. Social class was more strongly correlated with the invasive cervical cancer rate in electoral wards than was the Jarman score, and was thus a better indicator of the need for cervical screening. However, the Jarman score showed a greater degree of (negative) correlation with the uptake of cervical screening than did social class with disproportionately fewer smears being taken by general practitioners in areas of highest need. Social class may be better than the Jarman score as an indicator of both ill-health and the need for preventive health services in Sheffield. Information is routinely collected decenially on social class and needs little further computation, unlike the Jarman score. Furthermore, much is already known about the relationships between social class and both ill-health and the need for preventive services.\r"

Previous studies have provided strong evidence that students from rural backgrounds, as well as those who expressed an interest at the time of medical school admission for a career in family medicine, are significantly more likely to eventually practise family medicine in rural areas than their peers. US medical schools were classified into three groups based on their written selection factors for preferentially admitting students into the graduating class of 1982. Of those schools with selection factors for students from both a rural background and an interest in a future career in family medicine, 23.7% of their graduates entered family medicine training programmes. This compares with 14.5% of graduates from schools with a preference for students from a rural background, and 12.4% from all other schools (P less than 0.001). Coupled with previous data which shows that family physicians from rural areas are more likely to eventually practise in rural areas than their peers, preferentially admitting students from rural backgrounds interested in a career in family medicine could help to solve the problem of the shortage of primary care physicians in rural areas in the US.\r"

Despite this, significant pressures were experienced and, in common with previous studies over the last 20 years, this research found continuing problems affecting young general practitioners in particular. The main pressures currently experienced were uncertainty and insecurity about work, isolation, poor relationships with other doctors, disillusion with the role of the general practitioner, and an awareness of changing demands. These pressures were related to experience in general practice, amount of study leave and practice organization. Like previous studies, it also appears from this research that continuing education could play an important role in attenuating these difficulties. It is argued that the emphasis should be on developing support, confidence and better contacts between general practitioners, as well as teaching knowledge and skills.\r"

The analyses produce figures that are compatible with the hypothesis that there is a form of creeping specialization taking place with general practitioners tending to provide one type of service at the exclusion of the others.

Application of fluid at 45 degrees C to mucosas or serosas of the stomach, jejunum, or ileum of anesthetized rats promptly evoked consistent cardiovascular responses, namely arterial hypotension, tachycardia, and a diminished intestinal blood flow (latency less than or equal to 5 s with a duration of 2-4 min). Thus, for example, warming of the stomach caused blood pressure to decrease 40%, heart rate to increase 15%, and mesenteric blood flow to decline 50%. These responses were inhibited totally or mostly by capsaicin, administered neonatally, topically, or perineurally, by topical lidocaine, and by parenteral administration of substance P antiserum, somatostatin, or hexamethonium. Epidural anesthesia also inhibited the cardiovascular responses to visceral warming. Pretreatment with reserpine or splanchnic ganglionectomy converted the thermally induced decline in mesenteric blood flow into a vasodilator response, which could then be blocked by an antiserum to substance P. Visceral warming also stimulated afferent, preganglionic sympathetic neural activity. Our conclusions are (a) application of fluid at 45 degrees C to gastrointestinal organs of anesthetized rats initiates a viscerocirculatory reflex that involves primary sensory, afferent C fibers; (b) the major neurotransmitter of this reflex appears to be substance P; and (c) visceral afferent C fibers have central and peripheral vasomotor functions.\r"

This was done by injecting the retrograde fluorescent tracer Fast Blue into these parts of the cat stomach and examining the hindbrain for cells labeled with retrograde tracer. We found that vagal preganglionic innervation to the stomach originates from two medullary nuclei, namely, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (bilateral) and the nucleus retroambiguus (left). All parts of the stomach receive innervation from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (primarily from the area ranging from 0.5 to 1.8 mm rostral to the obex), but only the fundus and corpus receive innervation from the nucleus retroambiguus. Injection of tracer into the fundus labeled cells within the lateral half of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and injection of tracer into the antrum/pylorus labeled cells within the medial portion. Finally, injection of tracer into the corpus labeled cells throughout the mediolateral axis of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The finding of a columnar organization of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus implies some type of functional organization of gastrointestinal control. The fact that vagal inputs to the stomach arise from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and nucleus retroambiguus suggests a separation of vagal pathways controlling different gastric functions (e.g., pacemaker activity, motility, and secretion).\r"

The BCECF fluorescence was calibrated in terms of pHi by using a nigericin-high potassium concentration method to equilibrate pHi and pHo. Average pHi for the cells of Necturus and rabbit was approximately 7.1 in a HEPES-buffered, HCO3-free Ringer's solution. Average pHi in Necturus cells in CO2/HCO3-buffered Ringer's solution was approximately 7.0. An ammonium-loading technique was used to acidify the cell to measure intrinsic buffering capacity (beta i) and to monitor pHi recovery. Average beta i = 28 mM per pH unit in Necturus and 42 mM per pH unit in rabbit cells in HEPES-buffered Ringer's solution. Recovery from an acid load was sodium-dependent, completely inhibited by 100 microM amiloride, and unaffected by changes in potassium concentration between 6 and 25 mM. The results provide evidence in support of the presence of an amiloride-sensitive Na/H exchanger in antral cells from rabbit, guinea pig, and Necturus.\r"

Celiac artery blood flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound and stomach arterial inflow was either left undisturbed or reduced in a controllable fashion by tightening a vessel loop around the celiac artery immediately after mucosal exposure to 2 M NaCl or 150 mM NaCl. The stomach lumen was perfused with saline at pH 1.00 before and after exposure to 2 M NaCl. Gastric mucosal blood flow increased after exposure to 2 M NaCl, and 90 min after mucosal exposure to 2 M NaCl the mucosal surface showed nearly complete restitution of the surface epithelium. In all animals in which mucosal hyperemia was restricted by reducing celiac artery blood flow by 60% after mucosal damage, extensive gastric erosions were present. Similar reduction of celiac artery blood flow in control animals without mucosal damage did not produce visible lesions, and the stomachs proved to be normal by microscopy. These findings show that the gastric mucosal hyperemic response after damage is important for protection of the damaged mucosa during restitution of the gastric surface epithelium.\r"

Histamine increased basal acid secretion fivefold (p less than 0.01) without altering pepsinogen secretion. Cholecystokinin did not stimulate acid secretion but increased pepsinogen secretion by factors of 23.1 at 10(-8) M and 9.1 at 10(-9) M (both p less than 0.01). The combination of 10(-4) M histamine and 10(-9) M cholecystokinin increased acid secretion 3.5-fold and pepsinogen secretion 6.4-fold, statistically equivalent to the sum of the effects of histamine and cholecystokinin alone. Carbachol increased acid secretion and pepsinogen secretion by factors of 4.0 and 10.9, respectively (both p less than 0.01). Pretreatment with 10(-4) M omeprazole abolished basal and carbachol-stimulated acid secretion. However, pepsinogen secretion was unaffected (p greater than 0.05). Furthermore, omeprazole-treated tissues increased pepsinogen secretion by factors of 10.0 with 3 x 10(-7) M carbachol and 9.1 with 10(-9) M cholecystokinin (both p less than 0.01). Thus, basal and secretagogue-stimulated pepsinogen secretion appear independent of acid secretion in intact guinea pig mucosa.\r"

All animals received a pulse of [3H]thymidine before death at weeks 2, 6, 10, 16, 22, 26, or 30. In addition, 8 animals unexposed to 1,2-dimethylhydrazine or vehicle served as baseline controls. Dramatic regional differences were noted in the baseline controls. Crypt length, labeling index, and proliferative zone size were all significantly greater distally than proximally (p less than 0.05), whereas the labeling index of the proliferative zone tended to be enhanced proximally. During 1,2-dimethylhydrazine treatment the crypt length, labeling index, and proliferative zone size increased in both regions. As these parameters changed in parallel, the differences between proximal and distal colon did not change significantly during carcinogenesis. Actual tumor formation did differ, however, with tumors appearing earlier and in greater abundance in the distal colon. These findings show similar proliferative changes in both the proximal and distal colon during 1,2-dimethylhydrazine treatment and indicate that the enhanced baseline proliferative state of the distal colon compared with the proximal colon must be considered in the process of tumor formation.\r"

Fluid output in CF subjects was significantly lower, however, than that of control subjects at any given level of trypsin output. Sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride secretions were all significantly decreased in CF subjects. Bicarbonate and chloride were important determinants of fluid secretion, but at any given bicarbonate or chloride output CF subjects secreted significantly less fluid than control subjects. When bicarbonate and chloride were analyzed as simultaneous predictor variables, adjusted fluid secretion was not significantly different in CF and control subjects. Diminished fluid secretion in CF subjects is therefore caused by impaired chloride, as well as bicarbonate, secretion.\r"

Starch malabsorption in the healthy small intestine was moderate even with a high-starch diet and less than that previously estimated by indirect methods. Unabsorbed starch catabolism by the colonic flora does not seem to explain most of the breath hydrogen excretion.\r"

We have used a well-validated technique for preparing ileal brush border membranes from human cadaveric small intestine. Sodium was transported into the intravesicular space as evident by an osmolality study, which showed negligible binding to the external surface of the vesicles. The presence of an outwardly directed pH gradient stimulated Na+ uptake compared with the no pH gradient condition. Maximal uptake occurred after 5 min with a threefold overshoot over equilibrium. The rate of Na+ uptake was dependent on the extent of the pH gradient generated across the vesicles. Amiloride at 10(-4) M concentration inhibited the initial rate of Na+ uptake by greater than 90% and prevented stimulation of Na+ uptake in the presence of an outwardly directed pH gradient. The imposition of negative membrane potential did not enhance Na+ uptake compared with voltage clamp condition under both pH gradient and no pH gradient conditions, indicating an electroneutral process. Kinetic analysis of the Na+/H+ exchanger at 5 s showed a maximum velocity of 23.2 +/- 0.3 nmol/mg protein.5 s and a Michaelis constant of 14.5 +/- 5.2 mM. These studies demonstrate the presence of a Na+/H+ exchanger in human ileal brush border membrane vesicles.\r"

To study in detail the role of the liver in GABA metabolism, uptake and catabolism of GABA by isolated perfused liver from normal rats and rats with galactosamine- or carbon tetrachloride-induced liver failure were measured. Hepatic GABA uptake was almost complete at GABA concentrations of up to 10 microM and approached saturation at a concentration of 50 microM. The apparent affinity of hepatic GABA uptake was 38 microM and the apparent maximal velocity was 158 nmol/g.min. Hepatic GABA uptake was sodium-dependent. gamma-Aminobutyric acid taken up by the liver was rapidly catabolized as measured by 14CO2 formation from [U-14C]GABA. Aminooxyacetic acid, a GABA transaminase inhibitor, completely and irreversibly inhibited hepatic GABA catabolism and thereby also inhibited hepatic GABA uptake. Although uptake of GABA by livers of carbon tetrachloride- or galactosamine-treated rats was decreased (apparent maximal velocity, 103 and 98 nmol/g.min, respectively), at physiologic GABA concentrations in the perfusate GABA uptake and catabolism was not different from that of untreated controls. The observed impairment of hepatic GABA uptake or catabolism by the diseased liver would be expected to contribute to increased GABA levels in peripheral blood plasma in liver failure. However, the magnitude of the observed impairment would be insufficient to account for a 10-fold increase in such levels.\r"

A range of bile acid secretion rates was obtained during an evening meal and an overnight fast. Duodenal perfusion of polyethylene glycol as a nonabsorbable recovery marker and of [3H]cholesterol and [14C]lecithin as absorbable recovery markers was combined with continuous intravenous infusion of indocyanine green as a hepatic bile marker. Six subjects with gallstones were studied before and during chronic administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (675 mg/day). Duplicate pretreatment studies revealed good reproducibility for biliary lipid coupling and cholesterol absorption. During ursodeoxycholic acid administration there was a significant alteration not only in bile acid/cholesterol coupling (p less than 0.001), but also in bile acid/phospholipid coupling (p less than 0.001). Mean cholesterol absorption decreased from 25% to 15% (p less than 0.001) during ursodeoxycholic acid administration. These effects of chronic ursodeoxycholic acid administration on biliary lipid coupling are similar to those reported for acute administration, and are thus consistent with an effect caused by bile acid lipid-solubilizing capacity.\r"

Secretin increased bile HCO3- secretion from 9 mumol/min (range 6-15) to 131 mumol/min (range 118-200) and lowered the bile duct cell vesicles to 5 U (range 3-9). Acute elevation of arterial PCO2 to 10.9 kPa (range 10.2-11.1) doubled vesicle number in resting duct cells and augmented the secretory response to secretin. At high arterial PCO2, secretin cleared the duct cell cytoplasm of vesicles and more than doubled the basolateral plasma membrane surface area. Taurocholate-induced canalicular choleresis, in contrast, did not alter duct cell morphology. It is concluded that secretin clears the bile duct cell cytoplasm of vesicles as it initiates ductular HCO3- secretion, possibly through causing exocytotic insertion of vesicle material into the basolateral plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to ascertain whether testosterone metabolism is altered in male rats with portal bypass, and whether such changes could contribute to the reduction in serum testosterone concentration and raised serum estrogen levels that are observed in this situation. The metabolic clearance rate of testosterone was determined by a prime-dose constant-infusion technique in male rats subjected to complete portal vein ligation and in sham-operated controls. Testosterone clearance was similar in rats with portal vein ligation and control rats (9.01 +/- 2.29 and 8.26 +/- 2.83 ml/min, respectively) but the clearance per gram of liver was greater in rats with portal vein ligation than in controls (1.18 +/- 0.18 versus 0.68 +/- 0.24 ml/min.g liver, p less than 0.0001). After 180 min of [3H]testosterone infusion, [3H]estradiol comprised 1.2% of plasma total radioactivity in male controls but was increased to 11% in rats with portal vein ligation (p less than 0.005). Similarly, biliary excretion of [3H]estradiol was eightfold greater in male rats with portal vein ligation compared with controls (p less than 0.001). In control male rats, the major metabolites of testosterone present in bile were 2 alpha-hydroxytestosterone, 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone, and 7 alpha-hydroxytestosterone. Portal bypass was associated with reduced biliary excretion of 2 alpha-hydroxytestosterone and 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone to approximately 50% of control, but there was no change in the excretion of 7 alpha-hydroxytestosterone. Conversely, portal bypass was associated with increased formation of dihydrotestosterone, indicating stimulated activity of testosterone 5 alpha-reductase. It is concluded that portal bypass in male rats is associated with altered pathways of testosterone metabolism and, in particular, with increased aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. The site of such estradiol formation has not been determined by this in vivo study. However, selective changes occurred in the regiospecific and stereospecific hydroxylation pathways of testosterone and in 5 alpha-reductase activity after portal bypass in male rats. It is concluded that portal bypass, in the absence of parenchymal liver damage, results in demasculinization and feminization of C19 steroid metabolism in the male rat liver. These metabolic changes could be revelant to the pathogenesis of changes in sexual characteristics in cirrhosis.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of hepatofugal collateral veins, their origins, the direction of blood flow in the major veins and collateral veins, and portal venous pressure. To this end, 230 patients, mostly cirrhotic, who had esophageal or gastric varices, or both, demonstrated by endoscopy were investigated by portal vein catheterization. The findings were correlated with endoscopically assessed degrees of varices. Gastric varices were seen in 57% of the patients with varices due to portal hypertension. In most of the patients with advanced gastric varices, esophageal varices were minimal or absent. When patients with gastric varices were compared with those having predominantly esophageal varices, it was found that advanced gastric varices were more frequently supplied by the short and posterior gastric veins, they were almost always associated with large gastrorenal shunts, and portal venous pressure in patients with large gastric varices was lower. Chronic portal systemic encephalopathy was more common in patients with large gastric varices due to hepatofugal flow of superior mesenteric venous blood in the splenic vein than in patients with predominantly esophageal varices. Thus, the hemodynamics in patients with large gastric varices are distinctly different from those in patients with mainly esophageal varices, and such differences seem to account for the differing incidence of chronic encephalopathy and variceal bleeding.\r"

Early mortality could not be predicted before therapy by individual clinical, laboratory, or histologic findings. Patients who resolved at least one pretreatment laboratory abnormality, improved a pretreatment hyperbilirubinemia, or did not experience biochemical deterioration after 2 wk of corticosteroid treatment survived for at least 6 mo in 98% of instances. Patients who died early had multilobular necrosis at presentation and manifested at least one deficiency in their immediate biochemical response. Death invariably occurred in patients with multilobular necrosis and an unimproved hyperbilirubinemia after 2 wk of therapy. Only 3 of the 5 patients who died, however, could be identified in this fashion. We conclude that no individual abnormality at presentation predicts early mortality. Only patients with multilobular necrosis are at risk for an early demise and death can be predicted in those with an unimproving hyperbilirubinemia. Laboratory improvement after 2 wk of corticosteroid therapy virtually assures immediate survival.\r"

  ".U": "88271876\r", 
  ".W": "In the perfused rat liver, ursodeoxycholate in high dose produces an HCO3- -rich hypercholeresis which we have shown previously to be inhibited by replacement of perfusate Na+ with Li+ or by addition of amiloride (or amiloride analogues). In the present studies, we have determined whether such inhibition is associated with altered ursodeoxycholate biotransformation. Under control conditions, ursodeoxycholate infusion produced a 3.7-fold increase in bile flow and a 9.2-fold increase in biliary HCO3- output. By thin-layer chromatography, ursodeoxycholate radioactivity in bile was present in unconjugated form (15%) or as glycine or taurine amidates. Glucuronide conjugates of ursodeoxycholate accounted for less than 1% of biliary bile acids. Li+/Na+ substitution decreased ursodeoxycholate-stimulated bile flow and HCO3- secretion by greater than 90%, but decreased recovery of ursodeoxycholate and metabolites by only 25%. Amiloride or amiloride analogues decreased ursodeoxycholate-stimulated choleresis and HCO3- output by 38%-76%, yet did not cause decreased recovery of ursodeoxycholate and metabolites. Inhibition of the hypercholeresis was associated with a decrease in unconjugated ursodeoxycholate to less than 2% of total biliary bile acids, a striking increase in ursodeoxycholate glucuronides, and a reciprocal decrease in glycine and taurine amidates. With Li+/Na+ substitution, the predominant metabolites were a mixture of the 24-ester and the 3-aketal (ethereal) glucuronide (29%), and amidation with glycine appeared to be selectively inhibited; with amiloride or its analogues, only the 3-ethereal glucuronide was formed (20%-60% of biliary bile acids), and both taurine and glycine amidation were inhibited. Thus, maneuvers that decrease Na+/H+ exchange inhibit ursodeoxycholate hypercholeresis and cause replacement of unconjugated ursodeoxycholate in bile by its glucuronide. The secretion of unconjugated ursodeoxycholate, a lipophilic bile acid, appears to be necessary for hypercholeresis induced by high-dose ursodeoxycholate infusion.\r"

All subjects were endoscoped at the initiation and at the completion of the study. Endoscopic findings were assessed quantitatively by two observers in two different ways. All subjects but three had gastric mucosal lesions at follow-up endoscopy. There was a good correlation between the endoscopic assessments but no statistical correlation between the endoscopic assessment and the increase in fecal blood loss. The data suggest that factors other than gastric mucosal lesions have to be taken into account when investigating NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding.\r"

Binding of ferritin to the receptor coupled to a microparticulate support was specific for human liver ferritin with no binding of rat or porcine ferritin. Binding was unaffected by a 100-fold excess of human transferrin, human asialoorosomucoid and bovine albumin. After treatment of the receptor protein with trypsin, binding was not detected.

  ".W": "To study possible mechanisms whereby vitamin A and ethanol may affect liver plasma membranes, rats were fed liquid diets containing either 6 international units of vitamin A per kcal or 5 times more, with or without ethanol (36% of total energy as isocaloric substitution for carbohydrate). Vitamin A supplementation resulted in 2- to 3-fold increases of liver plasma membrane free retinol (p less than 0.005) and retinyl esters (p less than 0.001), particularly esters of palmitate and oleate, whereas cholesterol esters did not change. The fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene revealed decreased fluidity as measured by an increase in fluorescence polarization which correlated significantly with retinyl palmitate plus oleate content in membranes. In rats fed ethanol chronically, we first verified our previous observation of a decrease in liver plasma membrane fluorescence polarization. We now find this effect to be associated with (and possibly due to) an increase of cholesterol ester content. In linear regression analysis, the change in fluorescence polarization correlated positively with vitamin A (p less than 0.02) and negatively with cholesterol ester contents (p less than 0.001). Ethanol feeding partially offset the effect of vitamin A supplementation on fluorescence polarization. We conclude from these observations that liver plasma membranes contain a significant amount of vitamin A, that vitamin A supplementation increases membrane fluorescence polarization and that chronic ethanol administration can interfere with this effect.\r"

The mean rate of ethanol elimination for all nine patients increased from 83.6 +/- 4.0 to 100.4 +/- 4.2 mg per kg body weight per hr (p less than 0.02).

Five major patterns of hepatocyte HBsAg were identified: homogeneous [intense and discrete, (Pattern A), faint and discrete, (Pattern B) and faint and grouped (Pattern C)]; globular or spotty (Pattern D), and marginal (Pattern E). Pattern A was always associated with viremia and also very frequently with membrane HBsAg expression, but rarely with active liver disease. It occurred most commonly in HBeAg-positive carrier children and young adults, reflecting an early immune tolerance phase with active virus replication. Pattern B was also usually associated with viremia, but very commonly associated with active disease (70%), reflecting active virus replication with enhanced immune response. Pattern E (marginal HBsAg), which was always in group distribution resembling a clonal expansion, predominated the HBeAg-negative phase and was associated with absence of viremia and occurred mostly in older adults with inactive bipolar disease spectrum (normal liver/mild disease or cirrhosis/hepatocellular carcinoma); this reflects a late phase of inactive virus replication or integration. Patterns C and D did not correlate well with viremia, but also tended to have inactive diseases as did Pattern E. These findings suggest that hepatocyte HBsAg expression is closely related to the natural course of chronic hepatitis B virus infection.\r"

We studied the degree of inhibition of erythroid progenitor cells that results as a function of the time of exposure of mononuclear cells to hepatitis B virus and the ratio of virus to mononuclear cells, the multiplicity of infection. With an overnight incubation of mononuclear cells with hepatitis B virus-containing sera, a multiplicity of infection of greater than one virus per mononuclear cell is required to observe significant inhibition of erythroid colony formation. This multiplicity of infection effect is also observed with purified Dane particles. Exposure of mononuclear cells to an increasing number of Dane particles results in a dose-dependent suppression of erythroid colony formation with significant inhibition observed with a multiplicity of infection of virus to mononuclear cells as low as 5:1. Murine monoclonal antibodies to HBsAg completely neutralize the hepatitis B virus-mediated inhibition of CFU-E while control antibodies do not. Purified HBsAg has no effect on colony formation. In conclusion, the hepatitis B virus-mediated inhibition of erythrogenesis in vitro provides a basis for understanding the bone marrow depression observed during hepatitis B virus infections and may provide an in vitro model for examining hepatitis B virus infection.\r"

There was a strong correlation between the rates of reproducibility and persistence of isolated anti-HBc and the initial anti-HBc titers. Thirty-two subjects with persistent, isolated anti-HBc received four doses of hepatitis B vaccine (5 micrograms, HEVAC B) at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months: 56% developed a primary anti-HBs response in response to hepatitis B vaccine, 16% developed an anamnestic or secondary anti-HBs response, and 28% were undetectable for anti-HBs even after four doses of vaccine. The low rates of reproducibility and persistence of anti-HBc together with the high rate of primary anti-HBs response to hepatitis B vaccine in subjects with isolated anti-HBc raise doubts as to the reliability of anti-HBc (Corzyme, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill.) as a single screening test for hepatitis B infection prior to vaccination and suggests that subjects with isolated anti-HBc, in particular those with low anti-HBc titers, be included in vaccination programs.\r"

We describe a solid-phase radioimmunoassay which allows specific detection of either IgG or IgM antibody to antibody directed against HBsAg. Among 138 chronic hepatitis B virus carriers, IgG autoantiidiotype was detected in 98 (71%) and IgM autoantiidiotype in 10 (80%). The autoantiidiotype reaction was blocked with antibody directed against HBsAg after removal of immune complexes by polyethylene glycol precipitation. The prevalence and levels of both classes of autoantiidiotype antibodies were highest in patients with hepatitis B virus DNA or HBeAg in serum. During follow-up, patients who lost hepatitis B virus DNA and HBeAg from serum had lower titers of autoantiidiotype and were less likely to have autoantiidiotype than patients who persisted in having hepatitis B virus DNA and HBeAg in serum. Thus, the presence and titer of autoantiidiotype correlated with serologic evidence of active viral replication in chronic hepatitis B. These findings suggest that the antibody directed against HBsAg response may play a role in modulating viral replication in chronic hepatitis B.\r"

  ".W": "In normal subjects, thallium-201, administered per rectum, is taken up mainly by the liver (heart/liver ratio in normal subjects: 0.04 to 0.12). It has been claimed that an increased heart/liver ratio is suggestive of portal-caval shunting and portal hypertension. To evaluate the possibility of using thallium-201 as a test to diagnose cirrhosis, we administered this substance per rectum to 33 patients with biochemical evidence, but no clinical symptoms, of liver disease. Laparoscopy and liver biopsy revealed chronic active hepatitis without cirrhosis in 18 patients, and chronic active hepatitis with cirrhosis in the others. The results of conventional liver function tests were similar in both groups. A significant difference, however, was found between the means of fasting serum bile acid concentrations (9.8 +/- 3.2 and 18.3 +/- 4.2 microM per liter) in chronic active hepatitis without cirrhosis and cirrhotic patients, and between the means of the heart/liver ratios 20 min after thallium-201 administration (heart/liver: 0.09 +/- 0.03 and 0.54 +/- 0.13, respectively). Unlike the serum bile acid concentration which gave some overlapping values, the thallium-201 test clearly distinguished the chronic active hepatitis without cirrhosis group from the cirrhotics. In the cirrhotic group, there was a significant correlation between the heart/liver ratio and signs of portal hypertension such as esophageal varices, increased diameter of the vena porta and hypersplenism. The thallium-201 test is therefore useful in discriminating between chronic active hepatitis with and without cirrhosis in clinically asymptomatic subjects with biochemical evidence of moderate liver function impairment. A heart/liver uptake ratio much higher than normal (above 0.30) strongly suggests the development of hepatic cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic sinusoidal fat-storing Ito cells are felt to represent the primary storage site for hepatic vitamin A and may be important collagen-producing effector cells during hepatic fibrogenesis. The cirrhotic liver generally has a decreased vitamin A content with increased numbers of \"transitional\" myofibroblasts adjacent to developing fibrous bands. It has been suggested that Ito cells \"transform\" into these myofibroblasts. The in vivo loss of Ito cell vitamin A can be simulated in vitro as Ito cells spontaneously lose their vitamin A lipid droplets during primary culture. The current study evaluated Ito cell proliferation in vitro with respect to vitamin A content and the extracellular collagen matrix. The cells were grown on a Type I or Type IV collagen matrix to simulate the types of collagens presumed to be present in the space of Disse. Initially it was observed that freshly isolated Ito cells begin to proliferate several days after isolation coincident with the decline of the vitamin A lipid droplets and a decrease in cellular retinyl palmitate. The proliferation rate for passaged Ito cells was similar on either matrix (on Type I collagen: T 1/2 = 2.2 +/- 1.1 days, n = 16; on Type IV collagen: T 1/2 = 3.3 +/- 1.4 days, n = 4; p less than 0.11). This proliferation rate remained constant through Cell Generation 16 and was similar to the rate for primary Ito cells in culture. To evaluate the possibility that primary Ito cell proliferation is causally related to the loss of vitamin A, Ito cells were re-exposed to an increased concentration of retinol in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have investigated the extracellular and intracellular distribution of laminin in normal rat and human liver, in fibrotic human liver and in primary hepatocyte cultures from both species by light and electron microscopy using the indirect immunoperoxidase technique. In normal liver from both species, antibodies to laminin strongly stained basement membranes and formed discontinuous discrete deposits in the wall of the sinusoid. Vascular endothelial and bile duct cells as well as fat-storing cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells strongly stained for this glycoprotein while hepatocytes were negative. In fibrotic human liver, increased amounts of extracellular laminin were usually found. Continuous deposition in the space of Disse was observed in some cases. In addition to fat-storing cells and endothelial cells, hepatocytes were also sometimes positive. Normal rat and human hepatocytes synthesize and secrete laminin in conventional culture, but it remains soluble in the medium. By contrast, in coculture with another rat liver cell type, laminin accumulated around hepatocyte cords. These observations suggest that fat-storing cells and endothelial cells are the major sites of production of laminin in normal liver. However, when their environment is altered (e.g., liver injury, culture), adult hepatocytes are able to synthesize detectable amounts of laminin.\r"

When P-1894B, an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase, was administered, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of the increase to nearly normal control levels at 6 and 10 weeks. There was also by histology a dose-dependent reduction in the degree of hepatic fibrosis. Hepatocellular damage was minimal and its extent did not vary with the degree of fibrosis or the treatment. P-1894B dose dependently reduced the hydroxylation of peptidyl proline in the fibrotic liver. These data suggest that P-1894B inhibited hepatic fibrogenesis by direct action on collagen but not by protection against hepatocellular damage leading to collagen formation. A prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor may be a candidate for use in treatment of hepatic fibrosis.\r"

In order to quantify the contribution of hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells to collagen synthesis in vivo in hepatic fibrogenesis, rats with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis were given [5(3H)]proline and [14C]ornithine intraperitoneally. About 80% of the 14C in albumin and transferrin was present as arginine, following conversion of [14C]ornithine via the urea cycle. In contrast to hepatocyte proteins, in nonparenchymal cells and serum a negligible percentage of the radioactivity was present as [14C]arginine. These combined findings indicate that, in spite of the hepatocellular damage, the labeling of hepatocyte proteins was efficient and specific, validating the use of the proline:ornithine method in this experimental model of hepatic fibrosis. We calculated the [3H]proline/[14C]arginine ratio in hepatic collagen (after correcting for the relative frequencies of amino acids) as a percentage of the same ratio in either albumin or transferrin, the index hepatocyte proteins. In this experimental model, during active fibrogenesis, both hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells increase their production of collagen 2-fold when compared to normal animals, and hepatocytes produce the majority of the newly synthesized hepatic collagen.\r"

The rats received an i.v. injection of latex particles (2 x 10(9) particles per animal) prior to (latex-galactosamine) or 12 to 16 hr subsequent to the galactosamine treatment (galactosamine-latex). Effect of superoxide dismutase on hepatic injury induced by galactosamine or galactosamine-latex treatment was also examined. Oxygen-derived free radical-generating capacity of isolated hepatic macrophages was measured as chemiluminescence with the stimulation of phorbol myristate acetate or latex particles. As compared with normal rats, chemiluminescence of hepatic macrophages from galactosamine-treated rats was 5- to 10-fold enhanced 12 hr following galactosamine treatment and remained elevated for 48 hr. Chemiluminescence of the latex particle-pretreated macrophages in the liver was markedly suppressed even following the galactosamine treatment (p less than 0.01). Compared to galactosamine-treated rats, both lipid peroxide level in the liver tissue and AST and ALT concentration in serum were significantly decreased in the latex-galactosamine-treated rats (p less than 0.01) and increased in the galactosamine-latex-treated rats (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, superoxide dismutase supplementation protected against liver injury induced by the galactosamine-latex treatment. From these results, pretreatment with latex particles suppressed the free radical-generating capacity of hepatic macrophages and protected against hepatic injury induced by galactosamine. In contrast, injection of latex particles after galactosamine treatment aggravated hepatic injury, which was prevented by superoxide dismutase. These data suggest that liver injury induced by galactosamine is modulated by oxygen-derived free radicals from hepatic macrophages.\r"

The effects of zonal liver injury induced by allylformate or CCl4 on this distribution and on the activity of glutamine synthetase as well as of enzymes with different acinar distribution were investigated. Treatment with allylformate or CCl4 at appropriate concentrations led to severe hepatocyte necrosis in the periportal and perivenous zone, respectively, as revealed by histological examination and by the levels of serum marker enzymes. Exposure to allylformate (50 to 100 microliter per kg) for less than 1 day did not change the distribution and activity of glutamine synthetase but reduced the specific activities of the urea cycle enzymes. In contrast, treatment with CCl4 (1,000 microliter per kg) strongly reduced the activity and the acinar region covered by glutamine synthetase but not, for instance, the activities of the urea cycle enzymes. These results in conjunction with the data obtained for other enzymes indicate that a short exposure to these hepatotoxins affects different enzyme activities in close accord with their preferential acinar localization. During prolonged exposure this initial response was often modified due to adaptation. In the case of glutamine synthetase, however, no adaptive appearance of glutamine synthetase in other parts of the acinus could be detected even if the cell population originally expressing this phenotype was destroyed. This extremely inflexible distribution suggests that glutamine synthetase expression is a matter of cell differentiation rather than of modulation by nutritional and hormonal factors (or their acinar gradients) as found for many other hepatic enzymes.\r"

In contrast to controls, renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate did not increase in the cirrhotics in response to acute saline loading. Proximal fractional reabsorption of sodium was estimated by clearance techniques in the presence of a hypotonic diuresis. Cirrhotic subjects with impaired functional liver cell mass as assessed by antipyrine clearance were unable to decrease proximal fractional reabsorption of sodium significantly in response to saline loading. Assessment in the cirrhotics included measurement of hepatic vein pressure gradient, indocyanine green extraction ratio, indocyanine green clearance, and antipyrine clearance as indices of portal pressure, intrahepatic shunting, hepatic blood flow and functional hepatocellular mass, respectively. Urinary sodium excretion in the cirrhotics correlated strongly with antipyrine clearance (r = 0.839, p less than 0.0001) and weakly with portal pressure (r = 0.562, p = 0.037). No correlation was seen with the other indices of hepatic blood flow and shunting. The findings of this study suggest that alcoholic cirrhosis is associated with a decline in hepatocellular function which results in either a decreased clearance of a salt-retaining hormone or decreased synthesis of a natriuretic hormone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, this has not been confirmed by other investigators. To compare the intensity and characteristics of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity in cirrhotic and normal rats, 31 rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis with ascites and 35 control rats were treated with gentamicin. Each group of rats was divided into two subgroups in order to receive 10 or 40 mg per kg per day of gentamicin, and different subsets of animals were killed on Days 4, 8 and 12 of treatment for renal histological examination and determination of renal tissue gentamicin concentration. Urine volume, osmolality, sodium excretion and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity were measured daily throughout the study. Creatinine clearance and trough plasma concentration of gentamicin were determined in each animal immediately before killing. There were no significant differences between cirrhotic and control rats in relation to the magnitude of changes in urine volume, osmolality, sodium excretion and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity and creatinine clearance during gentamicin administration. The values of a histopathological score semiquantitatively assessing the renal morphological changes observed by light microscopy were not significantly different in cirrhotic and control rats. In addition, similar trough plasma and renal cortical tissue concentrations of gentamicin were observed in both groups of animals. These results suggest that, in this experimental model, cirrhosis does not increase the risk for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.\r"

This study suggests that verapamil is of no beneficial effect in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver.\r"

Rats were maintained on cereal-based or purified diets in pellet form. All rats recovered preoperative body weights within the experimental periods; however, recovery of preoperative body weight was influenced by surgical technique and diet composition. Portacaval shunted rats fed a cereal-based diet required a longer period of time (14 days) to reattain preoperative body weights when compared to portacaval shunted rats fed a purified diet (7 days). Once preoperative body weight was recovered, growth rates of portacaval shunted rats were parallel to those of sham-operated controls. Rats with a suture-portacaval shunt appeared most sensitive to the feeding of a cereal-based diet. All portacaval shunted rats and sham controls fed a purified diet regained preoperative body weights within 7 days after surgery. Sham controls fed either a cereal-based or purified diet recovered preoperative body weights within an average of 4 days. Suture-portacaval shunted rats consuming a pellet form cereal-based diet showed a low feed efficiency which could be reversed by feeding a pellet form purified diet. Rats subjected to a nonsuture glue-portacaval shunt and fed a cereal-based diet showed 50% lower feed efficiencies than did glue-portacaval shunted rats fed a purified diet. Portacaval shunted rats decreased their consumption of cereal-based diets but not of purified diets postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven patients undergoing therapeutic sclerotherapy were studied by measuring wedged hepatic venous pressure, intravariceal pressure, free hepatic venous pressure, superior vena cava pressure and the intravascular pressure gradients wedged hepatic venous pressure-free hepatic venous pressure and intravariceal pressure-superior vena cava pressure, prior to and after vasopressin injection (1 IU, iv). Vasopressin caused a significant reduction in intravariceal pressure (from 22.5 +/- 9.4 to 19.2 +/- 8.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Measurement of wedged hepatic venous pressure and free hepatic venous pressure closely reflected the reduction in variceal pressure. Thus, wedged hepatic venous pressure decreased by 16 +/- 11%, which is close to the 14 +/- 7% change in intravariceal pressure, and the 23 +/- 12% fall in the pressure gradient wedged hepatic venous pressure-free hepatic venous pressure was mirrored by the 26 +/- 10% change in intravariceal pressure-superior vena cava pressure. These pressure gradients decreased more than the absolute pressures (intravariceal pressure and wedged hepatic venous pressure) due to concomitant increases in superior vena cava pressure (1.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg) and free hepatic venous pressure (0.6 +/- 1.9 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of three isolated defects in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids on the size and distribution of the bile acid pool, plasma bile acid levels and bile acid secretion into the intestine was simulated using a linear multicompartmental physiological pharmacokinetic model previously used to simulate these aspects of bile acid metabolism in healthy man. Stepwise increases in portal-systemic shunting (with a reciprocal decrease in hepatic blood flow) caused an exponential increase in systemic plasma concentrations of bile acids, but no other major changes in bile acid metabolism. When the effect of varying fractional hepatic extraction was simulated, it was found that the greater the fractional hepatic extraction, the greater the elevation observed for systemic plasma bile acid levels for a given degree of portal-systemic shunting. When total hepatic blood flow was restored to normal by simulating \"arterialization,\" systemic plasma levels of bile acids decreased strikingly, yet remained elevated. For cholate with a fractional hepatic extraction of 0.9 and 100% portal-systemic shunting, arterialization caused a decrease from a 20-fold elevation to a 5-fold elevation. This simulation thus defined the effect of the presence of the portal venous system per se on plasma bile acid levels and also quantified the circulatory route by which substances reach the liver when portal-systemic shunting is present. An isolated defect in hepatic uptake of bile acids caused little change in overall bile acid metabolism other than modestly increased plasma levels. Loss of bile acid storage by the gallbladder caused the majority of the bile acid pool to move from the gallbladder compartments to the proximal small intestine during fasting but had little effect on the dynamics of the enterohepatic circulation during eating. The results of these novel simulations of isolated defects in bile acid transport should aid in the interpretation of the more complex changes in bile acid metabolism which are likely to occur in hepatic or biliary disease.\r"

After the 2-week diet period a bile fistula was established and rates of taurocholate, tauromuricholate and taurochenodeoxycholate secretion were quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography. During the infusion experiments taurocholate production was calculated from the difference in specific activity of [14C]taurocholate between infusate and bile, whereas tauromuricholate and taurochenodeoxycholate synthesis was derived directly from their secretion rates after pool depletion. Both the 0.5% cholate and taurocholate diet suppressed tauromuricholate and taurochenodeoxycholate secretion nearly totally, but only cholate led to a prolonged inhibition taurocholate synthesis. The diets stimulated total bile acid secretion and expanded the total bile acid pool size 2- to 3-fold, but they also prompted a dramatic increase in the biliary secretion of taurodeoxycholate. In contrast, colectomized animals did not secrete taurodeoxycholate following the cholate diet and, despite a comparable increase in bile acid pool size, tauromuricholate and taurochenodeoxycholate secretion was inhibited to a lesser extent. In addition, the rate of bile acid secretion and synthesis was significantly enhanced when compared to that of intact rats. To determine whether taurocholate affected bile acid synthesis directly, the bile acid was infused intravenously or intraduodenally at varying rates up to 300 mumoles per kg per hr for 54 hr, i.e. a rate exceeding normal total bile acid secretion in these acute bile fistula animals nearly 3-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Changes in cystolic Ca++ activity were calculated from time-dependent changes in fluorescence of quin-2 loaded hepatocytes. Release of lactate dehydrogenase and changes in propodium iodide fluorescence were used to assess cell viability. Bile acids studied were unconjugated and taurine-conjugated cholate, chenodeoxycholate (and taurochenodeoxycholate), deoxycholate (and taurodeoxycholate) and lithocholate (and taurolithocholate). With the exception of cholate and taurocholate, bile acids increased cystolic Ca++ activity within 10 to 30 sec in a concentration-dependent fashion (0.05 to 1.0 mM) and in the order lithocholate = taurolithocholate greater than chenodeoxycholate = taurochenodeoxycholate = deoxycholate = taurodeoxycholate. The initial increase in cystolic Ca++ activity by bile acids was not due to cell damage, since bile acid-induced decreases in cell viability were not significant until 2 to 3 min. At higher concentrations of unconjugated bile acid, there was a secondary increase in quin-2 fluorescence corresponding temporally to the increase in propodium iodide fluorescence, indicating cell damage after the initial increase in cystolic Ca++ activity. The ability of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids to increase cystolic Ca++ activity was abolished and decreased (60 to 90%), respectively, in the absence of extracellular Ca++, indicating that extracellular Ca++ is the major source of the bile acid-induced increase in cystolic Ca++ activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bile acid synthesis is believed to be regulated by bile salts returning to the liver via the portal vein and suppressing cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway. In order to characterize the relative effectiveness of bile salts in regulating bile acid synthesis, seven different bile acids were administered (1% w/w in chow) to rats over a 14-day period. Biliary bile salt composition was determined from bile samples obtained prior to killing; in all cases, the fed bile acid became the predominant bile salt in bile. The specific activities of microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, HMG-CoA reductase and acylconenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase were determined after killing. Hydrophilic bile salts (ursocholic, hyocholic, ursodeoxycholic and hyodeoxycholic) did not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase or cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities. By contrast, more hydrophobic bile salts (cholic, chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic) inhibited the activities of these two enzymes in order of increasing hydrophobicity. Neither hydrophobic nor hydrophilic bile salts inhibited acylcoenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase activity. No consistent effect of bile acid feeding on total microsomal cholesterol was observed. Based on the results of these studies, we propose that the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance of the bile acid pool may play an important role in the regulation of bile acid synthesis. We postulate that the activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and HMG-CoA reductase may be regulated by hydrophobic bile acid-induced changes in the lipid composition and physicochemical properties (fluidity) of the microsomal membranes to which both of these rate-limiting enzymes are attached.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The Na+ ionophoretic capability of various purified phospholipids and the modulating effects of bile acids and phosphatidylcholine was examined by: (a) measurement of 22Na+ partition into the organic phase (chloroform) of a two-phase system and (b) direct measurement of the translocation of 22Na+ across a bulk chloroform phase separating two aqueous phases in a Pressman cell. All phospholipids tested, except for phosphatidylcholine, showed ionophoretic capability for Na+ at micromolar concentrations. Cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine were the most efficient Na+ carriers, comparable with monensin, an established Na+ ionophore. In contrast, cholic acid as well as other bile acids demonstrated only marginal or no Na+ ionophoretic capability. However, hydroxylated bile acids (particularly cholic acid), sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100, which can induce and stabilize inverted structures in lipid membranes, were able to increase 5- to 8-fold the phospholipid-mediated Na+ transport. Interaction of cardiolipin with Na+ in the chloroform phase followed a rectangular hyperbolic function with an apparent Kd within the physiological Na+ concentration range (16.9 +/- 5.1 mM). Addition of cholic acid to the cardiolipin-containing organic phase resulted in a 10-fold increase of maximal Na+ uptake and no change in apparent Kd. The effect of cholic acid on both cardiolipin-mediated Na+ partition and Na+ translocation across the chloroform phase showed a marked dependence on pH, being greater at pH 7.4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty gallbladder biles and 12 hepatic biles from patients with gallstones as well as 16 model biles were examined. The nucleation times (days) of the biles as well as their isolated vesicular and micellar fractions were determined and their lipid composition was analyzed. In 41 of 46 comparisons, cholesterol nucleated faster from vesicles than micelles; in only one case was the opposite found. The mean (+/- S.D.) nucleation times of vesicles and micelles in gallbladder biles were 8.9 +/- 5.4 vs. 15.4 +/- 8.6, in hepatic biles 14.6 +/- 9.4 vs. 20.6 +/- 9.1, and in model biles 9.0 +/- 3.7 vs. 18.9 +/- 9.1 days, respectively. All these differences were significant (p less than 0.005). Gallbladder biles (n = 7) devoid of vesicles nucleated more slowly (9.0 +/- 9.5 days), as compared to gallbladder biles (n = 13) containing vesicles (3.8 +/- 2.2 days). The nucleation time of gallbladder and hepatic biles was significantly correlated with the nucleation time of the vesicles from these biles (r = 0.847, p less than 0.05). There was no correlation with the nucleation time of micelles from the same biles. The percentage of cholesterol carried by vesicles in bile was positively correlated to the molar percentage of biliary cholesterol and the cholesterol saturation index and negatively correlated to the molar percentage of bile salts. Our data suggest that phospholipid vesicles are the major vehicle for cholesterol precipitation in bile as well as an important determinant of the nucleation time of bile.\r"

In this study, we completely solubilized and then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography specimens of black pigment gallstones from eight nb/nb mice with hereditary hemolytic anemia. Each dried gallstone specimen of about 200 micrograms was dissolved in 5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide/0.15 M HCI/50 mM disodium-EDTA (8:1:1 by volume) at room temperature. Stone dissolution was complete by 30 min as monitored by the A456 and direct observation, and no oxidative products of bilirubin were observed in the visible spectrum, 350 to 750 nm. By high-performance liquid chromatography, the intact tetrapyrroles were separated as diconjugated and monoconjugated bilirubins; unconjugated bilirubin was resolved as XIII, IX and III alpha-isomers. The isocratic solvent system used was 0.1 M di-n-dodecylamine acetate/0.1 M di-n-octylamine acetate (4:1, v/v) in methanol, pH 7.4, at a flow of 1 ml per min. Diconjugated bilirubin accounted for 6.0 +/- 2.4 molar % (mean +/- S.E.), monoconjugated bilirubin for 37.4 +/- 8.4% and unconjugated bilirubin for 56.3 +/- 8.9% of the solubilized pigments. The IX alpha-isomer represented 96 +/- 1.9% of the unconjugated bilirubin. The presence of bilirubin conjugates in gallstones was confirmed by ethylanthranilate diazotization: the conjugated azodipyrrole in stone had the same retention time as that of conjugated azodipyrrole from rat and mouse bile. A majority of the bilirubin conjugates was sensitive to beta-glucuronidase of liver origin, indicating that the C-1 glucuronide ester was present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A Dornier lithotripter and an upper limit of 1,500 discharges were employed. Although computed tomography density was significantly lower in cholesterol stones than in the noncholesterol stones (p less than 0.0001) and although the latter were significantly more often radiopaque (p less than 0.0001), we found no clear-cut correlation between the cholesterol content or computed tomography density and the degree of fragmentation of the stones. The most important variable which limited successful disintegration was the total stone volume. In stones with a mean total volume of 0.83 ml +/- 0.25 S.E. (diameter for single stones = 11.5 +/- 0.9 mm), none of the fragments exceeded 2 mm, whereas in stones with a mean volume of 3.6 ml +/- 0.64 (diameter = 17.2 +/- 1.5 mm) at least one fragment larger than 2 mm remained (p less than 0.002). Under the in vitro conditions, fragmentation was similar in multiple and solitary stones, provided the volume of the stones was comparable. These data show that, in general, the number and size of the stones, i.e. their total volume, and much less significantly their chemical composition are the major determinants of fragmentation by extracorporeal shock waves.\r"

Angiotensinogen mRNA in rat aorta was localized in the adventitia and surrounding adipose tissue, and not in the vascular smooth muscle. Freshly dispersed and cultured endothelial and aortic smooth muscle cells did not contain detectable amounts of angiotensinogen mRNA. In addition to periaortic adipose tissue, angiotensinogen mRNA was present in other fat depots of both brown and white types. To examine regulation of angiotensinogen gene expression, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or underwent bilateral nephrectomy. Relative levels of angiotensinogen mRNA in brown adipose tissues increased dramatically by 48 hours after bilateral nephrectomy. However, only one source of brown adipose tissue showed increased angiotensinogen mRNA levels after animals were treated for 5 days with converting enzyme inhibitor. In addition, angiotensinogen was released into the medium from incubated adipose tissues with levels increasing over a 2-hour period. These results demonstrate that angiotensinogen is synthesized by adipose tissue in the rat and may play a role in the function of this tissue.\r"

The extracorporeal perfusion circuit was arranged so that the perfusion pressure to the normotensive recipient kidney could be varied from 90 to 200 mm Hg without any change in total flow through this circuit. This setup avoided hemodynamic or mechanical interferences with reflexogenic circulatory control in the normotensive donor rat when the recipient kidney was manipulated. Diuresis and natriuresis were measured in the normotensive donor rat and the normotensive recipient kidney. A few minutes after normotensive recipient kidney perfusion pressure had been raised, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate started to decline rapidly in the normotensive donor rat, and circulatory collapse ensued within 15 to 100 minutes. During the control period at 90 mm Hg normotensive recipient kidney perfusion pressure, urinary flow, MAP and heart rate were stable in the normotensive donor rat and the normotensive recipient kidney. When perfusion pressure was raised to 200 mm Hg in the recipient kidney, the urinary flow in the donor rat increased 62% on average in the first 10 minutes over values recorded before the pressure rise (p less than 0.05) while MAP simultaneously fell by 16% and HR remained unchanged. During the subsequent period, the urinary flow of the donor rat declined together with MAP and heart rate. In the extracorporeally high-pressure perfused recipient kidneys, an eightfold to ninefold increase in diuresis and natriuresis occurred during the first 45 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three days after chemical lesion of the nucleus ambiguus with kainic acid, arterial pressure and heart rate were unchanged; however, subsequent sinoaortic deafferentation produced a significantly greater increase of arterial pressure (157 +/- 7 vs 132 +/- 5 mm Hg) and heart rate (436 +/- 10 vs 374 +/- 10 beats/min) compared with those produced by sham lesion. Glutamate injected into the nucleus ambiguus increased arterial pressure and heart rate at 20 nmol/100 nl and decreased heart rate at 50 nmol/100 nl. Glutamate injected into the C1 area increased arterial pressure and heart rate at both doses. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid at 50 nmol/100 nl produced bradycardia and a fall in arterial pressure when injected into both the nucleus ambiguus and C1 area. The heart rate responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate were attenuated in sinoaortic-deafferentated rats. The nucleus ambiguus and the C1 region were mapped using electrical stimulation with microelectrodes. All points stimulated in three anteroposterior sections in the nucleus ambiguus and the C1 area produced increases in arterial pressure, whereas bradycardia was restricted to the middle of three lateral coordinates associated with the center of the nucleus ambiguus and the C1 area ventral to the nucleus ambiguus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements of heart rate, mean blood pressure, minute ventilation, and sympathetic nerve activity to muscle were made before and during hypoxia. We also measured responses to a period of voluntary apnea during hypoxia. There were no significant differences between the increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and ventilation in response to hypoxia in the two groups. However, during hypoxia sympathetic activity in the hypertensive subjects increased by 40.6 +/- 13.6% (mean +/- SE), greater than the increase of 20.4 +/- 5.0% in the control subjects (p less than 0.05). In six hypertensive and six control subjects, when apnea was performed during hypoxia, sympathetic activity increased by 605.0 +/- 294.3% in the hypertensive subjects and by only 52.8 +/- 17.3% in the control subjects (p less than 0.001). We conclude that the chemoreceptor reflex is enhanced in borderline hypertensive subjects and results in exaggerated increases in sympathetic nerve activity during hypoxia. This enhanced chemoreceptor reflex is especially obvious when the inhibitory influence of breathing and thoracic afferent activity is eliminated by apnea. This exaggerated response may contribute to excess sympathetic activity in borderline hypertensive subjects and to adverse consequences of sleep apnea in hypertensive subjects.\r"

  ".W": "In a search for additional Ca2+ regulatory components in vascular smooth muscle, a novel troponin T-like protein was purified from bovine aorta smooth muscle. The isolated protein was separated into several isoforms on isoelectric focusing. The major isoelectric variants were focused in the pH region of 8.4 to 9.1. The protein had slightly different molecular masses in the Mr range of 35,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its molar ratio relative to tropomyosin in the muscle extract was estimated to be 0.9:1.0. The novel protein bound to the immobilized calmodulin and exhibited a number of common physicochemical properties with gizzard (Mr = 34,000) calmodulin-binding and F-actin-binding protein. The aorta and gizzard proteins were immunologically cross-reactive. Both proteins shared a common antigenic determinant with COOH-terminal segments of rabbit skeletal and bovine cardiac troponin T and bound to the immobilized smooth muscle tropomyosin. Both proteins interacted with rabbit skeletal troponin C in the presence and absence of Ca2+, but they did not interact with troponin I. These results suggest that the novel protein, which is designated calponin, may be a specialized component of smooth muscle thin filament involved in the regulation of contractile apparatus.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine whether significant shifts occur in the coupling between receptors and the production of putative second messengers. Measures of [3H]myo-inositol phosphates in aorta (endothelium removed) exhibited a concentration-dependent increase to norepinephrine, with the 50% response shifted significantly to the left in the hypertensive group (7.0 +/- 0.9 X 10(-7) M in 8 control rats vs 1.1 +/- 0.2 X 10(-7) M in 8 hypertensive rats; p less than 0.001). The production of [32P]phosphatidic acid was also shifted (6.5 +/- 2.5 X 10(-7) M in 16 control vs 1.9 +/- 0.8 X 10(-7) M in 12 hypertensive rats; p less than 0.05). The functional responses of 42K efflux and contraction to norepinephrine were also significantly shifted threefold to 15-fold in the hypertensive group (p less than 0.001), but the 50% response typically occurred at a 10 to 100 times lower concentration than that for the production of myo-inositol phosphates and phosphatidic acid. The amplification between receptor occupancy and functional responses apparently occurs beyond the production of phosphoinositide metabolites. The fivefold shift in the 50% response of biochemical end points for the hypertensive group accounted for most of the shift (sixfold) in the functional end points.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hemodynamic and renin release measurements were compared in a control group of nine anesthetized rabbits and in a group of 10 rabbits given verapamil (200 micrograms/kg i.v. initially, 4 micrograms/kg/min thereafter), starting 30 minutes before data collection. Measurements were made over a range of controlled renal perfusion pressure from 100 to 40 mm Hg. The renal blood flow at 100 mm Hg of the verapamil-treated group was 18% greater (p less than 0.02) than that of the control group, while the glomerular filtration rate was 51% greater (p less than 0.001) than that of the control group. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate autoregulation were highly effective in the control group down to 80 mm Hg, but both variables were poorly regulated in the verapamil-treated group. The filtration fraction of the treated group was 36.9 +/- 1.5% versus 28.5 +/- 1.6% in the control group (p less than 0.003) at 100 mm Hg, and the filtration fraction of the treated group remained significantly greater down to 40 mm Hg. Renin release rates of the two groups were similar at the 100 mm Hg pressure level, but the increase in release due to the progressive reduction in perfusion pressure was significantly greater in the treated group than in the control group. At the 80 mm Hg pressure level, the mean release rate for the treated group was more than three times greater (p less than 0.05) than that of the control group. These findings demonstrate that verapamil is an effective renal vasodilator and that the effect is proportionally greater on the preglomerular than on the postglomerular resistance. This action could be the basis for its antihypertensive efficacy.\r"

Since exogenously administered adenosine may increase renal blood flow by direct vasodilation, inhibition of renin release, or prejunctional interruption of adrenergic neurotransmission, these studies examined whether endogenous intrarenal adenosine maintains renal blood flow distal to renal arterial stenosis. Administration of theophylline, which blocks the direct vasodilating effect of adenosine and antagonizes the inhibitory effect of adenosine on renin release and sympathetic neurotransmission, resulted in marked renal vasoconstriction in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive animals. This theophylline-induced renal vasoconstriction was markedly attenuated by angiotensin II blockade with saralasin and was unchanged by renal denervation or beta 1-adrenergic blockade with atenolol. These findings indicate that the marked renal vasoconstriction in one-kidney, one clip hypertension during theophylline administration is mainly mediated by angiotensin II, is to a lesser degree due to inhibition of adenosine-induced vasodilation, and is independent of sympathetic influences. These data suggest that endogenous interstitial adenosine preserves renal blood flow in one-kidney, one clip hypertension mainly by inhibiting renin release.\r"

The relationships between whole kidney, cortical and papillary blood flows, and renal perfusion pressure were compared in 3- to 5-, 6- to 9-, and 12- to 16-week-old SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Cortical and papillary blood flows were similar in the different age groups of SHR and WKY over most of the range of perfusion pressure studied. Control papillary blood flows, determined at a renal perfusion pressure equal to the mean arterial pressure of each animal, were not significantly different in the 3- to 5- and 12- to 16-week-old SHR in comparison to values observed in age-matched WKY. In contrast, the control papillary blood flow was 30% lower in 6- to 9-week-old SHR in comparison to the value observed in WKY. Papillary blood flows were significantly less in all age groups of SHR than the corresponding flows measured in WKY when they were compared at equivalent renal perfusion pressures. These findings indicate that medullary vascular resistance is elevated even in very young SHR and suggest that alterations in vasa recta hemodynamics may participate in the development of hypertension by shifting the pressure-natriuresis relationship toward higher pressures.\r"

In this study, the effect of electrolytic ablation of the area postrema on blood pressure and vascular reactivity in DOC-salt-treated rats was examined. Four treatment groups of rats were studied (n = 5 in each): area postrema lesion, DOC-salt (DOC pivalate, 5 mg/wk s.c. for 5 weeks); sham lesion, DOC-salt; area postrema lesion, control; and sham lesion, control. Helically cut strips of carotid artery, aorta, and mesenteric artery were prepared for isometric force recording. Area postrema lesion attenuated hypertension in DOC-salt rats (mean arterial pressure, 107 vs 123 mm Hg in area postrema lesion and sham lesion rats, respectively; chronic aortic catheter). Vascular strips from sham lesion-control rats. These changes in vascular reactivity also were observed in area postrema lesion-DOC-salt rats. DOC treatment in rats on a normal sodium intake did not result in hypertension or increased vascular reactivity. In summary, integrity of the area postrema is necessary for hypertension but not for changes in vascular reactivity, in DOC-salt rats. It appears that 1) changes in vascular reactivity may be necessary, but they are not sufficient to produce DOC-salt hypertension, and 2) if these vascular changes are secondary to a central nervous system effect, they are mediated by a pathway distinct from the area postrema.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that these two types of vagal afferents mediate different reflex sympathetic nerve responses. We compared effects of stimulation of chemosensitive and mechanosensitive vagal afferents on renal and adrenal sympathetic nerve activity in rats. In anesthetized, sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated rats, we measured arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal and adrenal sympathetic nerve activity during intrapericardial administration of phenyl diguanide as a stimulus for chemosensitive afferents and during volume expansion and acute occlusion of the ascending aorta as stimuli for mechanosensitive afferents. Stimulation of chemosensitive afferents with phenyl diguanide (3, 10, and 30 micrograms/kg intrapericardially) caused decreases in renal sympathetic nerve activity (-36 +/- 5, -52 +/- 11, and -71 +/- 5%; p less than 0.01) and in arterial pressure and heart rate but increased adrenal sympathetic nerve activity (+14 +/- 27, +63 +/- 21, and +83 +/- 28%; p less than 0.05). These responses were abolished by vagotomy. Intrapericardial injection of saline vehicle did not change renal and adrenal sympathetic nerve activity. In contrast to the effects of phenyl diguanide, activation of mechanosensitive afferents by volume expansion with intravenous infusion of 6% dextran in 0.9% saline (Dextran 75) decreased both renal and adrenal sympathetic nerve activity. Stimulation of mechanosensitive afferents by acute occlusion of the ascending aorta also decreased both renal and adrenal sympathetic nerve activity. These results indicate that chemosensitive and mechanosensitive cardiac vagal afferents produce different reflex responses: Chemosensitive afferents increase and mechanosensitive afferents decrease adrenal sympathetic outflow.\r"

Horizontally oriented slices (300 micron) containing the area postrema, nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus were perifused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The effects of microdrop application of Ang II and its antagonist [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II on spontaneous firing rate were determined in 27 extracellularly recorded neurons. Ang II substantially increased the firing rate of 13 neurons located in the medial NTS, but it did not alter the spontaneous activity of the remaining 14 neurons. In most cases Ang II elicited a slowly developing, prolonged excitatory response. The effects of both Ang II and [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II were tested in 13 neurons. [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II produced a short latency, brief excitation in three neurons, marked inhibition of spontaneous firing in two cells, and no effect on the other eight neurons. Administration of [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II blocked the excitatory effects of subsequent administration of Ang II in three neurons. To our knowledge, these observations provide the first evidence for direct actions of both Ang II and [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II on neurons in the canine NTS and for the specificity of the neuronal effects of Ang II as documented by blockade of the excitatory response to Ang II by [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II.\r"

The present study was therefore undertaken in patients with essential hypertension to investigate the possible role of an intracellular calcium-dependent mechanism in salt sensitivity. The difference in mean blood pressure between a week of low sodium chloride diet (3 g/day) and a week of high sodium chloride diet (20 g/day) was studied in relation to the intracellular free calcium concentration in lymphocytes and an acute hypotensive response to a 10-mg sublingual dose of nifedipine in 12 inpatients. Sodium chloride loading induced significant increases in mean blood pressure (from 111 +/- 12 to 122 +/- 11 mm Hg; p less than 0.01), intracellular free calcium in lymphocytes (from 133 +/- 13 to 145 +/- 9 nmol/L; p less than 0.01), and the hypotensive response to nifedipine (from 19 +/- 6 to 31 +/- 10 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). In addition, serum total calcium concentration was decreased while urinary calcium excretion was increased. The elevation of mean blood pressure was closely and positively correlated with the increase in intracellular free calcium concentration (r = 0.71, p less than 0.05) and the increase in the hypotensive effect of nifedipine (r = 0.91, p less than 0.01) after sodium chloride loading. However, changes in these values had no relation to the change in serum concentration or urinary excretion of calcium. These data suggest that change in the cellular calcium-dependent vasoconstriction mechanism may be associated with salt sensitivity of patients with essential hypertension.\r"

A similar dose of aldosterone was infused subcutaneously for 12 days. Aldosterone infused intracerebroventricularly increased blood pressure significantly in both salt-replete and salt-depleted dogs. In salt-replete animals the hypertension was associated with increased total peripheral resistance without concomitant changes in blood volume, cardiac output, or in any of the neurohumoral parameters measured. We conclude that this type of hypertension is resistance-mediated from its outset and appears to be relatively independent of salt and water retention. The mechanism by which intracerebroventricularly administered aldosterone increases vascular resistance remains to be determined.\r"

On the basis of Orem's self-care framework, subjects' levels of knowledge in six criterion areas were assessed according to measurement criteria developed by Horn and Swain. Fifty-one subjects from the total population of MI patients admitted to the coronary care unit of the study hospital during the period of research who met study criteria were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Statistically significant differences (p less than 0.05) were found in the knowledge level of the experimental group in the areas of the disease, its effects, related self-care measures, recommended exercises, and all teaching areas together. Although significant differences were not found in the teaching areas of therapeutic diet, medications, physical activity restrictions, and recommended rest, a higher mean was produced for the experimental group in all but one area. These findings demonstrate that a telephone teaching program for MI patients 6 to 8 weeks after hospital discharge can be effective in increasing knowledge relative to the disease, self-care, and therapeutic regimen.\r"

A sample of 22 hospitalized patients were interviewed, with use of an open-ended question and the Caring Behaviors Assessment, to determine what things nurses said or did that conveyed caring to the patients during their stay in the coronary care unit (CCU). An analysis of the relative importance of each identified behavior revealed that nursing actions that focused on the physical care and monitoring of patients were seen as most indicative of caring. Teaching activities were also perceived as significant whereas extra, individualized aspects of care were viewed as less important in the critical care setting. No significant differences in perceptions were found on the basis of sex, age, education level, number of CCU admissions, or length of CCU stay. Critical care nurses should be aware that assessment activities and demonstration of professional competence are viewed by patients as significant expressions of caring.\r"

  ".W": "The spectrum of psychologic distress in patients with serious heart rhythm disturbances (HRD) has not been well defined. A survey of personal and clinical background data and general psychologic status was made of 136 patients with serious HRD defined as sustained or symptomatic ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Two questionnaires were used: the SCL-90-R, a standard self-report symptom inventory of present psychologic status, and a functional capacity and occupational status questionnaire developed by us. Of the 105 respondents, 89 completed both questionnaires, the results of which form the basis of this report. The patients with HRD were found to have significantly elevated SCL-90-R scores reflective of an increase in overall psychologic distress (Global Severity Index, Positive Symptom Distress Index, and Positive Symptom Total) as well as significantly higher scores on the specific constructs. Within the HRD population, univariate analysis revealed three variables significantly correlated with increased psychologic distress: (1) requiring long-term antiarrhythmic medication, (2) being forced to modify work status, and (3) having more advanced cardiac impairment. Patients who had two or more of these variables, termed risk factors, reported significantly more symptoms and greater psychologic distress than those with zero or one risk factor. We conclude that patients with serious HRD have greater psychologic distress than do normal subjects. Within the HRD group, patients requiring long-term medical treatment for their arrhythmia, those forced to modify work status, and those with more advanced cardiac impairment are at greater risk for emotional sequelae, and patients with two or more of the identified risk factors are more likely to have elevated psychologic distress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their personality factors tended to be aggressive, assertive, competitive, persevering, moralistic, resourceful, and mechanical. The nurses who enjoyed the field most were of the androgynous or masculine type and had high levels of self-esteem. On the basis of these findings, the nurse recruiter or faculty member doing career counseling could assess the personality characteristics, gender identity, and self-esteem levels of interested nurses. The goal would be to identify nurses who would both enjoy the field and remain active in critical care nursing after orientation. The goal could also be to help nurses dissatisfied with critical care nursing to seek means of improving their self-esteem.\r"

The needs of the children may be neglected. To reduce the long-term negative effects of the crisis event on the life of the child, appropriate interventions should be made at the time of the crisis. It is important for nurses to recall emotional and cognitive phases of growth and development when counseling parents. This information is used to help the nonhospitalized parent identify the needs of the child. The nurse can act as a resource person for this parent in planning strategies that will prevent or alleviate problems for the child.\r"

Twelve cyclophosphamide-treated and 12 control animals comprising each group were studied physiologically before and 2 h after a single 10-min exposure to 3 ppm of TDI. Reactivity was determined in intact unanesthetized animals by measuring specific airway conductance before and during intravenous acetylcholine infusion. After testing, tracheal tissue for light microscopic examination was obtained from three hyperreactive guinea pigs in each exposed group and compared with tissue from treated and control animals (n = 3 each) that had not been TDI exposed. Cyclophosphamide treatment caused substantial decreases in both circulating and airway granulocyte counts. However, the incidence and degree of bronchial hyperreactivity that occurred 2 h post-TDI was similar in the untreated and treated groups. Our results indicate that TDI-induced bronchial hyperreactivity 1) occurs shortly after a brief high concentration exposure and 2) appears independent of circulating or airway granulocyte counts.\r"

A pseudorandom noise pressure wave was produced at the nostrils of the animals by means of a loudspeaker adapted to the nose by a tightly fitting mask. A Fourier analysis of the pressure in the nostrils and flow signals yielded mean Rrs and Xrs, over 16 s, at frequencies of 2-26 Hz. A good correlation was found between values of pulmonary resistances measured by the isovolume method at the respiratory frequency of animals and values obtained at a frequency of 6 Hz by use of our technique. The linearity of the respiratory system, the reproducibility of the technique, and the effects of upper airways on results have been studied. In healthy calves, Rrs increases with frequency. Mean resonant frequency is 7.5 Hz. Bronchospasm was induced in six calves by administration of intravenous organophosphates. Rrs tended to decrease with increasing frequency. Resonant frequency exceeded 26 Hz. All parameters returned to initial values after administration of atropine. In healthy calves, atropine produces a decrease in Rrs, especially at low frequencies. Values of resonant frequency are not modified.\r"

When inflated, the two balloons isolate a segment of trachea, which is perfused through Silastic tubes using a peristaltic pump. After instilling a chemotactic agent, the perfusate is sampled periodically to permit characterization of the chemotactic response. We anesthetized four mongrel dogs and ventilated them mechanically through the double-balloon catheter. Two mediators, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and 8S,15S-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (8,15-diHETE) were tested in each dog by perfusing the trachea with each mediator in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing ethanol and antibiotics. Aliquots were removed for differential cell counts at fixed time intervals over a 4-h period. Control experiments performed in each dog with the identical concentrations of ethanol and antibiotics in HBSS showed no cellular response before 180 min. At 240 min, the cell counts were 86 +/- 28 (SE) granulocytes/microliter (n = 4). In contrast, both LTB4 and 8,15-diHETE gave a significant cellular response at 120 min (309 +/- 125 and 141 +/- 41 granulocytes/microliter, respectively; P less than 0.05) but did not differ significantly from each other. These results suggest that both LTB4 and 8,15-diHETE can incite inflammatory responses in the dog trachea in vivo. Furthermore, the double-balloon catheter technique promises to be a useful in vivo chemotaxis assay.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the influence of lung volume on the ability of normal subjects to sustain breathing against inspiratory resistive loading. Four normal subjects breathed on a closed circuit in which inspiration was loaded by a flow resistor. Subjects were assigned a series of breathing tasks over a range of pressures and flows. In each task there was a specified resistor and also targets for either mean esophageal or airway opening pressure, respiratory frequency, and duty cycle. Endurance was assessed as the length of time to failure of the assigned task. The prime experimental variable was lung volume, which was increased by approximately 1 liter during some tasks; 8 cmH2O continuous positive airway pressure was applied to increase lung volume without increasing elastic load. As previously shown (McCool et al.J. Appl. Physiol. 60: 299-303, 1986), for tasks that could be sustained for the same time, there was an inverse linear relationship of mean esophageal pressure with inspiratory flow rate. This trade-off of pressure and flow was apparent both with and without the increase of lung volume. Comparable tasks, however, could not be sustained as long at the higher lung volumes. This effect of volume on endurance was greater for tasks characterized by high inspiratory pressures and low flow rates than for tasks that could be sustained for the same time but that had lower inspiratory pressures and higher flow rates. This is probably due to the effects of shortening of the sarcomere on fatiguability. Increased lung volume, per se, may contribute to respiratory failure because of increased inspiratory muscle fatiguability by mechanisms independent of elastic load.\r"

Several factors contributed to our evaluation of the CVC-Tes relationship during work. Laser-Doppler velocimetry (LDF) provided a continuous measure of SkBF that is not influenced by underlying muscle blood flow. Local warming to 39 degrees C at the site of measurement of SkBF provided a consistent skin temperature and facilitated observation of changes in LDF. Mean arterial pressure was measured noninvasively once per minute to calculate CVC. Supine exercise minimized baroreceptor-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction. Our major finding was that the internal temperature at which CVC began to rise during exercise (CVC threshold) was graded with work load beyond 125 W (P less than 0.05). In that range the CVC threshold increased by 0.16 degrees C for every increment of 25 W. The CVC threshold was never reached at the highest work load in three of the four subjects. There was no consistent effect of work load on the slope of the CVC-Tes relationship or on the internal temperature at which sweating began during exercise (sweat rate threshold). We conclude that the level of work beyond 125 W affects the CVC-Tes relationship in a graded fashion, principally through shifts in threshold.\r"

Resting energy expenditure was found to be elevated by an average of 0.45 MJ/24 h [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26-0.64, t = 4.91, P less than 0.001] (108 kcal/24 h), or 9.2% above expected values derived from the regression relating resting energy expenditure to whole body weight and sex in control subjects.

The increased values were found to be independent of age, sex, or body size. There were significant correlations between increased values and poor pulmonary function as measured by the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity (r = -0.44, P less than 0.05) and subclinical infection as indicated by the blood leukocyte count (r = 0.40, P less than 0.05). However, the correlations were low, suggesting that other factors may contribute to the increased resting energy expenditure, possibly including the putative metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis.\r"

After ipratropium and propranolol, voluntary coughing alone decreased Rrs by 25 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05). We next investigated whether these bronchodilator responses could be blocked by anesthesia of the airways with inhaled lidocaine. After inhalation of lidocaine and LTD4, capsaicin aerosol induced coughing and a transient increase in Rrs of 18 +/- 6% (P less than 0.05) but no bronchodilation. Inhalation of saline-ethanol (n = 4) and a deep inhalation (n = 6) decreased Rrs by 18 +/- 4% (P less than 0.05) and 34 +/- 3% (P less than 0.001), respectively. We conclude that in normal subjects a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic bronchodilator mechanism exists, which can be activated by inhalation of capsaicin and inhibited by local anesthesia.\r"

In 14 anesthesized dogs, sufficient acid was given to one lung to double shunt fraction (Qs/Qt) from 14.2 +/- 0.8 to 32.4 +/- 2.6% (SE). This resulted in a significant decrease in Po2 from 495 +/- 9 to 136 +/- 21 Torr, cardiac output from 2.47 +/- 0.27 to 1.46 +/- 0.15 1/min, and blood pressure from 139 +/- 3 to 116 +/- 5 mmHg and a significant rise in pulmonary arterial pressure from 9.6 +/- 0.8 to 14.9 +/- 0.8 mmHg. After acid instillation, microsphere distribution to the injured lung segments decreased to 50% of the base-line value. At the same time, microsphere distribution in the normal segments increased to 160% of base line. In 7 of the 14 dogs the effects of naloxone (1 mg/kg) given after lung injury were compared with the other 7 animals that were given saline. Naloxone administration caused a significant redistribution of regional pulmonary perfusion such that microsphere distribution in the injured lung segments increased by a factor of 2 at 35 min compared with the animals given saline. Consistent with this finding, Qs/Qt in the naloxone group increased to 34.7 +/- 5.0% at 35 min, whereas that of the saline group decreased to 28.2 +/- 2.5%. The difference between the two groups was significant at 35 min. These changes occurred without further alterations in cardiac output, pulmonary arterial pressure, or systemic blood pressure in either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our aim was to investigate effects of aminophylline on VD and VM ECF acid-base variables. We used aminophylline because it inhibits adenosine, which is released within the brain during hypoxemia and could mediate VD. Experiments were performed in seven cats with acute bilateral denervation of carotid sinus nerves and vagi. Cats were anesthetized with chloralose-urethan and breathed spontaneously at a regulated and elevated arterial PCO2 (PaCO2). Measurements were made during normoxemia, hypoxemia, and recovery before (phase I) and after (phase II) aminophylline. By use of strict criteria for definition of VD, during phase II two kinds of responses were observed. Aminophylline prevented VD in five cats. In these cats in phase I, with mean arterial PO2 (PaO2) = 105 and PaCO2 = 42.2 Torr, VM ECF PCO2, [H+], and [HCO3-] were 59.5 +/- 8.6 Torr (mean +/- SD), 60.2 +/- 9.4 neq/l, and 23.1 +/- 3.7 meq/l, respectively. When mean PaO2 dropped to 49 Torr, ventilation decreased 21%, with only small changes in VM ECF acid-base variables. Studies were repeated 30 min after aminophylline (17 mg/kg iv). In phase II, during normoxemia (PaO2 = 110 Torr) VM ECF Pco2, [H+], and [HCO3-] were 55.4 +/- 8.1 Torr, 62.0 +/- 8.0 neq/l and 20.7 +/- 2.5 meq/l, respectively.

Therefore we designed this study to investigate whether breathing dry air is capable of causing structural changes of the airways mucosa. Anesthetized guinea pigs breathed spontaneously through a tracheostomy either dry (n = 15) or water-saturated (n = 12) air at approximately 38 degrees C for 30 or 60 min, during which time total pulmonary resistance (TPR) was measured. Immediately afterward, the animals were killed and the lungs and airways were prepared for histological examination (light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy). With dry as well as humid air, there was no change in TPR or in the structure of the main bronchi and lung parenchyma. With humid air the tracheal mucosa was normal in six guinea pigs and exhibited minor changes of the ciliae in eight and localized epithelial damage on light microscopy in the remaining animal. With dry air we found widespread loss of the ciliae on scanning electron microscopy in 10 of 12 animals, associated with detachment or sloughing of the epithelium, subepithelial vascular congestion, edema, and cellular infiltration on light microscopy. Our data demonstrate that a short exposure of the trachea to dry air causes marked epithelial lesions and local inflammation.\r"

CO breathing was used to induce hypoxia because CO causes tissue hypoxia with no or minimal chemoreceptor stimulation. An inspired gas mixture of 0.25 to 0.5% CO in air was used to raise the blood carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) progressively from 0 to 60% over approximately 20 min. The study, conducted in awake conscious lambs aged 2 and 10 days, consisted in measuring the response of ventilation and the change in arterial blood gases during the rise of HbCO. The results showed that the 2- and 10-day-old lambs tolerated very high HbCO levels without an increase in minute ventilation (VE) and without metabolic acidosis. At both ages, HbCO caused no VE change until HbCO levels rose to between 45 and 50% after which the VE change was exponential in some animals but minimal in others. The VE change was brought about by a rise in tidal volume and respiratory frequency. During the period of maturation from 2 to 10 days, there was a small shift to the right in the VE-HbCO response. In the 10-day-old lambs the VE response to high HbCO was greater than that of the 2-day-olds because of the lambs' higher respiratory frequency response. Six of the 10-day-old lambs but only two of the 2-day-old lambs showed a hypoxic tachypnea to HbCO of 55-65%. None of the lambs developed periodic breathing, dysrhythmic breathing, or recurrent apneas with an HbCO level as high as 60%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean ventilatory response (delta VE/delta PETCO2, where VE is minute ventilation and PETCO2 is end-tidal PCO2) to graded dead space before airway anesthesia was 10.2 +/- 4.6 (SD) l.min-1.Torr-1, which was significantly greater than the steady-state CO2 response (1.4 +/- 0.6 l.min-1.Torr-1, P less than 0.001). Dead-space loading produced greater oscillation in airway PCO2 than did CO2 gas loading. After airway anesthesia, ventilatory response to graded dead space decreased significantly, to 2.1 +/- 0.6 l.min-1.Torr-1 (P less than 0.01) but was still greater than that to CO2. The response to CO2 did not significantly differ (1.3 +/- 0.5 l.min-1.Torr-1). Tidal volume, mean inspiratory flow, respiratory frequency, inspiratory time, and expiratory time during dead-space breathing were also depressed after airway anesthesia, particularly during large dead-space loading. On the other hand, during CO2 inhalation, these respiratory variables did not significantly differ before and after airway anesthesia. These results suggest that in conscious humans vagal airway receptors play a role in the ventilatory response to graded dead space and control of the breathing pattern during dead-space loading by detecting the oscillation in airway PCO2. These receptors do not appear to contribute to the ventilatory response to inhaled CO2.\r"

The main findings are the following. 1) Aminophylline and theophylline hyperpolarize the fibers in a dose-dependent manner. This effect is present with 0.1 and 0.25 mM of aminophylline and theophylline, respectively, and the maximum effect is reached with 1 mM of the drug (approximately 5-8 mV in comparison to the normal values). This effect is reversible by washing out the preparation with normal solution. 2) Dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP, 2 mM) produces a similar increment in the Vm. 3) The hyperpolarizing action observed in the presence of aminophylline, theophylline, and DBcAMP is suppressed by 5 X 10(-4) M ouabain or by lowering the bath temperature to 5 degrees C. These results suggest that the xanthines may directly or indirectly stimulate a Na-K pump. Two possibilities may be considered: 1) an electrogenic effect of the Na-K pump and 2) a reduction in the extracellular K+ concentration in the solution contacting the external side of the cell as a consequence of the activity of the Na-K pump. Alternative mechanisms such as a reduction in Na permeability or an increment in K permeability might collaborate in the hyperpolarizing effect of the drugs tested.\r"

Regional blood flows were measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Diaphragmatic O2 consumption (VO2 di) (ml.min-1.100 g-1) was determined from the diaphragmatic blood flow (Qdi) and the arterial and phrenic venous O2 contents. With oleic acid-induced pulmonary edema, PTI Qdi, and VO2 di increased from control of 101.7 +/- 31.7, 17 +/- 1.8, and 0.81 +/- 0.11, respectively, to 187.2 +/- 27.6, 42.2 +/- 7.2, and 3.32 +/- 0.35 (P less than 0.05). With tamponade, PTI did not change (186.7 +/- 60.0), whereas VO2 di increased further to 3.98 +/- 0.98 (P less than 0.05) due to increased O2 extraction and no significant change in Qdi (32.8 +/- 4.0). As fatigue developed, VO2 di decreased to 2.30 +/- 0.23 due to the combined effects of small declines in Qdi and the arterial O2 content but remained higher than control even though the energy demands returned to control values. In conclusion, when cardiogenic shock is added to pulmonary edema VO2 di and energy output do not increase further and eventually fall.\r"

Nine healthy males wearing neoprene wet suits (5 mm thick) were subjected to immersion to the neck in water at 1, 2, and 2.5 ATA while resting for 3 h. Continuous measurements of esophageal (T(es)) and skin (Tsk) temperatures and heat loss from the skin (Htissue) and wet suits (Hsuit) were recorded. Insulation of the tissue (Itissue), wet suits (Isuit), and overall total (Itotal) were calculated from the temperature gradient and the heat loss. The Tcw increased curvilinearly as the pressure increased, whereas the metabolic heat production during rest and immersion was identical over the range of pressure tested. During the 3rd h of immersion, Tes was identical under all atmospheric pressures; however, Tsk was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) at 2 and 2.5 ATA compared with 1 ATA. A 42 (P less than 0.001) and 50% (P less than 0.001), reduction in Isuit from the 1 ATA value was detected at 2 and 2.5 ATA, respectively. However, overall mean Itissue was maximal and independent of the pressure during immersion at Tcw. The Itotal was also significantly smaller in 2 and 2.5 ATA compared with 1 ATA. The Itissue provided most insulation in the extremities, such as the hand and foot, and the contribution of Isuit in these body parts was relatively small. On the other hand, Itissue of the trunk areas, such as the chest, back, and thigh, was not high compared with the extremities, and Isuit played a major role in the protection of heat drain from these body parts.\r"

The purposes of this study were 1) to describe a mathematical model that would better define the inspiratory pressure-flow relationship of the upper airway during sleep and 2) to identify the segment of airway responsible for the sleep-related flow limitation. We measured nasal and total supralaryngeal pressure and flow during wakefulness and stage 2 sleep in five healthy male subjects lying supine. A right rectangular hyperbolic equation, V = (alpha P)/(beta + P), where V is flow, P is pressure, alpha is an asymptote for peak flow, and beta is pressure at a flow of alpha/2, was used in its linear form, P/V = (beta/alpha) + (P/alpha). The goodness of fit of the new equation was compared with that for the linearized Rohrer equation P/V = K1 + K2V. During wakefulness the fit of the hyperbolic equation to the actual pressure-flow data was equivalent to or significantly better than that for the Rohrer equation. During sleep the fit of the hyperbolic equation was superior to that for the Rohrer equation. For the whole supralaryngeal airway during sleep, the correlation coefficient for the hyperbolic equation was 0.90 +/- 0.50, and for the Rohrer equation it was 0.49 +/- 0.25. The flow-limiting segment was located within the pharyngeal airway, not in the nose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used leg ergometry (LE) as a reference. Exercise duration was shorter for UAE vs. LE (207 +/- 67 vs. 514 +/- 224 s, P less than 0.05) even though the end-exercise VO2 was lower for UAE (9.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 30.8 +/- 3.2 ml.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05). Eight subjects had positive Ppl-Pga slopes and less negative end-inspiratory Ppl during UAE vs. LE (-11.8 +/- 6 vs. -19 +/- 7 cmH2O, P less than 0.05). This was not due to the lower VT's achieved during UAE, since at a similar VT, UAE resulted in a rightward and downward displacement of the Ppl-Pga slopes. Three of the subjects had irregular breathing rhythm and negative Ppl-Pga slopes as early as 1 min after initiation of UAE. They had shorter UAE duration and more dyspnea than the eight with positive Ppl-Pga slopes. In most subjects UAE decreases the ventilatory contribution of some of the inspiratory muscles of the rib cage as they have to partake in nonventilatory functions. This results in a shift of the dynamic work to the diaphragm and abdominal muscles of exhalation. In a few subjects UAE results in an irregular breathing pattern and very short exercise tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two strains of rats, three strains of mice, and one strain each of hamster and guinea pig were used in this study. The numbers of recovered cells by bronchoalveolar lavage generally correlated with animal body weight. The one exception was the Syrian Golden hamster from which increased numbers of macrophages were recovered. Cellular differential data obtained from lavaged cytocentrifuge preparations demonstrated that PM's account for greater than 97% of recoverable free lung cells for all species except the guinea pig, which contains a resident population of eosinophils. Cell morphology studies indicated that hamster PM exhibited the highest proportion of ruffled PM and demonstrated the highest phagocytic activity, whereas mouse PM phagocytic activity was significantly reduced compared with the other three species. In addition, chemotaxis studies showed that rat PM migrated best to zymosan-activated, complement-dependent chemoattractants, whereas hamster PM demonstrated an enhanced chemotactic response to N-formyl peptides. The results of these studies suggest that the rat may be the most efficient species for clearing inhaled particles, whereas hamsters and guinea pigs may best respond to bacteria.\r"

Effective beta-adrenergic blockade was documented by a decrease in peak exercise heart rate of 54 +/- 11 (SE) beats/min (P less than 0.05) and a one-log magnitude of increase in the isoproterenol-heart rate dose-response curve. Testing was performed before drug treatment or training and again after training without the drug for 5 days.

Using an esophageal catheter electrode, we recorded phasic respiratory activity consistent with that of the principal laryngeal abductors, the posterior cricoarytenoids (PCA). Sequential activation of PCA and Di preceded inspiration. PCA activity typically peaked early in inspiration followed by either a decrescendo or tonic EMG activity of variable amplitude during expiration. Expiratory airflow retardation, or braking, accompanied by expiratory prolongation and reduced ventilation, was commonly observed. In some subjects we observed a time interval between PCA onset and a sudden increase in expiratory airflow just before inspiration, suggesting that release of the brake involved an abrupt loss of antagonistic adductor activity. Our findings suggest that airflow in newborn infants is controlled throughout the breathing cycle by the coordinated action of the Di and the reciprocal action of PCA and laryngeal adductor activities. We conclude that braking mechanisms in infants interact with vagal reflex mechanisms that modulate respiratory cycle timing to influence both the dynamic maintenance of end-expiratory lung volume and ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) on pulmonary hemodynamics and vascular permeability using isolated perfused guinea pig lungs and cultured monolayers of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. In lungs perfused with Ringer solution, containing 0.5 g/100 ml albumin (R-alb), LTB4 (4 micrograms) transiently increased pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and capillary pressure (Pcap). Pulmonary edema developed within 70 min after LTB4 injection despite a normal Pcap. The LTB4 metabolite, 20-COOH-LTB4 (4 micrograms), did not induce hemodynamic and lung weight changes. In lungs perfused with autologous blood hematocrit = 12 +/- 1%; protein concentration = 1.5 +/- 0.2 g/100 ml), the increases in Ppa and Pcap were greater, and both pressures remained elevated. The lung weight did not increase in blood-perfused lungs. In lungs perfused with R-alb (1.5 g/100 ml albumin) to match the blood perfusate protein concentration, LTB4 induced similar hemodynamic changes as R-alb (0.5 g/100 ml) perfusate, but the additional albumin prevented the pulmonary edema. LTB4 (10(-11)-10(-6) M) with or without the addition of neutrophils to the monolayer did not increase endothelial 125I-albumin permeability. Therefore LTB4 induces pulmonary edema when the perfusate contains a low albumin concentration, but increasing the albumin concentration or adding blood cells prevents the edema. The edema is not due to increased endothelial permeability to protein and is independent of hemodynamic alterations. Protection at higher protein-concentration may be the result of LTB4 binding to albumin.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of an increase in base-line tone on pulmonary vascular responses to acetylcholine were investigated in the pulmonary vascular bed of the intact-chest cat. Under conditions of controlled blood flow and constant left atrial pressure, intralobar injections of acetylcholine under low-tone base-line conditions increased lobar arterial pressure in a dose-related manner. When tone was increased moderately by alveolar hypoxia, acetylcholine elicited dose-dependent decreases in lobar arterial pressure, and at the highest dose studied, acetylcholine produced a biphasic response. When tone was raised to a high steady level with the prostaglandin analogue, U46619, acetylcholine elicited marked dose-related decreases in lobar arterial pressure. Atropine blocked both vasoconstrictor responses at low tone and vasodilator responses at high tone, whereas meclofenamate and BW 755C had no effect on responses to acetylcholine at low or high tone. The vasoconstrictor response at low tone was blocked by pirenzepine (20 and 50 micrograms/kg iv) but not gallamine (10 mg/kg iv). The vasodilator response at high tone was not blocked by pirenzepine (50 micrograms/kg iv) or gallamine or pancuronium (10 mg/kg iv). The present data support the concept that pulmonary vascular responses to acetylcholine are tone dependent and suggest that the vasoconstrictor response under low-tone conditions is mediated by a high-affinity muscarinic (M1)-type receptor. These data also suggest that vasodilator responses under high-tone conditions are mediated by muscarinic receptors that are neither M1 nor M2 low-affinity muscarinic-type receptor and that responses to acetylcholine are not dependent on the release of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase products.\r"

The mortalities in 85% O2 were 100, 33, and 0% for the food-restricted, restricted-refed, and freely fed groups, respectively. In air lung polyamine contents and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activities were significantly lower with food restriction. After hyperoxia, lung polyamine and protein contents and enzyme activities were increased in the two surviving groups, but spermine and DNA contents of refed rats did not increase. In a second experiment, we exposed rats to 60% O2 and found that DNA synthesis of food-restricted rats was lower than the freely fed rats in air and remained low after hyperoxia. We conclude that food restriction increases the mortality from 85% O2 and is associated with lower DNA synthesis and polyamine content. We speculate that food-restricted animals may accumulate greater lung injury partly because of a compromised repair process.\r"

Turnover experiments were performed on 117 black and 74 beige mice that were assayed for lamellar body-rich fraction (LB) and alveolar lavage fluid (AF) DSPC from 0.5 to 100 h after injection of [3H]glycerol. The data were analyzed by a program that derived the best-fit rate constants for an operator-chosen compartmental model. For black mice, a simple model with bidirectional exchange of DSPC between LB and AF compartments fitted the data almost as well as more complex models. This model yielded a turnover time of 5.9 h, a biological half-life of 16 h, and recycling of AF DSPC into LB of 47%. There was some evidence to suggest that DSPC might be degraded rather than recycled as a unit. For beige mice, the DSPC turnover time was 4.8 h, and its biological half-life was 40 h. The AF DSPC pool was smaller than in black mice, but the LB pool was larger. The bidirectional flux of DSPC between AF and LB was much greater than in black mice, the percent of recycling being 85. These data do not support a microtubular defect in beige mice, but the calculations for beige mice are based on a model of questionable validity.\r"

Since PAF has profound effects on both platelets and granulocytes, we investigated the effects of platelet and granulocyte depletion on the sheep's response to exogenous PAF. Sheep received PAF when granulocyte and platelets counts were normal and after platelet depletion with rabbit antisheep platelet antibodies (n = 5) or granulocyte depletion with hydroxyurea (n = 5). Sheep served as their own controls, and the order of experimentation was varied. Bolus injections of PAF had reproducible effects on pulmonary hemodynamics (pulmonary arterial pressure increased acutely to 85 +/- 3.7 cmH2O) and lung mechanics (dynamic compliance of the lungs decreased to 24.5 +/- 3.8% of base line and resistance to airflow across the lungs increased greater than 10-fold) and caused marked increases in lung lymph concentrations of thromboxane B2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha. The single bolus injection of PAF also caused marked prolonged elevations in lung lymph flow and increases in the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio for 3 h after PAF. PAF had profound effects despite platelet and granulocyte depletion. Platelet depletion slightly attenuated the pulmonary hypertension observed after PAF injection. Platelet depletion also attenuated the increases in thromboxane B2 concentrations in lung lymph, and lung mechanics normalized more rapidly in platelet-depleted sheep. There were no statistically significant effects of granulocyte depletion to less than 200 granulocytes/mm3 on any of the measured variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This investigation examined the effect of N2-He-O2 on decompression outcome in rats after variable time-at-depth dives. Unanesthetized male albino rats were subjected to one of two series of simulated dives: 1) N2-He-O2 dives (20.9% O2) at 175 feet of seawater fsw) and 2) N2-O2 dives (variable percentage of O2; depths from 141 to 207 fsw). Time at depth ranged from 10 to 120 min; rats were then decompressed within 10 s to surface pressure. The probability of decompression sickness (severe bends symptoms or death) was analyzed with a Hill equation model, with parameters for gas potency and equilibrium time for the three gases and weight of the animal. Relative potencies for the three gases were of similar magnitude for bends and statistically different for death in ascending order: O2 less than He less than N2. Estimated gas uptake rates were different. N2 took three to four times as long as He to reach full effect; the rate of O2 appeared to be considerably shorter than that of N2 or He. The large influence of O2 on decompression outcome questions the simplistic view that O2 cannot contribute to the decompression requirement.\r"

A family of such V0-muscle length (L) curves was obtained at 1-s intervals in the time course of contraction. The V0-L curve was fitted by a parabolic function with satisfactory goodness of fit.

We instrumented the fetus to record electrocortical activity (ECoG), eye movements (EOG), diaphragmatic activity (integral of EMGdi), heart rate, carotid blood pressure, and amniotic pressure. Saline and morphine in doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 3 mg/kg were injected in random order in the jugular vein of the fetus during low-voltage ECoG. Fetuses were videotaped for evaluation of fetal behavior. We found 1) that saline did not elicit a response; 2) apnea, associated with a change from low- to high-voltage ECoG, increased from 2.2 +/- 1.5 (SE) min in two fetuses at a dose of 0.03 mg to 20 +/- 6.3 min in seven fetuses at 3 mg/kg (P less than 0.005); 3) the length of the breathing responses, associated with a change from high- to low-voltage ECoG, were 15 +/- 1.8 and 135.9 +/- 18.1 min (P less than 0.0005); 4) integral of EMGdi X frequency, an index equivalent to minute ventilation, increased from 1,763 +/- 317 arbitrary units to 10,658 +/- 1,843 at 1.0 mg/kg and then decreased to 7,997 +/- 1,335 at 3.0 mg/kg. These changes were related to a steady increase in integral of EMGdi, whereas frequency decreased at 3 mg/kg. There was an increase in breathing response to morphine plasma concentrations or morphine doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, during constant-flow ventilation (CFV) the mean alveolar pressure is increased, causing increased lung volume despite low pressures in the trachea. We hypothesized that the increased dynamic alveolar pressures during CFV were due to momentum transfer from the high-velocity jet stream to resident gas in the lung. To test this, we simulated CFV in straight tubes and in a branched airway model to determine whether changes in gas flow rate (V), gas density (rho), and tube diameter (D) altered the pressure difference (delta P) between alveoli and airway opening in a manner consistent with that predicted by conservation of momentum. Momentum analysis predicts that delta P should vary with V2, whereas measurements yielded a dependence of V1.69 in branched tubes and V1.9 in straight tubes. Substitution of heliox (80% He-20% O2) for air significantly reduced lung hyperinflation during CFV. As predicted by momentum transfer, delta P varied with rho 1.0. Momentum analysis also predicts that delta P should vary with D-2.0, whereas measurements indicated a dependence on D-2.02. The influence of V and rho on depth of penetration of the jet down the airway was explored in a straight tube model by varying the flow rate and gas used. The influence of geometry on penetration was measured by changing the ratio of jet-to-airway tube diameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In states of reduced supply, VO2 declines sharply below a critical level of O2 delivery (QO2 = blood flow X arterial O2 content). Although several investigators have measured a critical O2 delivery in whole animals or in isolated tissues, there is no general agreement over how to determine the critical point from a collection of real data. In this study, we compare three algorithms for finding the critical O2 delivery from a set of experimental data. We also present a technique for estimating the effect of experimental error on the precision of these algorithms. Using 16 data sets collected in normal dogs, we compare single-line, dual-line, and polynomial regression algorithms for identifying the critical O2 delivery. The dual-line and polynomial regression techniques fit the data better (mean residual square deviation 0.024 and 0.031, respectively) than the single-regression line approach (0.110). To investigate the influence of experimental error on the derived critical QO2, we used a Monte Carlo technique, repeatedly perturbing the experimental data to simulate experimental error. We then calculated the variance of the critical QO2 frequency distribution obtained when the three algorithms were applied to the perturbed data. By this analysis, the dual-line regression technique was less sensitive to experimental error than the polynomial technique.\r"

  ".W": "Determinations of pulmonary diffusing capacity for CO (DLCO) by physiological and morphometric techniques have resulted in substantially different values for both DLCO and its major components. To evaluate the differences in these methods of measurement of DLCO, measurements were made under controlled conditions on isolated perfused dog lungs. Multiple gas-rebreathing techniques were used to measure DLCO, the membrane component of the diffusing capacity for CO (DmCO), and pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc) in both anesthetized dogs and after isolation and perfusion of their lungs. The isolated perfused lungs were than perfusion fixed for morphometric analysis of the components of DLCO. The values obtained morphometrically for Vc were similar to those measured by physiological techniques. Perfusion fixation did not substantially alter the morphometric estimate of DmCO when compared with previous values obtained on inflation fixed lungs. However, the morphometric estimate of DmCO was over 10 times higher than that estimated physiologically. Analysis of the potential errors in the techniques suggests that the correct value for DmCO is substantially higher than that commonly estimated by use of physiological techniques and that the explanation for the difference is due to a number of factors that can influence the binding of CO to hemoglobin under in vivo conditions. The net effect of these factors can be represented by an unknown in each component of the Roughton-Forster relationship so that 1/DL = 1/(U1.Dm) + 1/(U2.theta Vc), where theta is the binding rate for CO to hemoglobin. Because the magnitudes of the unknown terms (U1 and U2) in the Roughton-Forster relationship are likely to be large, this relationship cannot be reliably used to determine Dm and Vc.\r"

To characterize the antioxidant properties of ELF, young, healthy, nonsmoking volunteers underwent bronchoalveolar lavage with determination of ELF volumes and ELF proteins. ELF (greater than 0.4 ml) is a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation as measured by malondialdehyde (MDA) production in an in vitro iron-dependent assay system. Two serum proteins, transferrin and ceruloplasmin, were quantitated in ELF and found to be potent inhibitors of lipid peroxidation. Other ELF components, including vitamin E, vitamin C, and albumin, did not function as antioxidants in this system. Several experimental observations suggest that ELF transferrin was more important than ceruloplasmin in inhibiting lipid peroxidation: 1) ELF concentrations of transferrin were 20-fold higher than those for ceruloplasmin; 2) ELF antioxidant activity was abolished by preincubation with Fe3+; 3) ELF antioxidant activity was minimally affected by sodium azide, which is known to inhibit ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity; and 4) ELF ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity was virtually nondetectable. ELF possesses a significant antioxidant activity that may be important in vivo in protecting the lung from oxidant injury.\r"

Regional ventilation per unit of lung volume (spVr) was assessed with a positron camera during the washout of the tracer isotope 13NN from the lungs of 12 supine dogs. From the washout data, functional images of the mean residence time (MRT) of 13NN were produced and spVr was estimated as the inverse of the regional MRT. We found that at a constant VT X f product (where f represents frequency), increasing VT resulted in higher overall lung spV through the local enhancement of the basal spVr and with little effect in the apical spVr. In contrast, increasing VT X f at constant VT increased overall ventilation without significantly affecting the distribution of spVr values. TE/TI had no substantial effect in regional spVr distribution. These findings suggest that the dependency of gas transport during HFV of the form VT2 X f is the result of a progressive regional transition in gas transport mechanism. It appears, therefore, that as VT increases, the gas transport mechanism changes from a relative inefficient dispersive mechanism, dependent on VT X f, to the more efficient mechanism of direct fresh gas convection to alveoli with high regional tidal volume-to-dead-space ratio. A mathematical model of gas transport in a nonhomogeneous lung that exhibits such behavior is presented.\r"

Immature rats, at 2 to 11 days of age, exhibited significant L:D differences in M and Tco. However, no significant L:D differences in these responses were noted at 15 days of age. In every case, nocturnal increases in Tco were associated with a rise in M. L:D differences in Tco response were not attributed to a significant change in total thermal conductance. These data support the conclusion that the immature rat exhibits daily variation in metabolic rate, which is the primary contributor to L:D shifts in Tco.\r"

Exercise more than doubled cardiac output and increased pulmonary arterial pressures from 19.2 +/- 1 to 34.8 +/- 3.5 (SE) cmH2O. Lung lymph flow increased rapidly fivefold during progressive exercise and returned immediately to base-line levels when exercise was stopped. Lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratios decreased slightly but steadily. Lymph flows correlated closely with changes in cardiac output and with calculated microvascular pressures. The drop in lymph-to-plasma protein ratio during exercise suggests that microvascular pressure rises during exercise, perhaps due to increased pulmonary venous pressure. Lymph flow and protein content were unaffected by hypoxia, and hypoxia did not alter the lymph changes seen during normoxic exercise. Lung lymph flow did not immediately return to base line after prolonged exercise, suggesting hydration of the lung interstitium.\r"

A combination of the tetrakaidecahedron (14-hedron) and the order-2 14-hedron formed by 14 14-hedra surrounding a central one that is perforated for ventilation meets the requirements. Alveolar ductal tree is formed by these order-2 polyhedra. Equilibrium and elasticity require the alveolar mouths to be curved and convex toward the alveolar wall. Perforation of additional walls causes a variety of alveolar shapes. The predicted shapes of the alveoli, the shapes of alveolar mouths, the lengths of sacs and ducts, the statistics of the dihedral angles, stars, corners, lines, dots, and vertices compare well with available morphometric data. The vascular and bronchial trees are joined at the alveolar level: each arteriole supplies 0.75 and each venule drains 0.72 order-2 polyhedra.\r"

The same segments were reexamined on later occasions (2-11 wk apart) to determine whether the responsiveness to histamine had altered with time. Measurements of base-line Rcoll for a given segment were reproducible (coefficient of variation 0.48). In contrast, we observed that the estimated dose of histamine required to increase Rcoll by 50% (ED150Rcoll) was extremely variable both among lung segments of an individual dog on a single experimental day (geometric mean variability of 40-fold) and for a given segment when reexamined on repeated occasions (geometric mean variability of 47-fold). The ED150Rcoll did not correlate with the base-line Rcoll. The degree of variability we observed suggests that peripheral contractile elements are under the influence of powerful local modulating factors that vary both regionally and temporally.\r"

Interactions between turbulent eddies and cardiogenic oscillations are included using a modification of Taylor dispersion theory according to the formulation of Kamm et al. Predicted values for arterial PCO2 are reasonably similar to experimental results for He-O2, air, and SF6-O2 mixtures for catheter flow rates from 0.2 to 1.6 l/s. Specific impedance to gas exchange was found to be largest immediately proximal to the end of turbulent mixing zone, where transport is governed by low-level eddy mixing and molecular diffusion. Simulations suggest that, during CFV, cardiogenic oscillations augment gas exchange primarily by promoting turbulent eddy dispersion in the distal airways and by extending the length of the turbulent mixing zone. Even small displacements of the catheter are shown to have a dramatic effect on gas exchange.\r"

From these data, the global and regionally distributed exchanges of water and heat that occurred throughout the respiratory tract were calculated. During each provocation, intra-airway temperatures fell equivalently, thereby producing similar intrathoracic water fluxes and heat transfers. Neither stimulus was associated with airway drying, and both resulted in similar distributed losses of thermal energy from the tracheobronchial tree despite small regional heat and water exchanges. The degree of airway obstruction was identical after both challenges; however, the onset of airway narrowing was earlier with hyperventilation and developed in association with more rapid rewarming. These data demonstrate that the hyperpnea of exercise and hyperventilation produce identical thermal consequences within the respiratory tract of asthmatics.\r"

This is compatible with the concept that its major mechanism of injury is the stimulation of O2 radicals by neutrophils, which in turn increase permeability by damaging the endothelial cells. In this study we measured vascular permeability and resistance before and 1 h after PMA in five groups of blood-perfused dog lungs: PMA alone in one group and pretreatment with catalase, superoxide dismutase, deferoxamine, and adenosine each in four other groups. By the use of two indexes of permeability, the filtration coefficient and the isogravimetric capillary pressure, we found that, compared with PMA alone, catalase, deferoxamine, and adenosine provided significant protection, whereas the results with superoxide dismutase were variable. These four drugs also significantly attenuated the marked increased resistance seen with PMA alone. Although the effects seen with the first three can be explained by their scavenging of O2 radicals, adenosine appears to provide protection through a separate mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Movement of chloride from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to brain or blood is one of the factors that may be involved in regulation of CSF [Cl-], which is important to CSF acid-base balance. We made quantitative measurements of the unidirectional outflux of radiolabeled chloride (38Cl, half-life 37.3 min) from CSF in anesthetized dogs, using ventriculocisternal perfusion (VCP). The outflux of 38Cl from CSF was determined from the difference between the movements of 38Cl and dextran using a one-compartment model. VCP was performed at a rate of 1.4 ml/min for 14 min, and then slowed to 0.28 ml/min. The 38Cl activity decreased to a steady-state level approximately 12% lower than that of dextran within 40-50 min. Under control conditions for the first run (n = 24), the flux was 0.042 +/- 0.003 (SE) ml/min. The outflux under control conditions (n = 6) tended to increase over three separate determinations in a 6-h period, being 136 +/- 19% of the first run on the second run, and 143 +/- 24% on the third. There were no significant changes in 38Cl outflux compared with control ratios after the inclusion of bumetanide in the VCP fluid (n = 6), which inhibits sodium-coupled Cl- transport, with acetazolamide (n = 6), which inhibits carbonic anhydrase, or with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (n = 6), an inhibitor of carrier-mediated anion exchange. These results suggest that the outward movement of chloride from CSF occurs mostly by passive diffusion and is not by mediated transport.\r"

During LBNP alone, which should have reduced cardiopulmonary baroreflex sympathoinhibition, AP and HR did not change from control, but MSNA increased 93 +/- 24% (P less than 0.05). Handgrip elicited contraction intensity-dependent increases in AP and HR (P less than 0.05), but MSNA increased above control only at the 30% MVC level (165 +/- 30%, P less than 0.05). The HR, AP, and MSNA responses to either level of handgrip performed during LBNP were not different from the algebraic sums of the corresponding responses to handgrip and LBNP performed separately (P greater than 0.05). Since there was no facilitation of the MSNA response to handgrip when performed during LBNP compared with algebraic sums of the separate responses, our results do not support the hypothesis that cardiopulmonary baroreflexes modulate (inhibit) sympathetic outflow during exercise in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The application of the flow interrupter technique to series and parallel models of the respiratory system is examined theoretically, assuming instantaneous transmission of pressures and incompressible gases in the lung air spaces. The initial pressure change observed immediately after occlusion divided by the preocclusion flow gives an initial resistance (Rinit) equal to that of the airway tree when the model consists of compartments connected in parallel. When the compartments are connected in series, Rinit is the resistance of the most proximal airway only. In general, the initial pressure change is followed by a second slower change, reflecting equilibration of pressures between the compartments. The total postocclusion pressure change divided by the flow gives a steady-state resistance (Rss) whose value depends on the ventilation history before occlusion. When this history consists of a relaxed expiration Rss asymptotes from Rinit to a value higher than the zero-frequency resistance of the model as the expiratory time increases. However, the relative contributions of serial and parallel pendelluft and viscoelasticity to Rss cannot be determined from pressure and flow measurements made at the airway opening. Therefore in disease, the interrupter method does not permit one to say whether ventilation inhomogeneity or alteration in lung tissue properties is the predominant abnormality.\r"

Mean PEmax FRC obtained with hands on was significantly higher than no-hands and tube methods. PEmax FRC values obtained by the other-hands and new-tube maneuvers were similar to the hands-on maneuver. We conclude that the technique used to measure PEmax FRC can significantly affect the results and suggest that it should be measured using a large-bore circular mouthpiece or a scuba-diving mouthpiece with the cheeks supported.\r"

However, the accuracy of this device has not been established in such low saturation ranges in humans. This study examines the tracking characteristics of the Opticath (Oximetrix, Mountain View, CA) pulmonary arterial catheter in comparison to simultaneously drawn blood specimens in which oxyhemoglobin saturation was determined by direct spectrophotometric oximetry. The results show that the catheter follows saturation established by bench oximetry quite closely between 50 and 80%, the range most commonly encountered in the clinical setting. However, at saturations below this range, the catheter consistently underestimates direct spectrophotometry. Since accuracy is extremely important for research purposes, two equations that can be used to correct catheter readings for mixed venous saturations less than 50% are presented.\r"

The arterial-alveolar N2 difference was determined using a manometric technique for the measurement of the arterial N2 partial pressure (PN2). We adopted a two-compartment model of the lung, one compartment having a VA/Q of approximately 1, the other being open, gas filled, unventilated (VA/Q = 0), and in equilibrium with the mixed venous blood. This theoretical single compartment represents all lung regions responsible for the arterial-alveolar N2 difference. The fractional blood flow to this compartment was calculated using an appropriate mixing equation (Q0/QT). There was a weak but significant relationship between Q0/QT and the perfusion fraction to lung regions with low VA/Q (0.005 less than VA/Q less than 0.1) (r = 0.542, P less than 0.05) and a close relationship between Q0/QT and the perfusion fraction to lung regions with VA/Q ratios less than 0.9 (r = 0.862, P less than 0.001) as obtained from MIGET. The difference Qva/QT-Q0/QT yielded a close estimation of the MIGET right-to-left shunt (Qs/QT) (r = 0.962, P less than 0.001). We conclude that the assessment of the arterial-alveolar N2 difference and Q0/QT does not yield a quantitative estimation of the contribution of pathologically low VA/Q areas to QVa/QT because these parameters reflect an unknown combination of pathological and normal (0.1 less than VA/Q less than 0.9) gas exchange units.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Flows were examined during control 1 (diaphragm at rest), pacing (phrenic pacing: rate 20/min, duty cycle 0.33), control 2, hypotension (rest with mean arterial pressure reduced by 45% of the control 1 value), and hypotension and pacing. As a percent of the control 1 value, Qpa was 511 +/- 107% during pacing, 139 +/- 12% during control 2, 40 +/- 13% during hypotension, and finally 347 +/- 31% during hypotension and pacing. Similarly, percent left hemidiaphragmatic blood flow (Qlh) was 362 +/- 91% during pacing, 91 +/- 10% during control 2, 14 +/- 2% during hypotension, and finally 213 +/- 50% during hypotension and pacing. The changes in flow to the left costal and crural diaphragm were similar to those recorded for Qlh. We conclude that Qpa correlates with total and regional diaphragmatic blood flow (r = 0.77-0.81, P less than 0.001) under conditions of supramaximal phrenic nerve stimulation in which the metabolic demands of the region perfused by the phrenic artery are presumed to be similar to the metabolic demands of the rest of the diaphragm.\r"

Eight anesthetized dogs were embolized via carotid approach [6 left anterior descending (LAD), 1 left circumflex (LCX), and 1 LAD and LCX]. Plug positions were monitored fluoroscopically.

  ".W": "Substances released from immunoglobin (Ig) E-stimulated mast cells are likely to be among the chemical mediators responsible for changes in the vagal component of airway reactivity. We have attempted to identify a direct role for mast cell mediators in the control of visceral afferent excitability by examining intracellular electrophysiological changes in vagal neurons after application of extracts prepared from purified and IgE-stimulated human lung mast cells (HLMC). HLMC's, applied by superfusion or by focal pressure ejection from micropipettes, reversibly enhanced the excitability of a subpopulation of rabbit visceral sensory C-fiber neurons by 1) abolishing the slow Ca2+-dependent post-spike after hyperpolarization that uniquely resides in these neurons and controls their spike frequency, 2) depolarizing the cell membrane potential, and 3) increasing membrane input resistance. Control HLMC prepared by subjecting purified human lung mast cells to normal goat serum had no measurable affects on neuronal excitability. The immunologically released constituents responsible for these excitability changes are likely to be lipid mediators, because essentially all biological activity is extractable into an organic phase after methanol-chloroform solvent extraction of the HLMC preparations. These results provide the first unambiguous evidence that products released from immunologically challenged HLMC's directly affect visceral afferent nerve cell function.\r"

The highest percentages of excellent results were achieved by percutaneous Kirschner-wire fixation (78 per cent), skeletal traction (67 per cent), and open reduction with internal fixation (67 per cent). Closed reduction and application of a cast was associated with a significantly lower percentage of early and late complications, including Volkmann ischemic contracture and cubitus varus. It is recommended that treatment with a cast be reserved for undisplaced fractures only. Percutaneous Kirschner-wire fixation is advocated as the method of choice for the majority of displaced fractures.\r"

Of the thirty-nine pathological specimens that were obtained intraoperatively, twenty-six (67 per cent) contained elements either of primary interdigital neuroma tissue or of an interdigital neuroma in association with an amputation-stump neuroma, indicating that the recurrent pain in these patients had probably resulted from an incomplete initial excision. All but one of the thirty-four patients were available for follow-up at an average of seventy-six months (range, ten to 124 months) postoperatively. Twenty-two patients (67 per cent) had complete relief from or marked improvement in pain, three (9 per cent) had improvement but had persistent pain, and eight (24 per cent) had no improvement or had worse pain. The longitudinal plantar incision was satisfactory in all but one patient and did not result in a painful plantar scar. The number of previously unsuccessful attempts that had been made to excise the neuroma did not adversely affect the results of reoperation in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Of thirty-four selected patients who had rheumatoid arthritis and subluxations of the atlanto-axial and other joints of the cervical spine, eighteen were treated operatively and sixteen were treated non-operatively. Of the subluxations of the atlanto-axial joint, nineteen were anterior; four, posterior; and eleven, vertical. Additionally, subaxial subluxations were seen in three patients. At the time of treatment, the mean duration of the rheumatoid disease was 19.4 years and the mean duration of the disorders of the cervical spine was 4.5 years. After treatment the patients were followed for an average of 2.2 years (range, six months to six years). Of the thirty-four patients, two (both of whom were treated non-operatively) died of causes unrelated to the lesions of the cervical spine and were excluded from this study. Of the remaining thirty-two patients, eighteen were treated operatively and fourteen, non-operatively. The two groups were roughly comparable with respect to the lesions of the cervical spine, but more of the patients who were treated surgically showed evidence of compression of the cord as demonstrated by computed tomography and myelography. The thirty-two patients were not randomized in the two groups; therefore, comparison of the findings in these groups is not completely valid. Surgical treatment of the eighteen patients included an atlanto-axial fusion in thirteen and an occipitocervical fusion in five. In addition, two patients who had an occipitocervical fusion also had a subaxial laminectomy and posterior fusion. There was a superficial wound infection, which was treated successfully with short-term antibiotic therapy, in two patients. No patient died postoperatively. Occipital pain was relieved in twelve of the fifteen operatively treated patients who had pain, whereas pain was relieved in only one of the eight conservatively treated patients who had pain. At follow-up, neurological function was unchanged or improved in the operatively treated group but was slightly worse in the conservatively treated group. We concluded that fusion of an unstable rheumatoid cervical spine relieves pain and prevents progression of existing neural lessons without undue risk for the patient.\r"

There was no apparent correlation between failure of the component and the age or sex of the patient, the diagnosis, the use of cement, the femorotibial alignment, or the use of lateral release. The patients in whom the patellar implant failed were relatively heavy, and the diagnosis in most of them was osteoarthritis. The failure was due to one of two mechanisms: wear or fracture, or both, of the polyethylene over the edge of the metal backing (eighteen components), or dissociation of the polyethylene or the base-plate, or both, from the anchoring pegs (seven components). In many of the patients, failure of the component was not suspected before arthrotomy. The failure led to considerable wear of the femoral component in eleven patients and to metal-induced synovitis in twenty-three. We concluded that metal backing may predispose the patellar component to a small but important likelihood of failure, and we urge caution in choosing a metal-backed patellar implant. Additional research is necessary to improve designs for the patellar component, especially if metal backing is to be used.\r"

Each spine was destabilized with bilateral laminectomy and facetectomy of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, resection of the pars interarticularis of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and resection of the disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. Sequential stabilization of each spine was used to compare the stiffness of: (1) Harrington distraction instrumentation of five levels, (2) Luque rectangular instrumentation of five levels, (3) modified Steffee transpedicular notched-rod instrumentation of three and five levels, and (4) Cotrel-Dubousset transpedicular instrumentation of three and five levels with and without transverse approximating rods. This in vitro study of a calf-spine model led to three reproducible conclusions: (1) after laminectomy and discectomy, the instrumented spine was more unstable in rotation and flexion than when it was subjected to axial compressive loads; (2) the most rigid implant was the Cotrel-Dubousset transpedicular instrumentation of five vertebral levels (p less than 0.05); and (3) with the Steffee or the Cotrel-Dubousset transpedicular instrumentation of three vertebral levels, it was possible to restore torsional, compressive, and flexural rigidity to the destabilized spine of the calf. Furthermore, transpedicular fixation of only three vertebral levels provided more in vitro stability than either traditional Harrington or Luque rectangular instrumentation, which require fixation of five vertebral levels to stabilize a spine after laminectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Between April and October 1981, nineteen children who were between five and twelve years old (median age, seven years), and who had severe paralytic scoliosis secondary to poliomyelitis, were treated by segmental spinal instrumentation without arthrodesis. Three patients could not be followed, and the cases of the remaining sixteen patients were reviewed in April 1984. In fifteen patients, the implant system had failed to control the deformity. In six patients, the rods had fractured at the apex of the original deformity; in five, longitudinal shift of the rods had allowed recurrence of the deformity; and in four, the short limb of one or both of the L-shaped rods had rotated out of the pelvis and perforated the skin, resulting in an infection that necessitated removal of the rods. At the time of the review, the deformity was essentially the same as before the original instrumentation in all but the sixteenth patient, in whom failure had not occurred. The instrumented vertebrae had grown measurably in some of the patients, but spontaneous fusion--particularly in the thoracic spine--was observed when the rods were removed. This finding indicates that, using presently available materials, segmental instrumentation of the spine without arthrodesis does not effectively control paralytic scoliosis secondary to poliomyelitis in a growing child.\r"

To determine whether the risk is similar for patients who have other metabolic disorders, we compared eight-nine patients who had various disturbances affecting bone and sixty-three postmenopausal women who had no evidence of underlying disease. Trabecular bone density was measured by quantitative computed tomography of the lumbar spine. The relationship between frequency of fracture and bone density was modeled mathematically with spline threshold, quadratic polynomial, and decaying exponential functions. Analysis of covariance showed that the diagnostic category did not influence the relationship between frequency of fracture and bone density in any of the three models. We concluded that the risk of atraumatic compression fracture, as assessed by measurement of vertebral trabecular bone density using quantitative computerized tomography, is independent of the underlying metabolic disturbance.\r"

Progressive increments of bone were removed from the posterior part of the acetabular wall in sixteen hips. After each osteotomy, the hip was tested for stability and was measured by computed tomography until it became unstable. All hips from which less than 20 per cent of the posterior part of the acetabular wall was removed were stable, while those from which more than 40 per cent was removed were unstable.\r"

The result was the same regardless of whether the patient had had a concomitant extra-articular (Ellison) procedure. The results of arthroscopic biopsy in eleven patients did not support the hypothesis that the meniscus underwent metaplasia to ligamentous tissue. Although this procedure yielded results similar to those of other procedures in which autogenous tissues are used to reconstruct the ligament, the meniscus should rarely, if ever, be used for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. The procedure is indicated only for patients who, in addition to needing reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, also have a torn meniscus that would otherwise have to be totally excised.\r"

At the follow-up examination, radiolucent lines were seen in 17 per cent of the knees. The complications included loosening of one or both prosthetic components in three knees (of which two were revised again); a hematoma in one knee; and a piece of loose cement, which had to be removed, in one knee. There were no deep infections. On the basis of these results, we concluded that revision total knee arthroplasty using a condylar prosthesis will have infrequent complications and will provide a satisfactory result in properly selected patients.\r"

Thirty-four of the patients had peripheral vascular insufficiency and were judged to lack the potential for using a prosthesis functionally, although the evaluation indicated that they had the potential for healing of the wound at the below-the-knee level of amputation. At a minimum follow-up of one year, the amputation wound had healed in thirty of these patients, and no joint contracture had developed. Two patients died in the first postoperative month, and two had failure to heal and needed revision to an above-the-knee amputation. The remaining twelve patients who had a through-the-knee amputation were judged to be potentially able to use a prosthesis functionally, but they did not have the capacity for wound-healing at the below-the-knee level. Therefore, in these patients, a through-the-knee amputation was performed as an alternative to an above-the-knee amputation. The amputation wound healed in eight of these patients, but four (33 per cent) had failure to heal and needed subsequent revision to an above-the-knee amputation. All twelve patients were able to use a prosthesis. The through-the-knee amputation provides good muscular balance and has a low risk for the late development of joint contracture. The residual limb (stump) provides an excellent surface area for sitting balance and a lever-arm for transfer. In a patient who has the potential to use a prosthesis functionally, the residual limb allows direct load-transfer (end weight-bearing).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis and staging of soft-tissue tumors is a complex problem, and even the experienced pathologist sometimes finds it difficult to determine whether a particular lesion is benign or malignant and whether a sarcoma is high or low grade. However, this information is essential in planning treatment. Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA is a method to determine the number of cells that are in the process of replicating or dividing (S or G2, or M phase), since these cells have abnormal concentrations of DNA (DNA aneuploidy). Previous studies from our laboratory have established the relative value of this technique as an adjunct in the staging of primary bone tumors. In the past four years, 146 soft-tissue lesions have been evaluated by flow cytometry, using propidium iodide staining of isolated cells that were obtained in the fresh state. The tumors were forty-two benign neoplasms, ten lesions of synovial origin, thirty desmoids (aggressive but not malignant), and sixty-four sarcomas ranging in grade from 1 to 3 on a 3-point scale. The over-all values for flow cytometry showed that a number of factors correlated well with the grade of the tumor, but the best correlations were with the mean concentration of DNA (a calculated average for concentrations of DNA for the various types of cells in the lesion), the total percentage of cells in S-phase plus the G2 and M-phases (called percentage of replicating and dividing cells), and the presence or absence of DNA aneuploidy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between May 1975 and December 1979, 113 patients had 153 arthroplasties using a total condylar knee prosthesis. Thirty patients (forty-two knees) died, and one (two knees) was lost to follow-up. Thirty-eight of these forty-four knees had been followed for more than two years, and none had had a revision. The remaining eighty-two patients (109 knees) were followed for an average of nine years (range, seven to 11.5 years). At the time of the latest examination, ten had had a revision for various reasons. For the ninety-nine knees that had the original prosthesis, the findings were compared with those of an evaluation that had been done four years postoperatively. The average over-all knee score was found to have decreased between the four-year and the latest follow-up evaluation, primarily because of a 7-point decrease in the score for function. The rate of infection was 0.6 per cent. The knees that had had patellar resurfacing had better over-all scores and better scores for pain than those that had not. This was particularly true in the patients who had osteoarthritis. The results of arthroplasty using a total condylar prosthesis appeared to be consistent and durable. Although there was a decrease in the quality of the functional result with increasing age, the patients reported consistent relief of pain.\r"

In six of those patients the disease was in remission at the time of writing, and the patients were asymptomatic. In the second group, two patients had episodic disability that correlated with the activity of the disease. In the third group, fourteen patients had progressive disability and radiographic changes. Fifty-five of the fifty-nine procedures that were performed on the hip and knee in this series were done on those fourteen patients. In the fourth group, six patients had dramatic clinical and radiographic findings but, at the time of the latest follow-up, had little functional disability. In all six of these patients, the disease was in remission. In the children in this study, protrusio acetabuli was more cephalad than has been found in adults who have rheumatoid arthritis. All of the children had psychosocial problems, but they responded well to counseling. These problems influenced the timing of the surgical treatment.\r"

The hip joint was spanned by a posterior pelvic-femoral skeletal external fixator. Nine patients, all of whom had thoracic-level paraplegia, were treated in this manner. The fixator was kept in place for three to six weeks while the patients were cared for in the prone position. All of the infections were fully healed by twelve weeks postoperatively. In two patients, the wound drained at the edge of the flap for a short time.\r"

Although other authors have discussed the length of survival of one or a few such patients, none, to our knowledge, has reported on postoperative movement of the shoulder. We correlated the type of resection of bone and muscle with the restrictions of postoperative movement. Our patients had an excellent range of postoperative movement, even after subradical resection. The study enabled us to make recommendations for reconstruction of muscle after resection and to determine the functional prognosis.\r"

In four limbs, more than 5 degrees of correction had been lost. No patient lost more than 10 degrees of correction. The rates of complications and of recurrence were similar to those of other reported series. We concluded that the spike osteotomy is safe and effective.\r"

The results were not affected by the grade of chondromalacia that was present at the time of operation; however, the differences in the results as correlated with the age and sex of the patient were statistically significant, the older patients having poorer results and the male patients, better results. Roentgenographic analysis of the postoperative position of the patella, as seen on the view described by Merchant et al., revealed that centralizing the patella in the intercondylar sulcus yielded the most favorable results.\r"

The five-year rate of survival was about 40 per cent for the male patients and about 80 per cent for the female patients. If the primary tumor was more than three centimeters in diameter or was deeply situated, the patients had a reduced life-span, as did the patients in whom the tumor was focally necrotic. More male than female patients had necrosis of the tumor, as seen on the pathological specimens. No significant difference in life-span was noted among the patients in whom the resection had a marginal, wide, or radical surgical margin. The data indicate that wide or radical resection should be done as soon as epithelioid sarcoma is diagnosed.\r"

Deep-vein thrombosis was diagnosed by roentgenographic venography, and pulmonary embolism, by perfusion lung-scanning. There was an unusually low incidence (10 per cent) of deep-vein thrombosis in this series. In contrast to other reports, we did not identify a relationship between deep-vein thrombosis and so-called risk factors such as advanced age, number of venous valves (more than five) in the lower extremity, abnormal coagulation-assay data, certain diseases, or preoperative limitation of mobility. In addition, hypertension, blood group, surgical approach, and choice of cemented or cementless total hip replacement did not seem to affect the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis. There was a low incidence of deep-vein thrombosis in patients in whom obesity, prolonged immobilization postoperatively, varicose veins, and hyperlipemia were not factors.\r"

The initial pathological finding was swelling of the superficial matrix associated with breakdown of the collagen fiber network, especially at matrix streaks in the superficial and transitional zones. Fibrillated cartilage contained surface fissures that penetrated the middle layers. Amorphous electron-dense material was found covering the internal surfaces of the fissures; this appeared to contain degraded components of the matrix. In association with these changes, there were formation of nests of cells (clusters of chondrocytes) and increased numbers of organelles in the chondrocytes. A limited repair reaction also was observed in some specimens; this was characterized by the migration of fibroblast-like cells over the surface of the cartilage. The ultrastructural observations on these specimens from patients who had chondromalacia were compatible with a pathogenesis resulting from mechanical overload.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1979 and 1986, sixteen of 369 open fractures of the tibial shaft were treated by external fixation followed by intramedullary nailing. These fractures comprised one Type-I, two Type-II, and thirteen Type-III injuries. This method of treatment was the original treatment plan in nine patients (56 per cent), for delayed union while the external fixator was still in place in four patients (25 per cent), for loss of reduction in a plaster cast in two patients (13 per cent), and for osteomyelitis and a segmental defect in one patient (6 per cent). The average duration of external fixation was 8.5 weeks; the average time between removal of the external fixator and intramedullary nailing, three weeks; and the average time between injury and nailing, twelve weeks. All sixteen patients were followed until either the fracture had united (eleven patients) or there was an established non-union (five patients). At that time, seventeen additional procedures were performed, including bone-grafting, fibulectomy, and re-nailing. Only five of the sixteen fractures healed without additional surgical procedures or major complications. The five fractures that progressed to a non-union were all Type III, and all were complicated by a deep infection. Over-all, the complications included seven deep infections (an intramedullary infection in four patients, osteomyelitis in two, and a chronic draining sinus associated with a ring sequestrum in one); five minor infections during external fixation, which developed into five of the seven deep infections that occurred after the secondary intramedullary nailing; and eight non-unions, three of which progressed to union after multiple procedures. The over-all incidence of non-union was 50 per cent and that of deep infection, 44 per cent. On the basis of the high incidence of complications in both the present series and the few reports in the literature, we concluded that alternative treatment options should be carefully considered before electing this sequential method of fixation.\r"

The action potentials were generated by stimulating the spinal cord with electrodes in the epidural space at the level of the fifth or sixth thoracic vertebra. This also was done in humans, using the same methods of stimulating and recording, but the intensity of the stimulus was adjusted to produce little or no twitch of the paraspinal muscles. In the animal experiment, the motor action potential was abolished after transection of the pyramidal tract and was progressively attenuated with effective doses of a curare-like agent. We also tested the effect of distraction, using the same technique as is used in Harrington instrumentation, and found that the amount of distraction that caused reduction of the amplitude of the motor action potential of more than 50 per cent, when sustained for longer than seven minutes, caused permanent paraplegia in two cats. The evaluation of spinal evoked potentials that were obtained from epidural electrodes placed caudad to the level of distraction, and of motor action potentials that were recorded over the soleus muscle, following the same stimulus, showed a similar pattern of reduction after distraction in five of seven cats. The other two cats had irreversible reduction of motor action potential associated with unchanged spinal evoked potential, and both cats became paraplegic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "LH receptors were solubilized from human corpora lutea in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. The presence of 20% (vol/vol) glycerol was necessary for quantitative preservation of [125I]hCG-binding activity in detergent solution. The solubilized receptors were stable for several weeks at -20 C and at -80 C and for at least 18 h at 4 C. Binding of [125I]hCG to the soluble LH receptors was time and temperature dependent and varied linearly with the amount of soluble protein. Equilibrium binding studies revealed a single class of high affinity [125I]hCG-binding sites with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.3 x 10(-10) mol/L (at 20 C). The molecular size of the human LH receptors was analyzed by ligand blotting. Solubilized receptors were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. Incubation of the protein blot with [125I]hCG to the 85/90K mol wt species was inhibited by unlabeled hCG. These results indicate that LH receptors can be solubilized in nonionic detergent while maintaining their hormone-binding activity and demonstrate that the receptors contain 85/90K hormone-binding species.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) decreases and serum non-SHBG-bound testosterone (T) increases with age in normal prepubertal boys from infancy to late prepuberty. In this study we measured serum SHBG, T, estradiol (E2), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DS), and we calculated serum non-SHBG-bound T and E2 and free T and E2 in 22 normal prepubertal girls, aged 1-9.4 yr. The girls were divided into 3 groups of different ages: group A, 1.7 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SE) yr; group B, 4.6 +/- 0.8 yr; and group C, 7.3 +/- 0.8 yr. In group C, mean serum SHBG level was lower, and serum T, non-SHBG-bound T, free T, DS, total E2, non-SHBG-bound E2, and free E2 were higher than in group A or B. Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between serum SHBG and age [y(nmol/L) = 144 - 9.07 x (yr); r = 0.57; P less than 0.001], while positive correlations were found between non-SHBG-bound T and age [y(nmol/L = 0.043 + 0.023 x (yr); r = 0.68; P less than 0.001], non-SHBG-bound E2 and age [y(pmol/L) = 0.69 + 2.82 x (yr); r = 0.6; P less than 0.001], and DS and age [y(nmol/L) = 25.2 + 63.8 x (yr); r = 0.59, P less than 0.001]. In a group of 19 normal age-matched prepubertal boys, we also found a significant correlation between non-SHBG-bound E2 and age. Since non-SHBG-bound sex hormone levels are good indicators of tissue available sex hormones, we conclude that in prepubertal girls, there is a progressive increase in the exposure of peripheral tissues to T and E2 with advancing age. Since sex hormones enhance tissue maturation, these increments might play a role in the somatic and psychic development of girls before the onset of the clinical signs of puberty.\r"

In this study we determined whether this process is related to fasting or to hyperketonemia itself. Eight normal postabsorptive subjects were rendered artificially hyperketonemic (approximately 6 mmol/L) by a constant infusion of acetoacetate and exercised moderately for 2 h. The kinetics of ketone bodies were determined with [14C]acetoacetate or beta-[14C]hydroxybutyrate. The metabolic clearance was slightly increased (approximately 25%) at the beginning of exercise, but this phenomenon was subsequently amplified by the progressive fall in ketonemia, which decreased to about 4 mmol/L at the end of exercise. Taking into account the fact that the metabolic clearance of ketones is inversely related to their concentration, it could be estimated that the direct effect of exercise on the metabolic clearance is negligible. Thus, the inability of exercise to enhance the metabolic clearance of ketones at high physiological plasma ketone levels is a general phenomenon that applies to both endogenous and exogenous ketosis.\r"

TSH-stimulated 125I uptake was inhibited by the Ig fractions from 15 patients with atrophic thyroiditis who had serum TSH binding inhibitor Igs (TBII), 10 (62.5%) of 16 TBII-negative patients with atrophic thyroiditis, 7 (43.8%) of 16 hypothyroid patients with goitrous thyroiditis who had no TBII activity, and only 2 (15.4%) of 13 euthyroid patients with goitrous thyroiditis who were negative for TBII. The mean inhibition of TSH-stimulated 125I uptake produced by the crude Igs from the former 3 groups of hypothyroid patients was statistically significant (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.001, and P less than 0.01, respectively) and correlated closely with the ability of the Ig fractions to inhibit TSI-stimulated 125I uptake (r = 0.882) and TSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation (r = 0.929). The inhibition of TSH- or TSI-stimulated 125I uptake by Ig samples containing TBII correlated significantly with the TBII activities. On the other hand, in the presence of Igs from TBII-negative hypothyroid patients, the inhibition of TSH-stimulated 125I uptake correlated significantly with that of forskolin-stimulated 125I uptake (r = 0.685). Although 6 (12.8%) of 47 Ig samples from hypothyroid patients inhibited dibutyryl cAMP-stimulated 125I uptake, the activities were marginal. These findings suggest that at least 2 types of antibodies are involved in the inhibition of TSH- or TSI-stimulated 125I uptake: 1 being a competitive inhibitor of TSH binding to its receptors, and another exerting influence on a step subsequent to TSH or TSI binding, presumably through adenylate cyclase inhibition.\r"

This study tested the hypothesis that an acid-labile subunit (ALS) reacts with the binding subunit to form the 150K complex. ALS activity was quantitated by the conversion of covalent BP-53-[125I]IGF-I tracer from about 60K to about 150K. DEAE-Sephadex chromatography of serum at pH 8.2 yielded separate peaks of 30-60K BP-53 immunoreactivity and 100-110K ALS which, when mixed, converted the BP-53 to 150K. Whole serum also contained 100-110K ALS not complexed with BP-53. ALS was markedly acid labile, irreversibly losing activity below pH 4.5. In an assay involving competition between test substances and BP-53-IGF-I tracer in the reaction with partially purified ALS, serum samples, acidified to inactivate endogenous ALS, reacted with potencies proportional to their immunoreactive BP-53 content. Pure BP-53 alone was inactive, but after preincubation with IGF-I or IGF-II, competed with a potency identical to that of BP-53 in acidified serum. Amniotic fluid IGF-binding protein, with or without IGFs, had no activity. These results confirm that serum contains an acid-labile protein which interacts with the acid-stable IGF-binding protein BP-53, when it is occupied by IGFs, to convert it to the 150K form.\r"

  ".U": "88273461\r", 
  ".W": "The human adrenal gland can metabolize cortisol to yield steroids oxygenated at the 18 position in a series of reactions similar to those by which corticosterone is converted to 18-hydroxycorticosterone and aldosterone and perhaps catalyzed by the same enzyme. These analog steroids, 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol, are produced in small quantities normally, but can be produced in excess by aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas and in glucocorticoid-suppressible aldosteronism. Chronic ACTH administration has been reported to produce a transient increase in aldosterone production. We studied the effect of chronic ACTH administration on the excretion of aldosterone-18-oxoglucuronide and its relationship to the excretion of 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol. Five normal men collected 24-h urine samples for 3 control days and 5 days while receiving ACTH (40 U, im, twice daily). Urinary excretion of tetrahydrocortisol, tetrahydrocortisone, aldosterone 18-oxo-glucuronide, 18-hydroxycortisol, and 18-oxo-cortisol was measured by RIA. Urinary tetrahydrocortisol and tetrahydrocortisone excretion increased 7- to 10-fold during ACTH administration. Urinary aldosterone 18-oxoglucuronide excretion increased to a peak on the second day (6-fold increase) and decreased to basal levels by the fifth day of continuous ACTH administration. The excretion of 18-hydroxycortisol increased about 6-fold and remained elevated throughout the period of ACTH administration. The excretion of 18-oxocortisol increased from an average of 3.7 nmol/day to a peak of 176.7 nmol/day (a 47-fold increase) on the third day and decreased to 107.9 nmol/day on the fifth day of ACTH administration. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the decrease in aldosterone production after 2 days of ACTH administration is the result of induction of 17-hydroxylase by ACTH, resulting in the biosynthesis of cortisol in these cells. Since the cells have the cytochrome P-450-dependent corticosterone methyl oxidase enzyme, cortisol becomes its predominant substrate, resulting in the increase in 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol production. We have called these cells transitional cells because they have enzymatic systems of the zona glomerulosa and the zona fasciculata.\r"

  ".U": "88273469\r", 
  ".W": "Sunlight has long been recognized as a major provider of vitamin D for humans; radiation in the UVB (290-315 nm) portion of the solar spectrum photolyzes 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to previtamin D3, which, in turn, is converted by a thermal process to vitamin D3. Latitude and season affect both the quantity and quality of solar radiation reaching the earth's surface, especially in the UVB region of the spectrum, but little is known about how these influence the ability of sunlight to synthesize vitamin D3 in skin. A model has been developed to evaluate the effect of seasonal and latitudinal changes on the potential of sunlight to initiate cutaneous production of vitamin D3. Human skin or [3 alpha-3H]7-dehydrocholesterol exposed to sunlight on cloudless days in Boston (42.2 degrees N) from November through February produced no previtamin D3. In Edmonton (52 degrees N) this ineffective winter period extended from October through March. Further south (34 degrees N and 18 degrees N), sunlight effectively photoconverted 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3 in the middle of winter. These results quantify the dramatic influence of changes in solar UVB radiation on cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis and indicate the latitudinal increase in the length of the \"vitamin D winter\" during which dietary supplementation of the vitamin may be advisable.\r"

These women were participating in an on-going study to determine the relationship between androgen and estrogen dynamics and osteoporosis. The dynamic measurements were done using constant infusions of [3H] androgen and [14C]estrogen, and the plasma steroid concentrations were measured by RIA. We found that women who were smokers had lower MCRs for androstenedione (A), testosterone, estrone, and estradiol than those who were nonsmokers, but when the data were adjusted for body weight, the MCRs were not significantly different for any of the steroids between smokers and nonsmokers. The mean plasma A concentration was higher in the smokers than in the nonsmokers but plasma testosterone, estrone, and estradiol concentrations were not different. The PB values for all steroids, the interconversions of the androgens and the estrogens, and the peripheral aromatization of the androgens were not different in the 2 groups. These results indicate that smoking does not alter the production and metabolism of androgens and estrogens in pre- and postmenopausal women. However, because the women who smoked were less heavy than those who were nonsmokers, their androgen and estrogen MCRs were lower, leading to a greater plasma A concentration. Our data do not rule out an effect of smoking on other specific pathways of estrogen metabolism.\r"

The existence of this mechanism suggests that maternal hyperglycemia may influence placental transfer of vitamin C. Therefore, we examined the effect of monosaccharides, equilibrated across the membrane, on the uptake of 0.5 mmol/L DHA by placental membrane vesicles. Relative to uptake in the absence of monosaccharide, the rate of DHA uptake was enhanced by up to 90% in the presence of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose equilibrated across the membrane. Comparable results were obtained with D-glucose and D-galactose. An inward-directed monosaccharide concentration gradient inhibited DHA uptake. However, with elevated equilibrium concentrations of monosaccharide, the magnitude of such uptake inhibition was reduced. Relative to DHA uptake at normal blood glucose concentrations (5 mmol/L), the results suggest that moderate maternal hyperglycemia does not alter, but that severe hypo- or hyperglycemia decreases, placental uptake of DHA from the maternal circulation.\r"

Similar cross-reactivity between the benz[a]anthracene and the chrysene adducts was observed. Sera containing antibodies that were apparently specific for each of the three PAH-DNA adducts were also identified.

By day 19 of gestation, no EP mRNA was detected in normal or anemic fetal livers or normal fetal kidneys, but anemic fetal kidneys had low levels of EP mRNA. Newborn through adult stage mice responded to anemia by accumulating renal and hepatic EP mRNA. However, total liver EP mRNA was considerably less than that of the kidneys. Juvenile animals, 1-4 wk old, were hyperresponsive to anemia in that they produced more EP mRNA than adults. Moreover, nonanemic juveniles had readily measured renal EP mRNA, whereas the adult level was at the lower limit of detection. Because of the very low level of fetal EP mRNA, placental transfer of EP was evaluated. When administered to the pregnant mouse, 125I-EP was transferred in significant amounts to the fetuses. These results indicate that in mice the kidney is the main organ of EP production at all stages of postnatal development and that adult kidney may also play some role in providing EP for fetal erythropoiesis via placental transfer of maternal hormone.\r"

In normal brain tissues, the perikarya of astrocytes exhibited a strong positive reaction, whereas the Bergmann glia were stained to a moderate degree. However, no immunoreactivity was observed with neurons, oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and choroidal epithelium. Among the intracranial neoplasms, oligodendroglioma, choroid plexus papilloma, hemangioblastoma, primary malignant lymphoma, neurinoma, meningioma, pituitary adenoma, and craniopharyngioma were all negative. Immunoreactivity in the peripheral neuroblastoma was nil. However, the perikarya of astrocytomas and glioblastomas showed a positive reaction. Analyses on the degree of anaplasia and the amount of apo-E as an intensity of immunostaining showed a negative correlation. The astrocytic elements were stained in mixed oligoastrocytomas and medulloblastomas with glial differentiation. A few cases of ependymomas showed weak perikaryal immunostaining. Western blot analyses with anti-apo E antibody of a freshly prepared surgical specimen with astrocytomas revealed a single band with a molecular weight of approximately 37,000. The well differentiated cultured human astrocytoma cells secreted apo E into the medium. These lines of evidence suggest that apo E may serve as a potential marker specific for astrocytomas and glioblastomas, as well as an indicator of astrocytic tumor cell differentiation. The apo E localization in human brain tumors could be clinically relevant and diagnostically useful.\r"

The activity of a 40,000-mol wt pertussis toxin substrate (alpha G40) was increased by 36% in failing human hearts when compared with nonfailing controls. In contrast, there was no change in the level of the stimulatory regulatory subunit (Gs). The increased activity in alpha G40 was associated with a 30% decrease in basal as well as 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. These data suggest that increased alpha G40 activity is a new marker for failing myocardium and may account at least in part for the diminished responsiveness to beta 1-adrenergic agonists in the failing human heart.\r"

Leucine flux during beta-OHB infusion did not differ from leucine flux during normal saline infusion in nine normal subjects, whereas leucine oxidation decreased 18-41% (mean = 30%) from 18.1 +/- 1.1 mumol.kg-1.h-1 (P less than 0.01), and incorporation of leucine into skeletal muscle protein increased 5-17% (mean = 10%) from 0.048 + 0.003%/h (P less than 0.02). Since blood pH during beta-OHB infusion was higher than the pH during saline infusion, we performed separate experiments to study the effect of increased blood pH on leucine kinetics by infusing sodium bicarbonate intravenously. Blood pH during sodium bicarbonate infusion was similar to that observed during the beta-OHB infusion, but bicarbonate infusion had no effect on leucine flux or leucine oxidation. We conclude that beta-OHB decreases leucine oxidation and promotes protein synthesis in human beings.\r"

  ".W": "1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] increases intestinal calcium absorption through events that include binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the intracellular vitamin D receptor. In vitro studies using mammalian cell cultures reveal an increase in vitamin D receptor content after exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3. To test the hypothesis that 1,25(OH)2D3 increases enterocyte vitamin D receptor content in vivo, male rats were fed either a normal calcium diet (NCD, 1.2% Ca) or low calcium diet (LCD, 0.002% Ca). After 21 d LCD increased serum 1,25(OH)2D3 levels (27 +/- 3 vs. 181 +/- 17 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) and increased transepithelial mucosal to serosal calcium fluxes (Jms) across duodenum (65 +/- 21 vs. 204 +/- 47 nmol/cm2.h, NCD vs. LCD, P less than 0.01) and jejunum (23 +/- 3 vs. 46 +/- 4, P less than 0.007). No change in serosal to mucosal calcium fluxes (Jsm) were observed. LCD increased 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor number threefold in duodenum (32.9 +/- 6.7 vs. 98.7 +/- 13.7 fmol 1,25(OH)2D3/mg protein) and jejunum (34.1 +/- 9.5 vs. 84.9 +/- 7.7) without a change in the receptor affinity for 1,25(OH)2D3 (Kd is 0.17 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.02 nM for NCD and LCD duodenum, respectively). Duodenal polyadenylated vitamin D receptor mRNA determined by Northern blot analysis did not increase appreciably during LCD, suggesting that upregulation in vivo may not be due primarily to increased receptor synthesis. The results of this study indicate that under physiologic conditions as during chronic dietary calcium restriction, increased intestinal vitamin D receptor content accompanies increased calcium active transport. Upregulation of the vitamin D receptor by 1,25(OH)2D3 may result primarily from posttranslational processes that decrease degradation of the receptor with increased receptor synthesis responsible for a negligible portion of the accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "Standard and ion-sensitive microelectrodes were used to identify the basis of electrophysiologic changes that occur in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers superfused with \"ischemic\" solution (40 min) and then returned to standard Tyrode's solution. Maximum diastolic potential (EMDP) decreased (-92.6 +/- 2.4 to -86.0 +/- 4.0 mV; n = 19; P less than 0.001) during exposure to \"ischemia,\" and after reperfusion, rapidly hyperpolarized to -90.0 +/- 4.7 (2 min) and then depolarized to -47.0 +/- 7.5 mV (10 min; P less than 0.001). No significant change in intracellular K activity (alpha ik) was noted throughout. Extracellular K activity (alpha ek) changed only during reperfusion, reaching a nadir at 5 min (3.5 +/- 0.4 to 2.6 +/- 0.5 mM, P less than 0.03), and thus can not account for the decrease in EMDP during reperfusion. Mean alpha iNa increased (8.7 +/- 1.3 to 10.9 +/- 1.9 mM; n = 10; P less than 0.01) during ischemia, but rapidly declined during reperfusion to 5.1 +/- 2.2 mM (10 min; P less than 0.01). Exposure to acetylstrophanthidin (4-5 x 10(-7) M) during the final 10 min of ischemia increased alpha iNa to 19.9 +/- 3.8 mM (n = 5), which was unchanged at 5 min of reperfusion. This suggests that Na-K pump inhibition during ischemia was minimal and that the pump was stimulated early during reperfusion, accounting for the initial transient hyperpolarization. Resting tension did not change significantly during exposure to ischemia; however, return to control Tyrode's solution caused a marked rise to 11.3 +/- 9.9 mg/mm2 (n = 13, P less than 0.001). This is consistent with a calcium overload state during reperfusion. The depolarization seen during reperfusion may result from activation of a Ca-activated, nonselective cation channel or enhanced electrogenic Na/Ca exchange.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms involved in basolateral H/OH/HCO3 transport in the in vitro microperfused rat cortical thick ascending limb were examined by the microfluorometric determination of cell pH using (2',7')-bis-(carboxyethyl)-(5,6)-carboxyfluorescein. The mean cell pH in this segment perfused with 147 mM sodium and 25 mM HCO3 at pH 7.4 was 7.13 +/- 0.02 (n = 30). Lowering bath HCO3 from 25 to 5 mM (constant PCO2 of 40 mmHg) acidified the cells by 0.31 +/- 0.02 pH units at a rate of 0.56 +/- 0.08 pH units/min. Removal of bath sodium acidified the cells by 0.28 +/- 0.03 pH units at a rate of 0.33 +/- 0.04 pH units/min. The cell acidification was stilbene inhibitable and independent of chloride. There was no effect of bath sodium removal on cell pH in the absence of CO2/HCO3. Depolarization of the basolateral membrane (step increase in bath potassium) independent of the presence of chloride. Cell acidification induced by bath sodium removal persisted when the basolateral membrane was voltage clamped by high potassium/valinomycin. Although these results are consistent with a Na/(HCO3)n greater than 1 cotransporter, a Na/H antiporter was also suggested: 1 mM bath amiloride inhibited the cell pH defense against an acid load (rapid ammonia washout), both in the presence and absence of CO2/HCO3, and inhibited the cell acidification induced by bath sodium reduction from 50 to 0 mM. In conclusion, an electrogenic Na/(HCO3)n greater than 1 cotransporter in parallel with a Na/H antiporter exist on the basolateral membrane of the rat cortical thick ascending limb.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of chronic caffeine on the A1 adenosine receptor-adenylate cyclase system of rat cerebral cortical membranes were studied. Caffeine treatment significantly increased the number of A1 adenosine receptors as determined with the A1 adenosine receptor antagonist radioligand [3H]xanthine amine congener (XAC). R-PIA (agonist) competition curves constructed with [3H]XAC were most appropriately described by a two affinity state model in control membranes with a KH of 2.1 +/- 0.8 and a KL of 404 +/- 330 nM with 50 +/- 4% of receptors in the high affinity state (%RH). In contrast, in membranes from treated animals, there was a marked shift towards the high affinity state. In three of seven animals all of the receptors were shifted to a unique high affinity state which was indistinguishable from the KH observed in membranes from control animals. In four of seven animals the %RH increased from 50 to 69% with KH and KL indistinguishable from the control values. Thus, the agonist specific high affinity form of the receptor was enhanced following caffeine treatment. Maximal inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in cerebral cortical membranes by R-PIA (1 microM) was significantly increased by 28% following caffeine treatment, consistent with an increased coupling of receptor-Gi protein with adenylate cyclase. Importantly, the quantity of Gi (alpha i) in rat cerebral cortex, determined by pertussis toxin-mediated labeling, was also increased to 133% of control values by this treatment. Thus, multiple components and interactions of the A1 adenosine receptor-adenylate cyclase complex are regulated by caffeine. These changes are likely compensatory measures to offset blockade of A1 receptors in vivo by caffeine and lead to a sensitization of this inhibitory receptor system.\r"

A few noncommunicating cells were also microinjected (n = 3) or observed within large territories of coupled keratinocytes. Microinjections of dermal fibroblasts demonstrated an extensive coupling (greater than 100 fibroblasts); however, none of the keratinocyte (n = 34) or fibroblast (n = 3) injections revealed coupling between the epidermal and dermal compartments. Cell coupling was found to be more extensive in epidermal ridges than in suprapapillary plates and, in both regions, was less extensive after injection of the basal layer of the epidermis than after that of the suprabasal layers. This study shows that junctional cell-to-cell communications take place in normal and fully differentiated human tissue. The quantitative data gathered also indicate a regional heterogeneity of keratinocyte-to-keratinocyte communication within intact adult skin and the lack of effect of retinoids on this pattern.\r"

The recombinant antigen produced by lambda RAL-1 stimulates proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from O. volvulus infected humans. Lambda RAL-1 is derived from a 1450 bases message that encodes a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 42,000 in adult O. volvulus. The inserted DNA of lambda RAL-1 contains an open reading frame of 1008 bp. The amino acid sequence predicted by this open reading frame contains three repeats of the sequence KKPEDWD.

Each gene was inserted into a bovine papillomavirus shuttle vector under the transcriptional control of the mouse metallothionein gene promoter and the resultant recombinants were transfected into mouse C127 cells. The transfected cells containing the hGH-N gene secrete two hGH proteins, 91% migrating at 22 kD and 9% migrating at 20 kD, the same relative proportions synthesized in vivo by the human pituitary. S1 nuclease analysis of mRNA from these cells confirms that 20 kD hGH is encoded by an alternatively spliced product of the primary hGH-N gene transcript in which the normal exon 3 splice-acceptor site is bypassed for a secondary site 15 codons within exon 3. Although the hGH-V gene is identical to the hGH-N gene for at least 15 nucleotides on either side of the normal and alternative exon 3 AG splice-acceptor sites, hGH-V synthesizes only a 22-kD protein. Reciprocal exchange of exon 3 and its flanking intron sequences between the hGH-N gene and the hGH-V gene, eliminates the synthesis of the 20-kD protein in both resultant chimeric genes. These results directly demonstrate that both the major 22-kD and the minor 20-kD forms of pituitary hGH are encoded by the alternative splicing products of a single hGH-N gene transcript. This alternative splicing is neither species nor tissue-specific and appears to be regulated by at least two separate regions remote from the AG splice-acceptor site.\r"

As this change was due to an elevated recovery of CaM in the organs of the hypertensive animals, the present study was designed to evaluate its activity in hypertension. A CaM activator, detected in heart and kidney supernatants from hypertensive animals, was found to be responsible for this enhanced recovery. Similar results were obtained with passaged, cultured aortic smooth muscle cells from SHR, indicating that the anomaly was not a mere consequence of elevated blood pressure but rather a genetic expression of cells of hypertensive origin. The activator was heat stable, nondialyzable, and recovered in the fraction precipitated with 30-50% ammonium sulfate. Preliminary extraction studies suggest that the activator is contained in a glycolipid fraction. The stimulation of phosphodiesterase by this activator was calcium and CaM dependent. The activator appears to affect the affinity of the phosphodiesterase for CaM rather than the maximal stimulation. The activator was also present at a low concentration in the heart and kidney of normotensive animals. These findings indicate that at least some of the calcium abnormalities implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension could be the result of interactions between CaM, calcium, and this activator.\r"

Studies are now presented in which the mechanisms underlying biliary lipid dependent expression of intestinal apo B48 synthesis have been investigated further. Bile salt replacement was effective in a dose- and structure-dependent manner in reexpressing intestinal apo B48 synthesis after prolonged bile diversion. Further experiments suggested that this effect of bile salt may be related to facilitated uptake of fatty acid. A role for mucosal phospholipid flux was suggested by studies in which infusion of lysolecithin, with or without Na taurocholate, produced complete reexpression of apo B48 synthesis in jejunal enterocytes. Over a four- to sixfold range of apo B48 synthesis rates in both jejunum and ileum, there was no change in apo B mRNA size or abundance as determined by RNA blot hybridization. Analysis of both intestinal mucosa and microsome lipid content in a variety of settings revealed that apo B48 synthesis rates were correlated with microsome triglyceride fatty acid content (r = 0.65, P less than 0.005) but not free fatty acid or phospholipid content. These studies demonstrate a physiologic role for elements of biliary lipid flux in the regulation of apo B gene expression. The data suggest that an integrated mechanism may exist whereby apo B48 synthesis is related to microsome triglyceride flux, particularly at low levels of lumenal substrate availability.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently developed a micropuncture technique to assess repeatedly function of the same nephrons in chronic renal disease and subsequently examine the morphology of their glomeruli by serial thin-section histological analysis. Using this approach, a potential causal linkage between early functional patterns and late structural abnormalities was examined in glomeruli of two established rat models of glomerular sclerosis. The models are (a) puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) administration in unilaterally nephrectomized Munich-Wistar rats and (b) adriamycin (ADM) treatment in nonnephrectomized Munich-Wistar rats. Single nephron GFR (SNGFR) and glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC) were measured repeatedly for 8 (PAN rats) or 31 wk (ADM rats). In all animals studied, values for PGC remained at, or slightly below, levels measured before PAN or ADM administration. SNGFR values declined progressively in all glomeruli in PAN rats. Although some glomeruli in ADM rats had an increase in SNGFR above levels observed in nonnephrectomized control rats, these hyperfiltering glomeruli did not have abnormally high PGC nor did they exhibit glomerular sclerosis at the completion of the study. Histological analysis revealed the existence of a significant inverse correlation between the degree of sclerosis and SNGFR assessed at the time of sacrifice in both PAN and ADM groups. Chronic administration of captopril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, in PAN rats substantially attenuated development of glomerular sclerosis without affecting PGC in earlier stages. The observations in these models indicate that glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertension are not required for the development of glomerular sclerosis in renal diseases, and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor can exert its protective effect independently of its effect on glomerular capillary pressure.\r"

Vitamin D-binding protein enhanced the chemotactic activity of native C5a des Arg, but had no effect on the chemotactic activity of either native C5a or FMLP.

  ".W": "Several serum proteins have been shown to be important in modulating leukocyte chemotaxis and inflammation. We investigated the possibility that the multifunctional serum protein Gc-globulin (vitamin D-binding protein) may also enhance the neutrophil chemotactic activity of complement-derived peptides. Purified Gc-globulin by itself did not induce chemotaxis of human neutrophils. However, as little as 0.01 nM Gc-globulin greatly enhanced the neutrophil chemotactic activity of C5a and its derivative, C5a des Arg over a wide concentration range. The effect was most pronounced at nonchemotactic doses of C5a (0.01 nM) and C5a des Arg (1 nM). Gc-globulin was unable to augment the neutrophil chemotactic activity of FMLP and leukotriene B4. This enhancing activity was not due to a nonspecific effect of anionic proteins since other purified serum proteins, of similar size and charge as Gc-globulin (alpha 1 acid glycoprotein, alpha 2 HS glycoprotein, alpha 2 histidine-rich glycoprotein), could not increase the chemotactic activity of C5a des Arg. Serum depleted of Gc-globulin by immunoaffinity chromatography totally lacked chemotactic enhancing activity for C5a des Arg. Gc-globulin-depleted serum activated with zymosan also had significantly less chemotactic activity than control- (sham-depleted) activated serum. Finally, radioiodinated C5a or C5a des Arg formed a 1:1 complex with purified Gc-globulin when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. These results indicate that Gc-globulin is the major chemotactic enhancing factor in serum and may function as an up-regulator of the chemotactic activity of C5-derived peptides.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical utility for establishing the immune phenotype in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is controversial. To help resolve this dilemma, we studied 104 consecutive patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma, the most common subtype of potentially curable non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The presence or absence of the human class II histocompatibility antigen was determined using the monoclonal antibody anti-HLA-DR (Ia), and the results correlated with pretreatment clinical features and survival. We found that eight HLA-DR negative patients had similar pretreatment clinical characteristics compared with 96 HLA-DR positive patients, but HLA-DR negative patients had a significantly shorter survival duration compared with HLA-DR positive patients (P = 0.003 log-rank). The median survival of the HLA-DR negative patients was 0.5 years compared to 2.8 yr for the HLA-DR positive patients. No HLA-DR negative patient survived beyond 1.5 yr. A multi-variate analysis, adjusting for prognostic factors of known clinical significance, confirmed the importance of HLA-DR as a prognostic factor (P = 0.016). We conclude that determining the presence of HLA-DR is a relatively simple pretreatment study that identifies a small but important group of patients who are not curable using currently available combination chemotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "88273602\r", 
  ".W": "Familial dysautonomia is a hereditary disorder that affects autonomic and sensory neurons. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is required for the normal development of sympathetic and sensory neurons and it has been postulated that an abnormality involving NGF may be responsible for familial dysautonomia. Previous studies have shown that the beta-NGF gene is not linked to the disease. However, NGF appears to be abnormal by immunochemical assays; the putative altered form of NGF could result from a disturbance in the processing pathway. To study the processing of the 35-kD glycosylated NGF precursor and the secretion of NGF in familial dysautonomia, we have employed a recombinant vaccinia virus vector to express high levels of NGF mRNA in primary fibroblast cultures from patients with the disorder; the processing pathway was then studied directly. Cells from several unrelated patients all produce the same 35-kD NGF precursor, process this normally to NGF within the cell, and release NGF into the medium. There are no differences in the ability of cells from patients and from unaffected relatives to process and secrete NGF. The use of similar recombinant vaccinia virus vectors to express proteins at high level in primary cell lines should facilitate the detection of posttranslational processing defects in a variety of human disorders.\r"

  ".W": "To examine putative relationships between adrenergic receptors on accessible circulating cells and relatively inaccessible extravascular catecholamine target tissues, we measured mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) and lung beta-adrenergic receptors and platelet and lung alpha-adrenergic receptors in tissues obtained from 15 patients undergoing pulmonary resection. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured concurrently to explore potential regulatory relationships between the activity of the sympathochromaffin system and both intravascular and extravascular adrenergic receptors. MNL and lung membrane beta-adrenergic receptor densities were correlated highly (r = 0.845, P less than 0.001). Platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor and lung alpha 1-adrenergic receptor densities were not. Lung alpha 1-adrenergic receptor densities were positively related to plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.840, P less than 0.01) and epinephrine (r = 0.860, P less than 0.01) concentrations; in contrast, lung beta-adrenergic receptor densities were not positively related to plasma catecholamine concentrations (they tended to be inversely related to plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine [r = -0.698, P less than 0.05] levels). This apparent reciprocal regulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors by the sympathochromaffin system was only demonstrable with adrenergic receptor measurements in the extravascular catecholamine target tissue. Neither MNL beta-adrenergic receptor nor platelet alpha-adrenergic receptor densities were correlated with plasma catecholamine levels. Thus, although measurements of beta-adrenergic receptors on circulating mononuclear leukocytes can be used as indices of extravascular target tissue beta-adrenergic receptor densities (at least in lung and heart), it would appear that extravascular tissues should be used to study adrenergic receptor regulation by endogenous catecholamines in humans. These data provide further support for the concept of up regulation, as well as down regulation, of some adrenergic receptor populations during short-term activation of the sympathochromaffin system in humans.\r"
