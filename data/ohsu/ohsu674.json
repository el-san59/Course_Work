White women less than 35 years old had twice as many sexual partners during their lifetime (mean of 5.5) as white women greater than or equal to 55 years old (mean of 2.8). Among women greater than or equal to 40 years old, black women had more sexual partners than white women, but among younger women there was little difference by race. Although the number of sexual partners was low compared to homosexual men of the same period, the trends among young women (born 1944 to 1963) to have a higher number of partners and younger ages at the time of first sexual experience indicate that sexual behavior changed in ways that might promote the spread of AIDS and other venereal diseases among women.\r"

Blacks [odds ratio (OR) = 9.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.1-15.9] and Hispanics (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.9-8.8) were at increased risk of HIV-1 infection, relative to non-Hispanic whites. Those who lived closer to New York City, injected drugs more frequently, used intravenous drugs for a longer duration, used shooting galleries, had greater numbers of sexual partners, had human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies, and had the lowest annual incomes were also at increased risk. However, none of these other factors accounted for the black and Hispanic HIV-1 risk in stratified analysis. Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, proximity to New York City, and number of drug injections in the past year each also remained significant, independent risk factors in a multivariate analysis. The increased HIV-1 risk of nonwhite IVDUs remained unexplained. Behavioral, sociologic, and/or biologic factors not identified in this study may modulate HIV-1 transmission dynamics in IVDUs.\r"

Like available antipsychotics, CI-943 reduces spontaneous locomotion in mice and rats and inhibits compulsive cage climbing induced by apomorphine in mice at doses that do not produce ataxia. However, CI-943 enhances rather than inhibits the locomotor stimulant effects of d-amphetamine in mice and rats. Unlike dopamine antagonists, CI-943 does not affect stereotypy caused by apomorphine or amphetamine in rats. CI-943 displays an antipsychotic-like profile in conditioned avoidance tests, inhibiting one-way avoidance in rats at doses that do not impair escape and inhibiting continuous avoidance in rats and squirrel monkeys at doses that do not impair shock termination responding. Although high doses of CI-943 produce dystonic movements in haloperidol-sensitized monkeys, CI-943 differs from dopamine antagonists that produce extrapyramidal dysfunction in humans in that doses of CI-943 that are sufficient to inhibit avoidance responding in monkeys do not produce extrapyramidal dysfunction. Unlike dopamine antagonists that produce tardive dyskinesia, CI-943 administered repeatedly at high doses does not produce behavioral supersensitivity to dopamine agonists in rats. These results demonstrate that CI-943 resembles available antipsychotics in some preclinical behavioral tests commonly used to predict antipsychotic efficacy but differs from dopamine antagonists in tests predictive of dopamine receptor antagonism and antipsychotic-induced neurological dysfunction.\r"

CI-943 (1-40 mg/kg p.o. and 20 mg/kg i.p.) accelerated the turnover of dopamine (DA) in rat brain as demonstrated by the enhancement of levels of the DA metabolites homovanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid or 3-methoxytyramine and by the enhancement rate of DA synthesis in either striatum or mesolimbic regions. These increases in DA turnover induced by CI-943 are not due to DA receptor blockade as CI-943, unlike known antipsychotics, did not exhibit affinity for DA receptors either in vitro or in vivo and did not affect rat serum basal prolactin levels. Amfonelic acid enhanced the action of haloperidol in increasing striatal homovanillic acid with no effect on that of CI-943 and clozapine, suggesting that CI-943, like clozapine, would be predicted to have a low risk of extrapyramidal side effects as compared to haloperidol. Chronic administration of CI-943 (40 mg/kg i.p.) to rats for 28 days did not affect the affinity or number of striatal DA receptors; in comparison haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) caused an increase in number of DA receptors with no change in affinity. Measures of serotonergic function were increased; noradrenergic function was not affected by CI-943, nor did it exhibit affinity for a number of central nervous system receptors in vitro. The molecular mechanism by which CI-943 increases brain DA turnover is not known at this time but appears to be unique in comparison to known antipsychotic agents.\r"

In the present studies, the effects of acute and chronic administration of CI-943 on the electrophysiological activity of A9 and A10 DA neurons were assessed and compared to the effects of DA antagonist antipsychotic drugs. Acute administration of CI-943 did not increase the base-line firing rate (10-20 mg/kg i.p.), did not increase the number of spontaneously active DA neurons (40 mg/kg p.o.) and did not antagonize the effects of apomorphine or amphetamine on A9 or A10 DA neurons (20-40 mg/kg i.p.). A high dose of CI-943 (40 mg/kg i.p.) decreased the firing rate of A9 and A10 DA neurons, an effect that was not antagonized by haloperidol. In contrast, haloperidol increased the base-line firing rate (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), increased the number of spontaneously active DA neurons (0.5 mg/kg p.o.) and antagonized the effects of apomorphine and d-amphetamine on A9 and A10 DA neurons (0.1 mg/kg i.p.). Repeated (21 days) administration of CI-943 (36 mg/kg/day p.o.) did not alter the number of spontaneously active A9 DA neurons but increased the number of active A10 DA neurons. In contrast, repeated administration of haloperidol (0.4 mg/kg/day p.o.) decreased the number of spontaneously active DA neurons in A9 and A10, whereas repeated administration of clozapine (19 mg/kg/day p.o.) decreased the number of active A10 DA neurons but increased the number of active A9 DA neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Saturation of the sites was determined in competition studies using a fixed concentration of [3H]cocaine (2.7 nM) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled cocaine (1 pM-100 microM). Computer resolution of the shallow displacement curve (nH, 0.58) revealed that a two-component binding model [Kd1, 19.2 nM, maximum binding1 (Bmax1), 28.3 pmol/g of tissue; Kd2, 1120 nM, Bmax2, 431 pmol/g of tissue] was statistically preferred over a one-component model (K.50, 283 nM, Bmax, 471 pmol/g of tissue). Binding of [3H]cocaine was NaCl-dependent, with specific binding reduced by 72% when NaCl (100 mM) was omitted from the incubation medium. [3H]Cocaine was displaced stereoselectively by the enantiomers of cocaine and by the diastereoisomers of cocaine and its phenyltropane analog. Cocaine congeners displaced specifically bound [3H]cocaine with IC50 values ranging from 17 nM to over 100 microM in the following rank order of potency: WIN 35,428 greater than WIN 35,065-2 greater than (-)-cocaine greater than WIN 35,981 greater than (-)-norcocaine greater than WIN 35,140 greater than (+)-cocaine, (+)-pseudococaine greater than 3 alpha-tropanyl-1H-indole-carboxylic acid ester greater than 1 alpha H-3 alpha-5 alpha H-tropan-3-yl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate greater than benzoylecgonine, benzoylnorecgonine and (-)-pseudococaine. Several monoamine uptake inhibitors structurally unrelated to cocaine also displaced [3H]cocaine with IC50 values ranging from 1.6 nM to 50 microM. The rank order of potency was: ( +/- )-trans-3-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-1-indanamine greater than mazindol greater than nomifensine greater than methylphenidate 1-[2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]- 4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine, N-[1-(2- benzo(b)thiophenyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine greater than (-)-cocaine greater than 1-amino-4-phenylbicyclo-[2,2,2]-octane greater than bupropion, nisoxetine greater than desipramine, talsupram greater than citalopram. Other drugs, including the dopamine releasing agent (+)-amphetamine and the dopamine receptor agonists (-)-apomorphine, (+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxy-naphthoxazine, quinpirole and SKF 38393 were weak displacers of [3H]cocaine.

Squirrel monkeys were trained to respond under a fixed-interval schedule of stimulus-shock termination, and dose-effect curves were determined by administering cumulative doses i.v. Among the cocaine congeners, (-)-cocaine, (+)-pseudococaine and 1 alpha H, 3 alpha, 5 alpha H-tropan-3-yl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate produced dose-related increases in response rate, whereas (-)-pseudococaine, (-)-benzoylecgonine and (-)-benzoylnorecgonine did not increase responding consistently over a 100-fold or greater range of doses. 1-(2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine, which selectively inhibits uptake of dopamine, and mazindol, methylphenidate, nomifensine and bupropion, which inhibit uptake of dopamine as well as other monoamines, had behavioral effects similar to those of cocaine. In contrast, desipramine and citalopram, which selectively inhibit uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, respectively, produced only dose-related decreases in response rate. The results combined with previous studies demonstrate a close correspondence between the potencies of 15 different drugs for producing cocaine-like behavioral effects and for displacing specifically bound [3H]cocaine in caudate-putamen. These findings are consistent with the view that the behavioral effects of cocaine and related drugs are linked to their actions at specific cocaine recognition sites associated with the dopamine uptake system.\r"

These were the thoracic and abdominal aorta, superior mesenteric, renal, and femoral arteries of both species, and rat tail and cat splenic arteries. Sensitivity to norepinephrine differed by more than a factor of 30 in the rat and 20 in the cat. Rank order of sensitivities were in general similar in the two species. In rat and cat there was a significant correlation between sensitivity to norepinephrine and alpha-1 adrenoceptor affinity and also between sensitivity and receptor reserve, expressed as -antilog (pD2 - pKA). In the rat the contribution of affinity to these differences in sensitivity was greater than that of receptor reserve. In the cat arteries, receptor reserve is the more important factor. These results support the \"variable receptor affinity hypothesis.\" This proposes that the affinity of a receptor can vary, and this may be due to differences in receptor structure, local membrane microenvironment, and extent of influence of intracellular mechanisms. The hypothesis proposes that variation in affinity can have a significant impact on tissue sensitivity.\r"

Activation of sigma receptors inhibits the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from guinea pig ileum myenteric plexus preparations. A study was therefore undertaken to investigate the action of sigma receptor ligands on single neurons. Nicotinic responses to locally applied ACh onto single neurons of the guinea pig ileum myenteric plexus were studied using intracellular recording techniques. DTG and (+)-SKF10047 (N-allylnormetazocine) produced a concentration-dependent suppression of the depolarization of enteric neurons evoked by ionophoresis of ACh. The EC50 values for DTG and (+)-SKF10047 were 4.7 and 3.8 microM, respectively, and were similar to that for hexamethonium (3.2 microM). The inhibition of the ACh-depolarization was not mediated at sigma receptors because (-)SKF10047 and Bridge-DPG (2-imino-1,3H-dibenzo[d,f]-[1,3]-diazepine), which are inactive at sigma receptors, were as potent as DTG and (+)-SKF10047. DTG and hexamethonium (each at 1 microM) were more effective blockers of ACh-induced inward currents at a holding potential of -100 mV than at -40 mV. This voltage dependence is consistent with a channel blocking mechanism. DTG (10 microM) did not affect the depolarization (mediated by 5-HT3 receptors) induced by pressure application of 5-HT onto single neurons. DTG and Bridge-DPG inhibited contractures of the longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparation elicited by dimethylphenylpiperazinium noncompetitively (EC50 values were 8.0 and 12.3 microM, respectively) whereas DTG but not Bridge-DPG inhibited 5-HT-induced contractions of the longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus noncompetitively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Some properties of functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAcChoR) expressed by the PC12 rat pheochromocytoma or the TE671 human medulloblastoma were studied by the use of an isotopic rubidium ion efflux assay. The assay involves active uptake of 86Rb+ via a ouabain-sensitive mechanism to load cells with isotopic tracer and the subsequent release of ion from cells through agonist-activated opening of nAcChoR-coupled ion channels. For either cell line the rate of receptor-mediated ion efflux is time-dependent and falls as duration of exposure to agonist increases. However, dose-response curves for agonist activation of receptor function (or for antagonist blockade of agonist activation) are temporally invariant. Dose-response curves have characteristic shapes for a given agonist, and the relative and absolute potencies of agonists differ between TE671 and PC12 cells. Most notably, nicotine and cytisine are more potent activators of receptor function on the PC12 cell line whereas TE671 cell nAcChoR are more sensitive to activation by isoarecolone and suberyldicholine. PC12 cell nAcChoR are more sensitive to blockade by the classic \"ganglionic\" blockers, mecamylamine and hexamethonium, and by the molluscan substance, neosurugatoxin, than are nAcChoR on TE671 cells. The results, illustrating differences in the pharmacological profiles of drugs acting as functional nAcChoR on TE671 and PC12 cells, suggest that structural differences exist in nAcChoR active site(s) and are consistent with the notion that functional nAcChoR are a heterogeneous family of macromolecules.\r"

  ".W": "Nicotinamide is both a precursor for NAD synthesis and an inhibitor of intracellular NAD hydrolysing enzymes. Overnight treatment of rats with nicotinamide causes dose-dependent inhibition of the Na+/phosphate cotransporter in the renal brush border membrane. Picolinamide is an isomer of nicotinamide that cannot be used for NAD synthesis. Picolinamide was used in the present study to explore the possibility that inhibition of Na+/phosphate cotransport may be related to inhibition of NAD hydrolyzing enzymes. Overnight treatment of rats with picolinamide, administered as a single injection (4 mmol/kg), inhibited Na+/phosphate cotransport by isolated renal brush border membrane vesicles. Like nicotinamide, the inhibition by picolinamide occurred in thyroparathyroidectomized rats, was specific for Na+/phosphate cotransport and was accompanied by a decrease in the apparent Vmax. In contrast to nicotinamide, there was only a small increase (1.5-fold) in renal cortical NAD content after picolinamide treatment. Direct incubation of isolated proximal tubules with thymidine, a potent inhibitor of NAD hydrolysis by intracellular enzymes, produced no change in Na+/phosphate cotransport. Thus, specific inhibition of renal Na+/phosphate cotrasport by picolinamide in vivo is unlikely due to inhibition of NAD hydrolyzing enzymes. It is suggested, based on data from in vitro studies, that a cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism may be involved.\r"

  ".W": "The oxidative and reductive metabolism of the acrolein-glutathione adduct, S-(2,aldehydo-ethyl)glutathione, by rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was characterized. The glutathione-acrolein adduct is oxidized to the respective acid by two different forms of ALDH contained in rat liver cytosol which are distinct from two forms of ALDH present in the mitochondria also capable of oxidizing the aldehyde moiety of the adduct. Extensive kinetic characterization (Km, Vmax and V/K parameters) of the ALDH enzymes suggest that the glutathione-acrolein adduct is oxidized most efficiently by one form of mitochondrial ALDH which is 3.5 to 175 times more active (based on V/K comparisons) than the other forms of mitochondrial and cytosolic ALDH evaluated. The glutathione-acrolein adduct is also subject to reductive metabolism by rat liver ALH. However, the Km value (877 microM) for reduction of the adduct suggests that this would be a minor pathway of metabolism. Collectively, these results indicate that the glutathione-acrolein adduct formed after exposure to acrolein, or as a result of allyl alcohol oxidation and cyclophosphamide metabolism, can be oxidized by hepatic ALDH or ADH, respectively. However, the kinetic parameters for these pathways suggest that micromolar concentrations of this adduct may accumulate before these enzyme systems mediate significant oxidative or reductive pathways of detoxification. The proposition that the glutathione-acrolein adduct may play a role in acrolein-mediated hepatotoxicity is discussed.\r"

Rolipram and CI-930 exhibited biphasic concentration-response relationships for relaxation of carbachol-, histamine- and leukotriene D4-contracted trachea. However, each agent produced a monophasic (sigmoidal) concentration-response curve when tested in the presence of a fixed concentration (3 microM) of the other. The same relationships were observed for inhibition of tracheal peak III PDE isolated via diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. Whereas CI-930 was approximately equipotent inhibiting PDE IIIc and relaxing rolipram-pretreated trachea, rolipram was substantially more potent (EC50 = 0.02 microM) in relaxing CI-930-pretreated trachea than in inhibiting CI-930-pretreated PDE III (PDE IIIRO, IC50 = 2.6 microM). Among a series of PDE inhibitors, there was a highly significant correlation (r = 0.89, P less than .01) between PDE IIIc inhibition (i.e., PDE III in the presence of rolipram) and rolipram-pretreated tracheal relaxation, but not between PDE IIIRO inhibition and CI-930-pretreated tracheal relaxation (r = 0.23). Nine of the PDE inhibitors used in this study have been reported to displace rolipram from a high-affinity binding site in rat brain. A highly significant correlation between relaxation of CI-930-pretreated trachea and displacement of rolipram binding by these agents was observed (r = 0.97, P less than .0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The antitussives carbetapentane, caramiphen, butamirate and dimethoxanate competed with the high-affinity binding of [3H]DM at pH 7.4 with nanomolar Ki values.

The antipsychotic perphenazine competed with low nanomolar Ki values, whereas rimcazole was weaker. The antidepressant opipramol and the benzomorphan (+)2'methoxyphenazocine were the most effective drugs tested, with Ki values of 0.4 nM. By contrast, MK-801 and phencyclidine hydrochloride were very weak competitors for [3H]DM binding. The diphenylalkylamines were the most effective competitors of the calcium channel blocking agents: prenylamine and cinnarizine had Ki values of 17 and 22 nM, respectively. Lidoflazine and hydroxyzine were slightly less potent, but nifedipine and the benzothiazepine diltiazem were much weaker. Potassium channel blockers inhibited DM binding in pharmacologically relevant concentrations: primaquine was the most effective with a Ki of 0.5 microM.

Rats were injected i.p. twice daily with 25 mg/kg of U-50,488H for 4 days. The development of tolerance to the analgesic and hypothermic effects of U-50,488H was almost complete after 4 days of treatment. [3H]Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol (DAMGO), [3H]Tyr-D-Ser-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr (DSTLE) and [3H]ethylketocyclazocine (EK) were used as ligands for mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors, respectively. The binding of [3H]DAMGO to membranes prepared from various brain regions (pons + medulla, midbrain, hypothalamus, corpus striatum and cortex) and spinal cord was unaffected by chronic administration of U-50,488H. The binding of [3H]DSTLE in U-50,488H-treated rats was decreased in spinal cord and increased in corpus striatum. The binding of [3H]EK to membranes prepared from pons + medulla, midbrain, cortex and spinal cord was decreased whereas it was increased in the corpus striatum. The changes in the binding of [3H]DSTLE and [3H]EK after chronic treatment with U-50,488H were due to changes in the maximum binding values and not in the Kd values. The results indicate that, in the rat, chronic administration of U-50,488H results in the development of tolerance to its analgesic and hypothermic effects and down-regulation of kappa and delta opioid receptors in the spinal cord and an up-regulation in the corpus striatum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three important observations were made: 1) A concentration-dependent elevation in HP latency was observed on day 1 (order of potency: DAMGO = SUF greater than MOR greater than or equal to DADLE greater than or equal to ST-91 + MOR greater than or equal to ST-91) with a gradual return to saline-infused values observed for all concentrations of all drugs by 3 to 5 days. 2) The rate of tolerance development, estimated by calculation of the exponential decay half-life from peak day 1 HP, was not different as a function of drug dose. The area under the 7-day tolerance curve (response latency x day) was directly proportional to infusion concentration and to peak HP effect on day 1. These two calculations both suggest that the rate at which the tolerance adaptation of drug occurs to agonist effects is similar for agents acting upon mu, delta and alpha-2 receptors in rat spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intravenous infusion of the kappa opioid receptor agonists, ketocyclazocine (KC) and U-50488H, produced increases in urine flow rate. KC and U-50488H infusion also resulted in a marked and sustained antinatriuresis which was promptly reversed by low-dose naloxone (50 micrograms/kg i.v.), thus suggesting an opioid receptor-mediated action of both agonists. Although these kappa agonists did not produce changes in glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow, efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity increased with the same time course as the antinatriuretic response. To investigate whether the decrease in urinary sodium excretion was mediated via the increase in efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity, experiments were repeated in SHR with prior bilateral renal denervation. These studies demonstrated that similar renal excretory responses (diuresis and a naloxone reversible antiinatriuresis occurred during infusion of KC and U-50488H in renal denervated as were seen in intact SHR. These studies indicate that the renal excretory responses to the kappa opioid agonists KC and U-50488H are not mediated through changes in renal hemodynamics or via a pathway requiring intact renal innervation. Because an antinatriuretic response was observed in renal denervated SHR, this suggests that kappa opioid receptor agonists may influence the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium by additional naloxone-sensitive mechanisms independent of intact renal innervation.\r"

Calmodulin is an important intermediate in the mucosal signal-transduction pathways that regulate intestinal NaCl transport. We tested a selective inhibitor of calmodulin, CGS 9343B, for antidiarrheal activity in two different models of secretory diarrhea. Diarrhea was induced in mice by p.o. administration of castor oil (0.6 ml) and in rats by i.p. injection of PGE2 (150 micrograms). We compared the antidiarrheal effects of CGS 9343B to other prototype antidiarrheal agents including morphine, loperamide and chlorpromazine in the castor oil-induced model of secretory diarrhea in mice. CGS 9343B was the most potent of these agents, eliminating diarrhea in 100% of mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg (p.o.). Morphine, loperamide and chlorpromazine were 3 to 10 times weaker than CGS 9343B. In this model, we measured changes in the amount of feces eliminated (grams) and loss of body weight (grams) as indicators of the rate of intestinal propulsion, based on the assumption that reduced fecal passage and concomitantly smaller weight loss represented reduced propulsion of intestinal contents, or constipation. Although the other agents caused equal degrees of constipation and antidiarrheal activity, CGS 9343B did not exert any significant antipropulsive effects at antidiarrheal doses in castor oil-treated mice. To further differentiate these agents on the basis of antipropulsive activity, we compared them for effects on the rate of transit of a p.o. administered radioactive marker in normal mice (noncastor oil-treated).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies it was shown that the pyridinium species formed by the monoamine-oxidase-catalyzed conversion of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 1-methyl-4-(2'methylphenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2'Me-MPTP) inhibited mitochondrial electron transport at Complex I. In addition, these substances, when incubated with mouse neostriatal slices, caused an increased lactate accumulation. However, it was not clear whether this inhibition could occur within dopamine nerve terminals. In the present study we investigated if dopamine uptake blockers, shown previously to protect against tetrahydropyridine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, would attenuate MPTP- and 2'Me-MPTP-promoted lactate formation in neostriatal slices. 2'Me-MPTP-induced lactate accumulation in neostriatal slices from mice or rats with a lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway was also studied. The dopamine uptake blocker, Win 35,428 [8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-8-methyl-, methylester [1R-(exo, exol)]), attenuated the increased lactate formation caused by MPTP and 2'Me-MPTP. At low concentrations of 2'Me-MPTP (5 microM), the increased lactate production was inhibited completely by Win 35,428. These latter data suggest that at low concentrations of 2'Me-MPTP, the increased lactate accumulation was associated primarily with dopaminergic nerve terminals. Two other dopamine uptake inhibitors, McN 5908 [trans-4-(1,2,3,5,6,10b-hexahydropyrrolo[2,1-alpha]isoquinolin+ ++-6-yl) benzenamine hydrobromide methanolate (4:4:1)] and mazindol [5-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,5-dihydro-3H-imidazo- [2,1-alpha]isoindol-5-ol], also attenuated tetrahydropyridine-induced lactate formation.

  ".W": "Administered i.p. to mice, the selective kappa receptor agonists U-50488H and spiradoline (U-62066) were more potent on the tail-flick than on the hot-plate analgesic assay. Both were more potent after i.s. rather than i.c. administration, a result consistent with earlier demonstrations that tail-flick analgesia is generally dependent upon spinal mechanisms. Intraspinal U-50488H was not effective in elevating rat tail-flick latencies. Both drugs increased the thresholds for cat spinal cord nociceptive neurons to respond to a noxious heat stimulus. However, maximal responses of spinal cord neurons to nociceptive stimuli were not altered. It is concluded that although spinal cord sites may be critical to kappa receptor analgesic mechanisms, the effects are quite distinct from spinal cord effects observed previously with classical narcotic analgesics.\r"

  ".W": "The effects on nociception, blood pressure and heart rate of clonidine administered intrathecally to the lumbar level were determined in conscious rats and in rats anesthetized lightly with pentobarbital. In anesthetized rats, intrathecal (i.t.) clonidine (3.2-32.0 micrograms) inhibited the nociceptive tail-flick reflex and had biphasic effects on blood pressure; lesser doses (1.0-10.0 micrograms) produced depressor effects, whereas a greater dose (32.0 micrograms) produced a marked pressor response. Clonidine also produced biphasic effects on blood pressure in conscious rats, with the dose-response function shifted upward and to the left of that observed in anesthetized rats. The depressor and antinociceptive effects of 3.2 micrograms of clonidine were antagonized by pretreatment with yohimbine (30.0 micrograms i.t.) but not by prazosin (30.0 micrograms i.t.) or by yohimbine (0.1 mg/kg i.v.). Thus, these effects of clonidine are mediated by spinal alpha-2 adrenoceptors. The pressor response to 32.0 micrograms of clonidine (i.t., lumbar) was accompanied by marked bradycardia, and similar cardiovascular effects were observed when this dose of clonidine was administered either i.v. or to the cervical level of the spinal cord. The pressor response to 32.0 micrograms of clonidine (i.t., lumbar) was not reduced significantly by i.t. pretreatment with yohimbine (30.0 micrograms) or prazosin (30.0 micrograms), but was diminished significantly by i.v. pretreatment with yohimbine (1.0 mg/kg), prazosin (0.1 mg/kg) or phentolamine (2.0 mg/kg). Neither chlorisondamine (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) or the V1-vasopressin receptor antagonist [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid), 2-(o-methyl)tyrosine]Arg8-vasopressin (10.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) reduced the clonidine-produced pressor response. After i.t. injection of 32.0 micrograms of [3H]clonidine, peak levels of radioactivity in the blood were observed at 2 min and corresponded to a blood concentration of 38.8 ng/ml. Injection of an i.v. bolus dose (2.5 micrograms/kg) sufficient to produce these blood levels resulted in a transient pressor response. These results suggest that after i.t. administration of greater doses of clonidine, sufficient amounts of the drug are rapidly redistributed systemically to produce pressor effects by stimulation of vascular alpha adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Amiodarone therapy can be complicated by life-threatening pulmonary toxicity and is invariably associated with characteristic morphologic changes in the lung consistent with a severe phospholipidosis. To determine possible mechanisms, this study utilizes a unique in vitro cell culture model of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and demonstrates that amiodarone can directly induce an accumulation of phospholipids within bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (BPAE) cells during the first 24 hr using amiodarone concentrations equivalent to concentrations found in the blood and lungs of human subjects. For example, amiodarone at 7.5 microM during a 24-hr incubation increases [32P]orthophosphate incorporation into phospholipids from 193 +/- 10 X 10(3) dpm/10(6) cells to 266 +/- 19 X 10(3) dpm/10(6) cells (P less than .01). A generalized increase in all phospholipids occurs after amiodarone treatment of the cultured cells; however, several specific phospholipids including phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid and bis(monoacylglycerol) phosphate are all significantly increased to a greater extent than other phospholipids. Furthermore, the data indicate that amiodarone is a potent inhibitor of lysosomal phospholipase A1 and A2 activities derived from the BPAE cells; whereas, amiodarone has no effect on phospholipase A1 and A2 activities from the BPAE microsomal fraction. Thus, this study demonstrates phospholipids accumulate in cultured BPAE cells exposed to amiodarone and provides direct evidence that the drug initiates a specific and nearly complete inhibition of phospholipid degradation by lysosomal phospholipase A1 and A2 suggesting a similar process may occur in vivo in the lungs of subjects with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.\r"

A2 receptor activation was measured by the ability of these adenosine agonists to relax porcine coronary smooth muscle, where the compounds varied in their EC50 values from 4.5 nM (CGS 21680A (2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl) phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine)] to 3.6 microM (CGS 23321 [2 alpha,3 alpha-dihydroxy-1 beta-hydroxymethyl-4 beta-(2-phenylamino-9- adenyl)-cyclopentane]). Nucleoside transport was measured as the nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitive cellular accumulation of [3H]uridine into guinea pig erythrocytes at 22 degrees C. The initial velocity of transport was dependent on substrate concentration and a substrate-velocity curve yielded a Km of 78 +/- 16 microM and a Vmax of 0.31 +/- 0.049 mmol/l of cell water per hr (mean +/- S.D., n = 4). Dipyridamole, a known potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport, blocked cellular [3H]uridine accumulation with an EC50 of 29.4 nM. Whereas a number of the adenosine agonists tested showed little or no inhibition of nucleoside transport, CV 1808 (2-phenylaminoadenosine) inhibited transport with an EC50 of 140 nM. In addition, two carbocyclic derivatives of CV 1808, CGS 23321 and CGS 23302 [(-)2S,3R-dihydroxy-4R-hydroxymethyl-1R-[2-(p-ethoxycarbonyl)- phenylamino-9-adenyl]-cyclopentane) inhibited nucleoside transport with respective EC50 values of 366 and 168 nM. The data suggest that these compounds have a different structure-activity relationship for adenosine A2 receptors and for the site mediating nucleoside transport inhibition.\r"

The effect of impaired renal function, induced by uranyl nitrate administration, on each component of this process was studied in rabbits using diphenylacetic acid. Uranyl nitrate administration produced a decrease in creatinine clearance of approximately 70% and diphenylacetic acid plasma clearance of approximately 35%. In healthy rabbits the primary determinant of diphenylacetic acid net clearance was the very large component of glucuronide renal clearance (14.10 ml/min/kg) compared with glucuronide formation (4.79 ml/min/kg) or glucuronide hydrolysis (2.56 ml/min/kg). Uranyl nitrate treatment reduced both creatinine clearance and the glucuronide renal clearance by approximately 70%. Renal dysfunction had little effect on the hydrolysis clearance of the glucuronide, but reduced its formation clearance by 22.8%. The reduction in plasma clearance of diphenylacetic acid was a function of both the decrease in glucuronidation (60% contribution) and the decrease in renal clearance of the glucuronide (40% contribution). This study supports the futile cycle mechanism of reversible glucuronide conjugation for acyl-glucuronides in general, and provides a mechanism for the impairment of the plasma clearance in renal failure of drugs forming acyl-glucuronides.\r"

The half-maximal saturation of binding sites in both fractions occurred at 10 pM [125I]CYP with maximal binding capacities, in femtomoles per milligram of protein, 70 +/- 10 (S2 fraction) and 110 +/- 25 (M2 fraction). Approximately 80% of binding sites in either membrane fraction exhibited a high affinity for beta-2 selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (Ki = 1.4 +/- 0.4 nM in S2 and 1.8 +/- 0.6 nM in M2; mean +/- S.D. n = 3), whereas remaining 20% of binding sites had a low affinity for this agent (Ki = 2.6 +/- 1.5 microM in S2 and 0.55 +/- 0.2 microM in M2).

Free-AMB exhibited immediate nephrotoxicity with a 44% decrease of the glomerular filtration rate and alteration of tubular cell membrane permeability expressed as increases in urinary pH (6.5 vs. 4.7), potassium fractional excretion (95% vs. 30%) and sodium fractional excretion (26% vs. 4%). Urinary excretion of the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosaminidase was unchanged by free-AMB. Incorporation of AMB into liposomes prevented the toxic effects of free-AMB on glomerular filtration and tubular cells membrane, but significantly increased N-acetylglucosaminidase urinary excretion (380 and 180% in animals receiving 4 and 10 mg/kg of L-AMB, respectively). Absolute AMB urinary excretion during the experiment was unchanged by liposomes and was always less than 1% of the total dose administered. Liposomes alone exhibited no toxicity. These results suggest that liposomes could increase the interaction between AMB and lysosomes leading to an additional mechanism of cellular injury. They admonish close monitoring of renal function and enzymuria in clinical situations in which L-AMB is being used.\r"

In endothelium-intact preparations, angiotensin I and angiotensin II at 10(-8) to 10(-6) M caused dose-dependent contractions, whereas both angiotensins caused much less contractions in endothelium-removed preparations. The contractions induced by angiotensin I and angiotensin II were strongly attenuated by aspirin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) (5 x 10(-5) M), OKY-046 [thromboxane (TX) A2 synthetase inhibitor] (10(-5) M) and ONO-3708 (TX)A2 antagonist) (5 X 10(-9) M). Captopril (10(-6) M) significantly attenuated the contractions induced by angiotensin I but not those induced by angiotensin II. Angiotensin I- and angiotensin II- induced contractions were inhibited markedly by Sar1, Ala8-angiotensin II (10(-9) and 10(-8) M). The present experiments demonstrate that angiotensin I and angiotensin II produce endothelium-dependent contraction in canine cerebral artery via a factor which appears to be TXA2. Angiotensin I may be converted by endothelial cells to angiotensin II, which may activate the cells to produce TXA2 in canine cerebral artery.\r"

All drugs were given s.c. The mu-agonists, morphine and fentanyl, were equipotent against heat and pressure at all intensities. The kappa-agonists, U50,488H and U69,593 also acted against pressure in an intensity-independent fashion. However, their action against heat was intensity-dependent being greatest against \"low\" and least against \"high\" intensity. At \"moderate\" intensities, morphine, fentanyl, U69,593, U50,488H and 2 other kappa-agonists (bremazocine and tifluadom) were equipotent against heat and pressure. The action of tifluadom was stereospecific. Naltrexone (a preferential mu-antagonist) was 10 times more potent in blocking the actions of morphine and fentanyl (as compared to U69,593 and U50,488H) against both heat and pressure. The preferential kappa-antagonists, nor-binaltorphimine and MR 2266, were 5- and 2-fold, respectively, more potent against the kappa-ligands for both heat and pressure. The antagonism of MR 2266 was expressed stereospecifically. Fentanyl and morphine induced a powerful antinociception against electrical stimulation whereas U69,593, U50,488H, bremazocine and tifluadom were completely inactive. Thus, kappa-opioid receptors can mediate antinociception against noxious thermal stimuli. However, in contrast to mu-receptors, this antinociception against heat is intensity-dependent. Kappa-agonists, in distinction to mu-agonists, are inactive against electrical stimulation.\r"

The antinociception induced by kappa- and mu-opioids (applied s.c.) was unaffected by systemic quaternary naltrexone (50 mg/kg) revealing that it is mediated in the central nervous system. All kappa- and mu-opioids produced dose-dependent antinociception upon intrathecal application, in each case reversible by naloxone (5 mg/kg s.c.). However, intrathecal application of naloxone could only partially (by ca. 50%) antagonize the antinociception evoked by systemically applied U50,488H and morphine: this suggests sites of action in brain in addition to spinal cord for both mu- and kappa-opioids. Intraventricular application of mu-agonists produced maximal, dose-dependent antinociception. All kappa-agonists were also active in producing dose-dependent antinociception although curves were shallow and maximal antinociception could not be attained. The action of tifluadom was shown to be stereospecific. Naltrexone was 10-fold more potent in blocking morphine as compared to U50,488H whereas nor-binaltorphimine, a preferential kappa-antagonist, was 6-fold more potent against U50,488H than morphine. Indeed, whereas a dose of 0.2 mg/kg of naltrexone reversed mu-agonist actions, this dose was inactive against all kappa-agonists: the actions of these could be antagonized only by 2.0 mg/kg. These data indicate that in addition to kappa-receptors in the spinal cord, kappa-receptors in the brain can mediate antinociception against noxious heat and pressure.\r"

High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis showed that no significant metabolism of [125I] E-2078 occurred during incubation with brain capillaries for 30 min at 37 degrees C. The binding of [125I]E-2078 to brain capillaries increased with time and the steady-state cell-to-medium concentration ratio was 58.5 +/- 2.6 microliters/mg of protein. Approximately one-fourth of the [125I]E-2078 binding was resistant to acid wash, and showed significant dependence on temperature and medium osmolarity. The acid sensitive binding of [125I]E-2078, which presumably represents surface binding, was saturable and the Scatchard plot gave a maximal binding capacity Bmax = 147 +/- 29 pmol/mg of protein, and a half-saturation constant (KD) = 4.62 +/- 0.59 microM. Pretreatment of brain capillaries with phenylarsine oxide, an endocytosis inhibitor, completely suppressed the acid resistant binding of [125I]E-2078, but did not influence the surface binding of [125I]E-2078. The acid resistant binding of [125I] E-2078 was inhibited by poly-L-lysine and protamine, but not inhibited by insulin, transferrin, dynorphin (1-8), beta-neoendorphin, naloxone or poly-L-glutamate. Moreover, in vivo brain extraction of [125I]E-2078 in rats was 368 +/- 55% higher than that of [3H] sucrose and was significantly inhibited by 1 mM of unlabeled E-2078. These results demonstrate that E-2078 is internalized by brain capillaries via absorptive-mediated endocytosis, which is a polycation-sensitive pathway.\r"

At high plasma levels of TNF-alpha (doses of 120 micrograms/kg of short-term infusions and greater than or equal to 54 micrograms/kg of long-term infusion) the pharmacokinetics of TNF-alpha were practically first order. A plasma T1/2 of 1.2 to 2.1 hr was calculated. However, at low plasma levels (doses of 10-30 micrograms/kg of short-term infusion and 22 micrograms/kg of long-term infusion) the elimination rate increased steadily in dependence on concentration and time. We conclude that at low concentrations of TNF-alpha the pharmacokinetics were not first order. Simultaneous long-term infusion of recombinant human TNF-beta (200 micrograms/kg) in addition to 22 micrograms/kg of TNF-alpha reduces the elimination rate of TNF-alpha, which can be concluded from the elevation of the TNF-alpha plasma levels. Furthermore, there was no time-dependent increase of the elimination rate that was detected without infusion of TNF-beta. Based on these results two different elimination mechanisms of TNF-alpha in rhesus monkeys are postulated: an unspecific, nonsaturable process as well as a specific, saturable mechanism.\r"

In the cerebral cortex, GU decreased to 70 to 80% at 60 min after i.v. administration of CNZ (0.005-1.0 mg/kg), but CNZ did not change the lumped constant, and this effect was diminished completely by the administration of a BZP antagonist, Ro-15-1788 (5 mg/kg). The maximum effect of CNZ on GU (about 30% decrease) was found at 0.1 mg/kg of CNZ, but increasing the dose to 1 mg/kg had very little additional effect. In vivo BZP-R occupancy was measured using [3H]-Ro-15-1788. Receptor occupancy increased from less than 10% at a dose of 0.005 mg/kg up to essentially 100% at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater. ID50 in dose-response curve of the receptor occupancy for CNZ and ED50 in that of decrease in GU were 0.3 and 0.007 mg/kg, respectively . A nonlinear and hyperbolic relationship was observed between the receptor occupancy and the response for the glucose metabolic rate, indicating that BZP exert the maximum glucose metabolic change at a low fractional receptor occupancy (30-40%).\r"

The NK-3 receptor agonists, senktide and DiMe-C7, as well as the endogenous NK-2 receptor ligand, NKA, produced dose-dependent increases in locomotor activity. Substance P, eledoisin, kassinin and physalaemin elevated activity but not dose-dependently. Regression analyses demonstrated that senktide and DiMe-C7 were the most potent and efficacious of the peptides tested. The slopes of the senktide and DiMe-C7 dose-response curves were parallel and differed significantly from the slope of the NKA dose-response curve. Infusions of the endogenous NK-3 ligand, NKB (3.0 pmol in 1.0 microliter), also elicited hyperactivity equivalent to that produced by an equimolar dose of senktide. These and previous findings suggest that activation of NK-2 and NK-3 receptors in the midbrain raphe leads to behavioral arousal through their influence on serotonin neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Both conduction time (CT) and effective refractory period (ERP), absolute and relative to action potential duration (APD), are major determinants of re-entry arrhythmia circuits. We compared the effects of 3 commonly used class I antiarrhythmic agents, lidocaine, mexiletine and quinidine, and of the combination of the latter 2, on APD, ERP, ERP/APD ratio and interventricular CT in 26 in vivo canine hearts. To assess also the frequency dependence of these effects, each measurement was made at multiple steady-state cycle lengths ranging from 600 to 250 msec. A modified contact electrode technique was used to measure both APD and ERP simultaneously and at the same left ventricular site. Interventricular CT was measured as the interval from the stimulus of right ventricular paced beats to the upstroke of the ensuing left ventricular action potential. Lidocaine did not change APD, ERP and ERP/APD ratio significantly at any basic cycle length. In contrast, both mexiletine and quinidine increased the ERP/APD ratio, with progressively greater effects toward shorter cycle lengths. The quinidine/mexiletine combination increased the ERP/APD ratio significantly more than either drug alone (cycle length 350 msec: 8.3 +/- 2.2% quinidine; 17.6 +/- 7.0% mexiletine; 35.3 +/- 9.6% mexiletine/quinidine combination, P less than .01 vs. quinidine, P less than .05 vs. mexiletine). CT increased only with quinidine but not with mexiletine or lidocaine. Combination of mexiletine and quinidine caused no further slowing of conduction as compared to quinidine alone. Thus, although both ERP/APD ratio and CT are related to sodium channel conductance, drug effect on one parameter does not necessarily imply quantitatively similar effects on the other.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both compounds were considerably less active at A1 receptors with CGS 21577 and CGS 21680C having respective IC50 values of 0.76 and 3.1 microM. The former compound was thus 59-fold selective for A2 receptors whereas CGS 21680C was 140-fold selective. In contrast, the reference A2 selective ligand, CV 1808 (2-phenylaminoadenosine), showed only 8-fold selectivity as an A2 ligand, having an IC50 of 115 nM in the [3H]-5'N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine assay and an IC50 of 910 nM at the N6-[3H] cyclohexyladenosine site. Further examination of CGS 21680C showed that the compound was without effect on binding to 17 other putative neurotransmitter/neuromodulator sites indicating its selectivity as an adenosine receptor ligand. In an isolated perfused working rat heart model, CGS 21680C effectively increased coronary flow with an ED25 value of 1.8 nM. The corresponding value for CGS 21577 was 3 nM whereas that for CV 1808 was 110 nM. The EC25 for eliciting bradycardia for all three compounds was greater than 1000 nM.

Cocaine (300 nM-30 microM) caused a concentration-dependent hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, with a maximum effect of 13.3 +/- 2.2 mV (N = 6) and an EC50 of 4.2 microM. This action was antagonized by spiperone (1 microM), suggesting that the hyperpolarization was mediated indirectly through endogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Cocaine (300 nM) increased the time constant for decay (tau 2) of the 5-HT inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) from 432 +/- 57 msec to 708 +/- 81 msec (N = 14); 10 microM increased tau 2 by about 9-fold. Amphetamine (100 nM-10 microM) caused a depolarization that was antagonized by prazosin (100 nM). In slices taken from reserpine-treated animals (5 mg/kg, 12 hr), the 5-HT-mediated IPSP, the noradrenaline-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential and the amphetamine-induced depolarization were absent. These results indicate that the amphetamine-induced depolarization resulted from the release of endogenous noradrenaline. In the presence of prazosin (100 nM), amphetamine caused a hyperpolarization at a threshold concentration of 10 microM, had an EC50 of 26 microM and a maximum effect of 10 +/- 0.9 mV (N = 8). This hyperpolarization as well as the cocaine-induced hyperpolarization were not reduced by prior treatment with reserpine. Amphetamine (10 microM) caused a 2.2-fold increase in the time constant of decay of the IPSP with no change in the amplitude.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Partial agonists and antagonists exhibited similar apparent affinities in intact cell competition binding assays with either the lipophilic radioligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB) or the hydrophilic radioligand [3H]N-methyl scopolamine [( 3H]NMS). In contrast, full agonists exhibited markedly lower apparent affinities in intact cell competition binding assays with [3H]QNB than with [3H]NMS. The affinities of agonists and antagonists in competition for [3H] NMS binding to intact cells were slightly higher than those observed in competitions for [3H]QNB binding in cell lysates. In contrast, the affinities of agonists in competition for [3H]QNB binding to intact cells were considerably lower than those in competition for [3H]QNB binding in cell lysates. Treatment of cells with antimycin A to deplete intracellular ATP prevented agonist-induced internalization of muscarinic receptors as assessed by sucrose density gradient assays of receptor subcellular distribution. In ATP-depleted cells, the apparent affinities of full agonists vs. [3H]QNB were markedly higher and were similar to their apparent affinities vs. [3H]QNB in cell lysates. The apparent affinities of partial agonists and of antagonists were unaffected by ATP depletion. ATP depletion decreased slightly the apparent affinity of the full agonist carbachol in competition for [3H]NMS binding to intact cells, whereas the apparent affinity of atropine was unchanged. These results provide evidence for an agonist-specific, ATP-dependent low affinity state of intact cell muscarinic receptors that may be similar to those observed previously for both beta and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors and that may be related to receptor internalization/sequestration.\r"

Chronic Thiry-Vella loops, constructed in six dogs, were perfused with an isosmotic neutral perfusate containing [14C]polyethylene glycol as the recovery marker. Fluxes of water, sodium, chloride and potassium were calculated and immunoreactive serotonin levels were measured in blood and effluent perfusates. Intraluminal application of 20 micrograms of cholera toxin induced secretion; fluxes of water (basal, 32.3 +/- 11.1; 6 hr, -541 +/- 35 microliter/min), sodium (basal, 9.0 +/- 2.8; 6 hr, -78.3 +/- 5.6 microEq/min), chloride (basal, 3.8 +/- 1.5; 6 hr, -65.7 +/- 4.0 muEq/min) and potassium (basal, 0.10 +/- 0.08; 6 hr, -2.80 +/- 0.18 muEq/min) were all significantly different from basal. Serum electrolytes remained normal, except that potassium fell from 4.9 +/- 0.5 to 3.9 +/- 0.2 mEq/l. Although circulating serotonin levels did not change from base line (180.9 +/- 29.3 ng/ml), effluent concentrations increased significantly from 68.2 +/- 4.6 to 81.1 +/- 5.0 ng/ml (at 3 hr) and jejunal outputs increased from 136.6 +/- 10.2 to 205.1 +/- 10.1 ng/min (at 6 hr). In a separate set of experiments, verapamil was infused i.v. (12.5 micrograms/kg/min) during the 4th hr in four dogs exposed to cholera toxin. The lower dose of toxin (5 micrograms) induced secretion which was unaffected by the calcium channel blocker. In another series of studies, ketanserin (a 5-HT2 receptor blocker) was infused i.v. at 33 micrograms/kg/min during the 4th hr in four additional dogs exposed to the lower dose of cholera toxin. This potent serotonin antagonist failed to inhibit cholera toxin-induced jejunal secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to determine the mechanism of action underlying relaxation of vascular smooth muscle induced by ammonium ions. In particular, the possibility that these ions might be an endothelium-derived relaxing factor was examined. Rings of large canine femoral, mesenteric and coronary arteries and of small arteries from the gracilis muscle were suspended in organ chambers for the recording of isometric force. Membrane potential was recorded with intracellular microelectrodes in smooth muscle cells from the mesenteric artery. Ammonium ions induced relaxation which were independent of the presence of the endothelium. The relaxations were not prevented by adrenergic, serotonergic, muscarinic and histaminic blockers, by scavengers of oxygen-derived radicals or by inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase. The relaxations were prevented by a decrease in extracellular calcium concentration and by inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the relaxation induced by ammonium ions is related to changes in intracellular pH and, at high concentration of these ions, possibly to activation of the Na+/K+ pump. Ammonium ions are neither the endothelium-derived relaxing factor which activates guanylate cyclase nor the factor that induces endothelium-derived hyperpolarization. Inasmuch as relatively low concentrations of the ion induce relaxation of small arteries of skeletal muscle, they could contribute to exercise hyperemia.\r"

The concentrations of these reagents causing 50% inhibition of serotonin uptake were 3.75 mM, 10 microM and 5 microM, respectively. The inhibition of N-acetylimidazole was reversible with hydroxylamine and the inhibition by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole was reversible with 2-mercaptoethanol. Kinetic analysis of serotonin uptake in control and in N-acetylimidazole-treated membrane vesicles revealed that the treatment decreased the maximal velocity of the transport system with virtually no effect on the affinity of the transporter for serotonin. Similarly, the treatment did not change the affinity of the transporter for Na+. Even though serotonin uptake was reduced in treated vesicles compared with control vesicles at all concentrations of Na+, in both cases the dependence of the uptake rate on Na+ concentration was hyperbolic, indicating the involvement of one Na+ per transport of one serotonin molecule. The serotonin transporter could be protected from the N-acetylimidazole-induced inhibition by Na+. It is concluded that tyrosyl residues are essential for optimal transport function of the human placental serotonin transporter and that these critical tyrosyl residues are located at or near the Na+-binding site.\r"

Of the seven clones examined, the M1 muscarinic receptor densities in these cells characterized by (-)[3H]methyl-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([-)-[3H]MQNB binding ranged from 12 fmol/10(6) cells in LK3-1 cells to 260 fmol/10(6) cells in the LK3-8 cells. Carbachol/(-)[3H]MQNB competition curves for the LK3-1 cells (with low receptor density) had a Hill coefficient close to unity. The competition curves for carbachol in the clones with higher receptor densities had Hill coefficients less than 1 and were best fitted by a computerized nonlinear least-squares regression program for the two-site model. The percentage of the M1 muscarinic receptors which had high affinity for carbachol decreased as the receptor density increased, suggesting that the presence of endogenous factors in these cells may be important for the agonist affinity state of the receptor. Concentration-response curves for carbachol-stimulated [3H]inositol monophosphate [( 3H]IP1) accumulation were also obtained. A significant correlation was observed between the density of M1 muscarinic receptor with high affinity for carbachol and the maximum [3H]IP1 accumulation in these cells. There is no significant difference among the EC50 values and the dissociation constant of high-affinity state values of the carbachol/(-)[3H] MQNB competition curves. These results suggest that the high-affinity state for carbachol may be the functional state of the M1 muscarinic receptors in these transfected B82 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Between Jan 1, 1984, and Dec 31, 1986, 273 such patients were seen. The results of the repeat smears obtained prior to colposcopy were compared with those of colposcopically directed biopsies and of follow-up. The repeat smear was negative in 99 patients; it disclosed squamous atypia in 84, CIN 1 in 64 and CIN 2 or 3 in 26. Thirty-two patients whose repeat smear was negative had biopsy-documented CIN 1-3. Of the 84 patients with squamous atypia, 37 (44%) had biopsy-documented CIN 1-3. Thus, second smears in this group failed to disclose precancerous lesions in at least 69 patients. Of the 90 patients whose repeat smear were interpreted as showing CIN, 64, or 71%, had biopsy-documented CIN 1-3. Patients with a repeat smear showing CIN 1 or greater and normal colposcopy or a negative cervical biopsy must be followed closely: 33% of our study group (6 of 18) were found to have CIN later.\r"

However, similar doses of relaxin had no effect on oxytocin-, prostaglandin E2- or prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced contractions. Only when the doses were increased fivefold to sixfold, to nonphysiologic levels, did relaxin inhibit the action of these oxytocic agents. The effect of relaxin was the same throughout pregnancy. This finding helps explain the two paradoxical roles of relaxin: it inhibits spontaneous myometrial contractility during pregnancy and thus preterm labor but is able to facilitate labor at term through its cervical ripening action without inhibiting the oxytocin- and prostaglandin-driven contractions of parturition.\r"

Forty-one patients (57%) responded favorably to the anticholinergics, and 31 (43%) did not. The 31 discontinued the anticholinergics and were placed on sympathomimetics (phenylpropanlamine, 25 mg two times a day) for another four weeks before repeating their evaluation. Based on urethrocystometry, two groups were identified: group I (n = 44) had bladder contraction that preceded any urethral pressure change, and group II (n = 28) had urethral relaxation that preceded bladder contraction. Most women in group I (38 or the 44 [86%]) responded favorably to anticholinergics. Most women in group II failed to respond to anticholinergics, while more than two-thirds of them (19 of 28 [68%]) responded favorably to sympathomimetics (P less than .001). Our results suggest that bladder contraction that precedes any urethral pressure change represents detrusor pathology as opposed to bladder contraction that follows urethral relaxation: it probably represents urethral pathology.\r"

Following subtotal proctocolectomy for familial polyposis coli complicated by a colonic and rectal carcinoma, patient 2 developed, at age 24, a grade 3 endometrial carcinoma in the absence of any risk factors; she was still alive three years postoperatively despite the subsequent development of a grade 3 astrocytoma in the left temporal region. Patient 3 presented at age 32 after ten years of amenorrhea with the clinical features of the Stein-Leventhal syndrome and abnormal uterine bleeding related to a grade 1 endometrial carcinoma; she also had focal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in situ of the endocervix. Patient 4, who had no risk factors, developed a grade 2 endometrial carcinoma at age 34 despite constant use of combined oral contraceptives for one year and intermittent exposure to them for the previous ten years. Endometrial carcinoma is a rare but important cause of abnormal uterine bleeding in young women; the prognosis can be improved only by prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy.\r"

To isolate cell lines from metastases of estrogen receptor-negative mammary carcinomas in dogs, we applied a novel method using medium supplemented with serum treated to inactivate growth factors. Under these conditions, autonomously growing tumor cells are selectively allowed to proliferate. In this way, four autonomously growing tumor cell lines were obtained from metastases of two dogs. Tumors formed from cells implanted in C3H nude mice closely resembled the original dog tumors, indicating that the main result of this selective procedure was suppression of normal cell proliferation. Serum treated to inactivate growth factors seems to be an important medium supplement for isolation of autonomously growing tumor cell lines, which may be valuable tools for future studies on regulation of cell proliferation in advanced hormone-independent mammary tumors.\r"

The effect of STS on the pharmacology and toxicity of CDDP was investigated in patients receiving at each treatment 90 mg of CDDP/m2 intraperitoneally, with STS given concurrently on alternate cycles by the intravenous route. The patients received a total of 38 courses of therapy, 21 without STS and 17 with STS. STS reduced the total exposure to diethyldithiocarbamate-reactive CDDP for the peritoneal cavity and plasma by 36% and 25%, respectively. When given alone, CDDP caused a statistically significant acute reduction in creatinine clearance levels; this reduction was less evident when STS was given. We conclude that, whereas STS does reduce systemic exposure, the magnitude of this effect was not sufficient to account for the ability of STS to protect against high-dose CDDP.\r"

Patients reported higher prevalence of cancers other than the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and skin cancers (relative risk = 3.3, P less than .001) and were more likely than controls to burn when exposed to the sun (for nonblacks, relative risk = 1.7, P = .01). The latter difference may reflect a manifestation rather than a precursor of the disease. We found no consistent or biologically plausible differences between patients and controls with respect to types of jobs held, or to occupational or vocational exposures to chemicals. These findings do not support the hypothesis that persistent antigenic stimulation by contact allergens is etiologically important in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides.\r"

  ".U": "90012252\r", 
  ".W": "Gallbladder epithelium is unique among the gastrointestinal cell types because proteins and protein levels in the fluid bathing the luminal side of the cells (bile) are different from and can be compared with those in the fluid bathing the basal side (serum). To help identify cellular changes that occur during the development of gallbladder cancer, we obtained gallbladder tissue, serum, and bile specimens from 20 patients with invasive adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder, three with high-grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ), six with low-grade dysplasia, 12 with hyperplasia, and 10 with acute or chronic cholecystitis. We obtained serum samples from 40 patients with invasive adenocarcinoma and bile samples from 29 of these patients; serum samples from three with high-grade dysplasia and bile specimens from two of these; serum and bile samples from five with low-grade dysplasia; serum or bile samples from 126 with metaplasia, hyperplasia, or cholecystitis, including serum samples from 121 and bile samples from 110; and serum and bile samples from eight with normal biliary tracts. The study was conducted in Mexico City, Mexico, and La Paz, Bolivia. We performed flow cytometric DNA analysis on gallbladder tissue specimens and measured levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 antigen in the serum and bile specimens. Analysis of the cell cycle compartments by flow cytometry revealed marked variations of the proliferation index for the different disease states (P less than .0001). The proliferation index increased with progression from cholecystitis to invasive adenocarcinoma. Of the bile and serum measurements, only serum CA 19-9 values were correlated with flow cytometry measurements (r = -.49, P = .005). Overall, the serum and bile measurements were in agreement (P less than .01). However, with the exception of the correlations among serum measurements for the patients with invasive adenocarcinoma, most of the correlations could be explained by differences in the disease state. In particular, the progression from normal tissue to invasive adenocarcinoma involved no change in bile CA 19-9 level and only a slight change in bile CEA level but much larger changes in serum CEA and CA 19-9 levels. It appears that the progression from normal tissue to invasive adenocarcinoma results in increased production of these antigens and often in loss of cell polarity as well, i.e., inability to prevent leakage of the antigens into the serum.\r"

  ".U": "90012263\r", 
  ".W": "The mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 225 IgG1 against the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor has been investigated for its capacity to localize in human tumor xenografts. The EGF receptor is the product of the c-erb-B proto-oncogene (also known as EGFR). Elevated expression of EGF receptors has been demonstrated in many human tumors and tumor cell lines. We studied A431 human vulvar squamous cell carcinoma cells, with 2 X 10(6) receptors per cell; MDA-MB-468 (MDA 468) human breast adenocarcinoma cells, with 3 X 10(5) receptors per cell; and MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, with 5 X 10(3) receptors per cell. The 111In-labeled pentetic acid (DTPA), derivative of mAb 225 (111In-DTPA-225) was injected intraperitoneally into nude mice bearing subcutaneous tumor xenografts. We measured uptake by quantifying radioactivity in tumor and normal tissues and by obtaining gamma camera images. Uptake in A431 xenografts was 28% +/- 2.4% of the injected dose per gram of tumor on day 3 and 12.4% +/- 3.0% on day 7. Distribution ratios comparing uptake in the tumor with that in normal tissues were consistently greater than 4. In contrast, there was far less uptake of the control mAb KS1/4S-1 labeled with 111In. This conjugate, 111In-DTPA-KS1/4S-1, has an IgG1 isotype but does not bind to human or murine cells. Imaging of the tumor with mAb 225 was excellent, especially on days 3-7. MDA 468 xenografts exhibited reduced localization of mAb 225 in the tumor. For MCF-7 xenografts, the tumor uptake of mAb 225 after 7 days was only 0.70% +/- 0.10% of the injected dose per gram of tumor, which was comparable to the uptake of the KS1/4S-1 control mAb. The ratio of the concentration of radioactivity in the tumor to that in normal tissue (distribution ratio) showed poor selectivity of uptake, and imaging was not obtained. These observations suggest that labeled mAb can target the product of a proto-oncogene, the EGF receptor, when it is expressed at high levels in human tumor xenografts.\r"

There was no association between current smoking and risk of breast cancer (multivariate-adjusted relative risk for smokers of greater than or equal to 25 cigarettes/day compared to nonsmokers: 1.02, 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.22). Past smoking also was unrelated to breast cancer risk (relative risk, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.20). The results did not differ by menopausal status. Tumor size and the presence of nodal metastases were unrelated to smoking. Smoking was weakly associated with estrogen receptor-positive tumors (relative risk for smokers of greater than or equal to 25 cigarettes/day compared with never smokers, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.84), but there was no dose-response relationship across categories of current smoking. These results suggest that smoking and breast cancer are not materially related.\r"

From 1960-1964 to 1980-1984, the 5-year relative survival increased from 34.2% to 47.1% in males and from 48.7% to 56.9% in females. The mean loss of expected life among cancer patients decreased from 9.6 to 7.0 years. During the first 5 years after diagnosis, the cancer-specific hazard rate decreased by 34% in males and 30% in females. Thus several analytical approaches revealed a substantial increase in cancer patient survival since 1960.\r"

In addition, it was about 10 times more inhibitory than beta-carotene. Northern blot analysis indicated that alpha-carotene caused maximum suppression of the level of the N-myc messenger RNA of GOTO cells. This suppression occurred within 18 hours of alpha-carotene treatment, after which the level of the N-myc messenger RNA gradually recovered to the basal level. Analysis by flow cytometry indicated that when GOTO cells were exposed to alpha-carotene, they were arrested in the G0-G1 phase of their cell cycle. However, as the level of the N-myc messenger RNA was recovering, these cells resumed normal cycling. These results indicate that the reduction in the level of the N-myc messenger RNA caused by alpha-carotene is closely linked with G0-G1 arrest.\r"

With the use of finely minced tumor preparations from eight different tumor types, recombinant interleukin-2, and lymphokine-activated killer cell-conditioned medium, lymphocytes were expanded in vitro. After 4 weeks, the tumor cells were virtually absent from the cultures. At this point, the lymphocytes were termed \"tumor-derived activated cells\" (TDACs). Over 90% of the TDACs from each of the different tumor types were T lymphocytes, and the percentage of cells expressing either CD4 or CD8 varied considerably from population to population. The lymphocytes showed specific cytolytic activity in melanoma and colon and renal cell carcinomas. Continued expansion and long-term growth of the TDACs, as well as maintenance of the cytolytic activity, were achieved by periodic stimulation of the TDACs with irradiated autologous tumor cells. In a clinical study of 28 patients with cancer, we generated a mean number of 1.2 X 10(11) TDACs in an average time in culture of 69 days. These TDACs were subsequently infused into the patients with cancer. TDACs appear to represent an important resource for biotherapy of patients with cancer.\r"

The success rate of the mammary cancer transplantation to isogenic male SHN or C3H mice was lower in the sialoadenectomized animals, and growth of the grafted tumors was delayed after gland removal. Some tumor development resumed in the hosts that received mouse epidermal growth factor after surgery. Therefore, we believe this growth factor may play a role in the multistage process of mouse mammary carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Five basic models of chemical dependency and their treatment implications are described. The moral model, although disdained by most treatment professionals, actually finds expression in over half the steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. The learning model, albeit the center of the controlled drinking controversy, is also utilized by most abstinence-oriented programs. The disease model, which enjoys current popularity, sometimes ignores the presence of coexisting disorders. The self-medication model, which tends to regard chemical dependency as a symptom, can draw needed attention to coexisting disorders. The social model emphasizes the importance of environmental and interpersonal influences in treatment, although the substance abuser may endorse it as a justification to adopt a victim's role. A sixth model, the dual diagnosis model, is presented as an example of how two of the basic models can be integrated both to expand the treatment focus and to increase treatment leverage. Whereas the five basic models are characterized by a singular, organizing treatment focus, the dual diagnosis model is viewed as an example of a multifocused, integrative model. It is concluded that effective therapy requires (a) flexibility in combining elements of different models in order to individualize treatment plans for substance abusers, and (b) careful assessment of both the therapist's and the substance abuser's beliefs about treatment models in order to insure a treatment match based on a healthy alliance.\r"

We examined whether different comorbid personality disorders have prognostic specificity. Rates of depression and alcoholism as well as assessments of specific problems were measured in a 2.5-year follow-up of 150 treated opioid addicts. Using DSM-III criteria, we found that borderline personality disorder predicted more depressive disorders and alcoholism at follow-up; yet greater recovery from these disorders was seen. Borderline patients had more severe psychiatric problems as measured by the Addiction Severity Index. Other ASI outcomes differed by personality disorder; antisocial addicts had more legal problems, and narcissistic addicts had more medical problems. These results suggest that treatment for opiate addicts be tailored to the specific needs of the patients, which can be predicted, in part, by their comorbid personality disorder diagnosis.\r"

Yet methadone maintenance falls short in a variety of ways; methadone clients continue to use drugs, experience high rates of psychopathology and alcoholism, and fail to become employed and integrated into the community. These problems are endemic in addicts, but also can be attributed to a host of strategic and tactical failures in methadone maintenance treatment itself. Traditional counseling is an inadequate and confused way to provide clients with the living skills, psychotherapy, and limit setting they need. S.T.A.R. is a methadone program in Portland, Oregon, that emphasizes direct training of educational, recreational, and personal skills. Group treatment is employed to create social support for clients while psychotherapy and crisis counseling are available on an as-needed basis. Implementation of the model has caused some difficulties and has led to creative and promising results.\r"

Alarm is also appropriate in consideration of the consequences of the neglect of personal and relational information for the individual addict as well as for society and culture. A clarification of this is given in this article by an explanation of the problems that lie behind addiction. Information about this has been derived from long-term intensive psychodynamic psychotherapies of addicts and their families of origin. It involves a phenomenological description of the intrapsychic and interpersonal psychopathology behind the addiction phenomenon. An explanatory theory of the origin of addiction is not given, nor are the findings placed into diagnostic categories.\r"

Only 3% of the men with benign prostatic hyperplasia had prostate specific antigen levels greater than 10 ng. per ml. compared to 44% of the men with proved prostate cancer. Preoperative prostate specific antigen levels increased with higher clinical stages of prostate cancer but there was substantial overlap among stages. Among patients with stage A1 prostate cancer who were followed expectantly none had an elevated prostate specific antigen value or metastatic disease during a followup of 15 to 120 months. After radical prostatectomy serum prostate specific antigen values decreased to undetectable levels (less than 0.6 ng. per ml.) in 89% of the patients with organ-confined disease, in 87% of those with microscopically positive margins only but in only 34% with seminal vesicles or lymph node involvement. Failure of the prostate specific antigen levels to decrease to the undetectable range after radical prostatectomy was associated with a greater likelihood of subsequent tumor recurrence. Only 3 of 18 patients (17%) treated with definitive radiation therapy had post-irradiation prostate specific antigen values of less than 0.6 ng. per ml., while in 39% the prostate specific antigens values remained greater than 4 ng. per ml. and in 4 of 18 (22%) the values were greater than 10 ng. per ml. Of patients with previously untreated stage D2 prostate cancer the mean pre-treatment prostate specific antigen value was 63.7 ng. per ml. compared to a post-hormonal therapy mean value of 31.1 ng. per ml. Of 32 patients treated with hormonal therapy 14 had stable disease, including 13 with prostate specific antigen levels of less than 10 ng. per ml. In contrast, 18 patients had progressive disease, of whom 16 had prostate specific antigen levels of more than 10 ng. per ml. We conclude that the serum prostate specific antigen assay is most useful clinically to monitor the response to therapy of prostate cancer patients.\r"

A complete assessment of mineral metabolism was performed after 45 and 90 days. Mean basal calciuria was 357 mg. per 24 hours and a significant decrease was noted after 45 days (245 mg. per 24 hours) and 90 days (240 mg. per 24 hours), with a p value of less than 0.01. Urinary oxalate did not vary significantly (0.34 to 0.38 to 0.31 mMol. per 24 hours) and neither did phosphate levels (1,020 to 900 to 893 mg. per 24 hours). A slight and pathologically insignificant decrease was noted in serum iron and urinary magnesium; this fact could be considered a side effect owing to the nonselective binding properties of fiber. Therefore, the positive results achieved confirm the effective action of wheat bran in the treatment of correctly diagnosed absorptive hypercalciuria.\r"

  ".W": "Needle biopsies are being performed commonly as a substitute for open biopsy in certain patients in whom a tissue diagnosis is necessary to determine therapy. During the last few years the Biopty gun and its through-cut needle have evolved as a satisfactory method to perform prostate biopsy in a rapid and painless manner. To determine whether the Biopty gun could be used to perform testicular biopsies 7 patients underwent this procedure in an outpatient setting. The patients received cutaneous lidocaine and the special through-cut needle (already inserted in the gun) was inserted painlessly through this cutaneous wheal towards the tunica albuginea of the testis. The gun was fired and in less than a fraction of a second a biopsy was obtained. The needle was removed and the tissue was placed in Bouin's solution. In some patients more than 1 biopsy was performed. None of the biopsies took more than 5 minutes, none of the patients required postoperative analgesia and none felt untoward discomfort during the biopsy. All biopsies obtained adequate tissue to diagnose the presence of sperm. These results demonstrate that needle biopsy of the testis with the Biopty gun system is a cost-effective, rapid, safe, relatively harmless and effective way to obtain a testicular biopsy to identify the presence of sperm. With time this percutaneous method may supercede other open and percutaneous methods of testicular biopsy.\r"

Doxepin was given at bedtime in a single 50 mg. dose for the first 2 weeks and, if needed, the dose was increased with 25 mg. in the morning for the last week of the 3-week treatment period, which was followed by 2 weeks of washout before crossover. The preference for doxepin to placebo was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Doxepin caused a significant decrease in the nighttime micturition frequency and the nighttime incontinence episodes (p less than 0.05). Urine loss at the standardized 1-hour pad weighing test decreased significantly during treatment with doxepin although statistical significance (p equals 0.07) was not obtained. Cystometric parameters (first sensation and maximum cystometric capacity) improved significantly during treatment with doxepin (p less than 0.06 and less than 0.04, respectively). Side effects were frequent but mild. Suggestions for use of this tricyclic antidepressant in women with detrusor overactivity and possible mechanisms of action are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90012377\r", 
  ".W": "We evaluated urodynamically 14 patients with a continent ileocecal urinary reservoir. Reservoirs were constructed of detubularized right colon alone (4 patients), or augmented with ileum (2) or with a U-shaped ileal patch (8). All reservoirs were placed in the abdomen and used plicated terminal ileum as the efferent continence mechanism. Twelve patients are completely continent with intermittent catheterization at 4 to 8-hour intervals. Two patients suffer mild nighttime incontinence. Mean reservoir volume was 675 ml. Intermittent intestinal contractions were noted in the plicated ileal segment and reservoir but they occurred more frequently in the former and were either synchronous with or preceded those in the reservoir. Mean and maximal contraction pressures were 24 and 47 cm. water, respectively, in the reservoir and 40 and 151 cm. water, respectively, in the plicated ileal segment (p equals 0.043 and less than 0.001, respectively). The highest reservoir contractions occurred in the 2 patients with nocturnal incontinence. The method of construction bore no consistent correlation with mean or maximal contraction pressures, contraction frequency or continence. Careful urodynamic assessment suggests that the ileocecal urinary reservoir is a relatively low pressure, nonrefluxing and continent bladder substitute. The plicated terminal ileal segment acts as an effective sphincter that responds to pressure elevations in the reservoir. Its simple construction and easy catheterization make it an attractive alternative to intussuscepted ileal segments.\r"

Four patients demonstrated the rare entity of an opening at the tip of a pseudophallus and 2 also had an accessory urethra in association with the cloacal malformation. These children exhibited some form of masculinization of the external genitalia with the accessory urethra or cloacal channel assuming a phallic position in an enlarged clitoris. No adrenal, metabolic or chromosomal abnormalities were detected and virilization was limited to the genitalia. These cases illustrate the greater predilection of these patients to more complex congenital malformations than patients with an isolated cloaca. The posterior sagittal approach has been used effectively for repair of these congenital malformations.\r"

The mean intracorporeal pressure obtained was 85.9 mm. Hg during erection and 21.6 mm. Hg at detumescence. The systemic arterial pressure obtained was 102 mm. Hg at full erection.

A plastic cylinder was placed over the penis and suction applied until the gauge pressure was -100 to -200 cm. H2O. The intracavernous pressure decreased within one to three seconds to between -60 and -120 cm. H2O followed by a gradual increase as a result of blood flow into the corpora cavernosa. The intracavernous pressure recovery was 50% after 17 seconds and 100% by 30 to 60 seconds. These effects could also be observed when the penile base was partially constricted with a rubber band before applying the partial vacuum. Tumescence resulting from suction disappeared immediately when suction was terminated unless the base of the penis was constricted before and after the application of vacuum. In the latter case tumescence was prolonged (cavernous pressure between 60 and 120 cm. H2O) after suction. The cross-sectional area of the penis expanded to more than 150% of the flaccid state. The increase of intracavernous pressure from intracavernous papaverine injection was similar to that after suction with a constricting rubber band in place at the base of the penis. Subatmospheric pressure induces an expansion of the penis followed by increased blood inflow. The additional volume can be kept in the penis only if a constriction device is placed at the base of the penis. The tumescence induced by suction is passive, occurring without evidence of smooth muscle relaxation or release of neurotransmitters.\r"

  ".W": "Focused acoustic shock waves were studied for their effects on human tumor cell viability, clonogenicity, and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. The elastic shock waves used in this investigation were generated with the Dornier HM3-Lithotripter by underwater spark discharge with fixed electrical parameters employing a voltage of 18 kV and a capacitance of 80 nanoFarads. These waves are characterized by a fast varying compression phase, strong asymmetrical pressure and tension phases, and a maximum amplitude of roughly 10(8) Pascal (kg.m-1 s-2). Doses as high as 2000 focused shocks showed little effect on the viability of two different cell lines. There was, however, a dose dependent inhibition of tumor cell proliferation as determined by the growth of clones in soft agarose. Each of the two cell lines showed a unique degree of colony inhibition by shock waves. It was demonstrated that shock wave effects resulted from elastic shock wave interaction with the cells and were not caused by the emission of ultraviolet light coincident with shock wave generation. Shocks were applied at a rate of 100 minute-1 in a 200 l. water bath, thereby removing the possibility for temperature changes during treatments. After treatment with shock waves it was found that tumor cells became more sensitive to growth inhibition by chemotherapeutic agents. Cisplatin, doxorubicin, and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide were each more effective in blocking cell growth after the target cells had been treated with acoustic shocks. Enhanced efficacies ranged from three to 10-fold potentiation of colony inhibition. These results indicate that weak shock waves, which can be focused to a defined target region, may have utility as a cancer treatment modality either alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents.\r"

  ".W": "The solubility of uric acid and the stability of supersaturation of monosodium urate (NaU) were studied in buffer solutions containing 150 mM sodium in the physiological urinary pH range at 37C. The solubility of uric acid increased with the rise in pH, and the total dissolved urate (undissociated uric acid + urate anion) concentration did not change during seven-day incubation in the pH range below 6.6. In this pH range, the calculated concentration of undissociated uric acid was constant (about six mg./dl.). Consequently, the increasing solubility of uric acid with the rise in pH depended solely on the increase of urate anion. As much as 220 mg./dl. of uric acid could be dissolved for 24 hours at pH 7.0. But following seven-day incubation the total dissolved urate concentration decreased to 16 mg./dl. due to NaU crystallization. The stability of NaU supersaturation depended not only on the concentration of sodium and urate anion but also on time and pH. When monopotassium urate crystals were incubated for seven days, the total dissolved urate concentration decreased according to NaU crystallization; the higher the pH, the more marked the decrease. However, at least some 80 mg./dl. of total dissolved urate was stable up to pH 8.2 within 24 hours. These findings can well explain why NaU crystals are seldom formed in the normal urine. Urinary stasis and/or pathological high urinary pH may cause NaU crystallization.\r"

[3H]Dihydroalprenolol was the ligand used for determining the total density of beta-adrenergic receptors. The beta-1 and beta-2 subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors were defined by inhibition of [3H]DHA binding by ICI 89,406, a beta-1 selective antagonist, and ICI 118,551, a beta-2 selective antagonist. Saturation studies with [3H]DHA showed that there was no significant difference in the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, and the maximum number of binding sites Bmax, between the upper and lower renal pelvis. Although the inhibition constants of ICI 118,551 were smaller than those of ICI 89,406 in both the upper and lower pelvis, indicating a predominance of beta-2 receptors in both regions, the Ki values of ICI 118,551 were significantly greater in the upper than in lower pelvis. These data suggest that there are significant amounts of beta-adrenergic receptors in the rabbit renal pelvis without regional differences in the total density of beta receptors and that there is a greater proportion of beta-2 subtypes in the lower than in the upper renal pelvis.\r"

The change of the size of the implanted tissue as well as the histology of the tissue were determined six days later. Untreated control tumors were used to determine the evaluability of the individual assays using criteria based on 1) tumor growth (an increase in tumor size or a decrease not exceeding 0.05 mm.) and 2) tumor histology (presence of carcinoma cells in at least 70% of the tissues). The first criterion was fulfilled in 20/24 (83%) of the renal tumors; tumor histology was satisfactory in 9/24 (38%) of the tumors. Taken together, only 9/24 assays were considered to be evaluable. Discrepancies between measurement and histologic appearance were also found for individual tumors and for treated tumors. Due to the lack of correlation between measurement and histology change in tumor size therefore cannot be considered a reliable parameter for assessing viability or drug activity.\r"

The metal cap also offers the advantage of effectively blunting the sharp fiber tip and improving its visualization under fluoroscopy. Plasma shield lithotripsy using a 200 micron quartz fiber inserted into a section of a modified 0.034 in. diameter stainless steel guide wire was tested in vitro on a variety of calculi and compared with results obtained using a 200 micron laser fiber applied directly. Calculi tested included cystine, struvite and calcium oxalate dihydrate urinary stones and pigmented cholesterol gallstones. The laser source was a flashlamp-pumped dye laser producing pulses of 1.2 microsecond duration and operated at a wavelength of 504 nm and pulse repetition frequency of 5 Hz. The results show that plasma shield lasertripsy is as effective as direct lasertripsy for fragmenting gallstones, struvite and calcium oxalate dihydrate calculi, is potentially safer, and can fragment cystine calculi which the pulsed dye laser applied directly cannot.\r"

  ".W": "The cell proliferation of bladder tumors was assessed via an immunohistochemical technique using anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) antibody. The incorporation of the thymidine analogue, BrdUrd, into DNA synthesis phase was performed by an in vitro labeling technique. The percentage of labeled S-phase cells was expressed as the labeling index (LI). Discrimination between BrdUrd-labeled and unlabeled cells was easy because of the absence of background staining. The average LI obtained using this method in normal, normal epithelium bearing bladder tumors and cystitis was 5.0%, 4.0% and 5.0%, respectively. On the other hand, LI in bladder tumors was 13.0%, while the difference from non-malignant bladder epithelium was significant. As in high grade tumors, the labeled cells distributed throughout both the basal and surface layers of epithelium, compared to low grade tumors and controls. However, there was some variation in the distribution pattern within the same tumor depending on the histological site. On the other hand, the higher S-phase fraction was found in high grade or invasive bladder tumors. Bladder tumors with lymph node involvement had higher LI than those without the involvement. In patients who underwent TUR, the LI was as high as 10.0% in the recurrent group compared with 7.3% in the non-recurrent group. Moreover, in the total cystourethrectomy group, higher LI's were obtained in a patient dying of cancer (20.0%) and a patient with postoperative metastasis (21.0%) than in the non-recurrent group (14.8%). The high frequency of S-phase cells within tumor tissue appears to indicate a more malignant potential and thus a poor prognosis. Although further studies are required for its full significance, the measurement of BrdUrd labeling index by in vitro labeling method promises to afford useful information regarding the biological behavior of bladder tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of adrenergic activity in the penis was investigated by studying human and rabbit corpus cavernosum strips in organ chambers and measuring the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerve terminals. Electrical field stimulation of corporal strips caused frequency-dependent contractions which were potentiated by cocaine and attenuated by the alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (10(-7) M), but not by the alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (10(-7) M). Norepinephrine caused concentration-dependent contractions of corporal strips, which were attenuated by prazosin and rauwolscine. Acetylcholine and physostigmine attenuated adrenergic nerve mediated contractions and also significantly reduced electrically-induced norepinephrine release. These effects were reversed by atropine. Atropine alone enhanced electrically-induced norepinephrine release. Rauwolscine inconsistently enhanced adrenergic nerve mediated contractions but augmented norepinephrine release caused by electrical stimulation. The alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine inhibited electrically-induced norepinephrine release. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) attenuated adrenergically-mediated contractions, but had no effect on electrically-induced release of norepinephrine. It is concluded that: 1) contraction of corporal smooth muscle is mediated by postjunctional alpha 1 adrenoceptors; 2) adrenergic activity is modulated by prejunctional alpha 2 adrenoceptors and cholinergic nerves via prejunctional muscarinic receptors; and 3) the putative nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmitter, VIP, has no apparent role in the regulation of adrenergic nerves.\r"

  ".W": "Normal rats as well as rats with bladder hypertrophy secondary to outflow obstruction were investigated cystometrically before and after administration of the potassium channel openers pinacidil or cromakalim one mg./kg. orally. In normal rats cromakalim decreased micturition pressure by 15 +/- 6%. A diminished micturition pressure was also seen after pinacidil (by 18 +/- 8%) but this did not achieve statistical significance. Further, no clear-cut effects on bladder capacity, residual volume, basal bladder pressure, threshold pressure, bladder compliance or on bladder wall tension were seen in this group of rats neither in the presence of pinacidil nor cromakalim. Rats with bladder hypertrophy exhibited a significant bladder instability during cystometrical investigations. The mean amplitude of the spontaneous bladder contraction exceeded 20 cm. H2O prior to micturition. Administration of pinacidil and cromakalin decreased the spontaneous contractions to 26 +/- 12% and 22 +/- 7%, respectively, of that seen in the absence of the drugs. Furthermore, pinacidil decreased micturition pressure by 61 +/- 12%. Also cromakalim decreased micturition pressure (by 27 +/- 13%) but this effect did not achieve statistical significance. After both pinacidil and cromakalim these rats tended to develop residual urine. In accordance with the results in normal rats pinacidil and cromakalim showed no effects on bladder capacity, basal bladder pressure, threshold pressure, bladder compliance or on bladder wall tension in rats with bladder hypertrophy. The findings of an almost complete disappearance of spontaneous bladder contractions in rats with bladder instability and a remaining voiding ability after administration of pinacidil or cromakalim suggest that potassium channel openers may be a therapeutic alternative in the treatment of bladder instability associated with outflow obstruction.\r"

There were 13 male and 7 female patients, and the highest incidence was in the second decade. Although most patients presented with symptoms typical of pheochromocytoma, several presented with unusual features related to the anatomical location, such as mediastinal mass (chest tumor), upper airway obstruction (neck tumor) or gross hematuria (bladder tumor). In 5 of 6 patients in whom plasma catecholamine levels were fractionated epinephrine levels were elevated. The most common tumor location was the superior para-aortic region (13 patients). In 16 patients the location of tumors was established before treatment. Computerized tomography (9 patients) was the most accurate imaging study for tumor localization. A total of 19 patients underwent complete excision of all pheochromocytomas. Postoperative followup information (median interval 120 months) was available for 15 of these patients. Three patients had recurrent pheochromocytoma that was treated successfully. One patient had essential hypertension. No patient had metastatic disease. The low incidence of malignancy suggests a benign course for extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma and represents a departure from the previously reported higher incidence of malignancy with extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma.\r"

Two stones each of cystine-R and cystine-S, calcium oxalate monohydrate, calcium oxalate dihydrate, struvite plus apatite and brushite were fragmented with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and the fragmentability was compared. Fragments resulting from cystine-R and cystine-S extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy were examined under the stereoscope to assess the plane of cleavage or fracture. Results show that cystine-R stones are comprised of well formed blocks of hexagonal crystals, whereas cystine-S calculi have small, irregular and poorly formed interlacing crystals. The center of cystine-R stones was similar to that of the periphery but the center of cystine-S stones was formed of blocks of hexagons similar to but smaller than the cystine-R calculi. Fragmentation with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy revealed that cystine-S stones are the least fragile, calcium oxalate dihydrate and struvite plus apatite were the most fragile, and cystine-R, brushite and calcium oxalate monohydrate calculi were in the intermediate fragility range. The possibility of the patient having a cystine-R calculus should be considered during therapeutic procedures.\r"

Size (less than 1 cm.) and location of the stone (caliceal and nonobstructive) did not explain the severity of the symptoms nor would they have been an indication for an operation. In 8 patients treated by an open operation, 16 treated percutaneously and 6 who underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy the procedure time, success rate, complication rate and length of hospitalization were analyzed. Followup consisted of ultrasound and/or a plain film of the kidneys, ureters and bladder 1 day and 3 months postoperatively. A nephrotomogram was included in group 3 patients. Of 30 patients 3 had persistent stone fragments for more than 3 months: 2 underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy and 1 was treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. A total of 28 patients (93.3 per cent) achieved complete or significant relief of pain. In the percutaneous group both patients with persistent fragments were symptomatic in contrast with the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy group, in which 1 patient presented with stone fragments but was free of pain. The group treated percutaneously had a shorter procedure time (60 minutes) and the shock wave group had a shorter hospitalization. On the other hand, the open operation group had a better success rate as well as relief of pain. These observations showed that small, nonobstructive caliceal stones can be responsible for persistent, severe flank pain. Since extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is an effective noninvasive procedure that does not require routine anesthesia and hospitalization, with prompt return of the patient to normal life, it must be considered the method of choice in these particular patients.\r"

  ".U": "90012411\r", 
  ".W": "Accurate preoperative evaluation of the inferior vena cava and renal vein in patients with renal cell carcinoma is mandatory to plan a successful surgical approach. The presence of venous extension may alter transfusion and anesthetic requirements, as well as require the addition of a vascular surgeon to the operative team. Venacavography traditionally has been considered the most reliable method to identify tumor thrombus, although magnetic resonance imaging has been proposed as a possible noninvasive alternative. We compared prospectively the accuracy of these 2 methods in 44 consecutive patients with renal cell carcinoma who subsequently underwent nephrectomy. Of the 44 patients 11 (25%) had tumor extension into the inferior vena cava and 17 (39%) had involvement of the renal vein at operation. Venacavography and magnetic resonance imaging correctly identified 9 of the 11 patients (82%) with inferior vena caval thrombus. When the results of both tests were combined, all 11 cases of vena caval extension were identified. Venacavography was slightly more sensitive (71%) in identifying the presence of renal vein thrombus than magnetic resonance imaging (65%) but these differences were not statistically significant. Magnetic resonance imaging better localized the thrombus within the renal vein. We conclude that venacavography and magnetic resonance imaging offer equal diagnostic accuracy in the identification of venous extension of renal cell carcinoma. The combination of both tests results in higher diagnostic yield than either test alone. Neither test by itself is reliable in the presence of a large, bulky adenopathic lesion that compresses the inferior vena cava.\r"

The majority of the patients (70 of 110, 63.7%) were treated for distal stones alone, whereas in a third (40 of 110, or 36.3%) treatment was performed for distal and upper stone localization during the same session. Additional treatment besides extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was necessary in 12.7% of the patients. Of the 110 patients 89.4% were without residual stones after a mean of 17.3 days. This modified position of the patient, which is specific to the Dornier HM-3 lithotriptor, makes possible treatment of distal ureteral stones with results comparable to those of endoscopic management but with less major complications (4.7%). A total of 7 patients had anal blood loss in the early postoperative period. Rectal bleeding ceased within 36 hours after treatment. The position also allows for treatment of stones at other, more proximal locations without great modifications to the position during the same session.\r"

Transitional cell carcinoma developed subsequently in the distal urethral remnant in 5 patients (4.0%) followed for 2.6 to 5.7 years (mean 4.1 years) postoperatively. These 5 patients originally had nonpapillary, multifocal and histologically high grade (5) and low stage (4) bladder cancer, 4 with associated carcinoma in situ. Our results suggest that simultaneous total urethrectomy should be considered strongly for patients with high grade nonpapillary multifocal bladder cancer associated with carcinoma in situ. Furthermore, the pattern of distal urethral recurrence in our patients may provide information regarding the appropriate management of the male urethra in potential candidates for continent urinary diversion.\r"

To address these shortcomings and to increase current knowledge regarding postoperative adjustment, we completed a prospective, longitudinal study of 19 implant recipients and their partners. Our results suggest that most patients and partners were satisfied with the prosthesis 1 year postoperatively, although use of the prosthesis sometimes was accompanied by short-term complications. Satisfaction tended to be lower among spouses than patients. Frequency of sexual intercourse increased during the followup period but there were no changes in sexual desire. Neither marital nor psychological adjustment changed significantly during this period.\r"

Among 1,236 consecutive impotent patients investigated at our center 5.3% had serum levels of prolactin greater than normal. Only 34 of the 66 hyperprolactinemic patients were available for analysis. The etiology of the hyperprolactinemia in this group was pituitary adenoma in 14.7%, drug-induced in 29%, chronic renal failure in 6%, laboratory error in 2.9% and idiopathic in 47.1%. Medical management has a high degree of success but simply lowering the levels of prolactin is not invariably accompanied by restoration of function.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of invasive testicular cancer is increased in men with a history of cryptorchidism. Previous studies based on relatively small series indicated that the risk of carcinoma in situ of the testis also is increased in these men. In our study 500 consecutive men 20 to 30 years old, who were previously admitted to a department of surgery with the diagnosis of testicular maldescent, were asked to participate in a screening for carcinoma in situ of the testis. Of the men 300 consented to testicular biopsy. The biopsies were evaluated by light microscopy for carcinoma in situ and other histopathological abnormalities. Carcinoma in situ was diagnosed in 5 patients (1.7%, 95% confidence limits 0.5 to 3.9%). However, the true risk of carcinoma in situ might be higher, since 2 men who had been treated for testicular cancer before they were offered biopsy were excluded from the study. Advanced spermatogenesis, including the spermatid stage in all tubules, was found in biopsy specimens from only 37% of the men. In 80% of these specimens even the number of late spermatids was decreased. Thus, our study, based on a large number of testicular biopsies from an unselected group of men with testicular maldescent, provided further evidence that these men have an increased risk for carcinoma in situ of the testis. Our data combined with the results of other Scandinavian studies indicate that the true prevalence of carcinoma in situ in men with a history of cryptorchidism is approximately 2 to 3%. Additionally, we confirmed that spermatogenic function is severely impaired in maldescended gonads. Invasive testicular cancer can be prevented if the neoplasm is detected at the stage of carcinoma in situ. In our opinion the magnitude of prevalence of carcinoma in situ found in men with a history of cryptorchidism justifies that these men should be offered testicular biopsy when they reach adulthood.\r"

Infrarenal aortas were collected from 19 patients (age 70 +/- 7 years) undergoing operative repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (diameter 7 +/- 2 cm) and from 13 autopsies (age 63 +/- 17 years) of patients without aneurysm disease (controls). Wall thickness and collagen and elastin concentration were determined in full-thickness aorta. Collagen types I and III were measured after digestion with cyanogen bromide, which solubilized nearly 90% of total collagen for typing. Cyanogen bromide peptides were separated by sequential carboxymethylcellulose and agarose chromatography and quantified by peak area measurement with computerized image analysis. Histologic examination revealed prominent inflammatory cell infiltration and deficient, fragmented elastin in the aneurysms. Aortic wall thickness was similar in aneurysms and in control specimens. In the aneurysms, collagen was increased (37% +/- 16% vs 24% +/- 5%; p less than 0.05) and elastin was decreased (1% +/- 1% vs 12% +/- 7%; p less than 0.001), expressed as a percentage of delipidized, decalcified dry weight. Collagen type I accounted for 74% +/- 4% of aneurysm and 73% +/- 4% of control collagen solubilized for typing, and collagen type III accounted for 26% +/- 4% of aneurysm and 27% +/- 4% of control collagen solubilized for typing. Neither patients with a family history of aneurysms nor those without a history of aneurysms had collagen type III deficiency. Atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysms are associated with an inflammatory process and may result from elastin degradation and not a deficiency of type III collagen.\r"

In 23 patients, random halves of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, used for lower limb arterial reconstructions, were seeded with endothelial cells at a seeding density of 3500 cells/cm2. These cells were derived from the saphenous vein by enzymatic harvesting. The other half was sham seeded with culture medium. Graft thrombogenicity was estimated by measuring platelet deposition on graft surface 1 and 6 months after surgery, with indium 111-labeled platelets and external gamma-camera imaging. Seeded graft segments accumulated significantly (p less than 0.03) fewer platelets at all imaging times. It is concluded that seeding of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts in humans reduces graft surface thrombogenicity. The clinical implications of this remain to be demonstrated.\r"

Before atrial pacing all were considered to be at low risk of a postoperative cardiac event based on assessment of clinical parameters. Vascular surgery was subsequently performed in 47 patients. In these patients, pacing-induced ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm occurred in 18, a fixed perfusion defect occurred in 11, and a reversible defect occurred in six. Two of the six patients with reversible perfusion defects had preoperative coronary angiography; both had significant coronary artery disease (one or more lesions greater than or equal to 50%). Two patients (one of whom had a reversible perfusion defect) underwent preoperative coronary revascularization and tolerated subsequent vascular surgery well. All other patients received only medical therapy. None of the 47 patients undergoing vascular surgery had a postoperative cardiac event (unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or cardiac death). Of the 14 patients in whom vascular surgery was deferred or canceled, surgery was canceled for noncardiac reasons in seven. Six of these seven patients had a normal perfusion scan; none had a reversible perfusion defect or marked (greater than or equal to 2 mm) ST segment depression. No cardiac event occurred during a 3-month period after atrial pacing in any of these patients. Six of the remaining seven patients had reversible perfusion defects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the role of hemodynamic factors on low-density lipoprotein transport and metabolism in the intact arterial wall. Freshly excised canine carotid blood vessels were exposed to well-defined pulsatile flow in vitro for continuous periods up to 20 hours. We chose to impose the following hemodynamic conditions on our test carotid arteries: normotension, hypertension (at physiologic flow conditions), and hypertension coupled with elevated flow of canine serum perfusate. In several experiments the effect of endothelial denudation was examined in carotid arteries exposed to normotensive pulsatile flow. A trapped ligand method was used for quantitating low-density lipoprotein uptake and metabolism in the arterial wall. The distribution of both intact and degraded low-density lipoprotein fractions was determined from measurements of radiolabelled low-density lipoprotein activity within thin radial sections of perfused arteries. Our results suggest that both hypertensive hemodynamic simulations exacerbate the uptake of low-density lipoprotein within the arterial wall (by a factor of three to nine). The percentage of low-density lipoprotein that undergoes irreversible degradation falls from 41% under normotensive conditions to below 30% when hypertensive conditions are imposed, indicating that degradative processes are not proportionally elevated with the accelerated influx. A similar pattern is observed for deendothelialized vessels.\r"

This concept, which takes foot vessel involvement into account in patients with only one patent crural artery, is a modification of the traditional method of runoff assessment. Good runoff was defined as patency of two or three lower leg arteries to the foot or one patent, vessel continuous with intact anterior or posterior foot arch. In limbs with no patent vessel or one patent vessel with deficient or occluded foot arches, the runoff was classified as poor. The cumulative primary patency rates at 12 months in groups with good and poor runoff were 81% and 37%, respectively. The predictive value of the new method was superior to that of other comparable methods (traditional method, Society for Vascular Surgery and International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery criteria, and modified Society for Vascular Surgery and International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery criteria). This improved prediction can be ascribed to the optimal angiographic technique for visualizing distal vessels, selective evaluation of foot vessel runoff with a new concept, and the criteria used to define good and poor runoff.\r"

  ".W": "Between August 1983 and December 1987, 23 patients received a 30-minute intraoperative, intraarterial infusion of streptokinase (seven patients) or urokinase (16 patients) because of residual thrombus or persistent ischemia or both after thromboembolectomy. Ages ranged from 21 to 77 years (mean, 58 years). In 15 patients intraoperative lytic therapy was part of the initial operation, whereas in eight patients intraoperative lytic therapy was performed during a secondary operation to treat thrombosis of a recently placed graft. Seven patients in the latter group had hypercoagulable conditions (five had heparin-induced thrombosis; one had protein C deficiency; one had polycythemia with thrombocytosis). Improvement after intraoperative lytic therapy was seen on angiography performed after infusion in 13 of 17 (76%) patients in whom angiography was performed both before and after intraoperative lytic therapy. Grafts in 12 of these patients remained patent without additional intervention, and in one graft thrombus formed again. In contrast, among four patients without angiographic evidence of improvement, thrombus formed again in four grafts (p less than 0.004). Intraoperative lytic therapy was considered successful in 74% of instances (17/23), including four of seven patients with hypercoagulable states. Three of six patients whose grafts failed had major amputations, whereas there were no amputations after successful infusions. Twelve patients were heparinized after intraoperative lytic therapy. Ten patients in this group were considered treatment successes, and two were considered treatment failures. Three of 11 patients not heparinized after intraoperative lytic therapy were considered treatment failures. Four hematomas occurred in the former group and none in the latter (p less than 0.03). No hematomas occurred in the heparin-induced thrombosis group in spite of anticoagulation with sodium warfarin (Coumadin). Only one hematoma occurred within 6 hours of intraoperative lytic therapy, and thus it was attributable to the infusion. We conclude that intraoperative lytic therapy is an effective adjunct to manage residual thrombus or persistent ischemia or both after lower extremity revascularization. Postinfusion angiography is of prognostic value. Heparinization after intraoperative lytic therapy seems beneficial but significantly increases the risk of bleeding complications.\r"

Lowering blood cholesterol retards coronary atherosclerosis and similar treatment might limit peripheral atherosclerosis. To identify lipid risk factors for peripheral atherosclerosis, 144 patients with peripheral atherosclerosis (98 with severe disease and 46 with stable claudication) and 61 age-matched control subjects were studied. Fasting lipid (cholesterol and triglycerides) and lipoprotein (high-density lipoprotein [HDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], and very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL] cholesterol [C]) levels were measured. The incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, amount of previous tobacco use, and location and severity of the peripheral atherosclerosis were also determined. Patients with peripheral atherosclerosis had higher VLDL-C and lower HDL-C levels than controls had, but serum cholesterol and plasma LDL-C levels were similar. Patients with peripheral atherosclerosis also had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Predictors of peripheral atherosclerosis by regression analysis were diabetes mellitus, low HDL-C levels, and tobacco use, with diabetes mellitus being the strongest variable. Peripheral atherosclerosis below the inguinal ligament was strongly predicted by low HDL-C and increased VLDL-C levels but not by increased cholesterol or LDL-C levels. Thus lipid risk factors for peripheral atherosclerosis are different, and attempts at limiting late graft failure by lowering lipid levels should be directed toward these lipoproteins.\r"

  ".U": "90012445\r", 
  ".W": "Over a period of 18 years, 191 consecutive patients had interruption of the inferior vena cava with the Hunter-Sessions balloon for complications of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Causes of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism included the postoperative state (33%), cancer (32%), and stroke (11%). There were 93 females and 98 males; ages ranged from 17 to 90 years (average, 57 years). Indications for placement of the Hunter-Sessions balloon were as follows: contraindication to anticoagulants (33%), anticoagulant complications (24%), pulmonary embolism despite anticoagulants (45%), and others including inferior vena cava thrombus (12%). Sixty-eight percent had clinical phlebitis and 36% had positive venography results. Pulmonary embolism had occurred in 165 patients (86%). It was diagnosed by ventilation-perfusion scanning (75%), angiography (23%), or on clinical grounds (2%) in patients with confirmed deep venous thrombosis. At the time of the procedure 52% were in significant cardiopulmonary distress, and 10% were intubated and on respirators. Transjugular placement was done in 188 patients, and transfemoral placement was performed in three. All All tolerated inferior vena cava interruption. Thirty patients (15%) died while in the hospital an average of 21 days after balloon placement, which was unrelated to the deaths. Follow-up was 45 months. Ninety-four patients are dead, 95 are alive, and the status of two patients is unknown. Twenty-nine of 64 patients (45%) who died after they left the hospital died of cancer. At last follow-up, 75% of patients had legs free of edema and 25% had need for elastic stockings. No malfunction or migration has occurred with the device. No patient had a pulmonary embolism while in the hospital after insertion of the Hunter-Sessions balloon, and no patient died of pulmonary embolism. Late minor pulmonary embolism occurred in three patients.\r"

We have used a unique resource--a continuous population-based registry of cases of squamous cell skin cancer within a single prepaid health plan-to describe basic epidemiologic features of this malignancy and compare it with the more widely studied melanoma. Both malignancies are considerably more common in this population than we expected based on previous reports from the general population. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the incidence of squamous cell skin cancer increased 2.6 times in men and 3.1 times in women, while incidence of melanoma rose 3.5-fold and 4.6-fold in men and women, respectively. Skin cancers of both types involving the head and neck or the extremities increased essentially in parallel over these 27 years. Melanomas of the trunk, however, appeared to increase at a faster rate in both sexes. These observations are consistent with the impression that the rising incidence of both malignancies may be attributable to increased voluntary exposure to the sun over an extended period.\r"

The Council first reviews socioeconomic data pertinent to general internal medicine. This is followed by a review of key issues pertinent to internists that relate to such topics as graduate medical education, reimbursement, scope of practice, manpower, and competition. In the conclusions, the Council suggests activities for the medical profession to pursue in response to the identified environmental trends.\r"

  ".W": "As a result of federal legislation passed in April 1987, New Mexico was the first state to resume a 65-mph speed limit on rural Interstate highways. We compared the rates of fatal crashes before and after the speed limit change. The rate of fatal crashes in the 1 year after the speed limit was increased was 2.9 per 100 million vehicle-miles traveled, compared with a predicted rate of 1.5 per 100 million vehicle-miles based on the trend of the 5 previous years. When fatal crashes that occurred after the speed limit change were compared with fatal crashes in the 5 previous years, there was no difference in the mean age and sex of the at-fault drivers, mean age and sex of the victims, seat belt use by the victims, or alcohol involvement of the crashes. The increase in fatal crashes can be attributed to an increase in fatal single-vehicle crashes. Vehicles on rural Interstates are traveling at greater rates of speed and a larger proportion of vehicles are exceeding the 65-mph speed limit. The benefits associated with the 65-mph speed limit should be weighed against the increased loss of lives.\r"

From national death certificate data for the years 1979 through 1985, we made dot maps of fatalities due to excessive heat (International Classification of Diseases code E900) among persons 65 years or older. The maps show clusterings of deaths, particularly in the central, south central, and southeastern sections of the United States, to an extent not fully explained by the population density or temperature extremes. The counties principally affected were highly urbanized and, for races other than white, were relatively poor. Our maps identify counties in which heat-related health problems in the elderly are particularly severe. Public health officials in high-risk areas should undertake heat-wave contingency planning and physicians practicing in such areas should familiarize themselves with the treatment of the spectrum of heat-related illnesses.\r"

Helmet use increased from 5.5% before the campaign to 15.7% afterward in Seattle and from 1.0% to 2.9% in Portland. Strong associations were found between helmet use and white compared with black or other race; riding geared vs nongeared bicycles; riding at playgrounds, in parks, or on bicycle paths vs on city streets; and riding with adults or other children compared with riding alone. The proportions of helmet wearers, adjusted for these variables, increased from 4.6% to 14.0% in Seattle and from 1.0% to 3.6% in Portland, a significantly greater increase in use in Seattle compared with Portland. We conclude that a community-wide bicycle helmet campaign can increase helmet use among children.\r"

Information about cause of injury, which is available for fatal injuries, is rarely available for severe nonfatal injuries.

E-coded hospital discharge data systems are potentially one of the most effective and feasible means available to collect data needed to prevent and control injuries. We recommend that E codes be required elements in hospital discharge data systems, that separate fields for E codes be created, and that E-code definitions and guidelines be developed.\r"

In practice, however, there is a tendency to underestimate the resources needed to initiate and maintain a registry. Herein, we describe the purposes, resource requirements, and limitations of trauma registries.

Physical fitness was measured by a maximal treadmill exercise test. Average follow-up was slightly more than 8 years, for a total of 110,482 person-years of observation. There were 240 deaths in men and 43 deaths in women. Age-adjusted all-cause mortality rates declined across physical fitness quintiles from 64.0 per 10,000 person-years in the least-fit men to 18.6 per 10,000 person-years in the most-fit men (slope, -4.5). Corresponding values for women were 39.5 per 10,000 person-years to 8.5 per 10,000 person-years (slope, -5.5). These trends remained after statistical adjustment for age, smoking habit, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose level, parental history of coronary heart disease, and follow-up interval. Lower mortality rates in higher fitness categories also were seen for cardiovascular disease and cancer of combined sites. Attributable risk estimates for all-cause mortality indicated that low physical fitness was an important risk factor in both men and women. Higher levels of physical fitness appear to delay all-cause mortality primarily due to lowered rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine trends in the medical knowledge of internal medicine residents during the past 6 years. Comparison of performance on the items common to pairs of the certifying examinations of the American Board of Internal Medicine from 1983 to 1988 revealed that the scores of candidates in the reference group have declined, but not dramatically. This trend has occurred among candidates from the top residency programs as well as all other residency programs, and it is present in candidates of all levels of overall clinical competence. Continuing declines in this area could ultimately affect patient care.\r"

The purpose of this exploratory study was to assess the existence and nature of hospital policy regarding these documents. A survey questionnaire was sent to 394 randomly selected hospitals in the United States. Of the 219 responding hospitals, 146 (67%) reported having a formal policy regarding advance directives. The large majority of those with a policy require the patient to notify the hospital of an advance directive, while only 4% of the respondents actively inquire about these documents. Hospitals in states with legislation that sanctions advance directives were significantly more likely to have a formal policy regarding these documents than hospitals in states without such legislation. Forty-six percent of the respondents reported having an ethics committee; however, the presence of an ethics committee was not significantly associated with the presence of a formal policy. Of the 69 hospitals that had both a formal policy and an ethics committee, only 30 (43%) reported that the policy had been reviewed by the ethics committee. Ethical and legal issues regarding hospital policy on advance directives are discussed. Hospitals should adopt formal policies to ask all adult patients at the time of admission whether they have prepared a living will, durable power of attorney, or similar document; and ethics committees should play a more active role in policy development.\r"

Physicians in Arkansas who were identified to be currently engaged in general practice, family medicine, or internal medicine, including its subspecialities (N = 1293), were surveyed to assess attitudes toward and experiences with advance directives. Almost 80% of all respondents expressed a positive attitude and fewer than 2% expressed a negative attitude toward such documents. A majority (55.9%) had actual experience with the instruments in their practices, and 83.5% of these physicians said that their attitude had become more positive as a result of their experience. More frequent employment of advance directives in critical situations was associated with more positive attitudes and experiences. Most of the benefits claimed for advance directives--improved communication and trust, easier and more confident treatment decision, less stress and guilt, and promotion of patient autonomy--were substantiated by the results.\r"

Ordering patterns and clinical indications for the PT and APTT tests on the medical service at a teaching hospital were studied. Eighty-one percent of all patients admitted to the medical service had a PT and APTT test ordered. When compared with a modified version of guidelines for the use of the PT and APTT tests recently developed by the Medical Necessity Project of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Associations of America and endorsed by the American College of Physicians, at least 70% of these tests were not clinically indicated. Many of the unindicated tests were ordered prior to invasive procedures or, apparently, out of habit. These inappropriate PT and APTT tests cost at least $60,948 per year for the medical service. Based on these findings, we suggest methods of reducing the inappropriate use of the PT and APTT tests.\r"

Among perfusate constituents analyzed were urea, total amino acids, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malonaldehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), allantoin, potassium, phosphate, and glucose. After perfusion, livers were homogenized and analyzed for xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, GSH content, and lysosomal lability. Perfusate AST, LDH, NAG, potassium, glucose, and phosphate increased significantly with time, and there were significant differences in the final values between 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C, 42.5 degrees C and 43 degrees C (P less than .05). GSH levels increased significantly at all temperatures after 90 and 120 min, whereas GSSG levels differed significantly at 60, 90, and 120 min for 37 degrees C vs. 42 degrees C, 42.5 degrees C, and 43 degrees C (P less than .05). Mean MDA levels at 37 degrees C differed from those at 41 degrees C and 43 degrees C (P less than .05) at each temperature. Allantoin levels increased significantly with time of perfusion; mean levels at 37 degrees C were significantly different from mean levels at each temperature at 60, 90, and 120 min. GSH liver tissue levels decreased with perfusion at hyperthermic temperatures; mean values at 41 degrees C, 42 degrees C, and 42.5 degrees C, and 43 degrees C differed from 37 degrees C mean values (P less than .01). Type O XO increased after 120 min perfusion from 6.4% +/- 2.0% at 37 degrees C to 55% +/- 30%, 43% +/- 27%, and 63% +/- 29% at 42 degrees C, 42.5 degrees C, and 43 degrees C, respectively. Lysosomal lability increased after perfusion at 42.5 degrees C. There was a significant increase in nonsedimentable NAG activity at 42.5 degrees C (P less than .05). These data support the premise that hyperthermic toxicity to the liver may be a consequence of oxidative stress brought about by enhanced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption and conversion of XO to type O. Such conversion results in superoxide formation and subsequent depletion of cellular GSH, labilization of the lysosomes, and plasma membrane damage.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis was undertaken of the association between blood transfusion and long-term results for 218 patients with stage III gastric cancer who were curatively treated by partial gastrectomy. One hundred and fifty-two patients received blood transfusion within the perioperative period. The postoperative 5-year survival rates were 49.3% for the transfused patients and 62.1% for the non-transfused patients (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, the postoperative survival of patients who had been transfused preoperatively was significantly lower than that of the non-transfused patients. The preoperatively transfused group of patients were found to have tumors that were larger than those of the non-transfused group. On the basis of the above data, it appears that the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer is poorer when such patients receive preoperative blood transfusion than when patients do not receive transfusions, and that this adverse effect in the transfused patients is probably attributable to the larger size of their tumors, even though the stage of advancement of gastric cancer is the same in both groups of patients.\r"

In the literature, diagnosis based on intraoperative pancreatic biopsy is a matter of controversy. Our study comprised 70 patients with a suspected space occupying pancreatic process who were operated on with the primary goal of arriving at a speedy and precise diagnosis, according to which the appropriate surgery for the specific patient would be performed. Frozen section showed that 44 patients had malignancy of the pancreas; in three patients, there was a false-negative result. In four patients, the histological picture was consistent with chronic pancreatitis. In the remaining 19 patients, biopsy was not performed and the diagnosis was made on the basis of intraoperative inspection and palpation of pancreas. On reviewing the patients, we found that the surgical risk involved in biopsy is quite low and that a high price was paid for diagnosis by inspection and palpation alone. The risk vs. benefit aspect of intraoperative pancreatic biopsy is discussed.\r"

In contrast to our previous randomized trial of patients with FIGO stage IIIB carcinoma of the uterine cervix who were documented to be without paraaortic lymph node metastasis by pretherapy staging paraaortic lymphadenectomy [Piver et al.: J Surg Oncol 35: 129-134, 1987], these patients either refused surgical staging or, because of medical conditions, could not undergo pretherapy paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Patients were to receive 6,000 cGy/6 weeks to the pelvis by megavoltage radiation therapy followed by 2,500 cGy to point A by intracavitary and vaginal radium/cesium. The median pelvic cGy for the Hu patients was 5,967 cGy and for the placebo patients 6,013 cGy. Leukopenia (WBC less than 2,500/mm3) significantly increased in patients given hydroxyurea as compared with those given placebo (P less than 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference relative to anemia, thrombocytopenia, radiation skin reactions, diarrhea, or radiation induced complications requiring surgical correction. The estimated 5 year disease-free interval was 54% for the hydroxyurea patients (median not reached) and 18% for the placebo patients with a median of 11 months. Because of these results, those of our previous reports, and those of the Gynecologic Oncology Group, we believe that hydroxyruea plus pelvic radiation should be the standard against which new potential radiation sensitizers are tested.\r"

Cox's regression analysis of age, receptor value, stage, nodal involvement, race, menopausal status, treatment, and study period in the evaluation of disease-free survival and overall survival confirmed stage and lymph node status as prognostic factors. Estrogen receptor status, menopausal status, age at presentation, treatment, study period, and race did not enter the regression, except in stage I, where race was a variable.

The majority of squamous cell carcinomas reported so far have had some degree of co-existing adenocarcinoma, while the cases presented in this report had no glandular component at all. The histogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma is not clear, but at present, it is believed that most cases arise from the follicular epithelium. In our cases, in spite of an intensive examination of serially sectioned specimens, no areas of adenocarcinoma, squamous metaplasia from the follicular epithelium, or congenital squamous remnants could be found.\r"

  ".W": "The development of pre-neoplastic and neoplastic changes has been documented in the urinary tract of the rat after portacaval shunting (PCS) and has been attributed variously to circulating carcinogens, the development of bladder stones, or deficiency of vitamin A. Therefore, an investigation of the pathogenesis of bladder tumors after PCS was undertaken in 120 PCS and 120 sham-operated male Sprague Dawley rats. Ten rats from each group were sacrificed at monthly intervals for 1 year after surgery. The incidence of calculus formation in the bladder increased from 20% at 2 months to 80% at 12 months after PCS. Hyperplastic mucosal changes occurred 3 months after surgery. After 5 months, distinct papillomas developed, and after 7 months, increasingly severe papillary changes and squamous metaplasia were evident. Interestingly, these urothelial changes were seen both in animals with and without bladder stones. Significantly decreased serum vitamin A levels were observed at 6 months (54.0 +/- 8.8 IU/dl, n = 10) (P less than .01), and 12 months (41.0 +/- 7.9 IU/dl, n = 10) (P less than .01), compared to those in sham-operated controls of 126.0 +/- 12.5 IU/dl (n = 10) and 122.7 +/- 19.2 IU/dl (n = 10). In addition, PCS resulted in a significantly increased activity of urothelial ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a marker of neoplastic changes, at 6 months (3.1 +/- 0.4 nmoles CO2 in 60 min/mg protein, n = 5) (P less than .05) and 12 months (8.1 +/- 0.6 nmoles CO2 in 60 min/mg protein, n = 5) (P less than .05), when compared to ODC activity in controls (0.9 +/- 0.2 nmoles CO2 in 60 min/mg protein, n = 5). These data suggest that the development of urinary bladder tumor after PCS in the rat may be due to vitamin A deficiency rather than to bladder calculi or urinary carcinogens.\r"

As many of the salivary gland malignancies we see are of the recurrent type, the following study was done to determine the efficacy of a vigorous attempt at retreatment. During the period January 1, 1960, through December 31, 1984, 352 patients with major and minor salivary gland tumors were evaluated at our institution. There were 149 benign lesions and 203 patients with malignant tumors. Of these, 99 patients had recurrent and metastatic tumors that had been treated initially elsewhere. Thirty-three of these patients were able to be treated with curative intent: surgery, 21; surgery plus radiation, 9; radiation therapy alone, 2; and radiation plus chemotherapy, 1. The 5 year survival with no evidence of disease was achieved in three patients with surgery alone and two patients with surgery plus radiation therapy. The group of five patients was comprised of two patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas of the parotid, one with intermediate grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid, one, sebaceous cell carcinoma of the parotid, and one, adenoid cystic carcinoma of an accessory salivary gland. The results of this study serve to re-emphasize the relative poor yield of attempts at retreatment of loco-regional recurrence of salivary gland tumors.\r"

In our series of 94 such patients, 6 developed late relapse of their disease. The subsequent survival of these patients did not relate to any of the primary tumors' characteristics, but to the pattern of the late recurrence. Four patients with visceral metastases were dead within 1 to 5 years following relapse, one patient with lymph node involvement is alive with metastases, and another patient with skin metastases has no signs of disease following surgery and immunotherapy. Our conclusion is that malignant melanoma patients should be placed under close follow-up for the rest of their lives.\r"

The findings were compared with those in livers of rats fed a commercial diet. The cell viability was determined using the succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (SDI) test. The succinate dehydrogenase (SD) activity of liver cells, when exposed to heat (43 degrees C) for 2, 5, or 10 hr, decreased in a time-dependent manner, in each tissue. The decrease in SD activity was evident in 3'-Me-DAB liver for 5 hr of heat treatment on day 57, compared with findings in the normal liver. Significant differences were present for 2, 5, and 10 hr on days 93 and 136. Thus a chemically induced hepatoma is more sensitive to heat than are the normal cells. As this thermosensitivity gradually increased during the hepatocarcinogenesis, the malignant cells are particularly vulnerable to hyperthermia.\r"

  ".W": "The controversy surrounding the choice of a prosthesis for valve replacement in the elderly patient prompted me to review the performance of mechanical (Medtronic Hall [Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.] and St. Jude Medical [St. Jude Medical, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.]) valves implanted in 213 patients 65 years and older (mean 70.4 years) from 1980 to 1985. There were 63 mitral, 131 aortic, and 19 double (aortic and mitral) valve replacements. Most patients undergoing aortic valve replacement had stenotic lesions, but half of the patients in the mitral valve replacement group had regurgitation with or without stenosis. Early mortality rates for mitral, aortic, and double valve replacement were 4.8%, 6.1%, and 21.1%, respectively (p less than 0.01). The mortality rate for patients 65 to 74 years old was 6.5% and that for those older than 75 years was 9.1%. The cumulative follow-up for the survivors was 850 patient-years. The late mortality rate was 8.1% per patient-year but was valve-related in only 1.3% per patient-year. Noncardiac causes accounted for 43.5% of the late deaths. The late mortality rate was significantly higher in patients who had regurgitant lesions than in those who had stenotic or mixed disease. It was also higher in the older patients (10.3% per patient-year) than in the younger group (7.6% per patient-year; p less than 0.05). Reoperation was required in only six patients (0.7% per patient-year). Thrombotic obstruction of the prosthesis and systemic thromboembolism occurred at linearized rates of 0.6% per patient-year and 2.5% per patient year, respectively, and significant anticoagulant-related hemorrhage at a rate of 0.6% per patient-year. With the exception of late mortality, the incidence of all late complications was similar to that of patients younger than 65 years operated on during the same period. Actuarially, global survival (58% +/- 4%) and freedom from reoperation (95% +/- 2%), from thrombotic obstruction (96% +/- 1%), from thromboembolism (92% +/- 2%), from all valve-related mortality and morbidity (82% +/- 3%), and from valve failure (93% +/- 2%) were also similar to those of the younger patients. Mechanical prostheses perform well in elderly patients. I could not confirm an increase in thromboembolic or hemorrhagic episodes, and the respective mortality and morbidity indexes were similar to those observed in younger patients.\r"

  ".U": "90013331\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred fifty-nine consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting were studied to determine clinical and laboratory predictors of excessive postoperative packed red blood cell transfusion. Consideration of the distribution of packed red blood cells administered revealed that the patients could be divided into two groups: those patients who received 5 units of red blood cells or less (group I, n = 139) and those patients who received more than 5 units of packed red blood cells (group II, n = 20). The Mann-Whitney test or Fisher's exact test was used whenever appropriate to test differences between these two groups with respect to twelve patient variables. Patients in group II were found to have a significantly longer preoperative template bleeding time and decreased preoperative packed red blood cell volume (p less than 0.0008 for both variables). In addition, group II patients were significantly older (p = 0.026), were more likely to have had preoperative heparin therapy (p = 0.049), and contained a greater proportion of women (p = 0.0048). Of interest, variables that did not achieve statistical significance between groups were partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, platelet count, preoperative hematocrit level, urgency of operation, recent ingestion of aspirin, and recent heparin administration. All of the measured variables were used in a stepwise logistic regression analysis to identify the best predictors of the need for more than 5 units of packed red blood cells after operation. Of the variables examined, bleeding time (p less than 0.001; chi 2 improvement = 15.1) and red blood cell volume (p = 0.009; chi 2 improvement = 6.8) were the best predictors of excessive postoperative packed red blood cell use. On the basis of a 50% logistic probability level, the specificity and sensitivity of these two variables in predicting greater than a 5-unit transfusion requirement were 85% and 99%, respectively. A clinically useful nomogram based on this logistic model is presented. This nomogram suggests that a ratio of bleeding time to red blood cell volume of 0.0071 or greater is associated with a greater than 70% chance of requiring more than 5 units of packed red blood cells. We conclude that preoperative bleeding time and red blood cell volume are useful predictors of excessive postoperative blood transfusion. These results suggest that factors other than aspirin therapy may be associated with bleeding time prolongation leading to excessive postoperative transfusion.\r"

This intraoperative study was undertaken to determine whether bypass grafting improves regional wall motion in areas of preoperative ischemic dysfunction. In 17 patients undergoing coronary bypass, short-axis echocardiograms were obtained with the chest open 30 minutes before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Regional wall motion was calculated quantitatively as the percent increase in segmental wall thickness during systole, with 40% thickening or less defined as indicating ischemic dysfunction. Qualitatively, it was evaluated by visual changes in endocardial wall motion according to a graded score (0 = normal to 4 = dyskinesia). Of the 136 segments studied, 44 (32%) had evidence of ischemic dysfunction before coronary bypass. When regional wall motion was analyzed in all 136 segments after coronary bypass, there was no significant change in either quantitative indices (62% +/- 7% before grafting versus 58% +/- 6% after grafting) or qualitative indices (0.19 +/- 0.06 versus 0.17 +/- 0.06). However, in those segments with ischemic dysfunction before grafting, there was a significant increase in quantitative indices of regional wall motion after grafting (24% +/- 2% versus 50% +/- 5%; p less than 0.02). By contrast, qualitative indices continued to show no significant improvement (1.3 +/- 0.1 versus 1.05 +/- 0.2). We conclude that coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improves areas of ischemic regional wall dysfunction. These changes can be difficult to detect with visual qualitative methods and are best analyzed by techniques assessing changes in segmental wall thickness.\r"

Recovery of these responses, except to the anticholinesterase agent, suggests that reinervation occurs in autotransplanted organs in primates. The Hering-Breuer reflex was present at 1.9 and 2.2 months after the operation in two animals subjected to autotransplantation. These cardiopulmonary reflex responses were also demonstrated in two allograft recipients studied at 15 and 16.9 months after the operation. Return of protective reflexes such as coughing may be an important mechanism to prevent aspiration pneumonitis and other complications in humans.\r"

This study assessed the standard technique for donor myocardial preservation using hearts from seven mongrel dogs (mean weight 192.7 gm), which were arrested, excised, and placed in a cooler containing saline and ice. Temperature probes placed in both the left and right ventricular free walls and the septum revealed that, after cardioplegia, temperatures fell to 10.3 degrees, 7.5 degrees, and 7.6 degrees C, respectively. Temperature decreased to below 1 degree C after 75, 75, and 60 minutes for the left ventricle, right ventricle, and septum, respectively, independent of the size of the heart (range = 104 to 322 gm). After 4 hours of cooling, temperature was below 0 degrees C throughout the myocardium. Examination with an electron microscope showed similar serial changes over 4 hours in all hearts, including moderate-to-severe cytoplasmic and nuclear swelling and mitochondrial calcium deposits. Cell membranes remained intact, which suggests that the damage was not irreversible. We conclude that current donor heart preservation techniques may result in unacceptably low myocardial temperatures that cause reversible myocardial injury.\r"

Proximal airway clearance was measured by observing the movement of carbon particles through a bronchoscope. Preoperative and postoperative clearance rates for the right lungs in these dogs were unchanged. Although preoperative clearance rates in the transplanted left lungs were comparable with those of the right lungs, these left lungs were unable to clear the carbon particles during a 15-minute observation period 3 weeks postoperatively. In contrast, preoperative and postoperative clearance rates for the dogs that underwent sleeve resection were unchanged for both lungs. Mucus rigidity was studied by microrheometry and was found to be significantly increased postoperatively for samples collected from the autotransplanted and allotransplanted lungs than for samples collected from the untreated right lungs. These changes in mucus were noted for forces representing both normal ciliary beat and coughing. Viscoelastic properties of mucus were not significantly altered after sleeve lobectomy. Microscopic study showed squamous cell metaplasia and relative disappearance of bronchial glands distal to the anastomosis in all transplanted lungs. These changes were less pronounced in the sleeve resected bronchi. We conclude that changes in rheologic characteristics of mucus can impair mucociliary clearance and may be related to denervation after lung transplantation. Bronchial devascularization may have an additional effect of altering mucosal structures and function in the early postoperative period after lung transplantation. These effects are avoided by preserving peribronchial tissue in sleeve resection.\r"

Current techniques of lung preservation allow a maximum of 4 to 6 hours of safe ischemic time. The function of canine left lung allografts stored for 12 hours after being cooled by pulmonary artery flush was studied. Two types of flush solution were used: group I; Euro-Collins solution; group II, low-potassium-dextran solution. Lung function was studied immediately and 3 days after transplantation. This protocol enables study of acute preservation-related lung injury and the delayed manifestations of ischemic and reperfusion injury after a 3-day period of recovery. Inflatable cuffs were placed around each pulmonary artery at operation and were attached to subcutaneous injection ports. Temporarily occluding either pulmonary artery allowed independent study of the native or transplanted lung. Using this model, we were able to demonstrate reliable and reproducible preservation of lungs for 12 hours. The low-potassium-dextran solution provided significantly better immediate function of the preserved lung than the Euro-Collins solution: arterial oxygen tension 509 +/- 15 mm Hg versus 111 +/- 16 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). Function on the third day was excellent for both groups. Pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and carbon dioxide tension were not significantly different between the groups immediately or on day 3.\r"

  ".W": "Lung cancer is the most common malignant disease in the United States. Only the few tumors detected very early are curable, but there has been some progress in the management of more advanced non-small cell lung cancer, particularly in regionally inoperable disease. Prevention of central nervous system relapse is an important issue in this group of patients because brain metastases ultimately develop in 20% to 25% of them. Seventy-three patients with regionally advanced non-small cell lung cancer were entered into a Phase II trial of neutron chest radiotherapy sandwiched between four cycles of chemotherapy including cisplatin, vinblastine, and mitomycin C. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was administered concurrently with chest radiotherapy (3000 cGy in 10 fractions in 15 patients; 3600 cGy in 18 fractions in the remaining 50 patients). Patients underwent computed tomographic scan of the brain before treatment and every 3 months after treatment. The initial overall response rate was 79%, but 65 of the 73 patients have subsequently died of recurrent disease. Median follow-up is 9 months for all 73 patients and 26 months for eight long-term survivors. No patient who completed the prophylactic cranial irradiation program had clinical or radiologic brain metastases. Toxic reactions to prophylactic cranial irradiation included reversible alopecia in all patients, progressive dementia in one patient, and possible optic neuritis in one patient. Both of these patients received 300 cGy per fraction of irradiation. The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation has been controversial, but its safety and efficacy in this trial supports its application in a group of patients at high risk for central nervous system relapse. Further evaluation of prophylactic cranial irradiation in clinical trials for regionally advanced non-small cell lung cancer is warranted.\r"

Patients with asymptomatic spontaneous pneumothorax can be safely observed. Patients with symptomatic pneumothorax should initially undergo tube thoracostomy. If an air leak persists, thoracotomy, stapling of blebs, and pleurodesis can be safely performed. Because of the prevalence of bilateral disease, a median sternotomy incision is recommended. Two patients underwent surgical treatment. Diffuse bullous disease associated with infiltration of lung parenchyma by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was identified in both. Both patients survived and were discharged. Patients whose pneumothorax developed while they were undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure induced by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia had a 92.3% mortality rate. In all patients surviving for longer than 7 days after development of the initial pneumothorax, a contralateral pneumothorax later developed. Severe concurrent disease made the patients poor operative candidates. However, in the absence of concurrent illness, if a persistent large air leak is believed to contribute significantly to respiratory failure, surgical intervention may be indicated.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test the effect of glucose and a formulation enriched with branched chain amino acids as additives to oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution in the ischemic heart. Energy-depleted isolated working rat hearts were subjected to 68 minutes of normothermic global ischemia during which oxygenated cardioplegic solution was used to protect them. The hearts were then reperfused in the nonworking mode for 10 minutes and for a further 30 minutes in the working mode. The hearts were randomly divided into three groups, in which various oxygenated cardioplegic solutions were perfused. Group 1 (control) was subjected to modified St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution and groups 2 and 3 to the same solution with the addition of glucose (11.1 mmol/L) and glucose (11.1 mmol/L) and branched chain amino acids, respectively. Recovery of aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac output, aortic pressure, adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, and oxygen consumption was significantly better in group 2 than in group 1. In addition, recovery of aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac output, aortic pressure, stroke volume, minute work, adenosine triphosphate, and creatine phosphate was found to be significantly enhanced in group 3. Release of adenine catabolites and lactic dehydrogenase from these hearts during postischemic reperfusion was significantly decreased. Thus, during global ischemia in the energy-depleted heart, the presence of glucose and branched chain amino acids in oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution enhanced myocardial protection.\r"

  ".W": "Of 21 dogs undergoing ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 50% stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery, 15 developed intractable ventricular fibrillation and underwent 1 added hour of femoro-femoral bypass. Three hearts were removed after 1 hour on bypass without myocardial reperfusion for biochemical and mitochondrial analysis. After the 1 hour, five underwent unmodified blood reperfusion on bypass; seven underwent 1 hour of aortic clamping on vented bypass to simulate coronary artery bypass grafting with multidose blood cardioplegic reperfusion. Regional systolic shortening was measured with ultrasonic crystals and cardiac output was measured by thermodilution techniques. All six hearts with no ventricular fibrillation or with reversible ventricular fibrillation and hearts that were not reperfused developed cardiogenic shock (40% decrease in stroke work index, p less than 0.05) because of persistent left ventricular dyskinesia (-40% of systolic shortening, p less than 0.05) and progressive circumflex hypocontractility (48% systolic shortening, p less than 0.05) and showed extensive (68%) triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining. Two dogs died of left ventricular power failure (33% mortality rate). In contrast, 11 of 12 dogs that were reperfused could be weaned from bypass (8% mortality rate). The four dogs surviving after unmodified blood reperfusion (20% mortality rate) showed severe residual left ventricular dysfunction (39% of control stroke work index, p less than 0.05), had equivocal recovery of anterior contractility (10% +/- 7% of systolic shortening), had marginal recovery of contractility in the remote myocardium (60% +/- 11% of systolic shortening), and had extensive triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining (58%). Conversely, all seven dogs with intractable ventricular fibrillation undergoing controlled reperfusion after 4 hours of ischemia recovered normal stroke work index (91%), regained 23% of systolic shortening in the region supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery (p less than 0.05), 125% of systolic shortening in the circumflex region (p less than 0.05), and showed only 25% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining (p less than 0.05). These results suggest aggressive treatment of intractable ventricular fibrillation after acute myocardial infarction by providing reperfusion on bypass can salvage hearts thought previously to be damaged irreversibly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Mononuclear cells obtained from 10 patients with cholecystectomy were examined as control samples. Cultures for phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 production were incubated in microtiter plates for 24 hours with cells labeled with tritium thymidine used as target cells. Lymphocyte subsets were measured by using monoclonal antibodies. The results obtained with preoperative blood samples were compared with those from the first, third, and seventh days after operation. In patients having cardiac operations, mitogen responsiveness was low on both the first and the seventh days after operation and interleukin-2 production was markedly depressed (greater than 90% depressed) on the first postoperative day. However, in control samples from patients having cholecystectomy, lymphocyte subsets, mitogen responsiveness, and interleukin-2 production showed no significant changes. Improvement in interleukin-2 production occurred immediately in patients without blood transfusion from random donors and reached normal levels by postoperative day 3. However, interleukin-2 production remained depressed on day 3 in all patients with transfusion from random donors and remained significantly diminished even on day 7 in such patients in New York Heart Association classes III and IV. We conclude that heart operations for which cardiopulmonary bypass is used are associated with depression of cellular immunity, including interleukin-2 production. Furthermore, it appears that both blood transfusion from random donors and the general preoperative condition of the patients contribute to suppression of measures of cell-mediated immunity.\r"

  ".W": "Afterload independent, inotropic state sensitive indices of regional function were sought in 31 canine hearts instrumented with piezoelectric crystals to depict trapezoidal areas in the left anterior descending and circumflex arterial beds. Control and postinterventional end-systolic pressure versus regional length and area relationships and regional stroke work versus end-diastolic length and area relationships were inscribed during incremental volume loading on right heart bypass. Hearts were randomized to undergo afterload variation with phenylephrine infusion, contractility augmentation by calcium chloride, or 20 minutes of ischemia in the region of the left anterior descending artery with 30 minutes of reperfusion. All relationships were linear before and after each intervention (mean r = 0.726 to 0.974). The slopes of each correlation were interpreted to quantify intrinsic regional contractility, and all were afterload insensitive (unaffected by phenylephrine). Regional stroke work versus end-diastolic area and length relationships were depressed 55% and 62%, respectively, after ischemia (p less than 0.001 each), whereas neither end-systolic pressure versus regional area nor regional length was significantly altered. Calcium chloride increased regional stroke work versus area 45% in both arterial beds, but significantly increased the other indices only in the left anterior descending and not the left circumflex region. Unlike previous studies of global contractility, correlation of end-systolic events alone did not reliably discriminate perturbations in regional function. The superiority of regional stroke work versus end-diastolic area may be due to incorporating pressure-area changes during the entire cardiac cycle and obviating variability owing to crystal orientation inexactly parallel to fiber shortening.\r"

  ".U": "90013346\r", 
  ".W": "Between June 1984 and September 1987, 48 patients underwent Lecompte's modification of the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries, including transposition with intact ventricular septum with preparatory pulmonary artery banding (n = 18), with patent ductus arteriosus (n = 11), with dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (n = 4), and transposition with ventricular septal defect (n = 15). Ages ranged from 12 days to 36 months (mean 8 months) and weights ranged from 2.7 to 12.8 kg (mean 5.7 kg). Two deaths occurred, yielding an operative mortality rate of 4.2%. Preparatory pulmonary artery banding resulted in an increase to 65 +/- 5 mm Hg in the left ventricular afterload. Linear regression of the optimum circumference of the band (Y, millimeters) against left ventricular end-diastolic volume (X, milliliters) yielded the following formula: Y = 0.23X + 19.7 (r = 0.885, p less than 0.001). Influence of left ventricular mass on cardiac function after anatomic correction was evaluated. The total amount of dopamine used after repair in patients in whom the left ventricular mass was less than 60% of normal was significantly larger than that in patients with a left ventricular mass greater than or equal to 60% of normal (p less than 0.002). The left ventricular end-diastolic volume in patients with a left ventricular mass less than 60% of normal increased significantly 2 months after operation (p less than 0.05), whereas it decreased in patients with a left ventricular mass greater than 60% of normal (p less than 0.01). We believe it is safe to perform this procedure in patients in whom the left ventricular mass is larger than 60% of normal. Most newborn infants with simple transposition can undergo correction between 10 and 20 days of life if the ductus arteriosus is kept patent with prostaglandin E1 and the left ventricle is thereby loaded. Preparatory pulmonary artery banding, when necessary, will be satisfactory if the left ventricular pressure is greater than 65 mm Hg and/or the left ventricular/right ventricular pressure ratio is greater than 0.8.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1963 and 1986, 195 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus were seen in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Southern California School of Medicine. Of these 195 patients, 137 had unresectable or inoperable tumors and received radiotherapy. A combination of radiotherapy and surgical therapy was used in 46 patients, 9 patients were treated with surgery alone, and three with chemotherapy alone. Among the nonsurgical patients, 13 scored less than 50 on the Karnofsky scale, 25 had distant metastases, and 69 lost more than 10% of their body weight. The majority (94%) had squamous cell carcinoma and a few (6%) had adenocarcinoma. Fifty percent had middle esophageal lesions, 30% had lower lesions, and 20% had upper esophageal lesions. Stage I was diagnosed in 13%, II in 27%, III in 29%, and IV in 27%; the disease was not staged in 5%. The 5-year actuarial survival rate for all patients was 4% (median 32 weeks). The 5-year survival rate of the 46 patients with combination therapy was 18%, and it was 2% for the remaining 149 patients (p less than 0.001). These figures are independent of stage of disease. The 2-year survival rate by stage was as follows: I, 25%; II, 21%; III, 5%; and IV, 0% (p less than 0.001). Complete response was obtained in 18% and partial response in 41%. Complete response was dependent on the tumor stage. It was 40% for stage I disease, 23% for stage II, 11% for stage III, and 6% for stage IV disease. Similarly, a larger percentage (39%) of the 46 patients with combination surgical/radiation therapy had a complete response than of patients treated by either radiotherapy alone (n = 137, 12%) or surgery alone (n = 9, 11%). Complete response and initial performance status were important factors influencing survival (p less than 0.001). Surgery with adjuvant irradiation offered a better survival rate than radiotherapy or surgery used as single modalities. Treatment results for patients with advanced carcinoma of the esophagus remain poor.\r"

At our hospital, Staphylococcus nonaureus causes most of these infections and is uniformly sensitive to vancomycin. In a prospective study of 416 patients having cardiac operations, randomized by hospital record number, topical vancomycin was applied to the cut sternal edges in 223 patients (group V) and was omitted in the control group (C) of 193 patients. The vancomycin was applied in a hemostatic paste of topical thrombin and powdered absorbable gelatin; in the control group only the hemostatic paste was applied. All patients received prophylactic systemic antibiotics for 2 days. Sternal infection occurred in one patient in group V (0.45%) and in seven patients in group C (3.6%) (p = 0.02). Infection also correlated with longer operative times (p = 0.027). By multivariate testing, vancomycin (p = 0.013) and shorter operative times (p = 0.014) independently predicted reduced infection rates. In the one patient with an infection in group V, Staphylococcus aureus was cultured; this organism was also cultured in two patients in group C, with Staphylococcus nonaureus being the culprit in the other five patients with sternal infections in group C. Topical vancomycin applied to the cut sternal edges reduces the risk of postoperative sternal infection.\r"

Six patients had Fallot's tetralogy; five, pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect; three, truncus arteriosus; two, ventricular septal defect; and one, pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. All but one had previously undergone one or more palliative or corrective operations. Thirteen patients survived the operation (76%; 70% confidence interval = 61% to 88%) and were followed up from 2 to 56 months postoperatively (mean = 16 months). All had symmetrical pulmonary perfusion on chest x-ray films and satisfactory homograft function on Doppler echocardiograms. There were no late deaths or reoperations. Four patients (24%; 70% confidence interval = 12% to 39%) died in the hospital of pulmonary or cardiac dysfunction despite a technically satisfactory reconstruction. Comparison of predicted and observed ventricular pressure ratios in nine patients showed that the factor contributed by a right pulmonary artery branch stenois was cancelled in most. The use of a complete, adult-size homograft has thus facilitated reconstruction of the pulmonary artery bifurcation and given encouraging early results.\r"

At 6 weeks after induction of diabetes with streptozotocin in Sprague-Dawley rats we found that endoneurial glucose, sorbitol, and fructose were substantially increased and myo-Ins was decreased, as reported by others. By use of multiple linear regression to assess the effect of disease condition, time after feeding (1.5, 4, and 20 hours), and duration of diabetes (1,2,6 and 12 weeks) on nerve sugars and alcohol sugars, for nerve glucose, sorbitol, and fructose only disease condition was statistically significant factor. For nerve myo-Ins, disease group (control or diabetic rats) (P = 0.08), duration of diabetes (P = 0.02), time after feeding (P less than 0.001), duration x time (P = 0.01), group x duration (P = 0.03), and group x time (P = 0.05) were significant variables. Because nerve myo-Ins was lower at 20 hours than at 1.5 or 4 hours after feeding for all durations of diabetes, one can infer that in human nerve the lowest nerve myo-Ins, not high values, occur in the fasting state. Therefore, one would not expect to find lower nerve myo-Ins levels in human diabetics at times other than the fasting condition.\r"

Of these tumors, 46% had a DNA diploid pattern, 47% had a DNA tetraploid pattern, and 7% had a DNA aneuploid pattern. Abnormal ploidy patterns were associated more frequently with histologic high-grade tumors than with low-grade tumors. Considered alone, DNA ploidy pattern showed a strong association with subsequent prognosis. The median interval to progression for tumors with DNA tetraploid and DNA aneuploid patterns was 7.8 and 3.5 years, respectively. For the DNA diploid tumors, only 23% progressed within 18 years, the longest follow-up. At 10 years, only 10% of patients with DNA diploid tumors had died of prostatic cancer, in comparison with 28% of the DNA tetraploid and 36% of the DNA aneuploid groups (P less than 0.01). By analysis of a combination of histologic tumor grade and nuclear DNA ploidy pattern, an even stronger association with prognosis was demonstrated. For the 38 patients with histologic low-grade and DNA diploid tumors, progression-free survival was 92% at 10 years, in comparison with 57% for 23 patients with low-grade DNA nondiploid tumors. Patients with high-grade tumor had a poorer prognosis whether the DNA ploidy pattern was diploid or nondiploid. Nuclear DNA ploidy pattern is an important and independent prognostic variable for patients with pathologic stage C prostatic cancer treated by radical prostatectomy.\r"

In addition to the common pulmonary complications of diffuse interstitial lung disease, airways obstruction, desiccation of the upper respiratory tract, localized parenchymal nodules, recurrent tracheobronchitis, bronchiectasis, interstitial pneumonitis, and pleural effusion, patients with SS have a high risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that may affect the lungs. Among 50 patients with SS and associated lymphoma, 10 had pulmonary involvement by lymphoma. The mean age of these 10 patients was 59.7 years, and 8 were women. The mean duration of SS was 7.2 years, and the mean interval between the onset of SS and lymphoma was 5.4 years. Cough and slowly progressive dyspnea were the most common pulmonary symptoms, and chest roentgenographic findings varied. Lung biopsies revealed a spectrum of low-to high-grade lymphomas, and high-grade lymphomas were associated with increased mortality. Of the 10 patients, 4 died from 8 to 48 months after lymphoma was diagnosed. We conclude that pulmonary involvement is common in patients with lymphoma associated with SS; thus, lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions in patients with SS.\r"

This pacing mode combines dual-chamber and single-chamber rate-modulated technologies. Thus, it is necessary to program both a maximum tracking rate and a maximum sensor rate, as in dual-chamber and single-chamber rate-modulated devices, respectively. These two upper rate limits are usually programmed to equivalent values. The case described herein illustrates one advantage of programming discrepant upper rate limits. The rapid tracking of supraventricular tachycardias was prevented by lowering the maximum tracking rate to 100 ppm. A maximum sensor rate of 140 ppm still allowed an adequate rate response during activity.\r"

During an 18-year experience (1970 to 1988) with surgical treatment of carcinoma of the esophagus or cardia at the Lahey Clinic, 82.3% of patients with this disease were surgical candidates. Of the 310 patients who were treated surgically, 275 (88.7%) underwent resection, and the 30-day mortality rate was 2.2%. In 196 patients, gastrointestinal continuity was reestablished afterward by intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy. Cervical anastomosis was performed in 61 patients, 53 of whom had transhiatal resection. Major complications that prolonged the hospital stay occurred in 40 patients, and minor complications occurred in 28. The adjusted actuarial 5-year survival rate was 20.8% for all patients and 23.3% when only curative resections were considered. Stage of the disease was the most important determinant of long-term survival. Survival statistics were similar for patients with squamous cell epithelioma, adenocarcinoma of the cardia, or adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus.\r"

Recent success in the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with intravenous infusion of immunoglobulin suggests that the abnormal platelet agglutination in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may reflect a deficiency of immunoglobulins that normally inhibit platelet-aggregating factors or large multimers of factor VIII: von Willebrand factor.\r"

The same test has also been used since 1962 to evaluate memory function; however, the adequacy of the test in this application has been viewed with increasing skepticism in recent years. Therefore, we developed an alternative to the Wada test. It consists of selective injection of Amytal into the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). This PCA Amytal test is designed to test only memory function (not language). We present several anatomic and functional reasons why this approach should be superior to the Wada test for this purpose. We also present preliminary data in support of this hypothesis. To date, we have had successful results of the PCA Amytal test in 38 of 45 patients (84%), and one major complication has occurred (2%).\r"

Although MR imaging has been promoted as the procedure of choice for all clinical indications, on the basis of our experience myelography still plays an important role in the imaging of many spinal disorders, including disk disease. Some pathologic conditions such as intraspinal vascular malformations and leptomeningeal metastatic lesions are best imaged by myelography. MR studies have been most useful in evaluating intraspinal neoplasms, spinal cord parenchymal lesions, infections, congenital abnormalities, and \"postoperative failed back syndromes.\"\r"

Mean HbA1 levels showed a strong correlation with increasingly severe grades of retinopathy, even when differences in duration of diabetes were taken into account. Proliferative retinopathy was seen only in patients with mean HbA1 above 10%. These results support the view that the development of diabetic retinopathy is related to long-term glycaemic control and emphasise the desirability, and possible benefit, of achieving control as close to normal as is possible for each individual patient.\r"
