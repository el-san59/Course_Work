  ".W": "The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the long-term prognosis of patients with asymptomatic pressure-significant (hemodynamically significant) internal carotid system lesions. Of 640 neurologically asymptomatic patients, 292 had pressure-significant internal carotid artery occlusive lesions as determined by ocular pneumoplethysmography, while 348 had a carotid bruit only without a pressure-significant lesion. The annual stroke rate for the first three years on a Kaplan-Meier life-table basis was 3.4% and 1.5% in the abnormal and normal ocular pneumoplethysmography groups, respectively, as compared with a rate of 0.5% in a normal age- and sex-matched population. The annual total event rate (transient ischemic attack and stroke) was 5.2% in the abnormal vs 2.3% in the normal group, with 56% of all events ipsilateral to the ocular pneumoplethysmography abnormality. These results indicate that patients with asymptomatic pressure-significant carotid system occlusive lesions are at greater risk for stroke than a normal ocular pneumoplethysmography group (twofold) and a general population (sevenfold).\r"

His painting skills underwent dramatic deterioration and a concomitant decline in intellectual ability occurred. Psychological measures suggested that his visuoconstructive skills were relatively less vulnerable to disruption by Alzheimer's disease than were other cognitive functions and that the diminished artistic ability involved motivational, mnemonic, and organizational skills until the later stages of the disease. These observations may contribute to understanding the neurological basis of artistic creativity, as well as the more specific effects of Alzheimer's disease on neuropsychological abilities.\r"

We identified three complementary explanations for the poorer survival of the unmarried persons. First, unmarried persons were more likely to be diagnosed at a regional or distant stage (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence limits, 1.12 to 1.25). After adjustment for stage, unmarried persons were more likely to be untreated for cancer (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence limits, 1.31 to 1.55). Finally, after adjustment for stage and treatment, unmarried persons still had poorer survival. Previous studies have demonstrated that unmarried persons have decreased overall mortality. For cancer, our results suggest that the favorable consequence of being married on overall survival is secondary to the beneficial effects at several steps in the diagnosis, choice of treatment, and response to treatment.\r"

Additionally, 44 patients undergoing orthopedic procedures stored insufficient blood to prevent homologous blood exposure; ten of 17 patients could have avoided homologous blood if 4 U of autologous blood had been stored. Twenty-five patients undergoing nonorthopedic procedures stored an insufficient volume of blood to satisfy an unexpected transfusion need but were given transfusions of more than needed amounts of their own blood when transfusion was not clinically indicated. Future studies designed to maximize procurement of autologous blood are needed; a salutary effect on physician transfusion behavior would then be coupled with an autologous blood inventory that could eliminate homologous blood exposure in these patients.\r"

Compared to normal subjects, the correlation between plasma concentrations and the turnover rate of glycerol and free fatty acids varies in the opposite direction in nutritionally depleted and severely injured patients. The significance of plasma concentrations as an index of fat mobilization should be interpreted in relation to the clinical condition. Kinetic measurements are particularly interesting in hypermetabolic patients. Plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations are markedly affected by surgical procedures. Any delay (in treatment) following the injury and the type of intravenous regimen used have an important influence on plasma lipid levels and should be taken into account when groups of patients are studied. The infusion of exogenous fat emulsions significantly affects not only plasma triglyceride levels but also phospholipid and cholesterol concentrations and will modify the plasma lipoprotein pattern. Measurements of plasma clearance and oxidation of fat can be used to evaluate individual tolerance and the metabolic utilization of lipids, but these procedures cannot be easily applied in routine clinical practice. Regular monitoring of plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and phospholipid concentrations during and after cessation of fat infusion is recommended for each patient who is receiving daily fat infusions so that the safe rate of infusion for that individual can be determined.\r"

These include small bowel bacterial overgrowth and protein-losing enteropathy. The impact of these disorders on the indexes of nutritional status is discussed.\r"

Serum visceral protein concentrations and anthropometric parameters each were reciprocally correlated with one another, but no correlation was observed between visceral proteins and anthropometric parameters. Serum visceral proteins appeared to correlate better with the degree of liver damage than with the degree of malnutrition. Therefore, anthropometric parameters seem preferable to serum visceral proteins for the assessment of nutritional status in patients with liver cirrhosis.\r"

We have used this model, which is based on hemofiltration techniques in the dog, to study the immediate response of the kidney to the induction of CDMA. Normal dogs maintained with a NaCl-free diet for several days underwent hemofiltration of 50 ml/kg over a 35 minute period. The hemofiltrate was replaced ml for ml with a solution containing sodium and potassium in the same concentrations as found in each animal's plasma water. In control animals, the replacement solution contained chloride and bicarbonate in the same ratio as in the plasma; in the experimental (CDMA) animals the replacement solution contained bicarbonate as the only anion. In the control group, the procedure of hemofiltration coupled with isovolemic replacement caused no appreciable changes in plasma composition, urinary excretion rates, GFR, or tubular handling of bicarbonate. In the CDMA group, 106 +/- 8.4 mEq of chloride were removed in exchange for bicarbonate. A marked metabolic alkalosis resulted, plasma bicarbonate concentration increasing from 21.9 +/- 0.6 to 33.3 +/- 0.6 mEq/liter. The hemofiltration procedure itself, by design, did not alter sodium or fluid balance. Nevertheless, cumulative urinary sodium excretion increased over 2.5 hours by 23.0 +/- 6.4 mEq. A natriuresis of this magnitude is equivalent to a loss of ECF volume of approximately 200 ml. GFR did not change significantly. The rate of tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate increased significantly from 1209 +/- 82 to 1559 +/- 148 mu Eq/min in CDMA animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Protein excretion in the urine was significantly less in rats fed the high linoleic acid diet (36.9 +/- 4.4 mg/24 hr) than in those fed the low linoleic acid diet (90.1 +/- 12.5 mg/24 hr). The weight of the remnant kidney five weeks after subtotal renal ablation was greater in rats fed a low linoleic acid diet as compared to those fed a high linoleic acid diet (P less than 0.05).

Recent kidney perfusion studies demonstrate that H2O2 can cause glomerular injury by reaction with halides in the presence of the PMN cationic enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) to form oxidants which can oxidize and halogenate tissue. We sought evidence for participation of the MPO system in a model of PMN-mediated immune complex (IC) GN. A PMN-dependent model of GN was developed in rats by perfusing the renal artery with concanavalin A followed by anticoncanavalin A antibody. PMN depletion abolished glomerular PMN infiltration and significantly reduced proteinuria (35 +/- 7 mg/day vs. 113 +/- 10, P less than 0.001). Rats that received Na125I (5.0 microCi) three and six hours following disease induction had more 125I incorporation in glomeruli and GBM at 48 hours than similarly treated rats that were PMN depleted (1200 cpm vs. 88 cpm, P less than 0.01). Glomerular iodination could not be demonstrated in a PMN-independent model of nephrotoxic nephritis induced with noncomplement fixing anti-GBM antibody. These data indicate that this model of PMN-mediated IC GN is associated with activation of the MPO-H2O2-halide system, which may participate in mediating glomerular injury.\r"

Z-Phenylalanyl-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin served as substrate. Enzyme activities, proteinuria, creatinine clearance and renal morphology were determined at specific time intervals following induction of PAN nephrosis. During the first three days following PAN injection, enzyme activities in S2 and S3 segments, protein excretion, creatinine clearance and appearance of the renal parenchyma resembled control animals. The enzyme activity in S1 segments was slightly decreased, but returned to control levels at day six after injection. Days four through eight post-PAN injection were characterized by a dramatic increase in protein excretion and an increase in cathepsin B and L activity in S2 and S3 segments of the proximal tubule. During days 9 through 15 enzyme activity decreased significantly in S2 segments despite continued proteinuria. Overt necrosis and cell injury were seen in the proximal tubule and probably account for the decrease in proteolytic activity. After day 15 following PAN injection, the level of proteinuria decreased, restoration of cathepsin activities occurred and a histopathologic picture of healing was present. The data suggest a positive relationship exists between stimulation of cathepsin B and L activity in S2 and S3 segments of the proximal tubule and increased protein filtration in PAN nephrosis. The increased enzyme activity reflects enhancement of the proteolytic capacity of the lysosomal system that is necessary for increased protein catabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Serum concentrations of apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, B, C-I, C-II, C-III and E were determined by electroimmunoassay in 56 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) in the predialytic phase. The results were compared with those obtained in asymptomatic normolipidemic subjects, patients with type IV hyperlipoproteinemia, and patients with type II diabetes mellitus. CRF patients had reduced concentrations of ApoA-I and ApoA-II, normal levels of ApoB and ApoC-I, and increased concentrations of ApoC-II and, in particular, of ApoC-III. There was a significant reduction in the levels of ApoE, especially in male patients. In comparison with type IV, hyperlipoproteinemic patients, CRF patients had lower concentrations of ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoB, ApoC-I and, particularly, ApoE; there was no difference in ApoC-III levels reflecting the hypertriglyceridemia common to both disorders. Similar but less marked differences were also found in comparison with type II diabetics. The findings suggest that in CRF, the accumulation of ApoC-III-enriched lipoprotein particles accompanied by a moderate hypertriglyceridemia may be caused more probably by an impaired catabolism than overproduction of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. CRF patients with vascular disease tended to have higher serum concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol and ApoB and lower ApoA-I/ApoC-III and ApoA-I/ApoB ratios than patients without vascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "Tubular sodium handling in humans undergoing hypotonic expansion due to the administration of antidiuretic hormone was studied using the clearance of lithium as an index of distal filtrate and sodium delivery. Clearance studies were performed in the morning in eight normal subjects before and on the fourth day of intranasal I-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) administration. Fluid intake was kept constant at 25 ml/kg body weight. After dDAVP body weight increased (2.5 +/- 0.4 kg), plasma sodium fell (from 143 +/- 1 to 128 +/- 5 mmol/liter) and a progressive natriuresis developed. Sodium balance remained negative up to the second clearance study, when the cumulative sodium loss amounted to 148 +/- 96 mmol. Plasma renin activity fell significantly, but plasma aldosterone did not. Inulin clearance rose from 110 +/- 14 to 135 +/- 23 ml/min and lithium clearance from 30.9 +/- 7.6 to 48.9 +/- 15.1 ml/min. Fractional reabsorption of uric acid, phosphate and calcium decreased. Together these changes suggest that the negative sodium balance in hypotonic expansion with dDAVP results from increased filtered sodium load, decreased fractional reabsorption in the proximal tubules, and increased distal delivery. Estimated fractional reabsorption in the distal nephron remained unaltered. The plasma concentration of lithium, of which 10.8 mmol was ingested on the eve of the clearance studies, was not lower during the dDAVP-clearance study. This indicates that the tubular adaptations mentioned are present intermittently, in particular during daytime.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether plasma growth hormone is necessary for the amino acid-induced rise in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF, PAH clearance) and GFR (inulin clearance), arginine HCl, 500 mg/kg, was infused for 30 minutes into eight normal and six growth hormone-deficient individuals. During infusion, ERPF increased in the normal and growth hormone-deficient subjects by 28.9 +/- 11.4 SD-% (P less than 0.01) and 46.5 +/- 14.4% (P less than 0.001). GFR rose by 23.7 +/- 5.9% (P less than 0.05) and 42.7 +/- 29.1% (P less than 0.001) in the two groups. Plasma growth hormone rose only in the normal subjects, while glucagon increased in both groups. Infusion of arginine HCl, 200 mg/kg, into normals increased ERPF and GFR without increasing plasma osmolality. Lower arginine doses essentially did not affect ERPF, GFR, growth hormone, or glucagon. Infusion of D-glucose into normals raised plasma osmolality as high as with arginine HCl, 500 mg/kg, but increased ERPF only slightly and not GFR; D-glucose infusion caused a delayed rise in growth hormone that was unassociated with an increase in ERPF or GFR. An infusion of ammonium chloride with sodium chloride, which provided an amount of chloride similar to the 500 mg/kg arginine HCl dose, did not change ERPF and GFR; this suggests that the chloride load did not cause the altered renal hemodynamics stimulated by arginine HCl. These findings indicate that neither normal plasma growth hormone levels nor a rise in growth hormone mediates the arginine-induced acute increase in ERPF or GFR. This effect is also not due to the osmolar load but could be caused by the rise in plasma glucagon.\r"

The average follow-up time of this longitudinal study was 27 months (range 6-67 months). The patients were divided into two groups: Group A, those showing one or more increases of AC; and Group B, patients in whom AC either did not develop or decreased during the follow-up. There was no significant difference in serum Ca, P, Ca X P, alkaline phosphatase of iPTH between the two groups. However, serum Mg was significantly lower in Group A than in Group B (2.69 +/- 0.52 and 3.02 +/- 0.51 mg/dl, respectively, P less than 0.001), while the ratios P/Mg and Ca X P/Mg were significantly higher. Our observations suggest that in end-stage renal disease hypermagnesemia may retard the development of arterial calcifications.\r"

Seventeen stenotic lesions detected by fistulogram underwent elective PTA. Twelve of these lesions were detected after thrombectomy and five were detected because of increased venous pressures during dialysis. Fourteen attempts at PTA were completely successful in restoring functional patency to the vascular graft. Three attempts were unsuccessful; two of these three grafts were subsequently repaired surgically. Venous stenoses that extended far greater than 6 cm were not considered for PTA. We conclude that PTA is a technique of promise in the non-surgical salvage of failing PTFE grafts. PTA can prolong the useful life of PTFE vascular access grafts and can be performed on an outpatient basis, eliminating the hospitalization that is usually required for surgical revision.\r"

In men, alcohol increases self-disclosure, but only at a moderate blood alcohol level. Expectations emerged as a powerful influence on self-disclosure. Men who believed that they and their female partner were both intoxicated showed increased self-disclosure although no alcohol was consumed. Women who believed that they were intoxicated showed the opposite pattern of a decrease in self-disclosure. Another gender difference was that moderate alcohol had no effect on women's self-disclosure. The self-awareness model of alcohol use failed to receive support.\r"

These groups did not differ in age, weight or absolute alcohol per kg of body weight typically consumed on social occasions. After drinking absolute alcohol (0.83 ml/kg), subjects performed bead stringing and hand steadiness tasks when their blood alcohol levels (BALs) averaged 63 mg/dl on the rising and the declining limb of the BAL curve. The experiments consistently demonstrated that FH+ individuals displayed a greater degree of impairment on the tasks. One of the experiments also explored subjective ratings of the effects of alcohol at matching BALs and found no significant group differences. The greater behavioral sensitivity to alcohol of FH+ subjects and their apparent absence of a concomitant enhanced perception of its effects were discussed as a potential component of their higher risk of developing problem drinking.\r"

Repeatability (test-retest correlation) for alcohol clearance rate was near 0, with repeatabilities between .40 and .55 for peak BAL, time-to-peak BAL, average session BAL and relative volume of alcohol distribution. Repeatabilities of prealcohol baseline scores were generally high (median, .71) for the CARTA battery of physiological, motor coordination, perceptual speed and reaction time measures, but were only low to moderate for sensitivity scores (median, .27) and acute tolerance scores (median, .25) calculated on these measures. There was some evidence that repeatabilities for alcohol metabolism, sensitivity and acute tolerance were lower for women than for men.\r"

The subjects were male alcoholics, problem drinkers and nonproblem drinkers. The central finding was that drinker group membership and rated dose level interacted in predicting subjects' estimates of the usefulness of alcohol for them. On the \"useful for feeling better\" factor, the greatest benefit was expected from a moderate dose, particularly among alcoholics. On the \"useful for relieving emotional distress\" factor, usefulness ratings increased with dose, with alcoholics expecting the greatest rate of increase. A similar pattern was found for the \"useful for feeling in charge\" factor, except that the ratings for problem drinkers and alcoholics paralleled each other. These findings have implications for our efforts to understand drinkers' motivations to initiate and continue drinking.\r"

Respondents were convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) and were assessed for the significance of their drinking problem at 34 DWI assessing agencies. Counselor decisions served as the criterion measure and were considered to be independent of the test scores. The finding revealed that counselors identified lower rates of problem drinking than are generally found to exist in this population. The MAST performance, although statistically impressive, was believed to be mediated by the low rate of counselor-identified problem drinkers. The MFQ, more moderate in its performance, shows promise for improvement based on recommended modifications. CAGE findings suggest little support for its use as a single index of problem drinking with this population. However, it would appear to be a statistical asset to the item pool of a more comprehensive screening inventory. The criterion used in the study did not provide a satisfactory range of problem drinking with which to evaluate the adequacy of these instruments as wide-range assessment inventories. The social-legal mandate to reduce the incidence of DWI will require not only more comprehensive definitions of problem drinking but more extensive study of repeat offenders for the identification of other subgroups as well.\r"

To determine whether such myocardial injury is recoverable with biventricular support, we subjected 10 dogs to 45 minutes of ischemia at 37 degrees C. After ischemia, the animals were supported for 24 hours with biventricular assist with the centrifugal pump. During early reperfusion, none of the hearts could sustain a stable rhythm or blood pressure. Myocardial adenosine triphosphate concentration, expressed as micromoles per gram of heart protein, was dramatically reduced from a control of 31.5 +/- 2.4 to 14.6 +/- 2.9 (p less than 0.01 versus control), a 54% reduction. Ultrastructural analysis did not reveal the explosive cell swelling of irreversible cell injury. After 12 hours of biventricular assist, developed pressure partially recovered to 60.0 +/- 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.01 versus control) and maximal positive dP/dt measured 2,649 +/- 412 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.01 versus control). Adenosine triphosphate concentration increased to 25.2 +/- 5.5 (p less than 0.01 versus control). Electron microscopic examination showed less chromatin clumping, no further mitochondrial distortion, and more abundant glycogen. After 24 hours of biventricular assist, cardiac output in the seven dogs successfully weaned from biventricular assist measured 3.6 +/- 0.6 L/min, developed pressure recovered to 76.3 +/- 8.9 mm Hg, and its first derivative recovered to 4,282 +/- 585 mm Hg/sec (all measurements not significant compared with control). Examination by an electron microscope revealed no severe mitochondrial injury.\r"

  ".W": "To more clearly characterize the role of computed tomography in staging the mediastinal lymph nodes of patients with lung cancer, we analyzed computed tomographic and surgical findings in the chest in 345 consecutive patients with lung cancer who underwent operative staging. Patients were grouped according to the TNM staging system of the American Joint Commission, central or peripheral location of the primary tumor, lobar location of the tumor, and maximum tumor diameter as determined by computed tomography or gross pathology. One third of patients with abnormal findings on the computed tomographic scan did not have mediastinal lymph node metastases. Mediastinal metastases occurred frequently in patients with central cancers (38%). The predictive value of a negative scan in all patients was high (greater than or equal to 90%) except for patients with central T3 lesions (72%), left upper lobe lesions (83%), and central adenocarcinomas (75%). However, only the differences between central T3 and central T2 or T1 lesions, and between central adenocarcinomas and central squamous cell carcinomas, were unlikely to be due to chance alone (p less than 0.05). None of the lobar differences were statistically significant. The frequency of mediastinal metastases in patients with peripheral lesions was 15% (28 of 192 patients); computed tomography correctly identified enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes in all but seven patients. However, there were no true-positive computed tomographic scans in 59 patients with peripheral lesions 2 cm in diameter or smaller; accordingly, we suggest that computed tomography is not indicated for the sole purpose of mediastinal staging in this group. Ninety-four percent of patients in this series undergoing thoracotomy with a curative intent had a curative resection. Only 4% had unresectable lesions; palliative resections were done in 2%.\r"

Anterior (parasternal) mediastinotomy can be used to assess only the former compartment. This procedure alone, if not done in conjunction with standard cervical mediastinoscopy, will fail to disclose technically unresectable N2 or N3 disease of the left upper lobe involving the superior mediastinum. We have developed a technique to explore and sample nodes from both regions by extending a standard cervical mediastinoscopy, eliminating the need for a second incision when the anterior mediastinal compartment requires assessment. We have prospectively analyzed the first 100 procedures that we performed. This technique has been found to be accurate and exceptionally safe with one superficial wound infection as the only complication. We can recommend this single staging procedure for preoperative assessment of bronchogenic carcinomas of the left upper lobe.\r"

Computed tomography was associated with a sensitivity of 71.0%, a specificity of 87.7% and an overall accuracy of 82.1%. Magnetic resonance imaging did not provide any advantage over computed tomography in the assessment of mediastinal node status. The accuracy of computed tomography was not dependent on cell type of the primary tumor. Although chest roentgenography had a sensitivity of 80.7%, the overall accuracy of 57.1% was unacceptably low. The sensitivity (87.1%), specificity (100%), positive (100%) and negative (93.0%) predictive values, and accuracy (95.2%) of mediastinoscopy exceeded those observed with all other modalities. We continue to recommend mediastinoscopy as the most accurate staging investigation in the routine management of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis tested in this study was whether a skeletal muscle could be transformed to be fatigue resistant, to be used to power an implantable extra-aortic balloon assist device, and therefore to provide dynamically significant cardiac assistance. Eight dogs underwent implantation of an Itrel pacemaker to stimulate the thoracodorsal nerve over 8 to 18 weeks and transform the latissimus dorsi muscle. Biopsies of these muscles confirmed near complete (up to 98%) transformation into fatigue-resistance type I muscle fibers, identified by the adenosinetriphosphatase histochemical stains. Biochemical assays showed conversion of myosin isoforms to that of myocardial V3 phenotype, decreased activity of anaerobic glycolytic marker, and increased activity of aerobic enzyme marker, which indicated greater resemblance of such muscle to the myocardial fibers. In four dogs, the optimal stimulation parameters of such muscles in response to a burst stimulator, which synchronizes and summates the muscle contraction, were studied and compared with the contralateral, nontransformed muscle. Fatigue tests confirmed the marked fatigue resistance of the transformed muscle. In four dogs, a 100 ml balloon was placed beneath the transformed latissimus dorsi muscle and connected to the thoracic aorta with a Dacron graft. By means of the optimal burst-stimulating parameters identified above, the latissimus dorsi muscle was stimulated to contract during diastole, compressing the balloon to achieve diastolic augmentation while allowing the balloon to fill during systole. A 39% increase (p less than 0.001) in the \"subendocardial viability index\" (diastolic pressure-time index/tension-time index) was obtained as calculated from the left ventricular and ascending aortic pressure tracings. We conclude that the skeletal muscle can be transformed to resemble myocardium, which can generate sufficient force to provide hemodynamically significant and clinically relevant counterpulsation.\r"

Once the muscles were conditioned, oxygen consumption was measured during periods of exercise. The ratio of the tension developed to oxygen consumed during moderate stimulation (300 msec on) for the control and the electrically conditioned muscles was 16.3 +/- 3.5 and 36.5 +/- 6.7 kg-sec/ml oxygen, respectively. During intense stimulation (800 msec on) the ratio was 12.6 +/- 2.1 and 54.2 +/- 8.9 kg-sec/ml oxygen, respectively. Thus the conditioned muscle was able to develop and maintain tension with a considerably reduced oxygen expenditure. The increased efficiency of the conditioned muscle helps to explain its increased resistance to fatigue and the ability of pumping chambers constructed from electrically preconditioned skeletal muscle to perform sustained cardiac type work.\r"

Fourteen patients had intractable sepsis resulting from infective endocarditis and myocardial abscess and 10 patients had noninfectious disorders. Of the patients with infections, 12 had valvular endocarditis with periannular abscess and three had interventricular septal abscess. The noninfected patients had acute rupture of the ventricular wall after mitral valve replacement (one patient) heavily calcified or surgically absent mitral anulus (three patients), or rupture of the interventricular septum after acute myocardial infarction (six patients). The interventricular septum, the posterior wall of the left ventricle, and the periannular areas were reconstructed by suturing appropriately tailored pericardial patches directly to the endocardium. In patients who also required valve replacement, the prosthetic valve was partially or completely secured to the pericardial patch. There were three operative deaths. All three patients were in either septic or cardiogenic shock before operation and in none of them was the death related to the pericardial patch. All 22 survivors have been observed from 3 to 34 months, an average of 14 months. There has been no case of patch dehiscence, patch aneurysm, prosthetic valve dehiscence, or recurrent endocarditis. Autologous pericardium appears to be safe for reconstruction of the left ventricle. It is easy to handle and problems with suture line bleeding are practically nonexistent.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to assess the long-term effects of balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta. Eleven asymptomatic children, aged 4 to 6 years, underwent balloon angioplasty. Mean peak gradient fell from 50.5 +/- 4.7 mm Hg before angioplasty to 21.7 +/- 3.1 immediately after angioplasty. Children were then followed up at 3 to 6 month intervals and were recatherized 5 to 14 months after balloon angioplasty. On the basis of these catheterization findings, patients were divided into three groups: group I--four patients, residual gradient less than 10 mm Hg and no anatomic abnormalities; Group II--three patients, increase of gradient to greater than 25 mm Hg, mean 34 mm Hg; Group III--four patients, aneurysmal dilatation in the area of the balloon angioplasty. The seven patients in groups II and III underwent elective resection of their coarctation at 7 to 28 months after balloon angioplasty with end-to-end anastomosis. Somatosensory evoked potentials were monitored during the operation. There were no operative deaths and no gradients between arm and leg pressures postoperatively. One patient had mild paresis of the lower extremities. Pathologic examination of the specimens revealed an absence of muscle and elastic lamella in the area of the aneurysms. This finding was present in all specimens regardless of whether there was aneurysmal dilatation. Neofibroelastic proliferation at the site of the tear was responsible for persistent gradients. Balloon angioplasty may result in aneurysmal formation and/or recurrent stenosis in the area of the tear necessitating elective surgical repair. Surgical treatment is the same as for native coarctation when done early after balloon angioplasty, but may be associated with increased risk because of the lack of collateral circulation. Continued follow-up of these lesions is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Patch graft angioplasty for coarctation repair has been associated with late aneurysm formation opposite the prosthetic patch in some patients. Etiologic possibilities for this aneurysm formation include congenital abnormality of the aortic wall, surgical interruption of the vasa vasorum, intimal disruption because of extensive excision of the coarctation web, and rigidity of the prosthetic patch. To assess the effect of extensive intimal excision on the development of aneurysms, we operated on 12 dogs, performing a left thoracotomy and aortoplasty with Dacron (n = 6) or polytetrafluoroethylene patches (n = 6) and concomitant intimal excision opposite the patch. Ten control dogs underwent angioplasty with Dacron (n = 5) and polytetrafluoroethylene patches (n = 5) without excision of the intima. Serial aortograms of all animals showed aneurysm formation of the aorta opposite the patch in eight of the 12 dogs undergoing intimal excision. In contrast, no aneurysms developed in the control dogs (p less than 0.001). An additional five dogs underwent longitudinal aortotomy, intimal excision, and primary closure. Three dogs in this group demonstrated an aneurysm angiographically (p less than 0.02). Histologic analysis of the aneurysms and the control aortas revealed hyperplastic ingrowth of the intima over the denuded surface in the animals undergoing intimal excision. The elastic fibers in the media were intact and organized except in two aneurysmal specimens. We conclude that extensive resection of the intima with or without patch angioplasty predisposes aneurysm formation opposite the aortotomy and should be avoided during coarctation repair.\r"

  ".W": "Emboli in the brain microvasculature may inhibit brain activity during cardiopulmonary bypass. Such hypothetical blockade, if confirmed, may be responsible for the reduction of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose observed in animals subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass. In previous studies of cerebral blood flow during bypass, brain microcirculation was not evaluated. In the present study in animals (pigs), reduction of the number of perfused capillaries was estimated by measurements of the capillary diffusion capacity for hydrophilic tracers of low permeability. Capillary diffusion capacity, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral metabolic rate for glucose were measured simultaneously by the integral method, different tracers being used with different circulation times. In eight animals subjected to normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, and seven subjected to hypothermic bypass, cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, and capillary diffusion capacity decreased significantly: cerebral blood flow from 63 to 43 ml/100 gm/min in normothermia and to 34 ml/100 gm/min in hypothermia and cerebral metabolic rate for glucose from 43.0 to 23.0 mumol/100 gm/min in normothermia and to 14.1 mumol/100 gm/min in hypothermia. The capillary diffusion capacity declined markedly from 0.15 to 0.03 ml/100 gm/min in normothermia but only to 0.08 ml/100 gm/min in hypothermia. We conclude that the decrease of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass is caused by interruption of blood flow through a part of the capillary bed, possibly by microemboli, and that cerebral blood flow is an inadequate indicator of capillary blood flow. Further studies must clarify why normal microvascular function appears to be preserved during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

Mean age was 57.6 years (standard deviation 12.4); 14 were 70 years or older. Twenty-three had a previous cardiac operation and 22 had additional procedures performed at the time of double valve replacement. Before the operation 62% of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III and 29% were in class IV or required emergency operation. There were six (6.5%) deaths within 30 days. None of the hospital deaths were valve related; all occurred in patients who had additional risk concerns. Follow-up is 100% complete and ranges from 2 to 80 months, totaling 242 patient-years (mean 33.8 months). All except four hospital survivors reached class I or II and 40 patients (47%) remain asymptomatic. The actuarial survival rates are 82% at 1 year, 70% at 3 years, and 60% at 5 years. Causes of late death include heart failure (10), sudden, unexplained death (five), reoperation for coronary artery disease (one), noncardiac (four), and valve related (five). The linearized rate of fatal valve-related events is 2.1% pt-yr. A total of 22 valve-related complications (including five fatal) occurred is 18 patients, for a linearized rate or incidence of 9.1%/pt-yr. Eleven thromboembolic episodes (rate 4.6%/pt-yr) occurred in nine patients; three of these (1.2%/pt-yr) were fatal. Thromboembolic and bleeding complications represented 64% of all valve-related complications. Four patients had six episodes of prosthetic valve endocarditis (incidence 2.5%/pt-yr), of which one (incidence 0.4%/pt-yr) was fatal. Paravalvular leak contributed to the fifth valve-related death. At 5 years, 83% of patients were free of thromboembolic complications; 94% were free of anticoagulant-related hemorrhage; and 71% were free of all valve-related complications. There are few comparable data for patients who have had simultaneous replacement of aortic and mitral valves with other mechanical prostheses. The total incidence of valve-related complications for patients with bioprostheses ranges between 3.9%/pt-yr and 10.4%/pt-yr and is similar to the 9.1%/pt-yr observed in the present series. The type of valve-related complication (thromboemboli and bleeding versus valve deterioration) is the principal difference between St. Jude Medical and bioprosthetic valves in patients who require simultaneous replacement of aortic and mitral valves.\r"

Five-year survival rates were similar in patients undergoing operation between 1965 and 1974 and after 1975, despite an increase in age and in the severity of preoperative symptoms in the recent group. Late mortality was due to sudden death in 38% of the patients, heart failure in 21%, reoperation in 5%, endocarditis in 2%, and thromboembolism and bleeding in 4%.

The hearts were chemically arrested by St. Thomas' Hospital solution and made totally ischemic for 35 minutes at 37 degrees C. In the presence of phosphocreatine, 10 mmol/L, during ischemia, almost complete recovery of heart function and phosphocreatine content and 61% recovery of adenosine triphosphate content were observed after 30 minutes of postischemic reperfusion; in the control experiments without phosphocreatine, contractile function, intracellular phosphocreatine, and adenosine triphosphate contents were restored to 33%, 43%, and 26% of their normal values, respectively. Ultrastructural studies with a lanthanum tracer method showed remarkable protection of sarcolemma against ischemic injury by exogenous phosphocreatine at the level of the glycocalyx.\r"

One hundred eighty-nine intact or partially removed pacemaker leads were abandoned in situ in 152 patients between Jan. 1, 1965, and Dec. 31, 1985. The leads, sometimes several leads in a single patient, were deemed uninfected at the time of abandonment in 137 patients and contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis in 15 patients. All of the contaminated leads have remained clinically uninfected during follow-up. One clean lead became infected early after implantation and the patient died after an open cardiac operation to remove that lead and an adjacent abandoned lead that was adherent to the subclavian vein. No other patient has had a late complication during follow-up to 256 months (mean 47.6). Properly managed abandonment of an uninfected lead can carry a very low complication rate.\r"

  ".W": "Anomalous origin of the left anterior descending coronary artery from the right coronary artery can interfere with the location of the usual ventriculotomy during repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of two operative techniques: (1) a \"tailored\" right ventricular incision and outflow patch reconstruction and (2) placement of a conduit from the right ventricle to the main pulmonary artery. We reviewed the records of 416 patients who had complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot at the Mayo Clinic from 1973 through 1984. Twenty (5%) (median age 6.5 years) had anomalous origin of the left anterior descending coronary artery from the right coronary artery. Twelve of these patients had right ventricular outflow patch reconstruction, and eight had placement of a conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. Three deaths occurred, all during hospitalization, two in the patch reconstruction group and one in the conduit group. The average reduction in right ventricular pressure postoperatively was slightly but not significantly greater for the conduit group. These data indicate that correction of tetralogy of Fallot with anomalous origin of the left anterior descending coronary artery can be done with either patch reconstruction or conduit placement. Selection of the more appropriate procedure depends on the exact location and degree of tortuosity of the anomalous artery and the level and severity of right ventricular outflow obstruction.\r"

No morbidity or mortality occurred during the program, and most patients achieved a substantial improvement in exercise capacity. During a follow-up interval of a mean of 29.7 +/- 13.0 months, four patients died, an annualized mortality of 8 +/- 4%. The outcome of cardiac rehabilitation was assessed 19.1 +/- 4.4 months after completion of the supervised program. Of the 16 survivors, all of whom had been fully employed before their most recent myocardial infarction, 9 (56%) had returned to full-time work, 6 (38%) were medically disabled, and 1 was retired (age 73 years) but fully active. Of the 16 survivors, 13 (81%) completed a questionnaire about their perceptions of their current quality of life. Of the 13 patients, 12 (92%) had continued to exercise regularly. Four patients (31%) reported the ability to perform all desired activities without symptoms, whereas nine patients (69%) noted some impairment in their functional capacity. Thus, in this group of patients with profound left ventricular dysfunction, the rehabilitation potential, as evidenced by return to productive employment and the ability to perform desired activities-including exercise training-was generally favorable.\r"

In the 29 infants whose mothers were receiving either a relaxed diet or a normal diet at conception but who started a strict diet at some time during pregnancy, birthweights and head circumferences were below those in healthy infants and there was an excess of malformations; the findings closely resembled those for the 18 infants whose mothers received no treatment during pregnancy. The birthweights and head circumferences of the 64 infants were inversely related to the maternal phenylalanine concentrations around the time of conception. Only a strict diet started before conception is likely to prevent fetal damage.\r"

In patients with HFI (n = 5) ingestion of small amounts of fructose was followed by an increase in sugar phosphates and decrease in inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the liver that could be detected by 31P-MRS. 31P-MRS could be used to diagnose fructose intolerance and to monitor the patients' compliance with a fructose-restricted diet. In heterozygotes (n = 8) 50 g fructose given orally led to accumulation of sugar phosphates and depletion of Pi in the liver. Fructose also induced a larger increase in plasma urate in heterozygotes than in control subjects. The effect of fructose on liver Pi and plasma urate was most pronounced in heterozygotes with gout (n = 3). Heterozygosity for HFI may predispose to hyperuricaemia.\r"

There was a clear relation between pre-treatment and post-treatment theophylline clearance rates, indicating that the greatest effect of interferon was in subjects who were fast metabolisers of theophylline. These observations support the contention that the actions of endogenous interferon may account for the effects of immunisations and viral infections on hepatic drug metabolism. Moreover, treatment with interferon may cause clinically important drug interactions.\r"

  ".W": "57 healthy Dutch women were studied longitudinally from early pregnancy until 2 months post partum. Regular measurements were made of energy intake in food, basal metabolic rate, body weight and body fat mass, and levels of physical activity. Some data were obtained before conception in 23 women. The energy cost of pregnancy calculated as the energy deposited as new tissues plus the associated increase in basal metabolism amounted to 286 MJ (1020 kJ/day), which is only 11% lower than the theoretical estimate of requirements of 323 MJ (1 MJ = 239 kcal). Energy intake throughout the first 10 wk of pregnancy was identical to that before pregnancy. Energy intake was only 200 kJ/day higher in late than in early pregnancy (not significant), and the cumulative increase in energy intake over pregnancy was estimated as 22 MJ (about 80 kJ/day). There is, therefore, an energy gap in pregnancy of about 940 kJ/day. It is proposed that the main mechanisms by which the pregnant body is able to save energy and to bridge the energy gap are by adjustments to physical activity and an increase in work efficiency and an adaptation of the metabolic response to food. Savings on physical activity by behavioural adaptations will not exceed 355 kJ/day.\r"

BMR increased by 100 MJ overall and maternal fat gain averaged about 1.3 kg, equivalent to 60 MJ. The energy cost was more than covered by an overall increase in food intake of 238 MJ with little evidence of any complementary reduction in total energy expenditure by reduced physical activity.\r"

The overall mortality rate (for all deaths except external causes) was lower among prisoners (SMR = 84; p less than 0.05). Moreover, the risk of dying from all causes, as well as from malignant neoplasms, diseases of the circulatory system, and suicides fell significantly with increasing duration of imprisonment. These findings suggest that the lifestyle specific to imprisonment might overcome the prejudicial effect of risk factors such as alcohol, tobacco, or drug abuse that tend to be common among prisoners.\r"

A substantial proportion of the variance of the plasma fibrinogen level, 51%, was accounted for by genetic heritability, whereas the cultural heritability was negligible. No intergenerational differences were indicated in genetic or cultural heritability. The combined effect of obesity and smoking was found to explain 3% of the variance of the plasma fibrinogen level. The demonstration of such substantial genetic control further supports the view that plasma fibrinogen is a primary risk factor for CHD rather than a reflection of the severity of manifest disease.\r"

Pre-eclampsia (arterial pressure above 140/90 mm Hg with proteinuria above ++) developed in 4 of 12 previously bacteriuric women known to have renal scarring (5 of 16 pregnancies), in only 1 of 22 previously bacteriuric women without scars (1 of 36 pregnancies), and in 1 of 52 controls (p less than 0.001). Women with renal scars were also more likely to undergo induction of labour (44% of pregnancies) and operative delivery (57% of pregnancies) than previously bacteriuric mothers without scars (17%, 22%) or control mothers (16%, 20%). The infants of previously bacteriuric mothers were not significantly smaller than those of healthy control mothers, but Apgar scores were lower among offspring of previously bacteriuric mothers with scarred or normal kidneys (p less than 0.001). Fetal outcome was, however, satisfactory in all cases.\r"

The microvasculature of the cheek pouch was studied by a fluorescent video-microscopy technique after the animals had been injected with fluorescent native or glycosylated albumin or with both. Native albumin remained in the cheek pouch microvasculature, whereas glycosylated albumin leaked out of the microvascular bed along the postcapillary and collecting venules. The extravascular leakage of glycosylated albumin, probably due to its electrical or conformational change, may represent the initial event in the development of diabetic microangiopathy.\r"

PMN from patients with bronchiectasis contained significantly more of the serine proteinase elastase than did the control cells, which may have contributed to their greater extracellular proteolysis. PMN from patients with emphysema, but not those with bronchiectasis, showed enhanced chemotaxis (on average 260%) in response to a chemotactic peptide compared with control cells. Thus, PMN from subjects with chronic obstructive lung diseases can digest more extracellular connective tissue protein than PMN from healthy subjects. This behaviour suggests a mechanism for the pathological tissue damage associated with these disorders. Furthermore, the sensitivity to chemotactic factors of PMN from emphysematous patients would contribute to the larger numbers of these cells in their lung tissues, thus increasing further the proteolytic burden in the lungs.\r"

Occupational structure was represented by the proportion of workers in white-collar jobs. A negative association, with lower mortality in communities with higher levels of white-collar employment, emerged over the period in both men and women. The results for men may be interpreted as suggesting a recapitulation in the US of the changing association between social class and heart disease observed in Britain. Occupational structure, however, reflects resources and opportunities in a community derived from its contribution to the national and international economy. Thus the growing inequalities in heart disease mortality presented in this ecological study relate more appropriately to communities than to individual workers.\r"

Although it acts as an antioestrogen by binding to oestrogen receptors, it also has oestrogen agonistic effects on the liver. Recent toxicity studies in rats have revealed that after high dosages both cataracts and hepatocellular carcinomas develop. For these reasons it has been suggested that use of tamoxifen be discontinued for the treatment of benign conditions such as severe cyclical mastalgia and also for trials on the prevention of breast cancer. It is argued that the development of hepatocellular carcinomas in rats is the result of the known oestrogen agonist activity of tamoxifen, with similar results being found in a few women receiving oral contraceptives, the use of which still continues. Studies of the use of the agent for benign conditions should evolve in the context of controlled clinical trials in order that important new indications for tamoxifen are not overlooked.\r"

At certain times of year, however, pre-harvest food shortages and the energy demands of subsistence farming did substantially reduce maternal fat stores and fetal growth. Dietary supplementation, already known to increase birthweight, also had measurable effects on the mothers' physiology, resulting in increased energy expenditure on basal metabolism and improving maternal fat deposition. These findings suggest that the precise energy cost of pregnancy varies as a function of the additional energy intake consumed at this crucial period.\r"

The Kaplan-Meier patient survival estimates at 4 years were 74% for haemodialysis and 62% for CAPD; technique survival figures for the same period were 91% for haemodialysis and 61% for CAPD. Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis showed that cerebrovascular/cardiovascular disease, age over 60 years, and diabetes mellitus were important predictors for survival in CAPD patients; there were no risk factors associated with permanent change to haemodialysis. In the haemodialysis group early change to CAPD was associated with presence of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease. The major cause of drop-out in both groups was transplantation. The mean length of hospital admission was 14.8 days per patient-year for CAPD and 12.4 days per patient-year for haemodialysis.\r"

In two cases, the test results positively identified individuals before the clinical diagnosis of DNS. A clinically normal obligate carrier of the HCMM/DNS gene showed the enhanced G2 radiosensitivity. Moreover, in a test on 1 proband, the sensitivity was apparent in peripheral blood lymphoblasts. Enhanced G2 chromatid radiosensitivity may be a marker of genetic susceptibility to HCMM/DNS.\r"

The cumulative energy cost of pregnancy over the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was 189 MJ (1130 kJ/day). There was no increase in energy intake, rather a very small reduction over the final two trimesters. Changes in physical activity provided part of the estimated energy needs (375-415 kJ/day throughout the second and third trimesters of pregnancy). These measurements leave an unexplained deficit of at least 700 kJ/day. Nevertheless, there was an adequate mean birthweight (2885 g) and a 10% incidence of low birthweight. The findings seem to suggest that pregnancy outcome can be successful despite marginal energy intake.\r"

An intact canal wall procedure was performed in 92 patients while the remainder (N = 363) underwent a canal-down operation. The hearing results for both procedures are dependent on the presence of the stapes superstructure. When the stapes superstructure was intact, 52% of the patients with canal-up operations had an air-bone gap of less than 20 dB. The corresponding figure for canal-down cases was 37%. When there was no stapes superstructure, 54% of the canal-up cases and 19% of the canal-down cases obtained a similar ABG closure. Preserving the posterior external auditory canal wall results in slightly better hearing function. However, when the stapes superstructure is intact, the difference in hearing function is not remarkable, and must be weighed against the potential for residual disease or recurrence associated with canal-up procedures.\r"

Aspiration pneumonia has not been seen in any patient after placement of the appropriate stent, with follow-up of 2 to 6 months. One patient's swallowing improved and none deteriorated.

Synechiae were the most commonly occurring minor complications. Endoscopic nasal sinus surgery performed by inexperienced operators carries with it the same risks and complications as traditional intranasal sinus surgery. Any surgeon who does not routinely perform traditional intranasal ethmoidectomy should accrue endoscopic experience through appropriate didactic training and multiple cadaver dissections (akin to otologic training).\r"

  ".U": "88037893\r", 
  ".W": "The modified Lynch operation (Neel-Lake) differs in several ways from the operation described by Lynch. The operation begins with an intranasal anterior ethmoidectomy. The agger nasi cells are removed by curetting forward between the frontal process of the maxilla and the septum. The middle turbinate, normal-appearing mucosa of the frontal-ethmoid complex, and frontal process of the superior maxilla are preserved. Bone removal is limited in most cases to the anterior floor of the frontal sinus, a portion of the lacrimal bone, and the bone over the anterior ethmoid cells. Another important difference is the use of soft, nonreactive material (thin Silastic sheeting) to stent the nasal-frontal passageway. Removal of all the mucosa of the frontal-ethmoid-sphenoid complex is unnecessary for a good postoperative result, and the remaining normal mucosa hastens the process of reepithelialization of the nasal-frontal duct. The patients in our original study group have been observed for a period of 5 to 20 years (mean, 13.5 years) after the surgical procedure. This is the longest period of follow-up for any group of patients reported in the literature. The incidence of failures increased from 7% (one duct) to 20% (3 of 15 ducts) after an additional 7 years of follow-up.\r"

A larynx bypass device was used to determine whether this olfactory deficit could be reversed simply by restoring nasal airflow. Odorant detection thresholds and confusion matrix identification tests were administered to laryngectomy and normal comparison groups. Data on nasal airflow characteristics with and without the bypass were also analyzed. The results suggested that restoration of nasal airflow completely reversed the hyposmia for trigeminal nerve stimuli. However, the reversal of hyposmia was not complete for those odorants which primarily, if not exclusively, stimulate the olfactory nerve. This suggested that other factors may contribute to laryngectomy-induced hyposmia for olfatory nerve stimuli. Additionally, nasal airflow analysis revealed that confusion matrix identification scores were depedent upon inspiratory sniff flow rates with and without the larynx bypass. It is argued that rehabilitation for the laryngectomee should include efforts to restore and maintain preoperative olfactory acuity.\r"

A 25-year-old woman developed a mass on the palate which noted to enlarge during the first trimester of pregnancy. Biopsy revealed a cellular tumor initially considered to be of epithelial origin. Vascular differentiation of the tumor was confirmed, however, by positive lectin histochemistry for Ulex europaeus, by evidence of immunoreactivity for factor VIII-related antigen, and by ultrastructural identification of endothelial features. The patient remains free of tumor 21 months after complete excision. Because of the potential for misdiagnosis, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of oropharyngeal malignancies. The effect of pregnancy on the development and growth of vascular tumors such as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma remains uncertain.\r"

In our series of 31 patients, it was found that severe conductive hearing loss, abundant pale granulations, and denuded malleus handle are constant findings and, in our opinion, are significant clinical features of the pathology. The disease can also manifest itself as an acute mastoiditis. As regards to investigations, bacteriology is considered as being unreliable. This is attributed to secondary organisms interfering with the growth of the tubercle bacillus, as well as the fastidious nature of the bacillus itself. We regard histology as the most reliable means of attaining a definitive diagnosis. Treatment was with a four drug antituberculous regime administered over 6 months. Streptomycin was excluded in all but one case due to its ototoxicity. We believe TB otitis media to be secondary to an established chronic otitis media in the majority of cases.\r"

Despite continued efforts to eliminate this problem, it remains a persistent risk. In reviewing 775 consecutive cases of tonsillectomy, immediate postoperative bleeding occurred in 21 (2.7%). Diagnostic, demographic, hematologic, hemodynamic and surgical management factors were evaluated. The role of local anesthesia for tonsillectomy was also examined. Postoperative bleeders were more likely to have abnormal preoperative clotting studies, greater elevations of their mean postoperative blood pressures, and unusual surgical indications. Local anesthetic cases were shorter, had less intraoperative bleeding and were not associated with greater postoperative bleeding. We conclude that local anesthesia is safe and efficient and that identifiable factors are associated with primary post-tonsillectomy bleeding. An awareness of these factors can help identify potential postoperative bleeders.\r"

Used as an adjunct to surgery on vascular nasal tumors, embolization reduced intraoperative blood loss in four patients to an average of 800 cc. In four patients with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, treatment with embolization did not significantly alter the course of their disease. Overall, however, this relatively new technique enhances successful management of difficult epistaxis cases.\r"

Advantages of the the laser include hemostasis, better view of the tissues, thin layer-by-layer removal of the hyperplastic sebaceous glands, and careful shaping of the resection edges. Disadvantages include risk of facial burns and overabundant removal of tissue with cartilage exposure. We present a case of rhinophyma excision using the CO2 laser and the complication of excessive vaporization of the sebaceous tissue.

  ".W": "Nineteen patients with juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) were surgically treated with different techniques from January 1968 through December 1985. Two patients had undergone a previous operation at another hospital; all patients were males (mean age 15.4), and the most common symptom was nasal obstruction (84.2%). Lateral extension into the pterygomaxillary fossa occurred in 14 patients (73.6%), and 2 also had intracranial invasion (10.5%). In five cases, the tumor's cytosol was analyzed for hormonal receptors. Negative values for estrogen and progesterone receptors were obtained, although the content of dehydrotestosterone receptors was highly positive. These results tend to support the hypothesis of JNA's androgen-dependence. The authors emphasize the need of a preoperative staging classification based on clinicoradiological data in selecting the most adequate surgical approach. Tumors with lateral extension into the pterygomaxillary fossa can be easily removed through a midface degloving; large involvement of the infratemporal fossa requires, also, a transzygomatic dissection. In JNAs with intracranial extension a combined intracranial-extracranial approach is advisable.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six patients with chemodectomas were treated with radiation therapy from 1961 to 1983 and followed for at least 4 years. In 16 glomus tympanicum lesions treated primarily with radiation, long-term control was achieved in all (follow-up 4-24 years, mean 10.5). Fifteen of 16 had no clinical evidence of disease at time of death or last follow-up, and one patient had recurrent but stable disease at 10 years and died of an unrelated illness 19 years after treatment. Eight of the glomus tympanicum lesions were referred for radiation therapy with persistent disease after multiple surgical procedures. Two had extensive skull and intracranial involvement at the time of radiation. Six patients with glomus jugulare lesions were treated with radiation. Four achieved long-term control, and two died of their disease. In addition, two glomus vagal and one carotid body tumor were treated with palliative intent. One glomus tympanicum lesion was treated with preoperative radiation and resection. Chemodectoma was the cause of death in 4 of 25 patients--3 from intracranial extension and 1 from lung and mediastinal metastases. All four patients were referred for radiation with metastases or extensive bone involvement at the skull base. Radiation appears to be effective in achieving long-term clinical control of chemodectomas. Adequately treated volume should be determined with arteriography and/or contrast-enhanced computer tomography, allowing for geometric margins. Doses in the range of 4,500 to 5,000 cGy delivered in about 5 weeks are recommended.\r"

When dural integrity is compromised in the face of nasopharyngeal or paranasal communication, the risk of ascending infection and potential life-threatening meningitis mandate cranial and facial compartments, separated by sufficient and healthy soft tissues. This paper describes a method of providing pedicled soft tissue coverage and support for the contents of the anterior cranial fossa using a temporalis muscle-galea rotation flap. The vascularized myofascial tissues, capable of carrying skin and bone grafts, are well suited to cover and protect large areas of the skull base. Several cases are described to show the advantages and disadvantages of the technique.\r"

Most (23 of 38 cases) originated over the hard palate. The most common histological type was adenoid cystic carcinoma (22 cases). Twenty-five patients were treated with surgery alone, of whom, three had wide local excision. Thirteen patients received postoperative radiation therapy in addition to surgery. The local control was comparable for surgery alone and combined therapy (88% and 85%, respectively) although the combined therapy group was biased by more advanced disease, inadequate margins, and/or poorly differentiated histologies. Mucoepidermoid lesions had an excellent prognosis with local control of 100%. In contrast, there was a 23% recurrence rate for adenoid cystic carcinoma. Regional neck node metastasis was noted in 2% of the patients. This experience indicates that radical resection of palate salivary gland malignancy with adequate margins results in excellent local control. Adjuvant radiation therapy is recommended in cases where there is a question of adequate margins and in advanced lesions of high grade tumors.\r"

We conducted a collaborative study to evaluate the efficacy of this form of therapy in treating superficial transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder. Thirty-seven patients were evaluated and 20 were selected for treatment. A total of 50 papillary tumors and 3 areas of carcinoma in situ were treated. All except two tumors were smaller than 2.5 cm. Assessments for treatment response and toxicity were carried out three months after treatment. The initial diagnosis of one patient was revised after the biopsy material was reviewed, and this patient was not included in the analysis. Complete eradication of all tumors was observed in 9 of 19 patients (47 percent), including those with carcinoma in situ. In the remaining 10 of these 19 patients, 13 tumors could not be eradicated (the overall eradication rate was 37 of 50 tumors [74 percent]), but 9 of the 10 patients had a reduction in tumor size, number, or both of 50 percent or more. We conclude that photodynamic therapy is useful in the treatment of superficial transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder, but controlled trials will be required to define its place in the treatment of cancer.\r"

Of 135 patients with drug-related acute hepatitis B, 81 percent were parenteral drug abusers and 19 percent had sexual contact with drug abusers; 13 fulminant cases resulted in 11 deaths. Among the patients with hepatitis B, evidence of delta virus infection was found in 54 percent of drug abusers, 33 percent of their sexual contacts, and 9 percent of other patients with acute hepatitis B (P less than 0.001). Most of the delta infections (86 percent) were coinfections with hepatitis B virus; the balance were superinfections. Delta infection was strongly associated with fulminant hepatitis: 91 percent of patients with a fulminant outcome had delta infection, as compared with 45 percent of less severely ill drug abusers and their contacts (P = 0.0037). Alcohol, other drugs, and other hepatitis viruses could not be implicated as hepatotoxic cofactors for fulminant disease. This outbreak appeared to result from the concurrent spread of hepatitis B and delta viruses among new drug users. Control measures included the distribution to physicians of guidelines on prophylaxis in contacts of patients with hepatitis B, health education for drug abusers, and a hepatitis B vaccination program. Despite these efforts, the outbreak continued unabated until the number of new cases began to decline slowly in late 1986.\r"

We conclude that both drunk drivers and the population at large are poorly served by current medical and legal practices. Because denial of reality and prevarication are hallmarks of alcoholism, we make two recommendations. First, in order to encourage physicians to refer all injured patients with high blood alcohol concentrations to detoxification and rehabilitation programs, injury to intoxicated drivers should be made a reportable condition. Second, prosecution for driving under the influence of alcohol should be made easier by simplifying the procedures for providing the courts with blood alcohol measurements obtained as part of normal clinical care. Physicians must act in the interest of their patients. The two recommended changes in current practice would help provide a firm framework within which physicians could advise patients about appropriate treatment for alcoholism. If such steps are not taken or are ineffective, vigorous legal action should be encouraged, because society has the right to demand that innocent people not be endangered by intoxicated people who drive motor vehicles.\r"

The distribution of surnames can supply quantitative information on the structure of human populations. Surnames considered as alleles of a gene transmitted only by the male line can be assumed to be neutral markers and therefore satisfy the expectations of the neutral theory of evolution, which is entirely described by random genetic drift, mutation and migration. As data on surnames are easier to collect than those from genes, the information yield is potentially increased, but the validity of the conclusions must be tested in actual samples. The purpose of this report is to compare the estimates of migration rates in Italy, as inferred by the surname distribution found in the telephone directories and other sources, with the corresponding estimates from official demographic sources. Our findings show that in these samples the ratio of surnames to individuals makes it possible to calculate reliable estimates of migration rates.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical activity in non-neuronal cells can be induced by altering the membrane potential and eliciting action potentials. For example, hormones, nutrients and neurotransmitters act on excitable endocrine cells. In an attempt to correlate such electrical activity with regulation of cell activation, we report here direct measurements of cytosolic free Ca2+ changes coincident with action potentials. This was achieved by the powerful and novel combination of two complex techniques, the patch clamp and microfluorimetry using fura 2 methodology. Changes in intracellular calcium concentration were monitored in single cells of the pituitary line GH3B6. We show that a single action potential leads to a marked transient increase in cytosolic free calcium. The size of these short-lived maxima is sufficient to evoke secretory activity. The striking kinetic features of these transients enabled us to identify oscillations in intracellular calcium concentration in unperturbed cells resulting from spontaneous action potentials, and hence provide an explanation for basal secretory activity. Somatostatin, an inhibitor of pituitary function, abolishes the spontaneous spiking of free cytosolic Ca2+ which may explain its inhibitory effect on basal prolactin secretion. Our data therefore demonstrate that electrical activity can stimulate Ca2+-dependent functions in excitable non-neuronal cells.\r"

In the hippocampus excitatory synaptic strength is persistently enhanced after tetanic stimulation. Here we report that latent synaptic pathways may also become functional. Simultaneous intracellular recordings were made from pairs of CA3 pyramidal cells in slices from guinea pig hippocampus. After stimulating afferent fibres repetitively, polysynaptic excitatory pathways between previously unconnected cells became apparent. The efficacy of recurrent inhibitory circuits was also reduced. The loss of inhibitory control is of interest because latent excitatory pathways are revealed after pharmacological suppression of inhibition. This plasticity in local synaptic circuits leads to the emergence of synchronous firing in groups of CA3 cells. The formation of groups of associated cells and the ability of some cells to initiate synchronous firing in a larger cell group through recurrent pathways is reminiscent of several models of information storage and recall in the cortex.\r"

  ".W": "In the feline visual system, neurons exhibiting sensitivity to the length of a moving contour were first observed in the cortex and described as 'hypercomplex cells'. In these cells an increase in stimulus length beyond an optimal value leads to a rapid decline in response. This decline has been attributed to an intracortical inhibitory input which may be driven by layer VI cells with very long receptive fields. It is now clear, however, that cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), exhibit a degree of length tuning similar to that of cortical 'hypercomplex cells', suggesting that this response property could be generated subcortically. Alternatively, as the dLGN receives a massive corticofugal projection from layer VI cells in the visual cortex, it is possible that this input has a function in generating length tuning in the dLGN. We have investigated this issue by comparing the length tuning of dLGN cells with and without corticofugal feedback. The data show that corticofugal feedback makes a highly significant contribution to the length tuning of dLGN cells. This raises the possibility that length tuning is an emergent property of the geniculo-cortical loop.\r"

Here we define a palindromic sequence of 15 base pairs, modelled after a sequence element shared by the vitellogenin genes of frog and chicken, which confers oestrogen inducibility on a heterologous promoter and can be converted into a glucocorticoid-responsive element by substitution of one or two bases at homologous positions in the palindrome. Considered with the observation that the DNA-binding domains of steroid receptors are closely related, this finding demonstrates that the steroid-responsive elements constitute a family of related DNA sequences.\r"

The total release of radioactivity is estimated to be out of the order of 1-2 x 10(18) Bq (3-5 x 10(7) Ci) not allowing for releases of the xenon and krypton gases. The 137Cs releases of 3.8 x 10(16) Bq from Chernobyl can be compared to 1.3 x 10(18) Bq 137Cs released due to atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. Chernobyl-derived radionuclides can be used as transient tracers to study physical and biogeochemical processes. Initial measurements of fallout Chernobyl radionuclides from a time-series sediment trap at 1,071 m during June-September 1986 in the southern Black Sea are presented. The specific activities of 137Cs, 144Ce and 106Ru in the trap samples (0.5-2, 4-12 and 6-13 Bq g-1) are independent of the particle flux while their relative activities reflect their rates of scavenging in the order Ce greater than Ru greater than Cs.\r"

Levels of deposited activity varied by a factor of 30 or more over distances less than 100 km because of variability of rainfall. A sediment trap deployed 222-m-deep in the North Sea off Bergen recorded the onset and magnitude of the deposition of Chernobyl nuclides. The trap collected 13 samples between 24 April and 21 September 1986. The flux of nuclides adsorbed to particles sinking from surface waters to sediments started less than ten days after contaminated air reached the site. Maximum specific activity occurred on 16-27 May for 137Cs, 134Cs, 106Ru and 103Ru, and on 8-20 June for 144Ce, 95Nb and 95Zr. The highest activity was found for 103Ru.

Here we report that an intact ring is not essential for binding of antagonistic AVP analogues to vasopressor (V1) or antidiuretic (V2) AVP receptors. In fact, one acyclic AVP analogue seems to be about as potent as any previously reported cyclic V2 antagonist. This finding suggests new possibilities for the design of AVP analogues as pharmacological probes and for therapeutic use. Similar modifications might be useful in the design of analogues of other cyclic peptides, such as calcitonin, somatostatin and the atrial natriuretic factors.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of alpha-thrombin in the clotting cascade is well-known, but it is also a potent mitogen. Like many other mitogens, thrombin causes receptor-mediated activation of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC), leading to the release of diacylglycerol and the subsequent activation of protein kinase C (refs 3-6). Protein kinase C is probably important in cell proliferation, as activation of this enzyme by phorbol esters promotes growth in many systems. Some growth factors have tyrosine kinase activity and function without activation of PLC or protein kinase C. In this report we show that alpha-thrombin retains its mitogenicity in vascular smooth muscle cells depleted of protein kinase C. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) is found to be a potent growth inhibitor when added to vascular smooth muscle cells with alpha-thrombin. Moreover, growth inhibition is maximal when protein kinase C is activated 4 hours after exposure to thrombin, long after the completion of 'early events' induced by thrombin. Thus, PMA probes an event late in the G1 phase of the cell cycle or at the G1-S transition.\r"

This functional loss of a tRNA with specificity for one group of leucine codons (CUN, where N is any base) was accompanied by the gain of a new tRNA with that specificity. The new tRNA gene for CUN codons appears to have evolved by duplication and divergence from a tRNA gene specific for another group of leucine codons (UUR, where R is a purine). These proposals account for (1) the strong sequence resemblance between the modern tRNA genes for CUN and UUR codons in Paracentrotus, (2) the altered location of the CUN gene in mitochondrial DNA of this urchin, and (3) the persistence of a 72-base pair sequence containing a trace of the old CUN gene at its original location. The old CUN gene now codes for an extra 24 amino acids at the amino end of subunit 5 in NADH dehydrogenase. Besides giving clues about the mechanisms by which tRNA genes move during mitochondrial DNA evolution, this finding leads us to propose a pathway relating the arrangements of other genes in mitochondrial DNAs from four animal phyla.\r"

  ".W": "There have been numerous reports of pathological conditions in the hominid fossils, but these have only involved trauma or age-related deterioration in the health of otherwise normal individuals. Here we describe a skeleton of a young male from Riparo del Romito in Calabria, dated to the Epi-Gravettian of southern Italy. The preserved skeletal elements show that this individual (Romito 2) had the skull and long-bone morphology consistent with a mesomelic form of dwarfism, most probably the autosomal recessive disorder acromesomelic dysplasia. Generally recognized at birth, persons with acromesomelic dysplasia usually have normal intelligence and are free of serious medical problems. However, growth deficiency is severe (adult height typically is 110-120 cm) and mobility at the elbows is restricted. These physical impairments would have greatly interfered with the individual's participation in subsistence activities and would have been a substantial handicap in a nomadic hunting and gathering group. Thus, besides being the earliest known case of dwarfism in the human record, this skeleton provides evidence of tolerance of, and care for, a severely deformed individual in the Palaeolithic.\r"
