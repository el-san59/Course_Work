  ".W": "A protein kinase C inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), inhibited phorbol ester (12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate)-induced and Fc gamma receptor-mediated superoxide anion (O2-) generations in guinea pig macrophages, but the inhibitory effect on Fc gamma receptor-mediated O2- generation was only partial. Both O2- generations were inhibited extensively by a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, 4-p-bromophenacyl bromide (4-pBPB). It was confirmed in control experiments that H-7 and 4-pBPB had no direct inhibitory effect on NADPH-oxidase activity. Dose-dependent stimulation of O2- generation was induced by arachidonate in macrophages, and the arachidonate-induced O2- generation was not inhibited by H-7. Arachidonate could also induce NADPH-oxidase activation in a post-nuclear fraction obtained from unstimulated macrophages and this activation was not inhibited by H-7, indicating that protein kinase C activation was not involved in this cellfree system. These results support the hypothesis that the O2- generation induced by Fc gamma receptor stimulation is mainly mediated by arachidonic acid which is released by the action of phospholipase A2 activated by receptor stimulation. Arachidonic acid seems to be acting rather directly in activating the NADPH-oxidase system of macrophage membrane. Protein kinase C may have a significant role in Fc gamma receptor-mediated O2- generation but it is not obligatory, and protein kinase C seems to activate NADPH-oxidase rather indirectly, probably by inducing the arachidonic acid release.\r"

  ".U": "87224106\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that serotonin (5-HT) suppresses interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced Ia expression. In the present report, we show that 5-HT as well as other monoamines, histamine and dopamine, modulate IFN-gamma-induced phagocytosis in murine bone marrow macrophages. The effect of 5-HT on IFN-gamma-induced phagocytosis varied according to the concentration of IFN-gamma to which the macrophages were exposed. At low concentrations of IFN-gamma, 5-HT augmented phagocytosis, whereas at high concentrations of IFN-gamma, 5-HT suppressed phagocytosis. At both low and high IFN-gamma concentrations the response to 5-HT was dose-related and occurred at physiologic concentrations; the half-maximal effect was 6 X 10(-7) M and 3 X 10(-7) M for low and high IFN-gamma concentrations, respectively. Both histamine and dopamine also augmented IFN-gamma (1 U/ml) induced phagocytosis, at half-maximal augmenting concentrations of 7 X 10(-8) M and 4 X 10(-7) M, respectively. The 5-HT effects were blocked by the 5-HT antagonists spiperone, ketanserin, LY53857, mCPP, and PAPP, but not by the histamine antagonists pyrilamine, chlorpheniramine, or cimetidine. Histamine augmentation of IFN-gamma-induced phagocytosis was blocked by the H1 antagonists pyrilamine and chlorpheniramine, but not by the H2 antagonist cimetidine. The dopamine effect was blocked by spiperone and pyrilamine, both of which have been shown to block dopaminergic effects in other systems. This data provides functional evidence that at least part of the modulation of IFN-gamma-induced phagocytosis by 5-HT occurs through a 5-HT receptor-mediated mechanism, and 5-HT, dopamine, and histamine modulate IFN-gamma-induced phagocytosis independently through their respective receptors.\r"

  ".U": "87224107\r", 
  ".W": "During adhesion and spreading to immobilized immune complexes, casein-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages produced superoxide anion. This production was time-dependent, ceased after a couple of hours, and was due to interaction with immunoglobulins G (IgG) because neither immobilized antigen alone nor immunoglobulins M with or without complement-derived fragments were efficient stimuli. Cultivation of macrophages on immobilized IgG for 24 hr caused desensitization of the response to an unrelated stimulus like zymosan. Desensitization was due neither to inhibition of binding and uptake of zymosan nor to alterations of NADPH oxidase. In fact, macrophages cultivated on immobilized IgG bound and internalized zymosan and responded to PMA with production of superoxide anion normally. Desensitization was not specific for casein-elicited macrophages because both resident peritoneal and Corynebacterium parvum-activated macrophages underwent desensitization if cultivated for 24 hr on immobilized immune complexes. Desensitization on immobilized IgG was maximal after 24 hr, lasted up to 3 days in culture, and was reversed by detaching macrophages from the IgG surface and further cultivating them in normal tissue culture plastic. Scavengers of products of the oxygen metabolism such as superoxide dismutase and catalase and inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism such as indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid did not prevent desensitization. In addition, the zymosan-stimulated release of arachidonic acid was suppressed after cultivation on immobilized IgG for 24 hr; also in this case, the response to PMA was conserved. Contrary to cultivation on immobilized IgG, cultivation of macrophages on fragments derived from C3 was not accompanied by desensitization of the response to zymosan. These results indicate that although the interaction of Fc receptors with their ligands does not impair binding and uptake of zymosan, alterations in the sequence of signals which leads to the activation of the oxygen metabolism can occur, causing a complete dissociation between phagocytosis and stimulation of the oxygen metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "87224108\r", 
  ".W": "It is well established that formyl peptide chemoattractants can activate a phospholipase C in leukocytes via a pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory (G) protein. Whether this pathway is similarly used by chemoattractant receptors as a class has been unclear. We now report that lipid and peptide chemoattractants in direct comparative studies induced similar amounts of initial (less than or equal to 15 sec) inositol trisphosphate (IP3) release in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but the response to lipid chemoattractants was more transient. Production of IP3 by all chemotactic factors was inhibited by treatment of the cells with PT, indicating that chemotactic factor receptors as a class are coupled to phospholipase C via a G protein that is a substrate for ADP ribosylation by PT. The peptide and lipid factors had comparable chemotactic activity, which was also inhibitable by PT. However, transient activation of phospholipase C is apparently an insufficient signal for full cellular activation, since the lipid chemotactic factor leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor were poor stimuli for O2- production and lysosomal enzyme secretion compared with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe). Nonetheless, treatment with PT inhibited O2- production and enzyme secretion in response to all chemoattractants, but as previously noted, did not affect Ca2+ ionophores, lectins, or phorbol myristate acetate. Formyl peptide and lipid chemotactic factors induced similar levels of Ca2+ mobilization when monitored by Quin 2 or chlortetracycline (CTC) fluorescence. Although these responses to fMet-Leu-Phe were blocked by PT, the Quin 2 and initial CTC response to the lipid factors were only partially susceptible. Thus, the lipid factors apparently utilize an additional PT-resistant mechanism for redistributing intracellular Ca2+. This latter process requires extracellular Ca2+ and may be independent of the PT-sensitive G protein.\r"

An IgG monoclonal antibody to these polysialic acid capsules was used for the study of the presence of structurally similar components in tissue glycoproteins to investigate the reasons for the poor immunogenicity and to evaluate potential dangers in active or passive immunization. By immunoblotting polysialic acid was detected outside the brain in newborn rat kidney, heart, and muscle. It appeared in immunoblots as one component and with similar mobility to the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM. Specificity studies of the antibody and endosialidase treatment showed that the polysialic acid glycans detected were composed of chains as long as eight sialic acid residues or more. The polysialic acid was not detected in the corresponding tissues of the adult animal. These results indicate that polysialic acid units are developmentally regulated components of both neural and extraneural tissues, and are bound to components with properties similar to a known cell-adhesion molecule. This together with the presence of low amounts of polysialic acid even in the adult brain, suggests potential hazards in vaccination trials and suggested immunotherapy of meningitis caused by group B meningococci or E. coli K1, which should be carefully assessed.\r"

Mycobacterial growth was assessed by the uptake of 3H-uracil or by determination of colony-forming units. Stimulation of macrophages with recombinant interferon-gamma (r-IFN-gamma) or with IFN-gamma-containing supernatants from antigen- or mitogen-stimulated T cells markedly reduced growth of M. bovis strain BCG Phipps or M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv. In contrast, M. tuberculosis strain Middelburg proved resistant to lymphokine-stimulated macrophages, suggesting heterogeneous susceptibility toward lymphokine-activated macrophages among different M. tuberculosis strains. Stimulation could be blocked by anti-IFN-gamma antiserum, indicating that IFN-gamma was capable of activating antimycobacterial macrophage functions. Stimulation with r-IFN-gamma and subsequent phagocytosis of M. bovis did not lead to increased chemiluminescence responses by bone marrow macrophages, suggesting that mycobacterial growth inhibition was not paralleled by the release of reactive oxygen metabolites. We conclude that IFN-gamma-mediated macrophage activation represents a major step in acquired resistance against tuberculosis and that evasion from this mechanism contributes to mycobacterial virulence.\r"

At the time corresponding to the maximum development of EEF (44 hr after injection of sporozoites), the livers of the IFN-gamma-treated rats contained less parasite DNA as compared with controls. Twenty-four to 72 hr later, the livers of both groups of animals were free of parasites; that is, IFN-gamma treatment does not delay the development of the EEF. The decrease in parasite DNA observed in the IFN-gamma-treated rats was due to a diminution in the number, but not the size, of EEF. It appears, therefore, that treatment with the lymphokine either destroys the parasites or does not affect their replication. To study the mechanism of resistance to IFN-gamma of a small population of EEF, we subjected the parasites to four cycles of selection by IFN-gamma. The parasites from the \"selected\" and \"nonselected\" populations were equally susceptible to inhibition by IFN-gamma, indicating that the escape from IFN-gamma activity is not inherited.\r"

Sequence comparisons of the promoter regions of other VH gene segments indicate that the octamer promoter sequence is part of a larger conserved sequence that may play an important role in immunoglobulin gene transcription.

Five different VH germ-line genes belonging to three major VH families were used. The VH genes were further modified by junctional diversity and differential J usage and possibly by somatic mutations. The effects of these modifications on the fine specificities of anti-alpha(1----6)dextrans are discussed.

  ".U": "87224130\r", 
  ".W": "Two immunogenic, syngeneic murine tumors were used to analyze the immunopathological processes associated with the immune rejection of primary intraocular tumors. Intracameral inoculation of P91 mastocytoma, an immunogenic variant of P815 mastocytoma, into DBA/2 mice resulted in progressive tumor growth for several weeks before immune rejection eradicated the intraocular neoplasm. The histopathologic characteristics of the tumor rejection included: a) destruction of the vascular endothelium of the microvasculature feeding the tumor; b) ischemic bulk necrosis; c) extensive innocent bystander damage to normal ocular structures; and d) absence of direct inflammatory cell-to-tumor cell contact. Thus, the immunopathological features resembled a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) lesion. A second intraocular tumor model was similarly studied. UV5C25 fibrosarcoma grew slowly in the eyes of syngeneic BALB/c hosts. In sharp contrast to P91 tumors, a mononuclear cellular infiltrate was prominent within the tumor. After 5 wk, the intraocular tumors were completely rejected without detectable damage to normal ocular structures. The rejection of UV5C25 tumors did not produce scar tissue, damage to vascular endothelium, bulk necrosis, or atrophy of the globe. Although tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and DTH responses were readily detected, there was no histological evidence for DTH-mediated tumor rejection. Moreover, in situ immunoperoxidase staining indicated that the majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes were CTL, based on their characteristic phenotype: Thy-1+, Lyt-2+. Furthermore, the growth of UV5C25 fibrosarcoma in athymic, natural killer (NK) cell competent BALB/c nude mice demonstrated progressive tumor growth without infiltrating host cells. Collectively, the results indicate that immunogenic intraocular tumors can undergo strikingly different patterns of immune rejection with profoundly different pathological consequences. In one case (P91), tumor rejection occurs by a process that strongly resembles DTH and produces extensive nonspecific damage to normal tissues, resulting in irrevocable loss of vision. In contrast, the second intraocular tumor undergoes an immune rejection that is characterized by precision and a notable absence of damage to normal ocular tissues. The weight of evidence presented here strongly supports the hypothesis that the latter form of tumor rejection is mediated by CTL. Thus, the immunologic pathway invoked for tumor rejection in the eye has a profound effect on the fate of this delicate organ and the preservation of vision.\r"

  ".U": "87224131\r", 
  ".W": "Spontaneously arising reticulum cell sarcoma (RCS) tumors in SJL/J mice stimulate syngeneic host T lymphocytes to proliferate and are dependent on host T cells for maintenance and growth. Tumor-associated Ia antigens have been implicated in the proliferative response both in vivo and in vitro, and the responding T cells are predominantly Lyt-1+2- L3T4+. We hypothesized that elimination or depletion of the responding L3T4 subpopulation in vivo should inhibit growth of transplantable RCS tumors, and continued RCS growth may be dependent on the continued presence of L3T4 cells. This hypothesis was tested experimentally by examining the effect of passive administration of L3T4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) into SJL/J mice either before or at different times after tumor inoculation. The tumor inoculum used killed all mice 15 to 30 days after injection. Administration of a single dose of L3T4 mAb 4 days before tumor inoculation resulted in complete depletion of L3T4 cells and complete inhibition of tumor growth. The antibody-treated mice survived with no sign of tumor growth even after complete recovery of L3T4+ cells. These results demonstrate that initiation of tumor growth is dependent on host L3T4+ cells. Administration of mAb as late as 7 days after tumor inoculation resulted in inhibition of tumor growth, and administration of mAb at day 10 resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth. Compared with the kinetics of tumor growth in normal control mice, administration of L3T4 after tumor inoculation results in tumor growth arrest. These findings demonstrate that continued tumor growth in vivo is dependent on the presence of L3T4+ cells. In the RCS system, the present studies show that administration of mAb to L3T4+ cells is therapeutic in that it inhibits the induction of tumor growth, and it also prevents tumor growth in tumor-bearing animals.\r"

This immune response is mediated by Lyt-1+, Lyt-2,3+ T lymphocytes, with no apparent involvement of cytotoxic T cells, as shown in Winn-type assays. Immune cells mediating tumor rejection in this system have now been further characterized, and it was found that L3T4+ T lymphocytes alone provided full protection against v-src-induced sarcomas. Moreover, the role of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the tumor rejection was analyzed. A monoclonal antibody directed against this lymphokine was able to reverse the protective effect displayed by immune T lymphocytes, by eliciting highly effective T suppressor cells. It was thus concluded that T cells with L3T4 surface marker are the main thing responsible for the adoptive immunity in this tumor system, and the activity of these cells is positively modulated by lymphokines such as IFN-gamma.\r"

Evidence is presented that IL 2 down-regulates T helper cell (Thc) activation but not Thc effector function, i.e., Thc-B cooperation. Thus, reagents which block the IL 2 pathway, e.g., cyclosporin A (CsA) or IL 2 receptor monoclonal antibodies (IL 2R Mab) enhanced Thc activation although T cell proliferation was blocked. In contrast, CsA or IL 2R Mab blocked Thc-B cooperation, suggesting that IL 2 is required for this step. The regulatory role of IL 2 was reconfirmed by the addition of exogenous IL 2 into the cultures which reversed the enhancing or blocking effect of CsA.\r"

However, although proliferation of CTL increased and reached plateau levels as concentrations of anti-TCR mAb were increased, the proliferation of HTL decreased with high concentrations of anti-TCR mAb. A reduction of IL 2-dependent proliferation by CTL was observed when IL 2 was added to cultures of CTL in the presence of high concentrations of anti-TCR mAb, whereas IL 2-independent proliferation appeared to be unaffected by these concentrations of anti-TCR mAb. Inhibition of IL 2-driven proliferation caused by high concentrations of immobilized anti-TCR mAb did not seem to be mediated by soluble factors. Cells continued to express cell surface receptors for IL 2 and transferrin after treatment with immobilized anti-TCR mAb. Inhibition of IL 2-driven proliferation by high concentrations of immobilized anti-TCR mAb may represent a mechanism for regulating the proliferation of T lymphocytes. This inhibitory mechanism is initiated by stimulation of the T cell receptor, in this case by immobilized anti-TCR mAb, and is independent of other cells and factors.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages are activated by lymphokines (LK) to kill tumor cell and microbial targets. Interferon-gamma (IFN) is the major LK activity in conventional, antigen or mitogen-stimulated spleen cell culture fluids for induction of these macrophage effector functions. In view of the recent demonstration that murine macrophage-like cell lines have receptors for B cell stimulatory factor-1/interleukin 4 (BSF-1), a possible role for BSF-1 in regulation of macrophage function was considered. In this communication, thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages were shown to express about 2300 high affinity (Ka approximately 2 X 10(10) M-1) BSF-1 receptors/cell. Peritoneal macrophages treated with purified, T cell-derived BSF-1 developed potent tumoricidal activity against fibrosarcoma target cells. The concentration of BSF-1 that induced 50% of maximal tumor cytotoxicity was 38 +/- 4 U/ml for seven experiments; similar dose-responses were observed with recombinant BSF-1. That BSF-1 dose-responses for induction of macrophage-mediated tumor cytotoxicity were not affected by 5 micrograms/ml polymyxin B suggested that contaminant endotoxins played little or no role in cytotoxic activity. BSF-1 alone (less than or equal to 500 U/ml) was not directly toxic to tumor cells or macrophages. Macrophage tumoricidal activity induced by BSF-1 but not by IFN was inhibited greater than or equal to 90% with monoclonal anti-BSF-1 antibody. BSF-1 induced Ia antigen expression on peritoneal macrophages and increased (twofold to threefold) FcR(II)-dependent binding of murine IgG immune complexes to bone marrow-derived macrophages (greater than 98% macrophages). Based on these findings, it was concluded that BSF-1 is a potent macrophage activation factor.\r"

  ".U": "87224144\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies it has been demonstrated that a T cell-like differentiation signal is transmitted by C8-substituted guanine ribonucleosides such as 8-mercaptoguanosine (8MGuo) to antigen-stimulated B cells. A large subset of potentially reactive B cells remains unresponsive to antigen even in the presence of signals provided by these nucleosides except when this signal is preceded by a soluble activity present in mixed lymphocyte culture supernatants. Studies with purified preparations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, B cell stimulatory factor 1 (IL-4), and B cell growth factor II (IL-5) indicated that none of these activities is capable of synergizing with 8MGuo to augment B cell responsiveness to antigen. Therefore, supernatants from a number of cloned cell lines were examined for activity that could synergize with 8MGuo, in order to determine the cellular source of this activity. Soluble products secreted by cloned 24/G1 T cells act synergistically with 8MGuo to evoke enhanced antibody responses to specific antigen in populations of purified B cells. Because concanavalin (Con) A-activated 24/G1 cells produce large quantities of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the possibility that interferons might mediate synergy with 8MGuo was investigated. Purified murine IFN-gamma is unable to interact synergistically with 8MGuo; moreover, treatment of active 24/G1 supernatants with monoclonal anti-IFN-gamma antibodies or at pH 2 fails to abrogate their ability to synergize. In contrast to IFN-gamma, when B cells were supplemented with either IFN-alpha or IFN-beta, antigen-dependent synergy with 8MGuo was observed. However, abrogation of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta activity with specific antibodies fails to interfere with synergy between 8MGuo and mixed lymphocyte culture or Con A supernatants. Therefore, it appears that although IFN-alpha and IFN-beta are not responsible for the synergizing activity present in activated T cell supernatants, they nonetheless represent a previously unrecognized source of synergizing activity.\r"

  ".U": "87224145\r", 
  ".W": "Although the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) receptor on murine and human mononuclear phagocytes has been defined and partially characterized, very little data exists which describes the ultimate fate of receptor-bound ligand. The current studies were specifically designed to define the metabolic processes which act on murine recombinant IFN-gamma following its interaction with murine macrophages at physiologic temperatures. Ligand internalization was demonstrated by comparing binding of [125I]IFN-gamma to macrophages at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C. When binding was carried out at 4 degrees C, 96% of the cell-associated [125I]IFN-gamma remained accessible at the plasma membrane and could be stripped from the cell by exposure to pronase. In contrast, at 37 degrees C, only 35% of the cell-associated radioactivity was pronase strippable. Macrophages degraded [125I]IFN-gamma into trichloroacetic acid-soluble material at 37 degrees C at a constant rate of 7000 molecules/cell/hr over a 12-hr time period. The amount of IFN-gamma degraded correlated with the amount of IFN-gamma bound to the cell surface. The receptor was neither up- nor down-regulated by ligand or by other agents known to regulate macrophage functional activity such as IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, lipopolysaccharide, or phorbol myristate acetate. The constant uptake of IFN-gamma by macrophages was due to the presence of an intracellular receptor pool (62% of the total receptor number) and to a mechanism of receptor recycling. Evidence for the latter was obtained using lysosomotropic agents which blocked degradation but not binding and internalization of ligand and caused the intracellular accumulation of receptor. By comparing the relationship between receptor occupancy and biologic response induction, two activation mechanisms became apparent. Induction of certain functions, such as H2O2 secretion, appeared to require only a single round of receptor occupancy. However, induction of more complex functions such as nonspecific tumoricidal activity appeared to require three to four rounds of receptor occupancy. These results thus support the concept that IFN-gamma internalization and receptor recycling are essential in the induction of nonspecific tumoricidal activity by macrophages.\r"

These results were confirmed in purified (average purity = 89 +/- 3%) basophils (n = 4). Leukotriene C4 release was also reduced to 15 +/- 5% of control (p less than 0.005) when pertussis toxin-treated basophils were exposed to 1.0 microM f-Met peptide, although no inhibition was noted when anti-IgE or A23187 were used as the stimuli. The effect of pertussis toxin on basophils appears to be independent of the presence of contaminating mononuclear cells. We found that pertussis toxin inhibited f-Met peptide-induced histamine release regardless of the magnitude of the stimulus (0.01 microM to 1.0 microM f-Met peptide), although anti-IgE-induced release was unaffected over a dose-response curve. The effect of pertussis toxin was found to be both time- and concentration-dependent. The maximum effects were obtained after a 3-hr incubation with 1 microgram/ml of toxin. Lower (0.01 to 0.05 microgram/ml) concentrations of toxin or shorter (30 to 60 min) incubation periods did not significantly (p greater than 0.05) inhibit mediator release.\r"

They also block rosettes with E from all the species we have tested, including rosettes with autologous E. They define three different minor components on the E surface: MAb N217 precipitates a single 42-kilodalton (kDa) chain and MAb N4 a single 14-kDa chain, and MAb N23 immunoprecipitates under nonreducing conditions a single band at approximately 220 kDa, which is resolved under reducing and alkylating conditions, in two bands migrating at approximately 110 kDa and approximately 220 kDa. Thus MAb N23 is likely to react with a complex made of covalently linked 100-kDa chains associated in a noncovalent fashion with approximately 220 kDa chains. In addition, we have observed a puzzling phenomenon, i.e., that binding the MAb N23 first increases, to a large extent, the amount of N4 epitopes which can be subsequently detected on E. This effect was not observed when N217 MAb or antiglycophorin (either monoclonal or polyclonal) antisera were first bound on E. Therefore the N23 and N4 molecules must interact on the E surface. This finding discloses the complex interactions between the T cell and E surface component that must occur in the process of rosette formation, including that with autologous E. These observations are of interest in view of the recent evidence that the CD2 molecule is involved both in adhesion and activation aspects of T cell functioning.\r"

We found that PZQ was on the average only 20% as effective in eliminating adult schistosomes from mu-suppressed as compared with control animals. Indeed, in three of four experiments performed, the drug failed to significantly reduce adult worm burdens in the mu-suppressed mice. These results were not due to a delay in parasite death in the infected B cell-depleted animals, because adult worms recovered from these mice as late as 7 wk after chemotherapy were indistinguishable in number and appearance from those recovered from non-drug-treated animals. The efficacy of PZQ against schistosomes in mu-suppressed mice was completely restored by passive transfer of immune serum from donor mice infected for 6 wk and partially restored with IgG purified from the same sera. Moreover, IgG as well as IgM antibodies were detected by immunofluorescence on the surface of adult worms recovered from intact mice as early as 1 hr after administration of the drug in vivo. The tubercles of the male worms appeared to be a major site for antibody binding. These results formally demonstrate that the mechanism of action of PZQ, the most important anti-schistosomal compound in current use, involves a synergy between the drug and the humoral immune response of the host, and suggest that the relevant effector antibodies act directly against parasite antigens which become exposed on the surface of the worms as a consequence of interaction with the drug.\r"

A total of 3775 VH nucleotides was analyzed in this way, and only one difference from the germ-line VH sequence was observed. The rate of V gene somatic mutation that has been estimated to occur during antigen-driven immune responses in vivo is 10(-3)/base pair/cell division. Given an estimated value for the number of cell divisions that occurred before hybridoma formation, at least 15 changes from the germ-line VH sequence should have been observed if mutation had been occurring at the in vivo rate during the culture period. Therefore, the data suggest that mitogen-driven B cell proliferation and differentiation are not sufficient to induce the hypermutation of Ig V region genes.\r"

  ".U": "87224161\r", 
  ".W": "The surface expression of class II major histocompatibility molecules (immune associated or Ia antigens) is an acquired property of macrophages, essential to their ability to interact effectively with T lymphocytes. Surface expression of Ia is induced by stimulants such as interferon-gamma and is suppressed by agents such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Recent studies on several cultured cell lines indicate that interferon-gamma can heighten cellular levels of mRNA encoding Ia, and the level of such mRNA may represent an important regulatory focus for controlling expression of surface Ia. Murine peritoneal macrophages were treated with interferon-gamma and/or LPS and expression of Ia mRNA determined by Northern blot analysis with a probe specific for the murine beta-chain of I-A. mRNA specific for I-A beta was not detectable in explanted macrophages obtained from sites of sterile inflammation but was induced by treatment of purified recombinant interferon-gamma. This effect was dose dependent and was optimal by 24 hr after stimulation. Ia-specific mRNA preceded the surface expression of Ia as monitored by a radioimmunoassay using a monoclonal antibody specific for I-A beta. When a physiologic dose of LPS was added concomitantly with the interferon-gamma, the time course of induction if Ia-specific mRNA was not altered, but the amount of such mRNA detected was suppressed 40 to 80%. This effect was dependent on the dose of LPS, and the levels of mRNA correlated closely with subsequent surface expression of Ia. The ability of LPS to suppress both mRNA and cell surface Ia expression required that the suppressive agent be added within 12 hr of the inducing stimulus. This is the time frame during which accumulation of mRNA occurs. Thus the data demonstrates that accumulation of specific mRNA is a major regulatory focus governing expression of Ia both by interferon-gamma and LPS.\r"

This profile is consistent with a Leu-1+ B cell and excludes a T cell, natural killer cell, and monocyte. Comparison of the relative role of these cells to the role of monocytes in the suppression of pokeweed mitogen-stimulated Ig synthesis was determined in serial studies on 19 myeloma patients. The mean (+/- SEM) percentage of inhibition of Ig synthesis by monocytes from stage I myeloma patients was 14 +/- 2.2%, from stage II patients was 37 +/- 3.5%, and from stage III patients was 51 +/- 4.7%.

Coordinate increases in steady-state mRNA for A beta, and E alpha were observed in response to rIFN-gamma. Maximum induction occurred 24 hr post-treatment and required the continued presence of rIFN-gamma. Induction of A alpha-specific mRNA was sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Simultaneous treatment of macrophage cultures with rIFN-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta or the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) resulted in a significant decrease in steady-state, A alpha-specific mRNA levels compared with treatment with rIFN-gamma alone. This analysis suggests that both the induction of Ia expression by rIFN-gamma, and the antagonism of rIFN-gamma-induced Ia gene expression by IFN-alpha/beta and DEX, are regulated by cognate changes in Ia mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "In this study the tumor-specific immuneresponse induced by irradiated tumor cells (L1210/GZL) and by anti-idiotype antibodies was analyzed. The anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2) were made against the paratope of a monoclonal antitumor antibody (11C1) that recognizes a tumor-associated antigen which cross-reacts with the mouse mammary tumor virus-encoded envelope glycoprotein 52. Two Ab2, 2F10 and 3A4, induced idiotypes expressed by the monoclonal antitumor antibodies 11C1 and 2B2. Cytotoxic T cells, generated by immunization with irradiated tumor cells, lyse 2F10 and 3A4 hybridoma cells. Furthermore, immunization with Ab2 induces tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The frequency of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte was found to be similar in mice immunized with Ab2 or irradiated tumor cells when examined at the precursor level. However, only 2F10 induces protective immunity against the growth of L1210/GZL tumor cells. The depletion of a L3T4+ T cell population from 2F10 immune mice was found to increase the effectiveness of transferred T cells to induce inhibition of tumor growth. The inability of 3A4 to induce antitumor immunity could be correlated with the presence of a population of Lyt2+ regulatory T cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate the existence of a regulatory network controlling the expression of effective tumor immunity. Our results demonstrate that selection of binding site-related Ab2 may not be a sufficient criteria for the development of an idiotype vaccine. A better understanding of the regulatory interactions induced by anti-idiotypes is needed for the design of effective antitumor immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The systemic administration of high-dose recombinant IL 2 mediated significant reductions of established 3-day pulmonary micrometastases from both weakly immunogenic and nonimmunogenic sarcomas. However, when treatment with IL 2 was delayed for 10 days after the injection of tumor cells in an attempt to treat grossly visible pulmonary macrometastases, only those established from weakly immunogenic sarcomas remained susceptible. Established 10-day pulmonary nodules from the nonimmunogenic sarcomas became refractory to IL 2 therapy. We utilized selective depletion of lymphocyte subsets in vivo by the systemic administration of specific monoclonal antibodies to cells bearing either the L3T4 or Lyt-2 marker or a heteroantiserum to cells bearing the ASGM-1 glycosphingolipid to identify lymphocytes involved in IL 2-induced tumor regression. Cells with potent lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity against fresh tumor targets in vitro were identified in the lungs of IL 2-treated mice. By flow cytometry analysis, the majority of these effector cells were Thy-1+, L3T4-, Lyt-2-, ASGM-1+. Depletion in vivo of ASGM-1+ cells before the onset of IL 2 administration eliminated the successful therapy of 3-day pulmonary metastases from nonimmunogenic sarcomas, with concurrent elimination of LAK cell activity in the lungs. In mice with 3-day pulmonary metastases from weakly immunogenic sarcomas, both Lyt-2+ cells and ASGM-1+ cells were involved in IL 2-mediated tumor regression, but Lyt-2+ cells appeared to be the more potent mediator in the response. Lyt-2+ cells were also involved in the elimination of grossly visible 10-day macrometastases from these weakly immunogenic tumors. Depletion of L3T4+ cells had no effect on tumor regression. Thus, although LAK effectors derived from ASGM-1+ precursors can eliminate pulmonary micrometastases regardless of tumor immunogenicity, Lyt-2+ cells are predominant effectors in the elimination of both pulmonary micro- and macrometastases from weakly immunogenic sarcomas.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the potential regulatory role of interferon-gamma in the cellular immune response to melanoma and its precursor lesions, we have tested the capacity of this lymphokine to enhance HLA class II antigen-dependent T lymphocyte blastogenesis, its in vitro production by autologous T cells stimulated by melanoma, and its presence in melanocytic lesions in situ. Cell lines derived from a dysplastic nevus, a radial growth phase primary tumor, a vertical growth phase primary, and metastatic lesions were induced by recombinant interferon-gamma to express increased amounts of HLA class II antigens. Such cells were then examined in radioimmunoassay for expression of HLA-DR antigens and in co-culture for their ability to stimulate proliferation of autologous T cells. Interferon-gamma treatment of melanocytic cells increased their expression of HLA-DR antigens threefold to sixfold. In parallel with these findings, co-culture of T cells with interferon-treated cells of a dysplastic nevus and a radial phase melanoma led to augmented T cell incorporation of tritiated thymidine, and this stimulation was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody to HLA-DR antigens. Despite augmented expression of HLA class II antigens (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP), vertical growth phase and metastatic melanoma cells failed to stimulate autologous T cells. When T cells were co-cultured with stimulating melanoma cells, culture supernatants contained significantly increased amounts of interferon-gamma (12 U/ml) in comparison with supernatants of T cells alone (4 U/ml). No interferon was detectable in cultures of melanoma cells alone. To link these in vitro phenomena to in situ events, we used murine monoclonal antibodies to interferon-gamma, the interleukin 2 receptor, and HLA-DR antigens in an immunoperoxidase system to detect interferon production and lymphocyte activation in frozen sections of lesions representative of melanocytic tumor progression. In these studies, precursor dysplastic nevi and radial phase melanomas contained the highest numbers of activated lymphocytes and stained positively for interferon-gamma. These results suggest that interferon-gamma plays a central role in the regulation of the cellular immune response to melanoma. It is produced by T cells, likely activated by tumor antigens seen in the context of HLA class II antigens. In turn, interferon-gamma production enhances expression of HLA class II antigens by melanoma and precursor cells, and such enhancement is associated with additional T cell activation in a positive feed-back loop.\r"

In an in vitro system devoid of CD8 T cells, CD4, Leu-8+ T cells suppressed pokeweed mitogen-induced immunoglobulin synthesis. Similarly, suppressor function was induced in unfractionated CD4 T cell populations after incubation with anti-Leu-8 antibody under cross-linking conditions. This induction of suppressor function by anti-Leu-8 antibody was not due to expansion of the CD4, Leu-8+ T cell population because CD4 T cells did not proliferate in response to anti-Leu-8 antibody. However, CD4, Leu-8+ T cell-mediated suppression was radiosensitive. Finally, CD4, Leu-8+ T cells do not inhibit immunoglobulin synthesis when T cell lymphokines were used in place of helper CD4 T cells (CD4, Leu-8- T cells), suggesting that CD4 T cell-mediated suppression occurs at the T cell level. We conclude that CD4 T cells can be induced to suppress immunoglobulin synthesis by modulation of the membrane antigen recognized by anti-Leu-8 antibody.\r"

Attempts to demonstrate cytotoxic activity were without success unless the LGL were incubated with 100 U of human recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL 2)/ml for 24 hr. With rIL 2 incubation, low effector to target ratios (10:1) consistently yielded high levels of cytotoxic activity (30 to 50%) in a standard 4-hr 51Cr-release assay using YAC-1 lymphoma or K562 erythroleukemia cell lines as targets. Monoclonal antibody EqT12 reacted with a large percentage of these cells, and the level of cytotoxic activity was directly correlated to the percentage of EqT12+ cells in the preparation. In normal horses, the percentage of circulating EqT12+ cells is low (5%), while at the same time, cytotoxic activity is not usually detectable even with rIL 2 incubation. In contrast, the percentage of EqT12+ cells in blood of SCID horses is high (up to 40%), as is the IL 2-inducible cytotoxic activity. These results indicate that cytotoxic cells with morphologic and functional characteristics of natural killer cells are produced by horses with SCID.\r"

Control clones were simultaneously derived from the blood. The proportion of T4+ and T8+ T cell clones from the brain tissue differed from that of peripheral blood T cell clones derived at the same time, suggesting that the clones were not derived from the peripheral blood. None of 57 brain-derived T cell clones proliferated to either MBP or PLP, although they responded well to PHA and IL 2. An additional 235 clones derived from the cerebrospinal fluid and 126 clones from the peripheral blood of other subjects with multiple sclerosis also did not proliferate to MBP or PLP. In contrast, five of nine T4+ clones from the CSF of a subject with postinfectious encephalomyelitis exhibited low but clear reactivity to human MBP, supporting the possible role of MBP as the target antigen in this disease. These studies, the first to clone T cells directly from MS plaque tissue, suggest that the lack of consistent T cell reactivity to MBP or PLP in the peripheral blood of MS patients does not appear to be secondary to the sequestration of a large number of these cells in the brain.\r"

Four weeks later, each mouse was immunized with 100 micrograms fetal bovine type II collagen, and the incidence and severity of arthritis was noted at weekly intervals. AP was measured by competitive ELISA in plasma taken 5 wk and 15 wk after immunization. AP levels were less in fish oil fed males and females. Under all conditions tested AP levels of females were greater than in males. There was a negative correlation between AP levels and the severity of arthritis. We conclude from these data that although AP levels cannot be used as indices of arthritis severity, there are significant dietary and gender effects on AP concentrations as long as 15 wk after immunization with type II collagen.\r"

Liposomes carrying molecules from trinitrophenylated-Pam cells did not stimulate lymphnode cells (LCs) of contact sensitivity; however, liposomes carrying a large amount of those molecules stimulated LCs. This stimulation was attributable to contaminated Ia antigens in those molecules. Liposomes with a small amount of those molecules or trinitrophenylated-proteins from Pam cells were prepared. Into them were inserted Ia antigen-rich proteins from Pam cells, spleen cells, IFN-gamma-treated Pam cells, or epidermal cells containing Langerhans cells. Thus prepared liposomes stimulated the LCs significantly. The Ia antigens obtained from IFN-gamma-treated Pam cells worked as well as Ia antigens from epidermal cells that contained Langerhans cells as the molecule of antigen presentation in contact sensitivity.\r"

Human embryonic lung fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and various concentrations of mupirocin ranging from 0.5-756 micrograms/ml. There is little difference in the rate of exponential growth and the final saturation density reached between control cultures and those grown in 0.5 microgram, 72 micrograms, or 76 micrograms/ml mupirocin. Growth was retarded or inhibited in cultures containing 650-750 micrograms/ml mupirocin. The proliferative lifespan of adult skin fibroblasts was examined in cultures serially subcultivated in medium containing either 7 micrograms/ml or 100 micrograms/ml mupirocin. Cultures incubated in these concentrations of mupirocin were capable of reaching their full proliferative potential. This study shows that the growth and proliferative lifespan of human fibroblasts is unaltered in the presence of at least 100 micrograms/ml mupirocin although growth of human fibroblasts is inhibited by 700 micrograms/ml mupirocin. These observations suggest that long-term use of low but bactericidal concentrations of mupirocin will not impair growth of fibroblasts in healing wounds.\r"

An extremely broad range of contractility (normal, poor, and hypercontraction) was observed in all types of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). When contraction in control fibroblasts was defined as the mean +/- 2 SD, (all control values were within this range) and the data were analyzed by the chi-square test, only 32% of EB cells fell within this range, with 47% poorly contractile and 21% hypercontractile. These data, derived from 34 patients, indicate that no single genetic defect resulting in altered contractility in the 3 distinct types of EB is likely. Neither cell viability, collagenase expression, nor PGE2 synthesis as correlated with gel contraction in any group. Indomethacin had no effect on contraction in RDEB. It is possible that the genetic defects in EB cause blister formation in vivo and may lead in some way to an abnormal interaction of fibroblasts with the extracellular matrix resulting in an altered collagen lattice contraction in vitro.\r"

These results indicate that DNA analysis provides a valuable means for improving the diagnosis of extracutaneous disease in advanced stages of CTCL. In contrast, the gene was in a germline configuration in all samples from 12 patients with plaque stages of mycosis fungoides or suspected early CTCL, suggesting that in these 2 conditions the T-cell proliferation is either polyclonal or contains very few monoclonal (i.e., neoplastic) cells.\r"

We compared the in vivo response of melanocytes to single and multiple exposures of narrow band UVA and UVB irradiation which produced visibly equal increases in pigmentation. Using a xenon-mercury source matched to a monochromator, human volunteers were exposed to 304 (+/- 5) and 365 (+/- 10) nm radiation. Biopsies were performed 1, 7, and 14 days after irradiation. For each biopsy, the number of melanocytes per square millimeter of epidermis was determined using L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa)- and tyrosine-incubated split epidermal preparations. Vertical sections were also examined. At days 7 and 14, after both 304 and 365 nm radiation, melanocytes were more intensely dopa-positive than in unirradiated controls, and demonstrated enlarged perikarya and a greater number of enlarged dendrites. Following both 304 and 365 nm radiation the number of dopa-positive melanocytes was increased at days 7 and 14 by 44% and 58%, respectively. Tyrosine positivity, an indicator of enhanced tyrosinase activity and increased melanin formation, was absent in controls and at day 1, and became positive in all but one sample at day 7 and day 14. Therefore, one day after UVA exposure, visible pigmentation but not tyrosinase activity was increased. At day 7, the number of tyrosine-positive melanocytes approximately equaled the number of dopa-positive melanocytes. Although UVA and UVB induce different pigmentary responses, their effects on melanocyte number and function were indistinguishable.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-eight follicular fluids (FF) were obtained from 18 women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Follicular development was induced by human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and follicular aspiration was performed 36 hr after an ovulatory dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Two stages of oocyte-corona-cumulus complexes (OCCCs) morphological maturation was identified in this population: intermediate and mature. FF from which intermediate and mature OCCCs were obtained did not differ in 17 beta-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), and cholesterol levels. Fifty OCCCs were fertilized and eight were not fertilized. No difference was found in E2, P, and cholesterol levels in those two populations of OCCCs. Forty hours after insemination 50% of the oocytes were at the two-cell stage and 50% were at the three-cell stage. Steroids and cholesterol levels did not differ in FF from which those two groups of embryos originated. A direct correlation was found among the levels of cholesterol, E2, and P in the FF. An inverted ratio of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) was found in FF compared to serum in 10 women. It is concluded that FF cholesterol levels have no value in predicting follicular maturation.\r"

Previous studies have suggested that the combination of clomiphene citrate (CC) and human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) is superior to either CC or hMG alone in terms of follicular development, oocyte recovery, and embryo transfer. However, no significant increase in viable pregnancy rates has been reported with any of the protocols. This report examines five different CC/hMG protocols. While differences were seen in terms of serum estradiol response and fertilization rates of mature oocytes among the various protocols, no significant differences were found in terms of follicular development, oocyte recovery, embryo transfer, or pregnancy. The pregnancy rate in IVF-ET appears unaffected by variations in the dose and timing of CC and hMG in a combination protocol.\r"

After 3 months, plasminogen levels increased in the two experimental groups (LYN-EE and LNG-EE), by 40% and 32%, respectively. This change was positively correlated with changes in ceruloplasmin levels, indicating that an estrogenic effect might be involved. Histidine-rich glycoprotein concentration decreased by 26% and 16%, respectively. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity increased by 260% and 167%; t-PA antigen decreased by 12% and 18%, and t-PA inhibitor activity decreased by 31% and 32%, respectively. In the coagulation system, in both groups factor XII increased by 47% and 34%, respectively. The main inhibitor of factor XII, C1-inactivator, decreased slightly, but this was significant only in the LNG-EE group. The von Willebrand factor antigen fell by 8% and 9%, whereas factor VIII activity did not change. Antithrombin III antigen decreased by 14% in both groups. Factor IX activity increased by 15% and 21%. The difference in hormonal effects of both preparations was reflected by the increases in sex hormone binding globulin (by 130% and 21%) and ceruloplasmin (by 98% and 51%), indicating that LYN-EE had a more estrogenic potency than LNG-EE. In a control group of 25 matched subjects, who were observed simultaneously, we found no significant changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-bacterial interactions were examined in vitro by incubating organisms isolated from patients with septicemia with normal platelet-rich plasma. The potency of various species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to induce irreversible platelet aggregation was then determined in an aggregometer. The aggregation curves produced by the bacteria resembled the normal platelet response to collagen and were impeded by the presence of aspirin. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 25 different patients produced maximum increases in light transmission and irreversible platelet aggregation with relatively rapid mean aggregation times; six of these patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In contrast, isolates of alpha streptococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis induced irreversible platelet aggregation much less commonly and were associated with considerably longer mean aggregation times. None of the latter group of patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Isolates of bacteria from a small number of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis uniformly induced irreversible platelet aggregation. Addition of paired bacterial isolates to normal platelet-rich plasma demonstrated a synergistic aggregation response. These data suggest that a relative hierarchy exists in bacterial strain potency to induce irreversible platelet aggregation. The rapidity and degree of aggregation in vitro correlated well with the clinical and laboratory evidence for subacute bacterial endocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in vivo. These observations may provide useful adjunctive laboratory information to help establish the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the clinical setting where the classical findings of endocarditis are not obvious during initial presentation.\r"

  ".W": "An assay system has been developed that allows consecutive quantification of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity and t-PA antigen in the same plasma sample. In the first step t-PA is bound to an immobilized IgM monoclonal anti-t-PA antibody and functional activity of bound t-PA is quantified by its plasminogen-activating activity. In the second step the amount of bound t-PA antigen is determined by using a different peroxidase-labeled monoclonal anti-t-PA antibody. In this combined assay system t-PA functional activity was found to depend not only on the amount of t-PA antigen but also on the amount of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), whereas in the t-PA antigen assay PAI did not affect the results. In plasma samples obtained from normal controls t-PA activity was detected only in post-venous occlusion plasma (3.7 +/- 2.5 IU/ml), whereas 2.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml t-PA antigen was found before and 12.6 +/- 4.4 ng/ml after venous occlusion. Using this combined assay system to study plasma samples from patients who did not respond to venous occlusion with shortening of the euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT), it was possible not only to confirm that in none of these patients could t-PA activity be detected in the postocclusion plasma samples but also to subdivide that group of patients into a group of about 39% not reacting with normal t-PA antigen release to venous occlusion and into a second group of about 61% that reacted with normal t-PA antigen release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Levels of plasma hANP (199.6 +/- 53.7 pg/ml) and cyclic GMP (12.6 +/- 1.7 pmol/ml) in patients with congestive heart failure were significantly higher than in the control subjects (hANP 57.1 +/- 2.8 pg/ml, cyclic GMP 5.2 +/- 0.3 pmol/ml). Although plasma hANP concentrations in the patients with congestive heart failure tended to increase with the severity of cardiac dysfunction, there was no significant correlation between the levels of plasma hANP and the grade of heart failure, classified according to the New York Heart Association. However, a significant correlation was found between plasma hANP and cyclic GMP concentrations in both the healthy subjects and the patients with congestive heart failure, and a weak positive correlation between plasma hANP and cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) concentration in the patients with congestive heart failure. Thus, changes in plasma cyclic GMP concentration depend to some extent on the plasma concentrations of hANP.\r"

Currently, approximately 16,000 physician assistants are employed by physicians and institutions throughout the country. Established to fill a perceived gap in primary health care delivery in the 1960s, the profession continues to serve mainly in primary care settings, with 43 percent of all physician assistants in family practice clinics. There is a trend, however, for physician assistants to fill health care gaps in other settings, such as long-term care institutions and correctional facilities. The clinical effectiveness of physician assistants has been demonstrated in terms of both quality of care and patient acceptance, and they are adept at adjusting to shifts in the health care marketplace. However, the real determinant of the future of the profession will be economic advantage. Recent changes in Medicare legislation now permit reimbursement for physician assistant services in nursing homes and hospitals, and payment under Medicaid has been approved in one half of the states. Given the cost effectiveness of physician assistants, their demonstrated competence and acceptability, and their adaptability to a variety of settings, the demand for their services is likely to continue.\r"

Using a computerized system that automatically sampled airway flow, pressure, and expired carbon dioxide tension, we were able to distinguish spontaneous ventilatory efforts from mechanical ventilatory efforts. The PETCO2 values varied widely from breath to breath, and the arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide tension gradient was appreciably altered during the course of several hours. About two-thirds of the time, the PETCO2 of spontaneous breaths was greater than that of ventilator breaths during the same 70-second sample period. The most accurate indicator of PaCO2 was the maximal PETCO2 value in each sample period, the correlation coefficient being 0.768 (P less than 0.001) and the arterial to end-tidal gradient being 4.24 +/- 4.42 mm Hg (P less than 0.01 compared with all other measures). When all values from an 8-minute period were averaged, stability was significantly improved without sacrificing accuracy. We conclude that monitoring the maximal PETCO2, independent of breathing pattern, provides a clinically useful indicator of PaCO2 in postcardiotomy patients receiving intermittent mandatory ventilation.\r"

All three Zoladex doses yielded similar endocrinologic effects. After initial transient increases in serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone concentrations, serum testosterone was suppressed uniformly to castration levels within 22 days. At a median follow-up of 41 weeks, Zoladex had maintained persistent suppression of serum testosterone. Measurements of serum Zoladex levels indicated that release of the drug from the injected depot was sustained over a period of 1 month and that there was no drug accumulation as evaluated over an initial 3-month period. No antibodies to Zoladex were detected. Tumor regression rates and side effects with Zoladex therapy were similar to those reported with daily injections of subcutaneous LHRH therapy. Signs and symptoms consistent with a brief tumor flare after the first injection of the LHRH analogue were noted in eight (17%) of the study entrants. Spinal cord compression was observed in two patients within 1 week from the onset of therapy. Zoladex is considered to be an effective, sustained-release LHRH analogue for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer.\r"

Each complex was obtained as mixtures of two isomers, syn and anti, which were separated chromatographically. In biodistribution studies, both isomers of [99mTc]TMPDA showed little uptake in the brain. In contrast, the brain uptake values at 2 and 15 min for [99mTc]DEA-anti were 0.99 and 0.26, whereas, the corresponding values for DEA-syn were 2.27, 0.64% dose/organ, respectively. Autoradiographic studies (in rats) using both isomers of [99mTc]DEA show a fixed regional distribution and a higher concentration of radioactivity in the gray matter relative to the white matter. Planar imaging using [99mTc]DEA-syn clearly demonstrates localization of the complex in the brain with a T 1/2 of 41 min, suggesting some potential for use with single photon emission computed tomography.\r"

Indium-111 oxine sulfate performed similarly to [111In]oxine with regard to cell labeling capability. Indium-111 oxine sulfonate had no labeling ability. Indium-111 tropolone and Merc were not superior to [111In]oxine as cell labeling agents. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and a CO2 generating compound, diethyl pyrocarbonate, dramatically improved the cell labeling ability in plasma of [111In]tropolone and Merc. In the case of oxine, this improvement was less distinct. Theoretical aspects of the CO2 cell labeling stimulating effect are discussed in terms of intra- and extracellular transferrin and lactoferrin iron (indium) binding capacity. Indium-111 tropolone behaved favorably with respect to inhibition of leukocyte migration, compared with oxine and Merc. Combined with the property of easy cell labeling and good solubility in water, also in the complexed state, tropolone must be regarded as the most suitable cell labeling ligand.\r"

The changes of serum apolipoproteins were compared with the appearance of fatty liver during PM and its disappearance during refeeding. The control group (T) was fed a balanced diet containing 15% casein for 42 d. Two depleted groups (C) and (G1) were fed for 28 d low protein diets containing 2% casein and 5% gluten, respectively, and then were fed the balanced diet for 14 d. During PM a concentration of triacylglycerols (TGs) in liver in the two depleted groups increased; the level in rats fed 2% casein was twice that in rats fed 5% gluten. There was a significant negative correlation between serum TGs and liver TGs. The serum apolipoproteins (apo) did not respond consistently. The high-density lipoproteins apo A-I, A-II and A-IV, which are more than 50% synthetized in the intestine, remained essentially unchanged, thus showing resistance to protein malnutrition. The very low density lipoproteins apo B and total apo C, which mainly originate from liver, were significantly lower in malnourished groups than in controls, while the liver TGs accumulated in malnourished groups. Only the levels of total apo C and apo B48 were correlated with hepatic TG steatosis during malnutrition and refeeding.\r"

Weanling male rats were fed diets containing 10% protein derived from either wheat gluten (experimental diet) or casein (control diet). Intestinal microvillus membranes were isolated after a 7-wk feeding period. The functionality of the membranes, as assessed by the level of activity of the four enzymes alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase and maltase, showed no difference between the membranes derived from the experimental and the control animals. Similar Arrhenius plot patterns of alkaline phosphatase activity (13-50 degrees C) and of the fluorescence anisotropy parameter (8-40 degrees C) were observed for both types of membranes with respect to the transition temperatures and energies of activation. In addition, the similarity between the membranes derived from the experimental and the control animals was also manifested in the cholesterol and phospholipid content. The study demonstrates that despite the extreme nutritional stress exerted on the gluten-fed rats, the integrity and functionality of the intestinal microvillus membrane was adequately maintained.\r"

  ".W": "This study shows that guinea pigs fed 100 times the amount of vitamin C needed for growth and for prevention of scurvy have elevated levels of complement component C1q. C1q is a plasma protein rich in hydroxyproline, an amino acid whose biosynthesis requires ascorbate. C1q is essential for host defense against pathogens, both as a component of the classical complement pathway and as an opsonin in the phagocytosis process. We measured C1q in vitamin C-depleted guinea pigs that had been repleted for 4 wks with the following daily doses of ascorbate (mg/100 g body wt): 0.50 (suboptimal), 2.0 (adequate), 10 (ample) and 50 (tissue saturating). We measured C1q in three ways: indirectly by quantifying protein-bound hydroxyproline and directly by hemolytic assay and by immunodiffusion against anti-C1q. Regardless of the method, plasma C1q was 30-50% higher in animals fed tissue-saturating ascorbate than in those fed adequate or suboptimal amounts of the vitamin (p less than 0.05, one-way analysis of variance, least significant difference test). These data confirm and significantly extend earlier work that provided indirect evidence for a relationship between C1q and ascorbate nutriture in the guinea pig. They are consistent with a possible relationship between ascorbate nutriture and host defense.\r"

These elderly patients (n = 142) had more frequent postoperative complications (26.1% vs. 12.0%, p less than 0.0001), and greater mortality (9.2% vs. 2.7%, p less than 0.005) than did 839 younger patients. Patients with preoperative cardiac, renal or neurologic problems had more frequent postoperative complications whether they were old or young. Postoperative complications were more frequent in the elderly for non-emergency surgery (21.2% vs. 9.7%) but not for emergency surgery (44.8% vs. 42.4%). Logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors of postoperative complications. Age greater than or equal to 70 years was associated with an increase in risk that was not statistically significant.\r"

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was given orally as a further provocation and resulted in an 11-fold increase in urinary lead excretion. A 5-day course of treatment with DMSA was instituted, during which symptoms abated, urinary lead excretion increased and the blood lead level decreased. No side effects were noticed. There has been no relapse over several months of follow-up. The authors conclude that the oral use of DMSA is effective, safe and convenient both as a provocative test in establishing the diagnosis of lead poisoning and as a therapeutic tool.\r"

The efficacy and adverse effects of the agent were studied in 41 hypercholesterolemic subjects by administering daily doses of 5, 20, or 40 mg for four weeks under double-blind conditions. Mean total serum cholesterol level was reduced by 11.1% in the 5-mg group, 18.8% in the 20-mg group, and 25.3% in the 40-mg group. Marked reduction of total serum cholesterol level was also observed in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemics. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and apolipoprotein B concentration decreased by 38.5% and 28.8%, respectively, in the 40-mg group, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased by 11.8%. No serious clinical and laboratory abnormalities were observed. Plasma cortisol and testosterone levels were not significantly affected.

This report describes a method, suitable for use by nursing staff on the ward, to determine oligosaccharide utilization and identify patients utilizing oligosaccharides well. Oligosaccharides excreted in urine are hydrolyzed enymatically to glucose using alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, and the glucose released is measured by a test tape method. The results obtained agree well with the acid hydrolysis-spectrophotometric assay for oligosaccharide excretion used in earlier studies. The method readily identified postsurgical patients utilizing infused oligosaccharides poorly in both prospective and retrospective studies.\r"

Change in plasma prealbumin followed the direction of nitrogen balance in both weeks of IVN in 39 of 54 of the former group, whereas none of the other plasma proteins achieved 50% accuracy. A weekly rise in plasma prealbumin had a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 70%, positive predictive value of 93%, and negative predictive value of 56% in detecting positive nitrogen balance. Results in the patients who received 3 or 4 weeks of IVN showed an improvement in negative predictive value to 79%. None of the other plasma proteins performed as well. Twelve patients suffered a major complication of their disease or died, following their course of IVN. Nitrogen balance was the best prognostic indicator of these patients, whereas a fall in prealbumin was the best of the plasma proteins, with a sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 79%, positive predictive value of 40%, and negative predictive value of 92% in determining the incidence of complications. Prealbumin was the most suitable plasma protein for use as a dynamic index of nutritional progress in the type of patient seen in this study.\r"

Caloric and nitrogen intake were measured and nitrogen balance calculated. There were 117 intervals available for analysis. A mean decrease in transferrin of 12.95 mg/dl was associated with a mean decrease in nitrogen balance of 0.92 g/day, whereas a mean increase in transferrin of 21.04 mg/dl was associated with a mean increase in nitrogen balance of 1.49 g/day; the correlation between changes in transferrin with changes in nitrogen balance was statistically significant (p = 0.02). Upward and downward changes in prealbumin were also associated with corresponding changes in nitrogen balance, but the changes were not statistically significant. Decreases in transferrin and prealbumin were also associated with a lower caloric intake. Operation caused a significant decrease in prealbumin (p = 0.003) and nitrogen balance (p = 0.05); a decrease in transferrin also occurred, but was not statistically significant. There was a highly significant correlation between serum transferrin and prealbumin (p = 0.001) and also between the interval changes in transferrin and prealbumin (p less than 0.001). In conclusion, transferrin was found to correlate closely with prealbumin. Changes in transferrin were more significantly related to changes in nitrogen balance, and from the results of this study, measurement of serum transferrin can be recommended as a useful parameter in following the nutritional status of patients receiving nutritional support.\r"

Tumor-bearing rats infused with diet B had less protein and more fat in their carcasses than those in the other dietary groups. Organs of nontumor- and tumor-bearing rats fed diet B contained less protein and more fat and triglycerides than rats fed either diet A or C. Survival index and hematocrit values were lowest in rats infused with the parenteral lipid diet.

White blood cell glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase levels were measured in conjunction with the trace metals. Three groups of infants were evaluated: group I was relatively healthy, group II were infants with stage 2 bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or less, group III were infants with stage 3 BPD or worse. Zinc and selenium levels declined in all groups during conventional parenteral nutrition (TPN) regimens, while copper remained stable. Copper did decline in groups I and II coincident with an acceleration in growth rate. An expected rise in antioxidant enzyme levels in infants with pulmonary oxygen toxicity was not seen. This study suggests that supplemental selenium as well as an increased zinc intake over current recommendations for premature infants receiving TPN may be indicated.\r"

In the mannitol group, 30 infants received MVI-Pediatric (containing 245 mg mannitol), 65% of a vial/day. Serum and urine osmolality, serum PG, blood-urea-nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, and glucose were measured on days 0, 2, 5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 40 of ivn. Weight, urine output, and fluid intake were measured daily. Vitamin E levels were measured on days 5, 26, and 33 of ivn. There were no significant differences between the groups in birth weight, gestational age, sex, age, or weight at start of ivn. Our results indicated that neither MVI-Concentrate nor MVI-Pediatric was associated with a clinically significant diuresis. MVI-Pediatric, 65% of a vial/day, may produce higher than desirable blood levels of vitamin E, and use of drugs containing PG can produce significant blood levels of PG, in very low birth weight infants.\r"

  ".W": "The adequacy of low dose vitamin D (25 IU/dl) parenteral nutrition (PN) solution was studied in 18 infants. All infants had surgical indications for PN. The birth weights were 2810 +/- 135 g and gestational ages 37.4 +/- 0.5 wk (mean +/- SEM). Duration of study ranged from 5 to 175 days. Thirteen infants were studied for up to 6 weeks and five infants for 71 to 175 days. Results showed that studied infants maintained growth along normal percentiles for weight, length, and head circumference. Vitamin D status as indicated by serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) rose from 15 +/- 1.9 ng/ml to 26 +/- 2.8 ng/ml, mean +/- SEM (p less than 0.001) after 9 days, and remained normal up to 6 months. Five infants with biochemical liver dysfunction also had normal serum 25 OHD concentrations, indicating the hepatic 25 hydroxylation process was not severely impaired. Serum total and ionized calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D-binding protein concentrations were normal. Serum magnesium was mildly elevated in five infants (2.6 to 3 mg/dl) on one occasion and resolved spontaneously. Serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) concentrations rose above baseline values in 12 of 17 infants, but remained within normal range (less than 400 IU/liter at 30 degrees C). Another infant with markedly elevated AP values died from liver dysfunction. Radiographs of the forearms were normal except for marked demineralization in one infant in spite of normal 25 OHD concentrations. We conclude that 25 IU vitamin D/dl of nutrient infusate is adequate to maintain normal vitamin D status, as indicated by normal serum 25 OHD concentrations in infants receiving PN for as long as 6 months.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of parenteral selenium as selenious acid on the selenium status of seven long-term TPN patients. Patients received a dosage of zero, 80, or 160 micrograms Se/day for 1 month each. The measures of selenium status used were selenium levels in plasma and glutathione-peroxidase activities in erythrocytes and platelets. Urinary selenium excretion was measured. Control subjects were selected to match the sex, age, and weight of the patients. With increasing levels of parenteral selenium, there was increasing plasma selenium concentration as well as erythrocyte and platelet glutathione-peroxidase activity. There was no statistical difference between the patients during the time they received the 160 micrograms parenteral selenium treatment and the control subjects for platelet glutathione-peroxidase activity. At the 160 micrograms Se/day level, patient plasma selenium concentrations increased from 28% to 58% of the control levels. Four patients were studied after they returned to the 80 micrograms parenteral selenium/day from the 160-micrograms Se/day treatment. With decreasing parenteral selenium, three patients had decreasing platelet glutathione-peroxidase activity, while plasma selenium concentration decreased in two patients. These data suggest that some patients receiving long-term parenteral nutrition should receive parenteral selenium.\r"

An alternative to this would be to mix the medications in the continuous drip enteral feeding with subsequent continuous administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the compatibility of select medications with Ensure, Ensure Plus, and Osmolite. We observed neither visible abnormalities in the mixtures nor change in pH of the enteral products after the addition of digoxin, theophylline, phenytoin, methyldopa, or furosemide. The addition of theophylline to all three enteral products caused a substantial increase in the osmolality. We also examined the concentrations of the mixtures to detect any changes occurring over the 12-hr infusion time. A wide variation in concentrations after the addition of phenytoin suspension was corrected by adding the injectable form to the enteral products. Digoxin and furosemide concentrations were essentially unchanged; however, the methyldopa concentration decreased up to 23% over the 12-hr study period. We, therefore, cannot recommend the addition of theophylline, phenytoin suspension, or methyldopa to the three enteral products tested.\r"

All of the patients with dislodged feeding tubes were confused, disoriented, or obtunded periodically. Various means for preventing this problem are discussed. In view of both the considerable time and effort required to place nasoenteral feeding tubes properly and the potential complications due to inadvertent tubes dislodgement, it is recommended that nasoenteral feeding tubes be secured more effectively, particularly in confused or obtunded patients.\r"

Important aspects in the prevention of infection in central venous catheters used for parenteral nutrition have included: the method of central venous access, subcutaneous tunneling, dressing change techniques, therapeutic uses of the catheter, and catheter-intravenous tubing connection care. Methods of predicting infection and evaluating catheter sepsis have been described. The efficacy of intervention by specialized nutrition support teams in infection control related to these catheters has been demonstrated. Newer partially implantable and completely implantable venous access devices have been used for parenteral nutrition. Methods of infection control and prevention of mechanical damage of these types of catheters have been examined with various results. Care and composition of central venous catheters have been shown to have some role in thrombus formation in the central veins. The use of heparin to prevent thrombosis and catheter occlusion, and the varying degrees of success obtained, have been described. Medical treatment of the occluded catheter with urokinase may be a necessary alternative to discontinuance of that catheter. Overall consideration of research methods used to reach conclusions for catheter care should be considered in the evaluation of appropriate care in each situation.\r"

Combinations of L-histidinol and anticancer drugs of either phase specificity [cytarabine (ara-C) and vinblastine sulfate] or cycle specificity [5-fluorouracil (FUra) and methotrexate] had diverse effects on cultured mastocytoma cells as scored by clonogenic cell survival assays. Flow cytometric analysis of randomly proliferating P815 mastocytoma cells revealed that although exposure to L-histidinol did not preclude cells from traversing the cell cycle, the analogue nonetheless conferred a dose-dependent and apparently nonspecific delay of cell cycle transit. DBA/2J mice bearing intraperitoneal P815 mastocytoma cells were used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of L-histidinol-ara-C and of L-histidinol-FUra combinations. Quantitative cell survival assays of murine bone marrow cells and of clonogenic tumor cells obtained from treated animals demonstrated that L-histidinol eliminated the bone marrow toxicity otherwise attending the use of the drugs ara-C and FUra. Simultaneously, the inclusion of L-histidinol provided a statistically significant increase in the capacity of these two anticancer drugs to eradicate intraperitoneal mastocytoma cells.\r"

The selection criteria were presence of active intestinal schistosomiasis and absence of any surgical or other medical disease which could explain the renal disease. When examined by light microscopy, kidney biopsies showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in nine, membranous in four, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in two, sclerosing glomerulonephritis in one case, and no changes in another case. Direct immunofluorescence showed IgG deposits in 13 cases, IgM in 10 and different complement components (C3, C1q) in eight cases. Eluates from the kidney biopsies of the 17 schistosomal as well as six control cases were examined by ELISA against schistosoma mansoni adult worm antigen (AWA). This test showed the presence of antibodies against the AWA in 12 out of 17 of the schistosomal cases, and zero out of six of the controls. When examined by direct IFA using sheep anti-circulating anodic antigen/FITC and by indirect IFA using monoclonal antischistosomal CAA IgG3, kidney biopsies of the ELISA positive cases showed granular deposits of circulating anodic antigen (CAA). We conclude that schistosomal specific nephropathy does exist in the clinical settings and can lead to end-stage renal disease, with CAA probably being a major responsible antigen.\r"

For comparison, the effects of HCTZ treatment on Na-K-ATPase activity in the nephron segments of age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were also determined. Na-K-ATPase activity in proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL), cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL), distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) was significantly lower in HCTZ-treated SHR compared to control (untreated) SHR. However, there was no significant difference in Na-K-ATPase activity in proximal straight tubule (PST) and medullary collecting duct (MCD) between HCTZ-treated and control SHR. HCTZ treatment also produced a significant decrease in blood pressure (BP) and creatinine clearance (CCr) in SHR. On the other hand, HCTZ treatment did not produce a significant change in Na-K-ATPase activity in PCT, PST, MTAL, CTAL and MCD, in BP or in CCr in WKY. However, HCTZ treatment produced a decrease in the enzyme activity in the DCT and an increase in the enzyme activity in the CCD in WKY. The decrease in Na-K-ATPase activity in almost all nephron segments from SHR may be due to a significant decrease in CCr produced by HCTZ. On the other hand, a decrease in Na-K-ATPase activity in the DCT with an increase in the enzyme activity in the CCD from WKY suggest that renal compensation to the natriuretic effect of HCTZ occurs by an increase in Na+ reabsorption in the CCD.\r"

In order to pinpoint eventual site(s) of ANF action along the nephron, proximal tubules, thick ascending limbs and papillary collecting ducts were isolated from dog kidneys as well as proximal tubules from rat kidneys. The substrate uptake (O2, lactate, glutamine, glucose) and production of metabolites (glutamate, ammonium, alanine, glucose) by these nephron segments were measured in absence or presence of the diuretic agents or the vehicle for ANF (acetate 1 mM). The total ATP turnover and the contribution of identified metabolic pathways for this turnover was calculated. It was expected that a molecule with diuretic properties reducing the permeability of cell membranes to NaCl would secondarily reduce the Na-K-ATPase activity, and therefore the oxygen and substrate utilization by affected cells. It was shown: that each nephron segment used presented the expected specific metabolic characteristics; that furosemide markedly inhibits the oxidative metabolism of thick ascending limbs; that acetate (the vehicle used for ANF) displaces the oxidation of glutamine and lactate in nephron segments with aerobic metabolism; that ANF had no effect on the metabolism of the studied segments despite the presence of specific c'GMP-generating receptors in the distal nephron. It is concluded that ANF must exert its natriuretic effect by a mechanism different from that of classical diuretics.\r"

The original plan of therapy was for continuous therapy (200 rads/day) of 6,000 rads of pelvic radiation for 6 weeks plus intrauterine radium. However, 16 patients received 6,000 rads in 8 weeks by split-course therapy (2-week rest after 3,000 rads) plus radium. Twenty-nine patients received the planned continuous therapy. The median dose of pelvic radiation for patients who received continuous therapy or split-course radiation was 6,000 rads.

This case is presented as an example of an alternative in treatment for this type of carcinoma and to illustrate the problems of differential diagnosis of liver defects on the CT scan in patients on longterm hyperalimentation.\r"

Both groups also received prednisone and azathioprine. In threatened rejection, rescue treatment consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). 33B3.1 was well tolerated, with mild fever during the first 2 days being the most common side-effect. 3 patients in group A had a reversible acute rejection episode before day 14, whereas only 1 patient in group B had reversible rejection. 20 of 30 historical control patients (prednisone/azathioprine) and 2 of 55 patients previously treated with ATG had a rejection episode in a similar period after transplantation. Trough levels of 33B3.1 in the blood ranged from undetectable to 1.6 micrograms/ml in group A and from 0.3 to 9 micrograms/ml in group B. Most patients had antibodies against 33B3.1 by the end of treatment.\r"

Post-mating isolation mechanisms include hybrid breakdown, hybrid sterility and hybrid lethality and may, in some cases, be reinforced by pre-mating mechanisms such as ethological differentiation. In the Drosophila melanogaster species sub-group post-mating reproductive isolation is ensured by both the inviability and the sterility of hybrids. For example when D. melanogaster females are crossed to D. simulans males the hybrid progeny are normally all female; the hybrid males die as third instar larvae. The viable hybrid females are totally sterile. Little is known of the genetic basis for either hybrid sterility or hybrid inviability, although Coyne and others have begun a genetic analysis of the sterility of hybrids within this species sub-group. We have discovered a single gene difference that rescues the otherwise inviable male hybrids from the cross between D. melanogaster females and males of its three closest relatives. The study of this locus may shed light on the genetic control of both speciation and development.\r"

To understand the relationship of the various signals (mitogens and/or lymphokines) that bring about progress along this pathway, it is desirable to define a series of 'minimal signals', each of which stimulates the cell to proceed to a further stage in this process of differentiation. Stimulation of lymphocytes with two different monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD2 surface molecule induces a proliferative response; we report here that both CD4+ and CD8+ cells proliferate in response to such a stimulus but do not develop cytotoxicity. Addition of recombinant gamma-interferon (rIFN-gamma) or recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) to the activated cells leads to acquisition of cytotoxic status by the CD8+ cells but not the CD4+ cells. The availability, in addition to precursors and effectors, of an apparently intermediate stage in the form of proliferating CD8+ cells that are non-cytotoxic should facilitate both cellular and molecular studies of this maturation pathway; the differences between CD4+ and CD8+ cells in development of cytotoxicity under these experimental conditions is a valuable model for understanding differentiation of T lymphocytes.\r"

The response to an antigen is controlled by a gene termed the immune response (Ir) gene, which is transmitted as a single dominant trait. We have provided evidence for similar immune suppression (Is) genes which control non-responsiveness through the antigen specific suppressor T cell. The non-responsiveness is also dominantly inherited and the Is genes are linked to the histocompatibility (HLA) antigen system. Here we report that the HLA-DR2 molecule from a non-responder haplotype (HLA-Dw12-DR2-DQwl) is required for the proliferative T cell response to schistosoma japonicum (Sj) antigen, as a restriction element, indicating that the HLA-DR2 is the product of the Ir gene, and that the HLA-DQwl molecule of the non-responder haplotype is important in the antigen-specific suppression of the response to this antigen, suggesting that it is the product of the Is gene. We therefore conclude that the HLA-DR and DQ molecules, which are controlled by the distinct genes in the MHC multigene family, regulate immune response and immune suppression and that the gene for HLA-DQ is epistatic to that for HLA-DR in controlling the immune response to schistosomal antigen in humans.\r"

  ".U": "87229058\r", 
  ".W": "Although activated human T and B lymphocytes express both high-affinity and low-affinity membrane receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2), the structural features that distinguish these receptors have remained unresolved. The high-affinity receptors appear to mediate IL-2 induced T cell growth and internalization of IL-2, whereas no function has yet been ascribed to the low-affinity receptors. The Tac antigen is an IL-2 binding protein of relative molecular mass 55,000 (Mr 55K) that participates in the formation of both high- and low-affinity receptors. But Tac complementary DNA transfection and membrane fusion studies have suggested that additional T-cell components are required to produce high-affinity IL-2 receptors. In this study, we report the identification of a second human IL-2 binding protein that (1) has an Mr of approximately 70K, (2) lacks reactivity with the anti-Tac antibody, (3) binds IL-2 with intermediate affinity and (4) is present on the surface of resting T cells, large granular lymphocytes (natural killer cells), and certain T and B cell lines in the absence of the Tac antigen. Chemical crosslinking of 125I-labelled IL-2 bound to high-affinity IL-2 receptors produces labelling of both the p70 protein and the Tac antigen and the anti-Tac antibody blocks the crosslink detection of both of these proteins. Expression of Tac cDNA in a T cell line expressing the p70 protein, but lacking both Tac and high-affinity receptors, results in the reconstitution of high-affinity IL-2 receptors in these cells. Together, these findings suggest that the high-affinity human IL-2 receptor may be a membrane complex composed of at least the p70 protein and Tac antigen.\r"

At least two specific DNA rearrangements involving the nitrogen-fixation (nif) genes occur during heterocyst differentiation, one within the nifD gene and the other near the nifS gene. The two rearrangements have several properties in common. Both occur quantitatively in all heterocyst genomes, both occur at approximately the same developmental time, late in the process of heterocyst differentiation, and both result from site-specific recombination between short repeated DNA sequences. We report here the nucleotide sequences found at the site of recombination near the nifS gene. These sequences differ from those found previously for the nifD rearrangement, suggesting that the two rearrangements are catalysed by different enzymes and may be regulated independently. We also show that the nifS gene is transcribed only from rearranged genomes.\r"

The syndromic approach attempts to subdivide the patient population into relatively homogeneous groups, largely on the basis of clinical and EEG criteria. In contrast, the neurobiological approach aims to formulate a unique profile for each patient by incorporating particulars of the patient onto the background of knowledge regarding the etiologic factors important in generalized epilepsy. The value of these two approaches is discussed with regard to the dual aims of, first, improving the understanding of generalized epilepsy, and second, providing a precise diagnosis, an accurate prognosis, and optimal treatment for the patient.\r"

Two control groups received no DMBA treatment. After carcinogen application, the animals in one DMBA-treated group and those in one of the control groups were given indomethacin daily; this was administered through the oral route for an additional 10 weeks. At this time, all of the animals were killed and their cheek pouches, the draining cervical lymph nodes, and other organs were removed for examination. The number and size of tumors in each pouch were recorded, and each pouch was weighed. Indomethacin, in the dosage administered, was not found to cause regression of established tumors. The effects of prostaglandins, indomethacin, and other prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitors in tumor tissue are discussed. It is suggested that more knowledge is needed about the role of prostaglandins, and the related products of AA metabolism, in squamous cell cancer before indomethacin is used therapeutically.\r"

  ".U": "87230328\r", 
  ".W": "Because little is known about the mechanisms involved in local tumor-host immune reactions in squamous carcinoma of the head and neck, a study was undertaken to better characterize the types of immune cells present at the local tumor site and determine their relationship to tumor extent, systemic cellular immune parameters, and clinical outcome. In 40 untreated patients, lymphocyte subsets (LS) at the tumor-host interface were quantitated immunohistologically from serial sections of frozen tumor specimens and correlated with concurrently measured peripheral LS levels and in vitro lymphocyte reactivity to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). The majority of infiltrating lymphocytes were T cells with rare B or Leu 7 cells. Proportions of T4 and T8 were similar in peritumor stroma; however, T8 cells predominated tumor parenchyma. Stromal and parenchymal infiltration by LS were not related to peripheral blood LS levels, lymphocyte reactivity, or tumor site. However, parenchymal T11 and T4 cell infiltration was less in advanced primary tumors (T3, T4) than in early tumors (T1, T2) (P = 0.01, P = 0.067, respectively), as was peripheral lymphocyte reactivity to PHA (P = 0.013). Short-term disease-free interval and actuarial survival differed significantly--according to parenchymal T11 and T4 cell infiltration--and were not related to T8, Leu 7, and B-cell infiltration. The findings extend prior studies of lymphocytic infiltration in head and neck cancer and demonstrate the potential importance of differences in tumor stromal and parenchymal infiltration. Together with recent evidence that T4 cells are critical for lymphokine production and for the proliferation of cytotoxic effector cells, the current results suggest that T4 cells play a critical role in the local immune response in squamous carcinoma of the head and neck.\r"

  ".U": "87230329\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to examine the feasibility of transcutaneous stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Electrical activation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve was achieved by applying a blunt electrode to the intact neck skin at specific points along the tracheoesophageal groove in anesthetized adult dogs. The stimulus consisted of 10 mA cathodal pulses, each of 1 msec duration, delivered at a frequency of 10 Hz and increased by 10 Hz increments up to 100 Hz. Vocal cord excursion was directly related to the frequency of applied current. In all six dogs studies, stimulation at 30 Hz resulted in maximal ipsilateral vocal cord abduction, while stimulation at frequencies greater than 40 Hz resulted in ipsilateral vocal cord adduction up to or across the midline. Vocal cord movement was immediate and persisted for the duration of the stimulus train. Surrounding neck muscles were not visibly activated. We propose that the observed frequency-dependent movement of the vocal cords occurred because of the difference between the contraction times of the intrinsic abductor and adductor muscles of the larynx. Transcutaneous recurrent laryngeal nerve stimulation appears promising, both as a diagnostic aid in laryngoscopy and as a therapeutic tool in controlling the glottic aperture.\r"

At least 15 (65%) of the patients are known to have developed metastases. Nine of these (60%) presented with only regional lymph node metastases, one of which was occult. Surgery is the treatment of choice, with the extent dependent on the stage of disease. Radiation therapy appears ineffective, and chemotherapy is largely untested.

Although surgery and irradiation are the mainstays of treatment, patients with recurrent tumors and those with unresectable or metastatic cancer are not candidates for this usual approach. Ten patients with recurrent, metastatic, or unresectable salivary gland tumors were treated with combination chemotherapy, primarily with cisplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin), and cyclophosphamide, or cisplatin with 5-fluorouracil. In patients whose tumors exhibited no response, second-line drugs were used. The overall response rate was 50%--with one complete response--but the duration of response was short. This report contributes to the growing data base that demonstrates definite chemosensitivity of these tumors. To date, 116 patients have been reviewed. Adenocarcinoma-like cancers respond best to cisplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and 5-fluorouracil. High-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma may show a sensitivity similar to that of squamous cell carcinoma. Multi-institutional protocols need to be developed to assess the roles of adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy in the treatment of salivary gland cancer.\r"

It was used in this study for the purposes of constructing growth curves of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and collecting pilot data on the effects that indomethacin and cisplatin have on this malignant condition. Nine of the ten assays performed were evaluable. Indomethacin, cisplatin, or both were used as treatment drugs in each assay. One-millimeter fragments of viable tumor, from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, were implanted beneath the renal capsules of normal immunocompetent mice. Baseline and posttreatment measurements were made of the xenografts, and response to treatment was determined by comparing changes in tumor sizes of the test and control groups. Results indicated that reduction in tumor sizes occurred in indomethacin-treated mice in four assays and in cisplatin-treated mice in six assays. In addition, two separate growth curves were calculated by plotting the mean change in tumor size in five mice per day on days 3 through 7. In conclusion, the subrenal capsule assay is a relatively rapid and inexpensive assay in which squamous cell carcinoma remains viable and therapeutic agents can be tested. However, clinical trials that use this assay to choose treatment drugs are needed in order to correlate assay results with clinical responses.\r"

The purpose of this article is to review this basic technique and to describe additional modifications that further simplify tympanoplasty grafting. These modifications include canal flap advancement, the use of multiple fascia grafts, techniques for securing the graft to the malleus handle, and the use of tragal cartilage in grafting. With this technique, a 95% take rate was observed at 3 months, and the graft was firmly attached to the malleus handle in all cases.\r"

Given preoperatively, some chemotherapeutic agents adversely affect wound healing. The specific purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of cisplatin on wound healing when it is given preoperatively. Forty-four Swiss outbred mice were divided into control and treatment groups. One week before surgery, the treatment group received cisplatin (2 mg/kg body weight) by subcutaneous injections on 2 consecutive days. Each control animal was given an equal volume of normal saline. A 1.5 cm transverse incision was made in each animal, and wounds were closed with surgical staples. The mean wound-breaking strength was determined for a minimum of 5 treatment and 5 control mice on postoperative days 6, 10, 13, and 16. Serum creatinine, blood cell counts, and changes in weight were also monitored. Results showed wound strength on postoperative day 10 to be significantly reduced in mice treated with cisplatin (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference for wound strength on any other days and all other variables were similar between both groups. In conclusion, cisplatin has an adverse effect on wound healing, the peak of which probably occurs during the proliferative stage of wound healing. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal time for surgery after preoperative chemotherapy. All new chemotherapeutic agents, particularly those being considered in a preoperative regimen, should be tested in this manner.\r"

This assembly is positioned on the stapes capitulum, with the synthetic cup forming a dynamic joint. During 1978, 114 patients underwent surgical procedures in which an ossicle cup prosthesis was used. After 1 year 84% of these patients were within 20 dB of their preoperative bone hearing levels. Patients with a concurrent mastoidectomy did worse than those who underwent only a tympanoossiculoplasty. Five years later, 74% of the successful cases were still within 20 dB of the preoperative hearing levels. Eighteen patients underwent a revision surgical procedure to regain hearing. The postoperative hearing results at 1 year were 50% within 20 dB. The causes of failure included further ossicle necrosis (28%), a laterally healed tympanic membrane (39%), and fixation of the prosthesis (33%). Extrusion of the prosthesis during the 5-year period was between 1% and 2%. Overall, the ossicle cup prosthesis has proved to be a stable assembly, easy to revise, and longlasting.

Age-specific nasal resistance standards had been previously accumulated from an unselected representative sample of 498 youngsters, drawn from socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds similar to those of the orthodontic group. Resistance data collected from 211 orthodontic patients were found to fall in an almost linear arrangement, varying inversely with age. Age-specific nasal resistance mean data were found to be consistently higher than comparable age-specific mean data of the unselected comparative sample. When orthodontic nasal resistance data were compared with cephalometric measurements of anterior lower vertical face height in 60 patients, there was a definitive correlation between elevation in nasal resistance and increased lower vertical face-height measurements.\r"

A surgeon may review and refine surgical technique, and colleagues around the world may study the situation from the same vantage point after surgery has been completed. Referring physicians may be kept graphically informed of the findings and progress of their patients. With the development of such modern technologies as laser microsurgery, an objective means of assessing ablation of disease and healing of surgical wounds is now available, and many of the extravagant claims of \"no bleeding, and no edema during or after surgery\" may be confirmed or refuted. I shall describe techniques for endoscopic examination and photodocumentation of the ears, anterior and posterior nares, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative patient. Techniques for obtaining high-quality color transparencies and color and sound videotapes will be presented. Equipment is simple and relatively inexpensive, and no special knowledge of photography is required. Examples of benign and malignant disease of the ears, nose, nasopharynx, and larynx will be shown before, during, and at regular intervals after microsurgery with the CO2 laser.\r"

A CO2 laser, coupled to an operating microscope, was used to ablate the surface epithelium of the right true vocal cords in eight canines, while conventional microlaryngeal stripping was performed on the left true cords in the same animals. Photographs were taken immediately after injury and again before the animals were killed. Histologically, the series of true vocal cords ablated by the CO2 laser revealed granulation formation at day 5, whereas those treated with conventional stripping developed granulation at day 3, thus indicating delayed healing. Charred carbonaceous debris of CO2 laser ablation was found to cause a giant cell reaction that persisted after reepithelization. Despite the precise control offered by the laser, many of the laser-injured true vocal cords revealed vocalis muscle edema and muscle destruction. After healing occurred, dense fibrosis was found in the vocal muscle injured during CO2 laser ablation of the overlying squamous epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "Since the advent of brainstem auditory evoked response audiometry and computerized tomography, small acoustic neuromas are more frequently found. Often the patient has serviceable hearing, which we would like to preserve during complete tumor removal. Since 1978, sixteen patients with acoustic neuromas have been operated upon through the retrosigmoid suboccipital approach, with the goal of hearing preservation. In 1983, we began using intraoperative direct eighth nerve monitoring, which produced a rapid assessment of cochlear nerve function during the excision of small acoustic neuromas. The tumors varied in size from intracanalicular lesions to one lesion with a 3.0 cm protrusion medial to the porus acousticus. In eight of sixteen cases, intraoperative monitoring was used, and in four of the patients hearing was preserved. In eight cases, intraoperative monitoring was not used, and hearing was preserved in only two patients. The overall success rate--in total tumor removal with hearing preservation--was 37%. Hearing was preserved in six of eight patients who had tumors which measured less than 1.5 cm. In this group of cases, two of the patients had a Class I good hearing result (PTA 0 to 30 dB and 70 to 100% discrimination), one patient had Class III nonserviceable hearing, (PTA 65 to 75 dB and 25 to 45% discrimination), and three patients had Class IV poor hearing, (PTA 80 to 100 dB and 0 to 20% discrimination). We found that continuous monitoring of direct eighth-nerve-evoked action potentials were extremely valuable and rapidly indicated reversible cochlear nerve trauma.\r"

In 46 cases (25%), the diagnosis of herpes zoster was confirmed by acute and convalescent serum titers for varicella-zoster virus. In 139 cases (75%), viral titers were not performed and the diagnosis was based on the characteristic clinical presentation of the Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The data were subjected to multivariate analysis evaluating age, sex, race, signs, and symptoms at onset, severity of paralysis, associated medical problems with concomitant neurologic deficits, and response to therapy. These were compared with data of 1202 patients with Bell's (herpes simplex) palsy. The facial palsy of Ramsay Hunt syndrome was found to be more severe, to cause late neural denervation, and to have a less favorable recovery profile than Bell's (herpes simplex) facial palsy. Prognostic factors and treatment recommendations are discussed.\r"

There exists some controversy as to the mechanism underlying the clinically observed hypoxemia; some authors postulate a nasal pulmonary reflex as the basis for the hypoxemia. In an attempt to further investigate this theory, collateral ventilation was measured in the dog model during nasal and laryngeal stimulation. Collateral ventilation is thought to be one of the most sensitive techniques available to assess the resistive and elastic properties of the lung periphery. In the dog, with respiratory rate controlled (i.e., anesthetized and paralyzed), nasal stimulation with mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli failed to affect collateral ventilation. This finding suggests that the reflex may be acting either in larger lung segments or on the pulmonary vascular bed itself.\r"

Thus, thoughtful preoperative evaluation is essential in planning the appropriate surgical approach, to prevent such complications as cerebral spinal fluid leaks and meningitis. Preoperative computerized tomographic (CT) scans are useful in visualizing bony defects, but are not well suited for soft tissue imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the latest advance in cross-sectional imaging technology. It offers superior soft tissue contrast, is noninvasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. It is particularly useful in imaging encephaloceles. Three cases of congenital midline masses are presented as illustrations. Two dermoid cysts demonstrate the usefulness of MRI in ruling out intracranial extension. A large encephalocele dramatically demonstrates the superiority of MRI in imaging the brain herniating into the nose. Since MRI is noninvasive and does not use ionizing radiation, it should be considered before CT scanning, to rule out intracranial extension.\r"

All of them had multiple treatment vials made, dependent on the type of testing they had, and the vials all included the ten inhalants that were tested for. All patients had been treated for a year with weekly immunotherapy injections. Specific IgG levels, blocking antibody levels to the ten inhalant allergens, were determined. The results were that the patients who had been scratch tested had the lowest levels of specific IgG blocking antibody--while both intradermal end point titration and modified RAST testing had much higher elevations of blocking IgG antibody, with the RAST having the highest. It is concluded that, since the treatment vials prepared after scratch testing of all the antigens are at the same concentration, there are many antigens that are not given in adequate amounts to cause a good IgG response whereas, by calibrating the concentrations of antigens in the intradermal titration and the modified RAST testing, all the antigens are being injected in sufficient quantities to get a good blocking antibody response.\r"

Marked differences in phonatory flow signal were seen in the two groups. The normal phonatory flow signal is quasiperiodic, with excellent cycle-to-cycle repetition at the frequency of vocal fold vibration. The signal's spectral energy is dominated by the fundamental and its harmonics. The phonatory flow signal in cancer is characterized by random and aperiodic fluctuations. There is decreased AC-to-DC signal ratio. The phonatory signal spectra reveal little harmonic power. The loss of periodic flow signal is consistent with clinical observation of aperiodic vocal fold vibration in cancer. The analysis of airflow signal is a potentially valuable method for monitoring airflow during phonation in conditions affecting the larynx.\r"

Twenty patients with sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus participated in a double-blind crossover study. Both active devices and internally disconnected placebo devices, supplied by the manufacturer, were used. Reduction in severity of tinnitus was reported by 2 of 20 patients (10%) with the active device and by 4 of 20 (20%) with the placebo device. Fifteen of 20 (75%) had no relief with either device. Those who preferred the placebo device, however, reported only minimal relief, while one of the two who preferred the active device stated it had reduced tinnitus severity by 70% to 80%. This patient was recalled for a series of one-hour test sessions, during which either an active or placebo device was used, according to a random schedule. On each of four on trials, the score for severity of tinnitus for each ear decreased by at least 50% (median = 70%), while in three off trials, the severity of tinnitus was unchanged or decreased by up to 30% (median = 16%). We conclude that the Theraband headset is effective for a small proportion of patients with sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.\r"

In all cases (100%)--which included seven small tumors--vestibular evaluation with HA was abnormal. Slow harmonic acceleration, as is the case with other methods of vestibular evaluation, is not specific for acoustic tumors.

During exploratory tympanotomy, no fistulas were evident; however, both the oval and round windows were repaired with tissue grafts. Follow up--for 1 to 5 years--revealed that vertigo was relieved in all patients. Postoperatively, one patient had a mild conductive hearing loss; yet no patient sustained a sensory neural hearing loss. We conclude that patch grafting of both the oval and round windows is a safe and effective method of treating suspected, but inapparent fistulas. Patient selection, surgical technique, and results shall be detailed.\r"

Evoked potentials are recorded by averaging an optimal number of responses (that are time-locked) to the same number of appropriate stimuli. Adequate stimulus levels and \"minimal\" response latency are necessary for recording evoked potentials. Vestibular evoked potentials have received considerably less attention because of the difficulty in providing appropriate stimuli, the relatively long latency of vestibular responses, and the adaptation of the vestibular system to repeated stimulation. Technological advances have made it possible to provide accurate stimuli by use of computer-controlled rotating chairs and computer-averaging procedures.\r"

Because no previous report has objectively described the quantity or quality of such postnatal remnants in normal infants, it has not been possible to accurately evaluate the significance of mesenchyme remaining in the middle ears of infants with pathologic conditions, such as otitis media and congenital anomalies. Thus, 53 temporal bones obtained from 41 individuals reported upon here--from 26 weeks' gestation to 8 years of age--will be controls for future studies of pathologic conditions. The children from whom these temporal bones were obtained had no anomalies of the ear (or any other known part of the body); nor did they have any pathologic conditions in the ear. The temporal bones were prepared for histologic study with hematoxylin and eosin staining and were examined under the light microscope. After areas of the mesenchyme in the histologic sections were projected and illustrated for each of 19 portions in the middle ear cleft under the microprojector, those areas were measured by compensating polar planimetry. The findings obtained in this study were as follows: The amount of mesenchyme remaining in the days after birth seemed to gradually decrease in volume with increased maturity and had nearly disappeared within the first year in normal infants. Where mesenchyme was noted in the temporal bones of infants over 1 year of age, it was usually present only in small niches.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

None of the patients experienced scarring, epidermal thinning, or hypopigmentation. This lack of complications, associated with an incidence of desirable results in twelve of the thirteen patients, is noteworthy because all but one of the patients with portwine stain had difficult-to-treat lesions whose treatment is not attempted by many ALT centers.

Two patients with persistent postoperative hoarseness had had anterior commissure lesions and previous radiotherapy; the other patient had a subtotal cordectomy. One patient developed a subsequent new lesion 27 months after the initial laser treatment; he was successfully managed with a second endoscopic laser excision. Involvement of the anterior commissure or involvement of the vocal process with minimally invasive disease proved not to be a contraindication to laser excision. The overall results in this small series suggest that laser excision of T1 vocal cord carcinoma is an excellent method of treatment.\r"

Examples of these advantages will be provided from case studies, and the possibility that real-time monitoring may improve ability to preserve hearing will be discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The cochlear and vestibular nerves rotate 90 degrees from the inner ear to the brain stem. Most of the rotation occurs within the internal auditory canal (IAC); only minimal rotation occurs in the cerebellopontine (CP) angle. At the labyrinthine end of the IAC, the cochlear nerve--which at first lies anterior to the inferior vestibular nerve (saccular nerve)--rapidly fuses with the inferior vestibular nerve. It then rotates to become inferior as the nerves leave the porus acousticus. The cochleovestibular (C-V) cleavage plane lies in a superior-inferior direction in the lateral IAC and rotates to become anterior-posterior in the CP angle. In 25% of patients in whom no C-V cleavage plane can be seen, it is not possible to completely transect all vestibular fibers. The surgical implications are that the most complete vestibular neurectomy can be done only in the lateral IAC, the cochlear and inferior vestibular nerves, because of their intimate association, should not be separated in the mid-IAC, in order to prevent damage to the cochlear nerve, and to create a complete denervation of the vestibular labyrinth, only the posterior ampullary nerve along with the superior vestibular nerve should be transected.\r"

Patients who were identified as requiring pedicled flap reconstruction were potential candidates for the study. Later, patients were randomly assigned to receive cefoperazone sodium for either 24 hours or 120 hours. In each case, the drug was administered intravenously, beginning 1 to 2 hours preoperatively and continued for the prescribed period. One hundred nine patients were evaluable. Fifty-three patients were assigned to 1 day of perioperative prophylaxis. Wound infection developed in ten patients (18.9%). Fifty-six patients were assigned to 5 days of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Wound infection developed in 14 (25%) of these patients (P greater than .05). These data suggest that no beneficial effect from administration of antibiotics for longer than 24 hours postoperatively can be achieved in patients who undergo myocutaneous flap reconstruction.\r"

However, some authorities have questioned the value in the overall rehabilitation of patients affected by this disorder. The first phase of this study included fourteen large dogs in which acute subglottic lesions were created by use of a high-speed electric drill and electrocautery. Twelve animals served as the experimental group and two animals were controls. Obstructing lesions developed in all the animals within 7 to 21 days. When at least a 50% obstruction developed in an animal, a treatment plan was instituted that included at least weekly dilatation, removal of granulations, and administration of intralesional steroids and/or systemic steroids and antibiotics. The two control animals became totally obstructed and were killed. Varying degrees of subglottic stenosis developed in all twelve experimental animals after 8 weeks of dilatation, but none required a tracheotomy. These twelve animals were then subjected to 8 additional weeks of dilatation and antibiotics, and supplemental steroids were used in some animals from this study. It can be concluded that early periodic dilatation and granulation removal in the acutely injured subglottis is effective in prevention of severe stenosis, late periodic dilatations in chronic subglottic stenosis are not helpful in further alleviation of obstruction, the concomitant use of antibiotics and systemic steroids did not appreciably prevent or alter the development of subglottic stenosis, and the concomitant use of intralesional steroids appeared to be of benefit in the management of chronic acquired subglottic stenosis.\r"

The finding occurred with peripheral and central nervous system diagnoses as well as with patients whose dizziness was considered psychogenic or was undiagnosed. Maximum slow component velocity (SCV) of vertical nystagmus was usually half or less than that of the nystagmus in the horizontal lead. The SCV time profiles of the nystagmus in horizontal and vertical leads differed considerably. Possible origins of vertical nystagmus are discussed. Whatever the origin, it is clear that the finding of vertical nystagmus in routine caloric testing does not automatically denote disease of the central nervous system.\r"

It has been used successfully in five patients who underwent soft palatectomy for malignant disease. The flaps have been the full width of the pharynx and extended down to the esophageal inlet. Viability of the flap is excellent, and the donor site is allowed to heal by secondary intention. Excellent function has been achieved in all cases with no compromise of oncological principles.\r"

The purpose of this study was to identify immune mechanisms which might contribute to Bell's palsy. The lymphocyte transformation test and immunofluorescence were evaluated with a soluble homogenate of unrefined peripheral nerve antigens. Three antigen-nonspecific tests were also studied. Results in 14 patients with Bell's palsy were compared with those in 21 controls. To be eligible for study, patients with Bell's palsy had to be seen within 10 days of onset of weakness. The control group included 5 patients with facial nerve dysfunction from other causes and 16 normal volunteers. No patient or control had previously received steroids. Five patients with Bell's palsy and one normal volunteer had abnormal lymphocyte transformation (p less than .05). Virtually all other tests were normal. These results. suggest that some instances of Bell's palsy result from cell-mediated immunity against peripheral nerve antigens. They also encourage further research in steroid and other immunotherapy.\r"

The assessment included tests for saccade and smooth pursuit, and the vestibulo-ocular reflex and its cancellation, as evaluated by sinusoidal and pseudorandom rotation in a high-frequency hydraulic chair (up to 5 Hz). Analysis of results showed that the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain, depressed soon after drug intake, recovered substantially after a few hours. Changes in VOR gain were more pronounced with higher frequencies of rotation at 2 and 3 Hz, and greater with pseudorandom than sinusoidal stimulation. Under barbiturate influence, pursuit and VOR cancellation followed distinctly different time courses of recovery. This dissociation between VOR cancellation and pursuit supports the theory that these two systems are subserved by different mechanisms. Saccadic hypermetria was also observed after drug intake.\r"

Until recently radiographic techniques have unfortunately failed to demonstrate fibrous or bony obstruction of the basal turn of the cochlea, which may cause difficulties during cochlear implantation. Intraoperative findings have been correlated with preoperative imaging in a consecutive group of six cochlear implant recipients and a series of consistent radiographic signs that may indicate the presence of obstruction of the scala tympani have been identified. A classification system has been developed. Based on thin-section high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT), the system has been used preoperatively on six cochlear implant recipients. In addition, a systematic evaluation of the temporal bone has been developed for precochlear implant evaluation. This includes the thickness of the parietal bone for seating of the receiving device, the degree of pneumatization of the mastoid, the measurement of the size of the facial recess, the description of the size and orientation of the round window niche, and the patency of the basal turn of the cochlea.\r"

After local infiltration, a small incision is made across the medial edge of the brachial biceps and the vein is isolated from the artery and median nerve. An introducer is used to aid in insertion of the catheter. Catheter position is checked with a postoperative radiograph of the chest. Sixty of our patients have had catheters in place from 14 to 200 days, with few complications. There was one catheter-related death from acute bacterial endocarditis and one case of clinical thrombosis. The surgical approach to the deep brachial vein provides a simple and safe method of long-term central venous access in the head and neck oncology patient, whereas regional therapy and treatment planning often preclude use of other more conventional access sites.\r"

With HPD dose and light intensity constant at 7.5 mg/kg and 100 mW/cm2, respectively, the extent of tumor necrosis was strongly dependent on duration of light exposure. There was no substantial difference in results for 30- and 60-minute treatment durations between animals injected with HPD 2 and 4 days before treatment. After 30 minutes treatment time, responses were seen in 8 of 10 mice (2 days post-HPD) and 11 of 12 mice (4 days post-HPD). After 60 minutes treatment time, toxicity was high. We conclude that, in this model, PDT is effective in selective killing of HNSC. For future comparison studies in this model, if the indicated HPD dose and light intensity are used we recommend a 2-day delay after HPD injection and a light exposure duration of 30 minutes.\r"

The list of autogenous, homologous, heterologous, and alloplastic materials is extensive. All implantable materials have one or more classical principal drawbacks: shrinkage, extrusion, infection, absorption, and/or deformation. One of the major mechanisms of graft unacceptability is the phenomenon of tissue immunity and graft rejection. This has traditionally been the major disadvantage of homografts and heterografts. The host's immune system recognizes the implant as \"non-self,\" an antibody-antigen reaction is triggered--usually by the antigenic stimulation provided by the proteinaceous component of the graft, and the implant is rejected or destroyed. Conversely, autogenous grafts experience the problem of resorption by the action of macrophages and chronic inflammatory cells. The immunologic sterility of alloplastic grafts is an advantage, but the body often rejects even the most inert materials by the process of chronic inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "87230387\r", 
  ".W": "The murine monoclonal antibody (A9), raised to the human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell-line UM-SCC-1, defines a squamous cell antigen associated with aggressive biologic behavior of SCC cell lines in vivo and in vitro. In the present investigation, A9 antigen was detected in tissue sections from 37 consecutive, previously untreated patients with SCC of the head and neck. All tumors were positive for A9 binding, although three distinct patterns (reflecting different intensities of A9 expression) were identified. The intensity of A9 expression was independent of primary tumor site, tumor differentiation, keratinization, or growth pattern. The frequency of high expression (Pattern 1) grew with increasing T class, N class, and tumor stage, and was associated with loss of blood group expression in the tumor and with low levels of lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor. Strong A9 expression had a statistically significant association with low nuclear grade (i.e., tumors with more mature and fewer enlarged nuclei, P = 0.019), low vascular/stromal response (i.e., patchy response rather than continuous, P = 0.014), and impaired in vitro lymphokine production by peripheral blood leukocytes (P = 0.0011). Of greatest interest, however, was the strong association of high A9 expression with shortened disease-free interval (DFI) (P = 0.085) and survival (P = 0.081) relative to patients with weak A9 tumor staining (Patterns 2 and 3). Similarly, the loss of blood group antigen expression was strongly associated with decreased DFI (P = 0.038) and survival (P = 0.062). While neither Pattern 1 A9 expression nor loss of blood group reach statistical significance in prediction of survival, the combination of Pattern 1 A9 expression and loss of blood group expression in primary tumors was significantly associated, both with decreased disease-free interval (P = 0.017) and with decreased overall survival (P = 0.011) (median length of follow-up = 22 months). The length of follow-up (LFU) ranged from 2 to 38 months, with a median LFU of 22 months. While the number of patients (37) is small, the significant association between the expression of these cell-surface markers with relapse and survival indicates that immunohistologic staining of the primary tumor will be an important prognostic indicator useful in identification of individual patients at greatest risk of recurrence or early death from head and neck cancer, independent of tumor size, site, or stage at presentation. These markers may thus provide means of selecting patients who should receive adjuvant therapy and more intensive monitoring for the early detection of recurrent disease.\r"

Computed tomography revealed erosive changes within the jugular fossa that were characteristic of a glomus jugulare tumor; in two cases, a significant posterior fossa extension was documented. The intraoperative findings failed to suggest a lesion different from paraganglioma in two of the cases; in the remaining case, the erosion of both bone and dura was diffuse and more suggestive of a malignant neoplasm. A discussion of the clinical behavior of adenocarcinomas of the middle ear is included in order to emphasize the importance of differentiating these lesions preoperatively from the more commonly encountered paragangliomas.\r"

  ".W": "Vestibular symptoms commonly occur in migraine, and episodic vertigo is most frequently seen. Auditory symptoms also occur, but are less common. When Bickerstaff described basilar artery migraine in 1961, he postulated that the many different symptoms were caused by basilar artery ischemia. He documented that neuro-otologic and other symptoms could occur before or during a migraine headache; others later established that these symptoms could also occur during the headache-free period. Case histories of eleven patients with basilar artery migraine are presented in detail. All met the diagnostic criteria for migraine and experienced vertigo before or during episodic headaches--sometimes with other symptoms of transient brainstem dysfunction. Cases represented both typical and unusual manifestations of migraine with vestibular symptoms: four patients were adolescents, three were more than 45 years old and had previously diagnosed migraine headaches, and four were young adults not previously known to have migraine. Many of the patients were thought to have disorders of the vestibular end organ (sometimes in addition to migraine) and three had undergone previous endolymphatic sac decompressions or perilymph fistula repairs. Diagnostic criteria are reviewed, in order that patients with basilar artery migraine can be distinguished from those with peripheral labyrinthine disease, to allow initiation of appropriate antimigraine therapy and avoidance of unnecessary medical and surgical therapy for end-organ disorders.\r"

  ".W": "As has been reported previously, head and neck carcinomas produce low molecular weight factors (H/N ca LMWFs); a molecular weight less than 25000 daltons is capable of inhibiting the chemotaxis of mononuclear phagocytes. The effect of the factors could be neutralized by antibodies to P15E, one of the structural envelope proteins of Murine Leukemia Viruses (MuLV). This indicates that these low molecular weight factors derived from the tumors are related to P15E. In this study, 35 biopsy specimens of head and neck carcinomas were subjected to an indirect immunoperoxidase assay, in order for P15E-like material to be detected morphologically. All head and neck carcinomas gave positive results. Sixty-three percent of other carcinomas (used as controls) were positive as well. P15E-like material was also expressed in epithelia-overlaying inflammatory responses. Healthy epithelia were not positive. This report thus supports the view that P15E-like molecules can be easily detected in cancerous disease--not only by way of biologic isolation, but also by use of immunohistochemical techniques. Since the factor is not specific for the malignant state, it cannot be used as a tumor marker. Possibly involved in the pathogenesis of cancerous disease, its relationship to growth factors, oncogenes, and the immune system needs further clarification.\r"

Most hospitals still use high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning as their major imaging modality. Although numerous articles point to the improved diagnostic uses of MRI--as compared to high-resolution CT--a change from high-resolution CT scanning to MRI scanning throughout the United States would cost billions of dollars. We should, therefore, delineate those clinical situations in which magnetic resonance imaging is distinctly superior to high-resolution CT scanning. It is already an accepted fact that MRI provides improved imaging of the central nervous system, but, while recent articles maintain the superiority of MRI head and neck imaging, the advantages to the clinician are less clear. We present representative cases of large malignant tumors of the frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses, in which the full extent of the disease which involved intracranial structures and the orbit was better defined on the MRI scan than it was on the high-resolution CT scan. Decisions concerning the involvement of the infratemporal fossa, the cavernous sinus, the optic chiasm, the pituitary, and the frontal lobes were more easily made when based upon magnetic resonance imaging, while the tumor involvement as evaluated by CT scanning was much less clear. Establishment of the problem regions of the head and neck--when magnetic resonance imaging is superior to high-resolution CT scanning--will assist in identification of the true need for this tool in the practice of the otolaryngologist--head and neck surgeon.\r"

The nasolabial cyst is often unrecognized or confused with other intranasal masses, or fissural and odontogenic cysts. Infection of these lesions--which occurred in 50% of the patients--may mimic facial cellulitis, periodontal abscess, acute maxillary sinusitis, or nasal furuncles. This cyst is considered to be a hamartoma because of its developmental origin from entrapped epithelium in an embryonic fusion plane. Simple aspiration invariably leads to recurrence, and complete surgical excision is the accepted treatment. The nasolabial cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intranasal masses, midface infections, and swelling in the nasolabial area.\r"

Pulmonary stretch receptor stimulation by veratridine alkaloid and progressive lung inflation in open-chest cats also produced a vasodilatation of the nasal mucosa. These reflexes were abolished by sectioning the vagus nerves. These results suggest a reflex arc between the lung and nasal capacitance vessels which arises from pulmonary stretch receptors.\r"

To our knowledge, we report the largest number of patients (69) with head and neck primary carcinomas to be studied by DNA flow cytometry. In the first part of this study, we reviewed 109 consecutive patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal primary carcinomas which were treated at North Carolina Memorial Hospital during the period of 1981 to 1984. The final analysis comprised 139 DNA histograms (mean coefficient of variation: 8.02) on paraffin-embedded specimens from 48 patients. Of the 48 patients with primary carcinomas, 24 had glottic, 18 had supraglottic, and 6 had carcinomas from the piriform sinus. Patients had follow-up for a minimum of 12 months, with a mean follow-up period of 23 months. Twenty-three of the 48 primary carcinomas (48%) were clearly aneuploid, and the remaining 52% were tetraploid (22%) or diploid (30%). We have concluded that patients with clearly aneuploid primary carcinomas had significantly better prognoses than those with diploid tumors (p = 0.008). High DNA amounts (greater than 40% of cells beyond the diploid peak, DNA G1G0) also correlated with a favorable prognosis when compared with low DNA amounts (p less than 0.01), and this remained significant when the clinical outcome was adjusted for staging of the primary site (T), nodal status, and stage of disease. Ploidy was the most significant prognostic variable for the laryngeal group of patients. In the second part of the study, twenty-one patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas were studied in a similar fashion as the group with laryngeal carcinomas. In this group, a low DNA amount, with 40% as the cutoff point, was associated with a favorable prognosis (p = 0.024), and this remained significant while controlling for T, nodal status, and stage of disease. Numbers were too small to permit evaluation of the impact of ploidy in this group, but there was a slight trend toward aneuploidy and tetraploidy, correlating with a poor treatment outcome (p = 0.228). DNA amount was the most significant prognostic variable for the group of patients with oral cavity carcinomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In four cases (1.3%), the diagnosis at permanent section changed from one category of benign tumor to another, and in five cases (1.7%), from one category of malignant tumor to another. In four tumors, a frozen section diagnosis of benign was changed to malignant on permanent sectioning; all four involved acinic cell carcinomas. Only two tumors were incorrectly diagnosed as malignant. We conclude that diagnoses of most salivary gland lesions based on frozen section examination are reliable and accurate. However, the literature does indicate that caution should be exercised when malignant tumors are dealt with.\r"

Forty-eight percent of posterior ethmoid cells are separated from the optic nerve by the thin bony lamina of the optic canal. Nearly 90% of sphenoid sinuses contact the ipsilateral optic nerve and 10% contact both nerves. Eight percent of posterior ethmoid cells override the ipsilateral sphenoid sinus and contact the optic nerve on that side. Paraxial reformatted displays allowed estimation of the degree of projection of the optic nerve into adjacent sinus cavities. Three percent of optic nerves have significant projection into the posterior ethmoid cell, and 23% project significantly into the sphenoid sinus. The width of the bony plate that separates the optic nerve from the sinus cavity was the same for sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses. Although sinus pneumatization varies among individuals, right and left sides are generally similar within one person.\r"

The averaged estimate of cochlear blood flow in chickens is 0.75 microliter/min. Variability in these data from chickens is similar to that reported from mammals. A potentially important but puzzling observation is an inverse relationship between blood flow to the cochlea and to the brain. The ease of cochlear extraction makes chickens ideal models for study of cochlear blood flow.\r"

This project attempts to better define safe parameters of electrical stimulation of the inner ear and compare the safe limits of intracochlear vs. extracochlear stimulation sites. Guinea pigs were implanted with single electrodes either on the promontory or in the scala tympani and were stimulated relative to a remote indifferent for 12 hours distributed over a 4-week period. Electrical auditory brainstem evoked responses (EABRs) were tested before and after each of four 3-hour stimulation sessions. Six weeks after implantation, the animals were killed, and their cochleas were examined under the scanning electron microscope. Intracochlear electrodes exhibited thresholds for damage well below one half of that found for most extracochlear stimulation sites. The function-relating damage threshold (in amperes) to frequency of intracochlear stimulation is represented by two straight lines, with an intercept of 1 kHz. The low-frequency limb exhibited a slope of 3 to 4 dB/octave, whereas the high-frequency limb exhibited a slope of 9 to 10 dB/octave. Extracochlear results were too variable to permit speculation. Changes in EABRs were only variably related to histopathologic findings.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to investigate how long the abnormal behaviour pattern continues, and whether the observed increased scratching behaviour is a parameter of chronic pain or rather a reaction to itch. Adjuvant-induced arthritic rats were observed for up to 180 days after the inoculation and their behaviour was quantitatively analysed. The following behavioural changes persisted for more than 60 days: rearing, running and climbing were decreased while grooming, scratching, biting and freezing were increased. No behavioural changes were observed 120 days after the inoculation. The increased scratching was not influenced by an antihistamine drug (astemizole). Not only morphine but also acetylsalicylate selectively depressed the increased scratching behaviour without influencing the other behaviours. These results reinforce the notion that in arthritic rats the increased scratching is a sign of chronic pain.\r"

Significant differences were noted between the delayed and nondelayed groups for gestational age, presence of severe respiratory distress syndrome, and the time of the first enteral feeding. In very low birth weight infants, delay in the passage of the first stool is a common occurrence. This delay is probably due to physiologic immaturity of the motor mechanisms of the gut, lack of triggering effect of enteral feeds on gut hormones, and the presence of severe respiratory distress syndrome, which may singly or in concert adversely affect gastrointestinal motility.\r"

The disparity in charges for outliers and inliers (not exceeding the \"trim point\") is even more dramatic. Newborns with \"extreme immaturity\" (DRG 386) and \"prematurity with major problems\" (DRG 387) together accounted for less than 3% of all newborn discharges but for nearly one fourth of all outlier discharges. The mean length of stay in hospitals for outliers in those two DRGs was more than 2 months. The mean charge per outlier discharge in DRG 386 was $27,061 in 1981. Nearly one third of the discharges and more than two thirds of the days of care in this DRG were for outliers. Outliers occurred up to five times more often among premature neonates than among normal newborns and occurred preponderantly in teaching hospitals, especially those with more than 400 beds. This finding may require a reevaluation of the outlier trim points and the reimbursement method for newborn DRGs to assure adequate payment to the providers of neonatal intensive care, mainly large teaching hospitals.\r"

  ".W": "Very low birth weight infants have little storage of hepatic retinol and are, therefore, highly dependent upon an exogenous supply. The recent association between low serum retinol level and bronchopulmonary dysplasia and the persistently low serum levels of retinol during total parenteral nutrition prompted a prospective study to evaluate serial changes in serum retinol levels during 1 month of total parenteral nutrition (retinol dose 455 micrograms/d) and again during 1 month of total enteral feeding (retinol dose 200 to 300 micrograms/d) in the same infants. Infants were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of infants weighing less than 1,000 g (n = 24) and group 2 consisted of infants weighing 1,000 to 1,500 g (n = 17). Although initial mean levels of retinol were similar in both groups (14.8 +/- 0.9 and 13.5 +/- 0.7 micrograms/dL), there was wide variation between infants. In group 1 infants, there was a significant (P less than .01) decline in retinol level by the second week of life (to 9.2 +/- 1 micrograms/dL), which persisted during total parenteral nutrition, but increased to 13.4 +/- 2 after 1 week of enteral feeding. This level was maintained throughout enteral feeding. In group 2 infants, there was no significant change in serum retinol level throughout the study. During total parenteral nutrition, several infants had retinol levels below 10 micrograms/dL, a level associated with signs of retinol deficiency in older children. Because losses of retinol are known to occur in smaller volume total parenteral nutrition solutions, it was speculated that losses of retinol in our patients were due to retinol losses in the total parenteral nutrition delivery system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their ages when first seen ranged from 2 weeks to 4 years with a mean of 19 months. In three of the patients, the hemangiomas remained small for many months and then suddenly enlarged and hemorrhagic diatheses appeared. The duration of the thrombocytopenia ranged from 5 to 20 months, a time span that in some of the patients was influenced by the type of treatment used. Each patient received a variety of therapies including the following: medications to control the coagulopathy; mechanical, cytolytic, and pharmacologic treatment to eradicate the lesion; and blood product support with platelets and cryoprecipitate for severe bleeding. A prompt elevation of the platelet count occurred in three of the patients after the lesion was biopsied. Subtotal resection of the lesion resulted in an immediate increase of the platelet count in one patient. A transient increase in platelet counts and fibrinogen levels was observed in another patient following several embolizations of a portion of the hemangioma. Other modes of therapy were difficult to evaluate, especially because the same therapy applied at different times in the same patient effected a different type of response. Eventually, all of the patients experienced resolution of their lesions and, with this, concomitant reversal of the coagulopathy.\r"

  ".U": "87231870\r", 
  ".W": "In the rod outer segments (ROS) of bovine retina, light activation of phospholipase A2 has been shown to occur by a transducin-dependent mechanism. In this report, the transducin-mediated stimulation of phospholipase A2 is shown to require dissociation of the alpha beta gamma heterotrimer. Addition of transducin to dark-adapted transducin-poor ROS stimulated phospholipase A2 activity only with coincident exposure to white light or, in the dark, with addition of the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog, guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma-S]). Both light and GTP[gamma-S] induced dissociation of the transducin subunits and led to severalfold increases in the phospholipase A2 activity of transducin-rich, but not transducin-poor, ROS. In contrast, pertussis toxin treatment of transducin, which stabilizes the associated state of this G protein, prevented the stimulation of phospholipase A2 by exogenous transducin in the presence of light. Addition of purified transducin subunits to dark-adapted transducin-poor ROS revealed that phospholipase A2 stimulation occurred by action of the beta gamma subunits. This is in contrast to the transducin-mediated increase in cGMP phosphodiesterase activity, where activation occurs by action of the alpha subunit. The alpha subunit, which itself slightly stimulated phospholipase A2 activity, inhibited the beta gamma-induced stimulation of phospholipase A2. This inhibition appears to be the result of subunit reassociation since addition of GTP[gamma-S] abolished the inhibitory effect of the alpha subunit on the beta gamma-induced increase in phospholipase A2, while pertussis toxin treatment of the subunits further inhibited phospholipase A2 activity. Modulation of phospholipase A2 activity by the transducin subunit is, therefore, a mode of action for these subunits in signal transduction.\r"

  ".U": "87231878\r", 
  ".W": "The expression in human fibroblasts of the beta 2-interferon (IFN-beta 2) gene, which is now recognized to be identical to the gene encoding B-cell differentiation factor BSF-2, is enhanced by several cytokines that affect cell growth (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, platelet-derived growth factor, and beta 1-interferon). We have examined the possibility that IFN-beta 2 gene expression is regulated through activation, by diacylglycerol, of the protein kinase C pathway. The synthetic diacylglycerols 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (diC8) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol strongly enhanced IFN-beta 2, but not IFN-beta 1, gene expression in human fibroblasts (FS-4 strain). An increase in IFN-beta 2 mRNA level was detected within 15 min after addition of diC8 (290 microM) to FS-4 cells and was maximal approximately 20 hr later. An increase in IFN-beta 2 gene transcription was detected within 5 min of addition of diC8, and the rate of transcription was near-maximal by 15-30 min. The enhancement of IFN-beta 2 gene expression by diC8, interleukin 1, or tumor necrosis factor was not prevented by H8, a preferential inhibitor of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, but was blocked by H7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C as well as of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. diC8 was found to protect FS-4 cells from the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus; this protection was blocked by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies that neutralize IFN-beta, suggesting that the antiviral effect was due to the secretion of IFN-beta 2 by the diC8-treated fibroblasts. The calcium ionophore A23187 (1-10 microM) also elicited an increase in the level of IFN-beta 2 mRNA in FS-4 fibroblasts; appropriate combinations of A23187 and diC8 had at least an additive effect in enhancing IFN-beta 2 mRNA levels. These results show that protein kinase C-activating or [Ca2+]-elevating agents rapidly increase the expression of the IFN-beta 2 gene in human fibroblasts.\r"

By using cloned DNA probes, we have characterized the following five different partial deletions of the factor VIII gene from a panel of 83 patients with hemophilia A: (i) a 7-kilobase (kb) deletion that eliminates exon 6; (ii) a 2.5-kb deletion that eliminates 5' sequences of exon 14; (iii) a deletion of at least 7 kb that eliminates exons 24 and 25; (iv) a deletion of at least 16 kb that eliminates exons 23-25; and (v) a 5.5-kb deletion that eliminates exon 22. The first four deletions are associated with severe hemophilia A. By contrast, the last deletion is associated with moderate disease, possibly because of in-frame splicing from moderate disease, possibly because of in-frame splicing from adjacent exons. None of those patients with partial gene deletions had circulating inhibitors to factor VIII. One deletion occurred de novo in a germ cell of the maternal grandmother, while a second deletion occurred in a germ cell of the maternal grandfather. These observations demonstrate that de novo deletions of X-linked genes can occur in either male or female gametes.\r"

A human embryonic kidney cell line, 293, was used as the eukaryotic host. The target gene for mutation analysis, supF, codes for a tyrosine suppressor tRNA and is strategically located between the origin of replication of the plasmid in Escherichia coli and the gene for a selectable marker, so that the possibility of recovering supF mutants containing gross rearrangements is low. The frequency of supF mutants obtained when untreated plasmid replicated in 293 cells was 1.4 X 10(-4). The frequency with BPDE-treated plasmid increased linearly as a function of the number of adducts, with 16 adducts per plasmid giving 38 X 10(-4). Polyacrylamide gel and agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of 137 plasmids with mutations in the supF gene indicated that 70% (21/30) from untreated plasmids contained deletions or insertions or showed altered gel mobility, whereas only 28% (30/107) of those derived from BPDE-treated plasmids contained such alterations. Of the 86 unequivocally independent mutants derived from BPDE-treated plasmids that were analyzed by sequencing, the majority (60/86) exhibited base substitutions. Mutants exhibiting frameshifts (insertions or deletions of one, two, or four base pairs) were also found, but they were a minority (11/86). In the progeny of BPDE-treated plasmids 61/71 base substitutions observed were transversions, with 45/61 G X C----T X A. Examination of the location of BPDE-induced mutations among the 85 base pairs in the structure of the tRNA revealed that 30% of the base substitutions occurred at two sites and 44% of the rest occurred at five other hot spots. Only 20% of all these base changes involved a site in which a guanine containing a BPDE adduct is predicted to be labile--i.e., a guanine that has a pyrimidine to its 5' side.\r"

  ".W": "Two distinct beta subunits of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins have been identified by cDNA cloning and are referred to as beta 1 and beta 2 subunits. The bovine transducin beta subunit (beta 1) has been cloned previously. We have now isolated and analyzed cDNA clones that encode the beta 2 subunit from bovine adrenal, bovine brain, and a human myeloid leukemia cell line, HL-60. The 340-residue Mr 37,329 beta 2 protein is 90% identical with beta 1 in predicted amino acid sequence, and it is also organized as a series of repetitive homologous segments. The major mRNA that encodes the bovine beta 2 subunit is 1.7 kilobases in length. It is expressed at lower levels than beta 1 subunit mRNA in all tissues examined. The beta 1 and beta 2 messages are expressed in cloned human cell lines. Hybridization of cDNA probes to bovine DNA showed that beta 1 and beta 2 are encoded by separate genes. The amino acid sequences for the bovine and human beta 2 subunit are identical, as are the amino acid sequences for the bovine and human beta 1 subunit. This evolutionary conservation suggests that the two beta subunits have different roles in the signal transduction process.\r"

TCR gamma lymphocytes express arrays of T3 polypeptides distinct from those typically observed on TCR alpha beta lymphocytes. This report demonstrates that identical T3 gamma, delta, and epsilon polypeptides are synthesized by TCR gamma lymphocytes and TCR alpha beta lymphocytes. However, the processing of T3 delta oligosaccharides is distinct in the two cell types. This observation may suggest distinct quaternary structures of these receptor complexes. Despite these structural differences, the T3 molecule on TCR gamma lymphocytes is functional. It is associated with and comodulates with TCR gamma and it serves as a substrate for protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation. Anti-T3 monoclonal antibodies induce a rapid increase in cytoplasmic free calcium, indicating that the receptor complex is involved in signal transduction and triggering of TCR gamma lymphocytes.\r"

Exposing the skin to low doses of UV radiation (280-320 nm) before the application of FITC suppresses the contact hypersensitivity response to FITC. Cells present in the draining lymph nodes of these mice induce suppressor T lymphocytes when injected into normal recipients. The inducer cells in the draining lymph nodes are Thy 1+, Ia- and are inactivated by gamma-radiation. These studies demonstrate that different mechanisms are involved in the in vivo activation of effector and suppressor immune responses, and they suggest that the mode of initial antigen presentation determines which immunologic circuit will be activated in response to a contact-sensitizing antigen.\r"

The complement of this sequence, in the reverse orientation, is found at an identical location in light-chain variable-region genes. This sequence element is thought to be involved in the lymphoid-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes. Analysis of nuclear extracts from both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells in a gel migration inhibition assay, using an immunoglobulin promoter region fragment containing the octamer, reveals multiple migration-retarded species that represent specific DNA-protein complexes. The number and relative level of these complexes vary with cell type; some complexes are detected with all extracts, whereas one complex is lymphoid-specific and may represent an interaction involved in the lymphoid-restricted expression of immunoglobulin genes. Mitogenic stimulation of a B-lymphoid line can increase the level of the protein responsible for this lymphoid-specific complex. Analysis of the complexes detected in the gel migration inhibition assay by DNase I protection (\"footprinting\") has revealed that all of these DNA-protein complexes involve contact of the protein with the nucleotides of the octamer. One complex, present in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells, displays an additional DNA-protein contact adjacent to the octamer. Our results also indicate that the interaction of proteins with the octameric sequence can cause a local alteration in the structure of the DNA helix.\r"

These cells express the CD3 complex but they do not carry the classical T-cell receptor (TCR)-alpha/-beta heterodimer on their surface (WT31- CD3+). Instead, they express a TCR-gamma chain associated with another type of polypeptide termed TCR-delta. We report here that a T-cell clone with natural killer (NK)-like activity, WM-14, had a disulfide bridged TCR-gamma homodimer associated with CD3 on its surface. The TCR-gamma chains of WM-14 cells were present in three different glycosylation forms of 43, 40, and 38 kDa, but they appeared to contain the same polypeptide backbone. Since cytotoxicity by WM-14 could be inhibited by anti-CD3 antibodies, we concluded that the TCR-gamma-CD3 complex was involved in the NK-like unrestricted killer activity. Although normal CD3-gamma, CD3-delta, and CD3-epsilon chains were present in this clone, the association with the TCR-gamma homodimer may be the cause of a complete processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides attached to the CD3-delta chain.\r"

Thus O2 prevents induction of nitrate, fumarate, and Me3NO reductases, and nitrate curtails the induction of fumarate and Me3NO reductases. Under anaerobic conditions the narL gene product, in the presence of nitrate, is known to activate transcription of the narC operon, which encodes nitrate reductase. This study shows that the same product plays a role in the repression by nitrate of the operons (frd and tor) that encode fumarate and Me3NO reductases. In contrast, the anaerobic repression of ethanol dehydrogenase by nitrate does not require the narL product. Expression of narL does not require the fnr gene product, a pleiotropic activator that is required for full expression of narC, frd, and tor.\r"

In vitro, cleavage requires activated RecA at neutral pH and proceeds spontaneously at alkaline pH. These two cleavage reactions have similar specificities, suggesting that RecA acts indirectly to stimulate self-cleavage, rather than directly as a protease. We have studied the chemical mechanism of cleavage by using site-directed mutagenesis to change selected amino acid residues in LexA, chosen on the basis of kinetic data, homology to other cleavable repressors, and potential similarity of the mechanism to that of proteases. Serine-119 and lysine-156 were changed to alanine, a residue with an unreactive side chain, resulting in two mutant proteins that had normal repressor function and apparently normal structure, but were completely deficient in both types of cleavage reaction. Serine-119 was also changed to cysteine, another residue with a nucleophilic side chain, resulting in a protein that was cleaved at a significant rate. These and other observations suggest that hydrolysis of the scissile peptide bond proceeds by a mechanism similar to that of serine proteases, with serine-119 being a nucleophile and lysine-156 being an activator. Possible roles for RecA are discussed.\r"

Cell budding and proliferation are reinitiated upon addition of nonlimiting ergosterol or cholesterol with trace ergosterol, whereas cholesterol or trace ergosterol alone is less effective. Stimulation of a protein kinase associated with immune complexes of yeast protein and anti-pp60v-src shows a positive correlation with exit from the G1 phase following ergosterol addition. Ergosterol-stimulated cells also demonstrate an increase in phosphatidylinositol kinase activity.

Aggregates of PrP 27-30 form insoluble amyloid rods that resist dissociation by nondenaturing detergents. Mixtures of the detergent cholate and phospholipids were found to solubilize purified PrP 27-30 in the form of detergent-lipid-protein complexes. Removal of the cholate by dialysis resulted in the formation of closed liposomes. Both the detergent-lipid-protein complexes and the liposomes often but not always exhibited a 10-fold increase in scrapie infectivity compared to that observed with the rods. No evidence for a prion-associated nucleic acid could be found when the phospholipid vesicles containing PrP 27-30 were digested with nucleases and Zn2+ under conditions that allowed hydrolysis of exogenously added nucleic acids. No filamentous or rod-shaped particles were found amongst prion liposomes by electron microscopy in our search for a putative filamentous \"scrapie virus.\" The partitioning of PrP 27-30 and scrapie infectivity into phospholipid vesicles contends that PrP 27-30 has a central role in scrapie pathogenesis, establishes that the prion amyloid rods are not essential for infectivity, and argues that prions are fundamentally different from viruses.\r"

Replacement of the infC promoter with the trp promoter deletes 120 nucleotides of the infC mRNA 5' to the translation initiation site without affecting autogenous translational control. Mutation of the unusual AUU initiator codon of infC to the more common AUG initiator codon abolishes translation initiation factor IF3-dependent repression and derepression of infC expression in vivo.

  ".U": "87231948\r", 
  ".W": "Bacteriophage lambda integration and excision take place at specific loci called attachment sites. Earlier work has shown that efficient recombination requires the identical sequence to be present in both attachment sites throughout the seven-base-pair region between the points of strand exchange. A plausible model for the role of homology postulates that Int, the site-specific recombinase, makes double-strand breaks at attachment sites such that each broken end has a short single-strand protrusion. Recombination would then depend upon the capacity of these protrusions to form Watson-Crick helices--i.e., to anneal--a process that might require perfect complementarity between the cohesive ends. To test this model, we have studied Int-promoted crosses in which one attachment site is a heteroduplex. Specifically, we constructed sites in which the seven-base-pair region between the points of strand exchange contains one or more noncomplementary pairs. The double-strand break and annealing mechanism predicts that crosses with these heteroduplex sites should yield one completed recombinant and one broken site. We find that such nonreciprocal recombination is uncommon and that the typical outcome of crosses involving a heteroduplex site is a reciprocal recombinant in which both products are resealed. Moreover, the occasional appearance of nonreciprocal products can be explained by our finding that Int can cleave heteroduplex attachment sites after recombination is completed. Taken together, our data strongly indicate that bacteriophage lambda recombination does not proceed by the homology-dependent annealing of cohesive ends; acceptable alternatives for the role of homology are discussed.\r"

Exposure of the follicles to mammalian gonadotropins elicited a current generated largely by an increase in membrane K+ conductance. The gonadotropin response resembled responses elicited by adenosine and catecholamines in the same follicle, but was not blocked by purinergic or catecholaminergic antagonists. The gonadotropin-induced currents were potentiated by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and by phosphodiesterase inhibitors; similar currents were elicited in the same follicle by intraoocyte injection of cAMP, which indicates a role for this second messenger in the response mechanism. Gonadotropin responses were either abolished or substantially reduced after treatments that remove the ovarian epithelial and follicular cells. Our experiments suggest that the gonadotropin receptors, and the K+ channels they regulate, reside in the follicular cells.\r"

However, the presence of chromosome 6 in hamster-human hybrids is by itself insufficient to confer sensitivity to human immune interferon as measured by the induction of human HLA. Human chromosome 21 was found to be the second chromosome essential for HLA inducibility. Similar results were found with mouse-human somatic cell hybrids. Thus, at least two steps are involved in the action of human interferon gamma: the binding of interferon gamma to its receptor coded by chromosome 6 and the linkage of this binding event through a factor coded by chromosome 21 to trigger biological action. Both of these steps are species-specific.\r"

This linker, which contains a BamHI restriction site, will create a HindIII restriction site when ligated to the 3' end of cDNA fragments. Subsequent treatment of methylated cDNA with HindIII and BamHI endonucleases allows these fragments to be cloned directionally into lambda ORF8. To demonstrate the utility of this cloning system, we prepared a library from 5 micrograms of mRNA isolated from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The primary library contained 2 X 10(8) plaque-forming phage, at least 80% of which contain inserts. A portion of the library was examined for the presence of gamma-interferon-related clones to verify the method had generated a library that was representative of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. This simple and efficient cDNA cloning system significantly reduces the amount of RNA and effort required for the preparation of large directionally cloned libraries.\r"

  ".W": "There are at least two forms of cellular receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2); one with a very high affinity and the other with a lower affinity. We identified a non-Tac IL-2 binding peptide with a relative molecular weight of 75,000 (p75). Cell lines bearing either the p55 Tac or the p75 peptide alone manifested low-affinity IL-2 binding, whereas a cell line bearing both peptides manifested both high- and low-affinity receptors. After the internalization of labeled IL-2 through high-affinity receptors, the p75 peptide could not be detected by cross-linking studies. Furthermore, fusion of cell membranes from low-affinity IL-2 binding cell lines bearing the Tac peptide alone with membranes from a cell line bearing the p75 peptide alone generated hybrid membranes bearing high-affinity receptors. These results suggest a multichain model for the high-affinity IL-2 receptor in which high-affinity receptors would be expressed when both Tac and p75 IL-2 binding peptides are present and associated in a receptor complex.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a foreign unrearranged immunoglobulin gene can be functionally rearranged and expressed in vivo, a rabbit b9 kappa light chain gene construct containing a single germ-line kappa chain variable (V) region gene (V kappa), the five kappa chain joining (J) segments (J kappa), and the kappa chain constant (C) region germ-line gene (C kappa) was introduced into fertilized mouse eggs. Eleven transgenic mice carrying 1-30 copies of the rabbit kappa gene construct were obtained. Rearrangement of the transgene due to V kappa-J kappa recombination was observed in the spleen of all the mice lines analyzed. Only the J kappa 1 and J kappa 2 segments, which have canonical sequences for rearrangement and high-level expression, are utilized in assembly of the rabbit gene. V kappa-J kappa 1 and V kappa-J kappa 2 joining was also observed in the thymus but not in nonlymphoid tissue. Polyadenylylated rabbit kappa chain transcripts of 1.2 kilobases were found in the spleen of the transgenic mice. The level of transcription was low despite a high level of rearrangement. Three transgenic mice lines secreted kappa light chains encoded by the foreign rabbit gene. Serum rabbit kappa chains were associated with mouse mu and gamma 1 heavy chains. However, hybrid antibody molecules containing both rabbit and mouse kappa light chains were also found in the serum of these animals. These results suggest that, although the rabbit kappa chain gene construct contains the necessary sequences for gene assembly, sequences implicated in stage- and tissue-specific regulation of kappa chain gene rearrangement are either missing or not recognized by mouse lymphoid cells.\r"

One of these monoclonal antibodies recognized a polypeptide of 18 kDa. This glycoprotein was purified by monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity chromatography and a polyclonal antiserum was prepared against it. Immunofluorescence assays showed that the polyclonal antiserum bound to the surface of newly transformed schistosomula and lung-stage organisms but not to the surface of liver-stage and adult worms. Using this polyclonal antiserum we isolated recombinant clones from an adult worm cDNA expression library constructed in lambda gt11. Clone 654.2 contained an insert of 0.52 kilobase and hybridized to a 1.2-kilobase mRNA species from adult worms. Most importantly, clone 654.2 produced a fusion protein of 125 kDa that was reactive with sera of vaccinated mice that are capable of transferring resistance. This result encourages future vaccination trials with the fusion protein.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a macrophage product under active study as an anticancer drug. However, this agent can be very toxic and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of endotoxic shock. After intravenous injection of human recombinant TNF (4 micrograms/g), growing rats showed an unusual constellation of physiological responses, and all died within 2-4 hr. In 1 hr, TNF caused a sharp fall (2.5 degrees C) in body temperature and a large increase in plasma prostaglandin E2 levels. Blood glucose initially increased, but then a profound hypoglycemia developed by 2 hr. The TNF-treated animals also showed diarrhea, cyanosis, and a severe metabolic acidosis. A single injection of the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin or ibuprofen before the TNF treatment completely prevented the rapid killing and reduced eventual lethality by 70%. These agents blocked prostaglandin E2 production and prevented the hypothermia, changes in blood glucose, acidosis, and other symptoms. Since similar physiological changes have been reported after endotoxin injection, our data support the suggestion that TNF production is a critical factor in the development of septic shock. These findings also indicate that increased production of prostaglandins or thromboxanes is important in endotoxic shock and argue that cyclooxygenase inhibitors should be useful in its therapy. Indomethacin did not block the cytotoxic effects of TNF in vitro on several transformed cell lines (HeLa, Me 180, or L929). Therefore, combined use of TNF with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor may allow safer administration of high doses of this polypeptide to cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "Primate renins (human and monkey) are very similar. We used pure human renin to immunize marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and thereby produce a chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensinogen reaction. After a control period of 2 months, five male marmosets, on their usual sodium-poor diet, were immunized against pure human renin by three subcutaneous injections of 30 micrograms each, with complete and then incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Three marmosets were injected with adjuvant only and served as controls. Blood sampling and blood pressure measurements were performed weekly. After the third injection, the five marmosets immunized against renin developed a high titer of renin antibodies (50% binding of 125I-labeled human renin at a dilution of greater than or equal to 1:10,000). The antibodies inhibited the enzymatic activity of both marmoset and human renins. At the same time, systolic blood pressure decreased significantly from 125 +/- 13 mm Hg to 87 +/- 8 mm Hg (mean +/- SD; 1 mm Hg = 133 Pa). Plasma renin enzyme activity was undetectable in three animals. Plasma aldosterone decreased significantly. After 1-4 months with low blood pressure, a normal urinary output, and a normal plasma creatinine, the five marmosets became sick and died within one month. At autopsy an immunological renal disease, characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin and macrophage infiltration colocalized with renin, was found. Granulomatous formations, probably due to Freund's adjuvant, could be seen in the lungs and in the kidney. No immunoglobulin was detectable in extrarenal vessels or in other organs. These experiments demonstrate that, in this primate, a chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system can be achieved by active immunization against homologous renin, but this blockade is associated with the development of an autoimmune disease localized in the kidney.\r"

Sizeable percentages, however, continued to believe after the programs that AIDS could be transmitted by casual contact, such as sharing coffee cups. Provider attitudes about caring for persons with AIDS shifted in the direction desired (P less than .001) on six of nine questions. After programs, 92 percent believed that they had sufficient knowledge to protect themselves from getting AIDS, and 79 percent felt professionally competent to care for a person with AIDS. Both before and after programs, providers who established regulations for the care of persons with AIDS and outpatient care providers had the most accurate knowledge and felt most comfortable with persons with AIDS, while inpatient care providers had the least accurate knowledge and felt least comfortable. A 1-month followup of 159 providers revealed that postprogram changes in knowledge and attitudes were largely retained. Results point to the need for education at all levels of the health care system, to a persistent gap in knowledge and attitudes between those persons who establish regulations and those who carry them out, and to the possibility of creating significant changes through education.\r"

The odds ratios were not substantially changed after adjustment for obesity, parity, and husband's education level. These results suggest that smoking may affect the ovaries or hormone metabolism, or both, with medical and cosmetic consequences.\r"

The series has featured a group of volunteers who are at high risk of diseases because of their unhealthful habits and two health educators who counsel the studio group and the viewers to make changes in health behaviors. The \"Keys to Health 84-85\" was the fifth of the series and consisted of 15 parts, 35 minutes viewing time each. Results of the evaluation surveys, which are presented briefly, indicate that viewing rates were high. Of the countrywide sample, 27 percent of men and 35 percent of women reported that they had viewed at least three parts of the series. Reported changes in behaviors were substantial among the viewers who had seen several parts of the series and were meaningful, overall, for the entire population. Of the countrywide sample, 7.1 percent of smoking viewers reported an attempt to stop smoking--this number was 3.6 percent of all smokers. The percentages of weight loss among viewers and the total population sample were 3.9 for men and 2.1 for women. The reported reductions in fat consumption were 27.2 percent for men and 15.0 percent for women. The reported effects in the demonstration area of North Karelia were even higher, mainly because of higher viewing rates.\r"

These strategies presume the public has sufficient levels of relevant health information, as well as necessary attitudes and skills for the effective use of this information in the management of their own health care. This study tests this assumption as it relates to the level of public knowledge of digestive health and disease, a major health concern affecting an estimated 1 in 10 Americans. This paper reports results of a telephone survey of a representative national sample administered to 1,250 Americans in May 1983 that was designed to assess their level of information about digestive health and disease, comfort in communicating about digestive problems, and preference for health information sources. The results indicate that the American public is largely uninformed and misinformed about digestive health and disease, and they underscore the need for disseminating relevant health information about digestive health and disease to the public to facilitate prevention of digestive health problems and self-management of digestive health care. Health information dissemination is severely complicated by the widespread stigma associated with digestive topics, manifested in the American public's general discomfort in communicating with others about digestive health. These factors necessitate development of sensitive and pervasive digestive health promotion and education programs in the United States.\r"

Hispanic girls were 1 kg heavier (P less than .05) and 0.9 cm taller (not significant) than white girls. There was little difference in growth between Hispanic and white youths. Children were assessed with the use of the Centers for Disease Control's nutritional surveillance cutpoints; less than 5 percent of each ethnic group fell below the fifth percentile, according to the National Center for Health Statistics' weight-for-height standards. White and Hispanic youths were twice as likely as blacks to fall below the 5th percentile for stature or to be overweight (above the 95th percentile for weight-for-height). Compared with black girls, white and Hispanic girls were three to four times more likely to fall below the fifth percentile for stature. The prevalence of short stature was also higher among white girls (15.9 percent) compared with Hispanics (10.3 percent). There was little difference in the prevalence of overweight by ethnic group for girls. These data show that white children from poor communities have decreased growth and suggest that they may be at increased risk of nutritional problems.\r"

In addition, there is considerable opportunity to use these funds creatively in shaping the content of their programs. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health's experience with this block grant is reviewed, showing the grant's critical importance in the department's statewide disease prevention efforts. In order to maximize public health impact, the department has shifted its funding allocations based on explicit criteria.

These health effects cover a broad spectrum of symptoms, including neurophysiological effects, respiratory irritations, and eye and skin irritations. Recent studies have also suggested a possible correlation between exposure to formaldehyde vapors and cancer. In 1979, following hundreds of complaints of adverse health effects from occupants of dwellings insulated with urea formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI), the Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued regulations banning the new installation of UFFI in Massachusetts. New State legislation was adopted in 1986 which reformulated UFFI policy. The law established a minimum concentration of formaldehyde of 0.1 parts per million (ppm) below which removal of the insulation is not required or encouraged. A trust fund financed by industry was established to pay for air testing and for the removal of UFFI from homes if the formaldehyde level exceeds the statutory minimum of 0.1 ppm or if an occupant experiences adverse health effects attributable to the insulation. Based on the Massachusetts experience, these requirements have been identified: the need for flexibility and midcourse corrections in the development of health policy to allow for the incorporation of new scientific information or changes in the economic or political environment, the need for close coordination with all affected parties, and the need for scientific and technical policy development to be joined with economic and political perspectives to ensure smooth implementation of health policies.\r"

The women were asked to report use of Pap smear screening during several time periods, their congruence with recommended medical practice, general use of medical services, and a variety of sociodemographic indicators. A log linear weighted least squares regression model was developed, and it explained 30 percent of the variance in recency of Pap smear screening behavior. While the sociodemographic variables were important predictors in the model, the medical care variables were the strongest predictors of recent Pap smear use.

Most pediatricians had traditional conservative attitudes and opinions (exemplified by the statement \"a woman's place is in the home\") in regard to two factors, \"acceptability of maternal employment\" and \"effects of maternal employment on children.\" More liberal views were associated with more recent graduation from medical school, being a woman, having a working wife, being in favor of wife's working status, and knowledge of statistics concerning maternal employment. These results suggest that if the practices of those Texas pediatricians who responded correspond with other pediatricians' practices in the United States, a large proportion of pediatricians may not be providing adequate support for the 17 million working mothers and their children.\r"

  ".W": "Although the potential of school-based programs in the prevention of adolescent pregnancy is well recognized, few have been evaluated. This paper describes the use of a reproductive health care clinic associated with a school pregnancy prevention program which had demonstrated success. The program operated in one junior and one senior high school in a large city during the 3 school years from 1981 to 1984. Three facets of the 818 users of the program clinic are explored: who enrolled in the clinic, why they enrolled and what contraceptive methods they received, and their continuation with the clinic. Chi-square analysis and Student's t-tests were used to test for significant differences between the two school and sex groups. Life table and regression techniques were employed to examine clinic continuation. The main findings are teens of both sexes used the clinic, and junior high males used it in surprisingly large numbers; there were no major school or sex differences in the characteristics of those who enrolled; most students enrolled to obtain a contraceptive method; although many females served by the clinic had previously used another family planning clinic, the majority of them had unmet needs; the rate of clinic continuation was high; and certain factors contributed to clinic continuation. These findings suggest that a clinic in a school-linked setting can successfully attract students to use its services and it may offer certain advantages for reaching sexually active teens in search of contraceptive protection.\r"

  ".W": "The supply of physicians has increased rapidly during the past decade. To examine the impact of this expanding supply on the geographic distribution of physicians in rural areas, we examined the location patterns of 1974-78 medical school graduates practicing in 1983 in rural areas. Of 2,112 rural counties, 58 percent gained at least one 1974-78 graduate; 31 percent of the least populous rural counties gained physicians; and 92 percent of most populous counties gained physicians. When Health Manpower Shortage Areas were examined separately, it was found that only 45 percent of the HMSAs that consisted of an entire county gained a young physician compared with 61 percent of non-HMSA counties. Characteristics of counties that gained a young physician were compared with characteristics of counties that did not attract a young physician. Results of the multivariate analysis indicated that the probability that a county would attract a young physician is positively related to population, the supply of physicians, the proportion of white collar employment, and the presence of a college. Higher levels of farm population are associated with a lower probability that a county would attract a young physician. These findings suggest that diffusion of young physicians into rural areas is occurring as the supply of physicians increases. However, young physicians are attracted to communities with particular characteristics. Those counties with fewer attractive characteristics may continue to have difficulty gaining physicians to serve their communities.\r"

During 1968-78, white women showed the largest age-adjusted decline of all race-sex groups for hypertension, as white men did for stroke and nonwhite men did for IHD. White men showed the largest age-adjusted decline for all three diseases for 1979-82.

There have been no tumor recurrences with a median 68-month follow-up among seven survivors. The dose usually recommended for treatment of intracranial germinoma is 50-55 Gy. Our data suggest that 45 Gy may be sufficient, if treatment volume is adequate. Posttherapy endocrine testing is also essential.\r"

Twenty-two patients received implants. CT of the middle and inner ear was normal in 24 patients (57.1%) and showed labyrinthine ossification in 12 (28.6%), cochlear or fenestral otosclerosis (or both) in four (9.5%), and congenital cochlear malformation in two (4.8%). The information provided by CT was used to (a) exclude patients in whom multichannel cochlear implantation would most likely be unsuccessful (owing to obliterative labyrinthine ossification, or congenital cochlear malformation, severe cochlear, or fenestral otosclerosis), (b) help select the best ear for implantation, and (c) provide a preoperative picture of normal variants and avoidable surgical pitfalls. MR experience is limited but assessment of the size of the cochlear nerve and the membranous labyrinth is possible with this modality and may provide additional information in the evaluation of these patients.\r"

The aortoplasty was performed with a continuous running suture of 6/0 PDS. All the animals survived and grew normally. They were sacrificed 6-26 weeks postoperatively, when the mentioned variables were reestimated. No aortic narrowing was found and no suture material was detectable in the lumen. The subclavian flap had grown uniformly in length and width. Histologic examination showed evening of the inner surface by intimal proliferation and healing of the anastomoses. There was no sign of flap destruction and tissue reaction to PDS suture was minimal, indicating normal growth and viability in all parts of the flap. The suture material was absorbed 26 weeks postoperatively. Continuous suture with absorbable PDS seems to be a good alternative for repair of aortic coarctation in early infancy.\r"

This approach has been used to generate a library highly enriched in sequences closely linked to the cystic fibrosis marker met. One clone derived from the end of a Not I restriction fragment containing the met sequence was analyzed in detail and localized within a long range map to a position 300 kilobase pairs 5' of the metD sequence.\r"

  ".W": "The v-sis oncogene encodes a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-related product whose transforming activity is mediated by its functional interaction with the PDGF receptor. PDGF, as well as processed forms of the v-sis gene product, is a disulfide-linked dimer with eight conserved cysteine residues in the minimum region necessary for biologic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of the v-sis gene revealed that each conserved cysteine residue was required directly or indirectly for disulfide-linked dimer formation. However, substitution of serine for cysteine codons at any of four positions had no detrimental effect on transforming activity of the encoded v-sis protein. These results establish that interchain disulfide bonds are not essential in order for this protein to act as a functional ligand for the PDGF receptor. The remaining four substitutions of serine for cysteine each inactivated transforming function of the molecule. In each case this was associated with loss of a conformation shown to involve intramolecular disulfide bonds. These studies provide insight into the role of individual cysteine residues in determining the structure of the sis/PDGF molecule critical for biological activity.\r"

  ".W": "The slower and more economical contraction of smooth muscle as compared to that of skeletal muscle may relate to the arrangement of its contractile apparatus. Because the arrangement of the contractile apparatus determines the manner in which a single smooth muscle cell shortens, shortening of a contracting cell was examined by tracking of marker bead movements on the cell surface by means of digital video microscopy. Smooth muscle cells were observed to freely shorten in a unique corkscrew-like fashion with a pitch of 1.4 cell lengths (that is, the length change required for one complete rotation of cell) at a rate of 27 degrees per second. Corkscrew-like shortening was interpreted in terms of a structural model in which the contractile apparatus or cytoskeleton (or both) are helically oriented within the cell. Such an arrangement of these cytoarchitectural elements may help to explain in part the contractile capabilities of smooth muscle.\r"

The E motifs, which bind factors that are present in many if not all cells, mostly behave as transcriptional activating sites. The only known heavy chain enhancer site that binds a lymphocyte-specific factor, the \"octamer\" site, plays a critical role in transcription but only in a truncated form of the enhancer. In the full enhancer, no one site is crucial because of an apparent functional redundancy. The site in the kappa enhancer that binds a factor specific to mature B cells, kappa B, was crucial to the constitutive activity of the enhancer in B cells. This factor is also inducible in pre-B cells, and the site was necessary for inducibility of the kappa enhancer. Thus, the sites defined by protein binding are important for the functional activity of immunoglobulin enhancers, with the sites that bind proteins restricted in their cellular distribution playing the most important roles.\r"
