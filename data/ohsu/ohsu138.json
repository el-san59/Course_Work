  ".W": "This is a brief summary of the regulatory and other legal issues that may be raised by the provision of surgery outside of the hospital environment. Despite these potential problems, however, outpatient surgery embodies significant potential for hospitals, physicians, patients, and third-party payers. Outpatient surgical facilities embody the potential to achieve two of the government's primary goals: the provision of high-quality services and the reduction of health care costs. Third-party payers, similarly, are increasingly recognizing the benefits of outpatient surgery. Some are providing \"facility\" payments to cover the overhead costs of such facilities, or at least, providing an add-on to physicians' professional fees, for example, UCR (usual and customary rates) plus 20 per cent, if surgery is conducted in an office setting. Health maintenance organizations and other alternative delivery systems are actively seeking to enter into contracts with ambulatory surgical centers to provide outpatient surgical services to their enrollees because HMOs and other alternative delivery systems maximize profits by decreasing inpatient hospital utilization. In the years ahead, certificate of need and other regulatory barriers to the establishment of ambulatory surgical centers may fall as states increasingly begin to reassess the costs and benefits of certificate of need programs. In short, the trend toward outpatient surgical facilities and outpatient care generally is one that is here to stay.\r"

Patients were followed from forty-one to one hundred months after the second graft transplant. The sources for all grafts were either living related donors or cadavers. Graft nephrectomy was performed through the previous lower quadrant incision; the arterial and venous stumps of the primary grafts were used when possible. In all cases continuity of the urinary tract was reestablished with a Politano-Leadbetter ureteroneocystostomy. There appears to be no increased morbidity in any of these 6 cases, and the survival rate of the second graft is comparable to that of transplantation into the contralateral virginal fossa. Advantages of the simultaneous procedure are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Sterility in spinal-cord injured (SCI) men is believed to be caused by ejaculatory dysfunction, genital ductal blockage secondary to infection, and/or impaired spermatogenesis. Semen from SCI men demonstrates diminished numbers of motile, morphologically normal sperm. Testicular biopsies demonstrate impaired spermatogenesis. Leydig and Sertoli cells appear to be normal. Endocrine evaluations reveal normal testosterone levels with an adequate Leydig cell reserve. Luteinizing hormone (LD) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are normal or high with normal or exaggerated stimulation responses. Acute depressions in testosterone, FSH, and LH levels can be seen following SCI, most markedly in quadriplegics. A normal hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is implied by these findings, indicating a primary hypogonadism. Causes of impaired spermatogenesis may include local testicular temperature elevations, nondrainage of the reproductive tract, antisperm antibodies, and recurrent genitourinary infections. Treatment of infertility involves removal of these offending factors, and research is needed to correlate the impaired spermatogenesis with these factors.\r"

Technetium-99m-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) is injected intravenously and a posteriorly placed gamma scintillation camera used to image the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Furosemide is subsequently injected to stimulate a diuresis, and the washout pattern of isotope is monitored (time-activity histogram). Nonobstructive, obstructive, and poor renal function patterns were seen. Forty patients with varying degrees of hydroureteronephrosis were evaluated. Tracings were performed serially and compared with the clinical course in time, as well as with pressure flow studies and operative findings. All patients with a nonobstructed diuretic renogram did well, except for 1 boy in whom ureteropelvic obstruction developed later. Difficulty in evaluating the obstructive renogram pattern occurred only in some children with severe (grade V) hydronephrosis. Further standardization of the diuretic renogram with regard to time of diuretic injection, state of patient hydration, and regions of imaging may improve diagnostic accuracy.\r"

After a dose titration period starting with either verapamil 80 mg tid or 120 mg bid the patients kept their maintenance dose (240, 360 or 480 mg daily) for 4 weeks before crossing over to the other administration schedule. Repeated ambulatory blood pressure (BP) curves were recorded in 10 patients with a non-invasive portable device (Pressurometer III, Del Mar Avionics). The BP reductions (causal BP values) obtained by 2- and 3-dose regimens were of similar magnitude (from 170 +/- 19/105 +/- 8 on placebo to 140 +/- 17/87 +/- 7 and to 146 +/- 14/88 +/- 8 by 2-and 3-dose respectively). Analyses of BP curves revealed close similarity in profiles on the two dose regimens, although DBP was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower by 3-dose as compared to 2-dose regimen during the period 0.00-2.59 a.m. Long-term (circadian rhythm) and short-term variability did not differ between the regimens. Despite the slight difference in DBP curves after midnight, the overall impression is that verapamil given both twice and thrice daily provides adequate BP control throughout 24 hours.\r"

There was no significant differences in BP or metabolic variables between the two groups at entry. BP was reduced to the same degree by both treatments. Five men in the propranolol group and one man in the thiazide group developed clinically overt diabetes during follow-up. Fasting blood sugar increased slightly but significantly though equally in both groups. Oral glucose tolerance was initially impaired to the same degree in both groups but improved significantly during treatment with both drugs. Fasting insulin increased slightly but to the same degree. While serum potassium decreased significantly in the thiazide group, the total body potassium was unchanged in this group. In the propranolol group, serum potassium rose, while total body potassium decreased significantly. Serum urate increased in both groups, though slightly more during thiazide treatment. One case of gout was found in each group. There was no difference in serum lipids between the two groups. The finding in this long-term trial indicate that in middle-aged men with mild to moderate hypertension a low-dose thiazide diuretic like bendroflumethiazide is as effective and safe an antihypertensive agent as the beta-blocker propranolol is and that it does not induce diabetes. The total clinical picture favors the retention of thiazide diuretics as a first choice drug in hypertension.\r"

The incidence of DVT was 54% in the treatment group and 50% in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding number of DVTs needing treatment, number of positive scanning points or number of days for scan to become positive. Lethal pulmonary emboli occurred in one treated and in three control patients, respectively. Age and progress of neurologic symptoms predisposed for the development of DVT.

Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed before treatment started, and again after 3 and 12 months on CAPD. Before CAPD, the patients showed decreased glucose tolerance. However, neither fasting blood glucose and serum insulin and glucagon levels nor the insulin and glucagon levels during the tests were significantly different from results obtained in 13 healthy controls. During CAPD, the mean intraperitoneal supply of glucose from the dialysates varied between 121 and 245 g/day and did not change during the study period. Glucose tolerance and hormone responses to glucose did not change during the study period. No patient developed manifest diabetes mellitus. We conclude that glucose intolerance in uremia persists during CAPD, but despite the continuous peritoneal absorption of 100-200 g of glucose during CAPD, the treatment had no effect on glucose tolerance and insulin secretory response.\r"

The infection involved the renal poles only in 38 and the poles plus other renal cortical areas in eight. Four had abnormalities that spared the poles. Renal sonograms were abnormal in 32 of 50 children. Excretory urograms were abnormal in six of 23 children in whom they were obtained. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 34 of 40 children in whom voiding cystourethrography was performed. These data show the high sensitivity of renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-glucoheptonate in documenting upper urinary tract infection. The location of the abnormalities detected suggests that renal infections spread via an ascending mode and implies that intrarenal reflux is a major contributing factor.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports coronary and systemic hemodynamics, and metabolic responses to atrial pacing, prostacyclin (PGI2), and iloprost, its stable analogue, in 16 patients with severe coronary obstruction as well as predominant narrowing in the left anterior descending artery. PGI2 caused ischemia in six patients with low anginal threshold during pacing. In three of them ischemia was also precipitated by iloprost. Drugs were infused at therapeutic doses and were discontinued when pain occurred. Angina disappeared promptly (less than or equal to 3 minutes) and spontaneously after the infusion of PGI2, whereas after the analogue it was long lasting (greater than or equal to 5 minutes) and was relieved by 125 mg intravenous aminophylline, an antagonist of dipyridamole-induced coronary dilation. Ischemia was associated with a drug-induced decrease in arterial blood pressure and reflex tachycardia, and occurred despite increased great cardiac vein (GCV) blood flow and decreased resistance, which is consistent with either a failure of regional flow to increase proportionally to the metabolic demand or a subendocardial-subepicardial steal. However, the following findings favor the latter hypothesis: heart rate and rate-pressure product at the onset of pain were lower with drugs than with pacing, and GCV blood flow, measured at a comparable heart rate, was less with pacing than with drugs. In conclusion, PGI2 and analogues may induce ischemia in patients with advanced coronary artery disease. The mechanism appears to be related to a dipyridamole-like maldistribution of flow. Counteraction of ischemia can be achieved by aminophylline.\r"

Fifty-four out of 138 patients, with chest pain lasting less than 4 hours, with ST elevations diagnostic for acute myocardial infarction not responding to medical treatment, and without contraindication for thrombolytic therapy, had an occluded right coronary artery. In 26 of these 54 patients, the occlusion was located proximal to the first right ventricular branch. Fourteen of them were treated conventionally (group A) and 12 with intracoronary streptokinase (group B). In 28 patients, the occlusion was distal to the first right ventricular branch. Fifteen were treated conventionally (group C) and 13 with intracoronary streptokinase (group D). In all patients, coronary angiograms were made 2 to 3 weeks after acute myocardial infarction. A nuclear angiogram was made the second day after admission and 3 months later to determine right and left ventricular ejection fraction. Values of radionuclide left and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) between acute study (less than 48 hours after acute myocardial infarction [AMI]) and late study (3 months after AMI) showed no significant improvement in the four groups of patients studied. Group A patients (patients with total occlusion of the right coronary artery treated conventionally) had a significantly lower RVEF acutely and at late study as compared to the other three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Apo E allele frequencies vary significantly between different ethnic groups. The common apo E isoforms E2 (arg158----cys) and E4 (cys112----arg) differ functionally from the parent E3 isoform, explaining their effects on the normal variance of plasma lipoprotein concentrations and their association with hyperlipidemic conditions. In all studied populations the receptor-binding defective apo E2 (arg158----cys) is associated with low cholesterol and apo B in heterozygotes and results in primary dysbetalipoproteinemia or type III hyperlipoproteinemia in homozygotes. Conversely, the epsilon 4 allele is associated with high cholesterol in Finns and Germans but less or not significantly so in Japanese or Singapore populations. In addition to their effects on the normal variance of lipoprotein concentrations, the alleles epsilon 2 and epsilon 4 are associated with hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia, respectively. A working hypothesis explaining these observations is presented.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of alcohol intake on serum lipids and lipoproteins depend on the dose and mode of alcohol intake, individual susceptibility, genetic variables, and dietary factors. Therefore the changes of lipoprotein pattern are different among moderate and heavy drinkers. Moderate intake of alcohol increases the concentrations of apolipoproteins (apo) AI, apo AII, and high-density lipoprotein subfraction (HDL3) in plasma without any effects on other lipoproteins. If alcohol intake exceeds 60 to 80 gm per day, the synthesis of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles is stimulated. Even short-term use of alcohol stimulates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in adipose tissue, and consequently the concentration of VLDL in plasma stays normal or is even subnormal. If alcohol intake continues in excessive amounts, the increased transport rate of VLDL particles as a result of high LPL activity results in the up regulation of HDL2. This is clearly evident in chronic alcoholics. Low or subnormal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels are another characteristic of the lipoprotein pattern in chronic alcoholics. The increase of HDL (HDL2) and reduction of LDL levels could well explain the reduced risk of coronary heart disease in chronic alcoholics, whereas the causal factors remain open among moderate drinkers.\r"

  ".W": "The endogenous lipoprotein system (very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], intermediate-density lipoprotein [IDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cascade) holds the key to understanding the mechanisms by which hormones, diet, and drugs interact to regulate the plasma cholesterol level. Crucial components of this system are hepatic LDL receptors that mediate the uptake and degradation of plasma LDL. With experimental animals, it has been possible to demonstrate that hepatic LDL receptors are sensitive to hormonal, dietary, and pharmacologic manipulation. The decrease in number of hepatic LDL receptors in hypothyroidism or after cholesterol feeding leads to elevation of plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Conversely, the increase in number of hepatic LDL receptors results in lowering of plasma LDL cholesterol levels. This can be observed in hyperthyroidism, during administration of pharmacologic doses of 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol, or during treatment with cholesterol-lowering drugs such as the bile acid-binding resins and cholesterol-synthesis inhibitors. Since cholesterol excretion from the body occurs via the liver, the increased efficiency of disposal of plasma cholesterol by increasing hepatic LDL receptors will ultimately lead to depletion of excessive body cholesterol. Pharmacologic regulation of hepatic LDL receptors should be a valuable tool in the prevention and therapy of atherosclerosis.\r"

Only 2% of hypercholesterolemic patients have familial hypercholesterolemia. The causes of elevated cholesterol concentrations in the remaining patients have not been determined. Three major mechanisms may be responsible: overproduction of lipoproteins by the liver, reduced activity of receptors for low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and low affinity of circulating LDL for receptors. We have examined each of these mechanisms for primary hypercholesterolemia by isotope kinetic techniques. All three types have been identified, and the underlying causes of each are under investigation.\r"

  ".U": "87124377\r", 
  ".W": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism has been reviewed from information derived from turnover studies in humans. The two major HDL apoproteins AI and AII have different removal rates, reflecting the faster catabolism of HDL2 than of HDL3. This is caused by the continual cycle of formation of HDL2 from HDL3 and its reversion to HDL3, in response to the need to transport cholesterol and other lipids from extrahepatic cells and catabolized triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The conversion of HDL2 to HDL3 is mediated through a hepatic lipase. Because this lipase is inhibited by estrogen and stimulated by androgens, women have higher HDL2 levels than men. The synthesis of apoproteins AI and AII is also higher in women than in men. Nutrition also influences HDL turnover. Carbohydrates increase AI and HDL2 removal, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit synthesis. Vegetarians show high HDL removal rates. Thus low-fat, low-cholesterol diets generally lead to lower HDL levels. Disorders that alter HDL composition (such as alcoholic liver disease or Tangier disease) accelerate HDL removal. Other HDL proteins such as apoproteins C and E show faster turnover rates than AI and AII, since the former exchange with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and participate in their catabolism. Diminished exchange of apoprotein C from HDL to chylomicrons may be responsible for the diminished catabolism of these particles in type V hyperlipoproteinemia. The unusual turnover characteristics of HDL apoprotein AIV are reviewed, suggesting a dual role for this protein in both triglyceride and cholesterol transport. The striking relationship between very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and HDL metabolism is expressed in an inverse association between their respective removal rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To understand the relationship between very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride and VLDL apolipoprotein (apo) B, we studied their metabolisms simultaneously in 53 subjects with a range of obesity and glycemia. Obese subjects had increased production of both VLDL apo B and VLDL triglyceride and more VLDL of normal composition. Compared with nondiabetics, diabetic subjects had decreased clearance of both VLDL apo B and VLDL triglyceride, increased production of VLDL triglyceride but not of VLDL apo B, and more VLDL of abnormal composition. Production of both VLDL apo B and VLDL triglyceride were significantly correlated with plasma insulin concentrations, and rates of clearance of both were inversely correlated with plasma glucose. There was no direct correlation between total plasma free fatty acid concentration and production of either VLDL triglyceride or VLDL apo B, but VLDL triglyceride production was found to account for only a very small proportion of the nonoxidative component of free fatty acid turnover. We suggest that in obese subjects hyperinsulinemia induces overproduction of both VLDL apo B and VLDL triglyceride. In diabetes VLDL is increased in part because of decreased clearance; the altered composition is the result of the increase in VLDL-triglyceride production independent of apo B. The increase in VLDL triglyceride production may be mediated through plasma free fatty acids or glucose, although assessment of the relationship between these precursors and VLDL triglyceride is confounded by the fact that only a small portion of free fatty acids or glucose is converted to VLDL triglyceride.\r"

These two converting enzymes differ from each other in mechanism of action and specificity.

This is because of the compatible sex difference in plasma lipoprotein pattern and in coronary heart disease risk. Recent discoveries of the role of hepatic lipase in lipoprotein metabolism have elucidated mechanisms behind sex steroid-induced changes in lipoproteins. These steroids regulate the activity of hepatic lipase, an enzyme bound to the endothelial cells of liver sinusoids. Hepatic lipase has a central role in the removal of phospholipids and triglycerides from subfractions of high-density lipoprotein (HDL2) particles, but it may also function in the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich particles. Some older and more recent developments in this area will be reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that heterogeneity of human plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is, in part, the result of production of different LDL products from two subspecies of intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL). Cholesterol-enriched forms of both IDL species are found in plasma of patients with atherogenic dyslipidemias (familial hypercholesterolemia and type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia) and have physical properties similar to the major species in plasma of cholesterol-fed monkeys. Patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia have been shown to have increased plasma levels of IDL and of a smaller, denser LDL subclass (LDL-IIIA) that appears to be a metabolic product of the smaller IDL subspecies. Results from the NHLBI Type II Coronary Intervention study have supported a link between the small IDL-LDL pathway and coronary disease, in that 2-year changes in levels of these species were associated with disease progression. Furthermore, therapeutic reductions in IDL levels were correlated with increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Thus variation in IDL levels might influence coronary disease risk by both a direct effect and indirectly by affecting LDL particle number and possibly high-density lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

All patients had typical electrocardiographic changes diagnostic for an AMI and were admitted within 4 hours after the onset of chest pain; 245 patients were allocated to thrombolytic treatment and 243 to conventional treatment. Cumulative 72-hour release into plasma of myocardial alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) was used as a measure of infarct size. In general, the amount of infarct limitation due to thrombolytic therapy was proportional to the size of the area at risk. Patients with new Q waves, high QRS score and high ST-segment elevation or depression had the largest enzymatic infarct size in both treatment groups, irrespective of location of the AMI. Compared with conventionally treated patients, patients with anterior AMI treated with streptokinase had significant infarct size limitation (480 U/liter HBDH, 37%), and limitation was most prominent in those with Q waves (820 U/liter HBDH) or high ST elevation (750 U/liter HBDH). Infarct size limitation in inferior AMI was less impressive (330 U/liter HBDH, 33%) and patients with high ST-segment elevation (460 U/liter HBDH) or marked contralateral ST-segment depression (430 U/liter HBDH) had the most notable infarct limitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The cardiovascular effects of digoxin were monitored over 20 hours by indwelling pulmonary artery and radial artery lines and were compared with those of a control group of 10 patients who had normal postoperative LV function. Digoxin administration produced an increased cardiac index and mean arterial blood pressure within 2 hours. Within 4 hours after digoxin administration pulmonary artery wedge pressure in patients receiving digoxin was significantly lower than in control patients. At 16 hours there was a significant increase in both the LV stroke work and LV stroke work index in patients receiving digoxin vs control patients. Two patients receiving digoxin and 3 control patients had changes in cardiac rhythm during the study. Thus, digoxin can be safely administered to postoperative patients with LV dysfunction and is an acceptable inotropic agent.\r"

Combination therapy with diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide proved effective in a high percentage of mono-therapy nonresponders. The most common adverse reactions to diltiazem included headaches, dizziness and edema. The exact place of calcium entry blockers in therapy as initial or step-2 therapy with a diuretic in hypertension must be determined by additional long-term experience in large numbers of patients.\r"

The intracellular calcium receptor is calmodulin, which, through stimulation of myosin light chain kinase, can activate 2 different contractile states. The calcium is supplied from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the extracellular space; a minor component is supplied from the inner surface of the plasmalemma. The main intracellular messenger responsible for the transduction of receptor occupation and calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is IP3 and, to a lesser extent, calcium itself. The superficial location of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in vascular smooth muscle makes it the logical area for control of calcium entry due to calcium leak or through either or both types of calcium channel. The sarcoplasmic reticulum, therefore, acts as a \"superficial calcium buffer barrier\" and is probably the major system controlling free cytoplasmic calcium concentration in vascular smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The traditional concept of the renin-angiotensin system is a circulation-borne endocrine system whose components are secreted by different organs, i.e., renin from the kidney, angiotensinogen from the liver and angiotensin-converting enzyme from the lung. The product of the biochemical cascade, angiotensin II, acts on specific receptors on multiple target organs. Recent data, however, demonstrate that renin and angiotensin are synthesized locally in many tissues. The emerging concept--that angiotensin is produced locally at tissue sites by an endogenous renin-angiotensin system--has important implications to our understanding of cardiovascular homeostasis. This concept implies that local angiotensin concentrations may exceed those of plasma levels and may play an important role in the tonic control of vascular resistance, cardiac and adrenal functions as well as local intrarenal events. An important mechanism of action of converting enzyme inhibitors may be the blockade of tissue angiotensin generation. Hence, the tissue distribution and kinetics of converting enzyme inhibitors may be an important determinant of drug action. These findings have led us to speculate that aberrant tissue renin, angiotensinogen gene expression(s) or abnormalities in the regulation of the local renin-angiotensin system may result in such cardiovascular disorders as vasospasm, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

Although all of the calcium entry blockers effectively lower blood pressure, none adversely affects renal function: Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow are maintained. Diltiazem may increase glomerular filtration rate via attenuation of the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II or norepinephrine. Although all of the calcium entry blockers acutely increase salt and water excretion, most of the calcium entry blockers have no clinically sustained effect on salt and water excretion; serum electrolytes, urinary sodium and potassium excretion, body fluid composition and body weight are usually unchanged. Calcium entry blockers can be expected to assume a prominent role in the treatment of hypertension because of their ability to lower blood pressure while preserving renal perfusion and function.\r"

Atherogenic traits include the blood lipids, blood pressure and glucose tolerance. An increased low density lipoprotein cholesterol level is positively related, and an increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol level is inversely related, to cardiovascular disease incidence. Hypertension, whether systolic or diastolic, labile or fixed, casual or basal, at any age in either sex contributes greatly. The impact of diabetes is greater for women than men and varies depending on the level of the foregoing risk factors. An atherogenic lifestyle is typified by a diet excessive in calories, fat and salt, sedentary habits, unrestrained weight gain and smoking. Alcohol used in moderation may be beneficial. Oral contraceptives worsen atherogenic traits and, when used for long periods beyond age 35 and in conjunction with cigarettes, predispose to thromboembolism. Type A persons with an overdeveloped sense of time urgency, drive and competitiveness develop an excess of angina pectoris. Men married to more highly educated women are at increased risk as are men married to women in white collar jobs. Preclinical signs of compromised coronary circulation include silent myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy on the electrocardiogram, blocked intraventricular conduction and repolarization abnormalities. An electrocardiogram obtained during exercise may elicit still earlier evidence. Measures of innate susceptibility include a family history, history of premature cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and gout. Optimal prediction of risk requires a quantitative combination of risk factors in multiple logistic risk formulations to identify high risk persons with multiple marginal abnormalities.\r"

In patients with mild hypertension, the increase in blood pressure (BP) during dynamic exercise is similar to that seen in normal subjects, but in patients with severe hypertension it is steeper. During dynamic exercise total peripheral resistance is increased in all categories of hypertensive patients, including young subjects with apparently \"normal\" resistance at rest. The increase in stroke volume in transition from rest to exercise is subnormal, probably reflecting increased stiffness in the left ventricle. Static exercise causes dramatic increase in systolic as well as diastolic BP. Most antihypertensive agents control BP similarly during exercise and at rest. The hemodynamic mechanisms, however, differ greatly. The beta blockers induce a long-term reduction in cardiac output, muscle blood flow and, frequently, endurance capacity. In contrast, alpha-receptor blockers, calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors all reduce total peripheral resistance and do not decrease blood flow. Increase in endurance time has been reported with long-term calcium antagonist treatment. It would seem logical to select an antihypertensive drug that does not reduce exercise capacity when treating physically active patients with mild and moderate hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "87124477\r", 
  ".W": "The calcium antagonists provide a unique tool to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and prevent increases in coronary vasomotor tone. For patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina, diltiazem, nifedipine and verapamil are extremely effective in preventing episodes of coronary vasospasm and symptoms of ischemia. Unstable angina pectoris is a more complex pathophysiologic syndrome with episodes of ischemia due to increases in coronary vasomotor tone, intermittent platelet aggregation or alterations in the underlying atherosclerotic plaque. Each of the calcium antagonists is effective as monotherapy in decreasing the frequency of angina at rest. Nifedipine is the only calcium antagonist that has been studied in a combination regimen with beta blockers and nitrates for patients with unstable angina, and control of angina is better with the combination regimen than with either form of therapy alone. Although symptoms of myocardial ischemia in unstable angina are reduced by calcium antagonists, these agents do not seem to decrease the incidence of adverse outcomes. Antiplatelet therapy appears to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with unstable angina, suggesting that thrombus formation may play a central role in that disorder. Episodes of silent or asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, identified by ST-segment monitoring, occur in a variety of disorders of coronary disease. Among patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina and unstable angina, episodes of silent ischemia appear to be as frequent as episodes of angina and the calcium antagonists are effective in decreasing episodes of ischemia regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms. Persisting episodes of silent ischemia among patients with unstable angina despite maximal medical therapy identify patients at high risk for an early unfavorable outcome. Among patients with stable exertional angina, episodes of silent ischemia may be up to 5 times as frequent as episodes of angina, and may be due to increases in coronary vasomotor tone, transient platelet aggregation or increases in myocardial oxygen demand. Preliminary experience suggests that calcium antagonists and beta blockers are effective in decreasing episodes of silent ischemia in patients with stable exertional angina and that a combination regimen may be more effective than either form of therapy alone.\r"

  ".W": "Drugs of several chemical families have been identified as calcium antagonists. This article examines some pharmacologic properties of these drugs to clarify their terminology and their classification and to provide a rationale for their clinical use. Studies with nifedipine show quantitatively that the therapeutic effect in angina is related to the interaction of this drug with membrane calcium channels in human coronary arteries. This gives support to a classification based on studies at the molecular, tissue and organ levels. Among calcium antagonists, calcium entry blockers are defined as agents able to block calcium inward fluxes evoked by various stimuli. They may be subdivided in 2 groups. Group I is the group of selective calcium entry blockers. Group IA consists of those agents selective for slow calcium channels in myocardium (slow channel blockers); the leading agents are verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem. Group IB contains agents without action on slow calcium channels in myocardium but with selective action on arteries; the leading agents are cinnarizine and flunarizine. Group II is the group of nonselective calcium entry blockers. Group IIA contains agents acting at similar concentration on calcium and on fast sodium channels. Group IIB consists of agents interacting with calcium channels while having another primary site of action. Other agents modulate calcium movements by an action on sodium-calcium exchange and by an action within the cell. Their identification requires the use of cell biology. The actual clinical uses of these drugs are consistent with this pharmacologic classification.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium antagonists have emerged as a new class of antiarrhythmic agents for the control of certain supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Electrophysiologically, these agents are heterogeneous but their main action is mediated through a depressant effect on the slow calcium channel in cardiac muscle, most readily demonstrated in isolated tissue preparations. In vivo, their actions are modulated by their reflex actions and by their interaction with the autonomic nervous system due to the noncompetitive adrenergic-blocking actions that some of the compounds exhibit. The major agents exerting antiarrhythmic actions are verapamil, diltiazem, gallopamil, tiapamil and bepridil; the dihydropyridines are devoid of electrophysiologic actions in vivo. Calcium antagonists prolong intranodal conduction time, lengthen the effective and functional refractory periods in the atrioventricular node but exert little or no effect on atrial, ventricular, His-Purkinje or bypass tract conduction or refractoriness (except in the case of bepridil, which has additional electrophysiologic properties). These effects form the basis of the clinical antiarrhythmic effects of this class of agents. The most striking action is the predictable and prompt termination of the reentrant supraventricular tachycardia by intravenous verapamil and diltiazem and the slowing of the ventricular response in atrial flutter and fibrillation. These agents may also be of value in the long-term control of ventricular response in atrial flutter and fibrillation; their role in multifocal atrial tachycardia and other ectopic tachycardias is less well defined. Calcium antagonists reverse ischemic ventricular arrhythmias caused by coronary artery spasm but exert little or no action in the usual forms of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias associated with severe structural heart disease. They are poor suppressants of ventricular premature complexes. Recent data have established their role in exercise-induced tachycardia occurring in the context of ischemic heart disease; they are also of value in ventricular tachycardia occurring in young patients who develop tachycardia with a right bundle branch block and left axis deviation morphology, an arrhythmia thought to be due to triggered automaticity.\r"

A massive influx of calcium into the neuron constitutes the \"final common pathway,\" resulting in catabolism and cell necrosis due to calcium overload. Treatment with calcium antagonists may offer a means of arresting and possibly preventing the destruction of cerebral tissue in patients with stroke. One such drug, nimodipine, selectively inhibits spasm of isolated cerebral arteries induced by either depolarization or receptor stimulation. In vivo experiments have shown that nimodipine prevents the postischemic impairment of cerebral blood flow that may be a major contributor to neuronal damage. After encouraging although not conclusive results of a single-blind pilot study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical investigation of nimodipine was undertaken. Some benefit was strongly suggested in patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with 120 mg of nimodipine, begun within 24 hours after the onset of the event, combined with \"standard\" treatment (i.e., hemodilution using low molecular dextran). Calcium antagonists such as nimodipine may be useful in the treatment of stroke due to acute cerebral ischemia.\r"

Although their main pharmacodynamic actions are vasodilatation and myocardial depression, they are not uniform in producing these effects. Based on comparison of the potencies in producing negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects to the coronary vasodilator potency of individual calcium antagonists determined by use of isolated, blood-perfused papillary muscle, sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node preparations of dogs, calcium antagonists are classified into 2 major groups. The dihydropyridines, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, nitrendipine, PN 200-110 (isradipine) and PY 108-068, are generally far more potent in producing coronary vasodilatation than in producing negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic (first-degree atrioventricular block) effects, although there are minor differences among them. The non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, verapamil, diltiazem, KB-944, bepridil and MCI-176, are nearly equipotent in producing coronary vasodilatation and a negative dromotropic effect, although all of them are less potent in producing negative inotropy. The non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists can be further divided into 2 subgroups. Verapamil, diltiazem and KB-944 are nearly equipotent in producing negative dromotropic and chronotropic effects. Bepridil and MCI-176 are less potent in producing negative chronotropy than in producing negative dromotropy.\r"

The activated form of myosin light chain kinase phosphorylates myosin on the 20,000-dalton light chain and contractile activity ensues. Calcium may also enhance smooth muscle contractile activity by binding directly to myosin, the main component of the thick filament. Recent studies raise the possibility that the calcium-calmodulin complex may also modulate smooth muscle contractile activity by removing the inhibition imposed by caldesmon, a protein that is bound to the thin (i.e., actin-containing) filaments of smooth muscle. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent kinase, protein kinase C, can phosphorylate smooth muscle myosin at a different site than does myosin light chain kinase and down-regulate its actin-activated magnesium adenosine triphosphatase activity. This raises the possibility that protein kinase C phosphorylation of myosin may play a role in modulating vascular contractile activity in vivo.\r"

Because of its relatively more pronounced negative inotropic and chronotropic actions, verapamil is generally not tolerated by patients with left ventricular failure. In addition, even relatively vascular-selective agents such as nifedipine can occasionally cause significant left ventricular depression, particularly if combined with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Comparative studies using nitroprusside to cause an equivalent decrease in arterial pressure indicate that nifedipine acts predominantly on the arterial vasculature, and that a small but significant decrease in contractility occurs, apparently due to a direct myocardial action. Although diltiazem causes a depression in myocardial contractility in dogs with volume overload heart failure, limited data show no significant negative inotropic action in patients with heart failure. The negative inotropic effects, if any, of newer and possibly more vascular-selective agents are not yet known. Calcium antagonists appear to act predominantly on the limb and coronary vasculature, with relatively less effect on renal and hepatic vessels. In patients with CHF, nifedipine causes an increase in coronary blood flow and a decrease in the aorto-coronary sinus oxygen difference indicating an improvement in myocardial energetics. Although nifedipine causes an increase in cardiac index and decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise, the limited data available fail to show a short- or long-term increase in exercise capacity. Nifedipine causes an increase in plasma renin activity, possibly due to a direct action on the kidney.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After relatively short periods of ischemia the damage is reversible, but with longer periods of ischemia the number of cells that are lethally injured increases. When coronary flow is restored the lethally injured cells become overloaded with Ca++ and fail to regenerate adenosine triphosphate. The calcium antagonists provide protection under these circumstances, but only if used prophylactically. When added only upon reperfusion the calcium antagonists slow, but do not inhibit, the excessive gain in Ca++ that occurs during postischemic reperfusion. Nicotine, in a concentration equivalent to that found in the plasma of smokers (0.15 microgram/ml), exacerbates the reperfusion-induced Ca++ gain. Treatment with the long-acting calcium antagonist, anipamil, on a once-daily basis attenuates the reperfusion-induced Ca++ gain in spontaneously hypertensive rats and its exacerbation by nicotine in Sprague Dawley rats. The prolonged oral administration of at least 1 calcium antagonist, verapamil (50 mg/kg body weight/day), causes a significant (p less than 0.001) depletion of left ventricular norepinephrine.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous studies have been conducted over the past 10 years on the effects of calcium antagonists on regional myocardial ischemia and infarct size. Verapamil, for example, reduced the degree of adenosine triphosphate degradation during 15 minutes of coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion in an anesthetized canine preparation. It also preserved the ultrastructural appearance of mitochondria in myocardium subjected to 1 hour of ischemia. Using an 8-hour permanent coronary artery occlusion model in which risk zone was assessed with radioactive microspheres and infarct size determined by tetrazolium staining, verapamil, administered 1 hour after occlusion, resulted in a modest decrease in infarct size. In a reperfusion model in which anesthetized dogs were subjected to 3 hours of coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 hours of reperfusion, verapamil decreased infarct size when it was administered during the period of ischemia, but failed to decrease infarct size when administered only during the reperfusion phase, i.e., after 3 hours of ischemia. Although verapamil is known to have negative inotropic effects, the newer calcium antagonist agent nisoldipine is less negatively inotropic, and might therefore be preferable in the situation of compromised hemodynamics. In a 6-hour permanent coronary artery occlusion model, nisoldipine decreased infarct size without decreasing left ventricular contractility. Most published reports support the concept that calcium antagonists decrease infarct size in models of experimental infarction. Of 4 major clinical studies, only 1 has shown that calcium antagonists are capable of reducing infarct size in man. However, in most of these studies, drug therapy commenced relatively late--4 or more hours after symptoms. In order for these drugs to demonstrate beneficial effects, the risk zone may have to be small and the degree of collateral flow adequate, the drug may have to be given very early or even before coronary occlusion (in a prophylactic fashion) and administration of the drug may have to be coupled to early coronary reperfusion.\r"

Numerous reports suggest that response to calcium antagonists is similar to that with beta-adrenergic blockers, although the latter tend to show somewhat greater efficacy. Advantages in favor of calcium antagonists include the relative freedom from side effects that may occur with beta-adrenergic antagonists; the 2 types of substances can be combined usefully and given to the vast majority of patients requiring medication for angina. Left ventricular failure is a relative contraindication to both calcium antagonists and beta-adrenergic blockers, and thus to the combination. With calcium antagonists, however, the negative inotropic effects are often balanced by the associated peripheral vasodilatation. Where medical management of chronic stable angina is considered, calcium antagonists offer a reasonable alternative to beta blockers, and the use of the combination is highly effective, more so than either substance alone.\r"

The frequency of weekly anginal episodes was reduced from 7.6 +/- 10.0 with placebo to 3.1 +/- 4.2 after the regular formulation of verapamil (p = 0.09) and from 6.4 +/- 7.6 with placebo to 2.8 +/- 4.8 after verapamil-SR (p = 0.06).

Time to the onset of angina was similarly prolonged by formulations of verapamil. There were no significant adverse effects after 1 year in any patient taking verapamil-SR, 240 mg twice daily. Thus, a twice-a-day verapamil-SR dose regimen is safe and is as effective for treatment of angina of effort as the regular formulation given 4 times a day.\r"

The present investigation selected patients after acute myocardial infarction who had ambulatory electrocardiographic qualifying arrhythmia for CAPS. An additional baseline electrocardiogram was recorded before enrollment in the study to assess baseline spontaneous variability of VPCs. A total of 88 patients (15 women, 73 men, aged 57 +/- 10 years) were studied. The 43 patients (49%) receiving beta-blocking drugs were included because the dose was not altered between the 2 consecutive electrocardiographic recordings. This investigation shows that a 95% reduction in VPCs is required to document a significant drug effect rather than variability alone if 1 day of control and 1 day of treatment electrocardiographic recording are compared. Similarly, based on 1 day of electrocardiographic recording before and after antiarrhythmic therapy, 1,780% increase in VPC frequency is required to establish \"arrhythmia aggravation\" from an antiarrhythmic drug rather than from variability alone based on a 95% confidence interval. Variability of ventricular arrhythmias is independent of left ventricular function, whereas patients taking beta-blocking therapy tend to have greater VPC variability (p = 0.052), even though VPC frequencies were lower (59 +/- 19 vs 138 +/- 31 VPCs/hour, p less than 0.006) than those not taking beta-blocking drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to quantitate abundance of 2H in body water of human infants. This method provides precise measurement of total-body water without the extensive sample preparation requirements of previously described methods for determination of 2H content in body fluids. 2H2O (1 g/kg body weight) was administered to infants and saliva and urine were collected for up to 5 h. An internal standard was added directly to the fluid specimen and 2H enrichment in water was measured by NMR spectroscopy. Working range of deuterium abundance was 0.04-0.32 atom %. Coefficients of variation for saliva samples at 0.20 atom % 2H was 1.97%. 2H content in urine and saliva water reached a plateau by 4 h after administration, and amounts in the two fluids were virtually identical. Mean total-body water determination for six infants was 58.3 +/- 5.8% of body weight (range 53-66%).\r"

Results were compared with dextran-coated charcoal cytosolic assay (DCC) and with conventional immunohistochemistry on frozen sections. Sensitivity and specificity for determinations on paraffin sections were 88% and 86%, respectively, and statistical analysis showed very good agreement between DCC and paraffin sections (kappa = 0.805). The DNase technic on paraffin sections allows excellent correlation between histologic characteristics and ER status and reduces DCC sampling error resulting from stromal dilution and tumor variability. This method offers a reliable and reproducible alternative when tissue is not suitable or unavailable for DCC or frozen tissue analysis and can be used for retrospective studies on stored tissue blocks.\r"

All of the tumors presumably derived from the epithelial lining of the bile duct, including cholangiocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinomatous portion of the mixed hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma, and biliary cystadenocarcinoma showed strong positive reaction.

The antigens were detected with an indirect immunoperoxidase technic on paraffin sections after pretreatment with pronase for M1 antigens and without pretreatment for CEA. The staining pattern revealed different correlations with the various parameters, i.e., size, histologic type, atypia, and ploidy of the adenomas. Especially the cytoplasmic staining of anti-M1, Mab (1-13 M1) correlated well with aneuploidy (R = 0.43; P less than or equal to 0.001) and with the DNA index (R = 0.34; P less than or equal to 0.01). Staining of the anti-CEA Mab only correlated with the size of the adenomas (R = 0.29; P less than or equal to 0.03). It is concluded that the immunoreactivity of Mab (1-13 M1), which significantly correlated with aneuploidy, may be associated with malignant transformation in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-five patients with dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, 12 with (9 patients and 3 follow-up) and 23 without associated mycosis fungoides, and 7 controls with 26 lymph nodes were studied by light microscopic examination and immunostaining for S-100 protein. Fourteen of these cases were examined ultrastructurally. The group of cases studied included lymph nodes obtained at postmortem examination from three patients with mycosis fungoides and evidence of nodal involvement by light microscopic examination. Lymph nodes from patients with dermatopathic lymphadenopathy and paracortical hyperplasia (but no effacement of architecture by recognizable mycosis fungoides cells by light microscopic examination) associated with biopsy-proven mycosis fungoides showed well-defined, diffusely distributed sheets of S-100-positive cells. Cases of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy unassociated with a skin lymphoma (23 cases), with the exception of 3 cases (12.5%), only showed scattered S-100-positive cells, a similar pattern to that noted in normal or reactive lymph nodes from the control cases and reported literature. In the three cases with diffuse sheets without associated mycosis fungoides, the intensity of S-100 staining was the same in germinal centers as in parafollicular areas, while in cases associated with mycosis fungoides, the staining was predominantly in parafollicular zones. Ultrastructural immunolabeling for S-100 protein also revealed different patterns in both subsets of patients. Interestingly, in cases in which the lymph nodes were identified by light microscopic examination to be replaced by mycosis fungoides, the sheets of S-100-positive cells disappeared. The corresponding ultrastructural evaluation showed cellular aggregates with features of T-cells. A combination of S-100 immunocytochemistry and morphologic ultrastructural assessment can be of help in evaluation of lymphadenopathy in patients with mycosis fungoides. Although this study indicates that the finding of sheets of S-100-positive cells in patients with dermatopathic lymphadenopathy is not always associated with mycosis fungoides, the identification of diffuse sheets of S-100-positive cells, especially with parafollicular distribution, in a patient without known T-cell lymphoma should probably be considered an indication to suggest a complete clinical evaluation to rule out the possibility of an undiagnosed mycosis fungoides. The finding of sheets of S-100-positive cells in patients with proven mycosis fungoides may be a morphologic indicator of impending extracutaneous dissemination.\r"

Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) was evaluated as an alternative to indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) testing of QAE-Sephadex A50-treated sera for detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific IgM. The Cytomegelisa assay was consistently more sensitive than IFA testing for detection of CMV-specific IgM. Of 101 rheumatoid factor-negative sera that were IFA positive before column separation, only 47 (46%) remained positive after column separation, while 72 (71%) were positive using Cytomegelisa. Nine transplant patients who had primary CMV infection develop were also evaluated. Two of the nine did not form sufficient IgM to remain IFA positive after column separation, however, all had IgM detected by Cytomegelisa. In all cases, Cytomegelisa provided laboratory evidence of CMV infection earlier or at the same time as IgG seroconversion or IgM testing by column/IFA. Comparison of both methods with 100 consecutive sera received for CMV testing yielded five sera positive for CMV-IgM with the column/IFA method and 20 using Cytomegelisa. The specificity of Cytomegelisa was evaluated with 56 RF-positive/CMV IgG-positive sera. Four of 56 (7%) appeared positive after column separation; however, of concern, 22 of 56 (39%) remained positive in the Cytomegelisa.\r"

Cell suspension studies also were not diagnostic because a monoclonal B-cell population could not be defined. Alternatively, when we focused on the subendothelial infiltrate in the frozen sections prepared for immunohistochemical studies, the findings indicated that the subendothelial cells were monoclonal B-cells (IgG, kappa). Staining with monoclonal antibodies disclosed the phenotype Tac+, Leu-14+, Leu-M5+, B2-, BA-1-, and BA-2-, a phenotype characteristic of HCL. In this case, an unusual but nondiagnostic morphologic finding provided guidance for the correlative immunophenotypic analysis of the same site in frozen sections and thereby allowed a definitive diagnosis.\r"

Thirty-six children had a previous history of febrile convulsions, and 31 children had a family history of convulsive disorder. Most of the children were 0.5 to 3 years of age, although 49 (32%) were older than 3 years of age and 20 (13.1%) were older than 5 years of age. All children were febrile; in 75% of the children, the temperature was over 39 degrees C. The majority of the children had generalized, self-limited convulsions, which lasted less than ten minutes. In 30 children the seizures were categorized as complex; ten of them had recurrent episodes, although none had any residual neurologic deficit. The total leukocyte count was usually within normal limits, but the differential count characteristically showed a marked increase in the number of band forms. Hypocalcemia (blood calcium level, less than 9.01 mg/dL [less than 2.25 mmol/L]) was observed in four patients; hyponatremia (blood sodium level, 130 mEq/L [130 mmol/L]), in 11 patients; and hypernatremia (blood sodium level, 157 mEq/L [157 mmol/L]), in one patient. Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies were performed in ten children, and lumbar punctures were performed in 34 children; both procedures usually yielded normal results. Shigella sonnei was isolated from 69% of the children; Shigella flexneri from 25%; Shigella boydii from 5%; and Shigella dysenteriae from 1%. Due to the benign and self-limited nature of most of the convulsions, neither diagnostic procedures, nor drug therapy, are usually necessary. These measures should, however, be considered in complicated cases characterized by focal or prolonged seizures.\r"

Total correction of previously inoperable congenital cardiac defects is being performed with increasing frequency and in children at progressively younger ages. While the majority of children undergoing cardiac surgery survive without incident, increasing concern is being raised about neurologic sequelae seen in some survivors. Complications such as embolization, hypoxia, inadequate cerebral perfusion, and biochemical disturbances may all lead to brain damage following cardiac surgery. Acute postoperative neurologic problems include seizures, impaired levels of consciousness, focal motor deficits, and movement disorders. Long-term sequelae include language and learning disorders, mental retardation, seizures, and cerebral palsy. Intraoperative cerebral monitoring techniques are as yet imperfect, but their use in combination with meticulous intraoperative and postoperative care currently provides the best means of reducing neurologic morbidity. Future studies should explore other methods of preserving neurologic integrity in children undergoing open heart surgery.\r"

The six male and two female patients ranged in age from 7 to 19 years. Six of eight patients had delayed bone ages and height greater than 2.5 SDs below the mean. Of the six patients more than 13 years of age, two had clinical evidence of isolated adrenarche and only one had evidence of true puberty. Cortisol levels were similar in patients and controls at zero time (10.6 +/- 1.8 micrograms/dL [292 +/- 50 nmol/L] vs 10.8 +/- 1.4 micrograms/dL [298 +/- 39 nmol/L]) and at 60 minutes (26.6 +/- 2.5 micrograms/dL [734 +/- 69 nmol/L] vs 24.9 +/- 1.9 micrograms/dL [687 +/- 52 nmol/L]) after insulin hypoglycemia (all values are the mean +/- SE). During an eight-hour infusion of ACTH, cortisol responses in the patients with thalassemia were not significantly different from those of controls. Baseline levels of the adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) were significantly lower in the subjects with thalassemia compared with controls of similar bone age and pubertal status. The prolonged ACTH infusion caused a significant increase in the DHEA level (79.2 +/- 14.7 ng/dL [2.74 +/- 0.51 nmol/L] vs 538.6 +/- 38.1 ng/dL [18.67 +/- 4.79 nmol/L]) and the DHEA-S level (37.5 +/- 10.8 micrograms/dL [1.02 +/- 0.29 mumol/L] vs 70.5 +/- 18.3 micrograms/dL [1.19 +/- 0.50 mumol/L]) in the patients. The patients' peak stimulated levels of DHEA-S were significantly lower than those of the controls, whereas peak levels of DHEA were similar in the patients and the controls. These results indicate that combined multiple transfusions and chelation therapy preserve the integrity of the ACTH-cortisol axis in patients with thalassemia. The reduced levels of adrenal androgens, short stature, and delayed puberty noted in our patients suggest, however, that alternative approaches to the therapy of thalassemia are needed.\r"

Patients ranged in age from 5 months to 11.3 years. Needle aspiration of infected sites was performed in all patients, and 11 (44%) required further surgical drainage. Imipenem and cilastatin sodium in a dosage of 100 mg/kg/d was used for children 3 years of age or younger, while older ones received 60 mg/kg/d intravenously, divided in four equal doses. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 15 patients (60%): Staphylococcus aureus in five, Haemophilus influenzae b in four, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two, Streptococcus pneumoniae in one, group A Streptococcus in one, Kingella kingae in one, and Citrobacter amalonaticus in one. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem in vitro. Imipenem and cilastatin therapy was continued for a median of six days followed by treatment with appropriate orally administered antibiotics. Median peak serum bactericidal titers after imipenem and cilastatin infusions were 1:512 for S aureus, 1:32 for H influenzae b, 1:512 for streptococci, and 1:16 for gram-negative rods. All but one patient with P aeruginosa osteomyelitis responded favorably to imipenem and cilastatin. The median duration until resolution of symptoms was six days. Imipenem and cilastatin infusions were well tolerated, and side effects included maculopapular rash in one patient, watery diarrhea in one, and mild transient elevation of alanine aminotransferase levels in three. Because of imipenem and cilastatin's unusually broad spectrum of activity and its relative safety, this drug combination can be used for the initial, empiric therapy of acute bone and joint infections in pediatric patients.\r"

Infusion of vasopressin (0.3 U/min) significantly decreased portal venous pressure (-36%), the gradient between portal venous pressure and free hepatic venous pressure (-50.6%), and portal venous flow (-54.3%) but did not reduce mean arterial pressure and pulse rate.

However, the expense, morbidity, and inconvenience of this therapy have created interest in surgical alternatives for the treatment of the short bowel syndrome. The goals of surgical therapy in the short bowel syndrome are to slow intestinal transit, increase the area of absorption, and reduce gastric hyperacidity. Antiperistaltic segments or colon interposition benefit patients with sufficient absorptive area, but rapid intestinal transit. Intestinal valves yield inconsistent results. Recirculating loops are associated with prohibitive morbidity and mortality. Experience with intestinal pacing is limited. Patients with dilated bowel segments may benefit from intestinal tapering or lengthening. Growing neomucosa holds promise but has not been evaluated clinically. Despite recent advances in immunosuppression the results of transplantation remain unsatisfactory. Gastric hyperacidity can be effectively controlled by H2 receptor antagonists. None of the operations for treatment of the short bowel syndrome is sufficiently safe and effective to recommend their routine use. Operations should be performed only on selected patients to achieve specific goals. Although investigation continues, our emphasis should continue to be prevention of intestinal resection and conservation of as much of the intestine as possible when massive resection is necessary.\r"

This pattern of hyperlipidemia has been associated with an increased risk of accelerated atherosclerosis in other populations. Despite extensive studies of diet and drug therapy in other populations, few such therapeutic studies exist in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. To investigate the effect of diet and lipid-lowering drugs on the lipoprotein-lipid profile of patients with unremitting nephrotic syndrome and marked hyperlipidemia, we conducted a controlled trial using two such drugs: colestipol and probucol. Colestipol lowered the mean total fasting plasma cholesterol of seven patients from 397 +/- 27 to 317 +/- 37 mg/dL, a 20.2% decrease, and lowered the LDL cholesterol from 398 +/- 28 to 203 +/- 18 mg/dL, a 31.9% decrease. It did not affect the HDL cholesterol level, and thus lowered the LDL-to-HDL cholesterol ratio. Probucol lowered the mean total cholesterol from 439 +/- 72 to 339 +/- 60 mg/dL, a 22.6% decrease, and the LDL cholesterol from 282 +/- 43 to 215 +/- 26 mg/dL, a 23.8% decrease. Although the HDL cholesterol was lowered from 49 +/- 9 to 43 +/- 7 mg/dL by probucol, a 12.2% decrease, the LDL-to-HDL cholesterol ratio still declined. Both drugs were well tolerated and proved safe in this short-term trial. Antihyperlipidemic therapy may well be indicated in certain patients with unremitting nephrotic syndrome.\r"

Moderate azotemia occurred during the first postoperative week in 58% of 43 cyclosporine-treated recipients, but in only 34% of 41 azathioprine-treated recipients, and 4% of 25 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for nontransplant surgery (both P less than .01 v cyclosporine). Acute renal failure developed in an additional 12% of the cyclosporine-treated group. Late postoperative renal dysfunction also occurred with a high prevalence. Life-table analysis indicated that at 6 months 55%, at 12 months 17%, at 24 months 4%, and at 36 months no cyclosporine-treated recipients retained normal renal function. Three renal biopsies performed in subjects with late nephrotoxicity demonstrated prominent interstitial fibrosis. Although one patient subsequently required chronic dialysis, reduction of cyclosporine dosage from a mean of 5.3 +/- 0.7 mg/kg/d to a mean of 2.3 +/- 0.3 mg/kg/d 9 to 21 months after transplantation with concurrent initiation of azathioprine therapy to prevent rejection led to an improvement of renal function in the five patients so treated. These data indicate that there are two distinct forms of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Although both occur with high prevalence, the early form does not appear to be a specific risk factor for the late form.\r"

Using fluorescein-conjugated antibody to human Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), it was demonstrated that some free cells in urine are coated with THP. To evaluate the usefulness of this observation in the differentiation of upper from lower urinary tract disease, the presence of THP coating of cells was correlated with the clinical diagnosis in 141 subjects. The percentage of THP-coated cells for each group (mean +/- SD) was Healthy volunteers (n = 10), 4% +/- 2%; hospitalized controls (n = 20), 3% +/- 3%; glomerulonephritis (n = 21), 61% +/- 6%; chronic interstitial nephritis (n = 26), 56% +/- 5%; other renal parenchymal diseases (n = 14), 50% +/- 8%; bladder disease (n = 14), 8% +/- 2%; and hypertension (n = 36), 24% +/- 33%. Based on the results from the bladder disease group, 12% coating was set as the 95% confidence limit for lower urinary tract disease. The results in this group were not different from control subjects. By analysis of variance and chi 2 analysis, subjects with renal parenchymal disease could be distinguished from those with hypertension and bladder disease (P less than .001 and P less than .0001, respectively). The presence of cellular coating by THP in renal parenchymal disease and its absence in bladder disease suggests that this simple test may be of use in determining the origin of free cells observed in the routine microscopic urinalysis.\r"

Results have been compared with healthy control subjects, patients receiving hemodialysis, and renal graft recipients. Significant low levels of total HDL and HDL2 cholesterol are observed in men with CRF. The more severe the CRF, the more likely that total HDL and HDL2 cholesterol will be low. Moreover, a significant inverse correlation is found between HDL2 cholesterol and serum creatinine levels. In women, although a decrease in total and HDL2 subfraction is observed, no significant differences are found across the severity of CRF. Serum HDL2 cholesterol levels are decreased in men and women receiving hemodialysis, while raised total HDL and HDL2 cholesterol levels are observed in normally functioning renal grafts. These results indicate that according to the \"HDL hypothesis,\" despite other associated risk factors, the high cardiovascular mortality rates noted mainly in men with CRF under conservative treatment and in patients receiving hemodialysis could be explained, at least in part, by the sustained and progressive decrease in total HDL and HDL2 values. From this point of view, our study suggests the need to promote early kidney transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of hypertension in the geriatric population is very high and is a significant determinant of cardiovascular risk in this group. The tendency for blood pressure to increase with age in westernized societies such as the United States may depend on environmental factors such as diet, stress, and inactivity. Our population tends to become more obese; to consume relatively greater amounts of sodium and lesser amounts of potassium, calcium, and magnesium; and to decrease exercising with increasing age. Senescent changes in the cardiovascular system leading to decreased vascular compliance and decreased baroreceptor sensitivity contribute not only to rising blood pressure but also to an impairment of postural reflexes and orthostatic hypotension. The hallmark of hypertension in the elderly is increased vascular resistance. Greater vascular reactivity in the elderly hypertensive patients may reflect decreased membrane sodium pump activity and decreased beta-adrenergic receptor activity as well as age-related structural changes. Treatment of diastolic hypertension in the elderly is associated with decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although treatment of systolic hypertension may not decrease immediate cardiovascular mortality, it appears to decrease the incidence of stroke. The initial therapeutic approach to the elderly hypertensive patient should generally consist of a reduction in salt and caloric intake and an increase in aerobic exercise, i.e., walking. Drug therapy should be initiated with lower doses of medication with a special concern about orthostatic hypotension.\r"

To resolve this confusion, hypertensive subgroups were first defined by plasma renin activity, dietary salt sensitivity, sensitivity to calcium channel blockade, and calcium metabolic indices. Using these classification schemes, different patterns of calcium metabolism emerged, each predictive of divergent clinical responses. Patients with low plasma renin activity, low serum ionized calcium levels, and dietary salt sensitivity, such as black and elderly hypertensive patients, may preferentially benefit from calcium supplementation. It is postulated that calcium-regulating hormones and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system coordinately monitor dietary mineral intake, and transduce these environmental signals at the cellular level by altering cellular calcium uptake and disposition. Analysis of these hormonal systems is useful diagnostically in defining those patients who would most benefit from non-pharmacologic dietary forms of treatment.\r"

After age 20, the plasma total cholesterol concentration increases progressively, and in men reaches a plateau between the ages of 50 and 60 years, whereas in women, it reaches a peak between 60 and 70 years of age. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration increases progressively in men and women after age 20, but more rapidly in men, accounting for most of the overall gender difference in total cholesterol. The rate at which the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration increases in women begins to accelerate between 40 and 50 years of age, and the concentration exceeds that in men by 55 to 60 years. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decrease in males during puberty and early adulthood, and thereafter remain lower than those in women at all comparable ages. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations remain constant in women throughout their lifetime. Beyond 30 years of age, women taking estrogen preparations have higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations than women who are not taking estrogens. The triglyceride concentration increases progressively in men, reaching peak values between 40 and 50 years of age, and then declining slightly thereafter. In women, the triglyceride concentration increases throughout their lifetime, but is always higher in those using estrogens. Whether these changes in lipoprotein concentrations merely accompany the increasing prevalence of atherosclerotic vascular disease that occurs with age, or contribute to it, is unknown at this time.\r"

It is estimated that there are more than one million osteoporosis-related fractures yearly in the United States, which are responsible for between three and four billion dollars in health care expenditures. A discussion of osteoporosis requires consideration of both the physiology and pathophysiology of bone tissue. In a structural sense, bone exists in two forms, the outer compact cortex accounting for 80 percent of total bone volume, and the more porous inner trabecular bone. Bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts are responsible for the ongoing, life-long process of formation and resorption of bone. Sex hormone deficiency, as well as chronic illness, malnutrition, and childhood immobilization, has deleterious effects on growth and modeling, ultimately reducing peak bone mass and setting the stage for osteoporosis in later life. Estrogen is known to have a protective effect on the female skeleton. The mechanisms of this effect are unknown, although estrogen may protect against parathyroid hormone-mediated bone loss. There may be a particular subset of postmenopausal women who are particularly susceptible to estrogen deficiency. Calcitonin levels, which decrease postmenopausally, return to normal with estrogen; other hormones may also play important roles. Osteoporosis is not the result of a single hormonal deficiency or excess; it must be considered in relation to other pathogenetic and risk factors.\r"

The most likely cellular mechanism is an increase in the number of resorption cavities deep enough to lead to focal perforation of trabecular plates, either as a non-specific consequence of increased remodeling activation, or as a specific consequence (direct or indirect) of estrogen deficiency. Disruption of the connections between structural elements produces a disproportionate loss of strength, for which the increased thickness of the remaining trabeculae can only partly compensate. Consequently, the most biomechanically significant component of trabecular bone loss occurs rapidly and irreversibly. This emphasizes the importance of prevention, but no treatment except estrogen replacement is of proven efficacy in preventing estrogen-dependent bone loss. For adequate repair of structural damage after it has been allowed to occur, adding bone to existing surfaces may be insufficient, and it may be necessary to devise some means of forming new bone directly in the bone marrow cavity in order to re-establish normal connectivity.\r"

  ".W": "Both adequate nutrition and exercise are essential for development of peak adult bone mass and maintenance of bone during aging. The optimal dietary level of a nutrient may vary from individual to individual and may change with age, intake of other nutrients, disease, drug therapy, or sex hormone status. Effects on spinal trabecular bone may not parallel effects on axial cortical bone. Calcium nutrition is important in the prevention of osteoporosis, as calcium is a major constituent of bone. The intake of calcium among most American adults is below the levels recommended by public health agencies. There have been no adequate prospective studies to determine the optimal intake of calcium for preservation of bone mass in young or middle-aged adults, although calcium balance studies indicate that premenopausal women require approximately 1,000 mg of calcium per day. The negative calcium balance of early menopause may be ameliorated by 1,000 mg of calcium per day; however, there is no proof that greater intakes fully reverse the effects of estrogen deficiency. Calcium requirements of both elderly men and women are likely to be greater (between 1,000 and 1,500 mg per day) due to an age-related decrease in the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption. The optimal level of weight-bearing exercise for maintenance of bone mass in old age is probably similar to that of an active young adult. Maintenance of this activity level in middle and old age improves bone mass. An exercise prescription for elderly individuals must include an appraisal of cardiovascular and muscular-skeletal health and be designed to minimize the risk of trauma during exercise.\r"

Blood pressure was measured in 378 normal volunteers and 198 patients with essential hypertension after an intravenous infusion of normal saline and after sodium and volume depletion. Those whose mean arterial blood pressure decreased more than 10 mm Hg after sodium and volume depletion were considered sodium-sensitive, whereas those with a decrease of less than 5 mm Hg were considered sodium resistant. The normal and hypertensive subjects were divided into groups of those above and those below 40 years of age. The blood pressure responses of both older and younger groups were normally distributed, indicating that blood pressure could either decrease or increase following volume depletion. Older hypertensive and normotensive subjects are more likely to be sodium sensitive. They usually have lower renin values than do younger subjects, but substantial heterogeneity is found. Age and renin status do not reliably predict sodium sensitivity. Volume contraction and dietary sodium restriction are more likely to decrease blood pressure in older than in younger subjects, but regimens must be tailored individually.\r"

Seven patients received 5 mg of OKT3 monoclonal antibody intravenously per day for 10 to 14 days. Diagnosis of moderate or severe rejection was made in all seven from right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Biopsy was repeated 48 to 72 hours and seven to 10 days after OKT3 monoclonal antibody was begun. With treatment, four patients had a complete response, with improvement on both early and late biopsy. Two patients had partial responses, with improvement on early biopsy followed by worsening rejection on late biopsy. One patient died of graft failure six hours after receiving OKT3 monoclonal antibody. Adverse events were common in the first two days of therapy but were well tolerated. It is concluded that OKT3 monoclonal antibody is useful in the treatment of refractory cardiac allograft rejection.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of variations in dietary carbohydrate and fat intake on various aspects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were studied in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Two test diets were utilized, and they were consumed in random order over two 15-day periods. One diet was low in fat and high in carbohydrate, and corresponded closely to recent recommendations made by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), containing (as percent of total calories) 20 percent protein, 20 percent fat, and 60 percent carbohydrate, with 10 percent of total calories as sucrose. The other diet contained 20 percent protein, 40 percent fat, and 40 percent carbohydrate, with sucrose accounting for 3 percent of total calories. Although plasma fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were similar with both diets, incremental glucose and insulin responses from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. were higher (p less than 0.01), and mean (+/- SEM) 24-hour urine glucose excretion was significantly greater (55 +/- 16 versus 26 +/- 4 g/24 hours p less than 0.02) in response to the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. In addition, fasting and postprandial triglyceride levels were increased (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were reduced (p less than 0.02) when patients with NIDDM ate the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. Finally, since low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations did not change with diet, the HDL/LDL cholesterol ratio fell in response to the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. These results document that low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets, containing moderate amounts of sucrose, similar in composition to the recommendations of the ADA, have deleterious metabolic effects when consumed by patients with NIDDM for 15 days. Until it can be shown that these untoward effects are evanescent, and that long-term ingestion of similar diets will result in beneficial metabolic changes, it seems prudent to avoid the use of low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets containing moderate amounts of sucrose in patients with NIDDM.\r"

From the patient's perspective, the most prominent adverse effects of chemotherapy are nausea and vomiting. Inadequate control of these symptoms leads to physiologic debilitation and psychologic distress, sequelae that result in either the patient being medically unable to continue therapy or noncompliant. Recent antiemetic research has created a voluminous data base from which the appropriate management of many aspects of chemotherapy-induced emesis can be gleaned. Despite these advances, at least 30% of patients continue to experience some degree of acute emesis with chemotherapy, and the problems of delayed and anticipatory nausea and vomiting have just begun to be addressed. Effective management of chemotherapy-induced emesis is an important aspect of the total care of oncologic patients, improving patient compliance and enhancing the therapeutic index of chemotherapy regimens resulting in a decrease in the overall morbidity and mortality of cancer therapy.\r"

Following heart transplantation, the 1-year survival rate is now greater than 80%, and the 5-year survival rate is more than 60% at major medical centers. More than 1,200 heart transplants were performed in more than nine countries worldwide in 1985. The failure of medicare to pay for this procedure is no longer defensible on medical grounds. The argument in favor of medicare funding for heart transplantation is at least as compelling as that for kidney dialysis, the treatment of cancer, or AIDS. The limited availability of donor organs (at most, 1300-2000/year) is likely to place a finite constraint on the number of heart transplants that can and will be performed. Although combined heart-lung transplantation is feasible therapy for certain patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, the availability of suitable donors poses an even greater restriction on this procedure. Totally implantable ventricular assist devices are on the horizon. These devices have the potential for helping 17,000 to 35,000 patients annually at an estimated cost to society of $2.5 to $5 billion per annum. The development and use of such extremely expensive technology poses major socioeconomic and ethical questions for society.\r"

Acute GN developed in LKs with proteinuria, deposition of human and rat IgG and C3, leukocyte infiltration, and capillary wall electron-dense deposits.

Clonal T-cell populations, as evidenced by rearranged DNA bands, were demonstrated in the skin lesions of four patients, one of whom has shown clinical progression toward lymphoma. Three of these patients had lesions of type A histology, a type previously shown to be associated with aneuploidy. The remaining patient with clonal lesions appeared to have the same gene rearrangement pattern in DNA obtained from separate lesions taken 11 months apart, providing evidence that the T cells in both sites were derived from the same clone. This patient had lesions of type B histology, which is not associated with aneuploidy. Absence of a rearranged band and deletion or near absence of the 10.8 kb band in Eco RI digests was interpreted as evidence of polyclonal T-cell hyperplasia, accounting for the skin infiltrate of a fifth patient who had a prolonged clinical course without progression to lymphoma. This patient had lesions of type A histology with frequent Ki-1-positive Reed-Sternberg-like cells. Our results show that gene rearrangement analysis provides information that is independent of histology in LyP and may in part explain the variable progression of LyP to lymphoma in 10-20% of patients.\r"

  ".W": "This is the third report in a series on the inflammatory mediators and modulators released in organ culture from skin lesions of various ages, which were produced in vivo in rabbits by the military vesicant, sulfur mustard (SM). It describes the electrophoretic protein fractions and trypsin-inhibitory capacities of the various culture fluids and the amounts of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha-macroglobulin proteinase inhibitors in these fluids. With one-dimensional electrophoresis, the albumin and beta-globulin fractions of protein in culture fluids varied little with the development and healing of the SM lesions. These fractions proportionally resembled the corresponding fractions found in serum. The alpha 1-globulin fraction was proportionally smaller than the corresponding fractions of serum as the lesions healed. The alpha 2-globulin fraction was proportionally smaller than the corresponding fractions of serum at all stages of lesion development and healing. The gamma-globulin fraction was proportionally larger as the lesions healed. With two-dimensional electrophoresis, about 68%, 46%, and 35% of the protein spots in culture fluids from representative 1-day and 6-day SM lesions and normal skin, respectively, matched those from serum. In each case, the large, diffuse, serum albumin spot represented about two-thirds of the protein present. Thus, gravimetrically, in normal skin and in both developing and healing lesions, the extracellular proteins were 80-90% of serum origin. The trypsin-inhibitory capacity (TIC) per milligram protein in the culture fluids of healing lesions was markedly less than the TIC per milligram protein in the fluids of peak lesions. This decrease correlates well with the decrease found in the alpha 1-globulin fraction, which contains alpha 1-antiproteinase (alpha 1-PI) (and alpha 1-macroglobulin [alpha 1M] in rabbits). The alpha 1PI and the alpha 1M-alpha 2M proteinase inhibitors were identified in the culture fluids by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blots, specific antibodies, and the immuno-peroxidase technique. The levels of both free and proteinase-complexed alpha 1PI and alpha M inhibitors in the culture fluids decreased as the lesions healed. In both developing and healing lesions, at least half of the alpha 1PI and alpha M inhibitors seemed to be complexed with proteinases. Thus, serum seems to be a major source of unbounded extracellular protein within acute inflammatory lesions, and serum proteinase inhibitors seem to be the host's major defense against local damage by proteinases from serum, infiltrating leukocytes, and activated fibroblasts.\r"

With the use of specific fluorescent probe (NBD-phallacidin), the distribution of actin filaments are compared in normal dermis and in several wound contraction models, including open and burn wounds and full and thin-thickness skin autografts. Fibroblasts of normal dermis are slightly stained with NBD-phallacidin. Fibroblasts with actin filaments are increased in autografts, particularly at Days 15 and 21 after grafting, and are prominent in open and burn wounds. The wound contraction rate is not directly related to the presence of actin-staining fibroblasts. After stabilization of the contraction of open or burn wounds, fibroblasts rich in actin filaments remain. The superficial layer of full-thickness skin graft contains a similar actin distribution without concomitant contraction. It is concluded that the distribution of actin-rich fibroblasts corresponds morphologically to previous areas of necrosis or injury.\r"

Immunocytochemical analysis of methanol-Carnoy's-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue revealed that this antibody, termed HHF35, reacts with skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and myoepithelial cells, but is nonreactive with endothelial, epithelial, neural, or connective tissue cells. When assayed by indirect immunofluorescence, HHF35 reacts with microfilament bundles from various cultured mammalian smooth muscle cells, but does not react with cultured human dermal fibroblasts or various epithelial tumor cell lines. In one-dimensional gel electrophoresis immunoblot experiments this antibody detects a 42-kd polypeptide from tissue extracts of uterus, ileum, aorta, diaphragm, and heart and extract from smooth muscle cells. The antibody also reacts with a comigrating 42-kd band of highly purified rabbit skeletal muscle actin. HHF35 is nonreactive on immunoblots of extracts from all tested nonmuscle cell extracts. Immunoelectrophoresis followed by immunoblotting performed in the presence of urea and reducing agents reveals recognition of the alpha isoelectrophoretic variant of actin from skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle sources and of the gamma variant from smooth muscle sources. Because HHF35 reacts with virtually all muscle cells, it will be useful as a marker for muscle and muscle-derived cells.\r"

Persistent infection could be initiated in both newborn and adult mice. For newborns, inoculation with any of several strains of LCMV (Armstrong, E350, Pasteur, Traub or WE) caused continuous infection, but such infection of adults required a selected lymphotropic variant of LCMV Armstrong (Clone 13). Throughout these animals' lives, viral materials (nucleic acid sequences and proteins) accumulated in multiple tissues, including the beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans; infectious virus was present in blood and tissues, and the LCMV-specific H-2 restricted CTL response was poor. Adult mice that had been inoculated with virus as newborns displayed neither histopathologic injury nor infiltrates of mononuclear cells in the islets of Langerhans despite moderate viral replication in beta-cells. In contrast, mice inoculated as adults with Clone 13 LCMV consistently developed inflammatory infiltrates in perivascular spaces of the islets of Langerhans, and their beta-cells expressed LCMV antigens. Addition of a subdiabetogenic dose of streptozotocin, a specific beta-cell toxin, magnified the virus-induced abnormality in glucose metabolism. This indicated a potentiating role between persistent virus infection initiated at birth or in adulthood and an environmental factor in causing abnormalities in glucose metabolism.\r"

One of five Wilms' tumors revealed more numerous renin-containing tumor cells than the adjacent renal cortex, whereas three of ten renal adenocarcinomas and two of three renal oncocytomas revealed only focally renin-positive tumor cell cytoplasms. None of six cortical adenomas were positive for renin. With available fresh tumor tissue, renin activity was studied by measuring newly formed angiotensin I by radioimmunoassay. JG tumor contained markedly elevated renin activity, whereas one Wilms' tumor and two renal adenocarcinomas contained no more than 2% of renin activity of the renal cortex, more than 50% of which was inactive renin. These findings suggest that the JG tumor elaborates enormous amounts of active renin, whereas other renal tumors produce lesser amounts of renin, more than half of which is inactive renin.\r"

Patients were divided into early and late repair groups and their charts reviewed to determine common clinical features. A new method of repair with early functional range of motion exercises before casting was used and compared to other techniques in common use. Thirty-one patients were contacted for long-term followup (average, 4.7 years). Twenty-three of these patients returned for intensive reevaluation and Cybex testing. We found a high incidence of gout (14.3%) and previous steroid injections (7.1%) in our patients. Good results were obtained from the four surgical methods used. There were no reruptures and only 7% of the patients experienced minor wound problems. Patients treated with early functional range of motion exercises averaged 12.5 degrees more dorsiflexion at the time of cast removal and did not require adjunctive protective devices. Long-term results, however, revealed equilibration of range of motion and near normal function in all repair techniques with 88% of all patients returning to preinjury activity levels.\r"

We isolated HIV from 27 (77%) of 35 patients with AIDS, and 5 of 9 patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC). Virus was also isolated from plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients in the study. The presence of antibody was a reliable marker for virus infection in African patients with AIDS. HIV was isolated from 5 of 27 control patients without AIDS, 3 of whom had normal T helper to T suppressor ratios and normal numbers of T helper cells. Two of these patients had no detectable antibody to HIV by ELISA or Western blot methods. In a population, such as the general heterosexual population of Kinshasa, with frequent infection by HIV and with few clearly definable risk groups, screening for antibodies to HIV may not be sufficient to identify some virus infected persons.\r"

Complement fixation and neutralization tests were used to identify the California serogroup virus as a subtype of Melao virus, the Bunyamwera serogroup virus as a subtype of both Maguari and Playas viruses, and the vesiculovirus as a newly recognized agent for which the name Calchaqui virus is proposed. A limited serosurvey of horses and humans in Santa Fe Province and horses from the adjacent Santiago del Estero Province was performed to determine the prevalence of neutralizing antibody to the subtypes of Melao and Maguari viruses and to Calchaqui virus. The high prevalence of antibodies to these three agents indicates the need for further studies of their disease potential in horses, because they are closely related to several other viruses that are known equine pathogens.\r"

Two monoclonal antibodies (specific for 50 and 47 Kd exoantigens, respectively) were used to immunoprecipitate culture supernatants and parasitized erythrocytes in each case. It was observed that all the parasite isolates reacted with both monoclonal antibodies, indicating the ubiquity of the epitopes analyzed. Further, two of the exoantigens (the 50 and 18 Kd of FCR-3) were found to have a stable molecular mass in all the isolates tested, whereas, the other one (47 Kd in FCR-3) was found to have a variable molecular mass, from 47 to 50 Kd. The molecular mass of the precursor varied from 126 Kd to 128 Kd. No correlation was found between geographic origin and antigenic size.\r"

In a village based study, there was initial clearing of parasitemia in each patient. However, recrudescent infection occurred in all five patients receiving amodiaquine (RI resistance). Five of six falciparum infections were sensitive to chloroquine, while parasitemia reappeared in one patient. In this village, resistance to amodiaquine was significantly more common than resistance to chloroquine (P less than 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first report of amodiaquine being substantially worse than chloroquine in the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infection.\r"

Colombian stocks were collected in three ecologically and epidemiologically distinct settings. Thirteen enzymes were included in the evaluation. Sixteen different phenotypic profiles or \"zymodemes\" were evident and generated three groups of closely related stocks: a sylvatic Z1-like group, a domiciliary Z1-like group, and a sylvatic Z3-like group. The number of zymodemes observed in foci of sylvatic transmission was greater than in foci of domiciliary transmission. Modified ecologic conditions associated with agriculture and the consequent reduction of biologic diversity may account for the observed pattern of zymodeme distribution and heterogeneity. The phenotypic similarity between the principal sylvatic group of stocks and domiciliary stocks contrasts with the extensive differences observed between the domestic Z2 zymodeme and sylvatic Z1 and Z3 zymodemes in Brazil and Chile.\r"

Of 312 patients with ocular complaints examined at the village outpatient clinics, 100 (32%) had trachoma infections. Monoclonal FA staining showed higher sensitivity in detecting positive cases of trachoma than did Giemsa staining.

The procedure was carried out by a specially trained member of the surgical team, thus providing use of the technique as required. In assessing the degree of reliability of ultrasonography for surgical decision-making, it was found to be helpful in arriving at a decision in 47 patients, not helpful in 3 patients, and misleading in 2 patients in whom results were misinterpreted. The use of ultrasonography by the surgical team may help to provide early diagnosis, and thus may shorten the delay in necessary surgical intervention. It can also serve as a guide during interventional procedures and thereby can increase their safety and accuracy. We believe that the ability to carry out and interpret ultrasonographic tests is a helpful addition to the surgeon's armamentarium.\r"

Which, if any, of these methods will be appropriate for an individual patient depends on the type of stones, whether they are in the gallbladder or bile ducts, whether access to the biliary tree is available, the patient's age and general medical condition, and the availability of expert radiologists, endoscopists, and newer equipment. In the United States, the only available oral bile salt for cholesterol gallstone dissolution is chenodeoxycholate. Ursodeoxycholate, which is more rapid and less toxic, has not been approved by the Federal Drug Administration. These agents are most effective in thin women with small, floating, radiolucent cholesterol gallstones in a functioning gallbladder. Only about half of this small subset of patients, however, will experience partial or complete dissolution of stones in 6 to 12 months. Moreover, recurrence is very likely, and the potential toxicity of long-term therapy is unknown. Thus, for most patients, cholecystectomy remains the most cost-effective and, perhaps, safest option. Intragallbladder instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether and extracorporeal shock wave therapy are also likely to be applicable to only small subsets of patients and to be associated with high recurrence rates. In patients with retained ductal cholesterol stones and access to the biliary tree, mono-octanoin therapy is advantageous in that it can be begun as soon as cholangiography demonstrates no extravasation. In properly selected patients, a 90 percent success rate with mono-octanoin infusion can be expected within a week. Radiologic or endoscopic extraction techniques require maturation of a relatively straight T-tube tract but are not dependent on the type of stone. In the hands of experts, these techniques are highly successful. In postcholecystectomy patients without access to the biliary tree, endoscopic sphincterotomy has become the preferred method of management and can be expected to succeed in more than 90 percent of patients. At this point, the exact role for ultrasonic or electrohydraulic lithotripsy and lasers is unknown. However, these techniques may be applicable in the future in patients with retained bile duct stones in whom extraction and infusion techniques have failed.\r"

Alcoholism can affect the absorption, storage, metabolism, and activation of many of these vitamins. Possible factors which cause alterations in the absorption, storage, and metabolism of these vitamins are discussed. Suggestions for management of vitamin deficiencies in chronic alcoholics are also discussed.\r"

Potential manifestations of zinc deficiency include skin lesions, hypogonadism, impaired night vision, impaired immune function, anorexia, altered protein metabolism, diarrhea, and depressed mental function. Because of the variety of ways in which zinc deficiency may present in alcoholic liver disease, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for this nutrient deficiency when caring for these patients. Not only may zinc deficiency occur with alcoholic liver disease, but there also may be altered zinc metabolism. Recent data from alcoholic hepatitis patients demonstrate increased serum levels of the monokine interleukin 1, which is known to cause hypozincemia and an internal redistribution of zinc. This monokine has a host of metabolic functions other than its effect on mineral metabolism that have relevance for alcoholic liver disease such as fever production, neutrophilia, and muscle catabolism. We suggest that the patient with alcoholic liver disease frequently has problems with either zinc deficiency or altered zinc metabolism and the potential implications of this are discussed.\r"

The evidence depends on a number of related lines of evidence: hypomagnesemia, a number of clinical symptoms in common with patients with nonalcoholic causes of magnesium deficiency, induction of magnesium excretion by alcohol ingestion (167-260% of control values), positive magnesium balance on alcohol withdrawal (average 1.15 meq/kg), decreased exchangeable magnesium (28Mg, mean deficit 1.12 meq/kg), a mean deficit of 11.4 meq/kg of fat-free dry weight of muscle of alcoholic patients, and hypocalcemia responsive only to magnesium therapy. When alcohol is withdrawn, free fatty acids rise sharply and plasma magnesium falls. Respiratory alkalosis occurs abruptly also on alcohol withdrawal. The alkalosis and rise of free fatty acids with concomitant fall of magnesium produces an acute instability of the internal milieu and could result in acute symptoms. There also are a number of nutritional deficiencies which need to be cared for, but magnesium, thiamine, and other B vitamins need to be administered immediately. Potassium and phosphorus should be supplied when they are low.\r"

The results show that the MR/N strain (2 and 5 months old), which elicits enhanced locomotor stimulation after low doses of ethanol, also demonstrates significant increases in cholinergic function at the time of behavioral stimulation. However, after locomotor stimulation, cholinergic parameters returned to normal in these animals. Strains which do not show enhanced locomotor activity after ethanol did not demonstrate significant central cholinergic changes. We conclude that central cholinergic function is related to behavioral stimulation elicited by low doses of ethanol in the MR/N rat strain but not other strains.\r"

The mean value of lipase activity was increased to 1213 +/- 229 milliunits/10(12) RBC in the alcoholics as compared with a value of 997 +/- 120 milliunits/10(12) RBC in the controls (p less than 0.001). The lipase increase was associated with increased values of the mean cellular volume of RBC. A subgroup (64%) of 32 alcoholic subjects with macrocytosis (mean cellular volume greater than 96 femtoliters) showed the highest mean lipase activity (1276 +/- 224 milliunits/10(12) RBC) as compared with a value of 1101 +/- 196 milliunits/10(12) RBC in the normocytic alcoholic subgroup (p less than 0.05). This latter subgroup had a mean value higher (p less than 0.05) than that in the control group. The relationship between values of mean cellular volume and lipase activity was not of predictive value in individual cases. The enzymatic increase was not related to a direct effect of alcohol on the intact RBC. It is postulated that this alteration might result from changes in the chemical and/or physical state of the plasma membrane induced by ethanol during RBC formation. In any event, the increased lipolytic activity of RBC represents a new biological characteristic of alcoholic subjects. Its determination might represent a noninvasive way of evaluating the influence of alcohol on a tissue parameter.\r"

Triacylglycerols were elevated 57% in the high ethanol group as compared to controls, but cholesterol level was not altered. Most of the phospholipids, including lysophospholipids, showed a small increase in level after ethanol administration. However the greatest increase (50%) occurred in ethanolamine plasmalogens. Although small changes in the acyl group composition of phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylcholines were observed, the acyl group profile of cardiolipin remained unaltered. It is concluded that myocardial membranes respond to the disordering effects of ethanol by altering the synthesis of selected lipids more than through altering the phospholipid acyl group composition. Some of these changes may be responsible for altered mitochondrial functions in the myocardium.\r"

The latter eight patients had mainly lactic acidosis (plasma lactate 2.0-13.3 mmol/liter). Most of the ketotic patients did not have ethanol detected in their blood. The presence of starvation was supported by the finding of subnormal plasma triiodothyronine levels (less than 90 micrograms/dl) in six of seven ketotic patients (average 60 micrograms/dl for all seven). The ketotic patients usually had low-normal plasma insulin levels (3- 16 microU/ml), as is common in starvation. Our findings support the previously undocumented belief that most patients with alcoholic ketosis did stop drinking ethanol some time before admission, and that starvation is a major pathogenetic factor in the disorder.\r"

A 2.0 g/kg test dose resulted in 92, 48, and 2.7% depression from baseline of motor coordination test performance, startle response, and rectal temperature, respectively, on the first test day. There was complete tolerance to the hypothermic effect of this dose of ethanol on the 9th day of treatment while 17 days of treatment were required to achieve total tolerance on dowel test but still did not produce full tolerance on the startle response. Measurement of blood ethanol concentration indicated no significant changes in the rate of ethanol disappearance. Therefore the observed decrease in sensitivity to ethanol represents functional tolerance. These results indicate tolerance to ethanol develops at different rates depending on the measures employed to evaluate it.\r"

Five major ADH isozymes were resolved and distinguished on the basis of their isoelectric points, tissue distributions, relative activities with alcohol substrates, and sensitivities to inhibition with 4-methyl pyrazole. ADH-1 and ADH-2 exhibited class I kinetic properties and were observed in high activity in kidney and liver extracts, respectively. ADH-3 showed class II kinetic properties, exhibiting high activity in stomach extracts, and was widely distributed in extracts of other baboon tissues, including kidney, esophagus, heart, testis, brain, and male sex accessory tissues. ADH-4 also showed class II ADH properties but was found only in liver (similar to human \"pi-ADH\"). ADH-5 exhibited class III ADH kinetic properties, being inactive with ethanol up to 0.5 M (similar to human \"chi-ADH\") and was distributed widely in baboon tissue extracts. Major activity variation was observed for liver ADH-4 between different animals. An electrophoretic variant for ADH-3 was observed for the enzyme in stomach, kidney, and testis extracts, and activity variation existed for this isozyme in kidney extracts. It is apparent that baboon ADH shares a number of features with the human ADH phenotype; however, several species-specific differences were observed, particularly for the liver and kidney class I isozymes and for stomach ADH.\r"

Each subject attempted to determine which of a set of stimuli (objects, letters, or numbers) the examiner had arbitrarily preselected as correct. The nonalcoholic control subjects asked constraint-seeking questions which reduced alternatives by inquiring about general categories (e.g., \"Is it a tool?\"). In contrast, the two groups of alcoholic patients assumed the far less efficient strategy of asking hypothesis-scanning and pseudo-constraint questions which provided information only about one of the possible stimuli (e.g., \"Is it the saw?\"). This similarity in the problem-solving strategies of alcoholics both with and without Korsakoff's syndrome is consistent with the hypothesis that the problem-solving deficits of Korsakoff patients are apparent before the acute onset of their amnesic symptoms. These deficits may be due to alcohol-induced damage to the anterior and posterior cerebral cortical association areas which mediate problem-solving and visuoperceptual functions.\r"

Using responses to questionnaire and structured interview questions on alcohol-related problems, DSM III diagnoses are constructed; approximately three-quarters of the sample are diagnosed with sufficient severity for a DSM III diagnosis of abuse or dependence. Self-reported consumption levels and drinking/driving incidents increase as the level of the alcohol problem increases; persons in the Alcohol Abuse category are heavier consumers and drive more frequently after drinking than are persons who are not diagnosed by the DSM III as having an alcohol problem. Persons in the Alcohol Dependence category are heavier consumers than either the Alcohol Abuse or Undiagnosed Problem categories and report more drinking/driving incidents. The DSM III provides useful subcategories of convicted drinking drivers referred for alcoholism evaluation and distinguishes groups differing in quality, frequency, and self-reported DWI measures, independent of basic demographics. These analyses suggest that drinking/driving countermeasures should include intervention efforts to address alcohol-related problems. Serious alcohol problems exist among some drinking drivers, and drinking/driving incidents are more frequent among these individuals.\r"

Recent research in this area has yielded descriptive data mostly on nonalcoholic drinkers' motives for drinking and alcohol expectancies. Much less attention has been focused on assessing the extent to which these findings generalize to a broader array of drinkers. Alcohol expectancies were assessed in this report among 260 alcoholics, 79 problem drinkers, and 81 nonproblem drinkers (all subjects were male) using a comprehensive alcohol expectancy measure. Alcoholics almost uniformly scored higher than the problem and nonproblem drinkers in their endorsements of alcohol's effects in different domains (e.g., alcohol acts as a global positive transforming agent, enhances physical and social pleasure, engenders assertiveness, reduces tension). Problem drinkers also tended to score higher than the nonproblem drinkers in these domains. A multiple discriminant analysis yielded two functions which together were moderately successful in classifying these subjects according to drinker group. Taken together, these data suggest that important individual differences exist in drinkers' expectations regarding alcohol's utility, and that alcohol expectancies vary considerably as a function of problem drinking severity. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

Following exposure to control or ethanol diets for 7 or 14 days, we measured respiration rates, body temperature, acoustic startle responses, and heart rates in Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice to determine how initial alcohol sensitivity influences dependence liability. SS mice consumed a greater amount of ethanol diet and exhibited a more severe withdrawal syndrome than LS mice. Withdrawal severity resulted from an interaction of genotype with duration of ethanol exposure. The abstinence syndrome was generally characterized by depressed behavioral and physiological functioning for both mouse lines. Initial alcohol sensitivity influenced the rate of alcohol increase in the blood during dependence induction which, in turn, influenced withdrawal severity. This model incorporates several discriminative measures that independently assess withdrawal reactions and provides a useful animal model of alcohol withdrawal.\r"

All nine patients receiving vitamin K lowered the abnormal prothrombin level significantly whereas there was no change in those 11 who did not receive vitamin K. The prothrombin time by the one-stage technique was normal in all patients.

The aldehydes derived from dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) and serotonin (5-hydroxy-3-acetaldehyde) were prepared as stable disulfite complexes, from which free aldehydes were extracted. Serotonin and 5-hydroxy-3-acetaldehyde caused pronounced depression of firing rates both of cerebellar Purkinje neurons and neurons in prefrontal cortex. When locally applied from multibarrel micropipettes by pressure ejection, 5-hydroxy-3-acetaldehyde was twice as potent in the neocortex as in the cerebellum, and was equipotent with serotonin in both brain areas. The aldehyde of tryptamine also caused depressions of neuronal activity in cerebellum, but only at 5-fold higher doses than were effective for 5-hydroxy-3-acetaldehyde. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde was without effect in prefrontal cortex, but had mixed responses in the cerebellum. The results show that monoamine-derived aldehydes are physiologically active. It is possible that changes in the steady state level of these aldehydes caused by drugs such as ethanol and barbiturates might influence the electrophysiological properties of neurons in the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Previously published studies investigating the oral benzodiazepine ethanol interaction have utilized a single dose of ethanol, a single dose of oral benzodiazepine, and measured plasma benzodiazepine concentration over varying time periods. Most studies reported an increase or no change in benzodiazepine plasma concentrations following ethanol administration, which the investigators usually ascribed to an ethanol-induced increase in the benzodiazepine absorption rate constant. However, ethanol decreases the hepatic clearance of benzodiazepines that are biotransformed via the P450 enzyme system and this effect was not taken into account in evaluation of the results of these studies. Computer simulations have been used to investigate possible mechanisms of the oral benzodiazepine-ethanol interaction. The effects of a constant or transient decrease in clearance and an increase in absorption rate constant upon maximum concentration, time of maximum concentration, and area under the benzodiazepine plasma concentration curve (AUC) have been examined. A transient 75% decrease in benzodiazepine clearance resulted in a 13.6% increase in AUC (0-36 hr), a 3.4% increase in Cmax and a 5.7% increase in tmax. These changes are qualitatively consistent with, but quantitatively shy, of those observed in most studies. Consequently, an effect of ethanol upon benzodiazepine absorption must still be considered.\r"

A fourth group of rats fed high fat (32% of calories) and a diet marginal in protein, vitamins and minerals was also studied. Control rats were pair-fed dextrose in isocaloric amounts. For rats fed diets containing 5, 25, 32, and 35% fat, the average blood alcohol levels achieved were 216, 224, 266 and 353 mg/100 ml, respectively. Average weight gains of the ethanol fed rats were: 15.4, 19.6, 14.7, and 14.9 g/week, respectively. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of the ethanol-fed rats averaged 123, 292, 144, and 213 units/liter, respectively. ALT levels in pair-fed controls for the rats fed 32% fat averaged 62 and those of chow-fed controls averaged 49 units/liter. Comparison of liver biopsy-semiquantified morphological findings revealed an increased 3-4+ fatty change in the ethanol-fed rats also fed the high fat rats. Moreover, fibrosis was only observed centrilobularly in rats fed diets with varying fat content (5, 25, 32, or 35% of calories): 0/16, 10/17, 4/6, and 3/7 rats, respectively, over a 5-mon period of feeding. Electron microscopy showed that ito cells predominated in the scarred areas. The mechanism for the centrilobular necrosis-fibrosis was investigated in rats given a diet of ethanol plus 32% fat diet by measuring the level of adenine nucleotide in repeated liver biopsies in five pair of rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By contrast, addition of ethanol directly to the enzyme after its partial purification had no effect on the enzyme activity. The increase in erythrocyte aldehyde dehydrogenase activity following acute ethanol administration is directly opposite to the effect of chronic ethanol consumption in decreasing the enzyme activity in alcoholics. The mechanism for this effect is unknown but may be related to alterations in the erythrocyte membrane and its interaction with the enzyme.\r"

From findings on the distribution, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action of P-450ALC we have suggested \"alcohol P-450 oxygenase\" as a more biochemically accurate name than \"microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system.\" The present review is concerned with studies in this and other laboratories on activities and inducers associated with this versatile enzyme. Numerous xenobiotics, including alcohols and ketones, nitrosamines, aromatic compounds, and halogenated alkanes, alkenes, and ethers, are known to undergo increased microsomal metabolism after chronic exposure of various species to ethanol. Diverse compounds and treatments may induce P-450ALC, including the administration of ten or more chemically different compounds, fasting, or the diabetic state. Whether a common mechanism of induction is involved is unknown at this time. As direct evidence that P-450ALC catalyzes numerous metabolic reactions, the purified rabbit enzyme has been used in a reconstituted system to demonstrate various metabolic transformations, including the oxidation of various alcohols, acetone, acetol, p-nitrophenol, and aniline, the dealkylation of substituted nitrosamines, the reductive dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride, carbon tetrachloride-induced lipid peroxidation, and acetaminophen activation to form the glutathione conjugate.\r"

  ".W": "The application of radiolabeled fatty acids to measurements of fatty acid oxidation is discussed and a method for measuring the rate of beta-oxidation and of acetyl-CoA oxidation to CO2 is described. In hepatocytes from starved or fed rats, ethanol inhibited total beta-oxidation in the presence of 1.3 mM palmitate by 22% and 25%, respectively. If changes in the specific radioactivity of acetyl-CoA were not corrected for, the effect of ethanol would have been overestimated by 15% and underestimated by 15% in hepatocytes from fed and starved rats, respectively. In perfused liver from fed rats, inhibition by ethanol of total beta-oxidation in the presence of 1 mM palmitate was 35%. The rate of beta-oxidation in the absence of ethanol was underestimated by 65% if proper corrections were not applied. Inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle by ethanol was 57% and 72% in hepatocytes from starved and fed rats, respectively. Pyrazole titration experiments demonstrated a correlation between changes in the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio and both inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and inhibition of the beta-oxidation pathway. The concentration of acetoacetyl-CoA is suggested as an additional regulatory factor of the beta-oxidation pathway. The ethanol-induced accumulation of triacylglycerol as a consequence of the inhibition of the beta-oxidation pathway is estimated to represent a 10% increase in the cellular triacylglycerol pool/hr/g of wet weight. Hence its chemical determination requires experiments of several hours duration. Primary cultures of hepatocytes have been shown to be a useful experimental system for studies of the ethanol-induced triacylglycerol accumulation.\r"

The deuterium isotope effect was measured using (1-R)-[1-14C,1-2H]ethanol. A value of 2.57 +/- 0.09 (SD) was obtained independent of the direction of perfusion. Oxygen uptake and ethanol metabolism in contrast were significantly increased when reverse perfusion (i.e., from vena cava to vena portae) was used. The magnitude of the isotope effect indicates that contribution from microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system if this is the only supplementary system is 9.8% under the experimental conditions. At high ethanol concentrations, the contribution would approach 18%. Equal activities of microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system and catalase under the experimental conditions would mean that both contribute 7.3% of the total ethanol metabolism. At high ethanol concentrations (80 mM), however, catalase will be 6.8% and microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system is calculated to 13.3%. Preliminary experiments with rats pretreated with phenobarbital showed no change in the isotope effect or in the rate of ethanol metabolism, but a 40-50% increase in oxygen consumption. The acetaldehyde concentration in the effluent medium was below 1 microM.\r"

Ethanol has been found to be a potent inducer of microsomal enzymes involved in carcinogen metabolism in a variety of rat tissues including liver, esophagus, lungs, and intestines. In some of these tissues, ethanol's inductive effect on microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme activity may result in enhanced levels of electrophilic metabolites of procarcinogens which are not readily detoxified. In addition, chronic ethanol feeding has been found to depress the activity of O6-methylguanine transferase, an enzyme involved in the repair of carcinogen-induced DNA alkylation. The effects of ethanol on carcinogen metabolism and on DNA repair would be expected to enhance the initiation phase of chemically induced cancers.\r"

In each case catheter or needle misplacement had resulted in a lethal intrathecal or intravascular injection. In this review these cases and a number of other similar but nonfatal reports are examined. In many cases, essential safety checks such as the aspiration test and the test dose had not been performed before the epidural injection but in others one or both of these tests had been used and had failed to predict the complication. Safety test failures generally occurred because ineffective tests were used or because effective tests were inadequately interpreted. This is not surprising because although textbooks recommend a bewildering variety of test doses, they seldom give precise details as to how they should be conducted. A detailed test dose protocol is recommended, which will safely warn of epidural catheter and needle misplacement in the most effective manner possible. If the protocol is used, accidental subarachnoid and intravascular injections can be reduced to a minimum, but they will still occur. It is emphasised that these complications should not cause fatalities if trained personnel and adequate resuscitation facilities are available.\r"

Patients given buprenorphine as sublingual tablets were significantly more conscious in the immediate postoperative period (Glasgow Coma Scale) than when given buprenorphine or meperidine intramuscularly. Median pain intensity differences (PID) showed equal pain relief, whereas the summarized pain intensity differences (SPID) were significantly higher in the intramuscular buprenorphine group compared to the meperidine group. Three cases of respiratory acidosis in the meperidine group required IPPV treatment, and one case in the intramuscular buprenorphine group required treatment. Sedation and nausea were the most common side effects in all three groups. We conclude that sublingual buprenorphine is useful for relief of postoperative pain and exhibited administrative advantages, when the patients were able to cooperate.\r"

Many drugs are being evaluated in clinical trials, but at present, they are not expected to be able to rid an infected individual of HTLV-III. There is hope for an effective vaccine, but its development is not anticipated in the near future. For now, prevention of exposure is our only means of decreasing HTLV-III transmission. We will be caring for increasing numbers of patients with HTLV-III infection. Some of these patients will have AIDS or ARC. However, a much larger pool of patients will have asymptomatic, unrecognized HTLV-III infections. Therefore, all of our patients should be treated with good hygienic practices. Appropriate guidelines can help insure our safety as well as that of our patients. The evidence is overwhelming that HTLV-III is spread sexually, by injection of contaminated blood, and from mother to fetus. Our highest personal risk for becoming infected with HTLV-III is by parenteral introduction via contaminated needles or other sharp objects. We must realize that despite the routine close contact with blood and body secretions of patients inherent to our profession, we are at little risk for becoming infected. Furthermore, with care and vigilance, we can protect our patients from risk of infection with not only HTLV-III, but a wide variety of other infectious agents as well.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examines acute titration with captopril and chronic follow-up data on captopril and a diuretic in patients with all forms of hypertension. Captopril was initiated in those patients in whom previous antihypertensive agents either failed to control high blood pressure or produced adverse reactions. Acute titration was done in 88 patients in whom average diastolic blood pressure was equal to or more than 95 mm Hg. Initial titration dosage was decided on the basis of initial blood pressure recordings. During initial titration, 5 patients received 12.5 mg, 51 received 25 mg, 28 received 50 mg, and the remaining 4 received 100 mg of captopril. Post-captopril blood pressure data were normalized by using pre-captopril data as 100% for each patient. The blood pressure-lowering effect of captopril on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in all 88 patients was statistically significant (p less than 0.05), within forty-five minutes of captopril administration irrespective of the doses. No adverse reactions were seen during the acute titration. After the initial titration, in all 88 patients a diuretic was added to obtain a synergistic effect. Eleven patients were dropped from the study, for they could not follow the requirements of the protocol. In 77 patients the data for a one-year safety profile with captopril and diuretic were available. There were no overall significant statistical changes in serial white blood cell count, serum potassium, and serum creatinine values in those 77 patients. In 31 patients the initial and maintenance dosage of captopril and the diuretic remained unaltered for one year. Post-captopril blood pressure and heart rate data were normalized, pre-captopril data being considered as 100% in those 31 patients. The blood pressure data following captopril and a diuretic therapy compared with the pre-captopril data were statistically significant (p less than 0.05) throughout the study period. However, no significant changes in heart rates were observed during the study period. In all other patients, diuretic therapy was continued throughout the study period. In 6 severely hypertensive patients, an additional beta-blocker was needed for further control of high blood pressure. In 3 severe hypertensives with renal failure, besides a diuretic and a beta-blocker, minoxidil was needed to normalize their high blood pressure. In 4 of 77 patients, verapamil was used for treatment of either vasospastic angina or paroxsysmal supraventricular arrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A number of independent authors have made this conclusion quite obvious. The authors of this review suggest that the alternating sequence of coronary spasm and dilatation should be described as the \"thromboischemic reentry mechanism,\" which itself leads to waves of reperfusion, producing characteristic episodic changes in some of the parameters of AMI. The spasms are brought about by substances let loose from aggregating platelets. Metabolites released during the concomitant ischemia lead the vessel from spasm to dilatation. Following thrombolytic treatment, the 'staccato' signs of myoglobinemia disappear, because of the withdrawal of the spasmogenic products of the platelets. It could also be shown that the concentration of myoglobin in the serum as a result of the dilating effect of calcium antagonists is twice the mean maximum value that the myoglobin time curve would show without such treatment.\r"

The sequestered, aberrant lung tissue does not have normal connections with the tracheobronchial tree or pulmonary arteries. In some patients with angiographic characteristics of this disorder, no sequestration is found at the time of surgery. We present three cases in which systemic arterialization of a portion of lung occurred without actual sequestration. Such cases of pseudosequestration can present a diagnostic challenge preoperatively and should be considered whenever angiographic findings compatible with bronchopulmonary sequestration are found.\r"

The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated in each dog, and the dogs were randomized to either placebo or CLS 2210 treatment, which was carried on for seven days. After seven days the animals were sacrificed and the volume of infarcted myocardium was determined macroscopically on a double-blind basis, supported by histologic examination. CLS 2210 treatment resulted in a highly significant reduction in the volume of infarcted myocardium (p less than 0.001). Since CLS 2210 is chemically and pharmacologically unrelated to hyaluronidase but shares an action with hyaluronidase as a cardiac lymphagogue, the results offer further support for a role of myocardial lymphatics in the evolution of myocardial necrosis following coronary artery occlusion and provide an explanation for the mechanism by which these agents reduce myocardial infarction size.\r"

Ninety-four patients were assigned randomly to treatment groups receiving nalbuphine 10 mg, nalbuphine 10 mg plus hydroxyzine 50 mg, hydroxyzine 50 mg, or placebo. The treatment groups were found to be adequately homogenous with regard to age, sex, type and duration of headaches, and history of prior narcotic use. All data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Patients who had headaches diagnosed as other than classic migraine had significantly greater pain relief with nalbuphine compared to placebo (P less than .01). The combination of nalbuphine and hydroxyzine was not significantly more effective than other treatment groups. In 20 patients with classic migraine, none of the treatment regimens significantly outperformed placebo. There were no clinically significant adverse effects attributed to the study drugs. These findings are similar to others that showed a lack of efficacy of kappa receptor agonists in classic migraineurs. Nalbuphine appears to be clinically useful in other types of severe headache. This study does not support the routine addition of hydroxyzine for presumed synergistic effect.\r"

  ".W": "The predominant mechanism of the cardiac output reduction associated with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is unclear. Reported possibilities include decreased systemic venous return, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, or change in ventricular contractility. We investigated this question by studying 9 patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during PEEP application. We used an equilibrium radionuclide angiography method modified for improved right ventricular imaging to evaluate changes in left and right ventricular volume and contractility. Thermodilution cardiac output and stroke volume progressively declined (27 and 33% mean decrease, respectively) with increasing increments of PEEP. Right and left ventricular end diastolic counts, reflecting volume, also progressively diminished as PEEP increased (38 and 27% mean decrease in RV and LV counts, respectively; p less than 0.001 for both ventricles). A slight upward trend in ejection fraction was found for both ventricles. These findings support the concept that during PEEP application the reduction in cardiac output is due to biventricular reduction in blood volume. This biventricular volume reduction is compatible with either preload reduction to both ventricles because of impeded venous return or to change in ventricular configuration caused by external compression of both ventricles.\r"

The 9 control sheep (Group A) were ventilated with 40% oxygen at a tidal volume of about 10 ml/kg and a peak inspiratory pressure of 15 to 20 cm H2O. All these animals remained stable throughout the 48 h of MV with no change in lung function. The 7 sheep in Group B were ventilated with 40% oxygen using a pressure-controlled ventilator at 50 cm H2O peak inspiratory pressure, at a VT of 50 to 70 ml/kg. All sheep in Group B developed severe respiratory failure and died or were killed within 2 to 35 h, and showed parenchymal consolidation at autopsy. The 9 sheep in Group C were ventilated as in Group B, except that 3.8% CO2 was added to the inspired gases: the Group C animals deteriorated more slowly, with little change in PaO2 but with a severely reduced FRC, VT, total static lung compliance, and grossly abnormal lungs at autopsy. We conclude that in this model, mechanical ventilation at peak airway pressure of 50 cm H2O will lead to progressive impairment in pulmonary mechanics, lung function, acute respiratory failure, and alveolar cellular dysfunction, as demonstrated by highly abnormal minimal surface tension values of saline lung lavage fluid in both study groups.\r"

Four dogs served as sham-exposed control animals. Mucus was collected 2 times/wk prior to and during the exposure period by resting a cytology brush on the lower trachea for 2 to 5 min. At least once prior to and as often as 3 times during exposure, transpulmonary pressure and flow were monitored under anesthesia to determine resistance RL. Two airway responses to methacholine were determined: the infusion response delta Ri, the increment in RL 4 to 6 min after infusion of 4 micrograms/kg/min, and the aerosol response delta Ra, the increment in RL 2 min after aerosolization of 2 mg/ml, the highest common dose reached. Eight of 9 smoking dogs developed persistent mucus hypersecretion. In 5 dogs, tracheal mucus flux increased 5- to 10-fold; in 3 dogs, the increase was 2 to 3 times that of control animals. One of the sham-exposed dogs developed moderate hypersecretion. After 10 months of smoke exposure, delta Ri increased to 2.24 times that of the initial value (+/- 0.47 SE) (n = 7, p less than 0.05), whereas delta Ra decreased to 0.28 times that of the control value (+/- 0.21 SE) (n = 6, p less than 0.02). The difference between aerosol and infusion response, delta Rai = delta Ra - delta Ri, is an index of relative hyporesponsiveness to methacholine aerosol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The arteries were graded as normal, mildly stenotic (less than 50%), moderately stenotic (around 50%), severely stenotic (50% to 99%), or occluded. There was exact correlation between the duplex and the arteriogram as to disease severity in 70.5 per cent, good correlation in 25.5 per cent, and poor correlation in 4 per cent. When the carotid duplex was combined with an OPG-Gee, the exact correlation was 76.5 per cent, good correlation was 21 per cent, and poor correlation was 2.5 per cent. The diagnostic sensitivity of the carotid duplex alone was 95.6 per cent, diagnostic specificity was 84.3 per cent, false-positive rate was 16.2 per cent, false-negative rate was 4.2 per cent, and overall accuracy was 89.5 per cent. When the carotid duplex was combined with an OPG-Gee, the diagnostic sensitivity was 96.7 per cent, diagnostic specificity was 92.6 per cent, false-positive rate was 8.2 per cent, false-negative rate was 2.9 per cent, and overall accuracy rate was 94.5 per cent. In conclusion, when the carotid duplex was combined with an OPG-Gee, there was improvement in the exact correlation (70.5% to 76.5%), the overall accuracy (89.5% to 94.5%), and the diagnostic specificity (84.3% to 92%). The status of 15 arteries was also changed, either from moderate to mild stenosis or from possible occlusion to normal.\r"

Upper-extremity evaluation of 14 patients (9 women, 5 men) indicated no abnormal studies. Response to stress showed an increase of the brachial:distal vessel ratio of 0.1 +/- 0.05; tendency of the analog velocity waveform toward triphasic; and response to stress augmented by 0.18 +/- .03 at 36 hours. Lower-extremity evaluation of 27 patients (15 women, 12 men) indicated two with thrombophlebitis. Response to stress showed an increase of the ankle: brachial ratio of .016 +/- 0.04; change in the analog velocity waveform toward triphasic; and response to stress augmented by 0.08 +/- 0.08 at 36 hours. All measurements returned to preoperative values at 7 days.

Before converting-enzyme inhibition, group B patients received higher doses of furosemide (p less than 0.02) and had lower central venous pressures (p less than 0.05) than group A patients. After 1 to 3 months of converting-enzyme inhibition, an excessive reduction in left ventricular filling pressure (to less than 15 mm Hg) or mean arterial pressure (to less than 60 mm Hg) was noted in 28 of 34 (82%) patients in group B but in only 22 of 70 patients in group A (31%) (p less than 0.001). At the end of the study, drug-induced azotemia resolved after a reduction in the dosage of diuretics, despite unaltered treatment with captopril and enalapril. Hence, the deterioration of renal function after converting-enzyme inhibition in heart failure is not a toxic or immunologic reaction to therapy but results from specific hemodynamic events that can be ameliorated by sodium repletion.\r"

The interferons have shown direct antiproliferative effects as well as specific effects on immune function. Alpha-interferon has shown impressive antitumor effects in hairy cell leukemia and significant antiviral effects in papillomavirus infection of the genital tract. Interleukin-2 has multifaceted effects on various limbs of the inflammatory and immune responses and may be the critical common denominator in the adjuvant effects of several other compounds. Monoclonal antibodies have assumed an increasing role in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to neoplastic and immune-mediated diseases.

These symptoms usually become manifest before age 40 and cluster within a few years. Most patients are obese, hypertensive men who eventually develop cardiovascular abnormalities. If sleep apnea is suspected based on clinical information, a sleep laboratory evaluation is indicated. For severe obstructive sleep apnea, tracheostomy is the most effective treatment. Narcolepsy, another sleep disorder, is a life-long and usually disabling condition. In most narcoleptic patients the first symptoms develop during childhood or adolescence, yet many years pass before the proper diagnosis is made. The presence of sleep attacks together with auxiliary symptoms, particularly cataplexy, is diagnostic. Treatment of narcolepsy includes stimulants in combination with therapeutic naps for sleep attacks and tricyclic drugs for cataplexy.\r"

In America, the literature of internal medicine evolved gradually in response to changes in the structure and philosophy of medical education and the growing emphasis on research during the past century. When careers in medical education and research became possible through philanthropic and government support, Americans became more productive in research. As academic advancement came to depend primarily on publication, the literature of American internal medicine expanded dramatically. The current scope and character of the medical literature also reflect the persistent trend toward specialization and subspecialization that began more than a century ago. Although medical journals have been the most important medium for the publication of new medical knowledge for nearly 200 years, recent dramatic advances in the technology of information storage and transfer promise to undermine their primacy.\r"

We consider the relationship between fees and costs and the criteria for judging whether a fee is appropriate or right and then propose a two-step process for constructing a relative value scale. A fee schedule based on a relative value scale is the most practical way to reform the current fee-for-service system and makes the most sense from both clinical and economic viewpoints.\r"

The chest radiograph is the best diagnostic tool but can be misinterpreted. Computed tomography sometimes discloses the cause, which appears to be bronchial obstruction in 25% of cases. The bronchial obstruction may be due to intrinsic defects or to extrinsic compression. Bronchoscopy should be performed only in certain cases and then only with careful anesthetic management.\r"

  ".W": "The carbon dioxide and neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet lasers have well documented but characteristically different biological effects, yet little is known about their cumulative, synergistic, or paradoxical effects when used sequentially on living tissue. Using a Merrimack ML 880 laser, a series of superimposed CO2 and Nd:YAG lesions in various combinations were produced on the undersurface of dog tongues. Therapeutic time and power settings were chosen and the number of applications varied, with suitable controls. Observations and measurements were made on acute, healing, and healed lesions. All lesions were excised and submitted for routine hematoxylin and eosin histology. Acute lesions were also assessed for cell viability using rhodamine 123 as a supravital marker. The results show that, even though all the lesions eventually heal, the actual cell damage produced by the Nd:YAG laser is much more than is suggested by the size of the acute lesion. This cell damage can be reduced by the surface carbonization produced by initial application of the CO2 laser. Higher surface temperatures are reached in this combination with less fibrosis and scarring than equal energy counterparts where the Nd:YAG laser was applied first. The knowledge of these synergistic effects can be used to advantage in the clinical setting. The rhodamine 123 technique also appears to be a valid measure of acute thermal tissue injury.\r"

The pure Mobius' syndrome is rare, and the involvement of the sixth and seventh nerves has been found to have a host of associated defects. These include limb and shoulder abnormalities; multiple cranial nerve defects; occasional mental retardation; external, middle, and inner ear abnormalities; laryngeal neurologic defects that cause stridor, obstruction, and aspiration; and severe dysphagia and associated aspiration with life-threatening pneumonias. The children with severe neurologic dysfunction from central nuclear deficiencies were in many respects so similar in their clinical course that they are included in this paper. All of the patients required a tracheotomy to support the airway and to permit tracheobronchial toilet. A feeding gastrostomy was necessary in all but one patient. To counter life-threatening aspiration in the patients with multiple CNS defects, the Lindeman laryngeal diversion was considered the procedure of choice and proved very effective. The details and problems of this procedure are discussed. The aural defects and laryngeal findings in this series of patients are described in detail.\r"

  ".W": "The pain of acute herpes zoster (HZ) may be severe, but it is usually transitory. A minority of patients, with the elderly at particular risk, go on to develop persistent, severe, often disabling pain called postherpetic neuralgia. Though the clinical features of these conditions are well known, the pathology of PHN is poorly described and the pathogenesis of the pain in both remains conjectural. During the past 60 years, an extraordinary number of pharmacological, anesthetic, and surgical therapies have been applied in an attempt to ameliorate the symptoms of acute herpes zoster, enhance its healing, prevent its transition to postherpetic neuralgia, and treat the pain of those with this complication. Relatively few treatments have been studied in a controlled manner, and fully reliable, safe, and effective therapeutic approaches for preventing and treating postherpetic neuralgia have not yet been found. This review summarizes current information on the epidemiology, clinical features, and pathology of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia, and critically examines the accumulated experience with the various treatments. Guidelines for management are suggested.\r"

High-resolution computed tomography with stereotaxic lesion localization permitted the determination of the thalamic nuclei involved in the infarction. We suggest that the patient's problem in language and verbal memory reflected a defect in memory processing for verbal material during registration, retention, and retrieval, and that this defect probably resulted from a left anterior thalamic lesion affecting the ventrolateral nucleus, centromedian-parafascicular nuclei complex, internal medullary lamina, or mamillothalamic tract.\r"

  ".W": "Compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, ceftriaxone produced the best lytic and bactericidal effects when each was added at about 10 times the MIC to Escherichia coli W7. When each of these antibiotics was added at its MIC, only bacteriostasis occurred, but the simultaneous addition of amdinocillin (mecillinam) was synergistic in causing rapid lysis and bactericidal effects. Induction of lysis of two E. coli mutants containing either a thermosensitive penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 or 3 by relatively PBP 3-specific (aztreonam) and PBP 2-specific (amdinocillin) antibiotics indicated that inhibition of only PBPs 2 and 3 can cause lysis. Examination of the interactions of cefotaxime, aztreonam, and cefsulodin, with or without amdinocillin, with their targets suggested that other combinations of PBPs could be involved in the onset of lysis. However, inhibition of both PBPs 2 and 3 may explain the better lysis-inducing activity of ceftriaxone (which binds well to both of these PBPs), as well as the synergistic effect of amdinocillin when added together with low concentrations of other beta-lactam antibiotics that interact with PBP 3.\r"

The respective MICs of cefixime against these strains were 0.25, 2, and 8 micrograms/ml. The clots were infected with 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/g. Groups of four animals for each strain received an intravenous injection of 100 mg of cefixime per kg over 30 min. High peak levels were observed in serum (146.5 micrograms/ml) and clots (15.8 micrograms/g), and the antibiotic was still detectable in the clots (0.6 micrograms/g) 24 h after administration. The respective serum and clot elimination half-lives were 0.7 and 5.0 h. The mean serum protein binding was 23.8 +/- 3.8%. Cefixime was highly bactericidal against K. pneumoniae and E. coli and reduced, over a 24-h period, their respective colony counts by 7.8 log10 and 6.2 log10 CFU/g of fibrin. It was less effective against S. aureus but still reduced the bacterial counts by 2.8 log10 CFU/g of fibrin. The present results demonstrate that cefixime, a new broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin, has a long tissue half-life which ensured, at the dose given here, good in vivo bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria up to 24 h after administration of the antibiotic.\r"

  ".W": "Human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III)/lymphadenopathy-associated virus is the etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex. The effect of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) on the HTLV-III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus infection was quantitatively studied with HTLV type I-carrying MT-4 cells. The AZT compound inhibited HTLV-III-induced cytopathic effect and virus-specific antigen expression in MT-4 cells at concentrations of 5 and 10 microM. In addition, a plaque-forming assay was performed to assess the effect of AZT on virus replication in MT-4 cells freshly infected with HTLV-III and in continuous HTLV-III-producing Molt-4/HTLV-III cells. Results showed that AZT efficiently and effectively inhibited the replication of HTLV-III in infected MT-4 cells. AZT is a strong inhibitor of reverse transcriptase activity of HTLV-III as a triphosphate, to such a degree that even 1.0 pM azido-TTP inhibits 50% of reverse transcriptase activity. However, it did not show any effect in the HTLV-III-producing cell line Molt-4/HTLV-III. Thus, AZT has no effect on virus replication of an already integrated virus. When 5 microM AZT was added to HTLV-III-infected MT-4 within 20 h after infection, a striking suppressive effect was noticed. This concentration was much lower than that which inhibits the growth of MT-4 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-five percent of the patients described had basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The median age of first nonmelanoma skin cancer among patients with xeroderma pigmentosum was 8 years, more than 50 years less than that among patients with skin cancer in the United States. Melanomas were reported in 5% of patients. Ninety-seven percent of the reported basal and squamous cell carcinomas and 65% of the melanomas in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum occurred on the face, head, or neck. Seventy percent probability of survival was attained at age 40 years, a 28-year reduction in comparison with the US general population. Ocular abnormalities were reported in 40% of the patients described and were restricted to tissues exposed to ultraviolet radiation (lid, conjunctiva, and cornea) and included ectropion, corneal opacity leading to blindness, and neoplasms. Neurologic abnormalities were found in 18% of the cases reported, consisting of progressive mental deterioration, hyporeflexia or areflexia, and progressive deafness in some patients in association with dwarfism and immature sexual development. There was scant information concerning the efficacy of any therapeutic regimen.\r"

The latter has been reported to have a higher frequency of antinuclear antibodies and has been associated with antibodies to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). In this study we determined the frequency of antinuclear antibodies and anti-ssDNA antibodies in 22 patients with morphea or generalized morphea. None had Raynaud's phenomenon or evidence of a systemic connective-tissue disease. Antinuclear antibodies were present in 18% of patients when serum samples were tested on mouse kidney substrate but were found in 50% of HEp-2 cells. The serum samples contained anti-ssDNA antibodies in 59% of the patients, with the highest levels of ssDNA binding observed in patients with generalized morphea. The frequency of antibodies to ssDNA was higher in patients with clinical evidence of active compared with inactive disease. Discordance in immune reactivity indicates that at least three distinctive serum autoantibodies exist in morphea and generalized morphea: anti-ssDNA antibodies and antinuclear antibodies with either homogeneous or speckled immunofluorescence patterns. These findings are similar to those recently described in linear scleroderma and suggest that comparable serum autoantibody abnormalities are present in all the variants of localized scleroderma.\r"

Three hundred and sixty eight children aged 2 to 14 years were enrolled in the study after admission to hospital for asthma. The intervention group was visited monthly by a nurse for six months. The subjects were assessed six months later by a postal, self administered questionnaire. European children in the intervention group were taking significantly more drugs for the treatment of asthma six months after the index admission to hospital than those in the control group (mean (SD) intake 2.7 (1.1) v 2.1 (1.0), respectively). In particular, they were using more theophylline (56.6% v 37.0%) and inhaled steroids (34.9% v 21.0%). There was no difference between the groups for parental reports of improvement, of missed schooling, and in severe attacks of asthma of not responding to the usual treatment at home. European children in the intervention group used the hospital services for severe attacks of asthma more than controls (34.2% v 10.5%). There were more re-admissions in the European intervention group in the subsequent six months after the index admission than in the control group (mean (SD) 0.51 (0.97) v 0.29 (0.65). Re-admission continued to be higher in the 12 months after the nurse had stopped visiting (0.81 (1.65) v 0.25 (0.65]. There was no difference in the duration of hospital stay between the intervention and control groups. For Polynesian children there was no difference between the groups for any outcome measures.\r"

These referred to small and moderate intraventricular haemorrhage, paenchymal haemorrhage, and PVL, including prolonged flare (echoes in the periventricular region lasting for two weeks or more and not becoming cystic). Sixty nine infants (34%) had no abnormality on ultrasound scans. Intraventricular haemorrhage occurred in 107 babies (37 grade I and 62 grade II), and only eight infants were thought to have true parenchymal haemorrhage. Ultrasound appearances of PVL were seen in 27 infants, 19 of whom developed cysts and eight died in the precystic stage. Prolonged flare occurred in another 25 babies. Unilateral parenchymal haemorrhage occurred in four infants who subsequently developed cystic PVL in the contralateral hemisphere. Twenty one infants developed ventricular dilatation, 12 of whom had associated parenchymal lesions. Haemorrhage, PVL, and flare occurred commonly in infants of 30 weeks' gestation and below and became markedly less common in more mature infants. We believe prolonged flare represents a form of PVL, and in this study a total of 52 (26%) infants had an ultrasound appearance of periventricular leucomalacia, an incidence considerably higher than previously reported.\r"

By contrast, the prognosis was variable and poorer in infants with PVL (n = 24) and depended on the extent and site of the lesion. Infants with frontal PVL (n = 13) developed normally. Major sequelae (n = 8) were closely related to frontal-parietal PVL and frontal-parietal-occipital PVL and could be ascribed to the presence of cysts as well as to a persistent hyperechogenic ultrasonographic PVL appearance. A relation between size and site of the lesion and type and severity of the handicap was established.\r"

Clinical symptoms and signs before adolescence are rare, but renal ultrasonography may detect evidence of cyst formation. Twenty two children, all offspring of parents with known adult polycystic kidney disease, have undergone renal ultrasonography. In six cases evidence of disease was detected without clinical manifestations at the ages of 1, 2, 5, 8, 13, and 14 years. There were no renal masses, hypertension, haematuria, or evidence of renal insufficiency. In four children from three sibships, whose families had no previous history of renal disease, bilateral renal masses were noted to be present at birth. In each case one parent was subsequently found to have adult polycystic kidney disease. At the ages of 1, 4, 6, and 20 years, while renal masses were still palpable, there was no evidence of renal insufficiency or hypertension in the younger children, while the oldest had mild renal failure. An analysis of the reported cases in childhood is suggestive of a bimodal distribution of enlarged kidneys, with a number of cases diagnosed at birth or soon after, followed by an increasing incidence during later childhood. Adult polycystic kidney disease presenting at birth may be qualitatively different from the disease detected by screening programmes of children at risk.\r"

Ninety eight per cent of the parents were receiving medication for asthma. Fifty one per cent had visited their doctor and 20% had taken more than five days off work in the previous 12 months; 12% had been admitted to hospital during the preceding 10 years. In the children the prevalences of wheeze, shortness of breath, and cough were all about double that found in a general population survey of children of similar age. Atopy was present in 90% of parents, but the prevalence of atopy among the children was not significantly different from the children in the general population. Eczema and hay fever, however, had high prevalences of 40% and 24%, respectively. Responsiveness to methacholine (provocation dose achieving 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second less than 6.4 mumol) was found in 93% of parents and 45% of children, which is compatible with a large increase compared with the general population. All atopic but only 50% of non-atopic children with symptoms of asthma responded to methacholine. These findings indicate that children who have one parent with asthma have roughly double the chance of developing clinical features of asthma compared with the general population and suggests that, in these children, a causal interaction occurs between atopy and bronchial hyper-responsiveness.\r"

Fifty-six patients who were treated with aztreonam and clindamycin (A/C) and 28 patients who were treated with gentamicin and clindamycin (G/C) fulfilled criteria for evaluation. A matched historic control group of 56 G/C patients was also included for comparison.

  ".W": "Despite the increasing use of beta-blocking agents alone as preoperative treatment of patients with hyperthyroidism, there are no controlled clinical studies in which this regimen has been compared with a more conventional preoperative treatment. Thirty patients with newly diagnosed and untreated hyperthyroidism were randomized to preoperative treatment with methimazole in combination with thyroxine (Group I) or the beta 1-blocking agent metoprolol (Group II). Metoprolol was used since it has been demonstrated that the beneficial effect of beta-blockade in hyperthyroidism is mainly due to beta 1-blockade. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses in the two groups were compared, and patients were followed up for 1 year after thyroidectomy. At the time of diagnosis, serum concentration of triiodothyronine (T3) was 6.1 +/- 0.59 nmol/L in Group I and 5.7 +/- 0.66 nmol/L in Group II (reference interval 1.5-3.0 nmol/L). Clinical improvement during preoperative treatment was similar in the two groups of patients, but serum T3 was normalized only in Group I. The median length of preoperative treatment was 12 weeks in Group I and 5 weeks in Group II (p less than 0.01). There were no serious adverse effects of the drugs during preoperative preparation in either treatment group. Operating time, consistency and vascularity of the thyroid gland, and intraoperative blood loss were similar in the two groups. No anesthesiologic or cardiovascular complications occurred during operation in either group. One patient in Group I (7%) and three patients in Group II (20%) had clinical signs of hyperthyroid function during the first postoperative day. These symptoms were abolished by the administration of small doses of metoprolol, and no case of thyroid storm occurred. Postoperative hypocalcemia or recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis did not occur in either group. During the first postoperative year, hypothyroidism developed in two patients in Group I (13%) and in six patients in Group II (40%). No patient had recurrent hyperthyroidism. The results suggest that metoprolol can be used as sole preoperative treatment of patients with hyperthyroidism without serious intra- or postoperative complications. Although the data indicate that the risk of postoperative hypothyroidism is higher after preoperative treatment with metoprolol than with an antithyroid drug, a longer follow-up period than 1 year is needed to draw conclusions regarding late results.\r"

Serum creatinine levels remained relatively low during postoperative days 1-4. Mean animal survival time was prolonged. Vascular lesions and mononuclear cell infiltration were greatly diminished in biopsy specimens removed on day 4. This stable prostacyclin analogue provided a degree of protection against canine renal allograft rejection.\r"

All cancers of the esophagus were squamous cell carcinomas except for five adenocarcinomas. A lesion localized within the esophageal wall was found in 55% and lymph node metastasis in 41.3% of the patients undergoing resection. All cancers of the esophagogastric junction were adenocarcinomas. The tumor had invaded beyond the boundaries of the stomach in 76.7% of these patients, and positive nodes were found in 61% of the patients. The rate of resectability was 81.2% for esophageal cancer and 74% for cancer of the esophagogastric junction. Surgical mortality after resection was 4.9% (50/1,025). The 5-year survival after resection was 20.9% (214/1,025). Better results were found following complete resection: 24% (210/875) for all patients, 28.2% (162/575) for patients with cancer of the esophagus, and 16% (48/300) for patients with cancer of the esophagogastric junction. Late survival at 10, 15, and 20 years after resection of esophageal cancer was 20%, 12%, and 7.4%, respectively. The favorable prognostic factors after resection of esophageal cancer were tumor of the lower third of the esophagus, the absence of lymph node involvement, and the presence of a localized lesion. The 5-year survival for patients with cancer of the lower third of the esophagus was 32.7%. It was 64.2% for patients with a localized lesion with negative nodes in this subgroup.\r"

The transient increase in arterial pressure associated with positive pressure inspiration is termed reversed pulsus paradoxus (RPP). Cardiorespiratory interactions and the mechanism of these effects have been studied extensively in animals, and to a lesser extent, in humans. In this clinical investigation pulsus paradoxus and RPP were studied in 10 postoperative cardiac patients with invasive monitoring and mediastinal pressure catheters placed intraoperatively. From end-expiration to end-inspiration, RPP was accompanied by decreased transmural pressures in the right atrium, left atrium, and aorta. Left ventricular end-systolic volume measured by radionuclide studies diminished during a positive pressure inspiration, without a significant change in end-diastolic volume. These results are consistent with decreased left ventricular afterload as the major mechanism of RPP. During spontaneous breathing, inspiration was associated with converse effects, a fall in arterial pressure and an increase in transmural right atrial, left atrial, and aortic pressures from end-expiration to end-inspiration. End-systolic volume was significantly larger at end-expiration than end-inspiration, with no change in end-diastolic volume. These findings suggest that an increase in left ventricular afterload during inspiration is responsible for the observed pulsus paradoxus.\r"

After correction of serum calcium level for serum protein, 25 of the bacteremic patients (37.3%) had \"corrected\" hypocalcemia (less than 8.5 mg/dL [2.12 mmol/L]), compared with only three in the nonbacteremic group (4.5%). The incidence and magnitude of hypocalcemia in gram-positive and gram-negative infections was similar. In hypocalcemic patients, the \"corrected\" calcium level was found to be inversely correlated with day of disease and attained a nadir on day 6 to 8 of bacteremia. This nadir was significantly lower in male than in female subjects. Hypocalcemic patients had a significantly higher maximal temperature than normocalcemic ones, but hypocalcemia was unrelated to serum levels of albumin, transaminase, and creatinine.\r"

With ketanserin, the heart rate was reduced only in the supine position, whereas it was reduced in the supine and standing positions with metoprolol. Response to ketanserin could not be predicted from baseline renin, aldosterone, or cortisol levels in blood, nor were there any changes in these factors or in plasma hydroxyindole levels with therapy. Ketanserin was generally well tolerated. Cholesterol values were significantly reduced with ketanserin, and there were no adverse hematologic or biochemical changes.

The other seven patients have mild or moderate functional impairment, but most of these have not shown clinical deterioration during the observation period. The occurrence of new roentgenographic infiltrates after the time of diagnosis was observed in only one patient in this series. Serum IgE and IgG levels against Aspergillus fumigatus, when compared with those of a control pool of serum samples from asthmatic patients with immediate cutaneous reactivity to Aspergillus, were the most useful immunologic studies diagnostically. Lung biopsy specimens obtained in five patients were of relatively little diagnostic value. All patients have required long-term prednisone therapy for control of asthma. Those patients whose forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) remained less than or equal to 0.8 L after initial corticosteroid treatment demonstrated a poor prognosis. When only moderate lung damage has occurred at the time of diagnosis, a stable subsequent course may be expected even in patients with stage V disease.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of regular aerobic exercise are important to an aging society increasingly preoccupied with exercise. Traditionally, most attention has been directed to the relationship between a physically active life-style and cardiovascular mortality. In an aging society, however, active life expectancy and maintenance of independence may be as important as effects of regular exercise on longevity. Regular exercise results in increased maximum aerobic capacity due to peripheral changes in muscle (increased capacity for aerobic metabolism and improved substrate and oxygen extraction with a widened arteriovenous oxygen difference) and also due to cardiovascular changes with increased stroke volume and cardiac output in normal persons. \"Therapeutic benefits\" of conditioning probably occur at submaximal work loads common to everyday activity, when cardiac work and myocardial oxygen consumption are less for any given work load, muscles are more efficient, and relative oxygen requirements are less. Aging is associated with a linear decline in maximum aerobic capacity. The rate of decline is twofold greater when comparing sedentary with physically active middle-aged men. Thus, regular exercise could conceivably lower functional aerobic age by slowing this functional decline. Exercise, particularly excessive exercise, is also associated with serious hazards, including sudden death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, excessive fatigue, hyperthermia, and significant musculoskeletal problems. Accounts of the health effects of exercise should consider a wide range of risks and benefits, especially those related to improving function, minimizing disability, and prolonging independent living.\r"

Worsening in hostile and uncooperative behaviors and a syndrome of heightened emotional tone was observed during verapamil treatment and during the postverapamil placebo period. Verapamil produced significant increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels of homovanillic acid and in plasma levels of prolactin, as well as significant decreases in plasma levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol. Verapamil and its active metabolite, norverapamil, were partitioned into CSF with CSF/plasma ratios of 0.06 and 0.04, respectively. The lack of therapeutic effects of verapamil in schizophrenic patients differs from earlier reports of its usefulness in treating manic patients. The biochemical and clinical data from our study suggest the possibility that verapamil exerts behaviorally relevant central nervous system activity in schizophrenic patients.\r"

The results indicate that the proportion of small (unstimulated or nontransformed) lymphocytes in DWDLL varies from 50% to 86%. The mean nuclear area of small lymphocytes in DWDLL is either within the size range or somewhat smaller, and many examples are more irregular in shape, than the small lymphocytes in germinal centers that are morphologically comparable with the majority of lymphocytes in DWDLL and mantle zones. The morphologic relationship of DWDLL to other NHLs, Hodgkin's disease, and paracortical, mantle, and germinal center lymphocytes in lymphoid-reactive hyperplasia was established by morphometric analysis of the nuclear profiles of small lymphocytes. The small (nontransformed) lymphocytes in those subtypes of NHL other than DWDLL have abnormally small and more irregular nuclear profiles than those in normal small lymphocytes, or the small-lymphocyte population of Hodgkin's disease.

Two of the three patients with hepatitis A virus superinfection who had focal HBcAg expression in their liver tissue had serum HBV-DNA levels that were high during the acute phase of hepatitis A virus infection, and in one patient his serum HBV-DNA levels further increased from 10 pg/10 microL to 40 pg/10 microL during the recovery phase. Thus, measurement of serum HBV-DNA levels in patients with chronic HBV infection correlated well with their hepatic HBcAg expression, and both represent the precise status of HBV replication.\r"

Fifty-seven patients in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) with three or more clinical risk factors for Candida infection were randomized to receive ketoconazole, 200 mg via the gastrointestinal tract daily (27 patients), or placebo (30 patients). Patients with hepatic dysfunction were excluded. The study was continued for 21 days or until one week after discharge from the SICU, whichever was longer. Stool cultures were obtained every three days and other cultures as indicated clinically. Patients were observed for yeast colonization (sputum, urine, stool, or wound) and invasion (fungemia or deep tissue focus). The incidence of Candida colonization was significantly lower in the ketoconazole group than the placebo group. Invasive yeast sepsis developed in five (17%) of the placebo-treated patients and in no patient in the ketoconazole group, a significant difference. Length of stay in the SICU was significantly lower in the ketoconazole group, as were the basic SICU patient charges. Sixty percent of the patients with invasive fungal sepsis died.\r"

Endotoxin given intraperitoneally promoted bacterial translocation in a dose-dependent fashion from the gut to the mesenteric lymph node (MLN). The incidence of bacterial translocation to the MLN was similar whether the endotoxin was administered intramuscularly or intraperitoneally, although the number of bacteria colonizing the MLN was greater with intraperitoneal endotoxin. The incidence and magnitude of endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation were similar between CD-1 and C3H/HeJ (endotoxin-resistant) mice, indicating that bacterial translocation is not prevented by genetic resistance to endotoxin. Thus, it appears that the gut may serve as a reservoir for bacteria causing systemic infections during endotoxemia.\r"

In the present study we investigated the functional status of various neutrophil populations using a chronic, endotoxemia-induced ARDS model. Rats infused with Escherichia coli endotoxin for three days develop an acute lung injury with a histologic picture closely resembling human ARDS. The PMNs recovered from the circulation and by bronchoalveolar lavage were compared with normal rat PMNs. In endotoxemic animals, superoxide production was markedly enhanced in circulating PMNs, indicating production of high levels of potentially cytotoxic oxygen intermediates, while myeloperoxidase activity was decreased in both circulating and lavage PMNs, indicating depressed myeloperoxidase-dependent antimicrobial activity.\r"

We studied three groups: untreated, fed rats; sham-operated rats; and septic rats. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake was increased by insulin in all three groups. Protein synthesis was maximally stimulated by 30% to 40% by 1 X 10(2) mU/L (7 X 10(2) pmol/L) of insulin in all three groups. Protein degradation in soleus muscle was not affected by insulin. In EDL muscles from untreated and sham-operated rats, protein breakdown was reduced by 15% to 20% by 1 X 10(2) mU/L (7 X 10(2) pmol/L) of insulin. In contrast, protein breakdown was not inhibited by insulin in septic EDL muscle until the concentration of the hormone was increased to 1 X 10(4) mU/L (7 X 10(4) pmol/L), at which concentration the hormonal effect was less than half that in nonseptic muscle. The results suggest a postreceptor insulin resistance of protein breakdown in septic muscle, while the response to the hormone of amino acid transport and protein synthesis was not altered in sepsis.\r"

The incidence of brain tumors that become symptomatic during pregnancy appears to be decreased compared with that in age-matched women. The relative frequency of the different primary brain tumor types is not changed by pregnancy. The number of meningiomas gradually tends to increase during pregnancy, with gliomas and spinal vascular tumors accumulating in the first and third trimesters, respectively. Postpartum amelioration of symptoms has especially been described for meningiomas and spinal vascular tumors. We conclude that different types of tumors are influenced at different stages of pregnancy. Although progesterone receptors predominate compared with estrogen receptors, no definite causal relationship with progesterone has been established.\r"

Although he was substantially correct, Ferrier's location of auditory cortex was not accepted by his contemporaries, and his observations of cortical deafness were, until recently, discounted by modern researchers. Just why his findings were rejected is of interest to the study of cortical function.\r"

The sublining region of RA synovium was classified into lymphocyte-rich areas, transitional areas, and interstitial areas, according to their pattern of cellular infiltration. In lymphocyte-rich areas, the BM of the PCV and capillaries were minimally thickened; disruption of the lamina densa was seldom seen. Transitional areas, which contained macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, had numerous PCV and capillaries. The BM was markedly thickened and partially multilamellated, and there were many disruptions in the lamina densa. The BM contained degenerated endothelial cells and cell debris. On immunostaining of this BM with monoclonal antibody C(IV)22, type IV collagen stained heavily, mainly in the disrupted lamina densa; this indicates that the thickening was, at least in part, the result of an increase in BM collagen. In uninfiltrated interstitial areas, BM were moderately thickened and multilamellated, and showed few disruptions of the lamina densa; there were similar increases in type IV collagen, but cell debris was seldom observed. Measurement of the BM width, the ratio of BM width to vessel diameter, and the fraction of vascular cross-sectional area occupied by BM demonstrated that the thickness of the BM of both PCV and capillaries was greatest in transitional areas and was smallest in lymphocyte-rich areas (P less than 0.01). Since macrophages and macrophage-derived factors have been found to promote synthesis of BM collagen type IV, and since transitional and interstitial areas are rich in macrophages and histiocytes, respectively, it is suggested that these mononuclear cells and the factors secreted by them play a significant role in the thickening of the BM of PCV and capillaries in RA synovitis.\r"

  ".W": "Although the psychiatric manifestations of heavy ethanol consumption have been well known for decades, studies on the structural changes at the level of the nerve cell which result from chronic ethanol administration are relatively recent. It is now well established that ethanol increases the fluidity of the neuronal membrane by changing the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fats in favour of the latter; in addition, the concentration of cholesterol is increased. These changes in lipid composition appear to be associated with the development of behavioural tolerance to the drug. The resultant change in membrane structure affects transport processes across the cell surface involving calcium and other electrolytes and the active transport of neurotransmitters such as the biogenic amines and GABA; there is evidence that neurotransmitter receptor function is also impaired as a consequence of the alteration in the membrane micro-environment brought about by chronic ethanol exposure. Such effects suggest that alterations in cellular function, and ultimately behaviour, are primarily the result of the changes in nerve membrane structure and function. The possible consequences of this with regard to the development of a therapy to counteract the neurotoxicity of ethanol are discussed.\r"

The factors that affect the decision to undergo vaccination include the risk of acquiring an HBV infection in emergency practice, the prevaccination immune status of emergency physicians who have knowledge of their hepatitis serum marker profile, and the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Emergency physicians have a significant risk of acquiring an HBV infection and are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control to receive vaccination. However, emergency physicians are often incidentally tested for HBV serum markers before immunization. Recent investigations have shown that seropositivity for hepatitis surface antibody (anti-HBs) does not necessarily preclude the need for immunization. Finally, experience with 750,000 doses has shown that it is a highly effective and extremely safe vaccine.\r"
