  ".W": "Drug dosages used during pediatric emergencies and resuscitation are often based on estimated body weight. The Broselow Tape, a tape measure that estimates weight and drug dosages for pediatric patients from their length, has been developed to facilitate proper dosing during emergencies. In our study, 937 children of known weight were measured with this tape. Weight estimates generated by the tape were found to be within 15% error for 79% of the children. The tape was found to be extremely accurate for children from 3.5 to 10 kg, and from 10 to 25 kg. Regression lines of estimated compared with actual weight for these children have slopes of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively, not significantly different from the ideal slope of 1.00 (P = 28 and .13). Accuracy was significantly decreased for measured children who weighed more than 25 kg. In a separate group of children (n = 53), the tape was shown to be more accurate than weight estimates made by residents and pediatric nurses (P less than .0001). Use of the Broselow Tape is a simple, accurate method of estimating pediatric weights and drug doses and eliminates the need for memorization and calculation.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the outcome of 472 trauma patients who required ambulance attention and who received prehospital advanced life support (ALS) with another similar 589 patients who received only basic life support (BLS). Nontrapped, critically injured ALS patients were treated for an average of 13 minutes at the scene of injury, compared with 17 minutes for BLS cases (P less than .05). Seventeen of 37 ALS deaths (36%) occurred within 24 hours of injury, compared with 24 of 33 BLS fatalities (73%) (P less than .05). However, the overall case fatality rate was similar in the two groups, and regression analyses did not demonstrate an impact of ALS care on mortality. ALS resuscitation did not reduce the duration of hospital or intensive care unit stay, or the incidence of disability after head injury. However, the incidence of respiratory failure in the critically injured patients was 5% (ALS) and 19% (BLS) (P less than .025). ALS care appeared to influence patient outcome during the first 24 hours after injury, but had little impact on the later clinical course. Our sample size was too small to rule out any effect of ALS on in-hospital mortality. However, the improved 24-hour survival associated with ALS care suggests some benefit of prehospital resuscitation in major trauma.\r"

Medical records were obtained for 240 cases (85.4%). Initial cardiac rhythms in the ED included ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (29%), electromechanical dissociation (18%), and asystole (51%). Thirty-two patients (13.3%) were successfully resuscitated in the ED, but only four (1.7%) survived to hospital discharge. Two patients had good neurologic outcomes; both degenerated to cardiac arrest shortly prior to arrival in the ED. The remaining two survivors were discharged to nursing homes with severe neurologic deficits. Of the 41 cases for whom no medical records could be found, 39 were noted in our logbook to have died in the ED. No record of subsequent hospital admission could be found for the other two. Both are presumed to have died. Failure to respond to prehospital ACLS predicts nonsurvival and may warrant cessation of efforts in the field. Future programs and research efforts in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest should be focused on optimal provision of prehospital care prior to the onset of irreversible deterioration.\r"

In our study, rats were given a lethal oral dose of ground granular KCN (35 or 40 mg/kg) in a gelatin capsule followed immediately by either 4 g/kg of superactivated charcoal in a 20% suspension or a similar volume of deionized water. Signs of cyanide toxicosis occurred rapidly, with a mean time to signs of 3.3 and 2.7 minutes in control animals receiving 35 or 40 mg/kg KCN, respectively. All 26 of the control rats showed signs, and all but one in the 35 mg/kg group died within 19 minutes. Only 12 of 26 rats treated with superactivated charcoal showed signs of KCN toxicosis and eight of those animals died. Oral exposure of rats to lethal doses of KCN can be treated effectively by immediate administration of superactivated charcoal.\r"

We compared the accuracy of arterial blood pressure measurements taken aboard helicopters by palpation with a Doppler device and with an oscillometric device. Twenty critically ill patients who required an intra-arterial line had simultaneous blood pressures taken invasively and with one or more of the nonivasive techniques. A total of 222 comparisons was made. Error measurements are reported as mean +/- standard deviation; a high standard deviation implies inaccuracy in individual noninvasive measurements. Mean palpation error was 19 +/- 22 torr, mean Doppler error was 8 +/- 17 torr, mean oscillometric systolic error was 0 +/- 33 torr, and mean oscillometric mean blood pressure measurement error was 10 +/- 15 torr. A blood pressure undetectable by noninvasive means was no guarantee of a low arterial pressure: four patients with arterial systolic pressures from 45 to 138 torr had nonpalpable pulses; three patients had systolic pressures between 98 and 143 torr that were not detectable with the Doppler device; and two patients had systolic pressures of 70 and 110 torr that were undetectable by the oscillometric device. We conclude that aboard helicopters some ill patients cannot have accurate noninvasive measurement of their arterial blood pressure made with present technology. Relying on inaccurate blood pressure measurements may lead to therapeutic mishaps.\r"

Eleven persons (27%) were intoxicated (average blood alcohol of 279 mg/dL; range, 140 to 460). Of the 30 survivors transported, hospital records were available for 24. Thirteen were hospitalized and ten underwent surgery. Six major amputations occurred among survivors. Six patients had an Injury Severity Score of more than 15. Three mechanisms of injury occurred: falls on or from a train (56%); pedestrians hit by a train (41%), which accounted for all fatalities; and a train-automobile accident. This is the first comprehensive review of all significant railroad-related injuries in a metropolitan area.\r"

Twenty animals underwent bilateral common iliac to common femoral artery bypass with proximal ligation of the femoral artery. In each animal one groin was randomly assigned to receive stented PTFE and the other nonstented PTFE. One animal was sacrificed at 2 weeks for graft infection. Nineteen animals received 38 grafts that remained in place 90-120 days. Patency was confirmed with angiography prior to sacrifice. Overall patency was 65 per cent with no significant difference between the two types of graft. Eighteen of 19 dogs (95%) had both the stented and nonstented PTFE grafts either open or closed. It is concluded that intrinsic factors, rather than external graft support, are a more important influence on graft patency in this model.\r"

This study demonstrates the mechanism of persistent withdrawal occlusion and describes a method for resolving this complication. Of 42 cancer patients with totally implantable central venous access ports, 8 (19%) patients developed 11 episodes of PWO. Venograms demonstrated a sheath around the catheter beginning at the catheter entrance to the central vein and extending 1-5 cm beyond the catheter tip. Each episode of PWO was treated with 250,000 units of urokinase dissolved in 150cc D5/W infused through the port over 90 minutes. Venograms were obtained immediately after each urokinase infusion. Follow-up ranged from 13-130 days. After urokinase infusion the venogram showed no change in the sheath in 1 episode of PWO and complete dissolution of the sheath in 10 episodes of PWO. PWO recurred once in one patient and twice in another patient. PWO resolved only in the 10 episodes in which sheath dissolution was demonstrated. Urokinase infusion, as described, is effective in resolving persistent withdrawal occlusion. The method is repeatable and safe. That resolution of PWO by urokinase infusion was accompanied by dissolution of the sheath suggests that the sheath is composed primarily of fibrin and that flap action of the sheath is the mechanism causing PWO.\r"

Operative management ranged from decompressive cecostomy to total proctocolectomy. The best results were obtained with subtotal colectomy and ileostomy. It is concluded that PMC should be managed surgically in a manner analogous to ulcerative colitis. If there is no improvement after 7 days of aggressive medical management, surgical intervention, ileostomy with subtotal colectomy is indicated to prevent complications. Complications of PMC, toxic megacolon and perforation, should also be managed with ileostomy and subtotal colectomy as simple decompression or segmental resection does nothing to alter the underlying disease process.\r"

In recent years, however, nonoperative therapy has emerged as an alternative to operation. Twenty five years of experience with SCCA at this institution were reviewed to examine the presentation and outcome of a population treated primarily with surgery. Forty two patients, including 26 women and 16 men, had a mean age of 56 years. SCCA was usually heralded by a mass, bleeding, or pain and was associated with chronic perianal disease in 25.8%. Symptoms were present for an average of 11 months. Among the patients in this review, 92.3 per cent underwent radical surgery, while 11.9 per cent had radiation as their primary therapy following palliative surgery or local excisions for biopsy. Actuarial 5-year-survival for the entire group was 45.5 percent; all patients with nodal or disseminated disease at diagnosis have died. Patients with perianal lesions fared no better than those with anal tumors, probably due to the unusually large perianal tumors in this series. To diagnose SCCA at its earliest stage, a high index of suspicion must be maintained when dealing with anal and perianal lesions, especially if the abnormality is chronic. When compared with reported advances in combined therapy, it is likely that in most cases surgery alone no longer offers optimal treatment for SCCA.\r"

The patients ranged from 18 to 94 years of age and 60 per cent were women. Forty seven per cent of patients were seen within 6 weeks postoperatively and 79 per cent within 3 months of surgery. Sixty four per cent of patients had a single stone; the remainder had multiple stones, sludge or ductal debris. Sinus tract manipulation under fluoroscopic control was done using a variety of baskets, catheters and instruments, including endoscopy, along with pre- and post-manipulation intravenous antibiotics. Routine testing and cultures are done and useful when clinical biliary sepsis occurs (1%). Meticulous postextraction cholangiography has contributed to our success and is an important part of the procedure, usually done 24 hours after the last manipulation. Successful extraction occurred during a single session in 125 of 219 patients (57%); 60 of 219 patients required two extraction sessions. Four patients spontaneously passed stones. The remaining patients required three to seven sessions before the extraction was considered complete. Successful extraction of all stones and debris from patients' biliary ducts occurred in 210 of 219 cases (96%). Five of the nine failures occurred in the first one hundred patients (1974-1979) and all required reoperation. Failure occurred in four of the last one hundred patients (1979-1986) and all were successfully treated by ERCP extraction. Two deaths occurred very early in our series and were related to advanced biliary sepsis at the time of the initial presentation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Endoscopic papillotomy in 237 patients had a 1.3 per cent mortality. Successful extraction of the stone occurred in 91.6 per cent of 108 patients followed for at least 2 years with no further treatment required. Morbidity and mortality was uneffected by previous biliary surgery, repeat attempts at stone extraction or EP performed prior to cholecystectomy (P greater than 0.1). The results of treatment for choledocholithiasis in 111 consecutive patients was then retrospectively reviewed to assess the impact of endoscopic papillotomy. CBDE was used initially in 79 and EP in 32 patients. Previous cholecystectomy and age biased the selection for endoscopic papillotomy (P less than 0.01). The mean ages were 57.8 years and 70.6 years (P less than 0.01), for CBDE and EP pts respectively. Age adjusted hospital stay was significantly longer for common bile duct exploration (P = 0.002). Overall, morbidity was not different between the treatment modalities (P = 0.50) and each group had one death (P = 0.23). In this community hospital, endoscopic papillotomy is safe, effective, and was reserved mainly for older patients or those with prior cholecystectomy and choledocholithiasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Full thickness infiltration of the abdominal wall by intraabdominal cancer, especially after effective prior therapy, is frequently considered a sign of inoperability. Such patients are treated with irradiation, chemotherapy, or locally destructive means (laser, cryosurgery) with limited success. Full thickness resection of portions of the abdominal wall has not been widely used in such settings because of concerns regarding abdominal wall reconstruction and also because of the perceived noncurative nature of such \"radical\" procedures. While long-term prognosis in patients with abdominal wall infiltration by cancer depends upon various factors, technical considerations regarding reconstruction need not prevent effective local palliative therapy. Bridging large defects can be successfully accomplished by using available synthetic material of a durable, inert nature. Polyprophylene (Marlex) mesh, a readily available and inexpensive inert fabric, meets all desirable features for such use. This paper details the successful treatment of three patients in whom recurrent carcinoma infiltrated the full thickness of the abdominal wall and caused intractable pain. In all three, full thickness portions of the abdominal wall were resected, segments of intestine and of urinary bladder were also excised, and the defects were closed using a double layer of polypropylene mesh. Complete relief of pain was accomplished and the cosmetic and functional results were excellent. Illustration A depicts procedure in patients one and two. Illustration B depicts procedure in patient three.\r"

Colorectal liver metastases constituted the largest group (n = 18), followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 2), Echinococcal liver cyst (n = 1), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1), and leiomyosarcoma (n = 1). The mean age was 41.8 +/- 14.6 years (range: 23-69 years). Fifteen women and nine men comprised the group. The operative morbidity was 21 per cent, the 30-day operative mortality was 8 per cent (two deaths). Both operative deaths occurred in patients with colorectal liver metastases. The 18 patients with colorectal liver metastases included ten women and eight men. The mean age was 59.1 +/- 6.5 years (range: 46-69 years). There were seven synchronous and 11 metachronous liver metastases. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was found elevated in 14 of the original primary colonic carcinomas, and in all but one patient with metachronous liver metastases. The mean time from colorectal carcinoma resection to occurrence of metachronous metastases was 17.1 +/- 5.8 months. To date, 10 patients have had recurrences of liver metastases after hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases. The mean time of recurrence was 12.6 +/- 11.9 months. The size of the metastases was 3.8 +/- 3.2 cm (range: 0.2-17 cm). The mean number of lesions present was 1.5 +/- 1.0. The 1 year and 2 year actuarial survival rates were 87.5 and 43.8 per cent respectively. The longest survivor is alive 54 months after his hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases and remains to this date disease free.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of 149 consecutive potentially curable rectal adenocarcinomas operated on at our institution between 1965 and 1981 was carried out to assess whether tumor morphology influences long term survival. Complete follow-up was available on all patients and extended to 20 years. Data on tumor morphology was extracted from pathology reports and was available in 147 cases (98.6%). Tumors were defined as exophytic (n = 76) when exhibiting a polypoid growth pattern protruding into the lumen at least 1 cm; when lacking such characteristic growth pattern, tumors were classified under the general term of nonexophytic (n = 71). The 5 year survival rate calculated with life table analysis was 80 per cent for exophytic carcinomas and 54.1 per cent for nonexophytic tumors. This difference was verified by logistic regression analysis and proportional hazard technique and is statistically highly significant (P = 0.001). The rate of distant metastases was 29.7 per cent for exophytic adenocarcinoma and 48.6 per cent for nonexophytic tumors (P = 0.02). Although the results did not reach statistical significance, local recurrence of tumor occurred about twice as often in nonexophytic tumors (15.7%) compared with exophytic tumors (8.1%). Thus, we conclude that tumor morphology is an important preoperative prognostic factor for survival and prediction of distant metastasis, and possibly for local recurrence.\r"

There were 76 cases performed for diverticulitis. This procedure is easy to perform and carries a low risk. While it removes the diseased bowel segment, it leaves the patient with a colostomy requiring a major operation for closure. When possible, resection with anastomosis is preferable. There are no generally accepted guidelines for performing the Hartmann procedure; it depends on the individual surgeon. Forty three cases were performed for carcinoma. For palliation, it is a good operation; for cure others are preferable. With few exceptions, it is a poor choice for inflammatory bowel disease. In 42 cases of diverticulitis, the colostomy was not closed because of the patient's age, medical or surgical contraindications. Thirteen patients declined the closure. Twelve pouches had to be removed. Mild colitis was found in every pouch examined endoscopically. Severe colitis was found in one patient operated for cancer, in three for diverticulitis, and in 11 for colitis.\r"

The authors have applied this device to the control of anal continence in dogs. Fifteen mongrel dogs underwent either anal sphincter disruption (7) or abdominal-perineal resection (8). Such animals have bowel movements almost hourly. In each case, the device was implanted at the time of surgery. In dogs with working cuffs and disabled or absent sphincters, continence was maintained in seven out of 15 animals for periods of 4-8 hours. After cuff activation, intraluminal cuff pressures of 50-70 cm of water achieved continence for a period of 8 hours. In animals sacrificed from 1 to 12 months after implantation, the device was found to be well tolerated by the body with minimal fibrosis of the mucosa or muscularis of the bowel. Complications observed in the same four out of 15 animals during the study period were infection, device extrusion, and device malfunction. Infection resolved with local wound care and antibiotics (3/4) and the device was successfully replaced in two out of four instances of extrusion. With cuffs of proper size and pressure, this appliance may be effective in the control of human anal incontinence via the establishment of continent perineal colostomies following an abdominal-perineal resection.\r"

DESIGN: Cohort study with weight and other important variables measured in 1948 to 1951 (mean age of subjects, 37 years) and knee arthritis evaluated in 1983 to 1985 (mean age of subjects, 73 years). SETTING: Population-based participants; a subset (n = 1420) of the Framingham Heart Study cohort. METHODS: For those subjects in the Framingham Study having knee radiographs taken as part of the 18th biennial examination (1983 to 1985), we examined Metropolitan Relative Weight, a measure of weight adjusted for height at the onset of the study (1948 to 1951). Relative risks were computed as the cumulative incidence rate of radiographic knee osteoarthritis in the heaviest weight groups at examination 1 divided by the cumulative rate in the lightest 60% weight groups at examination 1. Relative risks were adjusted for age, physical activity level, and uric acid level. RESULTS: In 1983 to 1985, 468 subjects (33%) had radiographic knee osteoarthritis. For men, the risk of knee osteoarthritis was increased in those in the heaviest quintile of weight at examination 1 compared with those in the lightest three quintiles (age-adjusted relative risk, 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 1.98); risk was not increased for those in the second heaviest quintile (relative risk, 1.0). The association between weight and knee osteoarthritis was stronger in women than in men; for women in the most overweight quintile at examination 1, relative risk was 2.07 (95% CI, 1.67 to 2.55), and for those in the second heaviest group, relative risk was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.86). This link between obesity and subsequent osteoarthritis persisted after controlling for serum uric acid level and physical activity level, and was strongest for persons with severest radiographic disease. Obesity at examination 1 was associated with the risk of developing both symptomatic and asymptomatic osteoarthritis. CONCLUSIONS: These results and other corroborative cross-sectional data show that obesity or as yet unknown factors associated with obesity cause knee osteoarthritis.\r"

A model of hyperuricemia in the rat was evaluated for its contribution to urate levels in the aqueous humor. Epinephrine-induced hyperuricemia in male rats was shown to increase mean serum urate levels from 1.2 mg/dL to 6.7 mg/dL. Female rats were shown to have a lower uric acid baseline and a lower absolute hyperuricemic level than males. The mean aqueous-humor urate levels were increased from 0.06 mg/dL to 0.33 mg/dL for male rats. In our studies, the blood-aqueous barrier effectively prevented equilibration between the systemic and ocular compartments. The increased aqueous-humor uric acid levels in glaucoma may arise from intraocular mechanisms.\r"

Others are less conservative and recommend treatment on an ambulatory basis without the drug. In order to establish the overall rebleed rate for small hyphemas and to assess whether or not strict bed rest improves the prognosis, we studied 73 patients with small hyphemas occupying less than one third of the anterior chamber. Thirty-seven patients, during the first year of the study, were hospitalized and treated with strict bed rest while 36 patients, during the second year, were hospitalized but allowed to ambulate freely. The overall incidence of rebleeds was 15% (11 of 73). The incidence of rebleeds and other complications was not statistically different between the two study groups. Additionally, the final visual acuity in both groups was essentially identical. We conclude that bed rest does not improve the prognosis in cases of small hyphemas.\r"

It has been found that habitual sniffing causes high degrees of negative middle ear pressure in diseased ears; this finding demonstrates eustachian tube patency rather than obstruction. Ears intubated for chronic secretory otitis media, middle ear atelectasis, and cholesteatoma were examined to identify patent eustachian tubes. More than one third of the patients aspirated a solution into the middle ear with one or more sniffs by aspirating air from their middle ears, demonstrating eustachian tube patency rather than obstruction.\r"

Results from evoked electromyographic (EMG) and muscle tension studies (twitch and tetanic contraction) provided the basis of comparison. In addition, the timing of denervation was studied (ie, at the time of implantation of the NMP or NI, or 2 weeks following implantation). The NMP achieved more rapid reinnervation and produced stronger contractions than the NI. Demonstrable reinnervation with an NMP was accelerated when the implantation occurred prior to the denervation. This was not the case with the NI. There was poor correlation between the evoked EMG potential and the strength of both twitch and tetanic contraction. It was concluded on the basis of this study that muscle tension provided a more accurate means of assessing reinnervated muscle function. Of the two methods, the NMP would seem, therefore, to be the technique of choice when it is available. The NI is certainly effective and should be used when a satisfactory NMP is not available.\r"

The responses were elicited using low intensity stimuli (30-dB nHL clicks) and simultaneously were recorded on a dual time base. Both the ABR and MLR were elicited in 70 ears. In 12 ears, just one response was recorded (ABR in eight ears and the MLR in four ears). In 14 ears, neither response was recorded. Test-retest analysis on the same subject demonstrated that the ABR was more repeatable and easier to identify than the MLR. The test-retest difference was determined for the amplitude and latency of the ABR and MLR waveforms. The test-retest latency difference for wave Pa was found to be 3.6 times larger than for wave V. The normalized test-retest amplitude difference for P phi-Na, Na-Pa, and Pa-Nb was found to be two to three times larger than for wave V. These data support the conclusion that the ABR, rather than the MLR, should be used to measure hearing in young children. The authors also advocate using minimal high pass (HP) filtering when recording the ABR in a sedated or sleeping child. Muscle artifact was not found to be a problem. The authors suggest the use of minimal HP filtering so that phase-shift distortion is minimized and a larger response amplitude can be recorded.\r"

However, neither the length of the bony eustachian tube nor the vector of maximum pull of the tensor veli palatini muscle was associated statistically with the extent of pneumatization.

Particular attention was paid to the subglottic region, where previous studies have reported areas of squamous metaplasia in neonates, infants, and nonsmoking adults. Both types of epithelium were found in different proportions in the supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic regions. There was considerable downward extension of squamous epithelium from the glottis into the subglottic region, with a wide transition zone where both types of epithelium were found in close association. These observations would suggest that such areas of squamous epithelium in the nonglottic larynx are normal, rather than always indicating a response to extrinsic trauma or irritation. Therefore, the term squamous metaplasia may be inappropriate when applied to such areas in the adult larynx.\r"

As quantitative data on the incidence of SBs in the different rows of OHCs are lacking and as some of the above differences may have a circadian basis, in the present study SBs were counted in guinea pigs killed at different times of the day and night. In the second turn of the cochlea, synapses with perpendicular and parallel SBs were distinguished. Perpendicular SBs, but not parallel SBs, were significantly higher in number in the third row. Circadian changes were observed for perpendicular SBs, which were higher in number in the evening than in the morning. Circadian changes were absent in the parallel SBs of the OHCs and in the SBs of the inner hair cells. These results show that the afferent synapses of OHCs are rather complex, structurally as well as temporally; the functional significance of this finding remains to be elucidated.\r"

The vast majority of the epithelial cells were secretory, and the rest were ciliated. The mucous blanket consisted of the electron-lucent periciliary fluid and the mucous layer. In the mucous layer, two layers were identified: an inner layer with migrating cells, and an outer layer with specks. Moreover, there was a lucent zone over the nonciliated surface that was as high as the microvilli. The thickness of the periciliary layer was predominantly as great as that of the ciliary tips, which just make contact with the mucous layer; however, the mucous layer occasionally penetrated into the periciliary space. These findings indicated that there is a mucociliary dysfunction in the middle ear caused by a decrease in the number of ciliated cells, and an abnormal interaction between cilia and mucus that would interfere with ciliary movement. Thus, such a system would fail to transport the mucous blanket.\r"

The tracheal mucosa was studied for histologic changes in the cilia, the epithelium, submucosal reaction, and mucus production at the level of the carina. The results were significant (p = .02) for the interaction of the experimental type and method of treatment in their effect on the histologic changes noted at the carina. The study supports the use of an HME as an alternative for long-term humidification in a patient with a tracheotomy.\r"

For a given subject, variations in torque, measured after a constant angular deflection, were mediated largely by changes in stretch reflex threshold, rather than by changes in reflex stiffness. Between-subject comparisons were sensitive to stiffness differences between limbs, but reflex thresholds were still broadly correlated with torque magnitude, suggesting that reductions in stretch reflex threshold are uniformly present in spastic muscles. These findings, coupled with the apparent similarity of reflex stiffness estimates in voluntarily activated spastic and normal muscles, suggest that the central disturbance in spasticity is a reduction in the threshold of the stretch reflex, without a significant enhancement of reflex gain.\r"

Seventy-three sickle cell disease patients underwent neurological examinations and high-field, heavily T2-weighted axial cranial magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning. Eighteen of the 73 had a history of stroke, defined as an acute, focal neurological sign lasting longer than 1 hour; in the event of a convulsive onset, an MRI abnormality as a correlate was necessary. Sixteen of the 18 stroke patients demonstrated focal MRI abnormalities consistent with arterial borderzone infarctions. Fifty-five of the 73 patients had no history of stroke. Six of the 55 (11%) had focal MRI abnormalities suggesting previous subclinical stroke. Five of these lesions were in borderzone regions. The distinguishing feature in 21 of the 22 patients with MRI abnormalities was the predilection for lesions in the high cortical convexity, in the general regions of arterial borderzones between the major cerebral arteries and adjacent deep white matter. The pattern of MRI lesions suggests two pathogenetic mechanisms: (1) proximal large-vessel disease with inadequate cerebral perfusion (distal field insufficiency syndrome) and (2) distal small-vessel disease (sludging syndrome).\r"

  ".W": "By means of a computerized system of spike detection, presentation of visual stimuli, and registration of reaction times (RTs), we have shown previously that focal posterior interictal spikes cause transiently prolonged RT and increased nonperception and misperception of stimuli, especially contralateral to the spike. We report here the temporal profile of this phenomenon, ascertained by systematically increasing a delay between spike and stimulus-flash, until the latter was well beyond the limits of the entire spike-wave complex. In each of two subjects, the spike effect began just before the spike and ended with the termination of the after-coming slow wave. For stimuli with identical delays following spikes, RTs were significantly prolonged if the end of the slow wave overlapped the stimulus, and not otherwise. In one subject, who had an amplitude dissociation between spikes and after-coming slow waves, the prolongation of RT was associated with the larger waves, regardless of spike amplitude. These findings suggest that the after-coming slow wave (surround hyperpolarization) transiently disrupts aspects of cortical functioning, in addition to whatever effect the spike itself may have. Focal spike-wave-induced cortical dysfunction may be relevant to a variety of interictal cognitive disorders.\r"

Seventy-eight percent were demented using conservative criteria; 55% had characteristic Alzheimer's disease. Choline acetyltransferase and somatostatin were significantly reduced in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease as compared with age-matched nursing home control subjects, although the degree of the reduction was less severe than found in subjects less than 80 years of age. Ten subjects whose functional and cognitive performance was in the upper quintile of the nursing home residents, as good as or better than the performance of the upper quintile of residents without brain pathology (control subjects), showed the pathological features of mild Alzheimer's disease, with many neocortical plaques. Plaque counts were 80% of those of demented patients with Alzheimer's disease. Choline acetyltransferase and somatostatin levels were intermediate between controls and demented patients with Alzheimer's disease. The unexpected findings in these subjects were higher brain weights and greater number of neurons (greater than 90 micron 2 in a cross-sectional area in cerebral cortex) as compared to age-matched nursing home control subjects. These people may have had incipient Alzheimer's disease but escaped loss of large neurons, or alternatively, started with larger brains and more large neurons and thus might be said to have had a greater reserve.\r"

Limbic evoked potential recordings appear to be useful in the determination of a focal functional deficit and thus in identifying the site of epileptogenic pathology. Further, the results support the hypothesis of a local generator for limbic evoked potentials and demonstrate that limbic evoked potentials in humans include not only low-frequency, high-amplitude electric field changes, but also a high-frequency component.\r"

In normal subjects, there was an age-related increase in CSF protein and AChE activity and a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between CSF protein and BChE activity. In the DAT and EDAT groups, CSF AChE activities (mean +/- SD = 17.5 +/- 3.6 and 15.3 +/- 4.4 nmol/min/ml, respectively) were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than in 13 age-matched control subjects (21.5 +/- 5.6 nmol/min/ml). In contrast, neither CSF protein concentration, BChE activity, nor the ratio of AChE/BChE differed significantly between groups. In patients with DAT, CSF AChE activity was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in subjects with an early onset compared to those with a late onset (16.4 +/- 3.4 and 19.7 +/- 2.8 nmol/min/ml, respectively), and activity in the latter group did not differ significantly from control values. CSF AChE activity was not related to dementia severity and did not change significantly over an 18-month period. Although these results confirm a cholinergic deficit in patients with DAT, the considerable overlap of CSF AChE activity between groups and the nonsignificant correlation between AChE activity and dementia severity limit the usefulness of CSF AChE as a diagnostic marker of this disorder.\r"

The first monoclonal antibody, RMO87, stained only intraneuronal NFTs and is specific for phosphate-dependent epitopes in tau and the two high molecular weight neurofilament proteins. The second monoclonal antibody, 2.2B10, is specific for glial fibrillary acidic protein, and it stained only the RMO87-negative extracellular NFTs. Treatment of sections with alkaline phosphatase or sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the isolation of NFTs from hippocampus, did not expose RMO87 binding sites in extracellular NFTs. These observations indicate that neurofilament-like and tau-like epitopes can be lost from NFTs in situ, and that at least two populations of morphologically and immunochemically distinct NFTs exist.\r"

We studied the effects of tobacco smoking on smooth pursuit eye movements and found defects in both vertical and horizontal tracking during the first 5 minutes after smoking one cigarette. The smooth pursuit defect consisted of a reduction in upward tracking velocity and the superposition of saccadic square-wave jerks on both vertical and horizontal tracking eye movements. The degree of impairment in upward smooth pursuit correlated with the intensity of tobacco-induced nystagmus present when recording in darkness. We suggest that these alterations are due to summation of nystagmus on normal tracking eye movements rather than primary defects in the smooth pursuit system.\r"

Cross-correlation histograms generated from the two spike trains of each motor unit pair demonstrated central or paracentral peaks in 13/19 recordings during PT, 22/36 during EPT, and 6/7 during VT. Relative peak area was used as a quantitative index of synchronization between the two motor units of each pair. It was lowest in PT, progressively increased in EPT as tremor amplitude increased, and highest in VT. In PT and lower amplitude EPT, the synchronization indexes were higher between motor units that discharged at the same or nearly the same frequency. In contrast, in higher amplitude EPT and VT, motor units with different firing frequencies were sometimes strongly synchronized as a consequence of double discharges in faster-firing motor units that had burst repetition rates in the range of slower-firing motor units discharging as singlets. Greater motor unit synchronization with increasing tremor amplitude in EPT may be secondary to a simultaneous increase in muscle spindle afferent activity from the tremulous muscle. Greatest synchronization in VT presumably reflects near maximal supraspinal and segmental common synaptic input onto motoneurons that generate VT. These results support a longstanding hypothesis that synchronization of motor units is the physiological basis for higher amplitude tremor.\r"

The common carotid artery was irradiated for 6.5 minutes with the focused beam of an argon laser operated at a wavelength of 514.5 nm with a peak power of 2 W and an average power of 400 mw. Ipsilateral cerebral infarcts, ranging in size from 0.1 to 1.7 mm, were produced by platelet emboli in 12 of 13 rats. A total of 44 infarcts were observed in the 12 rats: 29 in the cortex, 6 in the hippocampus, 5 in the thalamus, and 4 in the basal ganglia. Scanning electron microscopy identified platelet aggregates in the carotid artery and in a deep cortical arteriole 50 minutes after the photochemical lesion. Twenty-four hours after the experiment, scanning electron microscopy of the carotid artery revealed damaged endothelium but few remaining adherent platelets. More intense laser irradiation in 8 rats, leading to carotid occlusion, produced an infarct in only 1. This new model can be used to study the acute and chronic pathological changes in the brain associated with platelet embolism.\r"

Characteristic features are onset in early childhood, very slow progression, normal life expectancy, weakness of proximal limb muscles, especially in the legs, elevation of serum creatine kinase, and no cardiac or intellectual involvement. In biopsy material muscle fibers are almost never necrotic but show excessive autophagic activity and exocytosis of the phagocytosed material. We suggest that this family has an undescribed type of congenital myopathy, for which we propose the name X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy.\r"

  ".W": "We studied horizontal visual tracking in 20 patients with unilateral cerebral lesions and in 10 age-matched control subjects. Five patients, all with posterior lesions, showed impaired smooth pursuit of predictable targets moving toward the side of the cerebral lesion. Using nonpredictable step-ramp stimuli, we identified two distinct deficits of visual tracking. The first was a unidirectional deficit of smooth pursuit, for targets moving toward the side of the lesion, in response to stimuli presented into either visual hemifield. The second deficit, identified in a sixth patient who did not show pursuit asymmetry to predictable targets, was a bidirectional inability to estimate the speed of a moving target in the visual hemifield contralateral to the side of the lesion; this caused inaccurate saccades to moving (but not stationary) targets and impaired smooth pursuit initiation. These visual tracking deficits were independent of homonymous hemianopia or hemispatial neglect. These two tracking deficits are similar to those described in rhesus monkeys with lesions of the medial superior temporal and middle temporal visual areas.\r"

  ".W": "To measure myelin basic protein (MBP)-like material in cerebrospinal fluid, we compared two radioimmunoassays, both using the same antiserum to MBP but one using peptide (45-89) as the radioligand and standard (peptide assay), and the other using purified MBP as the radioligand and standard (MBP assay), with respect to their diagnostic sensitivity. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens from 185 patients with definite multiple sclerosis (MS) (n = 27), possible MS (n = 63), probable MS (n = 24), and other neurological disease (n = 71) were analyzed using both assays. The diagnostic sensitivity of the peptide assay was significantly better than that of the MBP assay in those with definite MS (sensitivity 59% and 30%, respectively); there was no significant difference in specificity. The peptide assay also showed better correlation with disease activity than the MBP assay: 14 patients classified as having active MS showed significantly higher sensitivity (78.6% versus 38%, p less than 0.04) when compared to patients with inactive disease. The MBP assay showed no significant difference between these two groups. Besides the increase in sensitivity, the actual molar concentrations of immunoreactive MBP detected using this peptide assay were considerably higher than those found using the MBP assay. These results show that the use of MBP antisera capable of recognizing epitopes present in the carboxyl half of MBP peptide (45-89) results in more sensitive detection of immunoreactive MBP when used with MBP peptide (45-89) as radiolabeled ligand in the assay.\r"

  ".U": "88239499\r", 
  ".W": "Recently, a theoretical scheme offered mechanisms by which phenytoin exerts its antiepileptic effects. Two predictions arising from this proposal are that phenytoin would suppress alterations in the potency of excitatory neurotransmission engendered by repetitive neural activation and that this effect would be augmented by displacing the extracellular concentration of K+ ([K+]0) away from its normal resting level. In the present study, we tested these predictions by examining the effects of phenytoin on short- and long-term functional plasticity in vitro in the hippocampus. Extracellular field potentials were recorded in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice in response to stimulation of the Schaeffer collaterals. Phenytoin (20 micrograms/ml) did not affect baseline excitatory neurotransmission as measured by input-output curves (population spike amplitude versus stimulus intensity) obtained at low stimulus rates. The drug also had no effect on either frequency potentiation (2.5 Hz) or long-term potentiation (50 Hz, 500 msec; or 400 Hz, 20 msec). When [K+]0 was raised to levels seen during seizures, the drug still did not alter frequency potentiation or long-term potentiation induced by either type of stimulus train. Phenytoin also had no effect on either stimulus-locked or spontaneous epileptiform bursts that appear in conjunction with elevated [K+]0 or on stimulus-locked bursts that appear in the presence of 0.75 mM extracellular calcium. These results, showing that certain forms of functional synaptic plasticity are not affected by phenytoin, suggest a means by which phenytoin could exert its antiepileptic action without interfering with normal brain function.\r"

Strains designated SF27 and SF28 showed low-level resistance to lincosamides: one was susceptible to erythromycin (SF27) and the other was resistant (SF28). Analysis of ribosomes from the resistant strains in an in vitro poly(U)-dependent protein-synthesizing system showed that ribosomes of both strains were sensitive to lincomycin and clindamycin. Four patterns of high-level resistance to lincosamides were observed (strains SF4, SF19, SF30, and SF31). All of these except SF30 had ribosomes which were highly resistant in vitro to the antibiotics and showed a close correlation with results of the in vivo experiments. In vivo protein synthesis by strain SF30 was resistant to lincomycin and sensitive to clindamycin, whereas the ribosomes were sensitive when assayed in vitro. Lincosamide-inactivating enzymes were not detected in cell extracts of the six resistant strains. Strains SF19 and SF31 demonstrated two ribosome-mediated lincosamides resistance mechanisms that were not previously reported. Both strains were highly resistant to lincosamides and susceptible to erythromycin, but SF19 was also highly resistant to oleandomycin and partially resistant to various macrolides.\r"

No consistent synergistic killing could be demonstrated by the combination of glycopeptide and aminoglycoside antibiotics at arbitrarily chosen concentrations within the range of clinically achievable levels. However, by careful adjustment of both vancomycin and gentamicin concentrations within a narrow range below the MIC of each antibiotic, synergistic killing could be seen with an aminoglycoside-susceptible strain but not with an aminoglycoside-resistant strain. Synergism between glycopeptide and aminoglycoside antibiotics occurs with some diphtheroid organisms, but it may not be clinically relevant.\r"

Both vancomycin and LY146032 killed S. aureus, but the time-killing curves differed: the effect of vancomycin was slow, limited, and not related to the concentration of the drug, whereas that of LY146032 was rapid, extensive, and related to concentration. When strains ATCC 25923 and CIP 6525 were exposed to LY146032, the population decreased exponentially with time. The killing rate was constant and linked to the concentration by a Michaelis-Menten relationship. The maximum killing rate and the affinity constant of LY146032, estimated from the data transformed by the Lineweaver-Burk method, differed for the two strains. The concentration of the antibiotic at which killing theoretically begins (estimated by linear regression using the logarithm of the concentration) is of the same magnitude as the MIC of LY146032, which indicates the pure bactericidal mode of action of the drug. S. aureus ATCC 12600 was more resistant to the bactericidal effect of the two drugs, and its killing curve did not conform to the model described here.\r"

Urinary colonization with group D streptococci occurred in 7 of 27 (26%) carumonam-treated patients compared with 7 of 19 (37%) gentamicin-treated patients; no one required treatment. A significant correlation was found between colonization with group D streptococci and neurogenic bladder dysfunction (P less than 0.007). It is concluded that the use of the carumonam is as effective as the gentamicin regimen in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections.\r"

Trough and peak concentrations in serum were measured on two successive days to verify the attainment of steady state; and 1 trough and 12 postdose values of the concentration in serum were collected on the following day. Cefonicid concentrations in serum were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The cefonicid serum concentration versus time profile after intravenous infusion was clearly biexponential in all patients. The terminal elimination half-life determined by nonlinear regression analysis was 4.63 +/- 1.49 h (mean +/- standard deviation). The steady-state volume of distribution and total body clearance were 0.12 +/- 0.04 liter/kg and 0.369 +/- 0.110 ml/min per kg, respectively. These results are comparable to parameters derived from previous studies in noninfected normal volunteers. Thus, the disposition of cefonicid is not altered in patients with severe skin and skin structure infections.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of phosphorylated ribavirin on a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in vitro transcription reaction was examined. Viral mRNA synthesized in the presence of the 5' mono-, di-, and triphosphorylated forms of the drug translated with equal efficiencies under the test conditions. However, all three phosphorylated species inhibited VSV transcription. The mono- and diphosphorylated forms of the drug possessed approximately two to three times the inhibitory activity as the triphosphorylated form. Transcripts synthesized in the presence of drug were full length and were absent of incorporated drug. Inhibition by ribavirin 5'-diphosphate could be reversed by the addition of UTP, CTP, and GTP, while the addition of GDP to the reaction did not reverse inhibition. Ribavirin diphosphate was added to a La Crosse virus in vitro transcription assay to determine whether an inhibitory effect could be established in a viral system that was more sensitive to ribavirin than was VSV; it led to profound inhibition of RNA synthesis at concentrations as low as 0.1 microgram/ml. These data suggest that ribavirin has an effect on the initial steps of transcription by some RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and that this effect may be mediated by several phosphorylated forms.\r"

  ".W": "The single-dose pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered cefoperazone (2.0 g) and sulbactam (1.0 g) were studied in normal subjects and in patients with various degrees of renal failure. In an open, parallel experimental design, six normal subjects (creatinine clearance, greater than 90 ml/min), two patients with mild renal failure (creatinine clearance, 31 to 60 ml/min), eight patients with moderate renal failure (creatinine clearance, 7 to 30 ml/min), and four functionally anephric patients (creatinine clearance, less than 7 ml/min) were studied. The functionally anephric patients were given two test doses to allow study of drug disposition both on and off hemodialysis. Serial blood and urine samples were collected from time zero to 12 h after dosing in normal subjects and from 0 to 72 h in renal patients. Serum concentrations of both drugs declined biexponentially. For cefoperazone, the terminal elimination half-lives averaged from 1.6 to 3.0 h and were similar in subjects and patients. No cefoperazone pharmacokinetic parameters were appreciably altered by renal failure or hemodialysis, and there was no correlation between the total body clearance of cefoperazone and estimated creatinine clearance. In contrast, the sulbactam total body clearance was highly correlated with estimated creatinine clearance (r = 0.92, P less than 0.01) and was significantly higher in normal volunteers than in the renally impaired groups (P less than 0.01). The sulbactam terminal elimination half-life in functionally anephric patients (9.7 +/- 5.3 h) differed significantly from that of normal volunteers (1.0 +/- 0.2 h) and patients with mild renal failure (1.7 +/- 0.7 h, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since norfloxacin may be administered to patients also receiving theophylline, we studied the effect of norfloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline in 10 healthy male volunteers. A randomized, crossover study design with a 2-week washout period between treatments was used. Subjects received oral theophylline (200 mg of aminophylline [theophylline ethylenediamine]) three times daily for 4 days either alone or with 400 mg of norfloxacin (orally) twice daily for the same period. Theophylline concentrations in serum were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) at 0, 3, 4, 10, and 12 h following the final dose in the norfloxacin treatment group than in the group receiving only theophylline. However, mean theophylline oral clearance was not significantly different between the two treatments (2.85 +/- 0.68 liters/h without norfloxacin versus 2.56 +/- 0.53 liters/h with norfloxacin [P = 0.08]). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in theophylline half-life (P = 0.11). We conclude that norfloxacin is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on theophylline disposition in most patients.\r"

For some isolates, exposure of the inoculum to increased temperature resulted in higher persister counts and diminution or loss of the paradoxical effect. The persister patterns for three representative S. aureus isolates are presented to illustrate the strain- and temperature-dependent nature of the phenomenon. For any isolate, the net effect appears to be caused by an interplay of temperature-induced inoculum loss and temperature-induced cell division cycle blockage. A modification of the agar dilution plate count inoculation step to circumvent such problems is described.\r"

Drug levels in plasma and the peritoneal dialysis fluid were analyzed at frequent intervals, and various pharmacokinetic variables were calculated for a one-compartment open model. Data obtained in the present study suggest that while no significant difference in peak plasma levels or volume of distribution were noted, the following variables were significantly different for imipenem as compared with cilastatin: elimination half-life, total plasma clearance, area under the concentration-time curve, and percent drug excretion in the peritoneal dialysis fluid. The elimination half-life of imipenem (3.28 h) or cilastatin (8.84 h) in our patients was in the same range as observed in patients with minimal renal function undergoing hemodialysis. The dose of imipenem-cilastatin should be reduced appropriately in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing peritoneal dialysis.\r"

In the first study the pharmacokinetics of cefetamet were evaluated after intravenous infusion of doses ranging from 133 to 2,650 mg. Over this dose range, the pharmacokinetics were linear. A dose-proportional increase in the area under the curve from zero to infinity was observed, whereas total clearance (140.3 +/- 23.6 ml/min), renal clearance (130.3 +/- 18.2 ml/min), volume of distribution at steady state (0.288 +/- 0.023 liter/kg), fraction excreted unchanged in the urine (94 +/- 11%), and elimination half-life (2.07 +/- 0.18 h) were independent of dose. In a second study the absolute bioavailability of single 1,500-mg doses of a tablet formulation of the pivaloyloxymethylester of cefetamet was evaluated under conditions of fasting and after a standard breakfast. Administration with food increased the extent of absorption (from 31 +/- 7 to 44 +/- 4%) while decreasing the rate of absorption (time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma increased from 3.0 +/- 0.6 to 4.8 +/- 0.4 h). The third study consisted of multiple oral administration of 1,000 mg of a similar oral tablet formulation twice daily for 10 days. This regimen was preceded and followed by intravenous administration of a 500-mg bolus dose of cefetamet. Oral doses were administered with breakfast and dinner. The absolute bioavailability of the tablet formulation was assessed after the first dose and after both the morning and the evening doses on day 10 of oral therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser at 577 nm was evaluated in the treatment of port-wine stains. The degree of lesional lightening was compared following laser exposure with pulse durations of 20 and 360 microseconds. In addition, lesional therapy using the 360-microseconds pulse duration was evaluated for lightening and side effects following long-term patient observation and after repeated treatments of the same site. A total of 52 patients with port-wine stain were treated; their average age was 29 years, with eight patients less than 18 years, of whom 29 had comparative test site placement for the different pulse durations. Of these 29 patients, 25 demonstrated greater lightening at the 360-microseconds pulse duration test site. All 52 patients proceeded to receive full treatment placement with the 360-microseconds pulse duration, which resulted in an overall lightening of 42% after the initial treatment and 68% after re-treatment sessions. Forty-four percent of the patients had equal to or greater than 75% lesional lightening. Pretreatment anesthesia was unnecessary and only minimum posttreatment care was required. Mild adverse effects of epidermal change, depression, or pigmentary change appeared in only four cases and was limited to less than a 2% area in each of these lesions. These side effects did not recur when the lesions were re-treated at lower energy dosages. No posttreatment sclerosis or scarring appeared, even after multiple retreatment sessions to the same area, regardless of the anatomic location, color of the lesion, or age of the patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Within a few hours all patients developed skin lesions, consisting of sharply demarcated erythema with multiple vesicles and large bullae. There was a striking predisposition for parts of the skin that were relatively moist or subject to mechanical pressure, such as axillae, groin, and abdomen. Microscopically, early skin lesions revealed necrosis of keratinocytes, severe edema of the upper dermis, subepidermal blistering, and diffuse infiltration of neutrophils and, to a lesser degree, eosinophils. Two patients developed an urticarial rash approximately one week after the exposure. On histologic examination, these late lesions showed combined features of a spongiotic dermatitis and urticaria. No immunopathologic manifestations were observed. In all patients, the skin returned to normal after four weeks, except for some residual hyperpigmentation. Plasma bromide levels after exposure strongly suggested percutaneous absorption of methyl bromide.\r"

  ".U": "88239747\r", 
  ".W": "Epidemiological data are often rejected for risk assessment purposes because of the lack of accurate exposure data. Animal data are frequently resorted for risk assessment calculations. Such a decision should account for potential errors in animal to human risk extrapolations, which may be of 1 or 2 orders of magnitude or more. Because historical human exposure can usually be estimated with confidence that the errors would be considerably less than 1 order of magnitude, it follows that human studies should generally take precedence over animal studies, even when crude assumptions have to be made concerning human exposure levels. This paper illustrates this with cancer risk assessments for vinyl chloride and antimony, both of which relied on use of the stipulated average cohort exposure levels without use of any individual exposure data for cohort members. Linear extrapolations of risk to low exposures were used in both instances. Non-cancer risk assessments were illustrated by examining results of experimental studies of effects of ozone on ventilatory function. A simple approach, in this case involving visual inspection of study results, was again recommended. Consideration was given to concerns about synergistic effects of low-level exposure to chemical mixtures. Calculations were presented to demonstrate that estimating risks by multiplying effects of individual chemicals produces the same risk estimated by adding effects, provided that exposure levels were sufficiently low for each individual agent. It was concluded that epidemiology has much to offer to environmental health risk assessment, but that epidemiologists need to be more effective in justifying the scientific basis of the design and interpretation of epidemiological studies to laboratory scientists, who frequently reject epidemiological findings for inappropriate reasons.\r"

A highly significant difference was observed in the conduction latency means of the BR components (p less than .0001), when the study population was compared with laboratory controls (N = 27).

All cases of CNS defects for a \"high\" and a \"low\" prevalence area of New Brunswick, for the years 1973-1983, were included in the study. Controls were selected randomly from the livebirth files for the province, matched on county of maternal residence and date of birth. One hundred and thirty (130) cases were identified and individually matched with two controls each. Individual water samples were collected from the case and control mother's address given on the birth or stillbirth records. The study revealed that the effect of nitrate exposure in water was modified by whether the source of the drinking water was a private well or a public municipal distribution system. Compared to a baseline nitrate level of 0.1 ppm, exposure to nitrate levels of 26 ppm from private well water sources was associated with a moderate, but not statistically significant, increase in risk (risk odds ratio = 2.30; 95% confidence interval = 0.73-7.29). If the source of drinking water was a municipal distribution system or a private spring, an increase in nitrate exposure was associated with a decrease in risk of delivering a CNS-malformed infant; however, these effect estimates were not statistically significant. The positive increase in risk with nitrate exposure from well water sources requires further study using a larger case series and a larger proportion of exposures to nitrate levels exceeding 5 ppm.\r"

Quantification of ozone effects under natural conditions of exposure can provide valuable information for risk assessment. However, results of epidemiological studies on acute ozone effects have had a limited role in decisions for air quality standards. This reflects difficulties in the quantitative interpretation of results that are to some extent inherent in the epidemiological approach, such as the difficulty of assessing individual exposures, failure to account for varying activity levels, and confounding by temporal covariates, e.g., temperature and pollen. However, in spite of the limitations of individual studies, when viewed as a group the epidemiological studies are consistent among themselves and with results from chamber studies.\r"

A multiphase approach for implementing epidemiologic studies in such settings was used in assessing the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD, or dioxin) contaminations in Missouri, where waste oil mixtures contaminated with dioxins were sprayed on various sites throughout the state for dust control in 1971. Although the toxic effects of dioxin have been studied extensively in animals and documented in cases of accidental high-level exposure in humans, very little is known of the human health effects, if any, produced by long-term exposure to relatively low levels of dioxin. In addition to medical epidemiologic studies, which were done to evaluate the types of problems present in groups of individuals with high-risk of environmental dioxin exposure, other studies to characterize dioxin levels in adipose tissue and serum are under way in a sample of potentially exposed (as well as in unexposed) Missouri residents. Research in these areas will continue to be pursued to develop a more complete understanding of the risks and appropriate public health interventions in situations of community exposure to environmental dioxins and other environmental contaminants.\r"

Xuan Wei's very high indoor air pollution levels (sometimes exceeding 20 mg/m3), residentially stable population, relatively uncomplicated lifestyle, and wide geographic variation in lung cancer mortality render it highly amenable to quantitative, interdisciplinary investigation of chemical carcinogens due to indoor air pollution. To date, epidemiologic findings reveal a closer association of lung cancer with the indoor burning of \"smoky\" coal (as opposed to \"smokeless\" coal or wood) than with tobacco use or occupation. Current aerometric, chemical, and toxicologic findings tend to confirm this association, though the specific carcinogenic constituents of Xuan Wei indoor air pollution have not yet been determined. Chinese and American investigators are conducting interdisciplinary field and laboratory investigations to quantify the lung cancer risk attendant on indoor air pollution relative to other factors, to measure and compare the characteristics of pollution from different Xuan Wei fuels, to determine the relative etiologic importance of pollution composition and concentration, and to develop quantitative relationships between air pollution dose and lung cancer risk.\r"

This is an intricate problem with many facets to consider. Among the exposure and risk assumption issues discussed are application of dioxin and furan equivalency factors; acceptable daily intake levels; cancer risk levels; and exposure scenarios including food, air, dermal, and soil ingestion. The range of regulatory options run from banning any application of dioxin-contaminated sludge to establishing acceptable or tolerable contamination limits. A preliminary assessment of potential human exposure scenarios found a many thousand-fold range of risk.\r"

The children were first studied in 1980, before the power plant went into operation, and in 1983 after two units were operating. They performed pulmonary function tests (PFT), and their parents filled out American Thoracic Society-National Heart and Lung Institute health questionnaires. In the younger cohort, respiratory symptoms and pneumonia and measles were more common in 1983 than in 1980, while in the older cohort pneumonia and measles showed higher prevalence in 1983 but most respiratory symptoms became less common. Temporal changes in prevalence of respiratory symptoms and diseases and annual increases in PFT within three communities in the region with different expected levels of pollution were analyzed. It appears that effects of age, epidemics, and background variables rather than environmental pollution are responsible for the observed differences.\r"

Their surface water has been disinfected with chlorine or a combination of chlorine and ammonia (cloramine) since 1938. The mortality ratio for bladder cancer among individuals who resided only in communities supplied with drinking water disinfected with chlorine, relative to individuals who resided only in communities supplied with drinking water disinfected with chloramine, was 1.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.1), using all controls; when the comparison group was restricted to individuals who died of lymphoma, the mortality odds ratio was 2.7 (95% confidence interval = 1.7-4.3).\r"

Recognition of causal associations between exposure and disease requires an understanding of the nature of data upon which such associations are based and of the limitations that affect such data. Data concerned with disease detection are often affected by long and variable latencies, clinical nonspecificity, low frequencies (small population sizes), and reporting biases. Data concerned with measuring exposures must take into account pathway uncertainties, probable low dose levels, inability to develop dose-response information, and the frequent necessity to rely on indirect surrogates for dose estimation. Where such difficulties can be overcome, epidemiologic analysis can be decisive in identifying causal relationships. More often, data limitations require more limited conclusions. Case studies from New York, Michigan, South Carolina, and Massachusetts illustrate the impact of these principles on the process of health risk assessment.\r"

Illustrations of markers in the categories of internal dose, biological effective dose, biological response, disease, and susceptibility are presented with a theoretical model for the interrelationship among these. Issues faced by epidemiologists in selecting markers for specific studies concern exposure complexity, marker specificity, marker persistence, time to appearance, and the use of target vs. surrogate biological media. Feasibility issues concern sample collection, transport, storage, and characteristics of the laboratory assay. The rationale for biological markers in epidemiologic research is strong in that markers have the potential for (1.) improving the accuracy of our \"exposure variables,\" (2.) permitting the identification of preclinical disease and providing opportunities for prevention, (3.) allowing for more homogeneous and etiologically relevant classifications of disease, and (4.) enhancing our understanding of the biological processes leading to disease occurrence, thereby strengthening the interpretation of epidemiologic data and the theoretical framework from which we formulate research questions.\r"

Occupational epidemiology can improve the methods for the assessment of the actual total exposure and health risk in environmental epidemiology by providing higher dose cohort data.\r"

Studies in 26 rats indicated that bacteremia and endotoxemia was present in 50% and 87%, respectively, by the end of 2 hours at a mean arterial pressure of 30 mmHg. Observations in 50 patients admitted to the trauma unit showed that positive bacterial blood cultures were present in 56% when the admission systolic blood pressure was 80 mmHg or less (p less than 0.01 compared with either of the other groups). Endotoxemia was noticed in two such patients. Direct access of bacteria and endotoxin to the blood stream may occur during hemorrhagic or traumatic shock and is the probable cause of subsequent sepsis in traumatized patients when no other source is apparent.\r"

Resuscitative thoracotomy for cardiovascular collapse was required in 13 patients (42%). Juxtahepatic venous injuries included the vena cava in 23 patients (74%) and the hepatic veins alone in five patients (16%). One patient had an isolated portal venous injury, and two patients died before their vascular injuries could be delineated. Technical problems related to the shunt occurred in seven patients. Most were related to delays in placement or problems encountered in obtaining vascular control of the suprarenal vena cava. Major hepatic resection was performed in 11 patients (35%). Twenty-five patients died of their injuries. No patient survived who required resuscitative thoracotomy, hepatic resection, or when technical problems with the shunt occurred. Six patients (19%) survived and were discharged from the hospital. All sustained gunshot wounds to the retro-hepatic vena cava. Four of the six survivors had serious postoperative complications, but none were related to the shunt. Major juxtahepatic venous injuries are highly lethal. The atriocaval shunt will permit the salvage of some patients where other methods are not possible. Avoidance of delay and alternative shunting techniques that eliminate difficult maneuvers may improve survival in the future.\r"

Four hundred splenectomies (20 per year) were performed between 1963 and 1982 compared with 94 (5.5 per year) between 1946 and 1962. Also noted in Series II was a sharp decline in the number performed each year between 1974 and 1983. The major factor responsible for these observations was the evolution of the staging laparotomy for malignant lymphomas, particularly Hodgkin's disease, and the decline in the average annual incidence of staging laparotomies since 1974. Staging laparotomy currently is rarely done for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Also contributing to the changes noted was an increase in the total number but subsequent fall in the annual incidence of splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis, idiopathic hypersplenism, and myeloproliferative disorders in Series II. The average number of splenectomies for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura increased from 1.1 per year in Series I to 3.6 per year in Series II; the annual incidence during the study period of Series II, however, remained constant. The total number of splenectomies for hairy cell leukemia and Felty's syndrome increased from zero in Series I to 12 and 17, respectively, in Series II, whereas the number of miscellaneous reasons dropped from 29 (1.7 per year) in Series I to 15 (0.75 per year) in Series II. The mortality rate in Series I was 6.3% compared with 4.0% in Series II. No deaths occurred in Series II after 1979. Indications for splenectomy in Series II were for diagnostic purposes in 3.2%, therapeutic in 56.5%, staging in 39.5%, and restaging in 0.8%. Accessory spleens were found in 49 (12.5%) in Series II.\r"

General anesthesia was administered in only 13% of PEG placements compared with 64% of Stamm gastrostomies. The cost of PEG was about $1000 less than for Stamm gastrostomies. The average time after surgery until use of the feeding tube was 1.8 days for PEG compared with 3.4 days for Stamm (p less than 0.0001). The overall complication rate after PEG was 8.8% (4.0% major) compared with 23.9% for Stamm gastrostomies (10.2% major) (p less than 0.005). PEG reduces operative time, necessity for general anesthesia, expense of insertion, incidence of complications, and requires less recovery time before use.

Forty-six morbidly obese patients, 26 with and 20 without OHS, underwent preoperative pulmonary artery catheterization. Although the two groups had similar values for percent ideal body weight, blood pressure, and cardiac index, the OHS patients had significantly higher mean pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), p less than 0.0001, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures (PAOP), p less than 0.01. Eighteen OHS patients were restudied 3-9 months after gastric surgery. PaO2 increased from 50 +/- 10 to 69 +/- 14 mmHg, p less than 0.0001, and PaCO2 decreased from 52 +/- 7 to 42 +/- 4 mmHg, p less than 0.0001), after the loss of 42 +/- 19% excess weight. These changes were associated with significant decreases in PAP (from 36 +/- 14 to 23 +/- 7 mmHg, p less than 0.0001) and PAOP (from 17 +/- 7 to 12 +/- 6 mmHg, p less than 0.01). Significant correlations were noted between PAP and PAOP (r = +0.8, p less than 0.0001) and PAP and PaO2 (r = -0.6, p less than 0.0001). Both left ventricular dysfunction, defined as a PAOP greater than or equal to 18 mmHg, as well as pulmonary artery vasoconstriction, defined as PAEDP greater than 5 mmHg above PAOP, contributed to pulmonary hypertension in OHS patients. In conclusion, weight loss after gastric surgery for morbid obesity significantly improved arterial blood gases and hemodynamic function in OHS patients.\r"

Indications for surgery were persistent jaundice in 29 and recurrent cholangitis in two. The mean serum bilirubin level before surgery was 10.4 mg/dl. Liver biopsy revealed that 26 patients had varying degrees of hepatic fibrosis, and five patients had progressed to secondary biliary cirrhosis. In 29 patients the major obstructive duct disease was at or near the hepatic duct bifurcation, and in two patients it was in the distal common duct. The operative procedure consisted of: (1) excision of the hepatic duct bifurcation and extrahepatic biliary tree, (2) dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts, (3) insertion of Silastic transhepatic biliary stents, and (4) bilateral hepaticojejunostomies. Two of the five patients (40%) with cirrhosis died after surgery. In contrast, only one of 26 patients (3.9%) with hepatic fibrosis died after operation. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival rates for patients with cirrhosis were 20%, 20%, and 20%, respectively. The only long-term survivor underwent a liver transplant. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival rates for patients with hepatic fibrosis were 92%, 87%, and 71%, respectively. In addition, the mean serum bilirubin levels of patients with hepatic fibrosis at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 3.4 mg/dl, 2.9 mg/dl, 4.0 mg/dl, 5.4 mg/dl, and 4.3 mg/dl, respectively. Two of the long-term survivors subsequently underwent a liver transplant. Patients with sclerosing cholangitis, persistent jaundice, and biliary cirrhosis should be referred for consideration of liver transplantation. However, in the absence of biliary cirrhosis, if the major obstructive disease is at the hepatic duct bifurcation, primary biliary reconstruction and long-term stenting should be considered.\r"

In one group, a vascularized muscle flap was used to patch a 2- to 3-cm aortic defect. In two other groups, a short segment of aorta was removed and a 2-cm tube graft of freshly harvested but devascularized skeletal muscle or Vicryl mesh was used to repair the aorta. Swine were followed for up to sixteen months after implantation. There were no deaths or graft-related complications in the vascularized muscle patch group, and after sixteen months, there were no stenoses or aneurysmal dilatations of the flaps. Histologically, a mature pseudointimal layer had been deposited under the muscle flap and was grossly indistinguishable from normal arterial wall. In the group that received devascularized muscle tube grafts, however, suture line dehiscences occurred in 3 of 7 animals within two weeks of operation. There were no dehiscences in the 9 recipients of a Vicryl tube graft, a finding suggesting that deposition of pseudointimal elements was rapid enough to ensure vascular integrity as the Vicryl was absorbed. Postmortem examination of these animals demonstrated stenoses ranging from 30 to 50%, thereby indicating a lack of growth in the new pseudointimal wall. These results demonstrate the long-term reliability of vascularized skeletal muscle for use in major vascular reconstruction, and suggest the beneficial effects of avoiding prosthetic material and promoting optimal pseudointimal formation.\r"

  ".W": "Profound hypothermia protects cerebral function during circulatory arrest in the surgical treatment of a variety of cardiac and aortic abnormalities. Despite its importance, techniques to determine the appropriate level of hypothermia vary; studies of temperatures recorded from multiple peripheral body sites show inconsistent findings. The purpose of this study is to establish objective criteria to consistently identify intraoperatively the safe level of hypothermia. Our studies are based on experimental evidence showing a correlation between brain temperature and development of electrocerebral silence (ECS) on the electroencephalogram (EEG), and the recognition that the EEG, as an objective measure of brain function, can easily be recorded intraoperatively. We studied 56 patients who required circulatory arrest during operation for replacement of the ascending aorta or aortic arch (N = 55) or aortic valve replacement (N = 1). Peripheral body temperatures from the nasopharynx, esophagus, and rectum and the EEG were continuously recorded during body cooling. Circulatory arrest time ranged from 14 to 109 minutes. No peripheral body temperature from a single site or from a combination of sites consistently predicted ECS. There was a wide variation in temperature among body sites when ECS occurred: nasopharyngeal, 10.1 degrees to 24.1 degrees C; esophageal, 7.2 degrees to 23.1 degrees C; rectal, 12.8 degrees to 28.6 degrees C. Fifty-one (91%) of the 56 patients survived. Three had neurological deficits, none clearly related to hypothermia. Two patients (3.6%) required reexploration for postoperative bleeding. We conclude that monitoring the EEG to identify ECS is a safe, consistent, and objective method of determining the appropriate level of hypothermia.\r"

  ".W": "Optimal methods of myocardial preservation in the neonate remain unknown. Hypothermia and cardioplegia have been shown to protect neonatal hearts, but few studies have examined the effects of cardioplegia when administered at normothermia. Accordingly, the role of 37 degrees C St. Thomas' cardioplegic solution in protecting the neonatal heart during 1 hour of ischemia in an isolated working rabbit heart model was examined. Both oxygenated and nonoxygenated cardioplegic solutions (CSs) were evaluated and compared with an oxygenated physiological saline solution (PSS). Following ischemia, control hearts were characterized by severely impaired left ventricular function, whereas all three treatment groups recovered well, indicating that the treatments provided substantial protection. Aortic flow recovered to 62, 63, and 57% of preischemic values for the oxygenated CS, nonoxygenated CS, and oxygenated PSS groups, respectively. Similarly, rate of change of pressure recovered to 76, 80, and 76% of preischemic values for oxygenated CS, nonoxygenated CS, and oxygenated PSS groups. All values were significantly greater than those for the control group. Recovery of developed pressure was significantly improved in all three groups. End-diastolic pressure rose markedly following ischemia in control hearts, was not increased after ischemia in hearts receiving oxygenated and nonoxygenated CS, but was increased in the oxygenated PSS group. These data indicate that crystalloid cardioplegia and oxygenated PSS provide substantial protection in neonatal rabbit hearts, even when delivered at 37 degrees C. No additional benefit was seen when the cardioplegic solution was oxygenated. Therefore, either method of balancing the oxygen supply/demand ratio appears to be beneficial: supplying oxygen intermittently during ischemia (oxygenated PSS group) or decreasing oxygen demand during the ischemic period (cardioplegia groups).\r"

Mortality among the 1,919 operations was 115 (6%). In the study group of 1,804 operations resulting in survival for at least 30 days, the following factors were analyzed: type of operation, age, sex, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class, urgency of operation, preoperative myocardial infarction (MI), weight, body surface area, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous cardiac operation, smoking history, and family history of cardiac disease. The overall mean length of hospitalization was 10.7 +/- 5.6 days. The analyses indicated that valve operation, age less than 30 and greater than 60 years, female sex, NYHA Class IV, urgent operation, preoperative MI 1 to 4 weeks before operation, and diabetes mellitus requiring medical treatment prolonged hospitalization, but generally by only 2 days. Major prolongation of hospitalization was associated with age in the 20- to 30-year and 80- to 90-year brackets. Unexpectedly, heavy body weight and smoking were not predictive.\r"

The infundibular septum was totally resected to reduce the muscular outflow stenosis. Short patch infundibuloplasty with a large monocusp was then used. Instead of the tricuspid septal leaflet, the membranous flap was employed as the suture line for patching the ventricular septal defect (VSD) to avoid a conduction disturbance, residual VSD, and fixing of the tricuspid septal leaflet. The right ventricular (RV) to systemic arterial pressure ratio was 50.0 +/- 14.6% (N = 26) and right atrial pressure was 9.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg (N = 26) one month after operation. RV end-diastolic volume was 93.0 +/- 30.5% of normal (N = 15) before operation and 96.7 +/- 29.0% of normal one month after operation in the same patients. These data suggest that a conotruncal repair can maintain good RV function with low right atrial pressure and with no increase of RV volume.\r"

Coronary perfusion pressure decreased to 37 +/- 2 mm Hg with tamponade and 39 +/- 1 mm Hg with hemorrhage, causing significant blood flow decreases in both ventricles. Myocardial oxygen extraction increased significantly in both groups without affecting lactate extraction. Volume resuscitation after hemorrhage progressively restored hemodynamic variables to baseline values. Volume resuscitation after tamponade did not increase stroke volume, whereas it increased coronary sinus pressure to 19.2 +/- 1.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Coronary perfusion pressure increased to 53 +/- 5 mm Hg following the first infusion (p less than 0.05), but exhibited no further improvement. Tamponade did not produce myocardial ischemia. Coronary perfusion pressure and blood flow were not restored to baseline values with volume resuscitation since coronary sinus pressure rose incrementally with each volume infusion.\r"

However, using two enzyme determinations, performed at least six hours apart, we were able to identify a large percentage of our patients with unstable angina who were at low risk for myocardial infarction. Patients with two consecutive normal creatinine kinase levels had only a 2% chance of having an acute myocardial infarction. We believe these data can assist physicians where monitored beds are in short supply to make judicious use of this limited resource; the subsequent reduction in critical care unit admissions and duration of stay could result in substantial monetary savings.\r"

The serum urate (as uric acid) concentration was also low in seven patients. Endogenous creatinine clearance was increased in all patients (2.38 to 14.75 mL/s [143 to 885 mL/min]). However, inulin clearance measured in four patients was reduced (25 to 32 mL/min) and the creatinine-to-inulin clearance ratio ranged from 4.5 to 9.9. This range can be explained largely by an increased tubular secretion of creatinine related to body fluid expansion caused by a large fluid infusion. Renal function would be extremely overestimated when assessed from serum concentrations or clearance of creatinine in such patients.\r"

All patients were given heparin, for a mean (+/- SEM) period of 8.8 +/- 0.4 days. A high percentage of patients (60%) did not have a single partial thromboplastin time (PTT) greater than 1.5 times control within the first 24 hours of heparin therapy. Not until day 8 were 90% of PTTs in therapeutic range. We identified five common practices that led to delays in achieving a PTT greater than 1.5 times the laboratory control: (1) failure to start heparin therapy at the time of initial clinical suspicion, (2) choice of a heparin sodium bolus (mean, 5861 +/- 365 U) and continuous infusion (1026 +/- 148 U/h) insufficient to elevate the PTT to greater than 1.5 times control, (3) delay in obtaining the first PTT (mean, 11.7 +/- 1 h after start of heparin therapy), (4) insufficient heparin dosing in response to a low PTT, and (5) excessive and prolonged reductions in heparin therapy in response to a PTT greater than three times control, leading to subtherapeutic levels in 56% of subsequent PTTs. We think that poor understanding of heparin kinetics, overcautious behavior of physicians, and high heparin requirements in this selected population account for the findings.\r"

Most patients were in the sixth to seventh decade of life, and the male-to-female ratio was 32:18. Most patients were of normal or low weight, few had known risk factors for DVT, and all but three had general anesthesia. Venography performed on the operated on legs on the seventh to tenth postoperative days showed that only two patients had DVT, one in the calf and another in the calf and thigh veins. The low incidence of DVT in the Thai population even after such extensive surgery, which is associated with a high (40% to 70%) frequency of DVT in the Western world, suggests that routine prophylactic anticoagulant measures are not presently needed in this country.\r"

  ".W": "Patients (n = 10) at the acute phase of farmer's lung were investigated with chest roentgenography, lung function tests, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis (n = 9). They had diffuse interstitial lung infiltrates and a reduction of the diffusion capacity. The dominating recovered cell types during BAL were lymphocytes; and in two patients, granulocytes. A prominent increase in mast cell numbers was seen in all patients. After avoidance of contact with moldy plant material for four to ten weeks (n = 7), lung function started to improve; and the BAL cell counts, to decrease. At clinical remission six to 14 months later (n = 7), the chest roentgenogram was normal and the diffusion capacity was slightly subnormal. The BAL numbers of mast cells and lymphocytes had further decreased but still remained increased compared with those in the healthy controls. Parallel to the normalization of the lung function and the recovery of BAL fluid cells, the increased BAL fluid concentrations of hyaluronic acid and procollagen III peptide started to decrease. These potential markers of fibroblast activation were significantly related to the mast cell number, but not to the lymphocyte number. The study has demonstrated that pulmonary mastocytosis is a prominent finding in farmer's lung and is related to the disease activity. The observed relationship between pulmonary mastocytosis and biochemical signs of lung fibroblast activation is further evidence to support the hypothesis of a mast cell interaction with lung connective tissue.\r"

Physicians primarily order a preoperative urinalysis to detect infection, because of the purported relationship between remote infection and surgical wound infection. We found that preoperative urinalysis is uniformly ordered, with a high prevalence of abnormal results (15%) but a low physician-response rate (29%). Wound infection was rare, but there was no difference in frequency of wound infection between patients with normal and abnormal results of urinalysis. We conclude that the utility of routine preoperative urinalysis is unproven. Current practice does not agree with the rationale for ordering this test, nor does published literature support it. Although data are inadequate to fully define the appropriate use of preoperative urinalysis, we suggest clinical recommendations and avenues for further research.\r"

In spite of the professed ideal of improving physician-patient communication, many commentators have argued that it interferes with the relationship. However, the problem may not be the doctrine itself but rather the manner in which it is usually implemented. This article describes two different ways in which informed consent can be implemented. The event model treats informed consent as a procedure to be performed once in each treatment course, which must cover all legal elements at that time. The process model, in contrast, tries to integrate informing the patient into the continuing dialogue between physician and patient that is a routine part of diagnosis and treatment. We suggest that the process model has many benefits.\r"

We estimated the expected frequency of sporadic listeriosis based on hospital discharge data from the Professional Activity Study of the Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities for the years 1980 through 1982. The incidence of listeriosis was 3.6 per million population per year, with an estimated 800 cases occurring in the United States each year. Attack rates were highest in neonates and in those aged 70 years and older (568 and 11 per million population per year, respectively). Overall mortality was 19.1%, with mortality rates increasing with advancing age. We estimated that listeriosis accounts for at least 150 deaths in the United States per year (fetal mortality not included). Throughout the nation, no marked regional differences in the incidence of the disease were apparent. We were able to identify three time-space clusters, which suggests the possibility that a portion of sporadic cases may, in fact, be previously unrecognized common-source clusters.\r"

Though the cause of deterioration is well understood, the choice of a remedy is still controversial. Remedies include acid-free paper, computerization, deacidification, and microfilm. These techniques are reviewed for their reliability, comprehensiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Microfilm is recommended above other techniques as the most immediately promising solution.

A 68-year-old woman, clinically in a state of thyrotoxicosis as a result of taking 0.3 g/d of exogenous thyroid replacement, sustained a severe, reversible myocardial ischemic event. Echocardiographic and scintigraphic evaluations demonstrated a large apical dyskinetic region. Subsequently, after the original dose of levothyroxine sodium was reduced to 0.15 mg and the patient became euthyroid, two-dimensional echocardiography and scintigraphic and cardiac catheterization studies demonstrated normal left ventricular contractility and normal coronary anatomy. Coronary artery spasm was not induced by ergonovine maleate therapy. Exogenous thyroid administration may directly influence myocardial oxygen supply and demand, exclusive of coronary artery disease and coronary spasm. A critical imbalance may then result in acute myocardial ischemia and reversible left ventricular segmental wall motion abnormalities.\r"

A midsagittal section and twelve 1-cm coronal sections beginning at the frontal pole were obtained, and linear, area, and signal intensity measurements were made on nine brain regions. Volume estimates were made by summing consecutive sections for four of the following regions: the precallosal frontal lobes, temporal lobes, lateral ventricles, amygdala-hippocampal complexes, and cerebral hemispheres. The area of the third ventricle in its most anterior coronal slice was increased by 73% in schizophrenic subjects (0.83 +/- 0.08 cm2) in comparison with controls (0.48 +/- 0.04 cm2). Lateral ventricular volume was increased by 62% in schizophrenic subjects (24.7 +/- 2.6 mL) in comparison with controls (15.2 +/- 1.4 mL). The lateral ventricular enlargement in schizophrenic subjects was more pronounced posteriorly than anteriorly, especially at the level of the anterior thalamus and the colliculi. There were no other significant differences between schizophrenic and control groups in any other spatial or signal intensity measures. There was no brain region the size of which correlated with ventricular size. These data corroborate third and lateral ventriculomegaly in schizophrenia using magnetic resonance imaging but fail to further localize the structural abnormality.\r"

Plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine samples were obtained before and during debrisoquin administration and were assayed for their content of norepinephrine and dopamine metabolites, ie, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), homovanillic acid (HVA), and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. The severity of the patient's schizophrenic symptoms was also assessed with several types of rating scales. During debrisoquin administration there were significant reductions in plasma, urine, and CSF MHPG levels. Regression analyses suggested that the reduction in CSF MHPG level was probably due to the reduction in plasma MHPG level, which contributes to the CSF MHPG pool. Debrisoquin administration was not associated with changes in CSF HVA level, although it did produce marked reductions in plasma and urinary HVA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels. Significant correlations between plasma and CSF concentrations of HVA were noted during, but not before, debrisoquin administration. Before debrisoquin administration there were trends toward positive relationships between symptom severity and plasma HVA concentrations, which became stronger and statistically significant during debrisoquin administration. These data suggest that debrisoquin may be used as a research tool to create a condition in which measures of HVA in peripheral body fluids reflect dopamine system function and metabolism within the central nervous system.\r"

Thus, those patients who had the greatest change in plasma homovanillic acid in response to neuroleptic blockade showed the greatest improvement.

  ".W": "The characteristics of adolescent suicide victims (n = 27) were compared with those of a group at high risk for suicide, suicidal psychiatric inpatients (n = 56) who had either seriously considered (n = 18) or actually attempted (n = 38) suicide. The suicide victims and suicidal inpatients showed similarly high rates of affective disorder and family histories of affective disorder, antisocial disorder, and suicide, suggesting that among adolescents there is a continuum of suicidality from ideation to completion. However, four putative risk factors were more prevalent among the suicide victims: (1) diagnosis of bipolar disorder; (2) affective disorder with comorbidity; (3) lack of previous mental health treatment; and (4) availability of firearms in the homes, which taken together accurately classified 81.9% of cases. In addition, suicide completers showed higher suicidal intent than did suicide attempters. These findings suggest a profile of psychiatric patients at high risk for suicide, and the proper identification and treatment of such patients may prevent suicide in high-risk clinical populations.\r"

These findings are consistent with those of previous reports, suggesting a difference between the way suicidal persons with substance abuse and pure affective disorder respond to certain external stressors.\r"

HMB-45 recognized all of eight melanomas and stained one of five neuroblastomas, but failed to label any of 12 cases of NPC. All examples of ONBL were stained by anti-synaptophysin; other tumors were nonreactive with this reagent. A panel of antibodies to cytokeratin, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen, and S100 protein was also effective in discriminating between MM, NPC and ONBL. These results suggest that HMB-45 and anti-synaptophysin are comparable in utility to more extended antibody panels in the diagnosis of sinonasal malignancies, but only if used in combination with one another.\r"

Clinically, they had a similar presentation: advanced disease at onset, diffuse abdominal spread, poor treatment response, and rapid progression. Pathologically, the four cases were characterized by a striking degree of cellular and nuclear pleomorphism and anaplasia with bizarre and monstrous expressions. Although some authors have referred to the immature ganglion cells found in neuroblastoma as \"bizarre ganglion cells,\" they usually mean the enlarged, maturing neuroblasts that are typical of ganglioneuroblastoma but far from the extreme anaplasia seen in our cases. A correlation between the clinical course and the histological picture could be hypothetically suggested, but additional evidence and confirmation is needed. These cellular aberrations might represent an unsuccessful and impaired attempt at maturation. Independent from prognosis, the definition of anaplastic neuroblastoma is a useful conceptual specification in the study of this tumor and of giant cell and pleomorphic malignant neoplasms of childhood.\r"

Tangential takeoff of the vessel with resultant slitlike ostium and its initial investment in the aortic adventitia with diastolic entrapment and compression are both thought to be at play. Since 1983, three infants with this anomaly and associated sudden death have been described. We describe a fourth case and offer an assessment of the overall frequency of this potentially fatal abnormality.\r"

(2) Low z-scores give a false impression of dysfunction because able-bodied subjects are often grossly overqualified for the application in question; they may have levels of strength or quickness several orders of magnitude greater than what is needed to do the assessment task. A recommended alternative is to describe the performance of disabled individuals using nonparametric statistics, and to report scores in boxplots, showing the extremes, the median, and the quartiles. Such points are easy to calculate and to interpret, and they are robust against outliers.\r"

Beginning on the fifth day after compression, ultrasound thermotherapy of 0.5 or 1.0watt/cm2 was applied over the area of nerve compression in one limb for one minute three times per week. The other side (control) was not treated. Motor distal latency (DL), motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of the segment with nerve compression, and amplitude of the evoked compound muscle action potential (ACMAP) were measured before and immediately after nerve compression and two or three times per week after compression. The recovery rates of NCV and ACMAP of the tibial nerve treated with ultrasound of 0.5watt/cm2 were significantly faster than those of the control nerve. There was no significant change in the recovery rate of DL. However, if ultrasound of 1.0watt/cm2 was applied, the recovery rate of ACMAP of the treated nerve was slower than that of the control nerve. There were no significant changes in the recovery rates of DL and NCV. Low doses of ultrasound thermotherapy may facilitate recovery of compression neuropathy, but higher doses may induce an adverse effect.\r"

Estimates of survival and frequency of institutionalization after stroke vary widely, depending on the patient population. A precise picture of variability of outcome from stroke may be obtained from a prospective epidemiologic study. This report uses the Framingham Study population sample of 5,184 men and women, aged 30 to 62 at entry in 1948, who were free of cardiovascular disease. All completed strokes that occurred between 1971 and 1981 were evaluated. Of the 213 patients with completed strokes, 154 survived more than 30 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that acute survival was negatively influenced by stroke type, severity of neurologic impairment, and age. For those who survived at least 30 days, independent living was determined by social factors as much as by severity of disability. Being married protected men but not women from institutionalization. Older women, married or not, with moderate to severe residual impairment and minimal education, were at highest risk of institutionalization. In acute stroke, medical factors dominated rates of survival. However, in those who survived, family and social factors had an equal impact in determining final outcome from stroke.\r"

Participants in the study demonstrated significantly slower performance on all items of the test for both the nonparetic and paretic hands when comparisons of scores were made with previously published norms. A further analysis of test results was made among all right-handed subjects. The left hemiplegic group performed all subtest items more slowly than right hemiplegic subjects with the weak hand. Performance with the nonparetic hand was significantly different between left and right hemiplegic subjects only on the writing subtest. These differences cannot be exclusively explained by either hand dominance or hemispheric specialization.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of closed head injury (CHI) associated with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) has been estimated at 40% to 50%. Closed head injury can be defined as the presence of loss of consciousness (LOC) and/or posttraumatic amnesia (PTA). Consequently, one of the difficulties in establishing a diagnosis of CHI is determining the existence of PTA in those patients without documented LOC. Previous work described the inconsistent evaluation of PTA in the SCI population. This study was conducted to evaluate the utility of the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) in establishing the diagnosis of CHI in a series of acute traumatic SCI patients. The GOAT was administered serially for three to five days to 34 patients admitted to our hospital. When information derived from the GOAT was added to that derived from review of medical records alone, the observed incidence of PTA (and by implication CHI) increased significantly (McNemar statistic = 6.4; p = 0.01). The GOAT is a quick, simple, and reproducible evaluation of spheres of orientation, which is extremely helpful in diagnosis of PTA in this population. This instrument should be used to evaluate patients at high risk for head injury. Although abnormalities in the GOAT evaluation may also be attributable to factors other than CHI (eg, hypoxia, medication effects), such findings provide evidence suggestive of CHI. This will help determine which patients require a more detailed neuropsychologic assessment.\r"

ANCOVA was used in most analyses to control for age at the time of injury and at present. Those married after injury reported greater satisfaction with their sex lives, living arrangements, social lives, health, emotional adjustment, and control over their lives, and they indicated that loneliness was less of a problem. They were also far more likely to be working and to be socially active outside their homes.\r"

A program that attempts to engender a high level of patient responsibility in a population of chronic low back pain patients is described. Self-managed reduction of drug dependence is a major component of this program. The data indicate that the program produces a significant reduction in dependence on opiates, derivatives, synthetic opiates, hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, and analgesics. Follow-up data (with attrition controlled) at six months and 12 months postdischarge do not provide any evidence for deterioration (ie, return to pretreatment levels of drug dependence). Thus, it appears that the programmatic impact is stable over at least a 12-month period postdischarge. Implications of these findings for the low back pain population, as well as other chronic pain populations, are discussed.\r"

We conducted a review of 107 requests for consultation from various acute care services at our hospital. After reviewing the referring physician's narrative summaries, we determined that 36% of 107 patients would require physiatric evaluation, and that the remaining patients could be \"passed through\" to PT for treatment. After evaluation of the medical records and examination of the patients, 54% of patients required physiatric assessment and only 45% could be \"passed through\" to PT. The hypothesis that this narrative information would be an adequate predictor of need for physiatric consultation was rejected at the p less than 0.005 level (chi 2 = 18.63; df = 1). In addition, the referring service indicated whether it wished PT or physiatry to evaluate the patient on the consultation form. The hypothesis that screening for the need for physiatric intervention by the indicated preference of the referral was rejected at the p less than 0.0005 level (chi 2 = 20.45; df = 1). We concluded that we could not reliably predict when patients required physiatric or only PT intervention based on the consultation request narrative. Ongoing physiatric involvement on a consultative basis, educational conferences, and other forms of education for house staff and attending physicians may serve to improve understanding of physiatric services and physiatric utilization.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were studied before, during, and after a 1-week total fast. Disease activity decreased, as did the neutrophil release of lysozyme induced by the ionophore A23187. The ability of zymosan-activated RA patient serum to aggregate control neutrophils was reduced, together with serum concentrations of C3. The relative contents of arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid were increased in serum, platelets, and neutrophils, whereas levels of linoleic acid and linolenic acid were unchanged. Fasting also reduced the release of leukotriene B4 from neutrophils. We thus conclude that a reduced ability to generate cytotaxins, reduced release of enzyme, and reduced leukotriene formation from RA neutrophils, together with an altered fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, may be mechanisms for the decrease of inflammatory symptoms that results from fasting.\r"

Dependent measures included pain, coping strategies, psychological status, functional status, and disease status. Data analysis at 12 months revealed benefits for the CB group in the area of enhanced coping strategies. Specifically, the CB subjects showed significantly greater use of coping strategies and significantly more confidence in their ability to manage pain. The findings are discussed in terms of the importance of enhanced self-efficacy and personal control for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Seventy-seven percent of patients with OA, but only 12% of control subjects, had serum levels which were more than 1 SD above the mean of the control group. Following replacement of a single osteoarthritic hip joint, serum KS levels decreased, at first, in all patients. Subsequently, the concentration of serum KS progressively increased; 6 months following surgery, KS levels were similar or close to the preoperative levels in virtually all patients. The results suggest that patients with hypertrophic OA may have a generalized imbalance of cartilage proteoglycan metabolism. Measurements of serum KS are likely to prove most useful in studying this particular subset of patients with generalized OA.\r"

During the period of 8-24 hours, mature collagen appeared in the space between pericyte layers and between pericytes and endothelial cells, and 2-9-fold increases in ferritin +, W3/13+, W3/25+, Ox8+, and Ox26+ mononuclear cells occurred. In contrast to the action on synovial fibroblasts, iron injection did not affect the mitotic activity of fibroblasts within the serosa of the small intestine. These findings demonstrate that, under experimental conditions, iron can readily induce changes in the synovium that are reminiscent of early events occurring in response to antigen.\r"

Parotid inflammation was seen in 6 of 11 patients whose minor salivary gland biopsy results indicated SS, but in none of 8 patients who had normal findings on minor salivary gland biopsy. Patients with parotid inflammation were older and had a higher frequency of dry eyes and mouth, abnormal results on Schirmer's test, serious extraglandular involvement, and serologic abnormalities.

  ".W": "In the evaluation of carpal tunnel syndrome by nerve conduction testing it is desirable to produce prognostic as well as diagnostic information. The finding of conduction block, or neurapraxia, is regarded as evidence that treatment can result in prompt recovery of nerve function. A technique is presented for stimulating the motor branch of the median nerve in the palm in order to detect the degree of neurapraxia due to entrapment in the carpus. In 23 normal subjects the response after palmar stimulation compared to a wrist stimulation site had a mean increase in amplitude of 0.56 mV. Persons affected with carpal tunnel syndrome had a mean amplitude increase of 2.2 mV demonstrating partial conduction block. The difference between these two values is statistically significant (P = 0.001). The routine use of this method is recommended both for more accurate diagnosis and for evaluation of the degree of neurapraxia.\r"

Of 39 patients consecutively admitted to the hospital, 23 (59%) developed a grade one ulcer within 30 days, mostly in the sacral region (57%), the peak time of onset being day 4 postinjury (6/23 cases). In partial support of an earlier retrospective study (Linares HA, Mawson AR, Suarez E, Biundo JJ Jr: Association between pressure sores and immobilization in the immediate post-injury period. Orthopedics 1987;10:571-573), duration of unrelieved pressure prior to ward admission was significantly associated with ulcers developing within the first eight days of injury (P = 0.04), but not with ulcers developing during the entire 30-day observation period (P = 0.09). Time on the spinal board was also significantly associated with ulcers developing within 8 days (P = 0.01), but not with ulcers developing within 30 days (P = 0.09). An unexpected finding was the significant inverse association between systolic blood pressure and the development of ulcers both within 8 days (P = 0.03) and within 30 days (P = 0.02), suggesting that reduced tissue perfusion increases the spinal cord-injured patient's susceptibility to pressure ulcers.\r"

Two groups were derived from negative ratings of life events and subject's age. Younger patients, who reported higher levels of life stress, also reported more depressive symptomatology; younger patients with lower levels of life stress reported fewer depressive symptoms. Both young and old patients with high stress reported higher levels of depressive symptomatology. Psychological disturbance was greater in the high life stress group as indicated by significant elevations on the global severity index of the Symptom Checklist-90 and elevations on somatization, obsessive compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety and psychoticism subscales.

Patients in this study were recruited in 1984 and followed prospectively for a 12-month period postdischarge. This analysis builds on previous studies which have called researchers to move beyond single-outcome studies which use only bivariate analysis. Multivariate techniques are used to evaluate the influence of a number of predictor variables on three measures of long-term outcome: 1) a composite variable that includes functional status, mortality and discharge disposition (home v nursing home); 2) life satisfaction; and 3) medical charges. The results show that 1) multivariate analyses present a different picture from that obtained when using bivariate analysis; and 2) the same predictor variables are not equally important in predicting different outcome variables. From 30-42% of the variance in the three dependent variables is explained by severity of illness, function at admission, age, wheelchair use and in- and out-of-house social supports.\r"

A novel surface interaction parameter, the gold nucleus density distribution (GND), determined by partial gold decoration transmission electron microscopy, was used to indirectly assess the dispersive contribution to interfacial surface free energy. A water wetting assay was used to characterize the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the polymer film surfaces. Two biological interaction parameters, one involving the kinetics of albumin and fibrinogen adsorption from plasma and the other a platelet adhesion index (RIPA), were used to estimate blood compatibility. Results indicate that mold properties influence the surface structure of this block co-polymer, sequestering polysiloxane groups at mold, and possibly air interfacial regions of the film. However, as shown by ESCA and FTIR analysis, specific chemical groups did not correlate with the blood compatibility indices. The GND correlate with initial albumin and fibrinogen adsorption rates. Initial protein adsorption was less well predicted by surface water wettability. Neither surface structure nor surface interaction data predicted later (60-120 min) protein sorption or platelet adhesion. Subsequent events may be influenced by protein turnover and cell-surface interactions, and are less influenced by polymer surface properties.\r"

Both agents were associated with significantly less fade during onset than during spontaneous offset.

The inter-individual variability of maintenance doses for the two drugs did not differ, the coefficients of variation being 0.32 and 0.24. On stopping the infusion, the patients given atracurium recovered to a 15% twitch faster than those given pancuronium. In addition neostigmine produced a quicker recovery in this group.

In group II a significant decrease in NK cell activity was found after operation for at least 3 days, while surgery during extradural analgesia did not induce significant changes. The impaired NK cell activity was accompanied by leucocytosis and lymphopenia affecting the T-lymphocytes (OKT3+ and OKT4+), the B-lymphocytes (B1+) and NK cells (Leu 11+). Compared with group II, extradural analgesia significantly reduced the cortisol and noradrenaline response to surgery, while the adrenaline response in both groups was abolished. The results suggest that the decrease in NK cell activity and alterations in lymphocyte subsets induced by surgery and general anaesthesia can be prevented to a certain degree by extradural analgesia.\r"

Complete motor blockade of the lower limbs developed most rapidly in group II, while duration of all degrees of motor blockade did not differ significantly with age. Because of great individual variation, the clinical significance of such differences is limited.

Comparable increases in cortisol and ACTH concentrations were demonstrated at the onset of bypass and the concentrations of both hormones increased during bypass. In the post-bypass period plasma cortisol concentration increased sharply; there was no further increase in the plasma ACTH concentration. By 24 h the concentrations of both hormones had declined towards baseline values. There were no significant differences between the groups.\r"

Two groups of 15 female patients took part in a 4-h, randomized double-blind, double-dummy study on the first day after elective abdominal hysterectomy. Meptazinol did not provide satisfactory analgesia in five patients (P less than 0.05). A decrease in mean pain scores (linear analogue scale and verbal rating scale) was seen after the administration of meptazinol, but this was not as great as that produced by morphine i.m., nor was it as long in duration. Significant changes in arterial pressure, heart rate and ventilatory rates were not seen in association with the administration of meptazinol, but were observed after the administration of morphine.\r"

The model measures VD/VT ratios in relation to fresh gas flow and the characteristic shape of the resulting curve characterizes the particular breathing system. The various curves reflect the functional performance and, therefore, the flow requirements of the systems which have been reclassified accordingly. The classification described is based upon the structural arrangements which determine the flow patterns within the particular systems. The breathing systems compared during spontaneous ventilation were a circle \"C\" absorber system, the circle \"C\" without the absorber, the Mapleson A, B, C and D systems and a series of \"enclosed\" and modified Mapleson A systems and the modified Mapleson D or Bain system.\r"

Postoperative morbidity, in particular nausea and vomiting, and ability to resume normal activity were assessed over the ensuing 48 h. Supplementary administration of propofol during the operative procedure was required significantly more often (P less than 0.05) in the absence of nitrous oxide. There was no significant difference in the incidence of vomiting before discharge when nitrous oxide was omitted. The incidence and severity of nausea over the 48 h following operation was similar in both groups. There was no difference in analgesic or anti-emetic requirements before discharge and the time taken to resume normal activity was similar. It is concluded that nitrous oxide may be avoided readily in day-case laparoscopy without affecting postoperative morbidity or time taken to return to \"street fitness\" and normal activity.\r"

Eighteen of the patients were investigated more extensively; in these subjects FRC was reduced below the control values of residual volume (RV) with the onset of anaesthesia, but recovered towards baseline after laparotomy incision. Reduction in FRC is related to baseline vital capacity (VC) and FRC and is much greater than that reported for patients of normal weight.\r"
