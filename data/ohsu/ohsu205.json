  ".U": "88054205\r", 
  ".W": "Right atrial hypertension has been considered to have a major physiologic influence on the formation of transudative pleural effusions. Since pleural fluid is thought to be cleared primarily by the parietal pleural lymphatic vessels that empty into the systemic veins, systemic venous hypertension secondary to right atrial hypertension should decrease the lymphatic drainage of the pleural space. We retrospectively studied nine patients and prospectively studied 18 patients with long-term right atrial or pulmonary arterial hypertension (or both). All patients had stable respiratory symptoms, and none had a significantly elevated pulmonary arterial wedge pressure. Our purpose was to determine the relationship of right atrial and pulmonary arterial hypertension to the development of transudative pleural effusions. Posteroanterior and bilateral decubitus chest roentgenograms and ultrasound were used to detect pleural effusions. Pleural effusions were not identified in any of the 27 patients, even in four patients with right atrial pressures greater than 20 mm Hg. We conclude that chronic elevation of right atrial pressure or pulmonary arterial pressure (or both) alone is not a cause of pleural effusion. In contrast, elevation of left atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures is associated with the formation of transudative pleural effusions in man. Thus, if pleural effusions are detected in patients who have cor pulmonale, a search should be made for coexisting left heart failure or a primary cause of pleural inflammation, such as pulmonary emboli or infection.\r"

Patients were divided into those surviving less (group A; n = 14) and more (group B; n = 24) than six months. Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas levels either on admission or while in a steady state, and nutritional parameters were similar in both groups. Only the duration of mechanical ventilation was longer in group A when compared to group B. In patients dying while being ventilated or surviving less than ten days after extubation, only the forced vital capacity (FVC) was different when compared to the rest of group A. The duration of mechanical ventilation was not related to age or the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Only a multivariate analysis accounting simultaneously for eight parameters could separate with 78 percent accuracy the different groups of patients; however, following this analysis, 23 percent of the patients in group B could have been falsely classified as nonsurvivors and perhaps rejected for mechanical ventilation. We conclude that the six-month survival of patients with COPD who required mechanical ventilation for an acute exacerbation of their disease cannot be predicted from simple data generally available to the physician in charge at the time of intubation.\r"

Before surgery, valvular patients had significantly higher elastances and uneven resistances of the respiratory system and lung than those with ischemic heart disease. Postoperatively, the patients presented with an increase in respiratory system and lung elastances, a decrease in pulmonary resistance, and a rise in chest wall resistance.

A solution of hypertonic (7 percent) saline was nebulized. The ultrasonic nebulizer retained a higher \"dead\" volume of solution on completion of nebulization (p less than 0.05), but the increase in saline concentration was less marked than for the jet (p less than 0.01). The mass of NaCl released as aerosol was similar for the ultrasonic and for the jet at 6 L/min but was increased for the jet at 12 L/min (p less than 0.05). There was a fivefold interindividual variation in output for the ultrasonic. Droplet mass median diameters for the ultrasonic (mean 5.4 micron) were slightly lower than those for the jet at 6 L/min (mean 6.0 micron, p less than 0.05) but were higher than those for the jet at 12 L/min (mean 3.7 micron, p less than 0.01).

In group B, four patients were diagnosed greater than 24 h after perforation. Nine were treated surgically; of these one died. Two group B patients who were treated conservatively survived. In group E, only four patients were diagnosed greater than 24 h after perforation. Of 19 patients, 15 were treated surgically and four, medically. In group E, three patients died (one surgically and two conservatively treated). This study suggests that there is little difference in mortality between the two groups of patients as long as the diagnosis is made early and therapy is instituted promptly.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective review, 62 patients treated for rectal cancer by contact (endocavitary) irradiation at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation were analyzed. This treatment modality delivers high dose, low penetration irradiation to a rectal cancer by direct contact of a 50 KV x-ray source through a special proctoscope. Cancers selected for this treatment include small (3 cm or less), mobile tumors without presacral lymphadenopathy that are within reach of digital examination and are well- or moderately well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. Between 1973 and 1984, 62 patients (37 males, 25 females) were treated--46 by contact irradiation alone and 16 by contact irradiation after excisional biopsy. The median tumor dose was 12,000 rads administered in four fractions at monthly intervals. Mean follow-up was 31 months. Fifty-six patients (90 percent) were disease-free at the time of review or death (ten died from unrelated causes). Eleven patients (18 percent) developed local recurrence but eight of these without distant metastases were rendered disease-free by other treatment--six by surgical resection and two by further radiotherapy. Mean time since secondary treatment is 20 months. Three patients are alive with incurable disease and three have died from cancer--in three of these six patients there was no evidence of local disease. Ulcerated tumors developed local recurrence in five of 17 cases (29 percent) while polypoid tumors recurred locally in six cases (14 percent). Morbidity from the treatment was minor in nature. It is suggested that contact (endocavitary) irradiation is effective treatment for carefully selected cases of rectal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Testing for occult blood in stool is used frequently as a screening technique for colorectal carcinomas, but no study has ever shown an improved survival rate for colorectal carcinoma in patients screened by this method. Consequently, the authors have prospectively compared the sensitivity of endoscopy and occult blood testing in finding colorectal neoplasms. During the first year of the Surgical Endoscopy Service, 585 patients underwent sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Seventy-nine patients (13.5 percent) were excluded from the study because their occult blood status was not recorded. Patients averaged 63 + 10 years of age and 98 percent were men. Of the 348 patients with occult blood negative stools 55.5 percent underwent colonoscopy and 44.5 percent underwent sigmoidoscopy. Polyps were found in 25.6 percent of these patients, colorectal carcinomas in 2.6 percent, and diverticulosis 36.2 percent. Of the 158 patients with occult blood positive stool, 76.5 percent underwent colonoscopy and 23.4 percent underwent sigmoidoscopy. Polyps were discovered in 39.0 percent of these patients, colorectal carcinomas in 10.1 percent, and diverticulosis in 43.0 percent. Thus, the occult blood test was negative in 59 percent of patients with polyps and 36 percent with colorectal cancers. These data indicate that lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is superior to occult blood testing in detecting colorectal neoplasms. These results further suggest that using the occult blood test as a screening test for colorectal neoplasms will result in a significant number of these lesions being missed at an early curable stage.\r"

Biofeedback training was used to condition the patients to relax the anal sphincter during the desire to defecate. After two to eight (mean, 4) training sessions, the authors observed simultaneously a normal RAIR amplitude and recovery from constipation for at least six months in 15 children and five females with decreased RAIR amplitude. Nine of the adult females with hypertonia and USW were able to suppress USW but did not recover from constipation. The data suggest that biofeedback training could be useful in some groups of constipated patients.\r"

Three months after treatment by elastic band ligation, anal pressures were again measured in the hemorrhoid group. Anal pressures were significantly higher in the hemorrhoid group before treatment (102 +/- 26.33 mmHg) as compared with the controls (76.75 +/- 19.56 mmHg) (P less than .001). Three months following elastic band ligation there was a small drop in anal pressure (100 +/- 26.84 mmHg) but it remained significantly higher than the control group. There was also a significant correlation between symptoms and level of anal pressures. The results indicate that persons with hemorrhoids have higher anal pressures than controls. Elastic band ligation relieves the symptoms but should not affect the anal sphincter pressure. The fact that the anal pressures remained high after treatment could imply that higher pressures are an etiologic component in the formation of hemorrhoids.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine, in an acute dog model, the optimum configuration of a new continence mechanism consisting of a musculo-serosal window formed between the afferent and efferent loops of small bowel. The following geometric measures were varied: single or double window (efferent and afferent loops, respectively); percent circumference of bowel wall used for the window; and distance between pouch apex and window. Intraluminal pressure against volume infused in standard time was recorded. Four hundred seventy experiments in 47 pouches were conducted. The authors suggest that the optimal configuration for this \"valve\" is bowel circumference used for the window--50 to 60 percent on both the afferent and efferent loops, with a pouch-valve distance of 5 to 6 cm. It is concluded that a biologic valve obviating the need for a nipple may be possible. The geometric configuration has been defined and should be studied in a chronic animal model to determine long-term results.\r"

When combined with the ease of construction of the J-reservoir, this technique of mesenteric lengthening has made the double-loop reservoir the procedure of choice.\r"

Baseline ptO2 levels were lowest on the descending colon (31.8 +/- 7.4 mmHg, mean +/- SD) and tended to increase at all sites with increasing arterial paO2 (r greater than .76, P less than .001). Perianastomotic ptO2 levels were predictive of subsequent anastomotic leakage when they were less than either 20 mmHg; 50 percent of the preresection ptO2; 15 percent of the arterial paO2; or 40 percent of the ptO2 at a control site (ileum).

The clinical activity of the disease, expressed as percentage of patients per year in an active phase, is high in the first year (70.2 percent) and progressively decreases during subsequent years (25 percent after seven years). The percentage of patients who needed steroid treatment is high during the first year (68 percent) and falls to 19 percent after seven years. An operative risk rate of 54 percent was registered, with a probability of reoperation equal to 34 percent. Clinical relapse after the first surgery occurred in 70 percent of cases. The registered mortality was 6.9 percent, with a ratio of 6 to 1 between observed and expected mortality. In conclusion, the disease, while showing a tendency to reduce its activity over the years, is burdened by a risk of surgery and mortality which progressively increases with time.\r"

The results demonstrated successful autotransplantation of colonic tumors in 13 of 21 rats (i.e., 62 percent). In 11 of the 21 rats (52 percent) the tumor grew in the left kidney. Of the various experimental methods proposed for the study of tumor metastases, the one described herein appears to be the first in which primary and secondary tumors were studied in the same individual, since dimethylhydrazine-treated rats usually develop more than one colonic tumor per individual. The model may be useful to monitor the effect of various drugs known to affect tumor growth, not only at the primary site, but also at the site of metastasis.\r"

In July 1983, Indian Health Service personnel initiated a community-based exercise program designed to help control NIDDM in the community. To retrospectively evaluate the effects of the exercise program, the medical records of 30 participants with NIDDM were compared with the medical records of 56 nonparticipants with NIDDM matched by age, sex, health-care provider, and duration of NIDDM. From 1 July 1983 through 1 October 1985, participants had a mean weight loss of 4 kg, whereas nonparticipants had a mean weight loss of 0.9 kg (P less than .05). Participants' fasting blood glucose values dropped by a mean of 43 mg/dl, compared to a mean drop of 2 mg/dl among the nonparticipants (P less than .05). Participants were significantly more likely than nonparticipants to have stopped their hypoglycemic medication (relative risk 4.2) and to have decreased their medication dosage (relative risk 2.2). These results suggest that participation in a community-based exercise program can produce significant weight loss and improvement in glycemic control among a group of Native Americans with NIDDM.\r"

A prospective case-finding study suggested that PEL hypoglycemia occurred in 48 of approximately 300 diabetic type I patients who were diagnosed as diabetic before age 20 yr and who were monitored for up to 2 yr. Typically, hypoglycemia was nocturnal and occurred 6-15 h after the completion of unusually strenuous exercise or play. In more than half the cases the hypoglycemia resulted in loss of consciousness or seizures and necessitated treatment with subcutaneous glucagon or intravenous glucose and/or attendance by a health professional. The hypoglycemia was not limited to patients in good or excellent metabolic control and often occurred after a single bout of exercise in patients unaccustomed to exercise or in athletic patients who were making the transition from an untrained to a trained state. Surprisingly, 12 of the patients who experienced nocturnal PEL hypoglycemia were not using significant amounts of insulin that peaked at night. Type I diabetic patients should be made aware of the possibility of PEL hypoglycemia to enable them to make adjustments in their management plans in anticipation of unusually strenuous exercise, so that they may attempt to minimize or avoid late-onset hypoglycemia.\r"

Maternal glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) concentrations at delivery correlated with the percentile birth-weight ratios (r = .43, P less than .001) and indicated that approximately 18% of variance in the birth weight could be ascribed to glycemic control in the third trimester. Fetal macrosomia occurred in 22 (27%) pregnancies. When 20 of these pregnancies were compared closely with 20 nonmacrosomic pregnancies in diabetic women, the mothers of macrosomic infants were found to be more obese, have a history of previous macrosomic birth, and have higher concentrations of serum human placental lactogen and urinary estriols in the third trimester. Macrosomic pregnancy was further distinguished by accelerated fetal growth (judged by serial ultrasonography) from the 32nd wk of gestation and by biochemical (but asymptomatic) hypoglycemia in the neonate. In our study, no serious neonatal morbidity could be attributed to macrosomic pregnancy. Good glycemic control was attained in both groups, and no significant differences between the groups in overall glycemic control throughout pregnancy were noted. Thus, despite good glycemic control, macrosomia remains comparatively common in modern pregnancy complicated by IDDM, and factors other than maternal hyperglycemia must contribute to its etiology.\r"

These participants were questioned about recent and past use of aspirin. There was no association between the number of aspirin used in the month before the exam and the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Three hundred thirty-eight of these individuals reported taking aspirin daily for at least 3 mo since they were diagnosed as having diabetes. There was no association between the severity of retinopathy and having used aspirin in this way. These analyses suggest that aspirin usage, as herein described, is unrelated to the severity of diabetic retinopathy in older-onset diabetic patients.\r"

In this study, urinary activity of NAG was measured with an interval of 5 yr in 36 insulin-dependent diabetic subjects to evaluate its predictive value for development of diabetic nephropathy. During the observation period, 9 patients developed detectable signs of diabetic nephropathy. In these patients, urinary albumin concentration had increased to 503 +/- 185 mg/L, compared to 16 +/- 1 mg/L in patients without nephropathy (P less than .01; means +/- SE), and the fractional albumin excretion rate was 0.21 +/- 0.07 X 10(-3), compared to 0.01 +/- 0.00 X 10(-3) (P less than .01). However, the activity of urinary NAG was not different in these patients compared with the patients without nephropathy (0.69 +/- 0.15 and 0.61 +/- 0.09 U/mmol creatinine, respectively). Furthermore, no increase in the activity of urinary NAG was seen during the observation period in either group. We concluded that the urinary activity of NAG is not related to the development of microalbuminuria and therefore cannot be used as a predictor for the development of diabetic nephropathy.\r"

Swabs taken from the tongue and buccal mucosa were examined by cytology rather than culture because of the discrimination provided by the former. Cytological smears were classified according to the presence and morphology of the Candida organisms. Overall, a significant difference in Candida species colonization was found between patients with diabetes (75.0%) and controls (35.1%) (P less than .005). In the diabetic group, no relationship was found to recent use of antibiotics, total or differential white blood cell count, serum glucose, presence of diabetic retinopathy, or glycosylated hemoglobin values. We conclude that in IDDM there is a predisposition to oral candidiasis and that this predisposition is independent of glucose control.\r"

The peroneal and posterior tibial motor nerve-conduction velocities were inversely related to height (P less than .05 for both). When age and diabetes duration were included as variables in multiple regression analyses, the associations with height became stronger. Clinical indices of peripheral neuropathy were also related to height in these analyses. Glycosylated hemoglobin was significantly related to thermal sensitivity and the peroneal and posterior tibial motor nerve-conduction velocities but not to vibratory sensitivity. These data indicate that height has a marked influence on quantitative sensory, nerve-conduction, and clinical indices of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\r"

In addition, reanalyses of a laboratory comparison of three reflectance meters (Accucheck II, Glucometer II, Glucoscan 9000) and of two previously published studies comparing the accuracy of five different reflectance meters with EGA is described. EGA provides the practitioner and the researcher with a clinically meaningful method for evaluating the accuracy of blood glucose values generated with various monitoring systems and for analyzing the clinical implications of previously published data.\r"

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is used to measure albumin in the bound and nonbound fractions of an aminophenylboronic acid chromatographic separation. The fingerstick method for assay of glycosylated plasma albumin gives results that are approximately 40% higher than comparable values obtained on the same patient with a 1-ml plasma sample determined with the bromcresol green technique.

Total caloric needs are empirically estimated by calculation of basal energy expenditure and modified by correction factors for concurrent levels of stress. Energy requirements can vary considerably from empiric estimations and may be better defined by indirect calorimetry that measures oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Protein constituents are initiated empirically until patient-specific urea nitrogen excretion is available. The addition of fat emulsion as 20-50 percent of total daily calories limits lipogenesis, prevents excessive carbon dioxide production, and provides a volume-concentrated caloric source to fluid-restricted patients. Manipulation of nutrient composition can improve or impair ventilatory weaning and nutritional rehabilitation. The significance of substrate utilization is reviewed and recommendations for establishing nutritional regimens for mechanically ventilated adults with acute respiratory failure are provided.\r"

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) remains as the most commonly encountered infection in AIDS and an early cause of morbidity and mortality. Current therapy for PCP revolves around the administration of either pentamidine isoethionate or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; however, the major AIDS centers report a high incidence of adverse drug reactions to these drugs. We describe an association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a hemophiliac with multiple drug-related hypersensitivity reactions, which include constitutional, dermatologic, and pulmonary manifestations. This observance is intriguing and suggests that the presence of HIV infection may predispose a patient treated with a multitude of drugs and medications to a higher incidence of adverse reactions.\r"

Severity of side effects, and their resistance to bethanechol and to phenoxybenzamine, necessitated a complete withdrawal of clomipramine. This case demonstrates that clomipramine-induced urinary retention is not limited to older individuals. Possible involvement of noncholinergic and nonadrenergic mechanisms in this adverse drug reaction is suggested.\r"

After failure with conventional antibiotics, ciprofloxacin was initiated because of favorable sensitivity and the planned avoidance of aminoglycoside therapy. Seventy-two hours after initiation of ciprofloxacin, the patient's theophylline level rose from a steady-state baseline of 9.8 micrograms/ml to 34.7 micrograms/ml. After the theophylline dose was reduced by approximately 67 percent, the patient's theophylline serum concentration returned to baseline (10 micrograms/ml). Until more data concerning the interaction of theophylline and ciprofloxacin are available, we recommend close monitoring of theophylline serum concentrations in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin.\r"

Our patient was a 33-year-old male with Marfan's syndrome who was given rifampin 600 mg/d po along with intravenous vancomycin for the treatment of Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis. His platelet count dropped from a baseline of 519,000/mm3 to 4000/mm3 after four doses of rifampin. Petechiae were present on the lower extremities without the presence of other bleeding sites. Rifampin, low-dose aspirin, and dipyridamole were discontinued. His platelet count returned to normal nine days after discontinuation of therapy. With the increasing use of rifampin for the treatment of nontuberculosis infections, clinicians should recognize the possibility of this drug causing such serious immunological reactions as thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, and shock with daily or intermittent therapy.\r"

Criteria were based on clinical situations that do not permit oral therapy, result in questionable dry absorption, or require a more rapid onset of action. The parenteral route was assessed as appropriate, inappropriate, or questionable. During two months, parenteral therapy was prescribed for 199 adult inpatients. Initially, 63 percent received the parenteral form appropriately; only 16 percent continued to receive the parenteral form appropriately throughout therapy. Less than half of the parenteral doses were determined to be appropriate. A major reason appears to be that orders are not changed as patients' conditions improve. Excess medication costs attributed to inappropriate parenteral therapy for the study period amounted to $6796 or $8002, depending on whether questionable doses were considered appropriate or inappropriate, respectively. An annual projected savings of $40,776 or $48,012 could be achieved if oral doses had been administered in place of inappropriate parenteral therapy.\r"

Population included patients (n = 512) and physicians (n = 35) of three internal medicine clinics during an eight-week period. The first four weeks were the preintervention period. The second four weeks were the intervention period in which a clinical pharmacist attended one clinic (A) and provided drug profiles on all patients. Two other clinics (B and C) served as controls. During the intervention, patients in clinic A experienced a significant reduction in prescribing problems as identified by the pharmacist: 49 percent of patients before the intervention versus 9.4 percent after the intervention (p less than 0.001). Patients in clinic B had no significant change in prevalence in the number of problems identified (39 versus 40 percent; NS), and patients in clinic C had a significant but less dramatic decrease (35 versus 22 percent; p less than 0.05). The proportion of patients in clinic A with net decrease in the number of prescribed medications rose from 7.1 to 34.9 percent (p less than 0.001), with a mean decrease of 0.3 medications per patient. No significant differences in number of prescribed medications were noted in clinics B or C. Accuracy of physician medication charting improved for patients in clinic A from 54 percent of charts with accurate drug lists before the intervention to 78.3 percent after the intervention (p less than 0.001). No significant improvements were noted for clinics B and C. These results suggest that computerized drug profiles together with clinical pharmacist consultation can improve prescribing practices in a hospital outpatient department.\r"

Data for a four-year period were collected on patients at an outpatient clinic's pharmacokinetic consultation service. The study group included 50 adults and children with at least one SPC taken at a known time after dose administration. Input variables were weight, sex, height, age, concomitant drugs and diseases, phenobarbital dosage regimen, and the time and reported value of all SPC. Initially, SIMKIN (SIMulated KINetics) simulated dosing regimens on the basis of literature estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters; SPC were then estimated for these regimens and compared with actual values. One or two additional SPC were added to the input data and analyzed, and the predicted SPC compared with actual values. Although SIMKIN's accuracy and bias as measured by regression analysis and mean prediction error, respectively, were within clinically acceptable limits, the precision was not. However, these results are limited by the population studied. Patient compliance, concomitant phenytoin therapy, changes in phenobarbital pharmacokinetic parameters with chronic dosing, and disease interactions may significantly affect predictive ability. The clinical effects of these factors need to be evaluated to further improve predictions.\r"

Although a number of systems have evolved to perform postmarketing surveillance, each has important limitations, suggesting the need for an alternative, innovative approach that would permit rapid identification of potential problems and support studies of multiple drugs and/or disease states in patient populations large enough to permit identification of uncommon, but significant adverse drug reactions. This has led to the organization of a nationwide network of clinical pharmacists with an active role in patient-care monitoring to collect information regarding the safety and effectiveness of drugs. At the present time there are 383 clinical pharmacists from all 50 states participating in the network. These individuals collectively monitor more than 150,000 inpatient hospital beds, more than 40,000 nursing home beds, and more than 800,000 ambulatory care visits per year. Participating clinical pharmacists, using standardized data collection forms, perform concurrent monitoring of drug-therapy outcome in targeted patient populations. Careful analysis and interpretation of this information will yield clinically relevant information regarding the outcome of drug therapy under actual clinical conditions.\r"

In order to assess the utility of this network a pilot project was performed to obtain a cross-sectional view of antibiotic utilization in the U.S. and to identify potential problems with a more widespread implementation of this program. One hundred eleven pharmacists enrolled in the drug surveillance network participated in this survey and collected information on more than 2000 patients treated with antimicrobial agents over approximately a three-month period (February-April 1987). The most common sites of infection were the lung, genitourinary tract, skin and soft tissue, and the abdomen, and accounted for approximately 75 percent of infections. Overall, the aminoglycosides, the first-generation cephalosporins, and the aminopenicillins remain the most commonly used antibiotics and represent approximately 50 percent of antimicrobials used in the surveyed population. The results of this pilot project suggest that the use of a nationwide network of clinical pharmacists is a promising source of clinically relevant drug experience data. The ability to concurrently evaluate patients and link information regarding patient demographics, drug therapy regimens, diagnosis, and clinical outcomes fills an important gap in our knowledge of clinical drug utilization.\r"

Although the more specific of these definitions is required for scientific evaluation of the link between drug and event, other less stringent definitions are usually adequate for clinical purposes. Knowledge about the safety profile of a drug in humans is limited at the time of marketing. The mechanisms for supplementing safety data during postmarketing include (1) the Spontaneous Reporting System maintained by the Food and Drug Administration, (2) formal projects to assemble safety data on larger or more complex populations, and (3) formal projects designed to answer specific research questions. Judgments about attribution can be no better than the data that support them. The criteria applied by the clinician to the individual adverse drug experience to determine association differ from those required to establish causation based on epidemiologic evidence. In most situations, regulatory action on drug recall should be based on epidemiologic evidence. This article will discuss the choice of a definition for an adverse drug event, examine the extent and nature of the safety data assembled on a drug at the time it is marketed, propose the best methods for collecting additional information after marketing, and designate factors to be considered in judging a drug to be causally related to an adverse event.\r"

Maximum stimulation, relative to corresponding controls, was seen at 0.2% serum (2- to 3-fold), and no stimulation was seen in the absence of serum or under serum replete conditions. The effect was dose-dependent with an ED50 of around 750 pg/ml (47 pM). aFGF (5 ng/ml) sustained the growth of calvaria cells in culture during multiple passages (72 days) at 0.2% serum. In DNA synthesis assays aFGF produced 2- to 4-fold stimulation; insulin-like growth factor I had a slight effect on DNA synthesis on its own, but enhanced the effect of aFGF 2-fold. In cells fully stimulated by epidermal growth factor (5-fold), aFGF had no further effect. Stimulation of DNA synthesis peaked at 5 ng/ml, while higher concentrations were inhibitory. Recombinant aFGF (bovine sequence) also stimulated cell proliferation (1.5-fold), and its potency was augmented by heparin (50 micrograms/ml), about 2-fold. Using simultaneous histochemical staining for alkaline phosphatase activity and [3H]thymidine nuclear uptake we found that aFGF stimulates DNA synthesis to the same extent in alkaline phosphatase-rich (osteoblastic) and alkaline phosphatase-poor (nonosteoblastic) cells. However, after cell division there is a significant decrease in PTH-responsive adenylate cyclase (2- to 3-fold) and in alkaline phosphatase levels (4- to 8-fold). These findings indicate that aFGF is mitogenic to rat calvaria osteoblastic cells, its action requires additional factors, and its growth stimulation is associated with a reduction in phenotypic expression.\r"

Comparison of cross-sectional growth allometries of organ weights and external body dimensions between the two samples was based on analyses of covariance. We report significantly increased growth in all of the organs and measurements examined except for the brain. Coefficients of growth allometry differ significantly from isometric values in a number of cases, and thus, the adult transgenic mice exhibit body proportions different from those of the adult controls. Most of these shape differences reflect general allometric size increase, but the liver and spleen of the transgenics undergo special enlargement or growth. These results indicate that the primary effect of elevated GH and IGF-I levels is increased overall growth, but in the relative proportions set by the intrinsic controls of individual organs and body regions.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the enhancing effects of 1,2-dehydrotestololactone (delta 1-testololactone) on the hypertensinogenic action of 19-hydroxyandrostenedione (19-OH-A-dione), 1 mg 19-OH-A-dione, 10 mg delta 1-testololactone, or a combination of 1 mg 19-OH-A-dione and 10 mg delta 1-testololactone was injected into intact rats drinking water once a week for 4 weeks. The blood pressure of control rats and rats given 19-OH-A-dione, delta 1-testololactone, and a combination of 19-OH-A-dione and delta 1-testololactone in the fourth week was 130 +/- 2 (SE), 140 +/- 2, 128 +/- 6, and 152 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively. The blood pressure of rats given 19-OH-A-dione and a combination of 19-OH-A-dione and delta 1-testololactone was significantly higher than that of control rats. In addition, the blood pressure of rats given a combination of 19-OH-A-dione and delta 1-testololactone was significantly higher than that of rats given 19-OH-A-dione alone. As delta 1-testololactone itself did not show any hypertensinogenic action, it is considered to enhance the hypertensinogenic action of 19-OH-A-dione. Although plasma 19-OH-A-dione concentrations of control rats and rats given delta 1-testololactone were lower than the sensitivity of RIA, those of rats given 19-OH-A-dione and a combination of 19-OH-A-dione and delta 1-testololactone were 116 +/- 3 and 222 +/- 37 pg/ml, respectively. Plasma 19-OH-A-dione concentrations of rats given a combination of 19-OH-A-dione and delta 1-testololactone were significantly higher than those of rats given 19-OH-A-dione alone. Therefore, delta 1-testololactone is considered to enhance the action of 19-OH-A-dione by increasing plasma concentrations of 19-OH-A-dione. As delta 1-testololactone is an aromatase inhibitor, the inhibition of the conversion of circulating 19-OH-A-dione to estrogens in peripheral tissues might be the cause of the elevation of plasma 19-OH-A-dione concentrations. These results indicate that aromatose inhibitors enhance the hypertensinogenic action of 19-OH-A-dione by decreasing the degradation of 19-OH-A-dione.\r"

T4 was not deiodinated at either concentration. Reduced Thd was effective at physiological concentrations in stimulating microsomal rT3 deiodination (EC50, approximately 15 microM); Thd-supported microsomal deiodination showed a maximum velocity approximately one third that in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT), and Thd-supported deiodination, compared to that with DTT, was 10- and 2000-fold more sensitive to inhibition by propylthiouracil and iopanoate, respectively, than was the DTT-supported reaction. The Michaelis constants for rT3 (2.5 nM) were identical for the Thd- and DTT-activated reactions, suggesting that these thiols stimulated deiodination by the same enzyme. Arrhenius plots also revealed comparable activation energies for Thd- and DTT-mediated low Km rT3 monodeiodination; these activation energies were, moreover, distinct from those observed with the low Km T4 deiodination in the presence of DTT. The data suggest that renal and hepatic microsomes contain separate low Km rT3-specific and T4-specific 5'-monodeiodinases and that the rT3-specific monodeiodinase can use the reducing potential of NADPH, via the Thd system. Such an enzyme could mediate the disposal of rT3, the noncalorigenic metabolite of T4, independently of the conversion of T4 to T3.\r"

  ".W": "Intraventricular injection of neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates LH release in estradiol benzoate- and progesterone-primed (EBP) ovariectomized rats. Because adrenergic neurotransmitters, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), show intraneuronal coexistence with NPY in certain brain regions of the rat and there are similarities in the effects of NPY and NE/E on LH release, we investigated the possible interaction of NPY and adrenergic receptor systems in the stimulation of LH release in EBP-treated ovariectomized rats. The experiments were designed to determine whether NPY exerted its effects via adrenergic receptors and whether combined administrations of NPY and NE can act synergistically or in an additive manner to enhance the LH release response. Permanent stainless steel cannulae were placed in the third ventricle of the brain, and the rats were ovariectomized. Two weeks after surgery, rats were injected with EB (30 micrograms/rat) and P (15 mg/rat). Two days later, the effects of either vehicle alone (control) or various adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor antagonists and an opiate receptor agonist on stimulation of LH release by NPY were assessed. Intraventricular injection of 0.47 nmol NPY increased plasma LH levels at 10, 20, and 30 min in control rats. The NPY-induced LH response was not blocked by pretreatment with any of the following drugs: the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine, the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol, the dopamine receptor antagonist pimozide, or the opiate receptor agonist morphine. All of these drugs affect LH release in other circumstances. On the other hand, the alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine significantly attenuated the NPY-induced LH increments. In the second study dealing with the possible synergistic or additive interactions between NPY and NE, we observed that when doses of NPY and NE that separately were only minimally effective in stimulating LH release were administered together, the amounts of LH secreted were greater than the sum of the individual responses. However, when NE and NPY were given together in doses that alone had either no stimulatory or maximal stimulatory effects, there were no additive or synergistic effects on LH release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Incubation of fetal sheep serum with [125I]oIGF-II, followed by chromatography on Fractogel TSK HW55(S), revealed the presence of two major binding protein species, a lower molecular weight binding protein (apparent mol wt approximately 60,000) and a much higher molecular weight binding protein (apparent mol wt approximately 500,000). Only the lower molecular weight binding protein complex was seen in serum from adult nonpregnant sheep. The lower molecular weight binding protein in fetal and adult sheep serum bound both [125I]oIGF-II and [125I]hIGF-I, both of which could be displaced by unlabeled oIGF-II or hIGF-I. However, the very high molecular weight binding protein bound only [125I]oIGF-II, and this could only be displaced by unlabeled oIGF-II. The very high molecular weight binding protein appears to bind approximately 40% of the endogenous oIGF-II. We have purified the very high molecular weight binding protein from fetal sheep serum using anion exchange, Concanavalin A Sepharose, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The purified binding protein preparation did not contain any lower molecular weight binding protein and did not bind [125I]hIGF-I. In addition, this binding protein was stable at pH 3.2 for 1 h. Thus, fetal sheep serum contains a very high molecular weight IGF binding glycoprotein that is acid stable and specific for IGF-II.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated rat calvaria cells plated at low density in medium supplemented with ascorbic acid and organic phosphate form discrete three-dimensional mineralized nodules having the characteristics of bone. We have studied the effects of glucocorticoids on the formation of bone nodules by these cell populations. Cells isolated from 21-day-old fetal rat calvaria were maintained in vitro for up to 27 days. Dexamethasone (Dex) induced a dose-related increase in the number of nodules formed, with a peak at 10 nM and a half-maximal response at about 1 nM. Dex (10 nM) also significantly increased the size of bone nodules formed (P less than 0.002). High concentrations of Dex (1 microM) did not increase nodule number. In cells in primary culture maintained in medium containing 10 nM Dex, the increase in nodule number was 50-100% over the control value. The effect of Dex was much greater in first subculture cells, where the number of nodules was 600-800% higher than the control value. Dishes collected and quantitated from 12-27 days showed that nodule formation ceased between 15 and 18 days in cultures without Dex, whereas in the presence of Dex the number of nodules increased up to 27 days. Addition of 10 nM Dex only during specific periods resulted in significantly more nodules than in control cultures, but significantly fewer nodules than in cultures constantly exposed to Dex. Cell population doubling times during log phase growth were unaltered, but a significant increase in saturation density (P less than 0.001) was observed with 10 nM Dex. Hydrocortisone also caused an increase in the number of nodules formed, with a maximal effect of 50 nM and a half-maximal response at 8 nM. The results indicate that physiological levels of glucocorticoids stimulate bone nodule formation in long term cell culture by increasing the number of cells forming bone nodules and that maximization of the stimulatory effect of glucocorticoids on bone formation may require constant exposure to low levels of the hormone.\r"

  ".W": "The model of the serum PRL surge generated in the ovariectomized rat after estradiol benzoate (EB) treatment was used to study the relationship between serum and pituitary PRL levels and pituitary PRL mRNA levels. Adult ovariectomized rats were injected sc with 7 micrograms EB or vehicle at noon on day 0. Three days later (day 3), the rats were decapitated every 4 h over a 24-h period (0800 h on day 3 to 0400 h on day 4) for determination of serum and pituitary PRL and GH levels by RIA. In addition, PRL and GH mRNA content was determined using dot blot hybridization with cDNAs. Administration of EB resulted in a significant rise in serum PRL levels at 1200, 1600, and 2000 h on day 3 compared to control values. At other times, serum PRL levels in the EB group were the same as control values. EB treatment also elicited a marked increase in pituitary PRL content at all time periods examined except during (1600 and 2000 h) and after the PRL surge (2400 h on day 3) when there was a significant reduction in stored pituitary PRL. The pituitary PRL mRNA content in the EB-treated group was significantly elevated (4- to 6-fold) over control levels throughout the study. Furthermore, PRL mRNA levels in EB-treated rats were significantly higher at 2000 and 2400 h on day 3 than at other time periods. In contrast to its effects on PRL, EB treatment had a slight inhibitory effect on pituitary GH content at 2000 and 2400 h on day 3 compared to control values; otherwise, this steroid had no effect on serum GH levels and pituitary GH mRNA content. Interestingly, serum GH levels and pituitary GH mRNA content in both treatment and control groups fluctuated in a pattern consistent with circadian rhythms, with peak values occurring during the lights-on hours. These data show that estrogen has a stimulatory effect on pituitary content of PRL and its corresponding mRNA in the rat 3 days after injection. These elevated PRL mRNa levels may be necessary for the occurrence of PRL surges. Furthermore, the facts that serum PRL levels were elevated only at certain times (1200-2000 h on day 3) while PRL mRNA content was increased at all times in the EB-treated rats suggest a differential regulation between PRL release and biosynthesis.\r"

We, therefore, studied the mechanism of IGF-I action on the somatotroph with or without cAMP activators. Primary rat pituitary cells growing in serum-free medium were treated with IGF-I. GH secretion was measured by RIA, and mRNA levels were measured by hybridization to [32P]GH cDNA. 8-Bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP; 0.625 mM) stimulated GH mRNA levels after 72 h by 238%. IGF-I (6.5 nM) caused a 64% inhibition of 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated GH mRNA levels and a similar inhibition of GH secretion. This inhibition was time and dose dependent, with maximal (71%) suppression of cAMP-induced GH achieved with 13 nM IGF-I after 72 h. Forskolin (1 microM), a stimulator of adenylate cyclase, stimulated GH secretion (198%) which was inhibited by IGF-I by 42%. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, (a phorbol ester; 50 nM), a potent activator of protein kinase C, strongly stimulated GH secretion (347%), which was similarly suppressed by IGF-I by 51%. The suppressive action of IGF-I on somatotroph gene expression is unimpaired by direct activation of both cAMP and protein kinase C, suggesting that IGF-I acts upon the GH gene by a mechanism that is not altered by these second messengers. The negative feedback inhibition of physiological concentrations of IGF-I on GH, therefore, appears to override the potent stimulation of GH by these intracellular messengers.\r"

We identified the PRL synthesized in endometrial stromal cells and investigated the effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), estradiol (E2), porcine relaxin (RLX), and RU486, an antiprogestin, on PRL production by stromal cells from non-pregnant endometrium in primary culture. Stromal cells were isolated from proliferative and secretory endometria and individually cultured in nutrient medium or medium supplemented with different hormone(s). The immunoreactive PRL isolated from culture medium of hormone-stimulated stromal cells was identified and compared to pituitary PRL. Bio-Gel elution pattern and mol wt analysis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting showed that PRL produced by stromal cells had properties identical to those of pituitary PRL. In addition, PRL mRNA was identified in hormone-stimulated stromal cells using human pituitary PRL cDNA as a hybridization probe. Analysis of mRNA by Northern blotting showed that the size of PRL mRNA isolated from stromal cells was indistinguishable from that of PRL mRNA in human decidua and pituitary tissue. These results indicated that PRL measured in culture medium was synthesized de novo by stromal cells. The PRL content in culture medium was quantitated by RIA. The PRL production rate in stromal cells cultured without hormones ranged from 6-10 ng/day.mg cell protein. After 4-5 days of incubation with RLX or MPA alone, the PRL production rate increased about 2- to 3-fold over the control value. E2 alone had either no effect or slightly decreased the stromal cell PRL production rate. Stromal cells responded to 0.02 microM MPA, and the maximal response was at 0.1-1 microM MPA. A further increase in PRL production was found when stromal cells were treated with a combination of MPA and E2 and MPA, E2 and RLX. In the presence of MPA or MPA and E2, 0.1 ng/ml relaxin increased the PRL production rate. A potent progestin antagonist, RU486, inhibited PRL production in stromal cells treated with MPA, MPA and E2, or MPA and RLX. These results indicate that endometrial PRL production is regulated by the combined effects of steroid hormones (progestin and estrogen) and a peptide hormone (relaxin).\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that nuclear thyroid hormone receptors in rat brain are preferentially localized within neurons. These cells also synthesize protein at a high rate, and the aim of the present study was to investigate any relationship between these two characteristics. In this paper we have shown that T3 stimulates leucine uptake and incorporation into protein in primary cell cultures of neurons. Stimulation was apparent with concentrations of hormone as low as 1.25 nM and increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 10 nM T3. However, the rapidity of the effect (evident at 25 min, and significant at 40 min) suggests that protein synthesis is stimulated at the level of translation, rather than transcription. More detailed study with 5 nM T3, revealed that incorporation into both soluble (cytoplasmic) and insoluble (membrane-associated) protein fractions was stimulated to similar degrees, and therefore the effect on protein synthesis was general. Furthermore, T3-mediated stimulation of leucine uptake into neurons was completely abolished in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitors, actinomycin D and cycloheximide, and therefore the effect on leucine uptake was attributed to an increased requirement for the amino acid in protein synthesis (pleiotrophic effect). Parallel studies conducted with synaptosomes and mitochondria isolated from the central nervous system of adult euthyroid animals revealed that 5 nM T3 was without effect on leucine uptake and incorporation into protein. Possible reasons for this lack of effect are discussed.\r"

In addition to its well documented immunopotentiating effects, TF5 reportedly modulates the secretion of some hypothalamic peptides and pituitary hormones. In this study, TF5 (10-100 micrograms/ml) stimulated PRL release from normal, MtTW15, and 7315a cells and GH release from normal and MtTW15 cells, but had no apparent effect on LH release. No changes in intracellular cAMP or cGMP levels could be correlated with these responses. Stimulation of PRL release from perifused normal anterior pituitary cells was rapid, sustained, and concentration related. Although it had no apparent effect on normal prelabeled anterior pituitary cells with respect to 45Ca2+ efflux, the calcium channel blocker D-600 inhibited TF5-mediated hormone release from these cells. Additive increases in TRH-stimulated PRL release and GRF-stimulated GH release by TF5 suggested independent mechanisms of action. Dopamine (500 nM) blocked TF5-stimulated PRL release, but somatostatin (10-100 nM) had no effect on TF5-stimulated PRL or GH release. TF5 failed to affect either basal or TRH-induced polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis. Perifused normal anterior pituitary cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonate responded to TF5 treatment with a liberation of radioactive arachidonate and/or its metabolites. BW755c, an inhibitor of all known catabolic pathways of arachidonic acid, blocked the ability of TF5 to stimulate PRL and GH release. Reversed phase HPLC separation of TF5 into five fractions resulted in two fractions that exhibited hormone-releasing activity. These data suggest that TF5 stimulates pituitary hormone release through a mechanism different from that ascribed to TRH or GRF. The stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism involves neither polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis nor cAMP generation, but appears to be dependent on the generation of arachidonate metabolites.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about tissue differences in estrogen receptor (ER) dynamics, despite evidence that they could play a role in the tissue specificity of estrogen action. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that ER dynamics differ in uterus (UT), pituitary (PIT), and hypothalamus (HYPO), as measured by 1) duration of peak nuclear ER (ERn), 2) rate of replenishment of cytosolic ER (ERc), and 3) loss of total ER (ERt) after a bolus of estradiol (E2). Young adult mice were studied at two hormonally distinct stages of the cycle [days 2 or 3 (D2-3) and D5 (D1 = proestrus)]. Animals were injected with a dose of E2 (0.05 microgram/10 g BW) sufficient to achieve maximal ERn or with vehicle only, and ER was determined in nuclear and cytosolic fractions 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h later. ERn peaked concomitantly with plasma E2 at 1 h in all tissues, but the duration of peak ERn varied among tissues: 4 h in HYPO compared to 1-2 h in UT and PIT. ERc replenishment was complete by 12 h in HYPO, but not until 24 h or more in PIT; replenishment in UT was intermediate (12-24 h). The transient loss of ERt after E2 injection was pronounced in UT and PIT, but was undetectable in HYPO. These tissue differences were maintained across cycle state, despite effects of cycle state on ER dynamics. The effects of cycle state on ER dynamics were also tissue specific; they were greatest in UT and absent in HYPO. On D2-3 in UT, ERn and ERt were lower, and replenishment of ERc was slower than on D5. Parallel effects of cycle state were seen in PIT, with the exception of ERn, which was unaffected. Because altered ER dynamics similar to those observed on D2-3 can be produced by progesterone pretreatment, the altered ER dynamics on D2-3 may be a consequence of recent exposure on D1 to the ovulatory surge of progesterone. Taken together, these results indicate that the mechanisms governing intracellular ER dynamics vary markedly among tissues and provide an impetus for further examination of their role in the tissue specificity of estrogen action.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse uterine estrogen receptor (ER) was purified about 11,000-fold from normal mouse uteri by affinity chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified ER demonstrated a major component of 65,000 mol wt with minor fragments of the 54,000- and 37,000-dalton species, as judged by affinity labeling with [3H]tamoxifen aziridine and immunodetection with an ER monoclonal antibody (H-222). The minor fragments were not detected with additional monoclonals (H-226 or D-547), which recognize different domains on the ER molecule. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the major component with a mol wt of 65,000 had a pI of about 6.5. The 54,000- and 37,000-dalton components had similar pI values. Saturation binding and Scatchard plot analysis of purified ER yielded one class of binding sites with an apparent dissociation constant of about 1.4 nM. Changes in the hormonal status resulted in changes in the size of the ER even in the presence of molybdate and leupeptin.\r"

  ".W": "Radioiodinated TSH was covalently cross-linked to monolayers of FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells using the homobifunctional cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate. Analysis of the cross-linked samples by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions demonstrated the presence of three specifically labeled complexes with apparent mol wt of 68,000, 85,000, and 145,000, in addition to the TSH alpha-beta dimer and its alpha- and beta-subunits. When bound [125I]iodo-TSH was cross-linked with increasing concentrations of disuccinimidyl suberate, the formation of the 68,000 and 85,000 mol wt complexes was sequential, with the 68,000 complex appearing first. These two complexes were also observed after labeling with radioiodinated TSH hybrid molecules (alpha-beta or alpha-beta), in which the label is in only one subunit, or immuno-precipitation with antibodies against either the alpha- or beta-subunit of TSH. Similar complexes (65,000, 82,000, and 145,000 mol wt) were also formed after cross-linking with the alkaline-cleavable cross-linker (bis-[2-(succinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone. Again, the appearance of these three complexes was sequential and dependent on the cross-linker concentration. At low concentrations and under reducing conditions, the 65,000 mol wt complex was the major band. However, at high concentrations, especially under nonreducing conditions, most of the radioactivity was present in the 145,000 mol wt complex. Alkaline cleavage of these three complexes followed by electrophoresis in a second dimension resulted in the release of three components with approximate mol wt of 31,000, 17,000, and 63,000 in addition to the TSH alpha-beta dimer and its alpha- and beta-subunits. Reduction by dithiothreitol followed by electrophoresis in a second dimension resulted in the release of only the 17,000 and 63,000 components. Taken together, these results suggest that 1) both the 65,000 and 82,000 complexes are formed after incremental cross-linking of TSH alpha-beta dimer to receptor subunits; and 2) the TSH receptor may be an oligomer composed of three different subunits, 31,000, 17,000, and 63,000, of which only the 31,000 subunit binds TSH.\r"

  ".U": "88054838\r", 
  ".W": "Thyroid enlargement in response to chronic hypersecretion of TSH reflects the coordinated growth of both parenchyma and stroma. Because Wollman et al. observed in propylthiouracil-fed rats that enlargement and remodeling of thyroid capillaries were strictly localized around follicles, they hypothesized that growth of perifollicular blood vessels is stimulated by angiogenic factors secreted by neighboring follicular epithelial cells. In support of this hypothesis, we report that media conditioned by rat thyroid cells were very active in an in vitro angiogenesis bioassay that measures stimulation of endothelial cell migration through chemotaxis membranes in microwell Boyden chamber assemblies. Primary cultures of thyroid cells from collagenase-dispersed glands from male or female Holtzman rats fed 0.01% propylthiouracil in the drinking water released activity that produced up to 5-fold increases in endothelial cell migration rates relative to those in identical unconditioned medium. Thyroid-derived activity was primarily chemotactic (i.e. only weakly chemokinetic) to both rabbit aortic and microvascular endothelial cells. That endotheliotropic activity is derived from thyroid parenchyma is indicated by the finding that media conditioned by FRTL cells, a clonally derived thyroid follicular epithelial cell line, produced parallel chemoattractant responses. Thyroid-conditioned media were also chemoattractant to mouse BALB/c-3T3 cells, which have endothelial cell characteristics. In contrast, thyroid-conditioned media did not increase the high spontaneous migration rate of Walker rat sarcoma (WR256) cells. T4, T3, thyroglobulin, bovine fibroblast growth factor (alpha and beta), and media conditioned by rabbit endothelial cells were inactive. Chemoattractant activity in serum containing conditioned media was retained by both 10,000 and 30,000 mol wt cut-off (MWCO) ultrafilters. Activity in serum-free thyroid-conditioned media was largely retained by 10,000 MWCO filters, but only partially retained by 30,000 MWCO filters; activity in the 30,000 filtrate was recoverable in a 10,000 MWCO retentate. These findings support the hypothesis that capillary growth during thyroid enlargement occurs, at least in part, as a result of a parenchymal-stromal (epithelial-mesenchymal) paracrine interaction mediated by specific endotheliotropic (angiogenic) factors released by follicular epithelial cells and distinct from T3, T4, and thyroglobulin.\r"

IGF-I mRNA can be detected as early as day 11 of embryonic development and rises 8.6-fold over the ensuing 48 h. By contrast IGF-II mRNA is relatively constant over days 11-14 of gestation.

  ".W": "Since in skeletal muscle circulating L-T3 is the only source for the hormone bound to nuclei, we investigated the intracellular and intranuclear transport of L-T3 in L6E9 rat skeletal muscle cells. The characteristics of this process were assessed by analyzing the nuclear bound L-T3 as a marker of the internalized hormone and by determining the initial rate of L-T3 uptake. [125I]L-T3 cellular uptake at 37 C reached a plateau at 2 h when the nuclear uptake, after an initial lag phase, was still increasing and represented 4.7% of the cellular uptake. Incubation at 4 C caused [125I]L-T3 cellular uptake to decrease by 77% and nuclear uptake to be abolished. A similar effect on [125I]L-T3 nuclear uptake was obtained after myoblasts were incubated at 37 C with a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled L-T3. The addition of various inhibitors of ATP production, cytoskeleton integrity, endocytosis, and Na+, K+-ATPase that did not interfere with [125I]L-T3 binding to the cell surface or to isolated nuclei caused a dose-dependent reduction of both extranuclear and nuclear uptake, ranging from 34-85%. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence on the myoblast surface of L-T3 high affinity (Ka = 1.6 X 10(9) M-1) and low affinity (Ka = 5.4 X 10(6) M-1) binding sites; other iodothyronines exhibited lower affinity for both sites. Kinetic analysis of L-T3 transport after 60-sec incubation at 23 C defined a process with a Km of 17 +/- 5.6 nM and a maximum velocity of 83 +/- 35 pmol/mg DNA. These results indicate the existence in rat myoblasts of a temperature-dependent, energy-requiring, saturable, and stereospecific L-T3 uptake mechanism, probably mediated through an endocytotic pathway, located on the myoblast plasma membrane, that may regulate L-T3 action in skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The early development of the mouse bulbourethral gland (BUG) and the role of testosterone (T) in the normal growth and epithelial morphogenesis of this male accessory sex gland were examined. The mouse BUG differentiates from the urogenital sinus on day 17 of gestation (vaginal plug = day 0; birth = day 19), and initially consists of a solid epithelial rudiment encased in a large condensed capsular mesenchyme. The epithelium begins to branch and canalize on day 1 postnatally, and the branches enlarge and become more numerous on days 2 and 3. On day 4, secondary branches appear, and by day 6, the epithelium has become extensively arborized and almost fills the mesenchymal capsule. The BUG increases 3.9-fold in DNA content from day 0 (day of birth) to day 6 postnatally; the epithelium grows proportionately more than the mesenchyme during this period (12-fold vs. 2.3-fold). Growth of BUGs in mice castrated at birth or castrated and then treated with cyproterone acetate, an antiandrogen, over the first 6 days of life was reduced by 80%, but not abolished. Thus, the growth of the BUG is partially independent of androgens during early neonatal life. However, morphogenesis of the BUG epithelium is totally abolished in neonatally castrated mice. T replacement given to neonatally castrated mice during days 0-6 restored development to normal. T injections also reinitiated growth and morphogenesis in developmentally retarded BUGs from 6-day-old neonatally castrated mice. The partial dependence of the neonatal BUG on androgens for growth is similar to that seen in the prostate, which is also derived from the urogenital sinus. In contrast to the prostate, where neonatal castration reduces but does not abolish epithelial morphogenesis, androgen deprivation completely abolished epithelial morphogenesis in the neonatal BUG.

  ".W": "An organ culture system was devised for neonatal mouse bulbourethral glands (BUGs) in which androgen-dependent development parallels that in vivo. BUGs from 0-day-old (day of birth) mice were grown on Millipore filters placed on metal grids in petri dishes for 3 or 6 days in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium-Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. In medium supplemented with testosterone (T; 10(-7) or 10(-8) M), growth and epithelial morphogenesis of the cultured BUGs were comparable to those of the gland in situ. At lower doses of T (10(-9) -10(-12) M), BUGs showed dose-dependent decreases in the rate of growth and degree of epithelial morphogenesis. BUGs cultured without T contained only 38% as much DNA as those in T-supplemented medium, and epithelial morphogenesis did not occur. Thus, BUG development in vitro was dependent on androgens. The continued, albeit reduced, growth in cultures without T indicates that growth is also partially independent of androgens, but epithelial branching morphogenesis is totally dependent on this hormone. Growth and epithelial morphogenesis were reinitiated in glands that had developed in the absence of T, either in vivo or in vitro, by culturing the BUGs for 3 days in T-containing medium. The growth of BUGs in a serum-free medium with or without T paralleled that in comparable serum-containing cultures in vitro and in normal and castrated animals in situ. Coincubation of BUGs with T and 390 MSD (17 beta-N,N-diisopropylcarbamoyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one), an inhibitor of the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase, resulted in retarded development, indicating that T must be converted to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to promote normal BUG growth. Additionally, DHT (10(-8) M) alone could substitute for T in promoting BUG development. Thus, DHT must be the proximal androgen for BUG growth. The BUG is an excellent model system for examining androgen-dependent development and should be useful for studying epithelial morphogenesis, growth, and hormonal effects in vitro.\r"

We also checked the abilities of the analogs to displace [125I]N-Tyr-SRIF binding to pituitary cell membranes and their potency to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. There was a very good correlation (r = 0.975) between the displacement of [125I]N-Tyr-SRIF and the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by the analogs. The effects of the analogs on secretion of the three hormones followed the same rank order of potency. However, the active analogs displayed 2-6 times lower affinities in inhibiting PRL than GH or TSH secretions. The shift in affinity was even more pronounced in the case of the lower potency of the analogs as inhibitors of adenylate cyclase activity compared to hormone secretions. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml; 24 h) blocked SRIF inhibition of basal and GRF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and decreased by 83% [125I]N-Tyr-SRIF binding. It also blocked the ability of SRIF to inhibit GRF-induced GH and TRH-induced PRL and TSH secretion. However, pertussis toxin also increased GRF stimulation of GH secretion and decreased TRH stimulation of both TSH and PRL secretion. We conclude from our data that SRIF-binding sites located on the three target cells of the adenohypophysis are of a single class. These binding sites are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, but the inhibition of hormone secretions by SRIF cannot be explained solely through adenylate cyclase inhibition. Another mechanism of transduction must be involved in the actions of SRIF on its three pituitary target cells.\r"

Concomitant measures of testosterone (T) were analyzed in the intact animals. Blood samples were drawn every 15 min for 28 h via an indwelling catheter. Plasma concentrations of cortisol and T were determined by RIA. Inverse diurnal patterns of cortisol and T secretion were documented in the control group. The circadian pattern of plasma cortisol was characterized by a progressive rise during the early morning hours (0200-0800 h), followed by a gradual decline until lowest levels were reached at 1600-1900 h. T levels were lowest from 0800-1200 h (2-4 ng/ml) and reached a zenith from 2200-0200 h (8-10 ng/ml). Surprisingly, circadian fluctuations in cortisol were absent after orchidectomy. Cortisol levels in castrates were less (P less than 0.05) than those during peak levels of cortisol secretion in the intact animals (6.25 vs. 10.1 micrograms/100 ml) and elevated (P less than 0.01) compared to concentrations in the intact animals at their nadir (6.4 vs. 2.5 micrograms/100 ml). The loss of circadian fluctuation was not associated with a significant change in frequency of pulsatile cortisol release or a change in the daily mean level. These results are the first in nonhuman primates to demonstrate that the testes modulate circadian activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. The data differ from previous findings in rodents suggesting that castration increases the synthesis and release of ACTH/corticosterone.\r"

Blood samples were drawn from a remote site at 15-min intervals for 24 h via an indwelling catheter. Measures of estrogen and progesterone were obtained for each subject. For purposes of data analyses, group cortisol measurements were collapsed across hourly intervals and submitted to analysis of variance. Pulsatile characteristics of cortisol release were determined for each subject using the PULSAR computer program. Circadian cortisol patterns, present in all three groups, were characterized by a progressive rise during early morning hours (0300-0600 h), followed by a decline of short duration. All groups then displayed an unexpected midday peak (0900-1400 h), at which time cortisol levels reached their daily zenith. In each of the three groups, cortisol levels reached a nadir during late afternoon hours shortly after the light phase ended. The amplitude of circadian changes and daily mean levels of cortisol were significantly reduced by ovariectomy, without alterations in pulsatile characteristics of cortisol secretion. Daily mean cortisol levels decreased from approximately 8 micrograms/100 ml in intact subjects to 4.5 micrograms/100 ml after ovariectomy. No significant differences in the circadian/ultradian periodicity of cortisol secretion were detected between the follicular and luteal groups. When data in the intact female groups were combined and compared to those previously obtained from gonadally intact adult male macaques, similar 24-h patterns of cortisol secretion were detected. Surprisingly, amplitude changes in cortisol concentrations after ovariectomy were temporally and quantitatively similar to those in orchidectomized males. In both male and female animals, circadian patterns of cortisol secretion were reduced by gonadectomy. These results are discussed in terms of the activational influence of gonadal steroids on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical function.\r"

AA was measured in homogenates of brain tissue by using a radiometric assay that quantifies the production of 3H2O from [1 beta-3H]androstenedione as an index of estrogen formation. Initially, we assessed the capability of block-dissected tissues to aromatize androgens. We found that the AA in the amygdala and hypothalamus-preoptic area of Tfm rats was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) than the AA in NL despite the fact that circulating androgen concentrations in the Tfm were significantly higher. Kinetics studies demonstrated that the apparent Michaelis constant was equivalent for both groups (0.02-0.03 microM). Administration of testosterone propionate to castrated males produced 3 to 4-fold elevations of AA in NL, but did not affect brain AA in Tfm rats. To pinpoint specific sites where AA is affected in Tfm rats, we measured AA in 10 hypothalamic and limbic nuclei that were dissected from 300-micron frozen brain sections. Compared to NL, Tfm rats exhibited significantly lower levels of AA in all micro-dissected brain regions studied, except for the medial and cortical amygdala. These data provide genetic evidence for both androgen-dependent and independent regulation of AA in the rat brain.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the functional and biochemical characteristics of membrane receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were evaluated in vitro, using epithelial intestinal cells isolated during rat development, from day 17 of gestation to adulthood. These characteristics included cell cAMP generation, adenylate cyclase and cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase cAMP-PDE activities, [125I]VIP-binding capacity, and the molecular components of [125I]VIP-binding sites. In 19-day-old fetuses, VIP induced a significant and persistent increase in cAMP production, which lasted for 10 min in intestinal cells. This effect, measured at 37 C in the absence of cAMP-PDE inhibitor, only lasted for 3 min in 5-day-old rats and was undetectable in adult intestine. Addition of the cAMP-PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine with VIP caused, potentiated, and maintained elevated cAMP levels at the three stages considered. Intestinal cells were more sensitive to VIP in 17- and 19-day-old fetuses (ED50 = 5 and 17 X 10(-11) M VIP, respectively, at 15 and 37 C) than in adult rats (EC50 = 2.7 and 1.6 X 10(-9) M VIP). Adenylate cyclase activity rose 4-fold in fetal intestine and had an apparent Ka of 4 X 10(-10) M VIP. These changes in VIP receptor activity were not observed for PGE2 receptors in developing rat intestinal cells or in the VIP-sensitive adenylate cyclase system prepared from liver of fetuses and adults. They might be due to differences between the molecular components of the intestinal VIP receptor, which were identified here as autoradiographic bands of 64,800 daltons in 19-day-old rat fetuses and 74,600 daltons in adults (P less than 0.01). Alternatively, the changes in VIP receptor activity in 5-day-old rats may result from decreases in the number and affinity of the [125I]VIP-binding sites and increases in the velocity of cAMP-PDE activity. The release of VIP from intestinal nerve endings during fetal and postnatal development and the absorption of VIP from milk might, therefore, modulate the intestinal VIP receptor and its effector systems. Because specific VIP receptors were expressed before the morphological and functional differentiation of intestinal and liver cells, we conclude that their activity is an indicator of their development, and suggest that in rats, this neuropeptide may regulate the maturation and functions of intestine and liver during fetal life.\r"

The mean scrotal temperature values of the infertile men were significantly greater than those observed in the fertile men (+0.4 degrees C for the right; +0.5 degrees C for the left). In the infertile men, it was found that the higher the scrotal temperature, the more alterated the sperm characteristics. The only clinical element that seemed to be linked to the existence of scrotal hyperthermia in the infertile men was testicular hypotrophy. Although the scrotal temperatures of the infertile men with varicocele were significantly higher than those of the fertile men, they did not significantly differ from those of the infertile men without varicocele. No other specific pathologic factor, infectious or surgical urogenital history was found to be responsible for the scrotal hyperthermia observed in the infertile men.\r"

Semen samples from 60 men, 24 proven fathers and 36 patients, were analyzed for agreement with the theoretical Poisson distribution (PD). Most of the fathers (23 of 24) fit PD well, but 10 of the patients did not. The overall (group) fit of fathers is good, but that of the patients is poor. Patients, but not fathers, are heterogeneous in their agreement with PD; about 25% fit poorly whereas more than 50% fit well. The 25% fitting poorly may often be those patients who are truly infertile (even when their wives are actually fertile).\r"

There were no differences in the depth of thermal damage, extent of collagen deposition, or in postoperative adhesion formation between CO2 laser and electrocautery. However, the mean depth of the acute thermal damage was significantly less on the ovary than on the uterus, and the area of fibrosis was significantly less when the incised uterine surfaces were approximated.\r"

Ovaries were perfused with CC (10(-5) M) or CC + E2 (1 to 1000 ng/ml). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 50 IU) was added to the perfusate of each ovary. In vitro ovulated ova in cumulus were retrieved and inseminated in vitro. E2 significantly increased the percentage of ovulated ova achieving (1) the 2-cell stage at 36 hours, (2) the morula stage by 84 hours, and (3) the blastocyst stage at 132 hours. The percentage of inseminated ova showing evidence of degeneration was reduced in ovaries treated with E2. These data suggest that CC may exert an antiestrogenic effect on the intrafollicular oocyte, which interferes with postfertilization development.\r"

To identify the response to estrogens of each of the major mucus components (mucin[s], soluble proteins, and small electrolytes and water), the authors quantitated their accumulation rates before and during estrogen stimulation in the rabbit. Circulating radiolabeled markers (35S-sulfate and 131I-albumin) were used to monitor the incorporation of small and large molecular weight intravascular substances into the cervical mucus. The accumulation rate of mucins was unaffected by exogenous estrogen administration, despite significant increases in mucus volume. This increase in mucus volume was attributed to a significantly increased transudation of water and small electrolytes increasing mucus hydration as early as the first 2 hours of estrogen administration. Water, small electrolytes, and soluble proteins significantly increased during the third and fourth hours of estrogen administration, not only when compared with the unstimulated basal levels, but also when compared with the levels found during the first 2 hours of estrogen administration. No significant change occurred in mucin production, while significant changes occurred in the accumulation of proteins and small electrolytes, whether estrogen was given initially or terminally in the experiment protocol.\r"

Because of this high degree of diagnostic accuracy, we speculated on the clinical utility of an outpatient D and C for those patients in our series having a P less than 15 ng/ml. Laparoscopy would be reserved for those cases without identifiable chorionic villi on frozen section of curettings. Following this course of management could have potentially diagnosed all EPs at the first ER visit without disruption of a single normal IUP in our series. This sequence could have expedited the diagnosis of EP by up to 14 days compared with a standard hCG/US protocol. This report describes a promising new test for the early detection of EP. The findings, however, require confirmation in a prospective trial before widespread clinical implementation.\r"

Of the 68 women who became pregnant or completed at least three cycles of insemination, the overall pregnancy rate was 38.2%, with a mean of 1.7 treatment cycles per pregnancy. The average pregnancy rate per treatment cycle was 11.4%. Women who did not become pregnant underwent an average of 4.7 treatment cycles. Importantly, only two pregnancies occurred independent of treatment in 113 couples. In the male factor group, the pregnancy rate was 42.9% (n = 21). In women with a cervical factor, 34.5% became pregnant (n = 29); in idiopathic infertile couples or women suffering from endometriosis, there was a pregnancy rate of 38.9% (n = 18). The presence of sperm antibodies in either the male or female partner significantly lowered the pregnancy rate (6.7%) when compared with couples without sperm antibodies (50.0%). The authors conclude from these observations that IUI with washed sperm is a successful mode of therapy, especially in the case of males with asthenozoospermia.\r"

The midluteal P-amplitude (K) was also obtained mathematically. Daily luteal P levels from five normal ovulatory cycles were assessed for the biologic variation of ILPL and K, then compiled to construct a normogram of the ILP during the luteal phase. The coefficient of variation of K and total ILPL in each cycle ranged from 9.7% to 24.3% and 3.5% to 13.2%, respectively. Fifty-two infertility patients were evaluated for their luteal function by the luteal P and estradiol (E2) level, K, ILPL, endometrial biopsy (EBX)-lag-day, as well as the lengths of follicular phase, luteal phase (L#), and cycle. Thirty-nine patients had EBX-lag day less than or equal to 2 days and were designated as infertile-normal (INF-NL) luteal phase, while the remaining 13 patients who had EBX-lag day greater than 2 days were considered as luteal phase defect (LPD). Significant (P less than 0.05) differences were observed between INF-NL and LPD in: luteal length (13.2 +/- 0.31 versus 11.0 +/- 0.58 days, respectively), and total ILPL (170 +/- 8.3 versus 113 +/- 8.5 ng/ml-day, respectively). No differences were seen in luteal P, E2 and K levels, nor in follicular and cycle length. Significant (P less than 0.05) correlations were observed between total ILPL and luteal P, E2, L#, and K; while a negative correlation was noted between follicular and luteal length.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two hundred thirty-one infertility patients qualified for this study in 1155 cycles, during which basal body temperature charts were kept and the quality of cervical mucus was evaluated. Nine types of responses were classified: three ovulatory (O1, O2, O3), three anovulatory (A1, A2, A3), and three miscellaneous (M1, M2, M3). The overall, uncorrected pregnancy rate was 54.9%, and 79.2% showed ovulatory responses. The most common response was O1 (normal responses, 38.5%) with the highest pregnancy rates (92.1%). Poor estrogenic response with poor cervical mucus (CM) (O2) was fairly common (13.4%) and had poor pregnancy rates, even with the addition of estrogens (12.9%). It is suggested that this new classification of CC responses will help to identify and more efficiently manage patients undergoing this form of therapy.\r"

This quite restrictive classification was the result of an arbitrary decision of the authors, who wanted to focus interpretation of their data on DHEAS, the well-known adrenal androgen. In the hyperandrogenic hirsute woman (HH), the DHEAS levels were higher than 3.0 micrograms/ml; in idiopathic hirsute women (IH), values of DHEAS were comparable to those observed in normal women (1.2 to 2.5 micrograms/ml). In the HH group, the levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, androst-5-ene-3 beta,17 beta-diol (delta 5-diol), testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstane-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol (3 alpha-diol), androstane-3 beta,17 beta-diol (3 beta-diol), androsterone (ADT), DHTG, 3 alpha-diol-G, 3 beta-diol-G, and ADTG were higher than the normal range whereas, in the IH group, only delta 5-diol, DHT, 3 beta-diol-G and ADTG were elevated. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the plasma levels of steroid G represent the peripheral formation of androgen in target tissues. Because the pattern of androgen metabolism is most probably changed in many cases of hirsutism, these data suggest that for research purposes, it would be preferable to measure 3 beta-diol-G and ADTG in addition to 3 alpha-diol-G in order to gain additional information concerning androgen metabolites in this disorder.\r"

Oocyte grade, retrieval order, and a quadratic term for grade remained significant for fertilization; cleavage, order, the interaction of order and grade, and the quadratic term for grade remained significant. Order correlated with anesthesia (r = 0.675, P less than 0.001). Also inherent in order are CO2 pneumoperitoneum, increased prolactin, decreased gonadotropins, ovarian trauma, and time. First oocytes of equivalent grade from contralateral ovaries were compared. Fertilization rates were equivalent, but significantly fewer mature oocytes from the second ovary cleaved. Anesthetic agents and CO2 appear to adversely affect fertilization and cleavage in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Follicular fluid estradiol (FF E2) and progesterone (P) have previously been shown to vary with the maturation of the follicle. A profile of follicular fluid E2 and P was obtained from follicles of 19 preovulatory oocytes, which resulted in normal term pregnancies from single embryo transfers. A narrow band was defined around the linear regression line E2/P = 1.2 X 10(-2) + 1.57 X 10(-4) E2, r = 0.806, P less than 0.01, when E2/P was plotted versus E2 that included 84.2% of these oocytes. Eleven of the 19 pregnancies were clustered between an E2 of 240 to 460 ng/ml and an E2/P ratio of 0.044 to 0.084. Sixty-eight patients undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer were studied. A significantly greater number of preovulatory follicles from the fertilized, cleaved, and pregnant group (10 of 40) was found in the cluster than from the fertilized, cleaved, but not pregnant group (4 of 46; P = 0.04) and fertilized but not cleaved group (0 of 13; P = 0.04). Significantly more pregnant patients (14 of 20) had a preovulatory follicle within the band than nonpregnant patients (11 of 36) (P less than .02), as well as in the cluster (10 of 20), compared with 4 of 36, respectively (P less than 0.01). It may be concluded that a range of FF E2 and E2/P values define a stage of maturation that is compatible with successful pregnancies.\r"

Embryos and their extraembryonic membranes (explants) were cultured either in control media or in media with low or very low glucose concentrations. At the start of the culture the glucose concentrations were 8.4 +/- 0.57, 4.5 +/- 0.10, and 3.5 +/- 0.07 mM. During the cultures, the explants progressively depleted the glucose in the medium until, after 48 h, the glucose concentrations were reduced to 1.1 +/- 0.18, 0.4 +/- 0.13, and 0.3 +/- 0.02 mM, respectively. At glucose concentrations less than 2.5 mM, the rate of glucose uptake by the explants progressively decreased, and embryonic growth and differentiation became increasingly retarded. After 48 h in glucose-deficient culture media, embryos had smaller crown-rump lengths, lower protein contents, and fewer somites than embryos from the control media (P less than .001). Most of the embryos exposed to the lower glucose concentrations also had severe dysmorphic lesions, especially of the head and branchial arches. The deleterious effects of exposure to low concentrations of glucose on embryonic development appeared not to be reversible. Embryos cultured for 24 h in media with a low concentration of glucose followed by 24 h in control medium grew and developed just as poorly as those cultured for the entire 48 h in the glucose-deficient media.\r"

  ".W": "Although anatomic abnormalities in capillary structure are well described in diabetes mellitus, physiologic responses of diabetic microcirculation are less clear. This study addresses whether cutaneous vasodilation occurs normally in diabetic subjects in response to a standard exercise of underlying muscle. The methods involve a washout analysis from forearm skin of the fast-moving isotope 133Xe and the diffusion-limited marker 111In-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Twenty-four normotensive type II diabetic patients of age (mean +/- SE) 59 +/- 1.4 yr were age and weight matched with 24 controls. Control subjects increased flow 50.6 +/- 6.4%, which was not different from the increase in diabetic subjects of 52.7 +/- 7.6%. Permeability-surface-area product (PS) increased in control subjects from 1.77 +/- 0.20 ml.min-1.100 g-1 to 3.79 +/- 0.50 (2P = .0001), whereas diabetic subjects did not show a change in PS (3.29 +/- 0.35 to 2.69 +/- 0.31). Resting PS was higher in diabetic than control subjects (P = .0003), perhaps indicating an already recruited capillary bed. During repetitive exercise, control subjects increased capillary density 125 +/- 27% (2P = .0001) above basal with a nonsignificant 14 +/- 8.4% decrease in mean capillary blood flow. Diabetic subjects responded with a nonsignificant decrease in capillary density and a significant 139 +/- 38% increase in capillary blood flow (2P = .001). It is concluded that, although overall vasodilation occurs normally in diabetic cutaneous circulation, the mechanism is different from the normal response in that flow increases by augmentation of capillary flow rather than by recruitment. This is consistent with the thesis promulgated by others that diabetic precapillary vessels have depressed vasodilatory responses or are already maximally vasodilated. The ability of diabetic subjects to vasodilate by augmentation was not correlated with years of diabetes or use of insulin and only slightly negatively correlated with random blood glucose levels (r = -.423, P less than .05).\r"

  ".U": "88055904\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to examine the effect of exaggerated polyol-pathway flux on sciatic nerve content of polyols, myo-inositol, and water. Rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes of 3- and 12-wk duration and nondiabetic rats fed for 5 days on a diet containing 20% galactose were employed initially. All three conditions showed marked elevation of nerve polyol content, combined with fructose accumulation in the diabetic rats. Galactose-fed rats showed a significant (P less than .01) increase in nerve water content of approximately 30% (when expressed as water/unit dry wt tissue). Diabetic rats showed no change in nerve water. Both diabetic and galactose-fed rats showed a depletion of nerve free myo-inositol, although the extent of depletion was greater in the latter. All these changes were prevented or attenuated by the aldose reductase inhibitor Statil (ICI 128436). When diabetic rats were fed a 20% galactose diet for 5 days, nerves of 3- but not 12-wk diabetic rats showed marked increases in water content. A more mild degree of galactosemia, induced by 5 or 21 days of feeding a diet containing 10% galactose to nondiabetic rats, provoked an increase in nerve water content associated with polyol levels of a similar order to those seen in diabetes. We do not know why polyol-pathway metabolites cause nerve hyperhydration in galactosemia but not in streptozocin-induced diabetes. Such differences urge caution in the use of galactose feeding to model the consequences of exaggerated polyol-pathway flux in nerve to face questions related to neuronal dysfunction in diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Although one of the earliest findings of diabetic retinopathy is altered capillary permeability, metabolic factors in diabetes that may increase the permeability of capillaries to fluorescein are unknown. We have studied the effect of a variety of vascular and retinal cells and hyperglycemia on the diffusion rate of fluorescein. These studies were performed with a cell culture system that mimics the cross-section of a capillary by having two chambers separated with a porous membrane that can support the growth of cells on either side of the membrane. The addition of a confluent layer of endothelial cells or retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells inhibited fluorescein diffusion between the two chambers 20- and 300-fold, respectively, after cells were cultured for greater than 5 days. Exposure of endothelial cells to 400 mg/dl glucose for either 3 or 100 days did not affect the barrier function of these cells. The barrier function of capillary endothelial cells isolated from BB rats with chronic diabetes and from nondiabetic animals did not differ. In contrast to endothelial cells and RPE cells, arterial smooth muscle and pericytes, which are not known to form tight junctions, did not inhibit the diffusion of fluorescein more than 2-fold. Surprisingly, the dual culture of endothelial cells with either retinal pericytes or smooth muscle cells resulted in a 50-fold increase in the rate of fluorescein diffusion, showing a disruption of the endothelial barrier. In summary, the intercellular connections between endothelial and epithelial cells that are responsible for the barrier to fluorescein diffusion are not functionally affected by chronic exposure to hyperglycemia or diabetic conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The screening practices of physicians from the two organizations were generally similar for psychosocial and behavioral problems, many forms of cancer, and numerous other conditions considered for inclusion in the routine periodic screening of asymptomatic individuals. However, for numerous diseases and tests, the screening practices of physicians from the two groups were significantly different. AAFP physicians were more likely to screen for lung and skin cancer, thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, and anemia, AAFP physicians were more likely to utilize chest x-ray, ECG, urinalysis, and SMA 6/12. STFM physicians were more likely to perform gonoccocal culture and tetanus-diphtheria immunization as well as to inquire about seat belt use. Three variables were found to predict physician screening practices as well as to account for the differences found between physicians drawn from the two organizations: completion of a residency in family medicine, year of graduation from medical school, and number of patients seen per week. Physicians reported practices were compared with recommendations in the major critical reviews: Frame and Carlson, Breslow and Sommers, the Canadian Task Force, and the American Cancer Society. For a number of tests and diseases physicians' reported practices were divergent with recent recommendations.\r"

Sixty-three physicians in the same settings completed a similar questionnaire indicating how involved they were in the same 30 problems. In general, physicians saw themselves as much more involved than patients wanted them to be. Patients expected referral much more frequently than physicians considered it, and for problems ranging from headaches to anxiety and life-cycle issues. Over 50% of the physicians expected to give help for relationship problems whereas 46% of the patients did not want the physician to even know that the problem existed. Demographic comparisons did not yield particularly noteworthy findings. The implications of these results are discussed.\r"

FPs ranked depression significantly higher than IMs did on all three scales, anxiety reactions higher in probability and severity, and both alcoholism and drug dependency higher on the severity scale. Ranks for schizophrenia and personality disorder did not differ between specialties. Thirty-eight physicians completed the scales a second time after six to eight weeks. Test-retest agreement ranged from 47% to 100% for different conditions on different scales. Some common psychiatric disorders tended to have low test-retest agreement in probability and severity. With further refinement, this instrument may contribute to the investigation of psychiatric decision making in primary care.\r"

  ".U": "88056111\r", 
  ".W": "Many liver processes are sexually dimorphic, and in rats, testosterone is the major steroid hormone determinant of the differing patterns of hepatic function. The microsomal content of specific enzymes and the syntheses of specific proteins are dependent on serum testosterone to maintain this dimorphism. Because the liver of male rats is strikingly androgen responsive, and because chronic alcohol ingestion decreases serum testosterone, we sought to determine whether chronic alcohol feeding would alter the masculine pattern of hepatic liver function in male rats. We quantitated both the cytosolic and nuclear forms of the hepatic androgen receptor. Alcohol feeding of male rats results in a significant loss of both types of androgen receptor sites; the specific binding capacity of both cytosolic and nuclear receptor in alcohol-fed rats is reduced to about 30% of that in either isocalorically fed rats or rats fed ad libitum. This reduction in hepatic androgen receptor activity is concomitant with a 50% reduction in serum testosterone content in the alcohol-fed animals. In addition, the activities of two hepatic androgen-responsive proteins, namely a cytosolic estrogen binder and a microsomal enzyme, estrogen 2-hydroxylase, demonstrate a decrease in activity that parallels the decreases in both forms of the androgen receptor. Administration of testosterone to the alcohol-fed animals normalized both the hepatic androgen receptor and the androgen-responsive protein activities. From these results, we conclude that chronic alcohol feeding results in a decreased androgen responsiveness of the liver, a condition that most likely results from the decreased serum testosterone levels in the alcohol-fed animals.\r"

Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were also recorded. In controls, the statistical evaluation by the cosinor method showed a circadian rhythm of such variables, with zenith in the morning and nadir at night. Intraday changes of urinary excretion of norepinephrine were closely related to arterial pressure and heart rate in most subjects. The most important change in cirrhotic patients was the achronia [no detection of a statistically significant (p greater than 0.05) rhythm] in urinary excretion of norepinephrine and arterial pressure. This occurred not only in group 2 patients, who had lower arterial pressure and higher NE mesors than controls (p less than 0.05), but also in group 1 patients, whose mesors were comparable to controls. The statistical significance of heart rate rhythmicity was preserved in patients, but its zenith was progressively displaced toward evening (group 1) and night hours (group 2, whose mesor was increased). Changes in urinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid roughly paralleled those of norepinephrine both in controls and patients, but they did not significantly increase even in the group with ascites. In both groups of cirrhotic patients, the correlation between urinary excretion of norepinephrine, arterial pressure, and heart rate within the same subject was lost in most cases. This chronobiological study showed that the sympathoadrenergic activity can be deranged also in the early stages of cirrhosis, and suggested that an altered control of cardiovascular homeostasis is present even under steady state conditions. This alteration might blunt adrenergic responses to stress conditions.\r"

In the present study, we documented the effect of BRIC sera on hepatic bile flow in rats and in vitro [14C]taurocholate bile salt uptake and efflux from isolated rat hepatocytes. Sera from patients with cholestatic disease (2 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis) and healthy volunteers served as controls. Rat hepatic bile flow increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during intravenous infusions of BRIC sera but remained unaltered during infusions with disease and healthy control sera. [14C]Taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was decreased to a similar extent by BRIC and disease control sera. [14C]Taurocholate efflux from hepatocytes was unaltered by BRIC, disease, or healthy control sera. Quantitative technetium-diisopropyliminodiacetic acid cholescintigraphy in the BRIC patient revealed prompt uptake of the radiolabeled organic anion but no biliary excretion after 21 h. Disease control patients also demonstrated prompt hepatic uptake of radiotracer, but some biliary excretion was evident. These results suggest that BRIC cholestasis is not mediated by a circulating cholestatic agent but rather is secondary to an intrinsic abnormality in hepatocyte bile salt secretion.\r"

We have examined the biosynthesis, posttranslational processing, transport, and cleavage of secretory component in cultured rat hepatocytes. Membrane secretory component is detected at the cell surface beginning 1.0-1.5 h after synthesis, whereas fSC is not found in the medium until 2.5-3 h after synthesis. Approximately 16% of metabolically labeled mSC is accessible at the cell surface at 4 degrees C. Surface accessible mSC labeled with 125I at 4 degrees C is internalized with a half-time of less than 5 min after warming to 37 degrees C and begins to be released as fSC after 20 min at 37 degrees C. Posttranslational processing and cleavage of mSC by cultured hepatocytes yields products that appear to be identical to those produced in vivo. Although the kinetics of some of these events are significantly slower than those observed in vivo, the major fraction of mSC accessible at the surface of cultured hepatocytes is internalized before cleavage to fSC, as occurs with mSC present on the sinusoidal domain of hepatocytes in vivo. Cultured hepatocytes provide a suitable model system for the examination of mSC transport and cleavage to fSC.\r"

All patients cleared hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid from the serum, and clearance preceded the loss of hepatitis B e antigen by 9-49 mo (mean 24 +/- 4 mo). Seropositivity for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid was always associated with histologic features of chronic active hepatitis. Resolution of histologic activity followed the loss of hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid from the serum and it preceded clearance of hepatitis B e antigen in all patients. A transient elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase activity occurred in 5 patients at the time that absence of hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid in serum was first demonstrated, and it was followed by resolution of histologic activity. The serum level of hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid slowly decreased or remained unchanged in all but 1 patient during long-term corticosteroid therapy. We conclude that hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid in serum is associated with histologic activity in corticosteroid-treated patients with severe chronic active hepatitis B. Disappearance of hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid from the serum precedes the loss of histologic activity and clearance of hepatitis B e antigen. Serum hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid levels usually do not increase during long-term corticosteroid therapy.\r"

Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid was quantitated and the molecular forms determined using molecular hybridization in two separate liver specimens taken at least 1 yr apart. All 30 patients initially had hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen in serum and all had hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid, including replicative intermediate forms, present in liver. The amount of viral deoxyribonucleic acid in liver correlated significantly with the e antigen titer in serum. At the time of the second liver biopsy, e antigen was no longer detectable in the serum of 12 patients although all except 1 patient still had detectable hepatitis B surface antigen. In this group, the amount of hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid in liver had decreased significantly and replicative viral intermediates had disappeared. In contrast, among patients who remained e antigen-positive, the amount of viral deoxyribonucleic acid did not change appreciably and replicative intermediate forms were still detectable. These findings imply that in chronic hepatitis B, loss of e antigen is usually associated with resolution of hepatitis B virus replication.\r"

  ".W": "Cholecystokinin has previously been shown to produce a rise in immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies in the intestinal fluid of human volunteers. Whether the source of these antibodies was pancreatic, biliary, or mucosal had not been defined. The object of the present investigation was to study factors involved in regulating the release of IgA and IgG antibodies from the intestinal mucosa. Hooded-Lister rats were sensitized to ovalbumin. After the sensitization protocol, which lasted 21 days, the rats were anesthetized and a segment of intestine 10 cm long was isolated and perfused in vivo. This segment was flushed with normal saline for 30 min to remove all pancreatic, biliary, and other secretions. It was found in this model that after the intravenous injection of cholecystokinin-octapeptide there was a rise of IgA and IgG antibodies within 2.5 min. Significantly increased secretion of IgA lasted for 10 min, and increased secretion of IgG lasted for 20 min. The cholecystokinin antagonist proglumide reduced the secretions of both immunoglobulins. Atropine reduced baseline IgA secretion by one-half. Intragastric protein hydrolysate, which left the body through the severed end of the duodenum, also raised IgA and IgG levels significantly in the perfused intestine. Control animals receiving intragastric normal saline did not have an elevation of IgA or IgG levels. The phenomena described here demonstrate that the rate of IgA release from the mucosa is influenced by endocrine and nervous stimuli. The rate of IgG release is, as far as could be ascertained, only under endocrine control and not significantly influenced by the cholinergic antagonist atropine.\r"

  ".W": "The action of intragastric ethanol in various concentrations (1.4%-40% vol/vol) and of beer, white wine, cognac, and whisky on gastric acid secretion and release of gastrin was studied in healthy humans. Ethanol concentrations of 1.4% and 4% (vol/vol), but not higher, significantly (p less than 0.05) increased gastric acid secretion to 23% and 22%, respectively, of incremental maximal acid output [i.e., observed response to pentagastrin (6 micrograms/kg s.c.) minus basal acid output]. The 1-h incremental gastric acid responses to beer and wine were 96% and 61%, respectively, of incremental maximal acid output. Neither cognac nor whisky had any stimulatory effect. The 1-h incremental gastric acid response to an 8% peptone meal was 40% of incremental maximal acid output, and to peptone plus white wine 77%. Plasma gastrin levels were not altered by ethanol, cognac, and whisky. The 1-h integrated plasma gastrin responses to beer and white wine were 119% and 77%, respectively, of the response to the peptone meal. We conclude that (a) the action of pure ethanol on gastric acid secretion is related to its concentration: concentrations of 1.4% and 4% are moderate stimulants; concentrations of 5%-40% have no effect, or rather an inhibitory effect; (b) beer and white wine, but not whisky and cognac, are potent stimulants of gastric acid secretion; (c) the stimulatory mechanism of low ethanol concentrations is unknown; and (d) nonalcoholic constituents of beer and wine are most likely responsible for the stimulatory actions of both beverages on gastric acid secretion and release of gastrin.\r"

Twenty-four healthy control subjects and 44 patients with duodenal ulcer disease were studied under fasting conditions and for 3 h after a standard liquid meal. Mean and median hydrogen ion activity, percentage of time with pH below 2 and 3, and the frequency of pH fluctuations were calculated from digital pH data sampled at a frequency of once per second from each electrode. None of these measurements of acidity differed significantly between the two groups or between subgroups of normosecretor controls and hypersecretor ulcer patients. At the time of pH study 15 of the patients had endoscopically verified active ulcer disease and 13 patients were without disease activity. Gastric as well as duodenal bulb acidity was the same in these two subgroups. We conclude that even though duodenal ulcer patients deliver more acid into the duodenum, this does not cause increased luminal acid aggression.\r"

  ".W": "Anorectal function in ulcerative colitis was assessed by measuring pressures at multiple sites in the anus and rectum under basal conditions and during balloon distention of the rectum in 29 patients with ulcerative colitis (12 active, 11 quiescent, and 6 during both phases) and in 12 normal controls. Resting and squeeze sphincter pressures were similar in the three groups. The lowest rectal volume that could be perceived, the volume required to induce a desire to defecate, and the maximum tolerable rectal volume were all lower in patients with active colitis than in patients with quiescent colitis (p less than 0.001) and controls (p less than 0.001). The rectal volume required to cause a sustained anal relaxation was lower in patients with active colitis (p less than 0.05) than in controls. Both peak and steady state rectal pressures in response to rectal distention were significantly higher in patients with active colitis than in patients with quiescent colitis (p less than 0.05) and controls (p less than 0.02). Paired studies showed that during remission of disease there was a decrease in rectal sensitivity (p less than 0.05) and an increase in rectal compliance (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that the frequent and urgent defecation, i.e., the predominant feature of active colitis, is related to a hypersensitive and poorly compliant rectum, which, upon distention, is more reactive and is more likely to induce prolonged sphincter relaxation.\r"

  ".U": "88056127\r", 
  ".W": "Histamine dihydrochloride (40 or 80 mg/kg, dissolved in 10% gelatin) subcutaneously administered to fasted rats induced few lesions in the gastric mucosa within 4 h. Pretreatment with subcutaneously administered 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2; greater than or equal to 10 micrograms/kg) dose-dependently worsened mucosal injury induced by histamine, mostly with severe hemorrhage in the corpus mucosa along the greater curvature, although dmPGE2 alone did not induce any macroscopic damage. The mucosal vascular permeability as measured using Evans blue was slightly but significantly augmented by either dmPGE2 (30 micrograms/kg) or histamine (80 mg/kg) alone, but was markedly increased by histamine in the presence of dmPGE2. The increased vascular permeability occurred within 2 h, and preceded the appearance of hemorrhagic mucosal injury. Both the mucosal injury and the increased vascular permeability caused by histamine (80 mg/kg) in the presence of dmPGE2 (30 micrograms/kg) were significantly reduced by pretreatment with tripelennamine (30 mg/kg) and prednisolone (3 mg/kg), but not affected by atropine sulfate, cimetidine, methysergide, or indomethacin. The stimulation of acid secretion caused by histamine was significantly inhibited by dmPGE2 (30 micrograms/kg). Repeated administration of histamine (40 or 80 mg/kg) in the same area of the stomach in the presence of dmPGE2 (30 micrograms/kg), once or twice daily for 4 days to fed rats, induced more pronounced damage than single-dose treatment. These results suggest that dmPGE2 may aggravate gastric mucosal injury induced by histamine in rats probably due to potentiation of the increased vascular permeability caused by histamine through stimulation of H1-receptors.\r"

Monoiodinated, biologically active (Tyr-4)-bombesin 14 (100 pM) was applied to sections of canine gut and localized using quantitative autoradiography. The highest density of bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide specific binding sites occurred over endocrine cells in the antral mucosa. Specific binding sites were also found on the circular muscle layer of the gastric fundus, gastric antrum, and ileum, on longitudinal muscle of the gastric fundus and antrum, and on neuronal elements in the myenteric plexus in the gastric fundus, antrum, and small intestine. No evidence for specific binding of 125I-(Tyr-4)-bombesin 14 was found in sections of canine esophagus, gastric cardia, gallbladder, pancreas, or colon. These results suggest sites of direct action of bombesin and endogenous gastrin-releasing peptide for gastrin release and gastrointestinal motility.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the mechanisms by which 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 and histamine induced pancreatic hemorrhage in an experimental model of acute pancreatitis in cats. In normal animals, when large molecular weight dextran molecules were infused into the systematic circulation, they were recovered in secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice in low concentrations. Both 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (in a dose that increased splenic artery blood flow and microvascular permeability) and histamine (in a dose that increased permeability only) increased the amount of dextran recovered in pancreatic juice. Isoproterenol, in a dose that produced the same increase in blood flow as 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 but which did not increase microvascular permeability, did not alter the amount of dextran recovered. This suggested that the increase in dextran output after 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 was primarily due to the increase in microvascular permeability caused by the drug. In other experiments, a combination of H1- and H2-receptor antagonists (mepyramine and cimetidine) protected against the development of pancreatic hemorrhage in both the prostaglandin- and histamine-treated animals. Indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) protected against the development of hemorrhage in the histamine-treated animals. Our results support the hypothesis that changes in microvascular permeability may be important in the pathogenesis of parenchymal hemorrhage in this model.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of estrogen as well as progesterone receptors has been applied clinically to predict the effectiveness of endocrine therapy in patients with breast or endometrial carcinoma. The presence of cytosolic estrogen receptors in human colorectal carcinomas has been reported by several different groups during the past 10 yr. The aim of our current study was to evaluate the estrogen binding activity in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions of these carcinomas, as well as in surrounding noncancerous colonic tissue. Twenty-six patients, operated on for colorectal carcinoma, were studied: 16 were men and 10 were postmenopausal women, mean age 61 yr (range 43-78 yr). In neoplastic tissue, cytosolic estradiol receptors were detected in 42.3% of the patients (women 40%, men 43.7%). The values for cytosolic estrogen receptor ranged from 118 to 1214 fmol/g wet colon. Nuclear estrogen receptors were detectable in 46.1% of the patients (women 40%, men 50%) and their values displayed a range from 3.4 to 2554 fmol/g wet colon. In 30.7% of the patients, both nuclear and cytosolic receptors were demonstrated. In 38.4% of the patients, receptors were found in neither cytosol nor nuclei. Receptor positivity in men was most frequently associated with tumors removed from the rectum, and those with Dukes' classification of C1. In the surrounding noncancerous tissue cytosolic estrogen receptors were also detected (range 133-1105 fmol/g wet colon) and were present in 34.6% of the patients (women 30%, men 37.5%). Nuclear estrogen receptors (range 225-1105 fmol/g wet colon) were detected in 57.6% of the patients (women 40%, men 68.7%). In 23% of the patients, both nuclear and cytosolic receptors were demonstrated. In 30.7% of the patients, no receptors were found in either cytosol or nucleus. Therefore, the presence of cytosolic or nuclear estrogen receptors, or both, in 61.6% of human colorectal cancer specimens emphasizes the need to evaluate both forms of these receptors for studies of potential hormone dependence in these tumors.\r"

In the 4 patients with small intestinal carcinoma, carcinomas were poorly differentiated or signet-ring cell type in 3 cases and mucinous type in 1 case. All 4 patients had high-grade dysplasia in the mucosa immediately adjacent to the carcinoma only. In the 7 patients with colonic carcinoma, tumors were mucinous type in 3, signet-ring cell type in 1, and well or moderately differentiated in 3. Dysplasia could be assessed in 6 patients. In 4 patients it was both adjacent to and distant from the invasive carcinoma. This distant dysplasia was focal in 2 cases. One patient showed dysplasia adjacent to the carcinoma only and in 1 other patient no dysplasia was seen. In a comparison group, all 7 cases of carcinoma associated with ulcerative colitis showed dysplasia adjacent to and distant from the invasive carcinomas. The authors conclude that (a) associated dysplasia is prevalent enough in Crohn's disease-associated carcinomas to support a dysplasia-carcinoma sequence and (b) dysplasia is more limited with carcinoma in Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis, and this may make dysplasia less useful as a cancer surveillance marker in Crohn's disease.\r"

Among 42 aspirates judged to be infected by computed tomography-guided aspiration, all but one were confirmed by surgery or indwelling catheter drainage. Among 50 aspirates judged to be sterile, no subsequent evidence of infection was found. All patients tolerated the procedure well and no complications were noted. As a result of this technique, we observed that pancreatic infection occurs earlier than has been previously appreciated (within 14 days of the onset of pancreatitis in 20 of the 36 patients) and that infection may recur during prolonged bouts of pancreatitis. We conclude that guided aspiration is a safe, accurate method for identifying infection of the pancreas at an early stage.\r"

Skatole and indole, the benzopyrrole volatiles believed to be responsible for fecal odor, in fact elaborated a napthalenelike \"mothball\" odor in the crystalline state as well as after purging from feces. A small amount of hydrogen sulfide gas was also identified in fecal samples. The components responsible for fecal odor are complex and may be influenced by dietary and endogenous contributions. However, the major components are methyl sulfide compounds rather than skatole and indole as is currently believed.\r"

Carcinoembryonic antigen and secretory component were found to be markers of distinctly different stages of normal colonocyte differentiation. Whereas secretory component was expressed principally by proliferating absorptive cells in the midcrypt, carcinoembryonic antigen expression was diminished in this crypt zone and was associated principally with mature columnar cells at the luminal surface and with undifferentiated cells at the crypt base. Carcinoembryonic antigen was preferentially expressed on the microvillar plasma membrane and secretory component on the basolateral plasma membrane in the normal colon. In 13 colon cancers studied, carcinoembryonic antigen was expressed on the entire surface of all the colon cancers except one anaplastic tumor, whereas secretory component was only expressed on five well or moderately differentiated cancers. These observations suggest that differentiation of colon cancers as assessed by morphology and phenotypic markers is not totally analogous to that found in the normal colon.\r"

Colonic biopsy specimens were taken from patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. Control tissue was obtained from the margins of colonic resections performed for neoplastic or nonneoplastic diseases. Sections of the specimens were examined by periodic acid-Schiff staining, high iron diamine Alcian blue staining for sialomucins and sulfomucins, and binding of the lectins peanut agglutinin, Ulex europeus agglutinin I, and Ricinis communis I agglutinin. Sections were reacted also with anticarcinoembryonic antigen antibodies to determine whether a nonpolar surface distribution of the antigen was a feature of dysplasia. We found that changes in colonic mucin, characterized by periodic acid-Schiff-positive mucin outside of goblet cells, an increase in binding of peanut agglutinin, and an increase in the relative amount of sialylated mucin, were associated with morphologic dysplasia. However, identical alterations were observed, albeit less commonly, in colitis without dysplasia, particularly in the presence of active inflammation. No abnormality in the surface distribution of carcinoembryonic antigen or Ricinis communis I agglutinin was observed. Thus, we did not identify a reliable corollary test to the histologic diagnosis of mucosal dysplasia in ulcerative colitis. With regard to these histochemical markers, the colonic mucosa appears to respond similarly to inflammation and neoplasia.\r"

These were compared with samples of stomach and intestine. In the smooth muscle of the muscularis externa, the muscularis mucosae, and beneath the epithelium, the most abundant nerve fibers contained vasoactive intestinal peptide and neuropeptide Y, in contrast to the scarcity of substance P, enkephalin, somatostatin, and gastrin-releasing peptide. Gastric and intestinal samples contained dense populations of fibers containing vasoactive intestinal peptide, neuropeptide Y, substance P, and enkephalin in the equivalent layers, but somatostatin- and gastrin-releasing peptide-immunoreactive fibers were scarce. Complete coexistence of vasoactive intestinal peptide and neuropeptide Y in nerve fibers within the muscle layers was demonstrated in the esophagus, but not in gastric and intestinal samples. The myenteric plexus along the length of the esophagus contained cell bodies and fibers reactive for vasoactive intestinal peptide, neuropeptide Y, enkephalin, and substance P. Somatostatin-immunoreactive cell bodies were very rare in the myenteric plexus, no gastrin-releasing peptide-immunoreactive cell bodies were seen, and both somatostatin and gastrin-releasing peptide-immunoreactive fibers were rare. In the upper esophagus, striated muscle bundles did not contain nerve fibers reactive for these peptides but immunoreactive fibers were seen in the muscularis mucosae and subepithelium. It is concluded that the esophagus has a different pattern of innervation by peptide-containing neurons than the stomach and intestines. Esophageal neurons can be classified into separate classes on the basis of their peptide content.\r"

  ".W": "A new breath test for noninvasive assessment of pancreatic exocrine function in humans was developed. The test is based on the hydrolysis of cholesteryl-[1-14C]octanoate by pancreatic carboxyl ester lipase (cholesterol esterase) with subsequent absorption and hepatic metabolism of the liberated octanoate to 14CO2. The rate at which 14CO2 appears in breath appeared to be proportional to the rate of hydrolysis. The substrate is administered as a gum acacia stabilized emulsion of vegetable oil (18 g) containing cholesteryl octanoate (2 g; 4.4 microCi) dispersed in a 500-ml isotonic meal. Tests were performed in 6 healthy volunteers and 11 patients with pancreatic disease with varying degrees of steatorrhea. In healthy subjects, 14CO2 output was rapid with peak output occurring at 60-90 min in all subjects; cumulative output in 4 h averaged 30%. Duplicate studies indicated that the time-course of 14CO2 recovery was reproducible. The pattern of 14CO2 output in patients with pancreatic disease varied widely. Patients without steatorrhea (fecal fat less than or equal to 7 g/day) or with mild steatorrhea (fecal fat 7-11 g/day) had normal or near normal patterns of 14CO2 output, whereas patients with moderate or severe steatorrhea (fecal fat greater than 11 g/day) expired 14CO2 at a rate one-third to one-tenth that of the healthy volunteers. Addition of pancreatic enzyme supplementation to the test meal increased 14CO2 output in 6 of 6 patients with moderate or severe steatorrhea, suggesting that the activity of pancreatic carboxyl ester lipase was rate limiting in these patients. In an additional study in a healthy volunteer, 14CO2 and 13CO2 were measured simultaneously in breath after ingestion of a test meal containing cholesteryl-[1-13C]octanoate and 14C-octanoate. 14CO2 was expired more rapidly than 13CO2, suggesting that hydrolysis of the substrate may also be rate limiting in healthy volunteers. These studies indicate that severe pancreatic exocrine dysfunction can be detected with a simple breath test in 60-90 min.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of esophageal acid perfusion on salivation in patients with reflux esophagitis and in normal subjects. Serial 10-min saliva collections were obtained by expectoration during perfusion of the esophagus with water, and then 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) for 50 min or 0.01 N HCl (pH 2.1) for 120 min. Within 1-5 min of beginning 0.1 N HCl perfusion, all 8 patients with esophagitis developed heartburn accompanied by an increase in saliva flow. By the time the severity of heartburn required discontinuation of HCl perfusion (10-40 min), saliva flow had increased nearly fourfold. With 0.1 N HCl perfusion, 8 of 10 volunteers developed mild heartburn after 22 +/- 3 min (mean +/- SE), whereas 0.01 N HCl induced heartburn in 6 of 10 volunteers after 57 +/- 12 min of perfusion. Saliva flow increased concurrently with the onset of heartburn and doubled in those volunteers who developed heartburn. Saliva flow did not change in those volunteers who were without heartburn. We conclude that esophageal acid perfusion unaccompanied by heartburn does not affect salivation. However, saliva flow increases concurrently with the onset of heartburn, a phenomenon called \"water brash\" when clinically evident. The increased saliva flow that accompanies heartburn may act as an endogenous antacid that serves as a protective response to symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

  ".W": "The acute and chronic effects of hydrocortisone on exocrine pancreatic function were examined in the isolated perfused rat pancreas. In the first part of this study, rats were given subcutaneous injections of hydrocortisone at doses of 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg body wt once daily for 7 days. Trypsin and lipase secretion in response to 100 pM cholecystokinin-octapeptide was significantly increased in rats with the two highest doses of hydrocortisone compared with controls, irrespective of whether calculated as the total amount of stimulated output of enzymes or related to the secretion of enzyme to the pancreas content. On the other hand, the secretory responsiveness of amylase to 100 pM cholecystokinin-octapeptide was maximal at the 5-mg dose, and decreased with higher doses. In the second part, 100 microM hydrocortisone was superimposed for 20 min on 100 pM cholecystokinin-octapeptide stimulation to examine the acute effects of hydrocortisone on exocrine pancreatic function in the isolated perfused rat pancreas. Addition of hydrocortisone caused a significant inhibition of the secretion of pancreatic juice and amylase. The present study has clearly demonstrated the dual effects of glucocorticoids on the pancreas: inhibition and potentiation. There is a possibility that chronic treatment with large doses of glucocorticoid may sensitize the acinar cells an induce hypersecretion of trypsin and lipase, whereas acute treatment inhibits secretory function of exocrine pancreas.\r"

Investigations revealed the existence of high plasma levels of androgens and estrogens. In addition, the patient presented features compatible with the syndrome of partial androgen resistance. We propose that the hepatic lesions could be secondary to an abnormally high secretion of sex steroids. We suggest that in the absence of known intake of either estrogens or androgens, the existence of hepatocellular adenoma or focal nodular hyperplasia, or both, should indicate a search for abnormal secretion of sex steroids.\r"

The morbidity rate was 13.8% for intubation (perforation 7.8%, bleeding 3.4%, and aspiration pneumonia 2.2%) and 3.6% (one perforation) for laser. The mortality rate was 4.3% for intubation and 0% for laser. Specific indications for intubation were esobronchial fistulas, extensive strictures, and very long stenotic lesions. Very high cervical strictures and nonocclusive asymmetrical tumors were better treated with laser. In select cases, combined therapy can be useful. We conclude that both methods are highly efficient in restoring patency and relieving dysphagia. Further large scale randomized trials are necessary to compare functional results and survival rate.\r"

Twenty matched children with dyspeptic symptoms but an endoscopically normal duodenum were chosen as controls. Histological sections of fiberoptic biopsy specimens were submitted to double-blind examination by two observers: only four fulfilled accepted criteria for histological duodenitis. The concordance between endoscopic and histological results in our patients was 13.8%. No changes of duodenal endoscopic appearance predictive of duodenitis were identified. In 8 more cases (6 patients and 2 controls) the histological examination showed an isolated lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration of the lamina propria without any additional damage. We called this picture \"minimal change duodenitis\" and considered it as a variation of normal. In 17 patients and 11 controls, basal and maximal acid outputs were calculated and no significant differences were found. We concluded that duodenitis in children may be present, although rare, and its diagnosis requires histological examination of duodenal mucosa.\r"

There is emerging evidence to suggest that with careful utilization of antihypertensive drugs, blood pressure can be lowered in the elderly population. Whether isolated systolic hypertension should be treated aggressively remains an unanswered question despite the evidence that systolic hypertension can cause certain cardiovascular complications. An elderly patient with hypertension and concomitant coronary artery disease merits proper blood pressure control with appropriate drugs to prevent progression of coronary disease. The therapeutic objective is not only to lower the blood pressure but to accomplish this goal with drugs which are likely to have a favorable effect on coronary artery disease. Changing trends in the drug therapy of hypertension indicate that calcium antagonists and beta-blocking drugs offer a therapeutic advantage in elderly hypertensive patients with coronary artery diseases.\r"

However, studies have shown that such complaints as habitual snoring, frequent awakening, nocturnal sweating, and awakening with anxiety, may be signs of genuine sleep disorders. The most prevalent and most serious aging-related sleep disorder is sleep apnea. There is recent evidence of an association between sleep apnea and circulatory disorders, including hypertension, stroke, and angina pectoris, and with reduced life expectancy. The older sleep apnea victim may not complain of daytime sleepiness, the usual symptom in younger patients. Sleep apnea, and several other sleep disorders of the elderly are treatable, once an accurate diagnosis is made. Physicians are urged to make questions about sleep as routine as the taking of blood pressure.\r"

The tumour/normal liver (T/L) ratio after intra-arterial and intraportal injection of 113Sn microspheres was 1.04 (range: 0.38-1.15) and 0.03 (range: 0.006-0.22), respectively. After intravenous 14C-iodoantipyrine quantitative autoradiography of tumour and normal regions demonstrated a mean T/L ratio of 0.74 +/- 0.05. After hepatic artery ligation (HAL) and portal vein ligation (PVL) the values were 0.32 +/- 0.05 and 0.42 +/- 0.05, respectively. These results confirm that the vascularity of the tumours in this model is similar to human colorectal cancer metastases. Radiolabelled 14C 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was given intravenously, via the hepatic artery and via the portal vein (the latter two routes with and without DSM). Quantitative autoradiography of tumour regions showed that selective hepatic arterial administration with DSM resulted in a significantly increased concentration of 14C-5-FU within the tumours. These results suggest that DSM may enhance the therapeutic benefit of hepatic arterial 5-FU by increasing its uptake into tumours.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism for acute hypercalcaemia increasing pancreatic enzyme secretion is unknown. To determine if raised extracellular calcium concentrations can directly stimulate pancreatic enzyme output, we measured discharges of pulse labelled protein and chymotrypsin from isolated cat pancreatic lobules in the presence of normal and raised calcium concentrations. Incubation in 5.0 mmol/l calcium increased discharges of pulse labelled protein (four fold), chymotrypsin (2.5 fold) and amylase (2.2 fold), compared with control experiments with 2.5 mmol/l calcium (p less than 0.001). This effect was similar to the maximal effect of carbachol or caerulein. Compared with 5.0 mmol/l calcium, incubation at the higher calcium concentration of 10.0 mmol/l induced similar discharges of chymotrypsin and amylase, whereas the increase in discharge of pulse labelled protein was smaller (p less than 0.01). The effects of raised calcium were not altered by atropine. Incubation in a high calcium medium did not impair pancreatic acinar response to subsequent stimulation with carbachol, but incubation in hypothermia abolished the effects of high calcium concentrations, suggesting that increased enzyme discharge is caused by stimulation of secretion not to cell damage. These data are consistent with a direct stimulatory effect of raised extracellular calcium concentrations on pancreatic acinar cell function.\r"

Total SCFA concentration (mmol/kg) was low in the terminal ileum at 13 +/- 6 but high in all regions of the colon ranging from 131 +/- 9 in the caecum to 80 +/- 11 in the descending colon. The presence of branched chain fatty acids was also noted. A significant trend from high to low concentrations was found on passing distally from caecum to descending colon. pH also changed with region from 5.6 +/- 0.2 in the caecum to 6.6 +/- 0.1 in the descending colon. pH and SCFA concentrations were inversely related. Total SCFA (mumol/l) in blood was, portal 375 +/- 70, hepatic 148 +/- 42 and peripheral 79 +/- 22. In all samples acetate was the principal anion but molar ratios of the three principal SCFA changed on going from colonic contents to portal blood to hepatic vein indicating greater uptake of butyrate by the colonic epithelium and propionate by the liver. These data indicate that substantial carbohydrate, and possibly protein, fermentation is occurring in the human large intestine, principally in the caecum and ascending colon and that the large bowel may have a greater role to play in digestion than has previously been ascribed to it.\r"

Control subjects and patients with the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, both with and without mucosal ulceration, have been studied. A high incidence of rectal prolapse (94%) was present in the patients who voided. Overactivity of the anal sphincter during evacuation contributed to the fact that patients with mucosal ulceration required higher intrarectal pressures to void than the controls and the patients without mucosal ulceration. The results indicate that a combination of rectal prolapse and a high voiding pressure may act to cause the mucosal ulceration in this syndrome by exposing the rectal wall to a high transmural pressure gradient.\r"

  ".W": "Previous station pullthrough techniques of anal canal pressure measurement have not truly represented the differences among individuals and between sexes in the length and pressure profile of the anal canal. Furthermore, the techniques commonly used in anal canal pressure determination have not been adequately compared or standardised. Therefore, a mechanised rapid pullthrough technique using an 8-lumen, 4-quadrant, continuously perfused catheter was evaluated and used to define the anal canal pressure profile. For measurement of the resting anal canal pressures, this technique was compared with the more usual station pullthrough technique in 12 subjects. There were no differences in resting pressure recorded by either technique with infusion rates ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 cc/min/orifice and over a range of catheter withdrawal rates of 0.19 to 0.48 cm/sec. Twenty two subjects (12 men/10 women) had their anal canal pressure profiles assessed using the rapid pullthrough technique. Anal canal length representing the mean of four axes differed between the sexes (p less than 0.005) and the difference was largely accounted for by a decrease in length of the anterior axis in women. A standardisation technique was used to account for between subject variation and for a more accurate between sex comparison of the pressure profiles. Significant differences in radial symmetry were found between the sexes. In the anterior axis the pressure was higher distally in women, while in the anterior and lateral axes the pressure was higher proximally in men. Anteriorly in women the highest pressures were exerted over a much shorter canal length than in men.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies were carried out in 15 normal subjects and 14 patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence to test whether a rectoanal flap valve could be responsible for maintaining faecal continence in man. Intraluminal pressures were recorded from the rectum and from three sites in the anal canal during serial increases in intra-abdominal pressure, produced by forced expiration into a sphygmomanometer keeping the height of the column of mercury at prescribed levels. The anal pressures in the normal volunteers always remained higher than the intrarectal pressures even when these were as high as 230 cm H2O. This pressure gradient was the reverse of that which would be found if an anterior rectal flap valve maintained continence and suggests instead that continence is normally maintained by a reflex contraction of the external anal sphincter. The anal pressures in patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence, however, fell below the rectal pressure as the intra-abdominal pressure increased, creating the conditions for a flap valve. The valve was incompetent, however, because fluid infused into the rectum leaked from the anus whenever the rectal pressure exceeded the anal pressure.\r"

Our results showed that a lower percentage of normal subjects and a lower percentage of constipated patients were able to pass a 1.8 cm incompressible sphere compared with a 50 ml deformable balloon, although constipated patients found it more difficult than normal subjects to expel both types of simulated stool. It was also more difficult for normal subjects to pass a soft compressible silicon rubber simulated stool than a stool made up of a similar volume of incompressible 1 cm wooden spheres contained in a cylindrical latex envelope, but both objects were much easier to pass than the same number of 1 cm spheres placed loose within the rectum. When normal subjects were instructed to expel single incompressible spheres of different sizes placed in the rectal ampulla, the intrarectal pressure and the time needed to pass these objects varied inversely with their diameter. These results suggest that more effort is required to expel stools from the rectum if they are small and hard than if they are large and soft.\r"

Cellular and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic responses of the effector cells from animals during the establishment and acute phase of infection were significantly suppressed, compared with unstimulated uninfected and vaccinated (FI amoebic proteins stimulated) effector cells. The effector cells from animals recovered from infection showed enhanced cytotoxic responses against trophozoites of E histolytica. The suppressed cytotoxic response was accompanied by impairment of cytotoxic cell activities and lack, or very low level of anti-FI antibodies in the sera of animals during the establishment phase of infection. With the rise in anti-FI antibodies in the sera of animals ADCC could be induced effectively against trophozoites of E histolytica, which seem to result in clearance of amoebic infection.\r"

  ".W": "Utilising the population based data resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we estimated survival and risk of subsequent colon cancer in the 182 residents of Rochester, Minnesota, initially diagnosed with chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) between 1985 and 1979. Twenty five (13.7%) had a proctocolectomy during the course of follow up. Three patients developed colorectal adenocarcinoma after the initial diagnosis of CUC (relative risk = 1.9, 95% CI 0.4-5.4). Excluding proctitis cases, the relative risk of cancer was 2.4 (95% CI 0.3-8.7). At last follow up, 37 (20.3%) were dead; only 10 patients had chronic ulcerative colitis mentioned on the death certificate. Overall survival was similar to that expected for the general population of like age and sex. Our results suggest that chronic ulcerative colitis in the community is typically a milder disease than would appear from hospital or referral centre series.\r"

  ".W": "Mouth-caecum transit time (M-CTT) of a lactulose labelled liquid test meal has been measured in 27 coeliac patients and 10 healthy controls using the breath hydrogen technique. Although all patients were urged to maintain a gluten free diet, not all did, and there was, therefore, a wide range in the severity of fat malabsorption within the patient group. Gastric emptying of a 113Indium DTPA-labelled liquid test meal was also assessed in separate studies on six healthy controls and 11 of the coeliac patients. Fasting breath hydrogen concentrations and the response to lactulose, as assessed both by the rate of rise, and the peak breath hydrogen concentration reached, showed no difference between coeliacs and controls, regardless of the presence or absence of steatorrhoea. Mouth-caecum transit time in the 16 coeliac patients with steatorrhea (faecal fat greater than 7 g/24 h) was, however, significantly prolonged being 158 +/- 18 minutes (mean +/- SEM), compared with 70 +/- 9 minutes for the controls (p less than 0.02), and 83 +/- 15 minutes for the 11 coeliacs without steatorrhoea (p less than 0.002). Mouth-caecum transit time in the coeliac patients was linearly related to the 24 hour faecal fat excretion, r = 0.55, n = 27, p less than 0.01. Slow mouth-caecum transit in the coeliacs with steatorrhoea was not caused by delayed gastric emptying as the t1/2 for coeliacs with steatorrhoea was within the normal range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ovalbumin was detectable by ELISA in three of five coeliac children (maximal concentrations 8-178 ng/ml serum) and in five of five controls (maximal 4-91 ng/ml serum). Beta-lactoglobulin was detected in three of five coeliac children (maximal 0.6-6 ng/ml serum) and in two of five controls (maximal 0.5 and 50 ng/ml serum). No clear relationship was seen between maximal antigen concentrations and titres of serum IgG or IgA antibodies determined by ELISA, or as percentage antigen binding in a Farr type radioimmunoassay. Ovalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin was seen in serum of all coeliac patients and controls by HPLC fractionation in combination with ELISA, either in high MW fractions, or at the Mr of native OA and BLG, respectively. In one control degradation products (about 17 kD) of BLG were detectable in serum. The serum concentrations of OA and BLG were increased on gluten challenge in four or five coeliac children, indicating increased macromolecular passage through the gut mucosa in untreated coeliac disease.\r"

The rate of disappearance from the loops was always quantitatively significant but was greater in the proximal colon. Hindgut tissue metabolised propionate and the intensity of the metabolism varied with the segment studied; the proximal colon showed by far the highest propionate consumption. Radioactivity was found in a certain number of free amino acids, organic acids, sugars, lipid soluble substances and proteins.

  ".W": "It has been suggested that polymer coating might retard jejunal absorption of 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) and thus promote delivery to its colonic site of action. Twenty three patients with active (nine), or quiescent (14) ulcerative colitis were given either uncoated or coated 5-ASA (Asacol) 400 mg qds for one to three weeks, after which they ingested five 1.5 ml dialysis membrane sachets which were recovered from the stool in the next 72 hours. After one week of treatment the concentration of 5-ASA in the faecal dialysate, urine, and fasting plasma in those receiving the coated and uncoated preparations were respectively: 25.4 +/- 5.1 compared with 1.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (p less than 0.001); 0.34 +/- 0.21 compared with 0.70 +/- 0.29 mmol/24h (NS) and 11.1 +/- 4.2 compared with 0.07 +/- 0.03 mumol/l (p less than 0.02). Faecal excretion of the drug appeared to be greater in patients with active colitis than in those with quiescent disease. Thus coating with pH dependent methacrylic acid copolymer B is a very effective method of promoting delivery of 5-ASA to the colon, stool dialysate concentrations being 20 fold more than those in controls. Increased trough plasma concentrations in the polymer coating group probably reflect delayed intestinal absorption but no evidence of plasma accumulation after 21 days of therapy was found.\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine whether failure of the colon to salvage carbohydrate could contribute to the diarrhoea of ulcerative colitis we investigated the effect of ingesting a drink containing 20 g lactulose on stool output and breath hydrogen production in 39 colitic patients subdivided according to their disease extent and activity and in 14 normal volunteers. Each subject took a standard diet for four days and stool output was monitored throughout this period. Administration of lactulose on day three significantly increased stool weight and frequency in patients with both active and quiescent total colitis (p less than 0.01), but not in patients with distal colitis or in the volunteers. The basal and peak breath hydrogen responses to ingested lactulose were similar to normal controls in all patient groups but the hydrogen concentration tended to be higher in colitics. The mouth to caecum transit of the lactulose meal was slower in all groups of colitics (p less than 0.02) when compared with controls. These results suggest that impaired colonic salvage of carbohydrate could contribute to the diarrhoea in patients with total colitis who are ingesting a diet rich in unabsorbed carbohydrate, or who are hypolactasic.\r"

Fifty three patients with total ulcerative colitis (mean disease duration of 22 years) were regularly colonoscoped. Biopsies of colonic mucosa were analysed by flow cytometric technique and were also assessed histologically. Findings of abnormal DNA pattern (aneuploidy) were compared with findings of dysplasia. Five patients (9%) had aneuploidy, four of those at repeated colonoscopies. Four of those patients also had various degrees of dysplasia. In one patient aneuploidy preceded the finding of dysplasia and in another aneuploidy preceded a well differentiated adenocarcinoma, grade Dukes' A subsequently found at surgery. Four additional patients had dysplasia, all in connection with macroscopic lesions, but were diploid. It is suggested that flow cytometric DNA analysis in long standing ulcerative colitis may be helpful in addition to histopathology in the detection of potential malignancy in ulcerative colitis.\r"

Intragastric instillation of fat increased the plasma concentration of NTLI from 45 pmol/l (34-63) in sham operated rats to 92 pmol/l (46-121) in resected rats. No significant increase in the plasma concentration of NTLI was found after intragastric instillation of amino acids or glucose. The tissue concentration of NTLI increased significantly in the jejunum and ileum after proximal small intestinal resection, while the number of immunoreactive neurotensin cells was unchanged. This study shows that the adaptive responses in the distal small intestine after proximal small intestinal resection also involve the neurotensin producing cells.\r"

After a control period of two to three hours, dogs were orally dosed with 1, 2, or 4 ml/kg of castor oil, or 0.5 g/kg magnesium citrate. Oral olive oil, 4 ml/kg, was used as control. The recording was continued for another 10 hours or until defecation occurred. Each dog showed spontaneous cyclic bursts of contractions (contractile states) at all recording sites during the control period. Contractile states migrating orad or caudad over at least half the length of the colon were called colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMC). Castor oil and magnesium citrate significantly increased the period of colonic motor complexes, but olive oil had no significant effect. None of the above substances changed the percentage of orad migrating motor complexes, as compared with the control values. Periods in which colonic motor activity was completely absent for at least 60 min over at least three consecutive recording sites occurred more frequently after all of the substances. The occurrence of these periods of inhibition, however, was not a consistent feature and there seemed to be no relationship between the occurrence of inhibitory periods and defecation during the recording period. The dogs defecated within 10 hours after administration of magnesium citrate, 1, 2, and 4 ml/kg of castor oil in 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 88.8% of experiments respectively, but never with olive oil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Studies in healthy subjects showed that 400 pmol/kg an hour of GRP induced a maximal release of gastrin. Infusion of this dose of GRP after a complete resection of the antrum and duodenal bulb induced a small, but significant increase in gastrin concentrations. After pancreaticoduodenectomy, however, GRP infusion had no effect on serum gastrin concentrations. In patients previously subjected to an incomplete antrectomy, GRP infusion was followed by a gastrin response considerably higher than after a complete antrectomy. Our results would suggest that GRP is capable of releasing gastrin predominantly from the antrum and the duodenal bulb, but also a small amount of gastrin from the remaining part of the duodenum. Gastrin releasing peptide infusion and determination of gastrin release may be of clinical significance in showing remaining significant gastrin pools in patients with recurrent ulceration after previous gastric resections.\r"

One hundred measurements on an experimental model showed the reliability of the system. Measurements on eight patients with the balloon followed immediately by the puncture technique, showed good correlation.\r"

However, when prostaglandin E1 was administered with lipopolysaccharide, remarkable improvements in the survival rate and in the histological changes of the liver were observed. In order to find out how prostaglandin E1 suppressed the induction of massive hepatic cell necrosis in this experimental model, we studied the effects of prostaglandin E1 on the activation of liver adherent cells, from which the cytotoxic factor is released, and on the protection of hepatocytes from the cytotoxic factor. As a result, prostaglandin E1 not only inhibited the activation of liver adherent cells and suppressed the release of the cytotoxic factor, but it also directly affected the hepatocytes and protected them from the cytotoxic factor.\r"

Catecholamine concentrations in rat plasma were measured at various times after hepatectomy and were found to be elevated relative to those in plasma from sham-operated rats. Surgical hepatic denervation or injection of an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist (prazosin) reduced incorporation of [3H]thymidine into liver DNA during the first 24 hr after partial hepatectomy. Chronic guanethidine injections (3 to 6 weeks) reduced liver catecholamine levels, but did not affect its ability to regenerate. The inhibition of regenerative DNA synthesis by prazosin was preceded by an alteration in the binding of epidermal growth factor to regenerating liver, which was apparently the result of an increased number of epidermal growth factor receptors. Thus, alpha 1-adrenergic blockade, which affects both epidermal growth factor receptor binding and subsequent DNA synthesis in hepatocyte primary cultures, can also modulate these processes during liver regeneration in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Rats fed chow containing finely divided elemental iron (from carbonyl-iron) develop hepatic iron overload resembling human hereditary hemochromatosis in that deposition of iron is primarily in periportal hepatocytes and with hepatic iron concentrations sufficiently high to be associated in the human disease with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. In recent studies using this model, we reported changes in hepatic hemoproteins and heme oxygenase, the rate-controlling enzyme of heme breakdown. We now report effects of iron-loading on three enzymes of heme synthesis: 5-aminolevulinate synthase; the first and rate-controlling enzyme of the pathway, 5-aminolevulinate dehydrase (or porphobilinogen synthase), and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, the activity of which is decreased in porphyria cutanea tarda, a liver disease in which iron is known to play an important but still poorly understood role. Of the three enzymes, only activity of the dehydrase was altered by iron-loading: it was decreased significantly as early as 1 week after starting iron feeding, and with marked iron overload was 30 to 32% of control values. The degree of decrease was inversely related (r = -0.77 to -0.88) to the degree of iron overload and was partially reversed within 1 to 3 days when feeding of the iron-supplemented diet was stopped. The decrease in dehydrase activity was not attributable to lack of reduced glutathione or other disulfide-reducing agents or to zinc deficiency; nor was evidence found for inhibition by iron compounds or other possible inhibitors present in iron-loaded livers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess whether an antibody response against acetaldehyde-modified protein epitopes is associated with alcoholic liver disease, the serum immunoreactivity against proteins modified in vitro by acetaldehyde and against the corresponding unmodified proteins was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 58 alcoholics with varying degrees of liver damage. Alcoholics showed significantly higher titers against protein-acetaldehyde conjugates than against the unmodified protein, independent of the nature of the carrier protein. The highest titers occurred in alcoholic hepatitis patients. Sera of patients with chronic hepatitis of nonalcoholic origin and of healthy controls also reacted with acetaldehyde conjugates, but their titers were significantly lower than those in alcoholic hepatitis patients. Our data support the idea that binding of acetaldehyde to proteins in humans generates antigenic determinants which trigger a corresponding immune response against such epitopes and suggest that this humoral immune response may be implicated in autoantibody formation and liver damage associated with excessive alcohol consumption.\r"

Frozen sections of griseofulvin-fed mouse liver and human liver of primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis were extracted by Triton X-100 and nuclease. Indirect immunofluorescent staining was performed by using anticow hoof keratin antibody for mouse liver and anti-human epidermal keratin antibody (AE1 and AE3) for human liver. Transmission electron microscopy was also performed on extracted and critical point-dried samples. The griseofulvin-fed mouse hepatoma cells showed four different types of altered staining pattern based on the indirect immunofluorescent staining of the cytoplasm and Mallory bodies: Type I--cytoplasm(+), Mallory body(-); Type II--cytoplasm(+), Mallory body(+); Type III--cytoplasm(-), Mallory body(+), and Type IV--cytoplasm(-), Mallory body(-). Types I and III were predominant, however, some hepatoma cells which contain Mallory bodies revealed bright cytoplasmic staining (Type II). The nuclear rims were strongly stained. In human liver, AE1 stained Mallory bodies and the bile duct epithelium intensely, but did not stain normal hepatocytes. AE3 mainly stained Mallory bodies and normal hepatocytes, but also stained bile duct epithelium weakly. Indirect immunofluorescent staining for human liver showed the same staining patterns as found in mouse liver, except that Type IV was not observed. Although many hepatocytes which contained Mallory bodies did not react with either of these two antibodies (Type III), some of the hepatocytes were stained, not only with AE3, but also with AE1 (Type II).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic stellate cells play a quantitatively important role in hepatic retinoid metabolism and storage in rats maintained under normal nutritional conditions. Studies were conducted to further explore the biochemical characteristics of hepatic stellate cells. Stellate cells were isolated in high purity and yield from the livers of normal rats. The isolated cells had the morphology expected (on electron micrographs) for stellate cells, and were enriched in retinoids and in the intracellular retinoid-binding proteins. The composition of the stellate cell lipid droplets was examined. These lipid droplets were isolated in high purity and integrity from frozen and thawed stellate cell preparations by differential centrifugation. We estimate that the lipid composition of stellate cell lipid droplets consisted of approximately 42% retinyl ester, 28% triglyceride, 13% cholesterol (total) and 4% phospholipid. Thus, stellate cell lipid droplets contain substantial levels of both cholesterol and triglyceride, in addition to retinyl esters. Stellate cell homogenates were assayed for both retinol-binding protein and transthyretin by specific radioimmunoassays. Within the detection limits of these radioimmunoassays, we were unable to detect the presence of either retinol-binding protein (less than 9 ng per 10(6) cells) or transthyretin (less than 11 ng per 10(6) cells) in the stellate cell preparations. Total RNA, prepared from the isolated stellate cells, was examined by Northern blot analysis for retinol-binding protein mRNA and transthyretin mRNA, using cDNA probes for retinol-binding protein and transthyretin. Within the sensitivity of these assays, retinol-binding protein mRNA and transthyretin mRNA were not detected in stellate cells. These findings suggest that stellate cells do not synthesize or accumulate retinol-binding protein.\r"

Treatment with cytochalasin B led to no significant change in the mean diameter of the fenestrae but to an increase in their number and in the porosity of the cells (percentage of the cellular surface opened by the fenestrae) which attained up to 300% of that of the controls. Scanning electron microscopic observations of Triton-extracted cells revealed that these modifications were related to an alteration of the cytoskeleton. The effect of cytochalasin B could be reversed; 3 hr after removal of the drug, the cells recovered their original aspect with sieve plates scattered over their surface. These observations demonstrate that endothelial fenestrae are inducible structures and that the cytoskeleton seems to be involved in their formation.\r"

To clarify this and to determine the role of other circulating connective tissue-related substances in children, we have measured serum concentrations of antigens related to aminopropeptide of type III procollagen, the 7S domain of type IV collagen and the P1 fragment of laminin in healthy subjects aged 1 month to 4 years and in children with Indian childhood cirrhosis, a particularly aggressive form of liver disease. In healthy subjects, there was a considerable age variation in serum aminopropeptide of type III procollagen but not in 7S collagen or laminin P1. In Indian childhood cirrhosis, all three serum antigens were increased (p less than 0.001) above the upper limit of normal for age. Both the serum 7S collagen and laminin P1 concentrations showed a significant correlation with the degree of intralobular fibrosis and also with the severity of necrosis and cellular infiltration, suggesting that these serum antigens may be a noninvasive means of assessing and monitoring events associated with hepatic fibrosis in Indian childhood cirrhosis. The raised serum aminopropeptide of type III procollagen in Indian childhood cirrhosis did not correlate with any histological parameter assessed. Gel filtration of serum showed that, in healthy subjects, the predominant antigenic form of aminopropeptide of type III procollagen was a degradation peptide smaller than authentic aminopropeptide of type III procollagen; while in Indian childhood cirrhosis the authentic peptide and a larger degradation peptide predominated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of arteriohepatic dysplasia may be difficult, particularly in very young patients with no family history, and the pathogenesis of the disorder remains obscure. It has been reported that the typical ultrastructural changes of cholestasis are scant in this condition and proposed that there is a failure of the hepatocytes to secrete bile into the canaliculi. In an attempt to expand on these observations and to test the value of ultrastructure as a differential diagnostic test for this condition, we chose two parameters felt to be associated with cholestasis that could be reliably and relatively simply determined by ultrastructural morphometry: canalicular dilatation and loss of canalicular microvilli. The values for these parameters were compared in arteriohepatic dysplasia with those in other infantile cholestatic conditions and with those in noncholestatic controls. The results of these morphometric studies corroborated the previous observation that canalicular dilatation in arteriohepatic dysplasia is minimal. There was, however, only a marginal difference in canalicular area between patients with arteriohepatic dysplasia and those with extrahepatic biliary atresia. There was significant overlap of values for canalicular area among all groups. Surprisingly, the studies showed no real loss of canalicular microvilli in any of the cholestatic conditions. The findings suggest that, at least for these two parameters, caution should be exercised in using qualitative electron microscopic evaluation as a diagnostic test for arteriohepatic dysplasia.\r"

Tissue was examined using light microscopy histochemistry, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as autoradiography and morphometry at the electron microscopic level. Autoradiography demonstrated incorporation of a glycoprotein precursor, [3H]galactose, within the membrane-bound granules localized in the supranuclear region of the epithelial cells. Exocytosis of granule contents was by merocrine secretion. Morphometry indicated a significant increase in the amount of intracellular mucin granules as early as 18 hr on the lithogenic diet, a feature that continued throughout the experimental period of 20 weeks. Mucus synthesis/secretion rates returned to control values within 3 weeks after removal from the diet. Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed a thick sludge-like layer overlying the epithelium at a time in the chronology of the cholelithiasic model that correlated well with the initial phases of stone formation. Histochemistry showed this layer to be a mixture of acidic mucins. Neutral mucins were not observed. The hypersecretion of mucus and formation of this sludge-like layer appear to be critical nucleating factors in the formation of cholesterol gallstones.\r"

We previously demonstrated the progressive accumulation of water in grey matter areas of the brain in the rabbit with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure. We now report the electron microscopic morphology of the brain in the same model of acute hepatic failure following the intravenous injection of horseradish peroxidase, an intravascular tracer which forms an electron-dense reaction product. Rabbits with both mild and severe encephalopathy had normal blood pressures and blood gases at the time of study. Fixation of brain tissue was obtained by whole-body perfusion. Marked swelling of the cytoplasm, perineuronal and perivascular processes of astrocytes were noted in cortical gray, but not white, matter areas; the other cellular components of the brain had normal morphology. Capillary endothelial cells were normal, and there was no evidence of horseradish peroxidase in endothelial cell vesicles, basement membranes or the brain parenchyma, suggesting that the blood-brain barrier was impermeable to large molecules. Histologic evidence of brain edema is seen in this model, with swelling of astrocytes as the primary manifestation of the accumulation of water. Damage to astrocytes or inhibition of their function may contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy in this model.\r"

When patients were divided into three stages without considering treatment, the median survival was 37.1 months for 37 Child's A patients, 16.2 months for 36 Child's B patients and 1.6 months for 27 Child's C patients. These results suggest that the prognosis depended on treatment given and the Child's grade. The effects of major therapeutic modalities on survival were analyzed with regard to Child's grading. Among Child's A patients, the actuarial survival rate for surgery was better than that for transcatheter arterial embolization and for arterial chemotherapy. Among Child's B patients, the survival rate for transcatheter arterial embolization was better than for other treatments. Among Child's C patients, there was no significant difference in survival rate regardless of treatment and its modality. These results suggest that surgery may be indicated as a first choice in Child's A patients, transcatheter arterial embolization in Child's B patients, and there is no effective treatment in Child's C patients. The major cause of death was hepatic failure irrespective of treatment.\r"

In 22 of the 65 cases, the hepatitis was associated with an autoimmune disease, most commonly insulin-dependent diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo. The same autoimmune diseases were present in first-degree relatives from seven families. In 36 cases, the onset of disease resembled acute viral hepatitis. Serum biochemical tests showed marked elevation in aminotransaminases and hypergammaglobulinemia. Paradoxically, serum and salivary IgA levels were often normal or low. Histologic findings were multifocal hepatic necrosis with bridging in the acute stage, and aggressive hepatitis with mononuclear cell infiltration or macronodular cirrhosis in the late stages. Serologically, apart from the presence of antiliver/kidney microsome antibody type 1, the disease was characterized by the absence of antiactin, antimitochondria and antinucleus antibodies; however, organ-specific autoantibodies were often present. The clinical course was usually severe: six patients in the acute stage presented with fulminant hepatitis, and all, except two, other patients progressed to cirrhosis. Prolonged treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants was usually effective in rendering the cirrhosis inactive. The cumulative survival rate was 51% at 14 years. We propose to call this entity \"anti-LKM1 chronic active hepatitis\" or \"autoimmune hepatitis type II\" to differentiate it from classical \"lupoid hepatitis\" or autoimmune hepatitis type I.\r"

  ".W": "The epidemiology and clinical outcome of hepatitis D viral infection in HBsAg-positive acute hepatitis, chronic liver disease, primary hepatocellular carcinoma and the symptomless carrier state was studied in Jordan. The prevalence of hepatitis D viral infection was significantly higher in patients with chronic liver disease (18/79, 23%) and acute hepatitis (17/108, 16%) than in symptomless HBsAg carriers (2/136, 2%). The highest prevalence of hepatitis D viral infection was found in patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (10/15, 67%) who were also significantly older than such patients without hepatitis D viral infection. Antihepatitis D virus IgM was detected persistently in 83% of patients with antihepatitis D virus-positive chronic liver disease and transiently in 41% of patients with acute hepatitis. A trend to increased mortality was observed in acute hepatitis D viral superinfection (25%) compared to hepatitis D viral coinfection (0%) and to antihepatitis D virus-negative HBsAg-positive acute hepatitis (4%). In patients with established chronic liver disease, however, neither survival nor histological parameters of disease activity were significantly different in the antihepatitis D virus-positive and antihepatitis D virus-negative groups. While the early stage of hepatitis D viral superinfection is associated with increased mortality, it appears that in patients with late-stage chronic liver disease, severe histological activity subsides, and survival is no longer influenced by the factor of hepatitis D viral infection. However, primary hepatocellular carcinoma appears to complicate the course of those antihepatitis D virus-positive patients surviving beyond this stage.\r"
