The severity of airway obstruction as assessed by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), maximum mid-expiratory flow rate (MMFR), and forced vital capacity (FVC) was compared with blood and sputum eosinophil counts. Although there was no relation between the blood eosinophilia and airway obstruction, an inverse relationship between the number of eosinophils in the sputum and airway flow rates was observed. Higher percentages of sputum eosinophils were associated with diminished flow rates. We believe that sputum eosinophils may be helpful in the initial assessment of severe bronchial asthma.\r"

If small intestine is lodged within the pelvic cavity, fistulization or small-bowel obstruction from fixed twisted bowel loops may occur. Also, postoperative radiation therapy is likely to permanently damage the small bowel. In order to prevent these long and short term complications, the bladder may be used as an abdominopelvic partition to exclude abdominal contents from the pelvis. When the pelvic defect is large, the space beneath the bladder is filled with a pedicle flap of greater omentum. The results of this technical approach is reported in 2 patients; uniformly good results have been seen in 10 patients. These patients had normal urinary tract function after bladder suspension as an abdominopelvic partition. Also, a benign, postoperative course and long-term, normal small-bowel function without fistulization or obstruction resulted.\r"

The indications for radiologic studies, the results, and the therapeutic regimen instituted, if any, were analyzed for each patient. We found a negligible effect on the number of aortograms and hypothesize that this is due to the fact that segmental pressures rarely pick up asymptomatic patients. The total number of cerebral arteriograms was not affected; however, the percentage of positive studies for transient ischemic attacks showing severe extracranial carotid disease increased significantly (41% to 74%). We hypothesize that the minimal effect seen on the number of carotid arteriograms was due to a trade off, i.e., the number of patients not having an arteriogram due to a normal noninvasive exam was offset by those minimally symptomatic patients picked up by noninvasive exams to have high grade disease. The total number of venograms decreased significantly and there was a significant increase in the percentage of studies that tested positive for deep venous thrombosis (33% to 46%). The proper use of the vascular lab can significantly reduce the number of normal studies performed in radiology.\r"

Our 7-year experience of treating 141 patients with a history of foreign body ingestion is reported. In 114 patients, there were 122 foreign bodies present in areas from the esophagus to the rectum, as located by plain chest and abdominal x-ray examination. In two patients, a plastic toy and the plastic cap of a razor were passed with stool a few days later. In the remaining 25 patients, nothing was found. In babies under one year of age, button batteries were the most commonly swallowed foreign bodies, while coins were the most frequently swallowed objects in children over the age of three years. Seventeen foreign bodies in the esophagus were removed: seven by balloon catheter, four endoscopically, and one by a magnet tube. Four were dislodged into the stomach. Twenty nine of the 78 items present in the stomach were button batteries and 23 of the items were removed using a magnet tube. One was removed endoscopically and 5 batteries that had moved beyond the pylorus were excreted within 48 hours. Twenty four coins in the stomach were managed conservatively. Surgical intervention was required in two patients; one patient had a previous history of pyloromyotomy, and a magnet tag measuring 1.5 cm in diameter did not pass through the pylorus for 7 weeks. The other patient had swallowed a sewing needle that moved into the descending colon and abdominal pain ensued.\r"

If the deficit does not progress, but a spinal block can be demonstrated to persist beyond the acute injury period, surgical decompression may also be indicated. When no neurologic deficit is present, the optimum approach is less clear. Complications such as infection or persistent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak may necessitate surgical repair in asymptomatic patients, as well as those with neurologic loss. The presence of copper in the spinal canal is also considered by some to be an indication for surgical intervention in both groups.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become an acceptable alternative to open gastrostomy since its inception in 1981. The PEG procedure has been assumed by most to have lesser associated morbidity and mortality and to be more cost effective. Only a few studies have compared the two procedures, and even fewer cost comparisons have been performed. A review of the literature and a retrospective study was performed over a three-year period examining eighty-eight consecutive patients who underwent either PEG (48) or gastrostomy (4) for feeding purposes only by the same group of surgeons. Patients undergoing PEG or gastrostomy tube placement in association with other procedures were excluded from the study. The results of our experiences with PEG versus open gastrostomy revealed no difference in age or gender. Intraoperative morbidity was higher (50%) for PEG than for gastrostomy (2.5%). Six-month follow-up mortality was 30 per cent and 32 per cent for PEG and gastrostomy. The cost for PEG ($1360) was approximately half the cost for gastrostomy ($2448). This study demonstrates that PEG has a significantly higher intraoperative morbidity rate relative to open gastrostomy, whereas both carry a substantial percentage of late complications. Problems often encountered with PEG included suture breakage, inadvertent colon puncture, local peritonitis, and inability to keep the stomach inflated. Late complications seen with open gastrostomy were wound infection, wound dehiscence, and respiratory complications. No deaths were a direct result of either procedure, and long-term mortality rates were comparable. PEG was clearly more cost effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SETTING: Adult echocardiography laboratory in a tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Sequential sample of 408 patients presenting for clinical echocardiographic studies who had technically satisfactory studies and were available for auscultation. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Valvular regurgitation occurred in 43% of patients at the mitral valve, 39% of patients at the tricuspid valve, 33% of patients at the aortic valve, and 15% of patients at the pulmonic valve. Corresponding regurgitant murmurs were frequently absent. A murmur corresponding to Doppler-detected regurgitation was detected in 56% of patients with mitral regurgitation, 61% of patients with aortic regurgitation, 28% of patients with tricuspid regurgitation, and 15% of patients with pulmonic regurgitation. There was a highly significant positive correlation of audibility with severity of valve regurgitation for the aortic, tricuspid, and mitral valves. Audibility ranged from 10% to 40% for mild regurgitation to 86% to 100% for severe regurgitation. Murmur audibility was not related to the type of valvular disease present. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler echocardiography is a sensitive method for detecting valve regurgitation. Corresponding regurgitant murmurs are frequently not present. The audibility of regurgitant murmur is highly dependent on the severity of valve regurgitant and has little relation to the type of valve disease present.\r"

DESIGN: Comparison of diagnosis made before biopsy by one physician on the basis of a noninvasive work-up (history, physical examination, laboratory values, and imaging studies) and final diagnosis made after biopsy by a second physician formulated after review of all available noninvasive information and study of the biopsy specimen. SETTING: Referral-based gastroenterology clinic at a U.S. Navy medical center. PATIENTS: Sequential sample of 107 patients with elevated liver-associated enzymes for a minimum of 3 months. Ninety patients were eligible for study. INTERVENTIONS: The final diagnosis made by the second physician blinded to the first clinician's diagnosis served as the criterion standard. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Four diagnostic groups were selected for analysis: Alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver, chronic necroinflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous. The positive predictive value of the prebiopsy diagnosis ranged from 88% (CI, 75% to 100%) for alcoholic liver disease to 56% (CI, 37% to 75%) for fatty liver. Higher elevations of transaminase values (greater than three times the upper limit of normal) correlated positively with increased prebiopsy diagnostic accuracy. Fatty liver was present in 19% of the cohort. Liver diseases requiring specific therapy other than alcohol abstinence were overlooked and diagnosed only after review of the biopsy in five cases. Conversely, four cases of liver disease, thought to require specific therapy on the basis of noninvasive work-up, were ruled out by biopsy. CONCLUSION: The cause of chronic liver disease is best elucidated when the noninvasive work-up is complemented by review of a biopsy specimen.\r"

INTERVENTIONS: Patients received a 4-month course of recombinant human alpha-interferon (alfa-2b) beginning at a dose of 5 million units administered subcutaneously each day. RESULTS: Serum levels of HBV DNA decreased in all patients and fell to undetectable levels during treatment in four of five patients. In the four responding patients, serum HBeAg disappeared, aminotransferases fell into the normal range, and a follow-up liver biopsy showed an improvement in the hepatocyte necrosis and inflammation. Urine protein excretion also decreased during treatment. In the four responding patients, urine protein excretion gradually fell to less than 1 g/d and serum albumin levels rose into the normal range. Resolution of the biochemical and serologic evidence of chronic hepatitis and glomerulonephritis was accompanied by disappearance of signs and symptoms of liver and kidney disease.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether parathyroid hormone-related protein is synthesized and secreted by the tumor cells of patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Convenience sample of three patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Two patients developed hypercalcemia, and one patient was normocalcemic. SETTING: Inpatient facilities at two university-affiliated medical centers. INTERVENTION: All patients had a lymph node biopsy. In addition, samples of ascitic or pleural fluid, or both, were obtained from these patients. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Using RNA blot analysis, we showed that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were constitutively expressed in the tumor cells from all patients. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production-stimulating activity, assessed using osteoblast-like UMR106 cells, was demonstrated in the pleural and ascitic fluids from the two patients who developed hypercalcemia. The elution profiles of the cAMP production-stimulating activity in the ascitic fluid extracts were very similar to those of the tumor extracts from hypercalcemic nude rats that had been implanted with a human cancer tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Parathyroid hormone-related protein is produced by tumor cells in adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, which may be an important factor in the development of hypercalcemia in the patients with this disease. However, the development of hypercalcemia may depend on other factors such as the number of tumor cells, access of the protein into systemic circulation, and the presence of some additional substances.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess whether decisions about \"do-not-resuscitate\" (DNR) orders are made equitably in patients with different diseases but similar prognoses. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Three teaching hospitals: a university referral center, a county hospital serving a largely indigent population, and a Veterans Administration hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with any of the four following discharge diagnoses: the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (100 patients); unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (51 patients); cirrhosis with esophageal varices (51 patients); and severe congestive heart failure with coronary artery disease (115 patients). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Do-not-resuscitate orders were written for 52% of patients with AIDS and 47% of patients with cancer but for only 16% of patients with cirrhosis and 5% of patients with congestive heart failure (P less than 0.0001). Although DNR orders were associated with functional and mental status, reason for admission, and severity of illness, the strong association between DNR orders and disease category persisted after adjustment for these potential confounders by multiple logistic regression. A survey of housestaff showed that DNR orders were discussed more frequently with patients who had AIDS or lung cancer than with patients who had cirrhosis or heart failure, despite an accurate understanding of the generally similar prognoses among the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively similar prognoses, patients with AIDS or lung cancer are much more likely to receive DNR orders than patients with cirrhosis or severe congestive heart failure. This discrepancy cannot be explained by differences in severity of illness among patients or by misunderstandings of prognosis by clinicians. From our data, we cannot determine if patients with cirrhosis or heart failure receive too few DNR orders or if patients with AIDS or lung cancer receive too many. Our findings should encourage physicians to determine the preferences of patients about life-sustaining treatments more equitably.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To measure spinal and peripheral bone mineral densities in patients with acromegaly. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care center. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four patients with acromegaly and 24 case controls. Seventeen patients (12 eugonadal and 5 hypogonadal) had \"active\" disease as indicated by elevated plasma concentrations of growth hormone or somatomedin C or both at the time of the study. Seven patients (all hypogonadal) had inactive disease by these criteria. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bone mineral was measured by single photon absorptiometry of the forearm and dual photon absorptiometry of the spine. The forearm bone mineral content of patients with active disease, regardless of gonadal status, was significantly higher than that of normal subjects (P less than 0.001) or of patients with inactive disease (P less than 0.001). The disease \"activity\" (17.2 +/- 3.7; CI, 9.5 to 24.9) and the sex of the patient (female, -16.6 +/- 3.4; CI, -23.7 to -9.5) were the only independent predictors of forearm measurements. Vertebral bone densities were lower in acromegalic patients than in normal subjects (P less than 0.001). Vertebral values were correlated with the gonadal status of the patients (hypogonadism, -0.126 +/- 0.056; CI, -0.244 to -0.009) and with serum calcium concentrations (0.592 +/- 0.274; CI, 0.032 to 1.153) but not with acromegalic activity. In 13 patients, forearm bone was measured before and after treatment (mean duration of follow-up, 3.4 years). Patients with persistently elevated, plasma somatomedin C concentrations at the end of the study period showed a mean annual increase of 1.5% in forearm measurements during the period of observation, whereas patients with normal concentrations showed a mean annual decrease of 1.0% (P less than 0.01 for the difference between the groups). The percent change in forearm bone mineral content per year (y) was highly correlated with residual somatomedin C activity (x): y = 2.023x - 2.75; r = 0.665. CONCLUSIONS: Forearm and vertebral bone mineral measurements change in opposite directions in acromegaly. The high forearm values are attributable to the growth-promoting action of growth hormone and somatomedin C, whereas low vertebral values are associated with hypogonadism.\r"

  ".W": "The safety and efficacy of long-term amiodarone therapy were examined in 12 patients who had previously developed torsade de pointes as a complication of previous antiarrhythmic therapy. The QTc intervals were determined at the time of torsade de pointes (570 +/- 40 ms), after 7 days of amiodarone loading (490 +/- 70 ms), and after 3 months of chronic amiodarone administration (580 +/- 80 ms). Compared to a drug-free control period, QTc was significantly prolonged (P less than 0.05) at the time of torsade de pointes, after amiodarone loading, and after 3 months of amiodarone therapy. The QTc intervals at the time of torsade de pointes and after chronic amiodarone treatment were not significantly different. At 16 +/- 7 months of follow-up, all patients remained free of subsequent torsade de pointes, syncope, or sudden death. In addition, 5 of 6 patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia remained free from arrhythmic recurrence despite persistence of inducible ventricular tachycardia during programmed stimulation studies done before discharge. We conclude that amiodarone can often be used safely and effectively in patients who have previously had an episode of drug-mediated torsade de pointes. Amiodarone-induced QTc prolongation, even when marked, does not predict recurrent torsade de pointes. These observations also suggest that the propensity for a drug to produce this arrhythmia is dependent on other electrophysiologic effects in addition to its ability to simply lengthen repolarization.\r"

We examined the number of subspecialty fellows since 1976, paying particular attention to data collected in the 1987-1988 academic year. The number of fellows in subspecialty training at a given time has increased by 27% since 1976; however, much of this increase is due to the increased length of the training programs. The number of first-year fellows has increased only 7% since 1976. Growth in the number of fellowships has varied by subspecialty. The number of fellowships in geriatrics, critical care, and general internal medicine has increased dramatically. Additionally, the traditional subspecialties-cardiology, pulmonary disease, gastroenterology, infectious diseases, rheumatology, and allergy-immunology-have all grown to some extent. Program directors in all subspecialties anticipate continued growth in the coming years.\r"

Corneal sensation must be tested in all instances of suspicious head pain or paresthesia, head trauma, cranial nerve defect, cranial autonomic dysfunction, or unexplained corneal epithelial defect.

A minimum of 2 years' follow-up was available in 48 patients who underwent a temporal lobe resection. In this group, 19 patients (40%) were greatly improved, and of these 14 (29%) became seizure free and 5 (10%) had no more than 3 seizures each year. Another 22 patients (46%) showed a worthwhile reduction in seizure frequency of at least 50%. Seven patients (15%) were not significantly improved. An etiological factor of early convulsions before age 3 (usually febrile) was associated with a better outcome. Both the lack of a strong predominance for SDEEG-recorded seizures to arise in the resected temporal lobe and the presence of residual epileptiform abnormalities in the postexcision electrocorticogram were correlated with poorer results.\r"

This drug temporarily depleted dopamine and norepinephrine, as measured by a reduction in the metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylethyleneglycol (MHPG). Saccadic, pursuit, and vestibulo-ocular eye movements were recorded using infrared oculography with subjects both on placebo and on metyrosine. The most consistent effect observed with metyrosine was an increase in the amplitude and frequency of saccadic intrusions during fixation and pursuit. Two of the 3 subjects also had shortened time constants for the vestibulo-ocular reflex, attributable in part to the sedative effect of catecholamine depletion. The increase in saccadic intrusions implies that catecholamines modulate the activity of a subpopulation of suppressor motor neurons in the human brainstem.\r"

In AD, there was global cerebral atrophy of both cortex and white matter, selective atrophy of the amygdala and hippocampus, and ex vacuo hydrocephalus. In addition, in half the cases of AD, white matter atrophy was associated with overt histopathological evidence of patchy rarefaction of fibers and gliosis. Patients with preclinical AD had prominent and selective shrinkage of white matter comparable to that observed in AD, yet their cortical areas were normal. These observations suggest that white matter degeneration is an intrinsic component of AD. Moreover, its presence in preclinical AD where cortical atrophy is not evident indicates that cytoskeletal abnormalities associated with axonal degeneration may precede and perhaps cause the cortical atrophy observed in clinically manifested AD.\r"

There were 18 patients who had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 18 who had AIDS-related complex (ARC), and 20 who were HIV antibody-seropositive but otherwise asymptomatic (HIV-Ab+). The SRT task consisted of 5 trials, each containing 10 target stimuli. The CRT task consisted of 10 trials, each containing 5 target stimuli randomly interspersed with 5 nontarget stimuli. The mean response latency of each of the patient groups on the SRT task was not significantly different from that of controls. However, the performance of patients with AIDS or ARC on the CRT task was significantly lower than that of controls, whereas that of HIV-Ab+ patients was not. Analysis of the quality of RT task performance also indicated that the impairment of processing efficiency at higher levels of task difficulty reflected a disruption of processing prior to the response selection stage.\r"

The tongue size in ALS, as measured in the sagittal plane, can be reduced by as much as two-thirds of normal. The shape of the tongue in ALS tends to be rectangular or square rather than curved as is normal. As severity of the disease increases, the position of the tongue changes so that the bulk of the muscle falls away from the incisors and no longer is in contact with the hard or soft palate. The normal radial bands from the anterior floor of the mouth to the mucosal surface are often missing in ALS as are the two curvilinear bands that run parallel to the mucosal surface and intersect the radial bands. Also, there is a mottled disorganization of the internal structure of the tongue with areas of increased and decreased signal intensity.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of continuous and intermittent levodopa treatment on behavioral and biochemical indexes of basal ganglia function were compared in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway. Animals treated for 30 days with intermittent levodopa exhibited behavioral sensitization manifested by an enhanced rotational response to apomorphine; the rotational response of rats treated with an equivalent dose of levodopa by continuous infusion did not differ from that of saline-treated controls. Dopamine receptor up-regulation in the denervated striatum relative to the intact striatum was statistically significant for D1 but not D2 receptors: This asymmetry in dopamine receptor levels was diminished following intermittent levodopa treatment. Glutamic acid decarboxylase activity, modestly elevated in all groups in the denervated striatum relative to the intact striatum, increased substantially over control values bilaterally as a result of intermittent, but not continuous, levodopa treatment. These findings suggest a relation between the schedule of chronic levodopa administration and the development of behavioral sensitization, possibly as a consequence of alterations in neuronal systems located downstream from striatal dopamine receptors. The behavioral sensitization induced by chronic, intermittent dopaminomimetic treatment may serve as a model for motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease.\r"

In muscle mitochondria, activities of both short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) were 35% of normal. Antibodies against purified SCAD, MCAD, and electron-transfer flavoprotein were used for detection of cross-reacting material (CRM) in the patient's mitochondria. Western blot analysis showed absence of SCAD-CRM, reduced amounts of MCAD-CRM, and normal amounts of electron-transfer flavoprotein-CRM. The patient, who was unresponsive to treatment with oral carnitine, improved dramatically with daily administration of 100 mg oral riboflavin. Increase in muscle bulk and strength and resolution of the organic aciduria were associated with normalization of SCAD activity and \"reappearance\" of SCAD-CRM. In contrast, both MCAD activity and MCAD-CRM remained lower than normal. These results suggest that in some patients with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency riboflavin supplementation may be effective in restoring the activity of SCAD, and possibly of other mitochondrial flavin-dependent enzymes.\r"

Risk of AD was assessed in 967 first-degree relatives of 128 probands with clinically diagnosed AD and 572 first-degree relatives of a control group consisting of 84 subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). Using a method that weights likelihood of correct diagnosis of AD, cumulative risk among AD relatives by age 93 was 24%, whereas relatives of the PD probands had a weighted risk of 16% by age 90. Overall, the total lifetime risk of developing dementia was similar among first-degree relatives of patients with AD and those of patients with PD. The age-specific risks were much different, however; from the age of 65 years to the age of 80 years, relatives of patients with AD had a twofold to fourfold increased risk of dementia. Equal risks were found for parents and siblings and for male and female relatives after adjustment for sex-specific patterns of survivorship. Relatives of probands with early-onset (less than or equal to 67 years) and late-onset (greater than 67 years) AD had equivalent risks of developing illness. Because onset age was found to cluster in families, the apparent increase in cumulative incidence for dementia in relatives of early-onset cases was likely due to relatives of the late-onset cases dying before developing illness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89372740\r", 
  ".W": "T-lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis are predominantly CD4+ (inducer) as opposed to CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cells. The CD4+ lymphocytes can be subdivided into populations that express high densities of the CDw29 (4B4) determinant and have helper inducer function or express high densities of CD45R (2H4) determinant and have suppressor inducer function. In the present study, we characterized the nature of these CD4+ T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis by performing flow cytometric analysis on paired samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. There were significantly lower percentages of CD4+2H4+ T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid than in the peripheral blood (p = 0.001, paired t test). In contrast, there were increased percentages of helper inducer (CD4+4B4+) T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (p = 0.001, paired t test), compared with the peripheral blood. Analysis of subjects with other inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system did not show significant decreases in CD4+2H4+ T cells in cerebrospinal fluid, though in some, decreases were also observed. These results indicate that the CD4+ T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis are predominantly helper inducer, as opposed to suppressor inducer T cells, and that the relative decrease of suppressor inducer cells in the peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis patients is not due to their migration to the cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, the increased numbers of helper inducer cells in the cerebrospinal fluid may contribute to local autoimmune processes in the central nervous system compartment of multiple sclerosis patients.\r"

Metabolic rates were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in patients on carbamazepine in 6 of 20 regions of interest (3 left cerebral hemisphere, 3 right).

The mean (+/- SEM) variation for control regions of interest was 1 +/- 1%. This study showed that carbamazepine depresses cerebral glucose metabolism as much as phenytoin does, but much less than phenobarbital does. The difference in effect on lCMRGlc may be related to drug mechanisms of action, as well as to effects on memory, learning, mood, and behavior.\r"

The ability of levodopa to induce dyskinesias and alleviate parkinsonism has generally been considered a continuous dose-dependent pharmacological spectrum. In this study, the acute dose-response profile of intravenously administered levodopa for both inducing dyskinesia and alleviating parkinsonism, and its duration of action on these motor manifestations were evaluated in 52 parkinsonian patients. The minimum dose of levodopa required to produce mild dyskinetic movements was significantly lower in patients with fluctuations in motor response compared with those who had a stable response to standard oral therapy; the minimum dose for antiparkinsonian benefit, however, failed to show significant differences. The rate of disappearance of dyskinetic movements was faster than the rate of reappearance of parkinsonian signs following withdrawal of a steady-state infusion of levodopa. The dissociation of the pharmacodynamic profile of the two major motor effects of levodopa suggests their mediation through two different central pharmacological mechanisms, perhaps involving the two classes of dopamine receptors or other transmitter systems, and could have important implications for the design of future antiparkinsonian agents.\r"

The results are consistent with the view that the anatomy of the corpus callosum, while clearly influenced by nongenetic factors, is under considerable genetic control.\r"

This study revealed a decrease of about 40% (p less than 0.01 or p less than 0.05) in neuronal number and a shrinkage of both pigmented and nonpigmented neurons in the substantia nigra in HD. Pigmented neuron number was decreased markedly in the ventral cell group. Loss of the neurons occurred in the medial and lateral thirds, but relative sparing of the neurons was seen in the central part of the substantia nigra. In contrast, loss of nonpigmented neurons was relatively uniform in the substantia nigra although it was more severe in the central part. We conclude that a primary neuronal degeneration occurs in the substantia nigra in HD.\r"

One group consisting of monkeys that died less than 48 hours after the hypoxia, and the other of those that survived 7 to 13 days following the insult. The quantification of lipid-containing cells was undertaken in frozen brain sections stained with Oil red O; sections of brains from 4 perfusion-fixed animals were evaluated by electron microscopy. Lipid-containing cells were found in the corpus callosum, in the septum, and in periventricular white matter in both posthypoxic and control animals. There was a relationship between numbers of lipid-containing cells and the age of the animal; animals with large numbers were less than 28 days old. Decreases in numbers of lipid-containing cells correlated with advancing myelination as well as with age. Electron microscopic evaluation revealed lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of cells with irregularly shaped nuclei, densely clumped chromatin, occasional microtubules, and narrow cytoplasmic processes. We suggest that lipid-containing cells in the white matter of the brains of infants are related to age and to maturational factors and, in the absence of other pathologic signs, are not related to prior hypoxic injury.\r"

In Parkinson's disease, the percentages of neurons, from the medial to the lateral part of the substantia nigra, were reduced to 49%, 31%, 41%, and 25% of the control values. The number of neurons in the lateral part showed a negative correlation with the severity of rigidity and hypokinesia, whereas tremor was less noticeable in patients with few neurons. The degree of dementia of the patients had a significant correlation only with neuronal loss in the medial part of the substantia nigra, suggesting, in view of the topographical organization of the neurons in the substantia nigra, that intact projections to the caudate nucleus and limbic and cortical areas are a prerequisite for normal cognitive functioning and that their dysfunction leads to clinical dementia.\r"

They represented one-fifth of all benign age- and localization-related idiopathic epilepsies seen. Some patients were followed as long as 15 years. There was a preponderance in females and peak age at onset of epilepsy was 5 years. In 16 children, the seizures were infrequent and sometimes prolonged and consisted mainly of tonic deviation of the eyes and vomiting, often with evolution to unilateral or generalized convulsions. Seizures were only nocturnal in 11 and nocturnal and diurnal in another 5 children. Prognosis was excellent; 5 children had only one fit. Remission usually occurred 1 to 2 years after onset and no seizures occurred after the age of 12 years. The remaining 2 children had frequent diurnal episodes consisting of visual hallucinations, postictal headache, and occasional nocturnal hemiconvulsions. Their prognosis was less favorable. Electroencephalographic abnormalities in all 18 patients consisted of repetitive spike and slow-wave discharges confined to the occipital regions and attenuated when the eyes were open. These outlasted clinical remission for many years, sometimes up to the age of 16. Fixation-off sensitivity was demonstrated frequently. Based on these findings, a unifying definition for benign childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms is proposed.\r"

Recent theories on the neurochemical cause for hepatic encephalopathy have implicated activation of inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA systems. In 20 patients with hepatic disease, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of ammonia and amino acids were measured. As in previous studies there was a selective elevation of CSF amino acids as well as a correlation between CSF glutamine levels and encephalopathy. CSF DBI levels were maximally elevated 5-fold in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, but they were normal in those patients with liver disease not associated with changes in mental status and in patients with nonhepatic encephalopathy. Levels of DBI correlated with the clinical staging of hepatic encephalopathy. These data suggest that DBI may participate in the modulation of cerebral function in hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

To test whether ethylene oxide retained in the dialyzers might be neurotoxic, tissue culture medium was incubated in the blood compartment of dialyzers. Embryonic rat dorsal root ganglion neurons were then incubated in this medium for up to 5 days. During the first 24 hours axonal growth was normal. During the next 24-hour period varicosities appeared on axons, and after 4 days neuron cell bodies died. The pattern of degeneration was identical to that observed when cultures were exposed to an atmosphere containing 1 ppm ethylene oxide gas. Culture medium introduced into dialyzers after routine prerinsing still caused degeneration, which was not completely abolished even by a 10-liter rinse. When medium was exposed to identical dialyzers sterilized by gamma irradiation, no changes were seen in culture. Identical morphological changes were produced by using dialysis patient serum in the culture medium in place of the usual calf bovine serum. Such changes were never seen with control human serum. Since ethylene oxide is toxic to the human peripheral nervous system, it is proposed that ethylene oxide in dialyzers may contribute to the progressive neuropathy observed in patients on long-term hemodialysis.\r"

Cerebral transient ischemic attacks had occurred in 9 of these patients but no case of stroke was found. A striking feature of these patients was that 41% had headache or orbital pain accompanying their amaurotic spells and an additional 25.3% had severe headaches independent of the visual loss. Results of laboratory studies were rarely abnormal and echocardiography disclosed that only 1 patient had previously unknown heart disease. Mitral valve prolapse was detected in 6.5%, a figure similar to that expected for the general population. Of the original 83 patients, 42 were reexamined after a mean period of 5.8 years. None of the patients in this group had had a stroke, and the clinical status at follow-up was not found to correlate with the duration of the visual loss (amaurosis fugax versus ocular infarction), frequency (single versus recurrent episodes), sex, presence of headache or heart disease, cigarette smoking, use of oral contraceptives, or abnormal findings on echocardiograms or laboratory studies. We conclude that amaurosis fugax and ocular infarction occurring in the younger patient are probably associated with a more benign clinical course than that seen in older persons and that migraine is a likely cause for the episodes of visual loss in a majority of this group. Because of this, we believe that a conservative approach to the evaluation of such patients seems warranted.\r"

Their clinical features were similar to the Westphal variant (usually seen in juvenile-onset HD) but they had onset in adult life, and in contrast to juvenile-onset HD, their course of illness was prolonged. Most family members had been repeatedly misdiagnosed during life because of the absence of chorea and prominence of long-tract signs. In 2 patients who died, neuropathological examination at autopsy revealed prominent involvement of brainstem and spinal cord structures, and in 1, mild neostriatal atrophy relative to duration of the disease. The study demonstrates the usefulness of genetic linkage analysis as a diagnostic tool in families with atypical forms of HD. This method allows study of phenotypic variations that can be inherited at or near the HD locus and implies either multiple alleles at the locus gene, modifiers of a single allele, or another locus in the same region causing a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease.\r"

The incidence of this phenomenon is probably 1 in 370 to 1 in 1,110 in the general epileptic population but may be even higher in the 20- to 40-year age group, and still higher if epileptics with symptomatic epilepsy are selected. Sudden unexpected death in epileptics has been observed at least once weekly by the Office of the Medical Examiner of Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, for many years. A year-long prospective study revealed that victims of this complication of epilepsy are most commonly black males averaging 35 years of age who have infrequent generalized seizures and usually have some structural lesion in the brain responsible for their seizures. They tend to abuse alcohol and have poor compliance with anticonvulsant medication. The electroencephalograms display considerable variability from record to record. At autopsy the heart, lung, and liver weights were heavier and the brain weights were lighter than expected. The mechanisms involved in sudden unexpected death in epileptics may include autonomically mediated cardiac arrhythmia alone or in combination with sudden \"neurogenic\" pulmonary edema and \"backward\" cardiac failure.\r"

A probe derived from Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) detected viral RNA within mononuclear cells of the interstitial connective tissue in 3 of 5 patients with adult-onset DM. None of these patients showed positive hybridization to probes derived from human EVs (poliovirus type 1 and Coxsackie virus B3) applied to subjacent sections of the same biopsies. The remaining 2 adult DM patients, 4 patients with childhood-onset DM, and 24 non-DM patients did not react with either TMEV or human enterovirus probes. Histochemical stains for esterase and immunoperoxidase stains for Mac-1 antigen in the 3 DM patients who reacted positively revealed positive cells in the same distribution as, but in far greater number than, those positive by in situ hybridization. Immunoperoxidase staining for HLA-DR antigens revealed positive cells in the same distribution and number as were seen with the TMEV probe. We conclude that an EV-like agent, more closely related to TMEV than to human EVs, may be associated with DM and that this agent is probably localized within muscle macrophages that express class II major histocompatibility complex antigens.\r"

Using [32P]8N3GTP we demonstrate that the exchangeable GTP site of the beta subunit of tubulin is available to added guanine nucleotide in normal aged brain homogenates, whereas it is variably unavailable in Alzheimer's diseased brain. Inability of 8N3GTP to photolabel beta tubulin appears to be associated with neurofibrillary tangle density.

  ".W": "We recorded pattern-reversal electroretinograms, flash electroretinograms, pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials, and flash visual evoked potentials in 6 patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and 6 age- and sex-matched control subjects. The mean amplitude of the pattern-reversal electroretinogram in the Alzheimer patients was significantly less than that of the control group (p = 0.004). This anomaly of the pattern-reversal electroretinogram may be a reflection of documented axonal depletion within the optic nerve and the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells seen in Alzheimer's disease. We found Alzheimer patients to have normal pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials and flash electroretinograms, but a delayed second positive component of the flash visual evoked potential. This combination of findings may be of diagnostic import in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type frequently have difficulty performing visual tasks. These difficulties may be due, at least partially, to degenerative changes in both the primary visual pathway and the visual association areas. To determine whether retinal ganglion cell dysfunction contributes to visual loss in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, we tested a group of patients with this disease (n = 13) using the pattern-reversal electroretinogram to both low (4.0 reversals per second) and high (16.0 reversals per second) temporal frequency checkerboard patterns (1.0 degree checks). Significant amplitude reductions were noted for the patients relative to age-matched control subjects (n = 30). In addition, the observed amplitude reductions were most pronounced for the high temporal frequency condition. Therefore, the results are consistent with retinal ganglion cell dysfunction and support the notion that optic nerve damage induced by senile dementia of the Alzheimer type preferentially affects the larger, faster-conducting retinal ganglion cells along with their retinocortical projections.\r"

  ".W": "Apomorphine, a potent dopamine agonist, has been used in acute and chronic studies of parkinsonism and other neurological disorders. To define its peripheral pharmacokinetics, we administered apomorphine by subcutaneous injection, by subcutaneous infusion, and by intravenous infusion to 15 patients with parkinsonism and measured plasma apomorphine levels by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The peak drug levels and area under the curve were closely correlated with the dose administered; time to peak was brief and was independent of dose. The variation in absorption was high between subjects but low within individual subjects. In 11 of 15 subjects, the disappearance of drug could be described by a two-compartment model, with a distribution half-life of 5 minutes and an elimination half-life of 33 minutes. The drug absorption, volume of distribution, plasma clearance, and half-lives were similar for subcutaneous injection, subcutaneous infusion, and intravenous infusion. We conclude that apomorphine is rapidly and completely absorbed from subcutaneous tissue, correlating with the rapid onset of clinical effects, and that the brief duration of clinical action of the drug is explained by its rapid clearance.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients in the chronic progressive stage of multiple sclerosis were studied prospectively with magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neurological examination every 2 weeks for 6 months. There were no clinical relapses and disability ratings did not change between the start and completion of the study. Despite the clinical inactivity, a total of 86 active events (new, reappearing, or enlarging lesions) were identified by magnetic resonance imaging over the 6 months, with 50 (51%) of 98 follow-up scans showing evidence of one or more active lesions. New and changing lesions were indistinguishable in appearance, distribution, and temporal pattern from those previously seen in patients who had relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis. However, as noted previously, the patients in the chronic progressive stage had many more confluent lesions than did the group in relapse. These results strongly suggest that the frequently observed clinical evolution of multiple sclerosis into a chronic progressive course is not accompanied by a fundamental change in the disease process. In fact the chronic progressive stage seems associated with more active changes demonstrated by scans than does relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis. This study also confirms our previous experience that serial magnetic resonance imaging is much more sensitive than clinical examination in detecting disease activity in multiple sclerosis.\r"

Clinical signs occur months to several years after recovery from acute measles infection. It is not known where the virus persists while the disease is inapparent. Involvement of organs outside the central nervous system has rarely been documented. To search for possible peripheral reservoirs of measles virus we used in situ hybridization to probe for measles virus RNA and immunocytochemical studies to localize measles virus antigens ina variety of organs taken at autopsy from confirmed cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Seven of 9 cadavers were found to contain measles virus RNA or antigens, or both, in at least one location outside the central nervous system. These sites included lymphoid organs such as thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and tonsil, suggesting a role for lymphocytes in disease pathogenesis. Virus was also detected in kidney, lung, and glandular tissues such as pancreas, adrenal, and pituitary. These reservoirs may provide the antigenic stimulus leading to the elevated response characteristic for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.\r"

Antiserum to T alpha 1 stained the cell body, but not the processes, of GFAP-positive astrocytes, suggesting that T alpha 1 is a common antigen shared between thymus and astrocytes. Because T alpha 1 and its precursor molecule play a role in cell proliferation and immunomodulation, our findings could explain the role of astrocytes in certain central nervous system diseases.\r"

We studied the P450-mediated metabolism of acetaminophen to 3-hydroxy-acetaminophen in 26 patients with Parkinson's disease and in 18 control subjects. After subjects ingested 1,000 mg acetaminophen, urine was collected under controlled conditions. Acetaminophen and 3-hydroxy-acetaminophen were measured in the urine using newly developed high-pressure liquid chromatography methods. The ratio of 3-hydroxy-acetaminophen to acetaminophen was calculated for each patient and no significant differences were observed in patients compared with control subjects. Abnormal metabolism was not observed in patients who had onset of Parkinson's disease at or before the age of 40. In addition, no difference in metabolic activity was observed between the patients who were treated with levodopa/carbidopa and those who were not treated. These findings suggest that there are no alterations of P450-mediated metabolism of acetaminophen in patients with Parkinson's disease.\r"

The joint sensitivity of aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin values in detecting abnormal results from a biopsy specimen obtained after treatment was .86; the predictive value of negative test results was .93. A logistic regression model significantly predicted the presence of abnormal (grade III or higher) liver biopsy specimen results. The concordance index was .92 (perfect, 1.0). Regression coefficients may be used along with information from a specific patient to calculate the predicted probability of an abnormal result from a liver biopsy specimen after treatment. We conclude that this multivariate risk estimation model significantly predicts the likelihood of positive findings from liver biopsy specimens in this patient population. The clinical use of this model awaits further validation.\r"

Of 83 patients receiving biopsies before methotrexate treatment, 14 had one or more risk factors predictive of liver abnormality but they had normal pretreatment biopsy specimens. Among 17 patients with abnormal biopsy specimens before methotrexate treatment, only 1 had an identifiable risk factor and 5 had abnormal results of liver function tests. The probability of a normal biopsy specimen after methotrexate treatment dropped below 50% at a cumulative methotrexate dose of 3115 mg for the 31 patients with biopsy specimens from before and after methotrexate treatment and 5776 mg for those who had biopsies only after methotrexate treatment; this difference was statistically significant and is thought to be related to the fact that the patients who had biopsies before and after methotrexate treatment had received most of their medication by the parenteral rather than the oral route. A significant association existed between biopsy grade after methotrexate treatment and obesity. Other risk factors were not correlated with biopsy grade. Blood chemistry tests were not predictive of histopathologic findings. Eight of 11 patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis showed meaningful improvement in liver histologic findings after methotrexate treatment had been withdrawn for 6 months or more; none had progression of abnormalities.\r"

Oil and lotion vehicles with bergapten/UV-B sunscreen or sunscreen alone were applied to the backs of subjects twice weekly for 4 weeks and the subjects were exposed to gradually increasing doses of midday sunlight. The degree of skin darkening was assessed by clinical examination, reflectometry, and light microscopy of skin biopsy specimens. At 5 weeks, 1 week after the last sunlight exposure, the sites treated with either the bergapten/UV-B sunscreen lotion or the lotion vehicle were significantly darker than the sites treated with the sunscreen lotions without bergapten. Oil preparations produced less clearcut results, possibly because of a less potent sunscreen or because the bergapten did not leave the vehicle and absorb into the epidermis. In type I skin, the bergapten/sunscreen and the oil vehicle alone produced the same amount of tanning; both yielded more tanning than the sunscreen in oil by clinical examination. The findings were not confirmed by reflectometry or by light microscopy. Thus, we conclude that bergapten added to a UV-B sunscreen lotion preparation can increase skin pigmentation over the sunscreen alone when one is exposed to sunlight. The bergapten/UV-B sunscreen combination is a potentially useful product since one can develop a psoralen and UV-A-induced tan while being protected from UV-B-induced sunburn by the UV-B sunscreen incorporated into the formulation.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 31 infants and children with acute duodenal ulcer verified by endoscopy was studied over an eight year period. Eighteen (58%) of them were under 2 years of age. The most common symptom was upper gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 27, 87%). Twenty nine patients (94%) had a preceding illness characterised by diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, or fever, which was not necessarily treated with antipyretic drugs. Initial endoscopy showed that ulcer lesions were solitary in 14 patients and present on the anterior wall (n = 11), posterior wall (n = 2), or both (n = 1). Multiple ulcers were found in 17 patients, and present in the bulb with (n = 6) or without (n = 11) extension into the second part of duodenum. The most conspicuous finding was the irregularly shaped ulcers seen in eight young children with similar clinical and endoscopic features. Sixteen patients were re-endoscoped one to two weeks after the initial examination; the ulcers had entirely disappeared in 13, and there were only small residual ulcers in three. Thirty patients were treated medically and only one (with uncontrollable haemorrhage) required operation. Most patients were symptom free two to six years after the initial diagnosis. Our results suggest that young children may develop acute duodenal ulcers after viral illnesses whether or not they are treated with drugs, mainly antipyretics. This kind of acute duodenal ulcer usually heals quickly irrespective of the morphology, site, and number of ulcers.\r"

Gastro-oesophageal reflux was detected in 30 (85%) subjects. The mean (SEM) number of episodes of reflux in 24 hours was 12.1 (2.1), and 3.2 (0.6) lasted over five minutes. The mean reflux index was 4.5 (1.0)%, and the longest episode 17.1 (4.6) 17.1. Reflux was unrelated to postconceptional age or to resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. The mean reflux index was low at rest before feeds, being 1.8 (0.6)%, and increased slightly after feeds (3.8 (1.0)%), but was significantly increased after nursing care to 16.4 (3.0)%, and while xanthines were being given (5.9 (1.6)%. A subgroup of seven infants with xanthine resistant apnoea had severe gastro-oesophageal reflux that was not clinically apparent (reflux index 27.4 (3.6)%). Successful treatment of the reflux (reflux index: 3.6 (1.2)%) was associated with cessation of the apnoea. We conclude that gastro-oesophageal reflux is common, and is usually not clinically apparent, even when severe. It is important to consider gastro-oesophageal reflux in the differential diagnosis of xanthine resistant apnoea in preterm infants.\r"

The boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were significantly developmentally delayed when compared with the control group. The developmental delay was most pronounced in locomotor function and language. There was no significant difference in social class distribution. Early diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is of vital importance if secondary cases within families are to be prevented. While diagnosis is still unacceptably late in most cases, it can be improved if all boys with this pattern of developmental delay are screened for Duchenne muscular dystrophy by measurement of creatine kinase activity.\r"

The results indicate striking improvements in survival beyond three years for many childhood tumours over this period. For most childhood tumours considered over 80% of those who had survived at least three years were alive 10 years later. Comparison of mortality observed among survivors with that expected for the general population showed evidence of cure among those who had survived at least three years after non-Hodgkin lymphomas and non-genetic retinoblastoma. Survivors of other tumours, with sufficient cases surviving beyond 10 years to examine excess mortality, rarely experienced an excess that exceeded one extra death per 100 survivors per year. Children who had survived at least 10 years after other embryonal tumours, soft tissue sarcomas, or osteosarcoma never experienced an excess mortality exceeding one extra death per 200 survivors per year.\r"

Eleven abandoned clean intermittent catheterisation, five because of poor control, four by choice despite good control, and only two because of deterioration of upper urinary tract disease. Most of them usually had bacteriuria, but only 32 developed occasional symptomatic infections. Urinary calculi occurred in six, epididymitis in three, and urethral problems in four. Upper urinary tract dilatation did not arise in a previously normal renal system in any patient during clean intermittent catheterisation. Clean intermittent catheterisation was successful in controlling wetting with few serious complications, and was well tolerated. It remains the method of choice for the management of neuropathic urinary incontinence in such children.\r"

There were 1259 children examined and referrals for vision, hearing, and language assessment were made for 39(3.1%), 75(6.0%), and 27(2.1%), respectively. About 80% of these problems, however, were not known to the child health services when the children were 3.5 years old, mainly because children had moved to the district after the age of 3.5, and did not attend the 3.5 year screening clinics. Referrals formed only a small percentage of children who failed a test (11.0% failed vision, 19.5% hearing, and 24.6% language assessments). For vision and hearing the most important reason for the discrepancy was the clinical medical officers' wish to reassess children who failed the test before referring them. For the language test the clinical medical officer's often believed that the screening did not reflect the child's skills, which suggests that language screening as currently used in the district is not effective. Evaluation of the examination has highlighted the need to review the tests being used.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty three children aged 6 years old who had weighed less than 1251 g at birth without cerebral palsy and receiving mainstream education, were entered into a controlled study of motor skills. The index and control children were matched by age, sex, and school. The index group were considered by their teachers to have similar academic performances to their index group were considered by their teachers to have similar academic performances to their controls, although two index cases were receiving remedial teaching. On the test of motor impairment extremely low birthweight children had significantly more motor difficulties than controls. In addition, the index group had more minor neurological signs, lower intelligence quotients, and more adverse behavioural traits. The higher motor impairment scores among index children were independent of differences in intelligence quotient between the two groups. There was no association between impairment score and the presence or degree of periventricular haemorrhage or periventricular leucomalacia on neonatal cerebral ultrasound. Children with Apgar scores at five minutes of less than 7 had significantly higher impairment scores compared with those whose scores were 7 or more. Three perinatal factors (Apgar score at five minutes, neonatal septicaemia, and abnormal movements) explained 32% of the variance in impairment score at the age of 6 years. In children who do not have cerebral palsy perinatal factors may still be important in the development of motor skills. The presence of subtle neuromotor impairments at 6 years of age has implications for schooling that need further evaluation.\r"

A case-control study matched three controls for social class, maternal age, parity and marital state, and a further three controls for the infant's sex, gestation, and birth weight. Comparison of cases and controls showed no consistent differences in social and environmental factors, history of pregnancy, labour, or delivery. Important differences were found in the incidence of respiratory and neurological symptoms in the neonatal period. These prospective data derived form two whole populations of births support the hypothesis that most cases of cerebral palsy are not associated with adverse obstetric factors, and confirm that neonatal neurological symptoms are associated with subsequent cerebral palsy.\r"

The area under the curve of the Doppler frequency spectrum was used and was obtained from the anterior cerebral artery in the infants before and after infusions of plasma or dopamine. Both interventions significantly reduced the variability without a demonstrable effect on cardiac output, heart rate, or cerebral blood flow velocity. The reduction was from a median of 13% to 5% after plasma and from 13% to 4% after dopamine. The effect was probably due to an increase in circulating blood volume. It is proposed that appreciable variations in systolic blood pressure occurring in phase with respiration indicate a low central venous pressure in infants, as in adults and animals. The variations could be transmitted to the cerebral circulation in the absence of autoregulation, and their detection in either the aorta or a cerebral artery may prove a useful index of hypovolaemia.\r"

The strength and magnitude of this association between high plasma alkaline phosphase activity and body length was greater than that for any other factor identified, including the infant's sex and the presence of fetal growth retardation. Data are presented that support the view that the high plasma alkaline phosphatase activity reflected early bone mineral substrate deficiency resulting in metabolic bone disease. We speculate that even silent early bone disease may interfere with the control of subsequent linear growth and emphasise the potential importance of providing preterm infants, especially those fed human milk, with adequate substrate for bone mineralisation.\r"

When oral feeding became possible, nine received mother's own breast milk (group B), 15 formula feed (group F), and 12 formula feed supplemented with calcium (5 ml 10% calcium gluconate/100 ml feed) and phosphorus (0.5 ml 17% potassium phosphate similarly) (group S). All received a daily supplement of 400 IU vitamin D. Intakes of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, energy, and fluid volume were recorded. When oral feeding started, and near 40 weeks' postconception, bone mineral content of the forearm was measured by photon absorptiometry; weight and crown-heel length were also measured. After logarithmic transformation of the measurements, there were no significant intergroup differences between the mean rate constants for weight or crown-heel length describing growth during the observation period. The mean rate constant for mineral accretion (M) was significantly higher in group S than in both the others. Pooling all data, M was significantly correlated with calcium intake but not with any other variable. Mineral supplementation of feed can reduce but not cure osteopenia of prematurity.\r"

The system permitted bone mineral content to be measured with minimal disturbance to the infants in their incubators. Mean bone mineral content at birth was 2.4 mg/mm shaft length, decreasing to 1.9 mg/mm at 6 weeks of age, before starting to rise. Mineralisation was poor compared with that of a fetus at an equivalent postconceptual age. Mean intakes of calcium and phosphate were considerably less than the intrauterine accumulation of these minerals and it is postulated that this was the main cause of the poor mineralisation. Radiographic densitometry is both accurate and precise and has advantages over photon absorptiometry in that it can be used to measure bone mineral in infants who are not only preterm, but also ill enough to require intensive care.\r"

The animals were killed at 72 hours of age and tissue samples examined for radioactivity. Maximum activity was found in the luminal contents, and activity in the liver and spleen was higher than in bone marrow, the site where free isotope is normally deposited. These findings suggest that some intact milk leucocytes may cross from the gastrointestinal tract into the neonatal circulation. Also the high activity in gastrointestinal tissue that had been washed several times indicates that leucocytes adhere to mucosa or lie intramurally. We speculate that the presence of leucocytes in the gastrointestinal tract 60 hours after a single breast feed can provide an important defence mechanism against infection.\r"

Umbilical cord arterial and venous plasma samples were assayed for lignocaine, and auditory brain stem evoked responses were elicited at 35 and 70 dB at less than 4 (test 1) and greater than or equal to 48 hours (test 2). Mean wave I-V intervals were prolonged in test 1 when compared with test 2. Linear regression showed the arterial:venous ratio accounted for 66% (left ear) and 43% (right ear) of the variance in test 1 intervals. No association was found in test 2. In newborn infants, changes in serial auditory brain stem evoked response tests occur after maternal lignocaine epidural anaesthesia and these changes correlate with blood lignocaine concentrations.\r"

Observations were spread over the 24 hour period to obtain a complete pattern of events. Mean eyelid closure was 74%. When babies were grouped by gestational age, however, differences became apparent, babies of less than 26 weeks having their eyes shut for only 55% of observations compared with 93% at 28 weeks. Trend analysis confirmed that eyelid closure reached a peak at 28 weeks. Neonates exposed to a day/night regimen, opened their eyes significantly more than those exposed to continuous illumination. We suggest that frequency of eyelid opening may be related both to the infant's developmental state (postmenstrual age) and the illumination of the neonatal unit. Frequency of eyelid opening should therefore be considered when calculating the ocular light exposure of preterm neonates.\r"

Two colitis patients died after operation (0.3%), but no polyposis patients died. Overall operative complications appeared in 26% and 29% of polyposis and colitis patients, respectively (NS). Reoperation for intestinal obstruction did not differ between the two groups, but sepsis requiring reoperation was more common in colitis patients (6%) than in polyposis patients (0%, p less than 0.04). At follow-up (mean, 3 years), polyposis patients had fewer daytime stools (4.5 stools per day), less nighttime fecal spotting (26%), and less pouchitis (7%) than colitis patients (5.8 stools per day; spotting, 40%; pouchitis, 22%; p less than 0.002). The conclusion was that polyposis patients tolerated the operation better and had less long-term disability than did colitis patients. The data suggest that postoperative sepsis, daytime stooling frequency, nocturnal incontinence, and pouchitis may be, at least in part, disease related and not surgeon or operation related.\r"

In our symptomatic patients crude annual stroke incidence, including perioperative strokes (2.7%), was 2.1%. This is superior to the annual stroke incidence seen in patients on \"optimal\" medical therapy as defined by the Canadian Cooperative Study (4.6% in men), the AICLA Study (2.9%), the American Multicenter Trial (8%), and the Canadian- American Cooperative Trial (approximately 5%). In our asymptomatic patients, crude annual stroke incidence, including perioperative strokes (1.1%), was 1.4%. This is superior to nonsurgical therapy for asymptomatic patients with hemodynamically significant or more than 75% stenoses as reported by the Mayo Clinic (3.4%) or Chambers and Norris (2.7%).

Chronic administration of cholestyramine, a resin that binds bile salts, increases release of CCK and growth of the pancreas in guinea pigs. Feeding the bile salt, taurocholate, inhibits meal-stimulated release of CCK. The purpose of this study was to determine whether endogenous CCK affects growth of the human cholangiocarcinoma, SLU-132. We implanted SLU-132 subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. The bile salt pool was depleted by feeding 4% cholestyramine for 40 days, either alone or enriched with 0.5% taurocholate for 32 days. When the mice were killed, tumors and pancreas were removed. Cholestyramine significantly inhibited the growth of SLU-132 and stimulated growth of the normal pancreas. Feeding of taurocholate acted to stimulate tumor growth. These results demonstrate that endogenous levels of CCK regulate growth of this human cholangiocarcinoma. Our findings suggest that manipulation of levels of endogenous gut hormones may, in the future, play a role in management of patients with certain gastrointestinal cancers.\r"

A total of 79 combined procedures were performed in 75 patients. All patients had tandem occlusive disease, with the inflow lesion felt to preclude a distal revascularization procedure alone. Revascularization was performed for incapacitating claudication in 17 (22%) and limb salvage indications in 62 (78%) cases. A mean resting iliac artery pressure gradient of 29 +/- 11 mmHg pre-PTA was reduced to 0.9 +/- 0.4 post-PTA. Major complications of PTA occurred in five (6%) cases, but four were successfully corrected at the time of the distal surgical procedure without alteration of the operative plan. Infrainguinal operations included 55 femoropopliteal or tibial bypass grafts, 18 femorofemoral grafts, and 6 profundaplasties. Mean follow-up was 43 months. By life table analysis, the 5-year primary patency rate of the distal surgical procedures was 76%; a secondary patency of 88% at 5 years was achieved by various means of reintervention. Mean pretreatment ankle/brachial index of 0.31 +/- 0.14 increased to 0.80 +/- 0.16 after operation (p less than 0.0001). The 5-year limb salvage rate was 90%. There were no operative deaths. We conclude that in carefully selected patients, combined use of iliac PTA and distal surgical reconstruction is effective and durable, safely reducing the extent of surgical intervention while reliably increasing the comprehensiveness of revascularization.\r"

Mixed venous blood samples were obtained for eicosanoids PGE2, PGF2 alpha, thromboxane B2, PGI2 (6-KetoPGF1 alpha) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Platelet (PLAT), and neutrophil (WBC) counts were also done and plasma elastase was measured. At 7:00 AM each day patient neutrophils were obtained for a study of zymosan-activated superoxide production using a chemiluminescence assay. These data were correlated with physiologic measurements of the Respiratory Index (RI), per cent pulmonary shunt (QS/QT), and respiratory compliance measures. Seven patients developed a fulminant post-traumatic ARDS syndrome within 96 hours after injury. Twelve patients without ARDS developed sepsis (TS) four or more days after injury, and 11 had uncomplicated postinjury courses (TR). Compared to both TR and TS, ARDS had a significant (p less than 0.01) rise in neutrophil superoxide production beginning on day 2 through day 4 after injury. This was preceded by rises in PGE2 and LTB4, which were significantly correlated with subsequent falls in PLAT and WBC and rises in TXB2, PGF1, and superoxide production and followed by increases in RI, QS/QT, and a fall in compliance. The significant difference in the pattern and sequence of events in ARDS compared to TR and TS patients suggests that in ARDS the earliest event may be related to peripheral release of PGE2 and LTB4 due to platelet activation and lung sequestration with release of PGF2 alpha, and by aggregation and leukocyte adherence with release of elastase. However, fulminant ARDS mortality appears to be related to the subsequent amplification of the LTB4 leukocyte activation with superoxide production that does not achieve significance before the second day after injury and rises to a maximum by day 4 after injury. These data suggest that post-trauma ARDS follows a different evolutionary pattern than that reported in animal models and is also different from that seen in human TS or TR patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We have developed a technique for safe removal of extensive vena caval thrombi extending up to the right atrium without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass or hypothermic cardioplegia. Cardiopulmonary bypass, however, is advocated for some type III thrombi, but the addition of the pump and heparinization compounds the magnitude of the procedure. We use a right thoracoabdominal approach for tumors arising from either kidney with vascular isolation of the vena cava from its insertion into the right atrium to the iliac bifurcation. From 1972 to 1988, 56 patients ranging in age from 31 to 76 years were evaluated and 53 underwent radical nephrectomy with en bloc vena caval tumor thrombectomy. Of these patients, 21 had subhepatic caval thrombus extension (level 1); 24 had extension into the intrahepatic vena cava (level 2), and 8 had thrombi extending into the heart (level 3). Overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 56%, 34%, and 25%, respectively. Crucial to survival was complete surgical excision. Successful extirpation of all apparent tumor was possible in 75% of the patients in this series. With an expected 5-year survival rate of 57% for those without metastatic disease to other organs, we continue to advocate an aggressive optimistic approach for patients if there is no preoperative evidence of metastatic disease.\r"

Forty-two measurements of plasma volume (green dye), extracellular volume (bromine), and total body water (deuterium) were done in ten traumatized patients (mean Injury Severity Score, ISS, = 34) and 23 similar control studies were done in eight healthy volunteers who were in stable fluid balance. Interstitial volume, intracellular volume, and blood volume were calculated from measured fluid spaces and hematocrit; COP was directly measured. Studies in volunteers on consecutive days indicated good reproducibility, with coefficients of variation equal to 3.5% for COP, 6.3% for plasma volume, 4.5% for extracellular volume, and 4.9% for total body water. COP values extended over the entire range seen clinically, from 10 to 30 mmHg. Interstitial volume was increased by 55% in patients, but intracellular volume was decreased by 10%. We conclude (1) that posttraumatic peripheral edema resulting from hemodilution is located in the interstitial compartment, with no intracellular space expansion; and (2) that interstitial volume, but not intracellular volume, is closely related to plasma COP.\r"

  ".W": "The porcine bioprosthetic valve has been in use at Henry Ford Hospital since 1971. In this review, 980 patients with 1,081 porcine bioprosthetic valves were examined from 1 month to 16.4 years after implantation with a 99% complete follow-up. Patient survival was 59% +/- 2.2% (+/- standard error of the mean) at 10 years and 38% +/- 4.0% at 15 years. Factors associated with decreased survival after hospital discharge were age greater than 35 years and New York Heart Association functional class IV. Freedom from thromboembolism was 92% +/- 1.2% at 10 years and 89% +/- 3.2% at 15 years. Freedom from endocarditis was 93% +/- 1.2% at 10 years and 92% +/- 1.3% at 15 years. Freedom from structural valve degeneration for all valves was 71% +/- 2.6% at 10 years and 31% +/- 5.6% at 15 years. Factors associated with increased risk of structural valve degeneration were age younger than 35 years, female sex, and preoperative cardiac index greater than 2 L/min/m2. Among a total of 172 patients undergoing removal of a degenerated valve, mortality was 12.5%, and significant risk factors for death at reoperation were emergency operation and functional class IV. Experience with the porcine bioprosthetic valve after 15 years suggests that its use be confined to older patients or patients with a contraindication of anticoagulation.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical reperfusion of experimental infarction leads to improved recovery of regional function compared with medical reperfusion, but sustained myocardial salvage has not been demonstrated. Twenty-two dogs were subjected to two hours of anterior descending occlusion and divided into three groups: group P (n = 7), no reperfusion; group M (n = 8), medical reperfusion; and group S (n = 7), controlled surgical reperfusion. Ischemia caused systolic bulging (-36% of control systolic shortening, p less than 0.01) and decreased regional work (9% of control pressure-length loop area, p less than 0.05). Thirty minutes after reperfusion group M had persistent systolic bulging (-9% of control systolic shortening) and decreased regional work (9% of control pressure-length loop area), whereas group S had +17% of control systolic shortening and 33% of control pressure-length loop area. After 1 week, regional function improved in all three groups (percent of control systolic shortening: group P, 26%; group M, 19%; group S, 52%), but systolic shortening was significantly better in group S (p less than 0.05 versus group M). Surgical reperfusion also resulted in one half of the eventual myocardial necrosis found in the other groups (group P, 45% of area at risk; group M, 38%; group S, 19%; p less than 0.05, group S versus group P or M). In this model, medical reperfusion offered no demonstrable benefit, whereas controlled surgical reperfusion led to a sustained (1 week) improvement in regional function and significant myocardial salvage.\r"

Fifty-seven patients (age range, 2 to 70 years; mean age, 30 years) underwent 59 operations for replacement of the aortic valve (20) or entire left ventricular outflow tract (39) using autograft (35) or allograft (24) valves. Many had undergone a previous operation (25) or had concomitant procedures (13). Postoperative mortality was 8.5% (5/59). Two deaths occurred in the allograft group and three in the more complex pulmonary autograft group. One late death occurred. One autograft was replaced with an allograft 7 months postoperatively for severe aortic regurgitation. There have been no episodes of either endocarditis or thromboembolism. Forty-nine of 51 survivors are in New York Heart Association class I. Preliminary results suggest that congenital or acquired disease of the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic valve can be safely and effectively treated with either allograft or autograft valve transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The occurrence of unanticipated and seemingly unexplicable major complications of hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac dysfunction after palliative operation for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy prompted a review of 71 sequential patients. Fifty-five patients had been treated preoperatively with beta-blockers, calcium-channel inhibitors, or both, and 16 had received amiodarone for six to 566 days (mean time, 210 days) at total doses ranging from 8 to 175 g (mean dose, 82 g) and had drug-free intervals prior to operation of zero to 457 days (mean time, 91 days). Comparisons were made between the two treatment groups and between those with and without major complications within the amiodarone-treated group. Preoperative cardiac studies, sex, age, functional class, and type of operation were not related to outcome for the entire patient cohort. In amiodarone-treated patients, the major findings were as follows: a 50% incidence of hepatic dysfunction with a tenfold increase in concentrations of serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase; a 25% incidence of pulmonary dysfunction necessitating a fourfold increase in the number of days of ventilator support; and a 19% incidence of low cardiac output syndrome with two deaths. Only 44% of the amiodarone-treated group had no serious complications. The incidence of major complications of the liver, lungs, and heart was 2%, 0%, and 2%, respectively, in patients not treated with amiodarone. Abnormal preoperative pulmonary function studies were predictive of prolonged postoperative ventilatory support. Discontinuation of amiodarone for several months prior to operation appeared to reduce the incidence of major complications. The necessary drug-free interval required preoperatively could not be determined from this retrospective experience.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Six consecutive patients with active aortic valve endocarditis, including 2 with extensive subannular aortic root abscess, were successfully treated with viable cryopreserved homograft aortic valve replacement. Two patients required extensive aortic root reconstruction with an appropriately trimmed aortic homograft to cover large abscess cavities. All patients showed resolution of infection with no perioperative mortality or clinically significant morbidity. Three patients had a minor degree of aortic insufficiency on postoperative echo-Doppler study. On follow-up at 6 to 48 months, all patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I. The resistance of the unstented homograft to infection makes it an attractive choice for patients requiring aortic valve replacement for active endocarditis. The results of surgical intervention in patients with extensive aortic root involvement may be further improved by the flexibility afforded by the homograft to be \"custom-fit\" to the abnormal aortic root and the ability to achieve secure abnormal aortic root and the ability to achieve secure valve fixation without use of prosthetic material.\r"

Preimplantation arrhythmia was ventricular tachycardia in 7 patients and ventricular fibrillation in 5 patients. The mean ejection fraction was 19%. Six patients were at high risk for general anesthesia for a variety of medical problems, and 2 patients had had a previous cardiac operation. Epidural anesthesia was used in 8 patients without intubation. The surgical approach used a longitudinal epigastric extraperitoneal incision with access to the heart through an incision made in the central tendon of the diaphragm. Two patches and two epicardial sensing leads were placed in all patients. All patients but one could be defibrillated with 20 J or less. There was no operative mortality and minimal morbidity. There were two late deaths due to heart failure. Thus, the transdiaphragmatic approach provides an excellent exposure for automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation, avoids general anesthesia and thoracotomy, and can be used after a previous cardiac operation.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft for superior vena cava (SVC) substitution presents the problems of flexion and kinking when the graft is long. We therefore replaced the SVC of dogs with two types of prosthetic substitutes, ePTFE (Gore-Tex) and spiral-supported ePTFE (Im/praflex), and evaluated the long-term patency of the prosthetic substitutes. Total replacement of the SVC was performed in 9 adult mongrel dogs. The substitutes were ePTFE and spiral-supported ePTFE in 5 and 4 dogs, respectively. The animals were killed about 3 years after replacement of the SVC, and the harvested specimens were histologically examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Evaluation of ePTFE revealed late occlusion in 1 of 5 dogs. The spiral-supported ePTFE showed patency in all dogs. In the group with ePTFE grafts, light microscopic examination revealed abnormalities of endothelial cells, granulation, and necrosis. There was no hyperplasia of the subendothelial connective tissue near the center. In the animals with spiral-supported ePTFE grafts, the subendothelial connective tissue showed favorable growth even in the center of the reconstructed site. There was no granulation in the spiral-supported ePTFE group. Scanning electron microscopic examination in the ePTFE group showed that endothelial cells were spindle-shaped and had an irregular surface. The spiral-supported ePTFE group showed an almost regular form of endothelial cells and no abnormalities except for the slightly spindled shape in the center. Therefore, we recommend that spiral-supported ePTFE should be used as an SVC substitute in clinical situations.\r"

The patients ranged in age from 7 months to 75 years. All were symptomatic preoperatively. The diagnosis of pericardial effusion was confirmed by echocardiogram in all but 2 patients. Eight patients had acute pericardial tamponade. Subxiphoid pericardial drainage was performed under general (n = 35) or local anesthesia (n = 6). A portion of the anterior pericardium was excised in each patient. There were no perioperative deaths. Thirty-day mortality was 19.5%; there were five late deaths. All deaths were unrelated to pericardial effusion or to the operation. One patient had recurrent effusion requiring pericardiocentesis on the 21st postoperative day. He died five days later of extensive lymphoma. Twenty-eight patients were followed from 1 month to 10 years; mean follow-up was 31.5 months. None developed recurrent effusion or pericardial constriction. We conclude that subxiphoid pericardial drainage is effective for treatment of pericardial effusion.\r"

  ".W": "Efficacy of surgical closure versus indomethacin for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in symptomatic neonates is an ongoing controversy. In recent years, surgical closure has been performed in the neonatal intensive care unit rather than the operating room in some centers, creating further controversy. In a retrospective study of the charts of 115 sequential patent ductus arteriosus surgical closures performed in the neonatal intensive care unit in premature infants, we found no surgical morbidity or mortality. Ninety-nine of these infants of less than 33 weeks gestational age were evaluated for various factors that might influence outcome. All were operated on within 72 hours of diagnosis, with an extra-pleural approach and metal clips used for closure of the ductus. All infants were extubated at an average of 33 weeks in each age group studied unless they had underlying severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We conclude that surgical closure of the symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in neonates is safe and 100% effective, with none of the reported complications of indomethacin therapy, and should be the treatment of choice in neonates aged less than 33 weeks (gestational age) at birth with symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus. Closure performed in the neonatal intensive care unit eliminates transport risks and is ultimately safer and easier than transport to an operating room.\r"

The study period was July 1974 through June 1987. The total number of affected devices was collected for each manufacturer. Available sales data were used to calculate their percentage of recalled products during two time periods. The percentage of potentially high-risk devices (Food and Drug Administration class I and II recalls) was high for one company, moderate for one, and relatively low for the rest. Potential biases in some other sources of reliability information, as well as implications for regulatory policies, are discussed. The data reported establish that there have been past deficiencies in recall management. Although further pacing device recalls are probable, appropriate early regulatory and manufacturer action should help to assure that both the immense cost and patient distress caused by pacer and related product problems in the past can be minimized in the future.\r"

Four groups of 6 dogs each were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Control group A (work only) performed two hours of controlled work by contracting against a saline-filled left intraventricular balloon. Control group B (ischemia only) underwent 45 minutes of global normothermic ischemia before simple blood reperfusion while supported on bypass. Groups C and D were subjected to ischemia and reperfusion as in group B, followed by controlled work stress as in group A. Group D, however, received 500 mL of St. Thomas' Hospital solution immediately before blood reperfusion. Morphological analysis showed no significant injury in groups A and B, whereas group C had 11.4% +/- 2.4% necrosis of heart mass versus 2.5% +/- 1.1% in group D (p less than 0.001). Biochemical data from left ventricular biopsies showed no significant differences between groups B, C, and D. Functional analyses showed deterioration of diastolic compliance in group C (p less than 0.05), although a significant difference in systolic functional indexes could not be detected. Myocardial protection and salvage was improved by initial reperfusion with an asanguineous cardioplegic solution versus reperfusion with blood alone.\r"

Twenty-one patients (84%) are long-term survivors with 2,035 months follow-up (range, 41 to 143 months; mean, 96.9 months). Twenty-three Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthetic valves, one Ionescu-Shiley bioprosthetic valve, and nine St. Jude Medical valves were inserted. Follow-up of 17 patients with a Carpentier-Edwards valve ranged from 5 years 9 months to 11 years 9 months (mean, 8 years 11 months). To date there has been one reoperation after 3 years 4 months in this group. One patient who received an Ionescu-Shiley bioprosthesis required re-replacement at 20 months after operation. Three of 4 patients who received St. Jude mechanical valves and are long-term survivors have required replacement after 36 to 56 months. We conclude that the Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthetic valve is a viable option in the right side of the heart in the young age group when annular size is adequate to accommodate an appropriate bioprosthesis.\r"

When inferior vena cava venography revealed that the obstruction was accompanied by long segmental thrombosis, additional dilation was performed with a Hegar dilator. There was no surgical mortality. Early operative complications included pulmonary embolism in 2 patients and bleeding requiring reoperation in 1. In a mean follow-up period of 30.6 months (range, 2 to 88 months), 9 patients had no symptoms, transient pericardial constriction developed in 1 patient and resolved 1 month later, and restenosis of the inferior vena cava developed in another patient 1 year after the first operation. This latter patient received a second transatrial membranotomy followed by percutaneous balloon angioplasty of the inferior vena cava, with a satisfactory result at 8 months follow-up.

Additional congenital defects were present in 17 patients (30%). All patients underwent patch closure of the ostium primum defect and 47 of 56 patients (84%) underwent mitral valvuloplasty. Hospital mortality was 1.8% (one death). Arrhythmias developed in 7 other patients in the early postoperative period, of which six were transient and resolved completely. One patient required early pacemaker placement for complete heart block. Cumulative follow-up was 378 patient-years. There were three late deaths (5.7%), and additional operations were required in 12 patients (22.6%). Seven of these 12 patients required mitral valve replacement for severe mitral regurgitation. The mean interval between initial repair and mitral valve replacement was 4.2 years, with only three valves needing replacement within 12 months. There was a significant correlation between the severity of mitral regurgitation before initial repair and subsequent need for mitral valve replacement. Late onset atrial arrhythmias have developed in 6 patients. Current functional status has been evaluated in 50 of 52 surviving patients and 88.5% are in NYHA class I, with the remainder in class II.\r"

Pulmonary artery banding was performed in a heterogeneous group of patients aged two days to 60 months (median, 10 weeks; mean, 21.8 weeks) and weighing 1.4 to 13.8 kg (mean, 4.2 kg). Diagnosis was ventricular septal defect in 76 (41.5%) and atrioventricular communis in 41 (22.4%). Pulmonary artery banding was also used in patients with d-transposition of the great vessels with ventricular septal defect, double-outlet right ventricle, univentricular heart, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus. Early death occurred in 39 of 175 patients who underwent pulmonary artery banding at Ochsner Foundation Hospital (22.3%). Definitive operation has been performed in 37 of the patients who underwent pulmonary artery banding since 1979 with excellent outcome in 32 (86.5%). Pulmonary artery banding is a useful palliative procedure for a diverse group of patients with congenital cardiac anomalies and unrestricted pulmonary blood flow. With improved results of primary repair of intracardiac anomalies in small infants, however, pulmonary artery banding should be reserved for severely ill patients with complex lesions not amenable to early definitive correction. Currently, pulmonary artery banding is indicated in patients with excessive pulmonary blood flow and single ventricle or tricuspid atresia. Pulmonary artery banding is also appropriate in certain patients with atrioventricular communis and in patients with muscular or multiple ventricular septal defects. Pulmonary artery banding is an option in patients with ventricular septal defect and coarctation of the aorta.\r"

Conditions will never be as they were 25 years ago, but they could be closer to what was expected in 1976. As the FDA constantly seeks to improve its performance and Congress focuses on possible changes to the Act, the cardiovascular community of practitioners, inventors, and manufacturers should offer their assistance. I believe the creative spirit that enables you as pioneers to reflect on your accomplishments and contemplate even greater innovations for the future should again be applied to the process of helping the FDA improve the way it serves us--the public.\r"

Valve-related morbidity was in the lower expected ranges for prosthetic aortic valves: ball variance, 0.3%/patient-year; paraprosthetic leak, 0.41%/patient-year; valve endocarditis, 0.43%/patient-year; valve thrombosis, 0.04%/patient-year; and embolic events, 3.95%/patient-year. The incidence of aortic valve reoperation was 0.76%/patient-year. The 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year probability of survival corrected for normal mortality was 77%, 64%, and 52% for all discharged patients. This review confirms the Magovern-Cromie valve to be a safe, durable, and efficient prosthetic valve.\r"

Sixteen patients died within 30 days after operation, and 34 died in the late postoperative period, with a cumulative mortality rate of 40.3%. Postoperative complications included valve thrombosis in 9 patients, thromboembolism in 4, and mechanical valve failure in 5. The Wada-Cutter valve, first described at the Annual Meeting of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons on January 27, 1967, in a discussion on the paper by Cooley and colleagues on mitral valve replacement with a discoid valve, attracted attention for its unique design. Four of the Wada-Cutter valves were incorporated in Liotia's total artificial heart, which was implanted clinically for the first time in Cooley's second-stage heart transplantation. It may not only claim to be the origin of today's most popular tilting-disc heart valves but also has some original concepts with regard to bileaflet and tricuspid tilting-disc heart valves. However, at that time, cardiac valve replacement with this prosthesis resulted in a high incidence of thrombosis without systemic anticoagulation and in mechanical valve failure due to hinge wear of the Teflon occluder. For these reasons, its clinical use was discontinued in 1974. If Pyrolite carbon had been adopted in construction of the valve when it first became available, the valve design could have been useful even today.\r"

We have 15 years of experience, with 903 plastic surgical procedures with cardiopulmonary bypass for acquired mitral (636), aortic (51), and tricuspid (216) valve diseases. The 15-year survival rate for patients with mitral stenosis was 68% +/- 5%, and the 8-year survival rate for patients with mitral insufficiency was 81% +/- 3%. The 10-year survival rate for patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease was 59% +/- 3% because of the initially grave condition of such patients. For the correction of acquired aortic valve disease we advocate a new type of operation: a method of stent plasty of the aortic root with two circular sutures placed on the level of the arch and fibrotic ring. In combination with gradual commissurotomy, parietal resection of leaflets and parocommissural plication are performed. This procedure is an effective method for the plastic reconstruction of the aortic valve, and it provides a good hemodynamic effect.\r"

Of these 35% were younger than 35 years, 93.7% belonged to New York Heart Association functional class IV, and 24% had had a previous heart operation. The 10-year survival rate without hospital mortality was 68.94% +/- 4.86%. Total follow-up was 11,232 patient-months (range; 6 to 118 months; mean, 57 months; 97% complete). Main causes of death and reoperation were (per patient-year) infectious endocarditis, 3.2%; spontaneous bioprosthesis degeneration, 0.96%; mechanical dysfunction resulting from damage in the manufacturing of the prosthesis, 0.74%; left atrial thrombosis and/or thromboemboli, 0.5%; sudden death, 0.2%; cardiac insufficiency, 0.3%; and other, 0.4%.\r"

We implanted the first clinical Hancock modified-orifice valve in 1976, and have used this valve for aortic valve replacement to the present time. This analysis compares and contrasts the clinical performance of 401 Hancock standard and 385 Hancock modified-orifice valves over a period of 10 years. Statistical significance in actuarial curves at 120 months was noted in long-term survival and thromboemboli. There was a slightly smaller amount of structural valve degeneration and incidence of reoperation with the modified-orifice valve compared with the standard valve. The Hancock modified-orifice valve has proven to be a satisfactory aortic valve replacement device, and its complex fabrication has withstood the test of time.\r"

These patients were compared with a control group from a population survey in Switzerland (877 men and 850 women). Mean systolic pressure (+/- SD) in the diabetic population was 139.3 +/- 21 mm Hg as compared with 125.5 +/- 17 mm Hg among controls. Mean diastolic pressure was 85.4 +/- 12 mm Hg in diabetic subjects as compared with 79.1 +/- 12 mm Hg in controls. The difference was reduced by about 25% after adjustment for body mass, age, and sex; 30.7% of diabetic subjects as compared with 8.2% among controls were hypertensive. Sixty-two percent of the hypertensive diabetic patients and 45% of the hypertensive controls were receiving antihypertensive treatment. In a multivariate analysis, presence of proteinuria and larger body mass had an important influence on systolic and diastolic blood pressures and the risk of hypertension. Diabetes duration had a significant influence only on systolic blood pressure. Efforts are needed in the clinical and research field to limit and clarify the harmful effects of elevated blood pressure in diabetes.\r"

There was no statistically significant association between age or sex and the mean thyrotropin value or the presence of thyroid autoantibodies. The relationship between the mean thyroxine level and sex was mildly significant. Of the patients with hypothyroidism, 78.5% were female, and most were between the ages of 30 and 50 years. However, a higher-than-expected number of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism were under age 30 years. These findings highlight the lack of adequate health care services available to persons with Down syndrome who live in the community. All persons with Down syndrome must undergo regular clinical and laboratory screening for the presence of thyroid disease.\r"

The ages of the patients ranged from 21 to 86 years (median, 45 years); 61 (21%) were men and 228 (79%) were women. Surgical confirmation of the cytologic diagnosis was obtained in 59 patients. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy identified 10% of the nodules as probably malignant and 10% as possibly malignant. Of these nodules, 30.5% were proved to be malignant by histologic examination. The accuracy of distinction between a benign (class I or II) or probably malignant (class IV) diagnosis was 95.2%. Patient acceptance of this procedure was good and complications were infrequent. These results indicate that fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid is accurate, safe, well tolerated, and easily applied, without its highly desirable features being compromised, even when a moderate number of such procedures are performed.\r"

In 43 (31%) of these patients, the examination was incomplete or the results were uninterpretable. Thirteen patients could not retain the barium, and 27 patients had too much stool. Characteristics associated with an inadequate barium enema included confusion (adjusted odds ratio, 3.5), fever (adjusted odds ratio, 4.1), and cachexia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.7). Characteristics more common among subjects unable to retain barium than among subjects with too much stool were diarrhea (38% vs 18%) and fecal incontinence (31% vs 0%). The high frequency of inadequate results suggests that clinicians should consider whether a barium enema is the appropriate test in elderly patients with these characteristics, and, if so, what interventions may increase the chance for success.\r"

For all subtypes of stroke combined, the increased relative risk was related to the daily intake of cigarettes, the heaviest smokers having a higher relative risk than that for light smokers. The estimated increase in relative risk among smokers was 1.5 for each 10 cigarettes smoked daily in both men and women. We conclude that cigarette smoke may be an important preventable factor for both hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic stroke.\r"

A case-control study showed that case-patients were more likely than neighborhood control subjects to have eaten cooked crabs or cooked or raw shrimp during the week before illness. Case-patients who ate crabs were more likely than control subjects who ate crabs to have undercooked and mishandled the crabs after cooking. A third vehicle from the Gulf waters, raw oysters, caused V cholerae 01 infection in two persons residing in Florida and Georgia. All three seafood vehicles came from multiple sources. Stool isolates from the Louisiana case-patients were genetically identical to other North American strains isolated since 1973, but differ from African and Asian isolates. While crabs are the most important vehicle for V cholerae 01 infection in the United States, shrimp and oysters from the Gulf coast can also be vehicles of transmission. A persisting reservoir of V cholerae 01 along the Gulf coast may continue to cause sporadic cases and outbreaks of cholera in Gulf states and in states importing Gulf seafood.\r"

  ".W": "Screening mammography is underutilized in many primary care practices. We designed a prospective, controlled trial to evaluate two strategies for improving the utilization of mammography in an academic general medicine clinic. We assigned teams of house officers to (1) physician audit with periodic feedback, (2) a visit-based strategy directed at both patient and physician, or (3) a no intervention concurrent control arm. After 6 months, the percentage of 50- to 74-year-old women meeting the standard of an annual mammogram was 36% for patients in the control arm, 62% for patients of feedback residents, and 54% for patients of the arm receiving the visit-based strategy. Patients of female providers were slightly more likely to meet the standard, but no effects were detected for patient race, new as opposed to follow-up patient, or higher frequency of clinic visits. We conclude that audit with feedback and a new visit-based strategy of a patient cue associated with a simplification of the ordering process each greatly improved the rate of utilization of screening mammography. Practitioners could reasonably choose the strategy most suited to their own situation.\r"

Although a subjective benefit was claimed by most patients, the polygraphic data showed no improvement or only a modest improvement in breathing pattern, oxyhemoglobin saturation, or general sleep architecture except in one patient. In this patient the evolution of the syndrome was recent (3 years) and surgical management of a parapharyngeal tumor resulted in a cure. We conclude that in adults with sleep apnea syndrome of long-standing, surgical correction of nasal or pharyngeal abnormalities should not be expected to normalize sleep and breathing. This contrasts with the known benefits achieved by the same type of surgery in children. Surgery might nevertheless be necessary in some adults to permit the application of other therapeutic means (ie, nasal continuous positive airway pressure).\r"

He underwent endoscopic retrograde and papillotomy before a positive history for methyltestosterone ingestion could be obtained. Since methyltestosterone is most often used for sexual impotence, the patient may be quite reluctant to mention this hormone as part of his medication. A normal or mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase level, disproportionate to the level of hyperbilirubinemia seen in this patient and in all previous reports, appears to be characteristic of this phenomenon. This pattern of liver function abnormality can be a clue to suspect methyltestosterone as the causative agent and spare the patient unneeded expensive noninvasive and potentially harmful invasive procedures.\r"

We also estimated the risk of a first anxiety disorder and examined its predictors. Of 104 cases, 41% had anxiety disorders in conjunction with their index depression, which was more likely with MDD and DD than with ADDM. The age-corrected risk of a first anxiety disorder was 0.47 up to age 18 years. Separation-anxiety disorder was the most frequent diagnosis of anxiety, followed by overanxious disorder of childhood. Among the MDD cases with comorbidity, the anxiety disorder preceded the depression about two thirds of the time and often persisted after the depression remitted. The effect of comorbid anxiety disorder on the length of index MDD depended on the presence of other clinical features, but it did not seem to affect the risk of subsequent MDD or the course of DD or ADDM. Concurrent maternal psychopathology and poor physical health increased the risk of anxiety disorder in the children, but a history of prior separation from parental figures did not seem to have an effect.\r"

Eleven of the 18 depressed patients were restudied during clinical remission following either electroconvulsive therapy or treatment with amitriptyline hydrochloride. During the acute phase of the illness, the unipolar depressed patients had fragmented patterns of PRL secretion with an early timing of the nocturnal secretory phase of PRL, which started, on the average, 2 hours earlier than in healthy subjects. Moreover, the amplitude of the circadian variation of PRL was reduced in these patients, with subnormal PRL levels occurring during the midsleep period. This latter abnormality was also observed in bipolar patients, who had otherwise normal PRL profiles. These lower midsleep PRL concentrations were associated with a significant increase in the amount of time spent awake during the same period. Antidepressant treatment did not consistently correct the abnormalities in the patterns of PRL release observed during the acute phase of the illness. These results indicate that early timing of nocturnal PRL secretion and damping of the nighttime PRL elevation may be found in men with endogenous depressive disorders. In contrast to disturbances of the corticotropic and somatotropic axes, these abnormalities of PRL secretion may still be present during clinical remission following antidepressant treatment.\r"

We have studied 20 subjects in each of these two categories and have found that bright artificial light did not alter mood and behavior in controls. In contrast, individuals with subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder responded favorably to treatment with bright environmental light. A dose of 5 hours of bright light exposure, divided between morning and evening, was more effective than 2 hours of exposure. This finding may have practical implications for establishing optimal environmental lighting conditions for those individuals whose winter difficulties do not meet criteria for seasonal affective disorder.\r"

The use of a \"first timer\" sample, and of a clinical diagnostic interview, had not, to our knowledge, been previously attempted in studies of psychiatric problems in the homeless. The majority of men had a history of mental disorder or of heavy substance use. On diagnostic interview, 17% of the men had a definite or probable history of psychosis, and another 8% had a possible history of psychosis. A confident diagnosis of schizophrenia was made in 8%. A history of alcohol or other drug abuse was evident in 58%. Cocaine was already (in 1985) the drug of choice; 27% of the study sample had used it more than 50 times. One third of the men were in extreme distress, much of it apparently acute and associated with the transition to the shelter, and 7% reported suicidal thoughts at the time of the interview. The newly homeless, compared with those who had been homeless for much of the 5 years prior to shelter entry, were younger and had fewer psychiatric problems.\r"

For DNA analysis and measurement of proliferative activity, the polyp parts were dissected and the nonpolypoid tissue was discarded. The study was limited to those specimens that were received in our department in the years 1972 and 1977. Of the 104 polyps that were submitted for flow cytometric analysis, 36 could not be analyzed owing to excessive debris or insufficient nuclei. DNA aneuploidy was identified in 32% of the cases, with a higher value noted in larger polyps and in severely dysplastic polyps, but these values were not statistically significant. Multiple adenomas from the same patient often showed different DNA histograms. When analyzed according to the percentage of cells in S phase, no significant difference was found in proliferative activity of polyps according to DNA content or size of the polyps. These results suggest that the diagnostic significance of aneuploidy and proliferative activity in polyps must be interpreted with caution.\r"

At Sinai Hospital of Detroit (SHD) (Mich), a criterion was established for adequacy of an FNB specimen (ie, at least six clusters of benign cells on each of two slides prepared from separate aspirations) in an attempt to reduce the rate of false-negative diagnoses attributable to inadequate sampling. To evaluate the SHD criterion, 20 \"problem\" cases were selected from the SHD files and were reviewed by pathologists from three other institutions in a blind study. A total of 80 diagnoses were rendered (four institutions each reviewing 20 cases). Seven false-negative diagnoses were rendered, three of which were made in cases that did not meet the SHD criterion for adequacy. An additional three false-negative diagnoses on inadequate FNB specimens were made by a physician who asked not to be identified. Implementation of the SHD criterion may reduce the frequency of false-negative diagnoses. A separate study was undertaken to determine the number of FNB aspirations necessary to obtain satisfactory specimens. One hundred adequate FNB specimens from SHD files were reviewed. In 77% of cases the first two to four aspirations were adequate, but 23% of the time six to eight aspirations were necessary to obtain adequate material.\r"

In each age group and in each patient, the diameter and height of adenomas showed a log normal distribution. Both variables differed significantly among patients in each age group and also between the two age groups. In the young adults, there was a selective growth of certain adenomas. Scatter diagrams of the diameter vs height of adenomas showed that adenomas grew preferentially in the horizontal plane in early development, giving adenomas a discoid shape. Adenomas greater than 8 mm in diameter grew both horizontally and vertically. The horizontal growth was due to division of adenomatous crypts, and adenomas greater than 8 mm in diameter also exhibited elongation of crypts.\r"

  ".W": "Thecal metaplasia of the adrenal was observed as an incidental autopsy finding in a 77-year-old man with acquired bilateral testicular atrophy, probably secondary to previous bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy. The metaplastic focus was composed of interlacing bundles of spindle cells attached to the adrenal capsule, strongly resembling ovarian theca. A related finding was hyperplasia of the anterior pituitary, involving particularly the basophils. We believe that the acquired gonadal failure of this man may have led to increased activity of the pituitary gonadotropes. Blastema cells outside of the testes with the ability to form gonadal stroma, such as cells of the adrenal capsule, were thereby stimulated to undergo metaplasia, giving rise to ovarian theca. Similar thecal metaplasia has been described previously in the adrenals of postmenopausal women. Whether the metaplastic foci are capable of hormone production is not known. Since this patient had an occult prostatic carcinoma at autopsy, potential hormone production by such metaplastic gonadal stroma is clinically relevant.\r"

VP-Expert processes data (complete blood cell count results, age, and sex) according to a set of user-written logic rules (our program) to reach conclusions as to the following causes of microcytic anemia: alpha- and beta-thalassemia trait, iron deficiency, and anemia of chronic disease. Our expert system was tested using previously interpreted complete blood cell count data. In most instances, there was good agreement between the expert system and its pathologist-author, but many discrepancies were found in the interpretation of anemia of chronic disease. We conclude that VP-Expert has a useful level of power and flexibility, yet is simple enough that individuals with modest programming experience can create their own expert systems. Limitations of such expert systems are discussed.\r"

Details of the program, ie, testing material, computer analysis, reference results, and scope of committee action, are discussed. In 1975, clinical expectations for WBC count determinations greatly exceeded most laboratories' capabilities. By 1987, participants were able to produce reliable, clinically useful WBC count results. The paramount reason for this improvement is the transition from manual to automated counting methods resulting from the stimulus of proficiency testing and the concomitant education.\r"

Pernicious anemia with hemoglobin concentration below 100 g/L was chosen as the model for this assessment. Sixty-two (51%) of 122 patients received blood transfusion, although most patients had chronic, low-grade symptoms despite their low hemoglobin levels and could have been satisfactorily managed without transfusion. Only 34 of the 122 had findings suggesting an urgent need to raise the blood cell count, but their transfusion rate (44%) was no different from that in patients without such findings. These observations in pernicious anemia indicate that transfusion of patients with medically reversible anemia is a common problem. They further suggest that current transfusion usage overemphasizes laboratory results (ie, hemoglobin levels) at the expense of clinical assessment of severity of symptoms. Improvement of current practice is needed, particularly in view of valid concerns about the serious side effects of transfusion, shortages of available blood resources, and health care costs.\r"

Normal values for sensory conduction and amplitude changes for this nerve segment have been rarely reported, and clinical usefulness of the sensory techniques remains unclear and controversial. This study reports an ulnar nerve sensory technique for the across-elbow segment. Normal data with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and for a 10-cm nerve segment were 1.8msec, mean +2SD for sensory latency measured to onset and 1.9msec to peak. Comparable motor latency was 2.0msec. Sensory amplitude decrement across the elbow was 41% mean +2SD and 7.6% for the comparable motor amplitude decrement. Three cases of ulnar nerve compression at the elbow are reported, exemplifying that this technique appears to be useful particularly in patients with sensory, as opposed to mixed (sensory and motor), clinical abnormalities.\r"

Twelve subjects (six men and six women) completed submaximal cycle ergometer tests (60% age-predicted maximum heart rate) in the supine and upright seated positions. Each test included 20 minutes of rest, 20 minutes of cycling, and 15 minutes of recovery. Stroke volume and heart rate were determined by impedance cardiography, and blood pressure was measured by auscultation during rest, immediately after exercise, and at minutes 1-5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 of recovery. Peripheral resistance was calculated from values of mean arterial pressure and cardiac output. No significant (p less than 0.05) postural differences in PR were noted during rest for either limb. Immediately after exercise, PR decreased (55% to 61%) from resting levels in both limbs, independent of posture. Recovery ankle PR values were significantly different between postures. Upright ankle PR returned to 92% of the resting level within four minutes of recovery, compared to 76% of the resting level after 15 minutes in the supine posture. Peripheral resistance values in the supine and upright arm were not affected by posture and demonstrated a gradual pattern of recovery similar to the supine ankle recovery response (85% to 88% of rest within 15 minutes). The accelerated recovery rate of PR after upright exercise may result from local vasoconstriction mediated by a central regulatory response to stimulation from gravitational pressure on lower body circulation.\r"

Static stability was studied on a tilting platform; dynamic stability was tested by having subjects descend a ramp. Elevating one or both footrests and adding one or two simulated casts each significantly reduced static forward stability. During dynamic testing with lowered footrests, only seven subjects tipped forward, and the extent of tip was limited by the footrests. With both footrests elevated, eight subjects tipped transiently, and 12 continued to tip until the footrests hit the floor. With the addition of simulated casts, all 20 subjects tipped fully. Elevating one footrest (with or without a cast) caused only transient tips. On a high-friction floor surface, 19 and 18 subjects (with and without casts) experienced full tips or yawing falls to the side of the elevated footrest. The addition of forward stabilizers prevented wheelchairs from full tips or falls, when the users had both legs elevated, or when one of the users' legs (p less than 0.005), was elevated while located on a high friction floor (p less than 0.005). These findings have implications for wheelchair design and prescription.\r"

Arm and bicycle tests used time-matched, discontinuous protocols (three-minute work stages alternated with three-minute rest intervals). Anaerobic threshold was determined by plotting expired minute volume (Ve) on oxygen consumption (VO2) and expressed as the percentage of the respective peak VO2 at which the deflection occurred. Analysis of variance revealed AT was similar for arm and bicycle tests. Absolute VO2 at AT was higher for bicycle than for arm ergometer exercise (p less than .05). Heart rate (HR) and rate pressure product (RPP) were higher for bicycle than for arm ergometry at AT (p less than .05). Moreover, a similarity in percent maximum RPP and percent maximum VO2 was observed at AT for arm ergometry, whereas percent maximum RPP was higher than percent maximum VO2 at AT for bicycle ergometry. Because AT has been suggested as an appropriate intensity of exercise for conditioning, it was concluded that a sufficient level of exercise intensity can be elicited at a lower percentage of the cardiovascular reserve for arm than for bicycle ergometer exercise.\r"

In the frontal projection, radiographs were taken during maximal bending to the left and right. The radiographs were analyzed on a digitizing tablet linked to a computer, using preset points to indicate the motion between the vertebrae. The intraobserver error of measurement was +/- 1.8 degrees. The range of axial rotation was measured with the aid of a compass placed on the subject's head. The intraobserver error of measurement with this technique was +/- 6 degrees. The largest intersegmental flexion-extension motion occurred between C4/C5 and C5/C6. A linear decrease of motion in all directions, except in flexion, was found with age. There was no statistically significant difference in motion for men and women.

A 71-year-old osteoarthritic woman was treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) and exercises for right-sided sciatic pain after a minor fall, but developed left groin pain and tenderness over the pubic symphysis after two days of exercise. She had an impacted fracture of the left pubic symphysis which responded to use of a cane. The second patient was a 90-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (on steroids) who complained of right hip pain after a series of falls in her home. Initially treated with Buck traction for a presumed hip fracture, she was later treated with heat and exercises after negative hip x-rays were obtained. Retrospective analysis of pelvic films and bone scan revealed a right pubic symphysis fracture. The third patient was an 83-year-old rheumatoid arthritic woman with inability to walk secondary to left groin pain. Pubic tomograms revealed disruption of the superior aspect, and bone scan showed increased uptake of the left pubic bone. She was treated with moist heat, rest, and NSAID. Twenty-four cases of os pubis fractures without major trauma or symphysis disruption have been reported. All patients had osteoporosis, and six had rheumatoid arthritis. Our three cases are presented to increase awareness of pubic symphysis fractures as a cause for groin pain, especially in patients with osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Twenty patients with neurogenic impotence, who were injured at least one year previously and who had a regular sexual partner, were evaluated. Erectile function was assessed by neurologic examination, patient and partner questionnaires, and snap-gauge evaluations. Overall, patient and partner assessments of device efficacy and sex life satisfaction with the device were very good to excellent. The device was simple to use and without significant side effects. In our initial experience, the Synergist system was an effective, safe, noninvasive alternative for the management of impotence secondary to cord injury.\r"

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a complex childhood malignancy with differing anatomic sites of presentation and varying histologic subtypes, each presenting with unique patterns of growth, making it inappropriate to consider the disease a single entity. Avenues of future research involve cytogenetic and molecular genetic investigations that will aid in diagnosis and screening and, it is hoped, guide clinicians to more specific therapy.\r"

Fourteen with ruptured HCCs underwent hepatic resection to control the intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Operative mortality within one month after surgery was 4.1%. The postoperative course was complicated by pleural effusion in 5.8%, subphrenic abscess in 2.5%, postoperative bleeding in 1.6%, hepatic failure in 1.6%, and bile leakage in 0.8% of the patients. The overall five-year survival rate in this series was 25.9%, while survival for the last five years was better (42.3% vs 11.9% for patients treated between 1977 and 1982). The cumulative survival rate had no relation to tumor rupture or liver cirrhosis. The group of patients with smaller tumors (diameter, less than 5 cm) or without vascular invasion by tumor had better survival.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of 81 consecutive patients with recurrent colorectal cancer was undertaken to evaluate the rationale and efficacy of surgical re-treatment. The disease-free interval after primary surgery and the diagnostic delay did not clearly differ between the modes of recurrences. Symptoms preceded the diagnosis of recurrence in 73% (59) of the cases, with pain being the most frequent symptom (n = 22). Of the patients, 58% (47) underwent reoperations, 38% (31) underwent reresections, and 10% (8) underwent radical resections. The overall postoperative mortality was 13%, and the postoperative morbidity was 45%. The postoperative relief of cancer symptoms after resective surgery was 8 months and, after nonresective surgery, 2 months. The median survival was 24 months for patients who underwent resections, 8 months for patients who were treated by nonresective surgery, and 15 months for patients who were treated conservatively. Radical resection clearly prolonged survival when compared with palliative resections and nonresective procedures. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that resective surgery, when possible, can improve survival and patient comfort after recurrence of colorectal cancer.\r"

Forty-nine patients had a major liver resection, 36 a segmentectomy, and 15 a nonanatomic liver resection. Great care was taken to avoid intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, including late ligation of the hepatic vein, the use of Kelly fracture and resorbable clips for hemostasis of transection planes in 74 patients, and temporary clamping of the portal pedicle in 22. Drainage of the abdomen was avoided in 21 patients to prevent ascitic leakage to decrease the postoperative hospital stay. Operative mortality was 1%. There were eight major complications, including one bile leak, one subphrenic abscess, and three subphrenic hematomas. The use of resorbable clips significantly reduced operative time and transfusion requirements. In patients with cirrhosis, temporary clamping of the hepatic pedicle significantly decreased blood loss. Avoiding drainage significantly decreased the postoperative hospital stay.\r"

Reasons in favor of routine screening include the following: (1) Knowledge of HIV status may allow the surgeon to decrease risk of infection. (2) The patient may benefit, because HIV infection may alter the risk-benefit ratio of a procedure. (3) Knowledge of HIV status will not affect how the patient is treated. Arguments against routine screening include the following: (1) Since the risk during individual procedures is low, it is unlikely that knowledge of HIV status can actually reduce risk. (2) Patient care may be negatively affected. (3) There is a possibility of false-positive results. (4) The accepted ethical standards of autonomy, confidentiality, and informed consent are not always adhered to. We explore these issues in detail. Recent work has framed the risk of surgeons and defined the reliability of diagnostic screening tests. All of these factors must be weighed before a surgeon can decide for or against a policy of routine preoperative screening.\r"

Of 38 patients who underwent common bile duct exploration, only 29 had stones. As operative time, morbidity, and cost were demonstrably increased in patients undergoing cholangiography, a selective approach is advocated. The number of unnecessary common bile duct explorations might be cut by almost half, while the incidence of finding clinically unsuspected yet significant common bile duct stones is negligible.\r"

Thirteen patients had concomitant cancer and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Six of the 13 patients had a history of thyroiditis before the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. The remaining seven patients had evidence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis on histologic review of the thyroid specimen. The two most common characteristics prompting surgical intervention were the presence of a nonsuppressing dominant nodule and a cold area on thyroid scan. Twelve patients underwent preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination, but only in three were the results considered to be indicative of cancer. All 13 patients remained disease free. Despite the apparent indolence of thyroid cancer associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, selective surgical treatment of patients with clinical thyroiditis is indicated.\r"

We studied the effects of adding low levels of PSV (5 to 10 cm H2O) in conjunction with intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) on 15 patients who required mechanical ventilation for flail chest and pulmonary contusion. Patients were selected for the study if, during weaning from IMV, the following criteria were met: (1) a PaCO2 level greater than 45 mm Hg, (2) a spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) greater than 30 breaths per minute, (3) a minute ventilation (VE) greater than 9.0 L/min, and (4) spontaneous tidal volumes (VT) of less than 2 mL/kg. The PSV was added to the IMV at a level that augmented spontaneous VT to greater than 4 mL/kg. An average of 9 +/- 3 cm H2O of pressure support resulted in a fall in the level of PaCO2 (50 +/- 4 to 43 +/- 5 mm Hg), spontaneous RR (36 +/- 5 to 16 +/- 3 breaths per minute), VE (12 +/- 2 to 8.4 +/- 1.5 L/min), and dead space-tidal volume ratio from (0.68 +/- 0.1 to 0.47 +/- 0.05). Mean airway pressure and PaO2 both increased, but these changes were not statistically significant. Oxygen consumption was also unchanged. These results suggest that in patients who are difficult to wean due to respiratory muscle fatigue (characterized by increasing RR and decreasing VT), PSV normalizes lung volumes, improves ventilation, and may expedite the weaning process.\r"

Transaxillary resection of the first and second ribs was curative in both cases. The operative specimens demonstrated fusion of the rudimentary first rib to the second rib, with compression of the subclavian artery by a large first-rib exostosis. Patients with thoracic outlet syndrome and a rudimentary first rib should be examined for substantial vascular compromise, and, if it is found, the abnormal first and second rib complex should be resected early without prolonged conservative measures.\r"

Compression of the caudal brain stem by an enlarged and tortuous vertebrobasilar arterial system may be the cause of downbeat nystagmus in some cases unassociated with more commonly recognized causes.\r"

The only lesions demonstrated on a magnetic resonance imaging scan were bilateral hemorrhages in the globus pallidus. The behavior change was characterized by apathy and lack of motivation, features commonly associated with bilateral frontal lobe disease. This case is a further demonstration of how subcortical lesions can produce behavioral syndromes that are clinically indistinguishable from classic cortical syndromes. It is cases such as this that show how a strict localizationist concept of behavioral function is too restrictive and how it is necessary to consider a wide network of neuronal interconnections when explaining the mechanism of a dissolution of complex higher functions.\r"

The patient's self-report may be the only way in which such information can be obtained. Depression and cognitive impairment, however, may influence that self-report. In the present study, three ratings of disability, from the patient, a relative, and an independent observer, showed high levels of agreement. The patients' cognitive function made a small but significant contribution to the accuracy of their self-report judged against the relative's rating. Depression, however, played no role. Agreement between patients and relatives for individual items on the disability questionnaire was reasonably high. The results suggest that patients with parkinsonism can provide accurate self-report of their level of disability, even in the presence of depression and cognitive impairment.\r"

All cases had a chronic neuropathy of the neuronal/axonal type with little, presumably secondary, demyelination. There was predominant reduction of the large-caliber population of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers. The number of dense-cored vesicles in unmyelinated and small myelinated fibers was increased. Abnormal mitochondria in Schwann cells with paracrystalline inclusions, prominent cristae including paracrystalline material (cases 1 and 2), and axonal mitochondria with presumable hydroxyapatite crystals (case 3) were found. The morphologic results suggest that hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with optic atrophy should be regarded as a separate entity within the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy group.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolic basis of the encephalopathy associated with acute bacterial meningitis is unknown. The presence of cerebrospinal fluid lactic acidosis and hypoglycorrhachia suggests that intracellular acidosis or cellular energy depletion may play a role. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows for the noninvasive determination of intracellular pH and relative amounts of phosphate-containing metabolites in humans. In seven normal volunteers, the intracellular pH of a mixed volume of gray and white matter was 7.00 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- SD). The apparent relative intensities of resonances from adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, phosphodiesters and phosphomonoesters, and inorganic phosphate were measured. An encephalopathic patient with pneumococcal meningitis who had severe cerebrospinal fluid lactic acidosis was studied. Brain intracellular pH and relative phosphate metabolite concentrations were normal. Intracellular acidosis and bioenergetic compromise are therefore not causes of encephalopathy in this disease. This also demonstrates that the human brain can maintain tight control of intracellular pH even in the presence of marked extracellular metabolic acidosis.\r"

The time to egress from the ventricular system into the basal cisterns was variable but generally short. One hour after administration, the basal cisterns were clearly visible in all patients. Thereafter, kinetics throughout the cranial and spinal subarachnoid space were consistent. The flow patterns of three patients cured of meningeal dissemination and one patient with mild meningeal leukemia were similar to the normal pattern.\r"
