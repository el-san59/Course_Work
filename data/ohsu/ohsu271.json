  ".W": "To examine whether proteoglycans (PGs) liberated from cartilage might contribute to articular changes in arthritis, cartilage PGs were injected intraarticularly into rabbit knee joints. Twice-weekly injections of PG (2.5 mg) provoked synovial hypertrophy, synovitis, erosion of the articulating surfaces, and loss of metachromasia of the articular cartilage. These changes were accompanied by a marked elevation in the production of neutral collagenase and gelatinase by both synoviocytes and chondrocytes. The synoviocytes of experimental knee joints also produced factor(s), possibly related to interleukin-1, which provoked the activation of chondrocytes. Our data are consistent with the idea that free PG fragments mediate some of the pathophysiologic changes that occur in arthritic joints. This property may be particularly important in osteoarthritis.\r"

The lumen either consisted of a single tube or was subdivided into several tubules. The distal part of the ES overlapped the SS in one third of the specimens. The results indicate that a minute extraosseous ES could explain the sometimes difficult task of localizing this structure at ES surgery. The great variability in size might perhaps also explain the varying results of this surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic moisture is a major cause of chronic otitis externa (COE). Moisture combined with inadequate lubrication of the stratum corneum and retention of keratin debris promote bacterial and fungal growth. In most cases of COE, creating a well-aerated, dry, self-cleaning external auditory canal prevents further infection. This can usually be accomplished by medical treatment that includes suction and swabbing. Antibiotic-steroid ear drops control infection and inflammation. Alcohol flush and warm-air ventilation dry the canal, and a hydrophobic cream lubricates and seals the stratum corneum from moisture, fungus, and bacteria. An anatomic variation, a narrow external auditory meatus leading to poor ventilation, is frequently associated with COE, which does not respond to conventional therapy. A previously unreported simple lateral conchomeatoplasty is presented. No other described meatoplasty corrects both the conchal cartilage projection and inadequate meatal skin circumference which, together, cause the small meatus. The lateral conchomeatoplasty has been used by this author for over 20 years on 35 ears. All patients showed improvement; most had complete control.\r"

However, the occurrence of false-positive responses limits its usefulness. Therefore, we believe that the 512-Hz tuning fork should become the standard tuning fork used in performance of the Rinne test to screen patients for conductive hearing loss.\r"

The type 1 fiber population was smaller in diameter (mean +/- SD, 14 +/- 4 microns) than the type 2A fiber (mean +/- SD, 21 +/- 5 microns) and the type 3 fiber (mean +/- SD, 22 +/- 6 microns) populations. In all muscles, intrafascicular and extrafascicular fat accumulations were found, with the majority being extrafascicular. Calculations indicate that the tendon occupies approximately 41% of the total muscle volume, while the muscle fibers constitute 59% of the volume.\r"

Obstructions 5 x 15 mm protruding 1 to 5 mm into the nasal lumen were applied to the septum in untreated and decongested nasal cavities. The most resistive septal site was located opposite the caudal edge of the upper lateral cartilage where a 3-mm deviation increased resistance substantially in untreated noses, but produced no resistive effect when the mucosa was decongested, whereas a 4-mm deviation increased resistance severely at this site in untreated and decongested noses. Deviations at the caudal end of the septum that overlapped the upper lateral cartilage were markedly resistive also, while near the cavum they were less resistive. Decongestion reduced resistance and length of this anterior-resistive nasal segment. By contrast, within the cavum neither deviations of 5 mm nor mucosal status affected resistance. It is concluded that airflow resistance of the nasal cavum is unresponsive to septal deviations and mucosal status, but the anterior part of the nose is most susceptible and differences of 1 mm in lumen can be critical.\r"

Caval resistance was unaffected by simulated maxillary crest spurs, 30 x 5 x 5 mm, in either vascular state. Between inferior turbinate and anterior naris, 5-mm septal protrusions from floor to roof increased resistance severely, but when shortened by one third, their resistive effects were markedly decreased, especially when positioned near the roof. The cavum can accommodate large septal spurs, deviations, and congested mucosa with little effect on airflow resistance. By contrast, resistance of the anterior nasal airway beyond the inferior turbinate bone is acutely responsive to changes in mucosal congestion and to septal protrusions, especially when they are situated near the floor of the nose.\r"

Between 1974 and 1983 in our institution, 139 patients with supraglottic carcinoma of intermediate size were judged retrospectively to have been technically amenable to conservation surgery. Primary disease control at three years was achieved in 100% of the patients treated by supraglottic laryngectomy, 91% (34 patients) of those treated by total laryngectomy, and 69% (81 patients) of those treated by radiotherapy. Of the latter group, 62% were salvaged by total laryngectomy yielding a net three-year local control of 85%. Determinate five-year survival rates were 89% for supraglottic laryngectomy, 78% for total laryngectomy, and 70% for radiotherapy. Significant problems with aspiration occurred in four patients (16%) who were treated by conservation surgery, and two patients (8%) required a permanent tracheostomy. The results of this study show that supraglottic laryngectomy with postoperative radiotherapy as indicated is a highly effective method for the local control of supraglottic carcinoma of intermediate size that is amenable to conservation surgery.\r"

The UM-SCC cell lines were used at low passages (passage 13 to passage 20) to minimize artifacts attributable to long-term culture. Cells were irradiated in suspension using a cobalt 60 gamma source at a dose rate of 0.94 Gy/min (94 rad/min). Survival data were fitted well by either a linear quadratic function F = e-(alpha D + beta D2) or by a monoexponential function F = Ae-alpha D. Mean inactivation dose, equivalent to the area under the survival curve (AUC), was used as a measure of radiation sensitivity. The UM-SCC-1, 9, 11A, 11B, MCF-7, and HeLa were the most radiation resistant lines we tested (AUC greater than 2.1), while UM-SCC-14A was the most sensitive (AUC = 1.591).

Physicians and the public are increasingly aware of minimally invasive methods of early diagnosis of thyroid malignancy, such as fine-needle aspiration with cytologic examination. Total thyroidectomy itself has become less associated with morbidity than it once was. We describe three patients with follicular thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the skull who were seen recently. Two of these patients had masses neglected for 20 and 50 years, respectively. The management of this disease entity is discussed.\r"

Treatment with the base cream resulted in a reduction in renewal time compared with an untreated control site. The predicted increase in renewal time with the hypomitotic agent and reduction with the hypermitotic agent was only observed when daily treatment was commenced 2 weeks prior to and continued after dansyl chloride staining and not when treatment was started after staining. These results indicate that in order to use cell renewal methods to demonstrate changes in mitotic activity brought about by topical treatments, it is necessary to pre-treat the skin with the test material to establish full epidermal equilibrium at the changed mitotic state before labelling with dansyl chloride. Meaningful claims for effects on cell renewal of specific cosmetic ingredients should only be made after comparison with a base cream treated site, both having been allowed to equilibrate, rather than on the basis of comparison with untreated skin.\r"

Fifty five percent of patients had never experienced a complete remission from their psoriasis. A large percentage of patients avoided common social activities, for example swimming and sports; 50% felt that psoriasis had inhibited their sexual relationships and 11% of patients said they would avoid having children in case their offspring should develop the condition. Thirty-six per cent felt the hospital doctor spent most of the consultation time writing prescriptions and 59% of patients had never been given an explanatory pamphlet or book about psoriasis. To help patients to come to terms with what is for many a lifelong condition, greater efforts should be made to improve the communication at consultation, and provide more patient education.\r"

The progress of lesions prior to excision was monitored by tracing an area of the upper back onto a transparent acetate sheet. This template was used the next day, and in some cases after 3 days, to identify inflamed lesions of less than 1 day and 2-3 days duration. These were biopsied, and pilosebaceous units isolated by micro-dissection, homogenized and microbial populations studied by viable counting and microscopy. Propionibacteria colonised 68% of '1 day' duration lesions and 79% of '3 day' duration lesions; staphylococci colonized 19% and 32% respectively and Pityrosporum spp. (Malassezia furfur) were found in 52% and 68%. Although the prevalence of each microbial group was higher in the more chronic lesions, these differences were not statistically significant. The microbial profile of inflamed lesions was similar both qualitatively and quantitatively to non-inflamed lesions studied previously. These results call into question the role of micro-organisms as the initiators of inflammation in acne vulgaris.\r"

The ratio of type A:type B was approximately 3:I. Onset of type A vitiligo could occur at any age, whereas type B generally affected the young. The activity of type B vitiligo usually ceased after one year, following rapid spread over the particular dermatomal area. However, in type A vitiligo new depigmented patches continued to appear throughout the patients' lives. Association with halo naevus and Kobner's phenomenon were observed exclusively in type A. Association with diseases with a proven or suggested allergic or immunological aetiology was more often found in type A. These findings support our hypothesis that type A and type B vitiligo have a different pathogenesis and that autoimmune mechanisms play a role only in type A.\r"

Occasionally positive patch test reactions at 20 min, 2 h and 6 h were also observed. Patch test reactions were not found in normal controls or atopic patients without atopic dermatitis. Analysis of the cellular infiltrate demonstrated an influx of eosinophils into the dermis, starting from 2-6 h after patch testing. Immunostaining with antibodies against granular constituents of the eosinophils revealed that the infiltrating eosinophils were in an activated state and had lost part of their granular contents. At 24 h eosinophils also appeared in the epidermis. Electron microscopy showed that in the epidermis, some eosinophils were in close contact with Langerhans cells, suggesting a cell-cell interaction. Taken together, these results strongly suggest an active role for eosinophils in patch test reactions to inhalant allergens in atopic dermatitis patients.\r"

In the untreated women no spontaneous uterine contractility was recorded and the response to 0.25 mg 16-phenoxy-PGE2 was characterized by an increase in uterine tonus with superimposed irregular contractions of low amplitude. Treatment with 25 mg RU 486 twice daily resulted in the appearance of regular uterine contractions at 24 h in two out of five patients and in all patients at 36, 48 and 72 h after the start of RU 486 treatment. The withdrawal of progesterone influence changed the inactive early pregnant uterus into an active organ. Administration of 16-phenoxy-PGE2 caused an obvious stimulation of both frequency and amplitude of the contractions. In addition, the significantly increased sensitivity to the prostaglandin analogue, but not to oxytocin, was already apparent 24 h after the start of RU 486 treatment. We have previously shown that the addition of one intramuscular injection of 16-phenoxy-PGE2 on the fourth day of treatment with RU 486 (25 mg twice daily) significantly increased the abortifacient effect of the antiprogestin during early pregnancy. The present study suggests that a shorter treatment may be possible.\r"

There were no differences between the two groups in respect of parity, number of vaginal deliveries or birthweight of the heaviest baby. The group with competent urethral sphincter mechanisms did show some evidence to implicate an increased number of vaginal deliveries in poor function of the distal part of the urethral sphincter mechanism.\r"

Women with pelvic pain and congestion had a mean age of 32.4 years, were more often multiparous and had had symptoms for 6 months to 20 years. The pain was dull and aching with sharp exacerbations. In individual women it commonly occurred on one side of the abdomen but unlike the pain due to 'classical pathology', it could occur on the other side. The pain was exacerbated by postural changes, and walking. Congestive dysmenorrhoea, deep dyspareunia and postcoital ache were common findings in women with pelvic congestion and 60% had evidence of significant emotional disturbance. The combination of tenderness on abdominal palpation over the ovarian point and a history of postcoital ache was 94% sensitive and 77% specific for discriminating pelvic congestion from other causes of pelvic pain.\r"

Median PGE receptor concentrations were significantly higher in the women with menorrhagia (1077 fmol/mg protein) than in the women with normal menstrual blood loss (625 fmol/mg protein) and correlated with menstrual blood loss (P less than 0.02). These findings suggest that unexplained menorrhagia may simply be a constitutional variant in some women and that specific and potent PGE uterine receptor antagonists would furnish effective non-surgical treatment for unexplained menorrhagia.\r"

The most pronounced decrease in magnitude and incidence of astigmatism occurred between the first and second year of life.

The microbial pathogenesis in these patients was distinctive; coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha- and beta-streptococci, moraxellae, enteric Gram-negative bacilli, and polymicrobial infections were unusually prominent. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was uncommon. Trauma, exposure, bullous keratopathy, other external ocular diseases, and self-neglect were the major recognised predisposing causes. The nutritional, toxic and immunological sequelae of alcoholism may also have been contributory. Ophthalmologists should be alert to the diagnosis of chronic alcoholism in their patients. Chronic alcoholism may be an important and underrated risk factor for microbial keratitis.\r"

The time course of the disease was monitored by electroretinography (ERG), and the ERG changes were correlated with clinical signs and underlying pathological damage. The ERG became supernormal in the third week after inoculation, with some loss of temporal resolution (lowered ERG flicker fusion frequency), though the disease was not clinically manifest at this time and histological examination was normal. The ERG became subnormal after 21 days as clinical signs of disease began to appear. This subnormality was associated with focal photoreceptor necrosis, the degree of destruction being proportional to the reduction in the ERG. The ERG recovered with resolution of disease in most cases, though return to control values was uncommon. We suggest that the initial supernormal ERG reflects an underlying biochemical change mediated by the action of anti retinal S-antigen antibodies.\r"

We have used a new radionuclide technique to quantify proximal, distal and total stomach emptying of a digestible solid meal (100 g of 99Tcm-labelled liver/ground beef given with 150 ml of 10% dextrose) in 13 normal subjects. A proximal reservoir area was seen after consumption of the meal, and used to define the proximal stomach region. A line drawn immediately below this area divided the total stomach region into proximal and distal stomach. Emptying from the total stomach exhibited two phases--an initial lag period (median 41 min, range 21-57 min), followed by approximately linear emptying. Redistribution of food from the proximal to the distal stomach was a major component of the lag period in 11 of the 13 subjects. In the remaining two subjects, redistribution was rapid (proximal 50% emptying time of 4 and 10 min) and antral retention was the major component of the lag period. In seven subjects, a region of reduced activity (contraction band) was seen. The midpoint of this band closely approximated to the line used to divide proximal and distal stomach. We suggest that a contraction band may be responsible for the proximal gastric reservoir seen after meal consumption and plays an important role in the redistribution and emptying of digestible solid food from the stomach. There is considerable variation between normal subjects in the rate of transfer of digestible solid food from the proximal to the distal stomach.\r"

These groups of microcalcifications were analysed to determine whether there was any quantitative difference between benign and malignant lesions with respect to a shape parameter of the group, the spatial frequency of the particles and neighbour-to-neighbour relationships of the particles. This analysis did not reveal any significant difference between the spatial relationships of the grouped microcalcifications found in benign and malignant breast disease.\r"

The influence of age, sex and oral contraceptive usage on bone marrow T1 was assessed. Differences observed between the T1 of the various regions of the bone marrow examined were consistent with the expected distribution of erythropoietic cells and fatty marrow. Bone marrow T1 was found to decrease with age, significantly lower mean T1 values being observed in subjects over 40 years of age than for those in the 20-40 years age group. The mean bone marrow T1 of females in the 20-40 years age group was significantly higher than that for males of comparable age. For subjects over 40 years of age, the difference in bone marrow T1 observed between males and females was not significant. Oral contraceptive usage had no effect on bone marrow T1.\r"

Each patient received only one of the four agents, which were allocated on a random basis. Urovison produced the greatest number of ADRs. Iopamiro caused the least. No significant correlation between the magnitude of the change in plasma histamine following injection of radiographic contrast medium and the production of a particular ADR could be demonstrated. Heart rate increased significantly following the administration of Urovison, Hexabrix and Iopamiro in the absence of any appreciable change in blood pressure. These results and our earlier findings would favour the use of the low-osmolality contrast media in intravenous urography to minimize ADRs, histamine release and patient discomfort.\r"

  ".W": "The existing National Health Service financial system makes comprehensive costing of any service very difficult. A method of costing using modern commercial methods has been devised, classifying costs into variable, semi-variable and fixed and using the principle of overhead absorption for expenditure not readily allocated to individual procedures. It proved possible to establish a cost spectrum over the financial year 1984-85. The cheapest examinations were plain radiographs outside normal working hours, followed by plain radiographs, ultrasound, special procedures, fluoroscopy, nuclear medicine, angiography and angiographic interventional procedures in normal working hours. This differs from some published figures, particularly those in the Korner report. There was some overlap between fluoroscopic interventional and the cheaper nuclear medicine procedures, and between some of the more expensive nuclear medicine procedures and the cheaper angiographic ones. Only angiographic and the few more expensive nuclear medicine procedures exceed the cost of the inpatient day. The total cost of the imaging service to the district was about 4% of total hospital expenditure. It is shown that where more procedures are undertaken, the semi-variable and fixed (including capital) elements of the cost decrease (and vice versa) so that careful study is required to assess the value of proposed economies. The method is initially time-consuming and requires a computer system with 512 Kb of memory, but once the basic costing system is established in a department, detailed financial monitoring should become practicable. The necessity for a standard comprehensive costing procedure of this nature, based on sound cost accounting principles, appears inescapable, particularly in view of its potential application to management budgeting.\r"

Aetiological factors included post-menopausal osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and steroid therapy, previous hip replacement and pelvic radiotherapy. Ten patients had concomitant fractures of the pelvis, including nine with sacral fractures. These were all initially missed on presentation because of the subtle radiographic signs of a longitudinal band of sclerosis, usually bilaterally, in the sacral ala. Bone scanning was shown to be the most sensitive technique in detecting the sacral fractures by demonstrating increased uptake in the sacral ala as well as the other fractures of the pelvis. Computed tomography in three cases was helpful in confirming the presence of fractures and excluding the possibility of malignancy.\r"

Changes consistent with repopulation were evident between the 14th and 18th day after irradiation. The severity of cell depletion and the rate of recovery of the epidermis were dose dependent. The regenerative phase was characterized by an increased cell proliferation; values for the labelling index (LI) were greater than those in the non-irradiated epidermis, from 14 days after 15 Gy and from 18 days after 20 Gy. The LI was still elevated at the end of the observation period, i.e. Day 56. No change in the time for DNA synthesis was found. Eighteen days after 15 Gy and 22 days after 20 Gy, islands of cells (colonies), with an appearance similar to the cells in the normal epidermis, were seen. The minimum turnover time (TT) for the proliferating cells of the basal layer of the epidermis in radiation-damaged skin was 61-68 h as compared with 125 h in unirradiated skin.

  ".W": "The ability of d(42 Mev)-Be neutrons and 250 kV X rays to produce sister-chromatid exchanges (SCE) has been re-examined using unstimulated (G0) human-blood lymphocytes. Contrary to a previous report, the neutrons produced a significant and dose-dependent increase in SCE. X rays, as previously, produced no measurable increase at any absorbed dose. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for this end-point is therefore undefined and effectively infinite. In contrast to the findings of many workers, the between-cell distributions of SCE were, in most cases, underdispersed. This could imply that the SCE burden of a cell was not selectively neutral in these experiments.\r"

True supersaturation ratios were calculated by allowing for complexation in solution. Magnesium inhibited the nucleation rate at all oxalate concentrations. It also inhibited the growth rate at oxalate concentrations of less than approximately 2.0 mmol/l but promoted the growth rate at higher concentrations. This suggests that, provided the oxalate concentration is sufficiently high, increase of magnesium concentration can increase the crystal growth rate. At physiological concentrations of oxalate, however, magnesium decreases both nucleation and growth rates. The SEM photographs showed that the predominant crystal was calcium oxalate trihydrate at low magnesium concentrations, with calcium oxalate dihydrate being observed in larger quantities at high magnesium concentrations.\r"

Ninety-one patients with a superficial tumour were followed up for a mean of 24 months. Grade 2a tumours recurred later and in fewer patients than grade 2b tumours. Progression was seen in 4% of grade 2a tumours and in 33% of grade 2b carcinomas. Adapting our results to the WHO grading system, we suggest that all tumours in this study defined as grades 1 and 2a should be classified as low grade and tumours defined as grade 2b should be classified as intermediate grade.\r"

Low grade tumours appeared to have hypodiploid or peridiploid chromosomal numbers. Intermediate grade tumours were characterised by chromosomal counts up to the hyperdiploid range but could have a peridiploid modal number. In high grade tumours the modal number was hyperdiploid. The range in chromosomal counts appeared to be more reliable than the modal number as a predictor of the course of superficial tumours. The significant difference in chromosome numbers between low, intermediate and high grade tumours indicates that grading reflects major cytogenetic changes in the tumour cells.\r"

Pathognomic features of examination were an elevated or ectopic testis in 50% of cases of testicular torsion and a palpable tender blue nodule in 21% of cases of torsion of a testicular appendage. We believe that it is often possible to distinguish between these two conditions and, where this is possible, a trial of conservative management is justified for torsion of a testicular appendage.\r"

Twenty patients were selected for conservative treatment and 26 for surgery (including 17 postanal repairs and 6 anterior sphincter repairs). The degree of incontinence was scored before and after treatment and postoperative investigations carried out on 17 patients (11 postanal repairs). Forty per cent of the conservative treatment group had a successful result compared with sixty-five per cent of the operative group as a whole and fifty-nine per cent of the postanal repair patients. Resting and 'squeeze' anal canal pressures were improved following postanal repair as was upper anal canal sensation but there was no change in the anorectal angle. We conclude that the anorectal angle is not crucial in maintaining continence.\r"

R1 gastrectomy was performed in 73 of the 78 resections. The operative mortality after gastric resection was 4 per cent, but there were no deaths after potentially curative resections. The actuarial 5-year survival was 20 per cent overall, 60 per cent in patients undergoing a 'curative' resection with N0 disease, and 18 per cent in patients with N1 disease. Local or regional recurrence without evidence of distant metastases was identified in 11 per cent of cases after 'curative' resections. The probability of survival was adversely affected by N1 nodal involvement (P less than 0.005) and by the presence of poorly differentiated or anaplastic tumours (P less than 0.001). Only 6 per cent of patients had early gastric cancer, and absolute curative resections by Japanese criteria were possible in only 5 per cent of cases. The results suggest that the unfavourable presenting pathology is the principal determinant of the poor prognosis of gastric cancer. A more radical or extended lymphadenectomy (R2/3 gastrectomy) might have cured more patients with N1 metastases, but only 12 per cent of potentially curable patients had N1 disease in this study, and it appears that more radical surgery may have little effect on the overall survival rates for gastric cancer.\r"

Seven patients had final histological stages in excess of the protocol. The R2 group had a longer operating time (P less than 0.005), a greater blood transfusion requirement (P less than 0.005), a longer hospital stay (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.025) and required reoperation in four cases. There were no postoperative deaths. Four patients have died from the disease in the R1 group and five in the R2 group, there being no difference in the probability of survival at a median follow-up of 3.1 years. The small proportion of patients suitable for radical R2 surgery, the high associated morbidity and the fact that survival advantage has yet to be proven in trial suggest that this procedure should not yet be performed outside of controlled clinical trials.\r"

In normal circumstances mucosal defects in the oesophagus regenerate by squamous epithelium. In the presence of gastro-oesophageal reflux of either acid or a combination of acid and bile, regeneration was frequently by columnar epithelium (Barrett's oesophagus). This columnar regeneration was not seen with bile reflux alone. By the use of squamous barriers to proximal migration of columnar epithelium in the stomach, it was demonstrated that columnar re-epithelialization may occur from cells intrinsic to the oesophagus and is not dependent on proximal migration of cardiac columnar epithelium. The cell of origin of this epithelium may be located in oesophageal gland ducts and is likely to be a multipotential stem cell since the regenerated columnar epithelium may contain goblet and parietal cells not normally found in the oesophagus. This epithelium is morphologically distinct on mucin histochemistry from cardiac columnar epithelium. These findings support the concept that Barrett's epithelium is metaplastic.\r"

We have used 'left upper abdominal evisceration plus Appleby's method (LUAE + Apl.)' as a radical surgical procedure for this disease. During the period 1983-86, 30 cases of Borrmann type 4 gastric carcinoma underwent this procedure (Group A). These cases were compared with 30 patients who underwent total gastrectomy with pancreaticosplenectomy (Group B) during the period 1980-82. Although this is not a randomized study and the extent of resection was greater in Group A, the operation time, amount of blood loss, and number of complications were similar for both methods. When the survival rates were compared, the 3-year survival rate in stage II-III cases was higher for Group A (83.3 per cent) than for Group B (42.2 per cent) (P less than 0.05). One patient in Group A and 12 patients in Group B died with peritoneal metastasis within 3 years of operation in stage II-III. The LUAE + Apl. method is a rational and useful technique for the surgical treatment of Borrmann type 4 gastric carcinoma.\r"

Two years after the operation satisfactory clinical results (Visick I + II) were found in 84.2 per cent of the patients after PGV and in 88.9 per cent after ASPTV. There was a significant difference in the duration of surgery. No serious postoperative gastric sequelae were encountered after either operation. Up till January 1987, eight endoscopically proven, symptomatic recurrent ulcers have been diagnosed: four in the PGV group (9.3 per cent) and four in the ASPTV group (8.7 per cent).

  ".W": "We have recently found that an impairment of the wound healing response (WHR) occurs in surgical patients with protein-energy malnutrition before there are any measurable changes in body fat and protein stores. The hypothesis of this study was that the patients' recent food intake is more important in determining the WHR than the patients' overall nutritional status. We have measured the recent food intake (by dietary recall), the WHR (by hydroxyproline accumulation in subcutaneous GORE-TEX implants), the pre-operative weight loss (per cent), and body fat and protein stores (by in vivo neutron activation analysis) in 83 patients awaiting a major elective gastrointestinal resection, and divided them into two groups: adequate recent food intake (n = 59) and inadequate recent food intake (n = 24). There was no significant difference between these two groups for age, sex, diagnosis, surgical procedure, weight loss (per cent), or the amount of body fat and protein stores but there was a significant difference in the WHR (1.81 +/- 0.16 s.e.m. versus 1.04 +/- 0.22 s.e.m. nmol hydroxyproline/mg GORE-TEX, P less than 0.005). These results show that pre-operative food intake has a greater influence over the wound healing response than absolute losses of protein and fat from body stores and they suggest that the maintenance of a normal food intake up until the time of surgery is of importance in preventing an impairment of the wound healing response.\r"

Of these 236 cholecystectomies, 195 were performed for acute cholecystitis and 41 for acute gallstone pancreatitis. In the acute cholecystitis group the proportion of patients over 70 years of age was significantly higher (35 per cent) than the corresponding elective group (10.3 per cent). Of those patients presenting with complications (empyema, gangrene, perforation, and biliary peritonitis) 51 per cent were over the age of 70 years. The most valuable investigation in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was ultrasound carried out within the first 48 h, with positive results in 83 per cent of those examined. The mortality for elective cholecystectomy was 0.5 per cent rising to 4.7 per cent in the urgent/early cholecystectomy group. The mean age of the 11 patients who died was 76 years, 8 of these patients being over the age of 70 years. The mortality in the subgroup of patients over 70 years was 10 per cent rising to 20 per cent in the over-80 age group. There were no deaths in the acute gallstone pancreatitis group. We conclude that emergency or early cholecystectomy is a safe procedure in patients under 70 years of age. However, patients over 70 years present with more serious complications of acute gallbladder disease which necessitate urgent surgery. We therefore recommend early cholecystectomy in patients over 70 years despite the high attendant mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The combination of ceruletide-induced relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi plus flushing with saline has recently been proposed as a novel procedure for the treatment of residual common bile duct (CBD) stones. In this study we have administered intravenous ceruletide (2 ng kg-1 body weight min-1 for 1 h) plus intraductal saline (800-3000 ml, infused at a rate that kept biliary pressure below 30 cmH2O) to a group of 14 patients. The treatment induced the passage of residual stones in 11 subjects (79 per cent) with complete clearance in 7 (50 per cent). The majority of the cleared concretions (11/15) had a diameter less than 10 mm. No severe side-effects were recorded during the treatment. Four of the seven subjects who exhibited incomplete CBD clearance underwent a short cycle of mono-octanoin administration in order to reduce the size of residual radiolucent stones. This course of treatment was followed by another attempt with intravenous ceruletide and saline washout which gave a successful response in an additional three cases. These data indicate that the combination of ceruletide and flushing is a safe and inexpensive method for treatment of residual stones. The procedure is feasible for both radiolucent and radio-opaque stones and is mainly eligible for small concretions of diameter less than 10 mm. Larger (greater than 10 mm) radiolucent stones may be partially dissolved with mono-octanoin and then eliminated by the washout technique.\r"

Two members in the third generation have been successfully managed by total pancreatectomy. A MEN-1 patient with malignant pancreatic tumours should be considered for total pancreatectomy if the pancreatic disease has caused high morbidity and mortality within the family.

Tumour diameter was frequently greater in patients with leiomyosarcoma. The surgical mortality was 2.8 per cent after treatment of leiomyoma and 10.3 per cent after treatment of leiomyosarcoma. After resection of leiomyosarcoma the 2-year survival rate was 86 per cent and the 5-year survival rate was 43 per cent. The only hope of cure of these malignant lesions lies in surgical resection but, even when the lesion is incurable, resection may allow worthwhile palliation.\r"

There was no statistically significant correlation between size of the primary tumour and interval from surgery to detection of recurrence (r = -0.09). Serial measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was useful for the detection of recurrences. However, the levels of AFP seem to be a non-specific, unreliable test for such patients since this tumour marker showed different ranges before the primary surgery and at the time of recurrence in 5 of the 41 patients (12 per cent). Postoperative chemotherapy with oral 5-fluorouracil had no apparent preventative effect on the recurrence. A second curative resection was effective in four patients, and three survived for over 2 years; the longest survival time is 9 years after the second procedure.\r"

In the same period 567 patients with oedematous-interstitial pancreatitis were treated non-operatively with a hospital mortality rate of 0.7 per cent. In patients with necrotizing pancreatitis the median Ranson criteria score was 4.5 points; operation was required at a median of 7 days after the onset of symptoms because of non-response to conservative treatment. In all, 59 per cent of the patients (56 out of 95) developed extended intrapancreatic parenchymal necrosis, 70 per cent had ascites, and 66 per cent had intra- and extrapancreatic necrosis; 42 per cent of the patients had bacterial infection of the necrotic tissue. For lavage a median of 8 l/24 h of fluid were instilled postoperatively for 25 days (median). The lavage fluid showed high levels of immunoreactive trypsin, phospholipase A2, and endotoxin in the early postoperative period. Hospital mortality rate was 8.4 per cent. Necrosectomy and continuous postoperative lavage can achieve high survival rates in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. Postoperative local lavage allows the continuous non-operative evacuation of biologically active compounds and devitalized tissue, and avoids damage to remaining vital exocrine and endocrine pancreatic tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Three clinicobiochemical systems have been proposed for predicting gallstones in acute pancreatitis based on one, three and five factors respectively, but have not been compared in a single prospective study. System 1 is based on the serum transaminase alone; system 2 uses alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin in addition to transaminase; and system 3 involves female gender, age, amylase and alkaline phosphatase in addition to transaminase. Over the 4-year period 1983-86, 368 patients with 391 episodes of acute pancreatitis had clinicobiochemical analysis within 48 h. Of these episodes, 220 were related to gallstones (56 per cent), 62 to alcohol (16 per cent) and 109 to other aetiologies or were idiopathic (28 per cent). Significant differences were found between the biliary and non-biliary groups with respect to sex (139 versus 59 women, P less than 0.002), age (65 +/- 17 versus 52 +/- 19 years, P less than 0.0001) and serum amylase (6041 +/- 6335 versus 4546 +/- 3990 units/l, P less than 0.0001), alkaline phosphatase (257 +/- 225 versus 141 +/- 137 units/l, P less than 0.0001), alanine transaminase (221 +/- 227 versus 72 +/- 119 units/l, P less than 0.0001) and bilirubin (40 +/- 39 versus 24 +/- 30 mumol/l, P = 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity was 75 per cent and 74 per cent for the one-factor system, 74 per cent and 78 per cent for the three-factor system and 62 per cent and 80 per cent for the five-factor system. The predictive value of a positive result was 78.8 per cent, 81.5 per cent and 80.1 per cent and of a negative result 69.4 per cent, 70.1 per cent and 62.3 per cent for the three systems respectively. The performances of the one- and three-factor systems were marginally better than that of the five-factor system; the one-factor system, however, had the advantage of simplicity.\r"

There was one postoperative death in the PJ group and none in the PG group. All patients were followed up for a minimum of four years. There was significantly greater pain relief in the PG group both at 1 (P less than 0.01) and 4 years (P less than 0.05) after surgery. We argue that PG is the operation of choice to relieve intractable pain in most patients with chronic pancreatitis associated with duct dilatation.\r"

In a prospective series of 100 patients, 70 were treated non-operatively. Thirty patients were operated upon, twenty-one immediately and nine during the 48 h observation period. In five laparotomies no significant injuries were found. Morbidity was similar in both immediate and delayed laparotomy groups (3/21 versus 1/9). Acute alcoholic intoxication identifies a subgroup of patients that are difficult to evaluate and hence are more likely to be managed by laparotomy (chi 2 = 4.056, P less than 0.05). The authors conclude that selective surgical management of PASW based on clinical criteria is an accurate and safe procedure.\r"

One patient died from exsanguination on the operating table, before any repair was possible. The overall mortality was 20 per cent and the mean hospital stay 6.1 days. Thirty-five per cent of the patients presented with neurological complications, and 55 per cent left the hospital well. No advantage of Henry's classical approach over limited exposure and control with metal clips was shown, when mortality, hospital stay and long-term problems were compared. Because of its relative simplicity we suggest that the metal clipping of the vertebral artery, above and below the site of injury, is an effective technique that can be used to stop the bleeding. One case presented as a false aneurysm of the vertebral artery, following a stab wound. This was successfully treated with excision of the aneurysm and vertebrovertebral artery bypass, using a saphenous vein graft.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-eight patients with documented mesenteric infarction during a 19-year period were reviewed. In 13 patients infarction was due to a mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT). Patients with MVT distinguished themselves from those having another aetiology by: (1) longer history of pain before admission (median 8 days, P less than 0.0001); (2) typical appearance of the bowel at laparotomy (10/13); (3) a localized segment of ischaemic jejunum or ileum of less than 120 cm in length (12/13) allowing better operability at the first laparotomy (P = 0.006). In hospital the mortality was lower for venous mesenteric infarction (5/13, 38 per cent) than for mesenteric infarction of other aetiologies (70/85, 82 per cent) (P = 0.002). Patients with primary venous mesenteric infarction showed a better survival rate (one death in eight patients) than patients with associated diseases such as liver cirrhosis, sepsis or previous operation who had a poor prognosis with a mortality comparable to other aetiologies of acute bowel ischaemia (four deaths in five patients). Since the high recurrence rate of this disease in the early postoperative period was due to residual venous thrombosis and to a hypercoagulable state, a wide bowel resection is recommended followed by early and long-term anticoagulation. Thrombectomy is probably inefficient since it removes only centrally located thrombi and leaves peripheral occlusion, which is responsible for the recurrence.\r"

Almost all of the ulcers occurred in patients between 20 and 50 years of age, with a peak incidence between 40 and 45 years. The younger the patient at the onset of the disease, the later the first ulcer occurred, and the later the first ulcer occurred, the shorter the period in which ulceration may recur. Recurrent ulcers were observed in 45 per cent of the patients. The progression of symptoms was influenced by smoking, but this was not the only deleterious factor as there were patients with stable TAO unaffected by smoking. In the 30 patients over the age of 60 years, ulceration and gangrene were not observed. In all patients, the progression of symptoms was self-limited and recurrent ulcers occurred less frequently with ageing. The rate of major amputation was low (3.9 per cent) although minor digital amputations were sometimes required. The survival rate of patients with TAO was higher than that of patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans. The aim of treatment in patients with TAO is to make patients abstain from smoking to prevent ulceration and to shorten the period of healing of trophic lesions without major amputation, as ulceration and gangrene in T AO are limited to the most distal part of the limbs, and seems to have healing potential.\r"

Furthermore, a critical appraisal of the bacteriological data indicated that a certain diagnosis of Meleney's gangrene cannot be provided by the clinical bacteriologist. Finally, the histological features were entirely non-specific thus precluding a definitive diagnosis by the histopathologist. If Meleney's entity cannot be diagnosed its existence becomes debatable. The alternative diagnosis of cutaneous amoebiasis is advanced for consideration. Several of the outstanding features of Meleney's progressive gangrene, hitherto unexplained, are better understood if Entamoeba histolytica is accepted as the prime cause rather than bacteria.\r"

The aspirated gastric juice was corrected for gastric outlet loss and enterogastric reflux. Gastrectomy drastically reduced the stimulated gastric secretion by a similar proportion for the two secretagogues, thereby implying that antral gastrin plays no greater part in one than in the other. Gastric outlet losses were also reduced after gastrectomy, but as a fraction of gastric contents, both gastric outlet loss and enterogastric reflux more than doubled; the possible relationship of these findings to the aetiology of gastric ulcer is discussed.\r"

The treatment options were by endoscopic methods, radiotherapy, surgery or a combination of these. Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent histological type (51 per cent) and 41 per cent of patients had squamous carcinoma. In addition to survival the quality of swallowing and the incidence of late complications following the treatment options was assessed. Primary surgery was carried out in 21 cases (operability rate 17.5 per cent) and 81 per cent of these cases were resectable. The overall operative mortality rate was 14.3 per cent (6 per cent in resected cases) and the 5-year survival rate was 9.5 per cent. After primary radiotherapy only 5 per cent of patients survived 2 years. The majority of patients were treated by endoscopic intubation with an overall mortality of 16.6 per cent and a mean survival of 5.5 months. Patients treated surgically experienced the best symptomatic relief and had the lowest incidence of late complications, when compared with those treated differently. However the overall results of surgery were poor and there remains the need to compare the results of surgery and radiotherapy in similar groups of patients.\r"

Thirteen of the twenty-seven patients complained of persistent postvagotomy diarrhoea. For each study 300 ml 15 per cent dextrose, labelled with 99mTc-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), was ingested at a standard rate by subjects who sat facing a gamma camera. Imaging proceeded for 30 min. Gastric area activity curves were corrected for emptying of the test meal during ingestion, and for movement using a new image alignment technique. Gastric emptying at 15 min was 10 +/- 2.6 per cent (mean +/- s.e.m.) in healthy volunteers, 48 +/- 7.3 per cent in patients without diarrhoea, and 84 +/- 2.3 per cent in those with diarrhoea (P less than 0.001, ANOVA). Gastric emptying from 15 min onwards was slower than normal in both patient groups (P less than 0.001). These results show that initial gastric emptying is rapid following truncal vagotomy and drainage, and this change is greater in patients with postvagotomy diarrhoea. No patient with diarrhoea had normal initial gastric emptying.\r"

Patients were grouped according to the extent of disease: group A, tumour localized to the oesophagus where severe pulmonary disease contra-indicated oesophagectomy (n = 9); group B, tumour less than or equal to 10 cm in length with mediastinal invasion (n = 81); group C, tumour greater than 10 cm in length with mediastinal invasion and/or fixed malignant lymph nodes (n = 33). Extent of disease was not recorded in one patient. The operative mortality was 4 per cent but 9 other patients died in hospital (hospital mortality, 11 per cent). Mortality was increased in patients undergoing colon bypass and in those with a large tumour load but these differences failed to reach statistical significance. The most frequent complication was neck sepsis, secondary to leakage from the proximal end of the excluded oesophagus. Eighty-nine per cent of the survivors could eat a normal, unrestricted diet on discharge and eighty-two per cent of survivors had complete and lasting relief from dysphagia. Median survival after bypass was 5 months but survival was significantly improved by radiotherapy to the tumour (P less than 0.001). Gastric bypass with radiotherapy is indicated in patients with extra-oesophageal spread of malignancy and in patients with tumours localized to the oesophagus who are unfit for resection. Bypass surgery may be contra-indicated in patients with a primary tumour greater than 10 cm in length and/or fixed lymph node metastases because mortality is increased and survival after operation is short.\r"

In 17% of cases the tumour was discovered as an incidental finding on ocular examination. The length of delay before consulting a physician was generally short in symptomatic patients, with 85% reporting that they saw a physician within 3 months of onset of the first symptom. Of the 30 patients who received definitive treatment 4 months or more after initial presentation, 13 were seen by general practitioners who delayed before referring the patient to an ophthalmologist.

Appropriate preventive measures are imperative. Fortunately, HIV is easily eradicated from the environment. Routine handwashing and cleansing of equipment are normally sufficient to prevent its spread. The fear of AIDS effectively reminds us to adhere to high standards of infection control. This has the added benefit of protecting both physician and patient from other, less lethal but more infective conditions.\r"

Patients were randomized and treated 12 times either once per week or three times per week with a Prosorba column containing 50 or 200 mg protein A. Treated plasma volumes varied from 150 ml off-line to 2000 ml on-line. Seven patients having advanced metastatic breast adenocarcinoma patients were evaluated. All had advanced progressive disease that was resistant to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Greater than 50% regression of measurable tumor volume occurred in four of seven patients; an additional patient responded with 33.5% regression. Two patients with only bony metastases demonstrated stable disease for a 60-day period. Side effects resulting from protein A treatments included transient fever, chills, rigors, and infrequently nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, episodic hyper and/or hypotension, bronchospasm, venospasm, headache, joint and tumor pain. Mild to moderate reactions were seen in all patients regardless of clinical response, but abated spontaneously or were controlled with pretreatment and/or post treatment with antipyretics and/or antihistaminics. The side effects decreased notably during the course of the week with the more intense reaction occurring during the first treatment of the week. Side effects occurred regardless of column size or volume of plasma treated. In the course of 12 treatments, anemia requiring transfusion developed in two of seven patients. Significant tumor regression was obtained in this group of patients with advanced disease. In light of the mild to moderate side effects and tumor regression in five of seven of the patients treated, protein A treatment merits further evaluation to determine the effectiveness of this treatment in breast adenocarcinoma.\r"

HeLa-BLMr and KB-BLMr were obtained after 5 and 2 months of incubation with BLM, whereas the establishment of Hepd-uvBLMr required 3 months of incubation with BLM after ultraviolet treatment. These cells have been successfully subcultured for more than 150 passages during more than 2 years in the presence of 1 microgram/ml of BLM. The degrees of BLM resistance were 20-fold, 11.6-fold, and 186-fold for HeLa-BLMr, KB-BLMr, and Hepd-uvBLMr, respectively, and the resistant phenotype of both HeLa-BLMr and Hepd-uvBLMr was stable when they were cultured for 30 passages in BLM-free medium, but unstable in KB-BLMr. Although each cell line exhibited cross-resistance to 3 to 5 other antitumor agents including peplomycin, combined use of BLM with a polyene antibiotic, a calcium channel blocker, or a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor overcame the BLM resistance in vitro to various degrees.\r"

Eighty-three patients with Stage II endometrial carcinoma were treated between January 1964 and December 1983. Sixty-nine patients (83%) received combined whole-pelvic irradiation and surgery, five (6%) had surgery alone and nine (11%) had radiotherapy alone. Five-year actuarial survival rates were 67%, 60%, and 38%, respectively. No pelvic recurrence occurred in the 69 patients who received the combined therapy, and there was no vaginal recurrence in the 80 patients treated with intracavity radium. There was a significantly lower incidence of pelvic lymph node metastases (P = 0.03) in patients treated with preoperative irradiation. The median time to recurrence was 17 months, with 67% of the recurrences diagnosed before 2 years, and 88% within 5 years. Ten patients (12%) incurred severe complications and three died as a result. Whole-pelvic irradiation, intracavity radium, and hysterectomy are effective treatment for occult pelvic and vaginal disease.\r"

The latent interval ranged from 9 months to 16 years. The median observation period is 33 months. The symptomatology, working diagnosis, treatment, and outcome are described. Surgery was hazardous because of the bilaterality of the involvement and exploration for mere verification of diagnosis was unjustified in typical cases. Treatment with corticosteroid achieved durable objective response in 25 (35%) of 72 patients. The importance of early detection and corticosteroid treatment is discussed.\r"

Capillary blood flow within intrahepatic Walker carcinosarcomas and normal liver were measured with a laser doppler needle probe. Tumor capillary blood flow increased briefly but significantly with intraportally administered epinephrine. This effect was blocked by phenoxybenzamine but not by propranolol. The response of capillary flow in normal liver to epinephrine was dose related, with decreased flow with higher doses, and slight increase with lower doses. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine produced brief increases in capillary flow in tumor and liver, and isoproterenol caused a decreased flow. In studies with injected silicone rubber (Microfil, Canton Bio-Medical Products, Boulder, CO) performed previously, and on electron microscopic examination, there was evidence of increased vascular filling within central areas of tumors after epinephrine. These studies suggest that the brief but potent effect of epinephrine on tumor capillary flow could be useful in improving delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to liver tumors.\r"

  ".U": "88164709\r", 
  ".W": "The DNA distribution pattern was determined by cytofluorometry in 25 cases of colorectal small carcinoma and the so-called severe dysplasia. The colorectal carcinoma and \"severe dysplasia\" consisted of four principal stemlines as to DNA ploidy: diploidy, aneuploidy, and their respective polyploidies. These patterns appeared in various combinations in individual neoplasms. DNA distribution of the severe dysplasia was diploid-predominant (11 cases) or aneuploid-predominant (three cases), usually showing mosaicism in various degrees with respective first order polyploidy. Similar DNA distribution patterns also were found in submucosally invasive small carcinomas. The neoplastic cell populations of a higher polyploidy (second or third order), however, occurred only in the submucosally invasive carcinomas (three cases) regardless of their basic ploidy. The mitotic index tended to be higher in the aneuploid-predominant tumors than in the diploid-predominant tumors. In the current observation, there was no significant correlation between the DNA distribution pattern and histologic type of the \"dysplasia\" or carcinoma. We found that most of the so-called severe dysplasias of the colon and rectum already gained definitive characteristic of carcinoma in the DNA pattern, i.e., ploidy heterogeneity. Therefore, they can be identified as intramucosal carcinomas, distinct from the normal epithelia and adenomas of the colon and rectum.\r"

  ".W": "The entire colonic mucosa of 51 cases of colorectal carcinoma was examined histologically. Mucosal lesions including goblet cell hyperplasia, crypt dilatation, ulceration with regeneration, basal cell hyperplasia, metaplastic lesions, and adenomas were encountered. Goblet cell hyperplasia (80.4%) was most prominent adjacent to the carcinoma (transitional mucosa). Whether this represents a precancerous change is controversial. Crypt dilatation (57%) is considered a nonspecific change due to mucosal injury and indicates obstruction to the outlet of the crypts. Ulceration (6%) is often proximal to the carcinoma and is considered secondary to stasis and ischaemia due to obstruction. Basal cell hyperplasia is particularly prominent at the site of lymphoid follicles. It is suggested that the hyperplasia is a reactive response to the presence of stimuli in the intestinal content. It is observed that metaplastic lesions have their origin from these foci of basal cell hyperplasia. The presence of basal cell hyperplasia in metaplastic polyps (14%) indicates that they are active lesions in the process of formation and growth. The occurrence of metaplastic lesions may provide an indication of an adverse environment and a vulnerable mucosa. Adenomas have their origin from basal cells of colonic crypts. They are present in 47% of colorectal carcinoma. The findings support the view that adenomas are the most common and important precursor lesion associated with colorectal carcinoma in man. No de novo foci of malignant transformation was encountered but this does not exclude the possibility of de novo carcinogenesis of the colorectum.\r"

A large range of individual tumor activity was found; no correlation was present between proliferative and metabolic activity in the same tumor, the distribution of tumors with high and low activity was similar between histologic types, and the activity was not higher in undifferentiated tumors. There was a strong association between in vitro activity of the tumor and patient outcome (both clinical status and survival). On the basis of in vitro activity, a subset of patients was identified within subgroups with known amount of residual tumor; proliferative activity was a better predictor of good outcome in patients with no residual disease, whereas metabolic activity was better in those with more extensive disease. In these patients, a tumor showing high proliferative and/or metabolic activity (greater than 5000 cpm) was associated with poor survival.\r"

  ".W": "The study documented in this article was performed to define the clinical and morphologic features of cystic hypersecretory carcinoma (CHC) and cystic hypersecretory hyperplasia (CHH) of the breast. Both lesions are characterized by the formation of cystically dilated ducts containing a homogeneous eosinophilic secretion that resembles thyroid colloid. In most cases CHC features micropapillary intraductal carcinoma, occasionally giving rise to a high-grade, invasive carcinoma that is absent from CHH. Electron microscopy of the cystic component in one case of CHC showed ultrastructural characteristics of metabolically active cells, but few secretory granules. Twenty-nine patients with CHC were observed for up to 23 years. Twenty-five women who had intraductal carcinoma were well or died of other causes. Of the four patients who had invasive carcinoma, one died 9 months after being diagnosed as having systemic metastases, and the other three remained disease-free. Ten cases of CHH were reviewed; follow-up information was available for eight patients for up to 5 years. Six women were alive and well. One woman died of contralateral invasive carcinoma, and a second was well having had a modified radical mastectomy for a separate, coexisting intraductal carcinoma in the same breast. These findings indicate that intraductal CHC has the same low-grade clinical course as other forms of intraductal carcinoma. Because invasive carcinoma arising in this setting appears to be histologically high-grade, it is important to recognize and promptly treat the lesion while still in its in situ phase. Foci with the appearance of CHH may be found in CHC, but in this study progression from CHH to CHC was not observed. A thorough histological examination is needed to distinguish between CHC and CHH. Lesions judged to be CHH are adequately treated by wide excision. Additional long-term, follow-up studies will be necessary to define the precancerous potential of CHH.\r"

Two hundred sixteen specimens (92%) produced enough material for assessment; 206 were diagnosed as cytologically malignant. In 41 patients surgical specimens from the same tumors were available. Thirty-eight of these specimens (93%) were classified according to ploidy. No significant correlation was found between aneuploidy and clinical stage (size and lymph node involvement). The comparison of DNA histograms from 21 primary breast tumors and homolateral axillary lymph nodes showed mostly similar patterns. On the contrary, eight of nine synchronous bilateral cancers were shown to have different ploidy. Flow-cytometry-derived DNA histograms of fine needle samples could be a valuable tool in the management of breast cancer.\r"

These second lesions were in the relatively early stage. Moreover, incidence of the coexistence of intraepithelial carcinoma contiguous to the main lesion was 42.1% and 100.0% in those with multiple cancers, with and without preoperative irradiation, respectively. The values were 7.6% and 53.1% in patients with a solitary carcinoma, respectively.

Similarly, a higher stage at diagnosis predicted a shorter disease-free survival. Renal vein invasion adversely affected prognosis only for high nuclear grade carcinomas. Papillary and spindled carcinomas, independent of nuclear grade, were associated with a significant decrease in disease-free survival compared to tumors with a solid pattern. Patients with large neoplasms (greater than 10 cm) had a significantly worse disease-free survival than patients with tumors 10 cm or less. The prognostic significance of tumor cell type is less clear. Patients with oncocytomas had the best disease-free survival compared with patients with tumors of other cell types. However, the difference in survival was not statistically significant for low-grade tumors, suggesting that nuclear grade rather than cell type may be the more important determinant.\r"

In the histologic sections taken from flat lesions there was hyperkeratosis, dyskeratosis, and abnormal nuclear maturation.

Both markers were present in most of the markedly atypical DN, in about half of the moderately atypical DN, and in less than 30% of the mildly atypical DN.

He also had multiple follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas with a metastatic lesion in the lumbar vertebrae. After a total thyroidectomy, he became slightly hypothyroid, and the lumbar lesion began to incorporate 131I by scintigraphy. When an iodine-containing contrast medium happened to be injected, a transient increase of serum thyroid hormone level was observed. After complete thyroid ablation with 83 mCi of 131I, the oral administration of 100 mg of potassium iodide for 7 days induced a prominent increase of serum thyroid hormone level. These findings indicated that the metastatic thyroid carcinoma could produce excess thyroid hormone insofar as a sufficient amount of iodide was given. Although this is the first report of such a case, iodide-induced thyrotoxicosis may not be rare in patients with thyroid carcinomas because the Wolff-Chaikoff effect is thought to be lost, and the organic iodinating activity and lysosomal protease activity are well-preserved.\r"

Resection of the tumor in these cases is not possible, and palliative bypass surgery is highly risky. The peroral placement of a prosthesis is less invasive, but conventional prostheses often fail to occlude the fistula. The authors regularly use an endoscopic multiple-diameter bougie for dilation. After dilation, a specially designed prosthesis is pushed through the tumor stenosis to block the fistula. This procedure can be done without general anesthesia. The funnels of conventional prostheses cannot cover the fistula when there is either a wide, proximal esophagus above the fistula or a high fistula. To cope with this particular situation, a special fistula funnel was developed. It perfectly occludes the fistulas in all patients. Of 21 patients, 19 were discharged without further aspiration.\r"

A multidisciplinary study of IPSID was undertaken by the Tunisian/French Lymphoma Study Group in 1980 to reach a better understanding of the two subgroups of the disease: secreting IPSID (essentially alpha-chain disease [ACD]); and nonsecreting IPSID (NS-IPSID) (extensive small intestinal lymphomas without gammopathy). The results of initial exploratory laparotomy performed in 38 cases of IPSID (17 ACD and 21 NS-IPSID) are described here, and show notable similarities between the two groups: the extensive pattern of the abnormal cell infiltrate along the major part of the small intestine; frequent and extensive involvement of the mesenteric lymph nodes; the existence of several degrees of severity in small intestinal mesenteric lymph nodes; and other intraabdominal organ involvement. Certain differences also were observed: the relatively high degree of tropism of the NS-IPSID towards the gastric mucosa which was absent in the ACD of this series; and the more frequent involvement of the entire length of the small bowel in ACD. In spite of these discrete differences, the IPSID form a homogeneous group which is definitely distinguishable from the segmentary small intestinal lymphomas known as Western-type, and which account for approximately one third of our non-Burkitt's small bowel lymphomas.\r"

The expected survival rate was 85% at 10 years after diagnosis. Local recurrence or dissemination was observed in 13 patients. It occurred within 5 years of diagnosis in 11 patients and was localized (that is, local recurrence or single bone metastasis) in eight patients. It was always associated with the appearance or an increase of the M component. Dissemination frequently had a \"metastatic\" pattern with no diffuse bone marrow plasmacytosis. The incidence of local recurrence (five patients) and leukemia (four patients) was high. Local recurrence and/or dissemination were significantly more frequent in patients with the M component at diagnosis than in those without it (P less than 0.05; relative risk, R = 4). The effectiveness of surgery and chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy is also discussed.\r"

Multivariate analyses of prognostic factors including treatment, tumor burden, histologic subtype, pathologic stage, number of involved regions, mediastinal size, systemic symptoms, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), sex, and age were carried out. With regard to disease-free survival tumor burden was by far the most important prognostic factor for patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy as well as for patients treated with radiotherapy alone. With regard to survival from Hodgkin's disease only tumor burden and age were independently significant. A combination of tumor burden, histologic subtype, and sex singled out patients with a high relapse rate both after radiotherapy only, and after radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. This combination also singled out patients destined to die from Hodgkin's disease more accurately than other prognostic factors.\r"

  ".W": "Intracoronary papaverine is used as a means to induce a strong and short-lasting hyperemia in several recently developed methods to measure coronary flow reserve. Changes in stenosis geometry from papaverine would influence the measured coronary flow reserve. Therefore, we investigated the influence of intracoronary papaverine on stenosis geometry with quantitative analysis of the coronary angiogram and assessed the influence of papaverine on pressure-flow characteristics of the stenosis and coronary flow reserve. The cross-sectional areas (mean +/- SD) of the stenosis increased 18% +/- 7% after papaverine. The normal proximal and distal parts of the coronary artery dilated 5% +/- 2% after papaverine. This results in a decrease of the calculated pressure drop over the stenosis varying from 20% to 30%. Coronary flow reserve of a flow-limiting epicardial stenosis is overestimated by 16% when papaverine is used to induce hyperemia. These papaverine-induced changes can nevertheless be circumvented by maximal vasodilation of the major epicardial coronary artery with 3 mg intracoronary isosorbidedinitrate prior to the investigation of the coronary flow reserve with papaverine.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of rapid preload reduction on left ventricular performance in nonischemic cardiomyopathy, 11 patients were studied during inferior vena caval (IVC) balloon occlusion. Five developed sustained pulsus alternans. During pulsus alternans, the strong beats demonstrated systolic performance characteristics similar to baseline values, despite a drop in both left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameter (66 +/- 13 to 61 +/- 13 mm; p less than 0.05) and LV end-diastolic pressure (21 +/- 8 to 9 +/- 6 mmHg; p less than 0.05). In contrast, the weak beats demonstrated a reduction in peak systolic pressure (130 +/- 36 to 109 +/- 33 mmHg; p less than 0.02), fractional shortening (20% +/- 4% to 17% +/- 9%; p less than 0.05) and peak positive dP/dt (1,006 +/- 224 to 921 +/- 287 mmHg; p less than 0.05). Measures of diastolic performance (peak negative dP/dt, the time constant of LV relaxation, the length of diastasis, and LV end-diastolic stress) were not different between baseline beats and the strong beats; and only LV end-diastolic stress differed when baseline beats were compared to the weak beats. When the strong beats were compared to the weak beats during induced pulsus alternans, significant differences were observed in peak systolic pressure, peak positive dP/dt, and fractional shortening, but no differences in any measured diastolic parameter was observed. A slight difference was noted in the left ventricular end-diastolic diameters, with the weak beat consistently beginning at a slightly smaller diameter (61 +/- 13; mm vs 59 +/- 13; p less than 0.05). In summary, these data are consistent with an augmentation and deletion of intrinsic contractile forces in association with an alternation in preload on a beat-to-beat basis as best describing left ventricular performance during pulsus alternans.\r"

The mean gradient decreased to 40 mmHG, and the aortic valve area increased to .62 cm2. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was performed 2 weeks later, and an 85% proximal left circumflex stenosis was successfully dilated to 20%. No complications were noted during either procedure. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had returned to normal activities and was asymptomatic. Thus, combined therapy with PBAV and PTCA is technically feasible in selected elderly patients with calcific aortic stenosis and anatomically suitable coronary artery disease. This nonsurgical therapeutic approach may be useful in the treatment of selected patients who refuse or who are deferred from cardiac surgery.\r"

  ".U": "88165023\r", 
  ".W": "Coronary angiography with standard ionic contrast media is associated with marked alterations in cardiac hemodynamics because of the depressant effects of the contrast media on cardiac contractility. Nonionic contrast media have been reported to produce less hemodynamic alteration than standard ionic contrast media. However, there is no information on how one nonionic media compares to another. Thus we compared the hemodynamic effects of three nonionic contrast media, Iopamidol (IOP), Iohexol (IOH), and Ioversol (IOV) to each other as well as to the standard ionic contrast media Hypaque-76 (H76). In 20 closed-chest anesthetized dogs, we recorded the maximal change in left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), mean aortic pressure, left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVDP), and left ventricular dp/dt during 10-cc left main coronary artery injections of H76, IOP, IOH, and IOV. The mean aortic pressure and LVSP decreased 36 +/- 17 mm Hg and 46 +/- 21 mm Hg with H76 but only 5 +/- 5 mm Hg and 6 +/- 5 mm Hg with IOP, 5 +/- 4 mm Hg and 6 +/- 6 mm Hg with IOH, and 5 +/- 4 mm Hg and 7 +/- 6 mm Hg with IOV (P less than 0.001). The LVDP increased 6 +/- 5.0 mm Hg with H76 but only 0.2 +/- 0.5 mm Hg with IOP, 0.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg with IOH, and 0.5 +/- 1.0 mm Hg with IOV (P less than 0.001). The LV dp/dt decreased 545 +/- 261 mm Hg/sec with H76 but increased 886 +/- 477 mm Hg/sec with IOP, 910 +/- 96 mm Hg/sec with IOH, and 473 +/- 335 mm Hg/sec with IOV (P less than 0.001). Whereas each nonionic agent produced significantly less hemodynamic abnormalities than H76, there was no significant difference between any of the nonionic agents on any hemodynamic parameter. Thus, as compared to H76, these nonionic contrast media produced only trivial alterations in hemodynamics and LV dp/dt. These agents may be preferable in patients with LV dysfunction.\r"

CT was positioned at the patient's midchest level. The pressure measurements obtained by DT compared favorably with those of CT. Femoral arterial pressures by the two methods showed no statistical difference. Right heart pressures were similar using both transducers. However, right ventricular pressures by DT in five of eight patients were lower than that from CT. Higher pulmonary arterial pressures were noted in two of seven patients and higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were seen in four patients using DT compared to CT. None of these differences were of statistical significance. These pressure differences may be due to transducer position. Because the midchest position of CT does not precisely define the anatomic location of the cardiac chamber being studied, pressure measurements can be overestimated or underestimated. DT eliminates this problem, as well as overshooting and concern with air bubbles in the catheter system commonly associated with CT. Therefore DT may provide accurate hemodynamic measurements. It would appear to be useful regardless of patient position and may be useful in ambulatory hemodynamic determinations.\r"

The children were randomly allocated to a control (C) group (n = 6) or an epidural (E) group (n = 7). In Group C, surgery was performed under general anaesthesia and postoperative pain relief was achieved by using non-narcotic analgesics only. In Group E, lumbar epidural anaesthesia was combined with light general anaesthesia and postoperative pain relief was achieved by intermittent doses of bupivacaine administered through an epidural catheter. Cortisol levels were assessed before surgery (C), at the end of surgery (H0), at the 3rd, 6th, 12th and 24th postoperative hours (H3, H6, H12, H24). In Group C, cortisol levels increased significantly at H0, H3 and H6, whereas in Group E, a significant decrease was observed at H0 and a significant increase at H12. Mean cortisol values at H0 and H24 were significantly lower in Group E, when compared with those measured in Group C. In Group E, all postoperative cortisol values remained within the normal range, despite the low level of sensory blockade achieved. This suggests that minimal doses of epidural bupivacaine are effective in decreasing the endocrine stress response to surgery in children. This could be of clinical relevance in high-risk children with poor nutritional status. In Group C, the cortisol response remained altered for a longer period of time.\r"

Two hours after induction, with assisted ventilation there was no difference in PETCO2, PTcCO2, respiratory rate, pH or PaCO2 in infants anaesthetised with either system. In the laboratory, we measured inspiratory and expiratory resistances to breathing through each system at various tidal volumes and total gas flows into the circuit. These values were compared to resistances created by breathing through an appropriately sized endotracheal tube. Although there was lower resistance to ventilation through Jackson-Rees system, both systems had lower resistances for almost all flows tested than breathing through an endotracheal tube alone (p less than 0.05). The paediatric circle absorber system is an efficient apparatus for anaesthetising spontaneously breathing infants.\r"

The time to maximum twitch depression and the time to recovery to T1/Tc 25 per cent were recorded with an integrated evoked EMG recorder. The heart rate and systolic blood pressure were recorded for five minutes after drug administration and prior to intubation. There was no difference in onset times between drugs.

Seventy-two patients divided into 12 groups (n = 6 in each) were included in the study. An initial dose of neostigmine 0.012 mg.kg-1 or edrophonium 0.2 mg.kg-1 was administered, followed at different priming intervals (1, 2 or 3 min) by either edrophonium 0.8 mg.kg-1 or neostigmine 0.048 mg.kg-1 for antagonism of atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade. Reversal was attempted at 10 per cent spontaneous recovery of twitch height. Adequate reversal of neuromuscular block (train-of-four ratio of 0.75) was achieved in all patients. Significant (p less than 0.05) acceleration of the recovery index (time taken for the twitch height to recover from 25 to 75 per cent of control) and reversal time (time taken from the end of injection of the priming dose until TOF ratio value had reached 0.75) was obtained in groups which received edrophonium-edrophonium combination. Recovery indices and reversal times were found to be significantly shorter (p less than 0.05) with a 1 min priming interval. In two additional groups of patients premedicated and anaesthetized as the others equipotent mixtures of the antagonists were administered as a single bolus dose. Reversal times were significantly longer (p less than 0.05) when compared to those given the same amounts of the combination but in divided doses with a 1 min priming interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intubation conditions were assessed at 60 seconds. A seven-minute priming interval was used in Phase I and II and a four-minute interval was used in Phase III. Priming produced significantly better intubating conditions than an equivalent single bolus; however, intubating conditions with priming did not appear to match the uniformly excellent conditions produced by succinylcholine. The data suggest that a four-minute priming interval is as effective as a seven-minute interval. The results of this study differed substantially from previous unblinded studies; therefore, it is suggested that a randomized, double-blind design with simultaneous succinylcholine controls be considered a prerequisite for future studies of intubation conditions.\r"

Edrophonium 1.0 mg.kg-1 was administered either in a single bolus dose (Group I; controls) or in an initial dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 or 0.3 mg.kg-1 followed one minute later by the remainder of the 1.0 mg.kg-1 dose in Groups II to VII respectively. Reversal was attempted at ten per cent spontaneous recovery of twitch height (T1) from atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade. Increasing the size of the priming dose from 0.05 to 0.2 mg.kg-1 resulted in a stepwise increase (p less than 0.05) in recovery of T1 and train-of-four (TOF) ratio. Higher priming doses (0.25 and 0.3 mg.kg-1) were not associated with further improvement in T1 and TOF recovery. Reversal time, that is the time taken from the first injection of edrophonium until the TOF ratio value had reached 0.75 was significantly faster (p less than 0.01) following priming with edrophonium 0.2 mg.kg-1 (Group V) when compared to Groups I, II, III, IV and VI. Reversal times were also significantly faster in Groups IV and VI when compared to the control group.

Patients were premedicated with oral or rectal pentobarbitone 2 mg.kg-1 90 minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia followed by intramuscular morphine 0.2 mg.kg-1 and atropine 0.02 mg.kg-1 60 minutes prior to induction. The SaO2 and HR of each child were monitored continuously using a Nellcor pulse oximeter during two 90 minute periods: a control period commencing 25.5 hours preoperatively (day 1) and a post premedication period commencing 1.5 hours preoperatively (day 2). Data were compared at time 0 (corresponding to the time of administration of pentobarbitone on day 2), 30 (corresponding to the administration of intramuscular morphine and atropine on day 2), 60 and 90 minutes (the latter corresponding to the time of induction on day 2) after the administration of pentobarbitone. There were no significant differences in SaO2 or HR between day 1 and day 2 at time 0, 60, and 90 minutes. The SaO2 (mean +/- SD) decreased significantly immediately following intramuscular premedication at time 30 minutes on day 2 (72.7 +/- 5.9 per cent) compared to the corresponding time on day 1 (83.9 +/- 2.9 per cent) (p less than 0.05). The duration of this desaturation was 2.5 +/- 1.9 minutes. Heart rate (mean +/- SD) increased from 109.2 +/- 21.3 beats.min-1 at time 30 minutes on day 1 to 142 +/- 20.4 beats.min-1 on day 2 (p less than 0.05). We conclude that administration of intramuscular premedication preceded by oral or rectal pentobarbitone causes transient arterial desaturation and tachycardia in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease.\r"

Affected patients classically present with two main features: limited excursion of the mandible and flexion deformity of the fingers that occurs with wrist extension (pseudocamptodactyly). Foot deformities and a shorter-than-normal stature may also be present. The underlying abnormality is short muscle tendon units, which prevent normal growth and development. We reviewed the anaesthetic experience in three paediatric patients with the trismus pseudocamptodactyly syndrome and the pertinent clinical findings in three other members of the same family, spanning three generations. Limited mandible excursion was present in all six cases, but was not obvious preoperatively in the patients because of its subtle presentation. All three cases were successfully managed using mask anaesthesia with spontaneous ventilation, avoiding muscle relaxants. Attempts to visualize the larynx under anaesthesia were unsuccessful in two cases. Blind nasotracheal intubation was successful in one patient. Postoperatively, there were no problems with the airway.\r"

  ".W": "The blood coagulation system is activated regularly in severe forms of shock, polytrauma, and sepsis. Arising thrombin cleaves the fibrinopeptides A and B from fibrinogen, and it generates monomers of fibrin, which are initially kept in solution by the remaining excess fibrinogen. The effects of soluble fibrin (fibrin monomer/oligomer-fibrinogen complexes) and fibrinopeptides A and B were investigated in blood-free perfused, isolated rabbit lungs. Urea Tris buffer-dissolved fibrin monomers were injected into the pulmonary artery in the presence of circulating excess fibrinogen. In doses above 5 mg, the monomers consistently provoked a sharp rise in pulmonary artery pressure, which was followed by an elevated pressure plateau. Changing to fresh perfusate devoid of soluble fibrin did not restore the pressure to baseline, and a second administration of the soluble fibrin caused a pressor response larger than the first. Only a modest increase in lung weight (less than 2 g) was observed, and lung inflation pressure was not altered. The pressor responses were accompanied by a rapid release of thromboxane A2 and a more delayed release of prostaglandin I2 into the perfusion fluid. A significant correlation between the height of the fibrin-induced pressure rise and the amount of thromboxane release was noted. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase (indomethacin) suppressed the generation of both prostanoids, whereas inhibition of thromboxane synthetase (OKY-046 and imidazole) selectively blocked the liberation of thromboxane. All three inhibitors caused an immediate decline in pulmonary artery pressure, which had been previously elevated due to administration of soluble fibrin, and markedly reduced the pressor response evoked by a subsequent fibrin application in the same lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "BRL34915 (BRL) is a vasodilator with a novel structure. Its mechanism of action, its effects on depolarization-induced and receptor-mediated blood vessel contraction, and its hemodynamic effects were investigated. In the rat portal vein, BRL inhibited spontaneous mechanical activity [IC50 0.013 +/- 0.001 microM (mean +/- SEM) for (-)-BRL], the initial effect being a reduced frequency of contraction. At higher concentrations, the spontaneous contractions were abolished and 86Rb+ efflux was increased. These results suggest that BRL preferentially acts on the pacemaker cells, the K+ channels in other cells being activated only at higher BRL concentrations in this vessel. In experiments on the rabbit aorta, (-)-BRL shifted the KCl concentration-response curve to the right and noncompetitively inhibited responses to angiotensin II. A concentration of 3 microM (-)-BRL reduced maximal angiotensin II contractions by around 50%, higher concentrations having little further effect. This inhibition of angiotensin II contractions is notably greater than that seen with Ca2+ antagonists in this vessel. In anesthetized rabbits, (-)-BRL was a peripheral vasodilator at doses of 3-30 micrograms/kg, but it had no relevant effects on heart rate and myocardial contractile force. This suggests tissue selectivity of this compound or this mechanism of action. BRL preferentially dilated the coronary, gastrointestinal, and cerebral vessels but not those of the kidneys or skeletal muscle as measured with tracer microspheres. This profile of activity is different from that of calcium antagonists or nonspecific vasodilators like dihydralazine. All effects were stereoselective, the (-)-enantiomer being 100 to 200 times more active than the (+)-enantiomer.\r"

  ".W": "5-, 15-, and 12-HETE (monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) are products of the lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid. We investigated their role as possible mediators of pulmonary vasoactivity and pulmonary edema. Pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa), capillary pressure (Pcap), the change in lung wet weight (delta wt) from baseline, and capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) (as a measure of vascular permeability) were determined following an intravenous injection of each mono-HETE in lungs perfused at constant flow with either a phosphate-buffered Ringer's-albumin solution (PBR) or diluted blood. Injection of 2 micrograms of each compound into the pulmonary artery of lungs perfused with either PBR or diluted blood did not produce any effect. However, in PBR-perfused lungs, 4 micrograms 15-HETE induced increases in Ppa, Pcap, and lung wet weight (p less than 0.05), which were greater than the increases observed after 4 micrograms 5-HETE. Kf increased following both 5- and 15-HETE. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor and edemagenic responses were attenuated by increasing perfusate albumin concentration from 0.5 to 1.5 g%. In contrast, 12-HETE (4 micrograms) had no effect on these parameters. In blood-perfused lungs, the pulmonary vascular responses to all HETE compounds (4 micrograms) were attenuated. In both Ringer's-albumin-perfused and blood-perfused lungs, the relative magnitude of the hemodynamic and fluid filtration responses to each mono-HETE were as follows: 15-HETE greater than 5-HETE greater than 12-HETE. In conclusion, the pulmonary vasoconstrictor and edemagenic effects of 5- and 15-HETE occur independently of blood-formed elements. 15-HETE causes greater pulmonary vasoconstriction and edema than 5-HETE. Both 5- and 15-HETE induce pulmonary edema, probably as a result of increased lung vascular permeability. The results indicate that 5- and 15-HETE are potent pulmonary inflammatory mediators.\r"

  ".W": "While the exact mechanisms that initiate atherosclerotic lesions are unknown, considerable evidence supports a role for low density lipoprotein (LDL). We investigated whether in the normal rabbit, LDL metabolism in areas of aorta that are destined to become lesioned during cholesterol feeding differed from the metabolism in adjacent lesion-resistant aorta. These studies took advantage of the predictable pattern of early atherosclerotic lesions in the cholesterol-fed rabbit. Early lesions occur diffusely in the aortic arch and ascending aorta and distal to branch orifices in the abdominal aorta and the descending thoracic aorta. Arterial rates of irreversible degradation of LDL and concentrations of intact LDL were measured in susceptible and resistant sites with homologous doubly labeled LDL. LDL was labeled directly with 131I and with 125I-tyramine cellobiose. The latter label provides a highly sensitive means to determine the sites and rates of lipoprotein degradation in vivo. The arterial concentration of intact LDL in the lesion-prone aortic arch was 3.12 +/- 0.45 micrograms LDL cholesterol/g (n = 14), 3.6 +/- 0.69 times that in the relatively lesion-resistant descending thoracic aorta (p less than 0.001). The rate of LDL degradation in the aortic arch was 3.14 +/- 0.41 micrograms LDL cholesterol/g/day, 2.14 +/- 0.24 times that in the descending thoracic aorta (p less than 0.001). In the abdominal aorta, the LDL (per gram wet weight) concentration and degradation rate (per square centimeter surface area) at branch sites exceeded that at nonbranch sites by 88 +/- 11% (p less than 0.001) and by 61 +/- 8% (p less than 0.001), respectively. These data provide evidence that in the normal rabbit, which does not develop atherosclerotic lesions, focal elevations of arterial LDL degradation rate and concentrations of intact LDL occur at sites that first develop atherosclerotic lesions in the hypercholesterolemic animal. These differences in LDL metabolism may be linked causally to the propensity to develop atherosclerotic lesions at these sites.\r"

  ".U": "88165416\r", 
  ".W": "We developed a technique to measure regional two-dimensional deformations in the myocardium. Three piezoelectric crystals were implanted in a triangular array in the left ventricular anterior midwall in six anesthetized dogs. Each crystal was used in a dual function, to both transmit and receive ultrasonic signals from the other two crystals. In this manner, the three segment lengths of the crystal triangle throughout the cardiac cycle were simultaneously recorded. The orientation of the crystal triangle with reference to the left ventricular long and minor axes was determined. The orientation and three segment lengths of the crystal triangle were used to calculate the circumferential strain E11, the longitudinal strain E22, the in-plane shear strain E12, and the mutually perpendicular principal strains E1 and E2. Also, the orientation of the first principal direction or the in-plane angle was determined, which was defined as the angle between the first principal direction (E1) and the circumferential direction (0 degree). This information fully describes the regional two-dimensional myocardial deformations. This technique was applied to measure regional myocardial deformations at three different left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP) of 2 +/- 1 (mean +/- SD), 8 +/- 1, and 17 +/- 2 mm Hg. The first principal direction at end-systole was oriented away from the circumferential direction at low LVEDP (-43 +/- 21 degrees) but became progressively closer in each animal to the circumferential direction as LVEDP increased to mid (-26 +/- 18 degrees) and high (-14 +/- 13 degrees) levels. The end-systolic ratio E11/E1 was 0.6 +/- 0.2 at low LVEDP, but increased toward unity in each animal to 0.9 +/- 0.1 at mid and high LVEDP. Thus, at low LVEDP, the greatest systolic deformation occurred in a direction different from the circumferential orientation. Therefore, circumferential strain measurements (E11) significantly underestimated the greatest systolic deformation (E1). However, as LVEDP increased, the first principal direction rotated closer toward the circumferential orientation, and circumferential strain measurements adequately estimated the greatest systolic deformation. Nevertheless, the presence of significant amounts of shortening along either the longitudinal (E22) or the second principal direction (E2) in the midwall necessitated the use of the two-dimensional method. The change in end-diastolic configuration as LVEDP increased from 1 +/- 1 to 16 +/- 1 mm Hg was also examined. Unlike the end-systolic data, the end-diastolic first principal direction did not deviate significantly from the circumferential direction at any LVEDP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we quantitated the dose-response effects of topically applied PAF on microvascular permselectivity and investigated the biochemical pathways of this compound. Permselectivity alterations were assessed by measuring the clearance of macromolecules with fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran 150 (FITC-dx 150) as a tracer. The microvascular bed of the hamster cheek pouch served as a model. PAF was found to induce leakage of macromolecules from postcapillary venules. Control FITC-dx 150 plasma clearance (+/- SEM) was 72 +/- 10 nl/90 min. Clearances of 61 +/- 10 474 +/- 145, 622 +/- 57, 301 +/- 86, and 142 +/- 3 nl/90 min were obtained at PAF concentrations of 10(-9), 10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M, respectively. A one-way analysis of variance showed that the population means were not equal. Multiple comparison by the Student-Newman-Keuls test demonstrated that the clearances obtained with 10(-8), 10(-7), and 10(-6) M were significantly greater than controls. Significant differences existed between 10(-7) M PAF and 10(-9), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M PAF. In an effort to elucidate the biochemical pathways of PAF activity, several inhibitors of the arachidonic acid cascade and receptor blockers were used. Dexamethasone and kadsurenone attenuated the clearance response to PAF in a statistically significant manner, while indomethacin, OKY-046, and chlorpheniramine were without effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acetylcholine produced concentration-dependent constrictions, causing maximal reductions of 71 +/- 3% in lumen diameter, with EC50 values averaging 1.9 X 10(-7) M (n = 7). These responses were inhibited by atropine (10(-7) M) and therefore were mediated by muscarinic receptors. In addition, acetylcholine did not elicit relaxation in nine out of 10 vessels precontracted with U46619 (10(-7) M). Norepinephrine and epinephrine never produced constrictions (n = 6) even in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M).

These relaxations were suppressed by propranolol. Between transmural pressures of 10 and 90 mm Hg, there was no intrinsic myogenic tone (n = 7). In addition, the vessels responded only passively to sudden pressure changes of 40 mm Hg.

In the human pressure-overloaded, hypertrophied left ventricle, collagen concentration is known to be increased; however, the structural and biochemical remodeling of collagen and its relation to cell necrosis and myocardial mechanics is less clear. Accordingly, this study was undertaken in a nonhuman primate model of left ventricular hypertrophy caused by gradual onset experimental hypertension. The amount of collagen, its light microscopic features, and proportions of collagen types I, III, and V were determined together with diastolic and systolic mechanics of the intact ventricle during the evolutionary, early, and late phases of established left ventricular hypertrophy (4, 35, and 88 weeks, respectively). In comparison to controls, we found 1) increased collagen at 4 weeks, as well as a greater proportion of type III, in the absence of myocyte necrosis; 2) collagen septae were thick and dense at 35 weeks, while the proportion of types I and III had converted to control; 3) necrosis was evident at 88 weeks, and the structural remodeling and proportion of collagen types I and III reflected the extent of scar formation; and 4) unlike diastolic myocardial stiffness, which was unchanged at 4, 35, or 88 weeks, the systolic stress-strain relation of the myocardium was altered in either a beneficial or detrimental manner in accordance with structural remodeling of collagen and scar formation. Thus, early in left ventricular hypertrophy, reactive fibrosis and collagen remodeling occur in the absence of necrosis while, later on, reparative fibrosis is present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Isolated buffer-perfused rat hearts with pressure-overload hypertrophy develop a greater decrease in left ventricular (LV) diastolic distensibility and a greater impairment in extent of LV relaxation in response to hypoxia than do normal hearts. Using 31P-NMR spectroscopy, we tested the hypothesis that the enhanced susceptibility of hypertrophied hearts to develop hypoxia-induced diastolic dysfunction is due to an accelerated rate of ATP and/or creatine phosphate depletion. Twelve minutes of hypoxia were imposed on isolated isovolumic (balloon-in-left-ventricle) buffer-perfused hearts from 14 rats with pressure-overload hypertrophy (LVH; LV/body wt ratio = 3.43 +/- 17) secondary to hypertension induced by uninephrectomy plus deoxycorticosterone and salt treatment and from 17 age-matched controls (LV/body wt ratio = 2.22 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.001). Coronary artery flow per gram left ventricle was matched in the LVH and control groups during baseline oxygenated conditions and held constant thereafter. Balloon volume was held constant throughout the experiment so that an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure during hypoxia represented a decrease in LV diastolic distensibility. LV systolic pressure was 165 +/- 9 mm Hg in the LVH group compared with 120 +/- 5 mm Hg in the controls during baseline aerobic perfusion (p less than 0.001). LV end-diastolic pressure rose significantly more in response to 12 minutes of hypoxia in the LVH group (12 +/- 1 to 44 +/- 10 mm Hg) than in the controls (12 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 3 mm Hg, p = 0.04). During baseline aerobic conditions, ATP content was the same in the LVH (17.1 +/- 0.5 mumol/g dry LV wt, n = 4) and control (18.8 +/- 0.6 mumol/g dry LV wt, n = 4, p = NS) groups. During hypoxia, ATP declined at the same rate in the LVH and control groups (3.2 +/- 0.5 versus 3.0 +/- 0.5%/min, p = NS) despite the greater rise in end-diastolic pressure in the LVH group. Creatine phosphate content during baseline aerobic perfusion was 14% lower in the LVH group compared with controls, but the rate of creatine phosphate depletion during 12 minutes of hypoxia was the same. During hypoxia, intracellular pH declined modestly and to the same degree in both groups. Thus, the greater susceptibility to hypoxia-induced diastolic dysfunction observed in isolated buffer-perfused hypertrophied rat hearts cannot be explained by an initially lower total ATP content or by an accelerated rate of decline of ATP or creatine phosphate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The particulate activity associated with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles has an apparent Km for cAMP of about 0.3 microM and a Vmax of 2.45 +/- 0.55 nmol/min/mg. Cyclic GMP (cGMP) inhibits hydrolysis measured at 0.25 microM cAMP with an IC50 value of 0.28 microM. In comparison, a ventricular cytosolic high-affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase activity obtained by anion exchange chromatography (Peak III) has an apparent Km of 0.93 microM and a Vmax of 17 +/- 1 nmol/min/mg. Hydrolysis of 0.25 microM cAMP by this cytosolic activity is weakly inhibited by cGMP with an IC50 value of 142 microM. Particulate enzyme activity is 60-fold more sensitive to inhibition by milrinone than is the cytosolic form (Ki = 0.18 versus 11 microM, respectively); the pyridazinone imazodan is a 12-fold more potent inhibitor of the particulate activity than of the cytosolic form (Ki = 1.5 versus 18 microM, respectively). Inhibition of both cytosolic and particulate enzyme activities appears competitive in nature. Solubilization of particulate activity did not significantly alter its affinity for substrate or sensitivity to inhibition by cGMP. In the presence of a submaximally activating concentration of forskolin (0.4 microM), selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors potentiated the activation of protein kinase in isolated ventricular septal slices. Under these conditions, changes in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity ratios correlated more closely with contractile responses than did changes in intracellular content of cAMP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The fatigue uniformly prolonged all A2H2 intervals (12.3 +/- 1.3 msec) and systematically increased the minimum H1A2 interval at which complete nodal block occurred (24.8 +/- 4.0 msec) (p less than 0.01, n = 6). To study the rate and time dependence of fatigue, nodal conduction times were obtained during three rapid 5-minute pacings corresponding to 50%, 75%, and 100% shortening of the pacing interval in the 1:1 nodal conduction range. The respective maximum fatigue-induced increases in conduction time were 5.4 +/- 1.8, 9.0 +/- 2.7, and 12.5 +/- 2.1 msec (p less than 0.01, n = 6). However, the pacing interval had no significant effect on the time required to reach either 50% (17.1 +/- 3.5 seconds) or 90% (92.6 +/- 15.4 seconds) of the fatigue observed after 5 minutes of fast rate. At the termination of any rapid stimulation, the fatigue effect dissipated with a time course that was inverse but symmetrical to that of its induction. These findings support the existence of an independent, slow, nodal memory process by which the conduction time changes according to past events with a long time constant.\r"

  ".W": "Available models of circus movement reentry in cardiac muscle and of drug action on reentrant arrhythmias are based on continuous medium theory, which depends solely on the membrane ionic conductances to alter propagation. The purpose of this study is to show that the anisotropic passive properties at a microscopic level highly determine the propagation response to modification of the sodium conductance by premature action potentials and by sodium channel-blocking drugs. In young, uniform anisotropic atrial bundles, propagation of progressively earlier premature action potentials continued as a smooth process until propagation ceased simultaneously in all directions. In older, nonuniform anisotropic bundles, however, premature action potentials produced either unidirectional longitudinal conduction block or a dissociated zigzag type of longitudinal conduction (a safer type of propagation, similar to transverse propagation). Directional differences in the velocity of premature action potentials demonstrated that anisotropic propagation was necessary for a reentrant circuit to be contained within an area of 50 mm2, even with very short refractory periods. Quinidine produced Wenckebach periodicity, which disappeared after acetylcholine shortened the action potential. Quinidine also produced use-dependent dissociated zigzag longitudinal conduction in the older, nonuniform anisotropic bundles but not in the young, uniform anisotropic bundles. The electrophysiological consequence was that propagation events differed in an age-related manner in response to the same modification of the sodium conductance. The electrical events at microscopic level showed that conditions leading to obliteration of side-to-side electrical coupling between fibers (e.g., aging and chronic hypertrophy) provide a primary mechanism for reentry to occur within very small areas (1-2 mm) due to a variety of propagation phenomena that do not occur in tissues with tight electrical coupling in all directions.\r"

Active hyperemia associated with graded treadmill exercise and coronary reactive hyperemia were examined in chronically instrumented awake dogs during control conditions, after intracoronary infusion of adenosine deaminase (5 units/kg/min for 10 minutes), and after adenosine receptor blockade with 8-phenyltheophylline. Both adenosine deaminase and 8-phenyltheophylline caused a rightward shift of the dose-response curve to intracoronary adenosine; 8-phenyltheophylline was significantly more potent than adenosine deaminase. Adenosine deaminase caused a 33 +/- 7 to 39 +/- 3% decrease in reactive hyperemia blood flow following coronary occlusions of 5-20 seconds duration, respectively, while 8-phenyltheophylline produced a 40 +/- 6 to 62 +/- 8% decrease in reactive hyperemia. Increasing myocardial oxygen consumption during treadmill exercise was associated with progressive increase of coronary blood flow. Neither adenosine deaminase nor 8-phenyltheophylline attenuated the increase in coronary blood flow or the decrease of coronary vascular resistance during exercise. Neither agent altered the relation between myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow. Thus, although both adenosine deaminase and 8-phenyltheophylline antagonized coronary vasodilation in response to exogenous adenosine and blunted coronary reactive hyperemia, neither agent impaired coronary vasodilation associated with increased myocardial oxygen requirements produced by exercise. These findings fail to support a substantial role for adenosine in mediating coronary vasodilation during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Ryanodine interferes with sarcoplasmic reticulum function in various types of muscle; in vascular smooth muscle, it can inhibit contractions that depend on sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, probably by depleting the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium store. We tested ryanodine and calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem, and nitrendipine) on small rings of rat thoracic aorta (RA) and bovine tail artery (BTA) to determine the relative contributions of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and gated calcium entry to contractions induced by norepinephrine, caffeine, and 100 mM K depolarization. Ryanodine blocked caffeine contractions in both tissues and attenuated norepinephrine responses (by 52% in RA, 14% in BTA) but minimally altered potassium contractions. Calcium channel blockers almost completely abolished potassium contractions and reduced norepinephrine contractions (by 45% in RA, 82% in BTA) but hardly affected caffeine responses. The blocking effects of ryanodine and calcium channel antagonists on the norepinephrine responses were additive. Ryanodine had no effect on baseline tension in the standard media; however, when calcium extrusion via Na-Ca exchange was inhibited by low external sodium (0-calcium, low-sodium solution), tension increased progressively after introduction of ryanodine. This indicates that the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium released by ryanodine then accumulated in the cytosol and activated contraction; restoration of external sodium caused prompt relaxation. The smaller effects of caffeine and ryanodine in BTA indicate that sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a less important role in calcium control in this tissue, with gated calcium entry dominating. These functional findings are correlated with electron-microscopic evidence that BTA has about 60% less sarcoplasmic reticulum than does RA. Ryanodine appears to be a useful tool for determining the functional relevance of sarcoplasmic reticulum for contraction in different arterial smooth muscles.\r"

Twelve patients had native coarctation and three had mild recoarctation after surgical repair. Color Doppler flow maps were analyzed with a digital analysis package and a Sony computer system. The diameter in the region of coarctation from the color Doppler flow map (mean = 2.0 +/- 0.8 mm [SD]) correlated well with the coarctation diameter measured at angiography (mean = 1.8 +/- 0.8 mm; r = .83, SEE 0.43 mm) in the 10 patients with native coarctation undergoing angiography, but the coarctation diameter measured by two-dimensional echocardiography (3.9 +/- 1.5 mm) was poorly predictive of the angiographic severity (r = .23). Additionally, spatial acceleration was seen in all patients proximal to the coarctation site, with an aliased and accelerating stream narrowing progressively as it proceeded toward the coarctation site, a pattern that is not seen in healthy subjects. Computer analysis of the color Doppler images provided pseudo three-dimensional and digital velocity maps for blue, red, and green (turbulent) flow velocities to allow an enhanced appreciation of the accelerating stream, easily separating this from normal descending aortic aliasing patterns. The narrowing of the acceleration area in the proximal descending aorta (distal/proximal acceleration zone ratio) was also predictive of the angiographic severity of coarctation (r = .83). The distribution of low-level turbulence seen proximally paralleled the distribution of the proximal accelerating stream.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) have demonstrated the efficacy of surgical and catheter-mediated ablative procedures based on activation mapping during VT. Since extensive preoperative or intraoperative mapping may be impractical due to time constraints or patient intolerance, we sought to define characteristics of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during VT that could suggest a particular endocardial region of origin and thus facilitate mapping studies. Endocardial mapping was performed during 182 VTs in 108 patients with prior myocardial infarction of either the anterior or inferior wall. Endocardial sites of origin (sites from which greater than or equal to 40 msec of presystolic electrical activity was consistently recorded) were identified with use of catheter (154 VTs) or intraoperative (85 VTs) activation mapping (both methods used in 57 Vts). Twelve-lead ECGs obtained during these VTs were characterized by four features: location of infarction, bundle branch block type configuration, quadrant of QRS axis, and precordial R wave progression pattern. A specific combination of these four features was associated with a particular endocardial region containing the mapped site of origin in 87 VTs (48% of total). An association (greater than or equal to 70% positive predictive accuracy) was more likely to be found in the presence of left, as opposed to right, bundle branch block type patterns (53/73 [73%] vs 34/109 [31%]; p less than .001) and in the presence of VT related to inferior, as opposed to anterior, infarction (40/54 [74%] vs 47/128 [37%]; p less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients had inducible sustained PRJT during control electrophysiologic study. Fourteen patients had PRJT involving a retrograde accessory pathway, and six patients had atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia (\"slow-fast\" type). ATP, which has a very short half-life, was first administered (10 mg iv over 1 sec) during sustained PRJT. If PRJT did not terminate within 2 min, a bolus of 20 mg ATP was given. Verapamil (5 mg iv over 15 sec) was subsequently administered during sustained PRJT, and if the latter did not terminate within 3 min another bolus of 5 mg verapamil was given. The cycle lengths of PRJT before administration of 10 or 20 mg ATP and 5 mg verapamil were similar. The 10 mg dose of ATP terminated PRJT in 17 of the 20 patients, and 20 mg ATP was required to terminate PRJT in the three remaining patients. The 5 mg dose of verapamil terminated PRJT in 15 patients, whereas an additional bolus of 5 mg terminated PRJT in one of the remaining five patients. The overall efficacy of ATP (20/20, 100%) was significantly greater than that of verapamil (16/20, 80%) (p less than .05); however, there was no significant difference between the conversion rate of PRJT after administration of 10 mg ATP (17/20) and 5 mg verapamil (15/20). ATP terminated PRJT more quickly than verapamil (mean 24 sec vs mean 51 sec; p less than .01). Termination of PRJT by either ATP or verapamil was mainly related to a block in the AV node in patients with accessory pathways and to a block in the antegrade slow pathway in patients with AV nodal reentry. Cycle length alternans before termination of tachycardia was observed more frequently after verapamil than after ATP (7/16 vs 1/20; p less than .01). The total incidence of transient second-degree AV nodal block and various cardiac supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias was higher after termination of PRJT by ATP than after verapamil (17/20 vs 5/16; p less than .001). A higher incidence of transient but frequently uncomfortable noncardiac side effects was observed after ATP. We conclude that ATP (10 to 20 mg) is more effective and more rapid than verapamil (5 or 5 + 5 mg) in terminating PRJT but results in a higher incidence of cardiac and noncardiac side effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A total of 20 attempts was made to ablate 14 monomorphic ventricular tachycardias in 10 patients with remote myocardial infarction with use of one to five shocks of 50 to 370 J (200 J in 70%). All seven tachycardias in which isolated mid-diastolic potentials were targeted were successfully ablated, although one required a second attempt. Twelve attempts were made to ablate seven tachycardias by delivering shocks at sites of early activation during tachycardia when mid-diastolic potentials were not identified. Only three attempts (25%) were successful. Activation preceded the QRS complex by 60, 85, and 120 msec in the three successful attempts and by 20 to 110 msec (median 55 msec) in the nine unsuccessful attempts.

However, more recent surgical pathologic data also have demonstrated a high incidence of mitral valve prolapse in cases of rheumatic heart disease, which suggests that rheumatic fever may be a cause of mitral valve prolapse. To determine whether this association of mitral valve prolapse and rheumatic heart disease is present in a stable clinic population, we studied 30 patients who had an apical systolic murmur and a well-documented history of rheumatic fever with dynamic auscultation, two-dimensional echocardiography, and pulsed Doppler examinations. Twenty of the 30 patients (67%) had findings on physical examination consistent with isolated mitral regurgitation and 25 patients (84%) had mitral regurgitation by Doppler examination. Echocardiography demonstrated mitral valve prolapse in 24 patients (80%), whereas only one of the total study group had echocardiographic findings consistent with mitral stenosis. We conclude that (1) the presence of an isolated systolic murmur in patients with a history of rheumatic fever frequently represents pure mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral valve prolapse and (2) postinflammatory changes in valvular tissue resulting from rheumatic fever may be the etiology of mitral valve prolapse in these patients.\r"

In this study we used microspectrophotometry to measure the oxygen saturations within arteries and veins of less than 100 micron diameter in quick-frozen biopsy samples from normal and regionally stunned myocardium of 10 open-chest anesthetized dogs. Regional myocardial blood flow, measured by radioactive microspheres, was similar in stunned and normal regions, as was mean arteriolar oxygen saturation. However, mean venous oxygen saturation was lower in the stunned region (epicardium 38.0% vs 43.8%, p less than .02; endocardium 36.2% vs 39.5%, p = .12), indicating increased oxygen extraction and consumption, despite a marked reduction in mean systolic segmental shortening from 14.4% to 0.5%. In addition, there was greater vein-to-vein heterogeneity of oxygen saturation in the stunned region, with an excess of veins having low saturations (statistically significant in epicardium, nonsignificant trend in endocardium). Microvascular injections studies with Microfil or drafting ink revealed filling of over 95% of arterioles and 85% of capillaries in the stunned region, similar to the findings in the normal region. Our results are consistent with an inefficient transfer of energy into myocyte contraction or an increased use of energy for noncontractile activities in stunned myocardium. In addition, the finding of increased heterogeneity of oxygen extraction suggests that the injury to stunned myocardium may not be uniform to all contractile elements, but instead may be focally and irregularly distributed.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of coronary angioplasty on coronary flow reserve (CFR), we studied 32 patients before and immediately after single-vessel coronary angioplasty and 31 patients evaluated late after angioplasty (7.5 +/- 1.2 months, mean +/- SEM). The geometry (percent area stenosis and minimal cross-sectional area) of each lesion was determined by quantitative coronary angiography (Brown/Dodge method) and the integrated optical density was measured by videodensitometry. CFR was measured with a No. 3F coronary Doppler catheter placed immediately proximal to the lesion and a maximally vasodilating dose of intracoronary papaverine. The translesional pressure gradient was obtained in all lesions before and immediately after angioplasty and in 18 of 31 vessels late after angioplasty. CFR immediately after angioplasty returned to normal levels (greater than 3.5 peak/resting velocity ratio) in 14 of 31 patients and was improved, although not normalized, in the remaining 17 patients. CFR immediately after dilation was not significantly correlated with any of the angiographic variables of arterial stenosis nor the resting pressure gradient. Moreover, the pressure gradient and absolute distal coronary pressure at peak hyperemia were not significantly different in vessels with normal and those with abnormal flow reserve immediately after dilation, suggesting that the residual stenosis did not significantly limit hyperemia. Late after angioplasty, however, a significant relationship emerged between CFR and all four indexes of residual arterial stenosis (percent area stenosis r = .70, p less than .01; minimum arterial cross-sectional area r = .70, p less than .01; integrated optical density r = .60, p less than .01; and translesional pressure gradient r = .77, p less than .01). Furthermore, in the absence of restenosis, CFR eventually normalized in all patients. These findings demonstrate that in one-half of patients there is a transient reduction in coronary flow reserve immediately after angioplasty. In the absence of restenosis, coronary flow reserve later normalizes. Consequently, measurements of coronary flow reserve immediately after angioplasty may not reflect the eventual success of the procedure in removing physiologic obstruction to coronary blood flow.\r"

The ST elevation responses in CASS patients were classified by visual interpretation of 1 mm or more, whereas the SHW patients were identified by voltage greater than 0 mV. Accordingly, prevalence of exercise-induced ST elevation was lower in CASS patients, but they had greater frequencies of prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular enlargement and dysfunction. The poor survival was similar in the subgroup with ST elevation during exercise and recovery in CASS and SHW. Although not an independent predictor when invasive variables are known, ST elevation emerges as a useful predictor when exercise testing is performed before diagnostic invasive studies.\r"

Ten animals were reperfused through a critical stenosis of the left circumflex artery (critical stenosis group) and the remaining 10 animals underwent full reperfusion without stenosis (control group). In both groups, a comparable degree of echocardiographic systolic wall thinning was present during occlusion and partial recovery of global and regional left ventricular function in the two groups. Subendocardial blood flow was decreased in the critical stenosis group relative to the control group at 5 min after reperfusion (0.52 +/- 0.16 ml/min/g in the critical stenosis group vs 1.55 +/- 0.32 ml/min/g in the control group, p less than .05) but not at 4 hr after reperfusion, when a reduced reflow response was seen in both groups. No differences in subepicardial blood flow were seen in the two groups of animals. Infarct size was slightly greater in the critical stenosis group than the control group, but this difference was not statistically significant (infarct/risk area ratio: 55.5 +/- 7.8% in the critical stenosis group vs 39.4 +/- 9.7% in the control group, p = .21). A close inverse exponential relationship was seen between infarct size/risk area ratio and subendocardial blood flow during occlusion (r = .89, p = .001). Two control animals had high levels of subendocardial collateral flow (greater than 0.2 ml/min/g); when these animals were excluded from analysis, differences in the infarct size/risk area ratio in the control and critical stenosis groups were less striking: (55.5 +/- 7.8% in the critical stenosis group vs 48.4 +/- 9.6% in the control group). Thus, the presence of a critical stenosis results in restriction of hyperemic blood flow to the subendocardium after reperfusion but does not influence infarct size or early left ventricular functional recovery.\r"

In the present study, they have been compared in the same open-chest canine preparation of occlusion and reperfusion. Ten fasting dogs were subjected to 2 hr of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 4 hr of reperfusion. Myocardial blood flow was determined by a microsphere technique 100 min after occlusion and 3 hr after reperfusion. 201Tl was injected intravenously 20 min before reperfusion. Serial biopsy samples were obtained from ischemic and normal areas. 18F-2-deoxyglucose, a tracer of exogenous glucose uptake, was injected 3 hr after reperfusion. Thirty minutes before the animals were killed, simultaneous blood samples were taken from the femoral artery and the regional coronary veins draining the reperfused and the remote areas. Dogs were killed 4 hr after reperfusion was established. Area at risk was assessed by dye injection in vivo and area of necrosis by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, with confirmation by electron microscopy. Immediately after death, endocardial and epicardial samples were taken from regions characterized as risk regions, areas of necrosis, areas of patchy necrosis, and normal areas. These samples were counted in a scintillation well counter. Four hours after reperfusion, in ischemic myocardium (TTC positive) the relative 201Tl gradient between ischemic and normal regions was 26 +/- 13%, whereas in necrotic samples, this gradient was 71 +/- 26%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To gain insight into the differences in antiarrhythmic potential of right vs left stellate ganglionectomy, 72 dogs were randomized to either unilateral stellectomy or second intercostal space thoracotomy and left circumflex coronary arteriovenous pedicle occlusion was performed, without vagotomy, a mean of 8 weeks later under anesthesia. The type and timing of ventricular ectopic beats, including both nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, were investigated. Several covariates, including postischemic electrocardiographic changes, were considered. Both right and left stellate ganglionectomy reduced the incidence of early (0 to 10 min) (p = .004 and p = .001, respectively) and total (0 to 60 min) (p = .009 and p = .008, respectively) ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation, and improved outcome (p = .0013 and p = .0012, respectively). Early sustained ventricular tachycardia was similarly reduced (p = .02) in both stellectomized groups. By contrast, neither the type nor the time distribution of the other forms of ventricular arrhythmias differed significantly among the randomized groups. The multivariate Cox's regression model showed that ST segment elevation at 3 min postocclusion, unilateral stellate ganglionectomy (either right or left), sex, and weight were significant independent predictors of the incidence of ventricular fibrillation during the occlusion period. Lower ST segment elevation and reduced incidence of sustained ventricular tachycardia in the early postischemic period might explain improved outcome in stellectomized dogs by Cox analysis. The side of intervention (either stellectomy or sham operation) did not influence survival; however, left-sided interventions were more effective than right-sided ones. These results confirm the previously reported antifibrillatory effect of left and indicate like effects of right stellate ganglionectomy in a randomized experimental study.\r"

  ".W": "Reduction of the porosity of bone cement by centrifugation significantly improves the fatigue life of the cement when smooth, waisted specimens are tested. However, bone cement in vivo has surface irregularities at the interdigitation of the cement with the trabecular bone. The effect of centrifugation on the fatigue life of Simplex P in specimens containing surface irregularities was investigated by examining both composite specimens of trabecular bone and bone cement and specimens containing a sharp, circumferential notch. For the specimens with the sharp notch, the bone cement that had been centrifuged lasted significantly longer in fatigue (47,039 +/- 40,277 cycles) than the uncentrifuged specimens (3103 +/- 1950 cycles). Eleven of 15 uncentrifuged specimens broke at the location of a void, rather than the notch. In contrast, when the porosity was reduced by centrifugation, 13 of the 15 specimens broke at the notch. For the specimens that were a composite of bone cement and trabecular bone, the centrifuged specimens had a significant increase in fatigue life compared to the uncentrifuged specimens when tested at both 7 MPA (641,056 +/- 444,131 cycles vs. 237,969 +/- 124,153 cycles) and 15 MPA (8800 +/- 4673 cycles vs. 1534 +/- 719 cycles). Reduction of porosity in bone cement by centrifugation significantly extends its fatigue life even in the presence of trabecular bone or sharp surface notches as used in total joint replacements. These data support the concept that reduction of porosity of bone cement by centrifugation may extend the duration of fixation of the components in cemented total joint arthroplasties.\r"
