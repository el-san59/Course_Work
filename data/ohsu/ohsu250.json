The authors present data from the National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey. Of the individuals who made mental health outpatient visits in 1980, 9.4% made 25 or more visits and accounted for 50% of mental health visits and expenditures. These high users were compared with low users and with high users of other health care. One-third of the mental health high users were highly disabled and had multiple medical disorders. The authors point out the heterogeneity of this population and suggest that psychiatric benefits be differentiated according to patients' needs and services offered.\r"

The authors refute the first three assumptions and suggest that different types of treatment episodes vary in their responsiveness to price. Diagnosis appears to be a poor indicator of inpatient needs; some coverage limits outpatient benefits according to type of treatment. The authors favor a combination of pricing strategies, as well as case management and clinical review for high users, which would not impede initial treatment but would limit excessive use of mental health services.\r"

These assessments strongly predicted both components of hospital tenure--rehospitalization and in-hospital days--during a 1-year follow-up. The authors point out the conceptual, heuristic, and practical clinical advantages of examining living preference rather than traditional correlates of hospital tenure.\r"

More than 300 employees received nosocomial exposure; 158 had no history of VZV infection, of whom 49 were serosusceptible (31 per cent). Only a single employee and no patients developed clinical varicella as a result of nosocomial exposure. Costs associated with VZV control during 1986 totaled $55,934: $39,658 for work furloughs, $9,800 for serologies, $4,293 for patient isolation, $155 for varicella-zoster immune globulin, and $2,028 for infection control personnel time. These costs should be considered as part of any benefit-cost analysis of varicella immunization of health care personnel.\r"

Twenty-three health jurisdictions provided information on 800 patients diagnosed as having recurrent tuberculosis during 1981 and 1982. We found that 199 (25 per cent) of the cases did not meet the criteria for recurrent disease. Of the remaining 601 recurrent cases, 20 per cent had no chemotherapy prescribed for their previous episodes of tuberculosis, 20 per cent were prescribed inadequate or inappropriate therapy, and 33 per cent were not compliant with their prescribed therapy regimens. Patients who, during their original episode of tuberculosis, received the major portion of their medical care from physicians in private practice were more compliant than those treated by other health care providers. However, those same patients were more likely to have received inappropriate therapy than patients treated by other providers. Better patient and physician education, closer monitoring, and greater use of preventive therapy and directly observed therapy are necessary to resolve these problems.\r"

LRTI was responsible for 23 illness episodes per 100 child-years among children in their first two years of life. This indicates that a cohort of 100 children might be anticipated to have 46 LRTI episodes from birth until their second birthday. The majority of episodes correlated with the presence of four viruses in the community, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus. The minimal, estimated direct cost of LRTI in the first two years of life based on 1984 cost data was equivalent to $35.14 for every child and was comprised of hospitalization cost ($19.68) and ambulatory care cost ($15.46). Hospitalization costs attributable to LRTI comprised at least 2.5 per cent of all hospitalization costs in this age group. Immunization against the four most common respiratory viruses, at a reasonable cost per child immunized, would appear to be cost beneficial.\r"

There are 532 drinking water systems (49 large and 483 small) within Fresno County plus 14,000 private wells. We determined the number of wells per system, the output per well, and the population served by each system. The task of deriving water quality estimates for each census tract was complicated by the fact that a single census tract can be served by more than one system; each system usually has more than one well; and a single well can have several episodes of testing for various contaminants. We calculated a series of weighted averages for concentrations of DBCP, arsenic, and nitrates for each census tract, using water production figures for each well as the weighting factor. Water quality data were derived from a total of 14,861 laboratory reports, although the majority did not report on all contaminants. Mean DBCP levels ranged from 0.0041 ppb to 5.7543 ppb among the census tracts. We found no correlation between DBCP levels per census tract compared to either arsenic or nitrates. We believe that we made as complete an exposure assessment as practically feasible.\r"

Participation in team sports was associated with some \"experimentation\" with smokeless products.\r"

This decline occurred only among White men with same sex partners (SSP); early syphilis among Black men with same sex partners has risen. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that changes in sexual behavior instituted by White men at risk of acquiring HTLV-III/LAV infection may have resulted in decreased incidence of early syphilis among those men.\r"

The transmission of UVB (290-310 nm) by all of the sunglass lenses was less than 2 per cent. However, in measurements performed with mannikins wearing the sunglasses, up to 14.1 per cent of the incident UVR passed through to the eyes. When the sunglasses were moved 6 mm from the forehead, the per cent reaching the eyes ranged from 3.7 to 44.8 per cent. Although sunglasses are somewhat more effective than untinted prescription eyewear in attenuating ocular exposure, the amount of attenuation is highly variable and depends mainly on their size, shape, and wearing position.\r"

Almost 70 per cent of the individuals with some use in 1980 used services during 1981 or 1982. The heaviest use of outpatient mental health and other physician services is among the persons using services in all three years. Our data are compared with three years of data reported by Kessler in an HMO (health maintenance organization) setting. The probability that a non-user becomes a user in roughly the same in the fee-for-service and HMO populations, but the probability of continuing use in the next year is much less in the HMO. This finding, that the \"HMO effect\" on mental health care is primarily on the visits per user rather than on the number of users, is consistent with other research.\r"

Findings are based on 17,600 individuals meeting inclusion criteria. The adjusted odds ratio of having one or more hospitalization for current drinkers relative to life-long abstainers in females was 0.67 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.57-0.79) and in males was 0.74 (0.57-0.96). U-shaped relationships between level of current alcohol intake and odds of hospitalization were found. While some causes of hospitalization are clearly increased among drinkers, the overall acute care hospitalization experience of moderate drinkers appears to be favorable.\r"

To increase the relevance of the experimental findings to the clinical situation, the [Ca++] and [Mg++] in vitro were the same as in the plasma of rats and humans and the stimulation parameters used in vitro and in vivo were similar to those that elicit voluntary movements of the muscles used. Both verapamil and nifedipine significantly decreased the I50 and I90 of d-tubocurarine (d-Tc), pancuronium, vecuronium, and atracurium in vitro and those of the first three MR in vivo (P less than 0.001). In vitro, the depression of the force of contraction of the diaphragm (P) caused by all the Ca-antagonist-MR combinations could be reversed only partially by washout, neostigmine, or 4-aminopyridine. In vivo, because of limitations imposed by their cardiovascular depressant effect, the muscles were exposed to lower concentrations of Ca-antagonists for shorter periods. Under these circumstances the decrease of P caused by all Ca-antagonist-MR combinations recovered spontaneously close to control levels. This study indicates that acute administration of verapamil during anesthesia may increase MR potency, but it is unlikely that spontaneous recovery or reversibility of the residual neuromuscular (NM) block at the end of anesthesia will be significantly affected. However, long-term administration of Ca-antagonists may make difficult the reversal of the residual NM block.\r"

Twenty-four pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs were instrumented both with an intraaortic catheter to measure cardiac conduction times and, through a thoracotomy, with atrial and ventricular epicardial pacing electrodes to provide premature stimulation that would allow measurement of atrial and ventricular refractoriness. Fentanyl prolonged the RR interval in both low- (100 micrograms/kg) and high-dose (400 micrograms/kg) groups by 26 and 45%, respectively, and prolonged AV node conduction time by 28 and 25%, respectively. During atrial pacing at a rate sufficient to capture the atria, AV node conduction time lengthened in the low- and high-dose groups by 27 and 25%, respectively. Fentanyl also significantly lengthened AV node effective and functional refractory periods and ventricular effective refractory periods in both groups. Pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg) administered after fentanyl shortened RR intervals in the low- and high-dose groups by 14 and 22%, respectively, and shortened AV conduction times by 18 and 20%, respectively, but did not restore all values to baseline. Pancuronium significantly shortened AV node refractory periods in the low-dose but not the high-dose group. When administered after fentanyl, succinylcholine (2 mg/kg) significantly shortened the RR interval in the low- and high-dose groups by 14 and 12%, respectively. Succinylcholine shortened AV node conduction slightly but without significance and had no effect on cardiac refractoriness. His-Purkinje conduction remained unaffected by any drug intervention. These data demonstrate that fentanyl depresses cardiac conduction; subsequent administration of pancuronium and succinylcholine partially reverses this effect.\r"

Neuromuscular block was recorded as the evoked thenar electromyographic response to train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve (2 Hz at 20-second intervals). The dose-response curves were parallel to each other in all ten age groups studied. In neonates and infants, the ED95 of vecuronium was 47 +/- 11 (SD) micrograms/kg. This was significantly lower than the ED95 of 81 +/- 12 micrograms/kg in children between 3 and 10 years of age (P less than 0.01). In patients aged 13 years or older, the ED95 was 55 +/- 12 micrograms/kg, which did not differ from the neonatal and infant values but was significantly lower than the ED95 of children between 3 and 10 years of age. The results indicate that the dose of vecuronium necessary for tracheal intubation is age-dependent. The individual ED95 values varied between 22 and 103 micrograms/kg. This suggests that an individually optimal dose of vecuronium can be administered to pediatric patients only if neuromuscular block is adequately monitored.\r"

Magnesium and ritodrine were administered by continuous intravenous infusion to mechanically ventilated rats anesthetized with halothane. The tail-clamp technique was used to establish the MAC of halothane before and then again during the infusion of either magnesium or ritodrine. Ritodrine produced no change in halothane MAC. Increasing magnesium dosages and magnesium plasma levels were associated with nonlinear reductions in halothane MAC that were unrelated to sex or pregnancy. The alveolar halothane MAC concentration in pregnant rats (0.85 +/- 0.02) was not significantly different from the halothane MAC in nonpregnant female or male rats. At the highest plasma magnesium concentrations (15.8 +/- 1.57 mg/dl) achieved in the pregnant rats, the alveolar halothane MAC was 0.36 +/- 0.13, a 61.6% reduction in MAC. The anesthetic effects of magnesium were not attributable to cardiovascular, respiratory, or neuromuscular depression. Major decreases in blood pressure occurred only in the pregnant rats with the highest magnesium concentrations.\r"

Sixty physical status ASA I and II patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups and a double-blind design was used: group I (n = 30) received bupivacaine 0.5% (pH, 5.5) 3 mg/kg, while group II (n = 30) received alkalinized bupivacaine 0.5% (pH, 7.05-7.15) 3 mg/kg. Onset and regression of sensory blockade were determined by pinprick in the C4-T2 skin dermatomes, while motor blockade was assessed using a scheme of proximal to distal muscle group paralysis. Time to onset of sensory blockade (group I, 4.0 +/- 1.2 min; group II, 3.6 +/- 0.9 min) and time to peak sensory effect (group I, 17.7 +/- 1.8 min; group II, 16.3 +/- 1.8 min) did not differ significantly between the groups. Similarly, no difference in time to onset of motor blockade (group I, 6.9 +/- 1.7 min; group II, 6.3 +/- 1.5 min) or time to peak motor effect (group I, 18.1 +/- 1.9 min; group II, 15.1 +/- 1.9 min) was observed. Regression of postoperative sensory and motor blockade was similar in both groups. It is concluded that alkalinization of bupivacaine 0.5% solutions does not confer any added clinical advantage in subclavian perivascular brachial plexus blockade when compared with commercially available bupivacaine.\r"

The proportion of children with SaO2 less than 95% and greater than or equal to 95% was not significantly different among patients with low PAR scores (less than or equal to 6) and those with high scores (7-10) in any age group. Similarly, the magnitude of SaO2 increase after oxygen supplementation did not seem to correlate with increasing wakefulness; i.e., higher PAR scores. It is concluded that children recovering from anesthesia can become hypoxemic in the recovery room. The degree of wakefulness as measured by a PAR score cannot be used to establish an end point for oxygen supplementation. Oxygen supplementation and/or SaO2 monitoring are recommended in all children recovering from anesthesia.\r"

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that scores on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS) after epidural anesthesia with bupivacaine for cesarean section would not be different than those after chloroprocaine. Furthermore, if there were any effects, it was hypothesized that they would be related to cord blood levels of the drug. Fifty-five healthy mother/infant pairs were studied. Clinical characteristics, pharmacologic data, and BNBAS scores were obtained and analyzed using statistical techniques that included t-tests, repeated measures analysis of variance, and stepwise multiple regression. The results indicate that infants in the bupivacaine group do significantly better than those in the chloroprocaine group in the orientation cluster of the BNBAS (F[1,49] = 22, P less than 0.001); this cluster reflects higher cortical functioning. Furthermore, there was improvement in the bupivacaine group in the regulation of state cluster with age, whereas there was no improvement in the chloroprocaine group (F[1,53] = 4.34, P less than 0.01). This study suggests that performance on the BNBAS after exposure to bupivacaine is better than that after exposure to chloroprocaine.\r"

PCHE activity in the baseline samples was 432 +/- 4.6 (mean +/- SEM) U/ml, the dibucaine number 82.

  ".W": "The effect of diazepam on the cardiovascular toxicity of bupivacaine was investigated in a rat model. Under chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg intraperitoneal) anesthesia, unilateral femoral venous and bilateral femoral arterial cannulae were placed for administration of drugs, for blood sampling, and for continuous qualitative monitoring of arterial blood pressure. Lead II ECG was continuously recorded and a tracheostomy performed to increase FIO2 by use of a \"T-piece.\" Four groups of 24 to 36 rats each were studied. All rats received IV bupivacaine 2 mg/kg, within 10 seconds. Group I, the control group, received only bupivacaine. Groups II and III received IV diazepam 0.2 mg/kg, or diazepam vehicle in an equivalent volume, respectively. Five minutes after this pretreatment, groups II and III received IV bupivacaine 2 mg/kg. Group IV was given diazepam, 0.2 mg/kg, 30 seconds after injection of 2 mg/kg bupivacaine. A marked respiratory and metabolic acidosis occurred in all rats but was significantly worse in groups II and III. No rat in the study became hypoxemic. Serious arrhythmias (ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia) were noted in all groups, but the incidence was significantly higher in the group of rats given diazepam pretreatment than in the other three groups. It is concluded that IV diazepam 0.2 mg/kg given 5 minutes before administration of IV bupivacaine 2 mg/kg increases the incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmias. Second, this increase is not solely due to increased acidosis, because the rats receiving the vehicle (group III) developed equivalent acidosis but did not develop increased arrhythmias.\r"

However, some anesthesiologists prefer to use a pulmonary artery catheter to monitor patients undergoing a neurosurgical procedure in the sitting position. While offering certain advantages, pulmonary artery catheters may be of limited use in the treatment of venous air embolism because the small diameter of the proximal port is poorly suited for efficient air aspiration. The authors have designed a special pulmonary artery catheter introducer sheath which can be positioned by intravascular electrocardiography to provide an efficient and effective means of air aspiration, while permitting the simultaneous use of a pulmonary artery catheter for pressure monitoring. The flow characteristics of this sheath, with and without side holes, were tested in vitro by measuring the time required to aspirate 50 ml of blood. The introducer sheath was compared to a Sorenson CVP catheter, a Bunegin-Albin Air Aspiration CVP Catheter, and the proximal port of a pulmonary artery catheter. The rank order of flow rate was: Bunegin-Albin CVP greater than introducer sheath without side holes = introducer sheath with side holes greater than Sorenson CVP greater than pulmonary artery catheter (P = 0.0001). The introducer sheath was then compared to a pulmonary artery catheter for the treatment of a 4 ml/kg venous air embolism in sitting, anesthetized dogs. The mean proportion of air retrieved by the sheath with or without side holes, 57% and 80%, respectively, was significantly greater than that retrieved by simultaneous aspiration of atrial and distal ports of the pulmonary artery catheter, 16% (P = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The fractional inspired oxygen concentration was varied from 0.03-1.0 in five anesthetized dogs. One hundred and twelve simultaneous pulse oximeter oxygen saturation measurements (SpO2) and IL 282 CO-Oximeter arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) measurements were made. Variance of SpO2 was increased for SaO2 less than 22%. Linear regression analysis of the data for SaO2 greater than 22% produced the equation y = 0.93x + 9.8 (r2 = 0.97). The mean difference between SpO2 and SaO2 was +5.5% +/- 4.2% (SD) over the range of 22-100%. Spectral analyses of oxygenated (O2Hb) and reduced (RHb) canine and human hemoglobins were performed. The absorption spectra of canine O2Hb and RHb were nearly identical to those of human O2Hb and RHb. Therefore, 1) SpO2 measurements in dogs at SaO2 greater than 22% are relatively accurate, and 2) hemoglobin absorption characteristics support the contention that such canine pulse oximeter studies can be extrapolated to humans.\r"

This study examines the in vitro propensity for coagulation when red blood cells (RBC) are diluted with RL. Seven mixtures with different ratios of RBC to RL were prepared from each of 23 units of RBC. These mixtures were analyzed for ionized calcium, total calcium, and pH, and were checked for any indication of coagulation. Nineteen additional RBC units were split into two parts which were mixed with equal volumes of normal saline (NS) or RL. These mixtures were filtered (40 micron) and the weight gain of the paired filters compared. From these studies, the authors identified a threshold value for ionized calcium (0.23 mM/L) below which the probability of clot formation is less than 0.01. This concentration is not reached if the RBC to RL volume ratio is 2:1 or greater. As much as 100 ml of RL can be added to a unit of RBC without exceeding the threshold value. Although not advocating the routine use of RL as a diluent for RBC, the authors conclude that, within the guidelines described, calcium containing salt solutions may be used to dilute blood products.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of resuscitation with crystalloid and colloid solutions in the presence of increased pulmonary capillary permeability were studied. Twenty-four hours after oleic acid administration, dogs were anesthetized and bled to produce hemorrhagic shock. One hour later, resuscitation was performed with saline, 5% albumin, or 6% hydroxyethyl starch solution to restore and then maintain cardiac output at pre-oleic acid values for 6 h. Dogs were recovered and, 24 h later, were reanesthetized for final measurements. Oleic acid administration resulted in increases in pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and extravascular lung water (EVLW). Resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock restored pulmonary hemodynamics to pre-hemorrhage levels and did not affect EVLW, PaO2, shunt fraction, dead-space-to-tidal-volume ratio, or pulmonary compliance. There were no differences in these parameters related to the choice of resuscitation fluid. Saline resuscitation markedly reduced plasma oncotic pressure and the plasma oncotic-pulmonary artery occlusion pressure gradient. Values for these two variables were markedly lower with saline than with colloid resuscitation. The authors conclude that the pulmonary effects of crystalloid and colloid solutions are similar in the presence of moderate increases in pulmonary capillary permeability.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effects of volatile anesthetics on coronary blood flow (CBF) autoregulation and coronary vascular reserve, studies were performed on chronically instrumented dogs, awake and during the administration of 1.0 MAC halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane. Coronary pressure-flow plots were generated by measuring left anterior descending coronary artery blood flow while varying coronary inflow pressure with a hydraulic occluder. Autoregulation was quantitated by two measures: the slope of the horizontal \"autoregulated\" portion of the pressure-flow relationship and the autoregulation index (ArI) of Norris. Slope values (ml.min-1.mmHg-1 +/- SD) were: awake, 0.243 +/- 0.043; halothane, 0.414 +/- 0.044; enflurane, 0.587 +/- 0.187; and isoflurane, 0.795 +/- 0.246. The increase in slope was statistically significant only for halothane and isoflurane (P less than .05). The ArI approaches 1.0 when autoregulation is perfect, and approaches zero or is a negative number when autoregulation is absent. The authors found ArI values of: awake, 0.55; halothane, -0.08; enflurane, -0.01; isoflurane, -0.02. These values indicate good autoregulation while awake, but impaired autoregulation with all three anesthetics (P less than .05). Coronary vascular reserve was calculated, at a diastolic coronary pressure of 40 mmHg, as the difference between resting flow and flow during maximal coronary vasodilation induced by intracoronary adenosine. Coronary vascular reserve, maximal coronary conductance, and coronary zero-flow pressure were not significantly altered by these anesthetics. The authors conclude that 1.0 MAC enflurane, halothane, and isoflurane mildly disrupt CBF autoregulation, increasing CBF out of proportion to myocardial demands. Under the conditions of this study, these anesthetics do not affect maximal CBF or coronary vascular reserve.\r"

It was the purpose of the present study to investigate whether or not a greater sensitivity to cardiac alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor stimulation or an impaired adenosine- or m-cholinoceptor-mediated inhibition of beta-adrenergic stimulation contributes to the cardiac symptoms of malignant hyperthermia. The effects of phenylephrine, isoproterenol, adenosine, [-]-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA), and carbachol on force of contraction were studied in electrically driven trabeculae isolated from the left ventricles of malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) and healthy control pigs. The positive inotropic effects of phenylephrine and of isoproterenol were similar in MHS and control pigs. The EC50 values for the inotropic effect of phenylephrine were 4.1 (2.1-8.3) mumol.l-1 (n = 9) in MHS and 6.3 (3.4-12.9) mumol.l-1 (n = 9) in control swine. The maximal positive inotropic effects at 30 mumol.l-1 phenylephrine also did not differ in both groups (176.7 +/- 14.4% of pre-phenylephrine value in MHS swine, n = 9; 170.3 +/- 15.9% of pre-phenylephrine value in control swine, n = 9). The EC50 values for isoproterenol were 0.16 (0.06-0.39) mumol.l-1 (n = 9) and 0.19 (0.05-0.29) mumol.l-1 (n = 9) in MHS and control swine, respectively. The maximal positive inotropic effects at 1 mumol.l-1 isoproterenol were also similar (213.8 +/- 12.6% of the pre-isoproterenol value in MHS swine, n = 9; 216.4 +/- 36.0% of the pre-isoproterenol value in control swine, n = 9). Also, no difference could be detected in the antiadrenergic effects of adenosine, PIA, or carbachol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The authors present a simple and clinically applicable method for the serial monitoring of pulmonary microvascular enzyme function in vivo. This method requires the intravenous injection of trace amounts of a radiolabelled substrate and the collection of a single arterial blood sample. Simultaneous measurement of pulmonary blood flow, (e.g., by dye- or thermo-dilution) and the determination of blood hematocrit are also needed for the calculations. This method was compared to the multiple blood sample indicator dilution method in normal anesthesized rabbits. Both methods gave identical results for the metabolism of the synthetic, hemodynamically inactive tripeptide, 3H-benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro (3H-BPAP), by pulmonary microvascular endothelial angiotensin converting enzyme. The parameters measured were: 1) substrate utilization, expressed linearly and logarithmically, and 2) the apparent first order reaction constant. The new method was also used for the simultaneous measurement of single pass, transpulmonary metabolism of 3H-BPAP by angiotensin converting enzyme and of 5'-adenosine monophosphate by 5'-nucleotidase in rabbits in vivo. The authors propose that similar enzyme kinetic measurements could be used in clinical studies to test their usefulness as an aid in the early diagnosis of incipient pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, e.g., adult respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen cases of sudden cardiac arrest in healthy patients who received spinal anesthesia were discovered in a preliminary review of 900 closed insurance claims for major anesthetic mishaps. All patients were resuscitated from the intraoperative cardiac arrest, but six suffered such severe neurologic injury that they died in hospital. Of the eight survivors, only one exhibited sufficient neurologic recovery to allow independence in daily self-care. In view of the unexpected nature of the cardiac arrests, as well as the ultimate severity of injury, these cases were analyzed in detail to determine whether there were recurring patterns of management that may have contributed to the occurrence or outcome of these anesthetic mishaps. Two patterns were identified. The first was the intraoperative use of sufficient sedation to produce a comfortable-appearing, sleep-like state in which there was no spontaneous verbalization. Cyanosis frequently heralded the onset of cardiac arrest in patients exhibiting this degree of sedation, suggesting that unappreciated respiratory insufficiency may have played an important role. The second pattern appeared to be an inadequate appreciation of the interaction between sympathetic blockade during high spinal anesthesia and the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Prompt augmentation of central venous filing through the use of a potent alpha-agonist and positional change might have improved organ perfusion, shortened the duration of cardiac arrest, and lessened the degree of neurologic damage.\r"

  ".W": "Using the chronic maternal-fetal sheep preparation, nine pregnant ewes were studied to determine the effects of intravenous dantrolene sodium on maternal and fetal physiology, with particular reference to its placental passage, and its effects on uterine blood flow and uterine tone. Two doses of dantrolene sodium were studied: 1.2 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg. After 2.4 mg/kg, maternal cardiac output increased 29% (P less than 0.05) after 1 min and returned to normal after 30 min. Maternal mean arterial pressure increased 13% after 1 min and remained significantly elevated (P less than 0.01) for 3 h. No significant changes (P greater than 0.05) were observed in maternal heart rate, uterine artery blood flow, or central venous pressure. Maternal arterial pH declined from 7.42 to 7.39 (P less than 0.01) after 1 min and returned to baseline values after 10 min. Fetal heart rate decreased 24% (P less than 0.01) after 3 min and returned to normal after 10 min; the mean fetal arterial pressure remained unchanged (P greater than 0.05). Fetal arterial pH declined from 7.29 to 7.27 (P less than 0.05) after 1 min and remained significantly decreased for 120 min. Similar changes of lesser magnitude and shorter duration were seen following the 1.2 mg/kg dose. Maternal levels of dantrolene were less than 3 micrograms/ml. Although an equilibrium between maternal and fetal plasma dantrolene concentrations was apparent at 5 min, the fetal levels of dantrolene were approximately 10% of the mother's. The results indicate that the administration of intravenous dantrolene at 1.2 mg/kg or 2.4 mg/kg has no clinically significant adverse effect on mother or fetus in the sheep model.\r"

  ".W": "The cerebral protective effects of lidocaine were evaluated using a rat model of severe (near-complete) global ischemia produced by 10 min of bilateral carotid artery occlusion combined with systemic hypotension (MAP 45-55 mmHg). Prior to the induction of ischemia, 16 rats were given incremental doses of lidocaine intravenously until EEG slowing with sharp wave activity became evident. An equal number of rats (controls) received saline prior to the ischemic insult. Normoxia, normocapnia, and normothermia were maintained at all times. Following ischemia, the animals were allowed to recover. At 1.5 h post-ischemia, eight rats from each treatment group were reanesthetized, and regional brain water content was assessed gravimetrically. Brain specific gravity was significantly reduced from normal values in both treatment groups, and was unaltered by pre-ischemic lidocaine administration. Seven days post-ischemia, the remaining animals were reanesthetized; the brains were formalin fixed and processed for identification of irreversibly injured neurons in the hippocampus, neocortex, and caudate nucleus. Saline-treated rats displayed 75 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD) dead cells in the hippocampus (CA1); lidocaine-treated rats had similar injury (78 +/- 7%). In the neocortex and caudate nucleus, injury was graded as moderate, and no difference in severity could be distinguished between the treatment groups. The authors conclude that pre-ischemic treatment with maximal sub-epileptogenic doses of lidocaine had no effect on either early post-ischemic cerebral edema or delayed neuronal necrosis in this rat model of near-complete global ischemia.\r"

When lidocaine was administered alone, the low plasma levels (approximately 2 micrograms/ml) caused only a modest reduction in left ventricular dP/dt. The higher plasma lidocaine levels (approximately 6 micrograms/ml) reduced both left ventricular dP/dt and cardiac index, and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Diltiazem or verapamil, when administered alone at plasma concentrations of approximately 150-200 ng/ml, prolonged atrioventricular conduction, decreased heart rate and cardiac index, and, in the case of verapamil, also decreased left ventricular dP/dt and mean arterial pressure. When lidocaine was added to diltiazem or verapamil, the low plasma levels of lidocaine depressed cardiac function in the presence of either calcium channel blocking drug. In the presence of these levels of verapamil or diltiazem, only one of six verapamil-treated animals and three of six diltiazem-treated animals were able to maintain a mean arterial pressure greater than 50 mmHg with the higher dose of lidocaine. Caution may be advised if the addition of lidocaine, by whatever route, is indicated in subjects who have recently received intravenous verapamil or diltiazem.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the effects of different iso-osmolal solutions used for intravascular volume replacement on post-ischemic cerebral edema. Fasted Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 10 min of severe (near-complete) forebrain ischemia (bilateral carotid artery occlusion and hemorrhagic hypotension). At the completion of ischemia, 40% of the estimated total blood volume was replaced by iso-osmolal saline, 6% hetastarch, or blood. Plasma osmolality remained similar between groups throughout the experiment, while saline infusion resulted in a significant but transient decrease in colloid oncotic pressure. At 1.5 h, 6 h, and 24 h post-ischemia (PI), specific gravity was determined for tissue samples taken from the hippocampus, caudoputamen, and neocortex. Normal values were obtained from rats receiving anesthesia only. The ischemic insult resulted in a significant increase in regional water content at 1.5 h PI in animals receiving blood. These values were not different from rats receiving saline or hetastarch. At 6 h PI, partial resolution of the edema was observed, with no differences in regional specific gravity occurring between fluid groups. At 24 h PI, again, no difference between fluid regimens was seen in the hippocampus or neocortex. However, in the caudoputamen, hetastarch produced a significant increase in water content relative to both saline and blood. With that exception, the authors' results indicate that early post-ischemic cerebral edema remains generally independent of iso-osmolal fluids used for resuscitation in this model of global ischemia.\r"

Patients were 34 to 90 years old and half had been smokers. We found that most young patients who died clearly had asthma and died suddenly during severe attacks. Patients aged 55 and over frequently had bronchitis, emphysema, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease rather than uncomplicated asthma, and were treated less aggressively than young patients. Their cause of death was often due to multisystem disease rather than reversible airflow obstruction. Reported statistics probably overestimate the true asthma mortality rate in the older population in Oregon.\r"

Reactivity to grass appeared to amplify the risk of reaction to trees. This effect was particularly striking in the non-Caucasian groups. In groups that did not react to grasses, there was no difference between races in reactivity to trees. The non-Caucasian races did not demonstrate significant differences in their reaction to grasses. All three non-Caucasian groups appear to be more sensitive than the matched Caucasians to cedar, cypress, and juniper.\r"

Immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis was only considered justifiable when the nasal provocation test was positive. The nasal provocation test was repeated at the end of the normal course of injections recommended by the manufacturer. If the nasal provocation test was still positive, further injections were given until the test became negative. This method of improving diagnostic accuracy and monitoring results of immunotherapy was used with both aqueous extracts which were used for skin testing (Australian Government Commonwealth Serum Laboratories) and with Allpyral pyridine-extracted alum-precipitated extracts (Dome Laboratories, England). The number of injections of allergen required to convert a positive nasal provocation test to negative varied from 26 to 69 for mite aqueous injections with only 12 to 19 for mite suspension and 47 to 98 for grass aqueous injections compared with 12 to 36 for grass suspension. Direct provocation tests of the nose should give a more accurate diagnosis than RAST or skin tests and are required for monitoring therapy because considerable individual variations in sensitivity and response to treatment were demonstrated. Standard dosage schedules are not suitable for individual patients, who should have their immunotherapy personalized.\r"

The results of our survey indicate that there are 18 current and 11 planned fellowships. The fellowships primarily last one year, are research oriented, and place a large emphasis on toxicology, emergency medical services, and critical care. They are based mostly in university or university-affiliated hospitals, and will graduate physicians who stay in academic emergency medicine.

Reimbursement rates were inversely associated with age and length of stay. The elderly make up a significant proportion of trauma victims and the cost of their care is higher than for younger patients. Because reimbursement for this age group is based largely on diagnosis-related groups, which pay only fixed costs, trauma centers must analyze the potential economic impact of older trauma victims.\r"

This limits data interpretation as anesthetic agents, particularly pentobarbital, have well-documented effects on hemodynamics and the response to hemorrhage. We studied the effects of moderate ethanol intoxication on blood pressure and survival time during fatal hemorrhagic shock in unanesthetized swine. Immature female swine weighing 15 to 20 kg were splenectomized and instrumented with chronic indwelling aortic catheters, right atrial catheters, and gastrostomy tubes. Four to seven days later the unanesthetized animals underwent hemorrhagic shock. Thirty minutes prior to the start of hemorrhage, the experimental group (n = 8) received 3 mL/kg of 100% ethanol mixed as a 1:3 solution with water through a gastrostomy tube. The control group (n = 8) received an equal amount of water. The distal aortic catheter was connected to a roller pump and blood was removed at a rate of 1 mL/kg/min until the animal died. Arterial pressure, heart rate, lactate ethanol and glucose levels, hematocrit, and arterial blood gases were measured in both groups at baseline and every 15 minutes thereafter. A mean ethanol level of 1,500 to 1,700 micrograms/mL was produced in the experimental group from baseline through 60 minutes. Data were analyzed using Student's two-tailed t test, and analysis of variance for repeated measures. There was no significant difference in survival time between the control (63.1 +/- 2.8 min) and ethanol (59.9 +/- 5.9 min) groups. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the ethanol group after 15 minutes of hemorrhage (81 +/- 22 to 59 +/- 14 mm Hg, P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighty-three pairs of radiographs, taken with and without weights, of patients with suspected AC injury were studied. The films were read in a randomized and blinded manner by a staff radiologist. Criteria for classifying AC injuries were: grade 1, less than 3 mm (or less than 50%) difference between the AC widths with a normal coracoclavicular (CC) distance; grade 2, greater than or equal to 3 mm (or greater than or equal to 50%) difference between the AC widths with a normal CC distance; and grade 3, greater than or equal to 5 mm (or greater than or equal to 50%) difference in CC distance. In only three cases (4%) did weights cause the injured CC distance to increase and thereby unmask a grade 3 injury not evident on plain films. Further evidence that weights may not reliably elucidate the degree of AC joint injury is suggested by the fact that in several cases the weights actually caused the injured and uninjured CC distance to decrease. We conclude that the use of weighted radiographs lacks efficacy in unmasking grade 3 AC sprains on radiograph and we recommend that routine use of this technique be abandoned.\r"

  ".W": "Axial (in-line) traction is recommended as a stabilizing maneuver during orotracheal intubation of a trauma victim with a potential cervical spine injury. There are no published data demonstrating the safety of this technique in trauma patients with an unstable cervical spine. In our study, 17 victims of blunt traumatic arrest had radiographic analysis of the cervical spine during orotracheal intubation, with and without axial traction. Four (24%) had unstable injuries, which included a C6-7 fracture dislocation, a Hangman's fracture, and two atlanto-occipital dislocations. Axial traction during oral intubation in these victims resulted in a mean distraction at the fracture site of 7.75 mm. Axial traction produced 4 mm of posterior subluxation in the C6-7 fracture dislocation, demonstrating that axial traction alone may result in subluxation, as well as distraction. This depends on the direction of the traction force and integrity of surrounding tissues. We recommend that trauma patients requiring intubation prior to a complete examination and radiographic analysis of the cervical spine be nasotracheally intubated without axial traction, and that the head and neck be stabilized in the neutral position. If a contraindication to nasotracheal intubation exists, a cricothyroidotomy should be performed.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) resulting from recreational off-road vehicle (ORV) accidents seen during a three-year period at a spinal cord injury center were analyzed using structured interviews and record reviews. Seven accidents involved three-wheel all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), one involved a four-wheel ATV, and four involved two-wheel trailbikes. The analysis of accident victim characteristics showed that all age groups are at risk, and that most victims were young adult men vehicle drivers with experience and wearing helmets. Spinal injury levels were cervical, three; thoracic, three; and thoracolumbar, six. Categorized accident hazard patterns were loss of control, six; tipover, four; and hidden obstacle, two. Contributing causative factors to the accident occurrence were poor driver judgment, seven, and vehicle instability, eight. Speeding was the most frequent primary cause of ORV accidents. We discuss vehicle and driver performance characteristics as they relate to risk of accident occurrence. The frequency of ORV accidents as an etiology of traumatic SCI at our center was 8%, compared to 8% for diving accidents and 11% for motorcycle accidents. We recommend, in view of the high risk of severe injury, widespread public education about ORV accident prevention.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of multiple-dose activated charcoal administration on the absorption of orally administered salicylate were evaluated in a simulated overdose model. Thirteen adult volunteers were each given 24 81-mg aspirin tablets during a control phase, and during three randomized treatment periods the volunteers received 50 g activated charcoal for one, two, or three doses (separated by four hours). The control phase and treatment periods were separated by a one-week interval. Urine was collected for 48 hours to determine percent total salicylate excretion. Ten subjects completed all four phases of the study. Mean +/- SD percent recovery of salicylate from urine was: control, 91.0 +/- 6.12; one-dose charcoal, 68.3 +/- 12.46; two-dose charcoal, 65.9 +/- 13.48; and three-dose charcoal, 49.2 +/- 12.48. Each charcoal treatment significantly lowered the absorption of aspirin as compared with the control (P less than .01). There was no significant difference between one-dose and two-dose charcoal regimens. There was a statistically significant decrease in salicylate absorption with the three-dose charcoal regimen as compared to one-dose and two-dose regimens (P less than .01). We conclude that activated charcoal is effective in inhibiting absorption of orally administered salicylate, in a small-dose aspirin ingestion model, with a three-dose multiple charcoal regimen being superior to either single-dose or two-dose regimens.\r"

We then conducted a prospective cross-over cadaver study comparing the ability of medical students to perform this technique with that of the standard saphenous vein cutdown at the ankle. All students had a previous course in anatomy but had never performed a cutdown. Before testing, the students were given written material and a ten-minute lecture describing both approaches. Seventeen students performed 34 cutdowns; nine students attempted the cephalic cutdown followed by the saphenous cutdown; the remaining eight used the reverse order. The mean time (+/- SD) to isolation of the cephalic vein was 85 +/- 70 seconds; for the saphenous vein, mean time was 70 +/- 89 seconds (P = NS). There was one failure (inability to isolate the vein within five minutes) in 17 attempts at the cephalic vein and two failures in 17 attempts at the saphenous (P = NS). There were no complications (nerve, artery, or tendon injury) with either technique. The mean external vein diameter (+/- SD) of the cephalic vein and the saphenous vein were 3.2 +/- 1.0 mm and 3.6 +/- 0.7 mm, respectively (P = NS). We conclude that relatively inexperienced providers can learn to perform the cephalic vein cutdown at the wrist on fresh cadavers with similar speed and success as that for the saphenous vein cutdown at the ankle. Cutdown at this site may provide a useful alternative to the saphenous cutdown in certain clinical situations.\r"

To study this problem, we conducted a retrospective review of 200 consecutive admissions to the University of Michigan Medical Center Emergency Department from 1980 to 1985 for treatment of acute facial fractures. All patients were admitted within 48 hours of injury (93% within 24 hours). Medical records were reviewed for age, sex, description, and circumstances of facial injury; assessment of loss of consciousness and anterograde amnesia; and associated intracranial or extracranial injuries. Seventy-three percent of the patients were men (mean age, 27.8 years). Etiologies, in descending order, were road traffic accidents (52%), assaults (22%), sports (14%), falls (7%), other injuries (3%), and gunshot wounds (2%). The incidence rate of CHI in our study was 55%. More than 90% of the head injuries were associated with the loss of consciousness of less than one hour. Risk factor analysis failed to demonstrate that an increased risk of CHI is associated with age, sex, or number of facial fractures. However, there was a one and one-halffold increased risk associated with patients involved in automobile accidents.\r"

Continuing acceptance of this procedure by physicians and possibly by prehospital personnel may lead to inadvertent placement through the immature growth plate. In our study, we intentionally penetrated the epiphyseal plate with the intraosseous needle and infused fluids in order to observe what complications, if any, might arise from this procedure. Twenty pigs 3 to 4 weeks old had a bone marrow aspiration needle introduced into the medullary cavity through the tibial epiphysis under fluoroscopic visualization. Sodium bicarbonate at 2 mEq/kg (n = 10) or 0.9 normal saline at 2 mL/kg (n = 10) was infused through the intraosseous needle. Radiographs of the involved growth plates were taken at two months and six months after infusion. No growth disturbances or growth plate abnormalities were detected clinically or radiographically through the rapid growth phase of the porcine tibia. Therefore, we believe that intraosseous infusion is a safe method of alternative vascular access associated with no significant growth defects despite injury to the developing growth plate from placement and infusion.\r"

The demographics of the illiterate population suggest that they represent a significant proportion of patients cared for in a teaching hospital emergency department. This study was designed to assess whether readability of written material given to patients in a university hospital ED matched the literacy level of these patients. Data were gathered from 111 consecutive adult ED patients. Results of the survey showed that although the median education level of ED patients was 10th grade, more than 40% could not be expected to read at the 8th grade level, and at least 20% could be considered functionally illiterate. Readability of ED patient-directed materials was measured using the Fry index. Hospital and commercially generated patients education materials ranged from 8th to 13th grade level; a patient-directed brochure from Virginia ACEP is written at a college reading level. Comprehension of the \"leaving against medical advice\" (AMA) form or a consent for surgery would require at least an 11th grade education. This study shows that there is an alarming discrepancy between ED patient literacy levels in our sample and the reading skills required to comprehend important written medical and legal information. More than 50% of ED patients in a teaching hospital may read below the level required to understand standard discharge instructions. In addition, understanding the \"operative consent\" and leaving AMA forms requires a level of education beyond that of the majority of ED patients. If patient-directed written material is to serve its purpose, then ED patient populations should be surveyed and the reading level of written material adjusted accordingly.\r"

During a four-month period, 99 patients entered and 90 patients finished the study. In all cases, an individual was identified as willing to accept the responsibility of observing the patient. The observer received written and verbal instructions to stay with the patient for 24 hours and to wake the patient every four hours during that time. Patients then were contacted seven to nine days after their injury and questioned as to their present symptoms and observer compliance. For patients under 15 years of age (n = 34), the observer was questioned. Thirteen percent of the observers did not remain with the patient for 24 hours, 16% passed the responsibility of observation to another individual, and 71% awoke the patient as instructed. Observers who were not the patient's mother were significantly more likely to abandon the patient during the first 24-hour period. Observer compliance for patient awakening significantly decreased with the increase in patient age. When spouses and live-in friends were combined as a group of observers and compared with parents, the parents awoke the patient significantly more often. The authors conclude that in this population, at-home observation of head trauma patients, particularly those more than 25 years old, may not be reliable. Special attention should be directed toward the care of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "A unique data set of 3,380 British coal miners has been reanalyzed with major focus on nonpneumoconiotic respiratory conditions. The aim was to assess the independent contribution of smoking and exposure to respirable dust to clinically significant measures of respiratory dysfunction. Exposure to coal-mine dust was monitored over a 10-yr period. Medical surveys provided estimates of prior dust exposure and recorded respiratory symptoms. Each man's FEV1 was compared with the level predicted for his age and height by an internally derived prediction equation for FEV1. Four respiratory indices were considered at the end of the 10-yr period: FEV1 less than 80%, chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchitis with FEV1 less than 80%, and FEV1 less than 65%. Results were uniformly incorporated into logistic regression equations for each condition. The equations include coefficients for age, dust, and when indicated, an interaction term for age and dust. Dust-related increases in prevalence of each of the 4 conditions were statistically significant and were similar for smokers and nonsmokers at the mean age (47 yr). There was no evidence that smoking potentiates the effect of exposure to dust. Estimates of prevalences at the mean age of all 4 measures of respiratory dysfunction were greater in smokers. At intermediate and high dust exposure the prevalence of the 4 conditions in nonsmokers approached the prevalence in smokers at hypothetically zero dust exposure. Both smoking and dust exposure can cause clinically important respiratory dysfunction and their separate contributions to obstructive airway disease in coal miners appear to be additive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the hypothesis that most idiopathic prolonged apneic spells in preterm infants originate as a form of upper airway protective reflex. We elicited a previously described upper airway reflex in 10 sleeping preterm infants with apnea of prematurity by instilling physiologic saline into the oropharynx and recording respiration, heart rate, and swallowing. Immediately after a small pharyngeal bolus of warm saline, one or more of several characteristic airway reflex responses occurred with most stimulus trials. These responses included brief central apnea, swallowing, and obstructed inspiratory efforts. Intermittently, this response pattern was more extensive and resulted in prolonged apnea. We compared the frequency of prolonged apnea immediately after saline boluses with spontaneously occurring prolonged apnea and found that apnea frequency after saline was greater than spontaneous apnea frequency in all 10 infants (p less than 0.0025). Also, the incidence of prolonged apnea occurring immediately after saline stimuli was significantly greater than that after randomly delivered control stimuli (p less than 0.005). These observations indicate that saline can induce prolonged apnea. Swallowing, a distinctive feature of the chemoreflex, occurred during 76% of spontaneous prolonged apnea spells. Spontaneous and postsaline prolonged apnea were nearly identical with respect to general features and frequency of specific airway protective responses. We conclude that the majority of spontaneous prolonged apneic spells in preterm infants have multiple features that are characteristic of an exaggerated airway protective response to an upper airway fluid stimulus. Circumstantial evidence suggests that endogenous upper airway secretions may be an important source of stimuli-inducing apneic spells in preterm infants.\r"

Lung function was assessed from partial expiratory flow volume curves generated by the rapid compression technique and was quantitated by the maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC). For the normal control group there was no significant change in VmaxFRC after the aerosol of either normal saline or metaproterenol. At baseline, the group of infants with CF had significantly lower values of VmaxFRC than did the normal control infants (202 versus 273 ml/s, p less than 0.05). The CF group demonstrated no significant change from baseline VmaxFRC after the aerosol of normal saline. However, after metaproterenol the CF group had a significant increase (p less than 0.001) in VmaxFRC, which eliminated the difference in VmaxFRC between the CF and normal control groups (267 versus 276 ml/s). We conclude that infants and young children with CF have increased bronchomotor tone and that bronchoconstriction represents a significant component of the airway obstruction present in patients with CF at this age.\r"

As some of the secretory products of these postulated airway chemoreceptors are known to adversely affect pulmonary vasomotor and bronchomotor tone, the present study was undertaken to determine if similar changes occur in the lungs of older pediatric patients with chronic respiratory disease. Immunoreactive cells were identified using the antibody-peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique and expressed as immunoreactive bronchioles/cm2 of lung tissue. In subjects dying an accidental or noncardiopulmonary death (control group: n = 48, zero to 24 yr of age), the total number of bombesin, calcitonin, and serotonin immunoreactive bronchioles/cm2 was greatest at birth, then decreased rapidly to extremely low levels after the first year of life. In the cystic fibrosis (n = 55, 3 days to 29 yr of age) and prolonged ventilation (n = 24, 4 months to 18 yr of age) groups, there was a significant increase (p less than 0.035) in bombesin, calcitonin, and serotonin immunoreactive bronchioles/cm2 from 1 to 11 yr of age. In the cystic fibrosis group, there was a sixfold increase in the number of serotonin immunoreactive bronchioles/cm2 lung tissue (p less than 0.015) compared with that in the other 2 groups during the first decade of life, suggesting a response to specific factors present only in the lungs of patients with this disease. In all 3 groups, immunoreactive cells were infrequently identified after 11 yr, implying a fundamental change in neuroendocrine cell biology coincident with the termination of lung growth and/or the onset of puberty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The stroke volume (SV) response to exercise, derived from an indirect Fick (CO2) determination of cardiac output during submaximal steady-state exercise served as the index of cardiac performance. The relationship between exercising SV and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), inspiratory duty cycle during exercise (Tl/Ttot) and exercising systemic arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) was examined in 15 studies involving 11 individuals with CF. The subjects were 12 to 25 yr of age and the FEV1 ranged from 15 to 72% predicted. Although a relationship existed between the SV expressed as a percentage of the mean predicted from height and gender (SV%) and PaO2 (r = 0.61, p less than 0.02), a more striking relationship was noted between SV% and either FEV1 or Tl/Ttot (r = 0.79 and 0.73, p less than 0.002). A multiple regression analysis of SV% identified an element of the relationship between FEV1 or Tl/Ttot and cardiac performance which was distinct from the influence of the coexisting hypoxia (p less than or equal to 0.05). The limitation in the SV response to exercise was noted to be in part reversible, coincident with an improvement in ventilatory mechanics that had occurred in 2 of the 4 persons in whom repeated studies were available. These observations suggest that in individuals with CF and a moderately severe degree of expiratory airflow limitation, there is a mechanical element of cardiopulmonary interdependence.\r"

In parallel, natural killer (NK) activity against YAC-1 tumor cells was investigated. Lung cells obtained by enzymatic digestion were found to exert detectable NA and NK activities, which were further increased after purification of LL (greater than 90% lymphocytes) by carbonyl iron and magnet treatment. Depletion experiments with antibodies and complement indicated that the effector cell of NA activity was a Thy 1.2+, L3T4+, aGM1+ lymphocyte, whereas the effector of NK activity was found to have a Thy 1.2-, aGM1+ phenotype. Preincubation of LL with anti-IgA antibodies, but not with anti-IgG, completely inhibited NA activity, suggesting that it was mediated by preexisting IgA bound to the LL surface. Furthermore, purified IgA from S107 plasmacytoma with specificity for phosphorylcholine, a component of the outer wall of S. pneumoniae, was able to enhance the antibacterial activity of LL and to restore their activity after treatment with anti-IgA. In addition, S107 antibodies were found to specifically induce antibacterial activity against S. pneumoniae in resident alveolar macrophages (AM) and peritoneal exudate cells, which did not express NA activity. We conclude that mouse LL include a subset of IgA-bearing lymphocytes with the phenotype of helper-T cells, which are able to exert NA activity against pneumococcus through an IgA-driven mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, no certain evidence of the efficacy has yet been demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial. The present study has approached this problem in 2 ways: serial analysis of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) during treatment and correlation of response to therapy with initial MIC. It was observed that after administration of antituberculosis drugs (rifampin, isoniazid, kanamycin, enviomycin, and minocycline), MIC values for the M. avium complex strain increased significantly. This change may be considered a result of suppression of relatively susceptible bacteria and as evidence of the efficacy of drugs. Furthermore, a correlation between the MIC values determined before chemotherapy with the conversion of sputum to negative was shown. The M. avium complex strains varied markedly in their susceptibility to antituberculosis drugs, and these susceptibilities were correlated with the chemotherapeutic effect. The fate of patients seemed to be greatly influenced by the susceptibilities of the strains that caused infection.\r"

Preexisting lung disease was present in 82% and alcohol abuse in 40%. Although M. avium complex was identified in 51% of the patients, M. xenopi, which is usually reported to occur infrequently, accounted for 38% of our cases and M. kansasii for only 9%. Treatment was limited by a high incidence of associated disease, in vitro drug resistance, drug toxicity, and a mortality rate of 32% within 18 months of admission. Nevertheless, bacteriologic conversion occurred in 29% of those treated. M. xenopi appears to be an important pathogen in southern Ontario. It differs from the other NTM by having a different pattern of in vitro drug resistance but not by its clinical or radiologic presentation.\r"

All subjects exhibited diffuse cerebral cortical atrophy on computerized tomography of the brain. The mean age of the group was 45.6 yr. The rebreathing technique was used to assess minute ventilation (VE) and occlusion pressure (P100) responses to progressive hypercapnia. Rebreathing runs were performed before and during the addition of an inspiratory flow-resistive load of 18 cm H2O.L-1.s. The respiratory control data of these patients were compared with data obtained by similar techniques in a matched normal volunteer control group. In the patient group, with the addition of load, the VE/PCO2 response slope decreased (p less than 0.005), whereas the P100/PCO2 response slope did not significantly change. In the control group, P100/PCO2 response slope increased with load to maintain ventilation. These results suggest that in presenile dementia, during added inspiratory load, the drop in VE is associated with an inadequate increase in respiratory neuromuscular output. This lack of load compensation in patients with presenile dementia suggests a role for the cerebral cortex in the response to externally added load.\r"

Specific lung volume and weight (volume or weight per 100 gram body weight) were increased. The amount of lung DNA was decreased, and collagen and elastin were increased. The volume proportion of alveolar walls was increased at the expense of alveolar air. Air spaces were diminished in size, and alveoli increased in number. Total phospholipids and disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) were decreased, but they were normal relative to alveolar surface area. These changes reverted towards normal as a result of insulin treatment. Rats matched in weight (undernourished animals) for the diabetic animals showed relative preservation of lung weight, increased DNA, and reduced nonconnective tissue protein, RNA, collagen, and elastin. Air spaces were enlarged, alveolar surface area was decreased, and alveoli were decreased in number. Total phospholipids and DSPC were decreased, but normal when expressed per alveolar surface area. We conclude that diabetes and undernourishment have different effects on connective tissue synthesis in the lung that affect lung growth and structure, providing further evidence for the \"fishnet\" hypothesis of alveolar growth.\r"

When they were killed at 135 to 137 days of gestation, the experimental animals had lower specific lung weights (g/kg) and lung volumes (ml/kg) and had delayed lung development by subjective microscopy. Light microscopic morphometry showed significantly less volume proportion of potential gas-exchanging air spaces, less parenchyma, and more gas-exchanging wall. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed these findings and also showed that the transition zone between conducting and gas-exchanging areas was less sharp in the experimental animals, attributed to diminished alveolarization of distal conducting airways. Transmission electron microscopy, together with morphometry, showed a diminished maturation of alveolar Type II cells, with fewer osmiophilic lamellar bodies and more glycogen. The number of mesenchymal-Type II cell interconnections was not altered. Maturation of bronchiolar epithelium was not affected, and mesenchymal-epithelial connections were not observed. We conclude that bilateral phrenic nerve section not only diminishes lung growth, but also diminishes intrauterine maturation of the alveolar well. Maturation of bronchiolar epithelium may not be affected by fetal respiration.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrosis is the accumulation of fibroblasts and the connective tissue products secreted by these cells, usually subsequent to tissue injury. While fibrosis can be useful in preserving the general structural integrity of a tissue, it often alters cell-cell and cell-connective tissue interactions, which leads to loss of tissue function. On the basis of the concept that mononuclear phagocytes can direct the development of fibrosis through the release of specific mediators that stimulate fibroblast proliferation, we propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent fibrosis by preventing the release of these specific mediators. The present study demonstrated that colchicine, a widely used and well-tolerated drug, can block alveolar macrophage release of 2 mediators associated with the development of fibrosis in interstitial lung diseases, fibronectin, and the alveolar-macrophage-derived growth factor (AMDGF). Colchicine blocked the spontaneous release of fibronectin by alveolar macrophages obtained from patients with fibrotic lung disease by 23 +/- 4% after 24 h and by greater than 90% after 72 h. AMDGF release was blocked by 68 +/- 10% after 4 h (p less than 0.01, all comparisons). The effect of colchicine was not due to nonspecific toxicity since [14C]proline tracer studies demonstrated that macrophages treated with colchicine were capable of de novo protein synthesis and the secretion of several protein products, despite the fact that fibronectin and AMDGF release were suppressed. The effect of colchicine on the spontaneous release of both fibronectin and AMDGF could be observed at concentrations less than 10 ng/ml, levels that can be achieved in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Trimellitic anhydride (TMA) is a chemical intermediate that has been shown to cause immunologically mediated respiratory syndromes in humans. We developed a rat model in which lung lesions accompanied by TMA-specific antibody resembled effects seen in humans. Two sets of experiments were undertaken to determine if TMA lung injury was primarily controlled by the immune system. Experiment 1: Rats were exposed to 95 micrograms/m3 of TMA 6 h/day, 5 days/wk for 2 wk during which time they received daily injections of either the immunosuppressant cyclophosphamide or saline. The TMA-exposed/saline control rats exhibited the usual TMA-induced lung lesions accompanied by TMA-specific antibody. However, the TMA-exposed/cyclophosphamide rats showed no lesions and no antibody. The spleen cells from all rats were subjected to lymphocyte blastogenesis assays using T- and B-cell mitogens. Results confirmed that cyclophosphamide-treated rats showed very little if any blastogenic response, whereas saline-treated rats gave the normal immune response. Thus, cyclophosphamide eliminated T- and B-cell function, which in turn prevented the occurrence of TMA lesions. Experiment 2: An initial passive transfer experiment showed that serum from TMA-sensitized rats could be adoptively transferred into naive recipient rats, which when given a single TMA inhalation challenge exhibited TMA-induced lesions. Similar attempts to transfer spleen cells or spleen cells plus serum did not predispose recipients for lesions. A second modified passive transfer of sensitized serum using a larger number of recipient rats, followed by a TMA challenge, resulted in lesions in 14 of the 16 rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have developed a rat model of TMA lung injury characterized by lung hemorrhage and an immune response to trimellityl (TM) haptenized lung proteins. The model is similar to the pulmonary disease-anemia syndrome (PDA) seen in workers exposed to TMA fumes. Sprague-Dawley rats, 15 per exposure period, inhaled micronized TMA powder, 100 micrograms/m3, 6 h/day, for 2,6, or 10 days and were sacrificed. At each time period, total, IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody to TM-rat serum albumin (TM-RSA) were measured by radiolabeled antigen binding and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). Hemorrhagic lung foci, weight, and displacement volume were determined, and lungs were examined by light and electron microscopy. There was no lung injury or antibody response at 2 days. There was minimal lung injury at 6 days with low levels of antibody in BAL and serum. At 10 days, there was a marked increase in hemorrhagic foci and in BAL and serum antibody levels. BAL antibody levels at 6 and 10 days had higher correlations with measures of lung injury than corresponding serum levels. There was minimal ultrastructural change at 6 days. By Day 10, there was marked intraalveolar hemorrhage, alveolar septal inflammatory nodules, abundant alveolar macrophages, and evidence of endothelial and epithelial cell injury. These results indicate that the immune response to inhaled TMA occurs parallel with the development of lung lesions, and antibody levels in BAL and serum are highly correlated with lung injury.\r"

  ".W": "Diaphragmatic fatigue may play an important role in precipitating acute respiratory failure. Pharmacologically, theophylline and beta-2 agonists have been used to improve diaphragmatic contractility. We designed experiments to study the effects of albuterol, a beta-2 agonist, on diaphragmatic fatigue in humans. In 5 normal subjects, fatigue was induced by breathing through an inspiratory resistance. Studies were done at 2 levels of diaphragmatic tension-time index (TTdi) of 0.25 and 0.30. At each TTdi, either placebo or albuterol (4 mg three times daily) was taken for 3 days. All subjects experienced side effects of sympathetic stimulation. Albuterol did not significantly increase the strength of the fresh diaphragm. With a TTdi of 0.25, values for mean endurance time were 649 +/- 250 (mean +/- SE) and 552 +/- 161 s, respectively, in placebo and albuterol runs. Respective values for TTdi of 0.30 were 109 +/- 14 and 143 +/- 27 s. During recovery, the mean values for the time needed for maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdimax) to reach 90% of the prefatigue Pdimax were 891 +/- 370 and 1043 +/- 394 s, respectively, for placebo and albuterol runs (TTdi = 0.25). Respective values for TTdi of 0.30 were 219 +/- 57 and 231 +/- 108 s. We conclude that, in humans, albuterol has no significant effect on the strength of the fresh or fatigued diaphragm, diaphragm endurance time, or the recovery of Pdimax from fatigue.\r"

The sense of effort was assessed in 6 subjects with COPD during bicycle exercise continued to a symptom-limited maximal work load using a conventional category scale. Reproducibility of the sensory experience was assessed by comparing results obtained from 3 incremental work tests, 2 on the same day and a subsequent test performed within 1 to 10 days. During all trials in all subjects, sensory scores correlated closely with both minute ventilation and oxygen consumption (r greater than or equal to 0.92 for both VE and VO2). The average coefficients of variation for the maximal Borg Score and Borg Score at 2 min of exercise for the group as a whole were 3 +/- 1 and 3 +/- 2% (SE), respectively. Variability in sensory scores was not significantly different on exercise trials performed either within or between days. Furthermore, variability of sensory scores, oxygen consumption, heart rate, or minute ventilation were similar. We conclude that when using a category scale in subjects with COPD, the perceived sense of effort in breathing during exercise is highly reproducible, correlates closely with physiologic measures defining the intensity of exercise, and is no more variable than physiologic parameters typically measured during an exercise test.\r"

The drug is administered to ARDS patients by continuous intravenous infusion at dosage rates of up to 30 ng/kg/min for 7 days. The present study was conducted to determine the pulmonary extraction efficiency and pharmacokinetics of PGE1 under these conditions. Plasma levels of PGE1 were determined by high performance liquid chromatography in 14 patients who either had ARDS or were considered to be at risk of developing ARDS following trauma or sepsis. Predose plasma levels of PGE1 were below the detection limit of the assay (50 pg/ml). At a dosage rate of 30 ng/kg/min, pulmonary arterial and systemic arterial plasma levels ranged from 265 to 1,009 pg/ml and 50 to 796 pg/ml, respectively. The pulmonary extraction ratio (Ep) of PGE1 varied from 0.11 to 0.90 and was independent of dose but dependent on cardiac output. The data were adequately described by first-order pharmacokinetic equations which assumed that the lung was the only site of PGE1 clearance. Nine of 10 patients with AaPO2/FlO2 below 510 mm Hg had Ep greater than 0.7 and high pulmonary intrinsic clearance for PGE1 (ca. 250 L/min), but all 4 patients with AaPO2/FlO2 above 510 mm Hg had Ep less than 0.6 and low intrinsic clearance (ca. 37 L/min or less). The intrinsic clearance of the lung for PGE1 in ARDS patients therefore appears to decrease abruptly once a threshold of severe respiratory failure is achieved.\r"

To investigate the potential role for oxidant-mediated modulation of BHR, we investigated oxidative metabolism of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) from the peripheral blood in 28 nonallergic patients with chronic air-flow obstruction (CAO). No difference in O2- was found between 14 smokers and 14 ex-smokers with CAO. A significant correlation was found between the degree of BHR and O2(-)-generation of PMN after stimulation with 20 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate, both in smokers (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01) and in ex-smokers (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01). In the light of other findings in experimental animal studies, the results suggest a direct or indirect role for O2- in the modulation of BHR. Thus, in nonallergic patients with CAO, BHR and inflammation may be linked in a similar way as in allergic patients with asthma.\r"

Objectives were to study the recovery of pulmonary AB by BAL and the ability of BAL concentrations to predict parenchymal concentrations. BAL and parenchymal concentrations were both spread over 6 orders of magnitude and were positively correlated (r = 0.74 between logarithmic values). It is believed that, by a process of progressive elution, AB firmly adherent to the alveolar wall become suspended in BAL fluid; such suspended bodies represent roughly 2% of all the bodies stored in the portion of lung lavaged. Recovery is associated with great interindividual variations. When a measured BAL concentration exceeds 1 AB/ml, it can be quite confidently predicted, however, that the parenchymal concentration is in excess of 1,000 AB/g and that the patient has experienced a nontrivial asbestos exposure.\r"

Previous studies have shown that the inflammatory cell population of the distal lung units of patients with this disorder can be accurately assessed using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The present study evaluated the uniformity of BAL between different sites of the lung in patients with sarcoidosis. In general, there was a good correlation between sites for percentages of lymphocytes (LYM) (r = 0.750, p less than 0.0001), LYM number (r = 0.356, p = 0.0007), percentages of neutrophils (NEUT) (r = 0.917, p less than 0.0001), NEUT number (r = 0.999, p less than 0.0001), and macrophage (MAC) number (r = 0.858, p less than 0.001). Despite the good overall correlation, we found that 43% of the patients with high percent LYM (greater than 30%) had this finding on one side only. These patients did not differ from the group as a whole based on radiographic stage of their disease but did differ in the number of radiographs demonstrating focal infiltrates (2 of 28 patients with both sides less than 30% LYM, 2 of 14 with both sides greater than 30% LYM, and 4 of 9 with only one side greater than 30% LYM p less than 0.05 by chi-square); and in each situation the highest percent LYM was seen on the side with focal changes on the chest radiograph.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Survival rates did not depend on the availability of a specific diagnosis, changes in diagnosis, or changes in therapy. Survival was improved in younger patients and patients not requiring preoperative mechanical ventilation. Fifteen patients (19%) suffered complications possibly related to OLB; the survival rate to discharge was decreased in these patients, although not significantly. We conclude that OLB provides a specific etiologic diagnosis in many patients with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and ARF, but that its utility in these patients is limited by current shortcomings of therapy.\r"

The operative mortality in the patients with the combined complications (44%, 4/9) was significantly higher than that in patients with bleeding alone (8/82, 9.8, P less than 0.001) or those with perforation alone (4/36, 11.00, P less than 0.025). The mean age of nonsurvivors was significantly higher than that of the survivors (74 +/- 8.01 vs 50.4 +/- 5.65 years, P less than 0.005). The duration of symptoms until operation was longer in patients who died (63 +/- 12.7 hours) than in survivors (40.2 +/- 6.02 hours, P = NS). All patients who died, and three of five survivors, had preoperative fever (greater than 99.0 F), leukocytosis (greater than 12,000/mm3), and persistent tachycardia despite adequate hydration and blood replacement. Perforation in bleeding peptic ulcers is not an uncommon finding, and was present in 9.9 per cent of patients. The presenting symptom of bleeding may obscure signs of perforation, delay surgery, and contribute to the higher mortality rate. The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia despite adequate fluid and blood replacement warrants a suspicion of perforation in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty three operations for common bile duct (CBD) stricture were performed on 22 consecutive patients by a single surgeon without the use of transanastomotic stents. All strictures resulted from operative injury; four were acute (less than 1 month postinjury), and 18 were treated a mean of 44 months (2-124 months) after injury. All but two of these patients had had previous repair attempts. Mean follow-up after reconstruction was 72 months (17-128 months). Reconstructive procedures included hepaticojejunostomy seven, choledochojejunostomy ten, and choledochoduodenostomy six. Twenty one of the 22 patients (95%) have had excellent results, with stable liver function an no evidence of cholangitis or jaundice. Early postoperative complications (one abscess, one fistula) resolved. In two of the 22, stricture recurred at one and five months, requiring balloon dilatation in one and reoperation in the other. Both are now asymptomatic at 37 and 64 months. Reoperation was also required to remove an infected distal CBD stump in one patient 29 months after reconstruction, and another had mild intermittent cholangitis, now resolved. The only death occurred 70 months after reconstruction in a patient who developed biliary cirrhosis. These results suggest that biliary enteric anastomosis for acute and chronic bile duct strictures associated with benign disease can be performed without stenting, yielding low postoperative morbidity and excellent long-term patency.\r"

  ".W": "The routine use of intraoperative cholangiography has vastly improved the results of common duct exploration by reducing the number of negative explorations. The controversy surrounding the use of routine versus selective intraoperative cholangiography has centered on the incidence of unsuspected common-duct stones. A prospective study was designed to examine both preoperative clinical data and intraoperative anatomical information to determine criteria that would identify patients who would not require cholangiography. One hundred consecutive patients undergoing cholecystectomy were included in the study. When considering patients without preoperative clinical data suspicious for common duct stones three anatomical conditions were identified in which common duct stones would not be present: cystic duct less than 3 mm; smallest stone size greater than 6 mm; a single stone. Using intraoperative criteria as a basis for cholangiography, 44 per cent of patients without clinical suspicion of common duct stones would be spared an intraoperative cholangiogram. It is the authors' opinion that the addition of anatomic findings to preoperative clinical data can further reduce or eliminate the risk of unsuspected stones while sparing a large number of patients the risk and expense of routine intraoperative cholangiography and possible negative duct exploration.\r"

This study focused on the clinical presentations, surgical management, and overall morbidity and mortality of this operative procedure in the elderly. There were 81 women and 56 men in the study ranging in age from 70 to 96. Elective procedures were performed in (78/137) 57 per cent of the patients while (59/137) 43 per cent underwent emergency surgery. Elective procedures were performed in (55/81) 68 per cent of the women and (23/56) 41 per cent of the men. Emergency surgery was required in (26/81) 32 per cent of the women and (33/56) 60 per cent of the men. Complications developed in (16/78) 20 per cent of the elective cases and (19/59) 32 per cent of the emergency cases. In the elective group, the most common complication involved the cardiovascular system. Sepsis with multiple organ failure accounted for all the deaths in the emergency group. Among the 137 patients in this series, there was a (3/78) 3.8 per cent mortality in the elective group and a (7/59) 12 per cent mortality in the emergency group with an overall mortality of (10/137) 7.3 per cent. The purpose of this study was to highlight the necessity for aggressive surgical management of biliary tract disease in the elderly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Long Memorial Hospital were reviewed. Of 79 patients with AIDS or ARC diagnosed since 1982, 14 required major abdominal surgery. Operations performed were for gastrointestinal (GI) complications of opportunistic infections and neoplasms (four), diagnosis of major retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (four), and treatment of AIDS-related immune thrombocytopenia (six). GI complications consisted of two cases of cytomegalovirus perforation of ileum and colon, one case of bleeding ileocolonic lymphoma, and one case of cryptosporidium cholecystitis. Laparotomy for diagnosis of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy was performed in four patients and provided diagnostic material in three of them. Six patients underwent splenectomy for AIDS-related immune thrombocytopenia. Four of these patients had previously been treated with prednisone without impressive results. All patients had marked improvement of their platelet counts and clinical bleeding after splenectomy. Postoperative complications were common and consisted of wound infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, GI bleeding, pneumocystis pneumonia, small-bowel obstruction, and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. One patient died after laparotomy for perforated ulcers of the ileum and colon.\r"

  ".W": "In the past six years, percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) has been performed in the treatment of 99 patients with abdominal and retroperitoneal abscesses. Of these 99 patients, 15 had abscesses associated with an enteric fistula. Fistula sites included small bowel (five), colon (three), complex (three), duodenum (two) and one each for the stomach and common duct. Two of these 15 patients had an initially successful PCD, ten developed recurrent abscesses after the first PCD and the procedure failed in the remaining three patients. Of the ten patients with recurrent abscesses, eight were successfully treated by a second PCD while two required small-bowel resection. Of the three failures, all three required operation and eventually died of septic complications. The diagnosis of fistula was made at the initial PCD in only six of 15 cases. There was a significant correlation between PCD failure and presence of an enteric fistula (P less than 0.001 by chi-square test). These data suggest that the diagnosis of fistula associated with abdominal abscess is elusive, but once established, most recurrent abscesses can be successfully treated by a second PCD. Operative treatment of recurrent fistula-related abscesses should be reserved for persistent fistula drainage after a second PCD or for unresolved sepsis following the initial PCD.\r"

An increase in the level of plasma MB creatine kinase activity was used to detect extension, which occurred in 71 of 848 patients (8.4%). For these patients, hospital mortality was more than four times higher than for those without extension (30% versus 7%, P less than 0.01). However, for patients surviving the initial hospitalization, there was no significant difference in mortality during the following year (12% compared with 9%). Multivariable analyses indicated that extension was more likely to occur in patients with recurrent ischemic pain during the second hospital day, a history of previous myocardial infarction, and ST segment depression on the admission electrocardiogram. The occurrence of extension in patients with two of these risk factors was more than twice that of patients without any of the risk factors (15.1% compared with 5.8%). Patients with these risk factors should be considered for early coronary angiography and possible intervention to prevent infarct extension and its sequellae.\r"

Examination of the balance between undergraduate and graduate medical education in the 127 networks of each medical school in the United States and its associated hospitals showed major differences in the retention and recruitment of graduates. The service needs of hospitals rather than the number of graduates from schools in the United States would seem to have controlled the number of positions. Because the positions exceeding the number of graduates from the United States are filled by graduates of foreign schools, these positions are of major importance in determining the supply of internists. The clerkship programs must be restructured to provide students an improved introduction to internal medicine, and the number of entering positions in residencies must be reduced by the substitution of other personnel to do some of the service functions now done by residents.\r"

Misunderstandings that surround the term \"standard of care\" have encouraged fears of liability and have led to the practice of defensive medicine. Physicians may consider the standard of care to be a technical or legal obligation, but an optimal standard would be one based on detailed knowledge of a patient's medical history and personal condition. It would include the physician's clinical judgment, which integrates specific technical and legal information with clinical experience in caring for patients. Occasionally, such judgment may conflict with the rulings of a court, which considers technical and legal information without the benefit of clinical judgment. Physicians must be prepared to be advocates for their patients, especially when legal proceedings are flawed or injurious. Systematic processes of examination and analysis, such as those used by ethics consultants, can help resolve questions about the standard of care.\r"

Among all patients, the presence of normal metaphases in tumor material was associated with a higher complete remission rate and longer survival. However, the duration of complete remission did not correlate with the presence or absence of chromosomal changes. Among patients with follicular lymphomas, the presence of normal metaphases in the tumor material was again associated with a higher rate of complete remission and with longer survival. Patients with structural abnormalities of chromosome 17 had a shorter survival than patients without these abnormalities. Among the patients with diffuse large-cell and immunoblastic lymphomas, those with breaks in the short arm of chromosome 2 had a longer survival than those without these breaks. We conclude that chromosomal abnormalities are predictive of clinical outcome in malignant lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "Although cisplatin nephrotoxicity is well documented, renal sodium wasting has rarely been reported. Seven of seventy patients treated with cisplatin over 18 months developed salt-wasting nephropathy and orthostatic hypotension. All patients presented 2 to 4 months after starting cisplatin with severe orthostatic hypotension (mean orthostatic change in blood pressure, -37 +/- 8 mm Hg) without preceding extrarenal volume loss or diuretic use. Urinary sodium concentration was 85 to 145 mmol/L, fractional excretion of sodium was 1.0% to 8.0%, and urinary osmolar concentration was 340 to 619 mmol/kg, while orthostatic hypotension was present. Six patients were hyponatremic (116 to 137 mmol/L). Serum creatinine and urea levels were elevated in five patients but fell after rehydration. Vasopressin averaged 5.4 pg/mL (2.1 to 12.7 pg/mL) (n = 5) and was suppressed with hydration (mean, 2.5 pg/mL, 1.5 to 4.3 pg/mL). Plasma renin activity was undetectable in two patients and low in three patients, and aldosterone was low in six patients despite clinical volume depletion. Cisplatin may produce renal salt wasting causing symptomatic orthostatic hypotension and hyponatremia associated with abnormalities of the renin-aldosterone system.\r"

Histologic examination of the gland revealed pathologic changes compatible with Hashimoto disease, and lymphocytes isolated from her thyroid gland were transformed into lymphoblastoid cells in vitro by Epstein-Barr virus in the presence of cyclosporine. These cells produced antibodies against thyroglobulin, thyroid microsome, thyrocyte membrane, and thyrotropin, whereas lymphoblastoid cells produced from the patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes showed no antithyroid activity. Several human monoclonal antibodies were produced from the intrathyroidal lymphocytes by fusion with the SHM-D33 heteromyeloma, and the resulting cell lines produced antibodies with high-affinity binding specific for thyroid antigens. These studies show that lymphocytes capable of producing antithyroid antibodies can be present in the thyroid glands of patients with Hashimoto disease without evidence of a peripheral immune response, thus indicating that Hashimoto disease can exist as an organ-restricted autoimmune disorder.\r"

To review the incidence, types, and outcome of gram-positive infections in a series of neutropenic patients with cancer. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Inpatient units of the Medical and Pediatric Oncology Branches of the National Cancer Institute. PATIENTS: Five hundred and fifty consecutive episodes of fever and neutropenia in patients with cancer randomized prospectively on another study to receive either ceftazidime alone or combination antibiotics for initial empirical therapy. INTERVENTION: Intravenous vancomycin (dosage adjusted by serum levels). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gram-positive organisms were the commonest of the bacterial pathogens isolated (63%). Of the 53 gram-positive organisms accounting for primary infections (isolated at initial presentation), there were 36 staphylococcal isolates (19 coagulase-negative and 17 coagulase-positive), 13 streptococcal isolates (8 non-group D and 5 group D), and 4 polymicrobial isolates. Of the 22 secondary gram-positive infections (occurring after institution of initial antibiotics), there were 10 streptococcal isolates (9 group D and 1 non-group D), 7 staphylococcal isolates (6 coagulase-negative and 1 coagulase-positive), and 5 polymicrobial isolates. Vancomycin was used to treat 26 of the 53 primary infections, but was begun only after knowledge of the isolate in 25. Vancomycin was used to treat 17 of the 22 secondary infections, and begun only after knowledge of the isolate in 14. This approach resulted in no treatment failures for the primary infections, and a single microbiological failure for the secondary infections. There was a tendency towards a greater proportion of secondary gram-positive infections in the monotherapy group compared to the combination therapy group (16 of 282 compared with 6 of 268 respectively, P2 = 0.04 by the chi-squared test); but all were treated successfully. CONCLUSION: Vancomycin need not be included in routine empirical therapy for febrile neutropenic patients, but should be added when clinical or microbiological data suggest the need.\r"

No false-positive results occurred in this series, but five false-negative results were seen in the 10 patients with hyperplasia on fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens who subsequently had open surgical biopsy. From our experience, we believe fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a useful, cost-effective initial method to evaluate lymphadenopathy in patients seen at an AIDS outpatient clinic.\r"

Thirty-seven patients with AIDS and toxoplasmic encephalitis and 11 patients with AIDS alone were studied. All patients had serum IgG but not IgM Toxoplasma antibodies. Twenty-three of the patients with AIDS and toxoplasmic encephalitis had Toxoplasma antibody in cerebrospinal fluid compared to none of the patients with AIDS alone. Of the patients with AIDS alone who had serum antibodies to T. gondii, none had Toxoplasma antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid. Production of antibodies in the central nervous system was seen in 11 of 16 patients with AIDS and toxoplasmic encephalitis but not in 4 patients in the control group who only had Toxoplasma antibody in their cerebrospinal fluid. These results suggest that production of T. gondii antibodies in the central nervous system may be diagnostic of toxoplasmic encephalitis.\r"

Antibodies to hepatitis delta virus were found in 16 of 106 men in Los Angeles (15.1%; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 8.3% to 21.9%); 6 of 64 men in San Francisco (9.4%; 95% Cl, 3.5% to 19.3%); 1 of 76 men in Pittsburgh (1.3%; 95% Cl, 0.03% to 7.1%); and 0 of 52 men in Chicago (0%; 95% Cl, 0% to 5.6%). From 44.0% to 65.4% of men negative for hepatitis delta virus and all men positive for hepatitis delta virus but one (P less than 0.0001) were positive for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In multivariate analysis, infection with hepatitis delta virus was associated with intravenous drug use (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 6.7, P less than 0.01), with sexual activity as measured by number of partners (adjusted OR = 8.4, p less than 0.01), and probably with rectal trauma (adjusted OR = 3.9, P = 0.17). As with HIV infection, prevalence of hepatitis delta virus infection in homosexual men differs by location and is most likely transmitted both sexually and parenterally.\r"

Dichloroacetate was administered intravenously over 30 minutes as two 50 mg/kg body weight doses separated by 2 hours. Five patients underwent retreatment with two additional drug doses and were considered new cases when analyzing for treatment response. Survival, however, was determined from the time of initial entry into the study. Patients were considered to respond to treatment if arterial lactate concentration decreased at least 20% from the pretreatment level within 6 hours of beginning the first dichloroacetate infusion. Using this criterion, 26 cases responded to therapy with dichloroacetate. For all cases, patients' mean arterial lactate concentration decreased 52% (P = 0.0009), arterial bicarbonate concentration increased 35% (P = 0.0003), and arterial pH increased (P = 0.024) to normal, defined as the range 7.35 to 7.45. Among responders, however, arterial lactate concentration decreased 74% (P = 0.0001), arterial bicarbonate level increased 47% (P = 0.0001), and arterial pH increased (P = 0.0004) to the normal range. Median survival time among responders was 60 hours, compared to 26 hours among nonresponders (P less than 0.001). There was no evidence of toxicity to dichloroacetate.\r"

Prevalence increases dramatically with age (P less than 0.001), with 33% of men and 49% of women age 70 or older affected. A significant association between blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy is present and occurs at levels of systolic pressure below 140 mm Hg (age adjusted, P less than 0.001). There is a ninefold (women) to tenfold (men) increase from leanest to most obese group (age adjusted, P less than 0.001). In multivariate analysis, age, blood pressure, obesity, valve disease, and myocardial infarction are independently associated in both sexes. We conclude that left ventricular hypertrophy is a common echocardiographic finding for which several risk factors can be identified. These findings support weight reduction and blood pressure control for prevention or regression of this condition.\r"

Biopsy specimens were obtained from the exposed areas at five minutes and two and 24 hours later, as well as from adjacent nonexposed skin. Lesions showed a statistically significant dose-dependent increase, predominantly perivascular, in upper dermal neutrophil and eosinophil numbers at five minutes and two hours, but not at 24 hours, and at higher radiation doses in mononuclear cell numbers by 24 hours. Nonirradiated patient skin and irradiated control subject skin was not similarly affected. These changes may be associated with the pathogenesis of solar urticaria.\r"

Punch biopsy specimens were taken before and after water contact; the specimens were immediately frozen, sectioned, and stained histochemically for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. This was localized in the nerve fibers surrounding eccrine sweat glands and was quantified by microspectrophotometry. In AP and polycythemia rubra vera after water exposure a significantly increased AChE activity suggesting acetylcholine release was observed, whereas in the patient with cold urticaria and the controls, a significant decrease was noted. Two related patients with AP had an inherited abnormality of serum cholinesterase, which, however, had no obvious correlation with their particular disease. The proof of AChE activation might support the clinical diagnosis and indicate a hypothetical involvement of eccrine sweat glands in the pathogenesis of AP.\r"

Tissue sampled from five sites that varied in clinical presentation revealed striking changes in the dermoepidermal junction, elastic fibers of the papillary and reticular dermis, and adipose tissue of the hypodermis. The density and organization of the collagenous connective tissue was altered variably depending on the biopsy site. Changes noted in the epidermis were indicative of tissue regeneration and repair. Cells derived from acral areas grew poorly and could not be passed. Collagen synthesis in these cells was enhanced approximately 50%, and collagenase expression was decreased to a similar degree. Cells derived from the skin of the trunk could be passed but had an abbreviated in vitro life span. Collagen synthesis in these cells was unaltered. Serum from the patient with Werner's syndrome or from his obligate heterozygote offspring stimulated collagen synthesis in low-passage normal human skin fibroblast target cells. Sequential passage of these normal cells resulted in a blunting of the stimulatory effect. These observations suggest that a stimulator of collagen synthesis exists in the serum of patients with Werner's syndrome and that as cells (either normal or Werner's syndrome) \"age\" in vitro they may become hyporesponsive to this as yet undefined stimulatory factor in serum.\r"

The strictures were identified by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). All patients with pancreatic cancer and gallstone pancreatitis were excluded. The mean alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin values were 344 +/- 57 IU/dl and 4.4 +/- 0.7 mg/dl, respectively. The mean stricture length was 3.9 +/- 0.5 cm, and the mean common bile duct (CBD) diameter was 1.8 +/- 0.2 cm. The degree of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevation did not correlate with stricture length or the severity of bile duct dilatation. Eighteen of the 38 patients received surgical biliary drainage (BD) as part of their initial therapy, and 20 patients did not. Liver function tests, intrapancreatic stricture length, and the degree of proximal CBD dilation were comparable in these two groups. Patients not undergoing BD did well clinically as only one patient required BD over an average follow-up period of 3.8 years. In conclusion, bypass of these strictures is usually unnecessary, and most patients may be safely treated without operation.\r"

Persistent or recurrent urinary tract infection was a complaint in all cases, and 11 patients reported pneumaturia and/or fecaluria. Thus, bladder involvement was either suspected or clinically apparent in each patient. The cystogram was the best confirmatory test for the ileovesical fistula (positive in 9 of 22 patients). The coexistence of the sigmoid fistula was best diagnosed on intestinal radiographs (positive in 9 of 22 patients); there were no clinical signs of its presence. The coexistence of ileosigmoid and ileovesical fistulae was the sole indication for operation in two patients. In all others, a combination of factors required surgical therapy. An ileocolonic resection with primary intestinal anastomosis was performed in 16 patients and exteriorization was performed in six patients. The sigmoid defect was closed primarily in 16 patients and required wedge resection in the other six patients. The bladder defect was sparingly excised and closed with absorbable sutures. All patients recuperated without anastomotic leaks, bladder leaks, or persistent cystitis. This experience indicates that coexisting ileosigmoid and ileovesical fistulae may add complexity to an ileocolonic resection for Crohn's disease, but is not a difficult management problem for the gastrointestinal surgeon.\r"

Patients received 4500-5500 cGy (rad) of fractionated, multiple field external beam irradiation and an IORT dose of 1000-2000 cGy. Thirty of 51 patients (59%) are alive and 22 patients (43%) are free of disease. In 44 patients at risk greater than or equal to 1 year, local progression within the IORT field has occurred in 1 of 44 (2%) and within the external beam field in 8 of 44 (18%). All local failures have occurred in patients with recurrence or with gross residual after partial resection, and the risk was less in patients who received 5FU during external irradiation (1 of 11, 9% vs. 6 of 31, 19%). The incidence of distant metastases is high in patients with recurrence, but subsequent peritoneal failures are infrequent. Acute and chronic tolerance have been acceptable, but peripheral nerve appears to be a dose-limiting structure. Randomized trials are needed to determine whether potential gains with IORT are real.\r"

Fifteen (23%) were in the cecum, 3 (5%) in the right colon, 1 (1%) in the splenic flexure, 10 (15%) in the sigmoid colon, and 36 (55%) in the rectum. The most common symptoms were rectal bleeding (70%), mucus diarrhea (44%), constipation (22%), and tenesmus (19%). Fifty-five (85%) of these large adenomas contained invasive adenocarcinoma and one in situ carcinoma. Two thirds of invasive carcinomas arose from predominantly villous adenomas and one third from tubulovillous adenomas. Half of all malignant adenomas demonstrated metastases to regional lymph nodes or distant metastases. Seven malignant adenomas (12%) were associated with synchronous adenocarcinomas of the colon, and 29% of malignant adenomas were associated with synchronous adenomatous polyps, principally tubular type. Four of nine benign, large adenomas were associated with synchronous adenomas but with no adenocarcinomas. No relationship was found between the size of the adenoma, location, or Dukes' stage. Though the incidence of in situ and invasive carcinomas is clearly related to the size of the adenoma, a linear relationship could not be demonstrated.\r"

The odds ratio for complication for men versus women was 1.75: for no antibiotics versus antibiotic prophylaxis it was 2.5. Relative to distal resection the odds ratio for complications after subtotal resection was 2.2, for total gastrectomy was 3.9, and for proximal resection was 7.6. Age and sex were the only factors that affected operative mortality. The odds ratio for mortality for men versus women was 2.3.

All patients had radical or modified radical mastectomies and did not show any evidence of distant metastases at the time of operation. Median follow-up was 37 months. An additional 117 patients received some form of adjuvant therapy, mainly chemotherapy, and were analyzed separately. Life table analysis using the log rank test for measuring significance, and a Cox multivariate analysis was performed. At 48 months, 22% of the ER positive (ER+) group versus 33% of the ER negative (ER-) group had recurred as compared to 16% and 35% for the PR+ versus PR- groups, respectively. Life table analysis of the disease free interval (DFI) showed that the difference between the ER+ and ER- groups was not significant (p greater than 0.1), while the difference in DFI between the PR+ and PR- groups was significant (p less than 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the most important factors in predicting the DFI were nodal status (p less than 0.001), tumor size (p less than 0.025), and progesterone receptor status (p less than 0.05). Estrogen receptor status was not found to be significant. In conclusion, PR- patients have a shorter DFI than PR+ patients and that PR status is a more valuable predictor of DFI than ER status.\r"

The fistulas were due to either biliary obstruction or infectious diseases involving the liver. All patients had biloptysis and other respiratory symptoms, and most had cholangitis, jaundice, and/or sepsis. The diagnosis was established by fistulography or cholangiography. All patients except one were treated surgically by relief of biliary obstruction and drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses. All 15 surgically treated patients had a successful outcome. Rapid diagnosis and early treatment of septic complications are necessary, but careful assessment and surgical relief of the biliary obstruction are essential in successfully treating this condition.\r"

This report describes the cases of 2 patients in whom obstruction to left coronary artery flow was caused by obliteration of the coronary ostium itself. This mechanism differs from the more commonly recognized cause--valve leaflet adhesion to the obstructing ridge of aortic tissue. The coronary artery obstruction found in these 2 patients required direct enlargement of the left coronary ostium in both. This mechanism of impaired coronary artery flow deserves emphasis, as traditional methods of extended patch aortoplasty may fail to relieve the coronary ostial narrowing.\r"

This technique consists of the division of the anterior leaflet into anterior and posterior segments, the shifting and reattachment of the divided segments to the mitral ring of the respective commissural areas, and the use of a low-profile bileaflet prosthetic valve. A comparison of left ventricular function data between patients having operation with this technique and those having operation with the conventional method of MVR revealed significantly better improvement in cardiac index (p less than 0.06), left ventricular end-systolic volume index (p less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.10) in the former group. Left ventricular wall motion improved in the anterolateral (p less than 0.01) and apical areas (p less than 0.02) in patients operated on with our technique. Maintenance of continuity between the mitral annulus and papillary muscles is expected to have a beneficial effect on postoperative left ventricular performance in spite of increased afterload.\r"

By block randomization, patients scheduled for an elective cardiac operation or coronary artery angioplasty were assigned to shower with one of the study skin cleansers either once (evening only) or twice (both evening and morning) before the procedure. Semiquantitative samples for culture were obtained from the subclavian and inguinal sites on the evening before the procedure (baseline culture) and again the next morning before the operation. The chlorhexidine skin cleanser consistently reduced staphylococcal colony counts at both the subclavian and inguinal sites before the procedure. This reduction was significant for patients showering both evening and morning (p less than 0.05). The use of the povidone-iodine skin cleanser inconsistently affected skin flora. Patients using lotion soap either experienced no change or had an increase in colony counts. Chlorhexidine is more effective than povidone-iodine in diminishing skin colonization with staphylococci in patients before operation. Repeated applications of chlorhexidine are superior to a single shower with this agent.\r"

To investigate the effect of this observation, 22 pigs underwent 2 hours (Group 1, r = 10) or 3 hours (Group 2, r = 12) of myocardial ischemia during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at 26 degrees C; the myocardium was protected by cardioplegic solution and cold saline solution at 30-minute intervals. After the pig was rewarmed to 37 degrees C, CPB was discontinued, and measurements of hemodynamic function were made 10 and 70 minutes later. Half of the pigs (Subgroup B) received 6 micrograms of T3 intravenously immediately after removal of the aortic cross-clamp; the remainder (Subgroup A) received no T3. After 2 hours of ischemia, untreated pigs showed significantly reduced myocardial function 10 minutes after discontinuation of CPB. By 70 minutes after the end of CPB, 2 of 5 untreated pigs (Subgroup A) had died of low cardiac output, but all 5 treated pigs (Subgroup B) survived. After 3 hours of ischemia, both groups showed some reduced function at 10 minutes, though the reduction was more marked in untreated animals. By 70 minutes, 4 of 6 untreated pigs had died of myocardial failure and all treated pigs remained alive (p less than 0.03). Surviving pigs in both groups still demonstrated some reduced function compared with values obtained before CPB. When all pigs are considered together, overall survival of those that did not receive T3 was significantly less than those that did (p less than 0.006).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The overall operative mortality was 12%, but mortality was higher among patients less than 2 years of age, patients who had had previous cardiac operations, and patients requiring double-valve replacement. Seven of 11 patients who received mechanical valves and no anticoagulation experienced major thromboembolic events. An episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage that was easily controlled represents the only bleeding complication in the entire series. Valve replacement in children continues to be a high-risk procedure, and efforts to preserve native valve function should be attempted when technically feasible. Our data also suggest that anticoagulation can be safely accomplished in the pediatric age group and should be employed in patients requiring placement of a mechanical prosthesis, especially in the mitral position.\r"

Indications for bilobectomy were tumor extending across a fissure (45%), absent fissure (21%), endobronchial tumor (14%), extrinsic tumor or nodal invasion of bronchus intermedius (10%), and vascular invasion (5%). Thirty-one patients (19%) suffered 41 perioperative complications, and 7 patients (4.2%) died. Upper and middle lobectomies were not associated with a significantly different morbidity (p greater than 0.10) or mortality (p greater than 0.10) when compared with middle and lower lobectomy. The postoperative chest roentgenograms of all patients demonstrated ipsilateral volume loss, and 31 patients were found to have asymptomatic hydropneumothoraces, which cleared during the follow-up period. Late complications occurred in 4 patients (2%) and included two empyemas, one bronchopleural fistula, and one superficial wound infection. These results indicate that bilobectomy is associated with morbidity and mortality that lie between those currently reported for lobectomy and pneumonectomy.\r"

Of the 319 prostheses at risk, 114 instances of primary tissue valve failure occurred. Seventy-three of the failed valves were in the mitral position, and 41 were in the aortic position. The calculated actuarial probability of freedom from primary tissue valve failure was 52 +/- 5% for the mitral and 58 +/- 6% for the aortic prostheses at 12.5 years of follow-up. For patients older than 40 years at the time of operation, the rate of freedom from primary failure was 68 +/- 8% and 55 +/- 6% for aortic and mitral prostheses, respectively, at 12.5 years. Comparison of both actuarial curves disclosed no meaningful difference. However, a tendency toward greater failure rate was observed in the mitral prosthesis group.\r"

Therefore, the predictive rules for placing a transannular patch, rules derived from patients in whom the right ventricular approach was used and depending in part on the fall in PRV/LV during the first 24 hours after operation, are also applicable to patients in whom an atrial approach, with or without a transpulmonary approach, is used.\r"

Multiple doses of either blood cardioplegia (Group 1; N = 11) or crystalloid cardioplegia (Group 2; N = 11) were administered during 4 hours of aortic cross-clamping. The accumulation of hydrogen ions during the cross-clamp period was greater in Group 2 than Group 1 in the LV endo region (629 +/- 79 nm/L versus 66 +/- 31 nm/L; p less than 0.001), the LV epi region (623 +/- 66 nm/L versus 72 +/- 32 nm/L; p less than 0.001), and the RV myocardium (814 +/- 296 nm/L versus 150 +/- 54 nm/L; p less than 0.05). Within each group, the time course of myocardial pH and the accumulation of hydrogen ions did not differ among the LV endo region, LV epi region, and the RV myocardium (p = not significant). These data indicate that transmural and interventricular differences in myocardial pH and hydrogen ion accumulation are not produced in the vented, arrested canine heart. In addition, when compared with asanguineous cardioplegia, blood cardioplegia globally and transmurally reduces acid accumulation during ischemic arrest.\r"

This technique delineates the fluid distribution and the site of adhesions, defines the path for introduction of an aspiration needle, alerts to the possibility of myocardial contact, and helps in positioning the drainage catheter. Two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging can be performed at the patient's bedside, and the images are easy to interpret. This technique simplifies pericardiocentesis and helps to avoid complications.\r"

  ".W": "The epidemiology, significance, and clinical consequences of influenza in the hospital setting were studied in a prospective surveillance of adults in an acute-care hospital during the 1986-1987 influenza season, specifically searching for cases of nosocomial influenza. A total of 43 cases of influenza A were identified; 17 cases occurred among working hospital employees, 14 cases occurred among patients in the emergency room or clinics, ten were community-acquired cases among hospitalized patients, and two cases were nosocomially acquired. The nosocomial influenza attack rate was 0.3 per 100 hospital admissions. Both cases of nosocomial influenza were associated with secondary pneumonias and prolongation of hospital stay. These cases might have gone unrecognized in the absence of an influenza surveillance program. A potential reservoir of infection was the health care providers caring for the hospitalized patients. Further systematic influenza surveillance is needed to assess the global medical and economic impact of nosocomial influenza on hospitals, rather than simply relying on reports of institutional outbreaks.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between physical activity and bone mass was investigated in 24 healthy, white, premenopausal women (mean age [+/- SE], 39.0 +/- 1.39 years). Physical activity was determined by a sensor that measures movement of the trunk, and bone mineral levels were determined by means of single- and dual-photon absorptiometry and neutron activation analysis. Total physical activity levels were related both to bone mineral density of the spine (r = .41) and to total body calcium levels (r = .51). There was no significant relationship between the bone density of the distal portion of the radius and activity (r = .20). Nonparametric analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed negative correlations between cigarette smoking and bone density of the spine and radius. These data suggest that the level of physical activity in sedentary white women may be a determinant of peak total skeletal mass and bone density of the spine.\r"

  ".W": "To provide additional data on the smoking-breast cancer association, a case-control study of 456 cases of breast cancer and 1693 matched controls was conducted among participants in a cancer screening program. The adjusted risk of breast cancer for current smokers was 1.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.90). Analysis of smoking habits restricted to premenopausal women revealed a risk estimate of 2.33 (confidence interval, 1.10 to 4.96) among current smokers and increasing linear trends in risk for number of cigarettes smoked per day and for number of years of smoking. Although smokers had an earlier natural menopause than nonsmokers, there was no evidence of a protective effect of early menopause after adjustment for other factors. These findings suggest that smoking may increase the incidence of breast cancer, especially in premenopausal women.\r"

All patients displayed important neurobehavioral disturbances, including an acute confusional state, necessitating medical consultation. The composite group had minimal hypertension, significant arrhythmias in the young, and no history of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Unsuspected cases of idiopathic orthostatic hypotension, as well as cardiac arrhythmias in the elderly, were discovered. A vascular cause was not considered in 79% of those presenting for emergency evaluation and prevented proper acute diagnostic evaluation in 88%. Recognition of this potentially reversible cerebrovascular syndrome may prevent hazardous diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\r"

The clinical diagnostic error rate documented by autopsy studies ranges from 6% to 68%. We analyzed the clinical and autopsy records of 234 patients who died during a 14 1/2-year period at our chronic care institution to determine the accuracy of clinical cause of death in addition to the pathologic cause of death. The most common causes of death included bronchopneumonia (33%), congestive heart failure (15%), metastatic carcinoma (14%), pulmonary embolism (8%), myocardial infarction (7%), cerebrovascular accident (6%), unknown cause of death (8%), and a miscellaneous group (9%). The highest diagnostic error rate was in the underdiagnosis of pulmonary embolism (39% antemortem accuracy rate). The most accurately diagnosed condition was cerebrovascular accident (92% antemortem accuracy rate). Pneumonia was correctly diagnosed antemortem in 73% of the patients studied. These data suggest that serious and potentially treatable illnesses are underdiagnosed in the elderly institutionalized patient and that there is valuable information to be learned by performing autopsies in the elderly population.\r"

We report the unique temporal association of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal hemogloblnuria.\r"
