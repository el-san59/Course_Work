  ".W": "A mechanical microvascular anastomotic device, the Unilink system, was compared with sutures in terms of patency, anastomotic time, and histologic changes when a microvenous graft is placed in an arterial defect. Twenty rabbits underwent grafting of a 1.0-cm defect in both carotid arteries with a 1.5-cm reversed femoral vein graft. Anastomoses were performed with the Unilink system on one side and sutures on the other. Animals were killed at 2 weeks (10 animals) and 16 weeks (10 animals) with the vein grafts being assessed with clinical patency tests and then fixated for histologic evaluation. All 20 grafts (100%) interposed with the Unilink system were fully patent while 17 (85%) of the 20 grafts interposed with sutures were fully patent. The grafting procedure with the Unilink anastomoses averaged 12.5 minutes while the sutured anastomoses averaged 41.9 minutes. No differences in the histologic appearance of the vein grafts were noted between the two types of anastomoses. All grafts showed endothelialization at 2 weeks with intimal hyperplasia or \"arterialization\" being a constant finding.\r"

One method of assessing the extension is computed tomography (CT), but its reliability is still questionable. Therefore, the preoperative CT images were compared with the pathoanatomic features of the surgical specimens in 15 patients who underwent orbital exenteration as part of a procedure for paranasal sinus malignant neoplasm. Ophthalmic symptoms were present in eight patients and in each instance the CT images documented the extension of the tumor accurately. In only four of seven patients without ophthalmic symptoms did CT scanning appear to match the factual situation. Apparently CT scanning is not always reliable in patients without ophthalmic symptoms.\r"

Otherwise healthy, she recalled having recurrent bouts of croup until she was 15 years old, exercise limitation secondary to stridor, and a family history of nasal hypoplasia. Genetic referral diagnosed her condition as Opitz-BBB/G compound syndrome (oculogenitolaryngeal syndrome), and we here review its head and neck manifestations. Suspected agenesis of nasal cartilage, unreported in previous literature (to our knowledge), was confirmed intraoperatively and presented a unique challenge for reconstruction, including a restricted choice of anesthesia and a need for banked cartilage.\r"

In this study, the frequency of adverse events in 1013 patients receiving atracurium was substantially the same as that in 851 patients receiving other neuromuscular blocking agents. In both groups there were no instances of cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis or death, no adverse effects associated with failure to antagonize neuromuscular block, and no instances of previously unreported types of adverse effects. We conclude that the safety profile of atracurium is similar to that of other neuromuscular blocking agents and that this type of observational study of anaesthetic agents may prove a useful tool for surveillance of new drugs used primarily in hospitals.\r"

In one pregnant patient undergoing Caesarean section, MgSO4 was ineffective in controlling cardiovascular disturbances because of inadequate serum magnesium concentrations. This patient had a magnesium deficit before operation. In another patient, diagnosis was made during operation and MgSO4 provided satisfactory control of the crisis. Catecholamine release was studied in five patients and MgSO4 was found to reduce catecholamine concentrations from the time of induction until tumour handling.\r"

In view of their higher ED values compared with adults and a marked individual variability in response to small doses of suxamethonium, we recommend an intubating dose of 3 mg kg-1 for neonates and infants and 2 mg kg-1 for children.

Doxapram augmented neuromuscular transmission in a dose-related manner when a threshold concentration of 5 x 10(-5) mol litre-1 had been exceeded. The activity of the acetylcholinesterase in rat diaphragm has been examined also in the presence of doxapram. No inhibitory effect was seen in the concentration range which augmented neuromuscular transmission, thus excluding cholinesterase inhibition as the underlying mechanism. In contrast, in the presence of partial neuromuscular block, a dose-related depression of neuromuscular transmission with doxapram was revealed. This was greatest when the neuromuscular blocking agents possessed significant presynaptic activity (beta-bungarotoxin and tubocurarine). In this situation any facilitatory action of doxapram was severely reduced or abolished. In contrast, the facilitatory effects of doxapram were apparent in the presence of partial block produced by agents with less or no presynaptic activity (pancuronium and alpha-bungarotoxin). This study suggests that doxapram has a presynaptic facilitatory action at the neuromuscular junction. In the presence of partial neuromuscular block, an inhibitory action is revealed which may be post-junctional. The concentrations of doxapram at which these effects appear are approximately five times greater than those reached in plasma after a standard clinical dose.\r"

Halothane 2.8% decreased left ventricular pressure by 75.4 (SEM 4.4)% and decreased the calcium content by 30%. Enflurane 5.1% decreased the pressure by 72.4 (6.0)% and decreased calcium content by 31%. Both halothane and enflurane decreased the calcium content of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) as measured by caffeine-induced calcium release. There was a high degree of correlation between the negative inotropic effect of inhalation anaesthetics and the decrease in calcium content of the SR (r = 0.95 for halothane, r = 0.91 for enflurane). These data suggest that inhalation anaesthetics increase the calcium permeability of cardiac SR, thereby decreasing the calcium content of SR, resulting in the negative inotropic effect.\r"

Motility was measured by manometry and gastric emptying rate by the paracetamol absorption test. Anaesthesia reduced the duration of the interdigestive motility complexes with both analgesics (P less than 0.001), mainly by a shortening of phase II (P less than 0.01). The duration of phase II and III were shorter with pethidine, and pethidine reduced both the frequency and amplitudes of antral contractions during phase II (P less than 0.01). Fentanyl affected only the amplitudes. The phase III variables assessed were unchanged, apart from a decrease in the velocity of propagation of the motility complexes with pethidine (P less than 0.01). The gastric pH increased in both groups during and after operation (P less than 0.01). Gastric emptying rate was normal in 82% with fentanyl and in 60% with pethidine. Motility in the recovery period approached, but did not reach, preoperative values. Balanced anaesthesia with pethidine and fentanyl seem to have minor influence on gastroduodenal motility and gastric emptying rate.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of atracurium and its breakdown product, laudanosine, on resting and stimulation-evoked release of 3H-noradrenaline (3H-NA) from sympathetic axon terminals of isolated right atria of guinea pigs. Both atracurium 1-100 mumol litre-1 and laudanosine 1-50 mumol litre-1 enhanced the release of 3H-NA evoked by field stimulation (2 Hz, 24 stimuli), but did not affect resting release. When the production of laudanosine from atracurium was inhibited by maintaining the atracurium solution at 4 degrees C, atracurium did not enhance the release of 3H-NA as occurred when it was kept at 37 degrees C. However, atracurium antagonized the inhibitory effect of oxotremorine on release of 3H-NA, whereas laudanosine did not. These data suggest that atracurium possesses an antimuscarinic effect. Its metabolite, laudanosine, in concentrations which would be expected following prolonged administration of atracurium, produced a marked increase in release of 3H-NA. This effect of laudanosine may explain some of the unwanted effects seen following administration of atracurium.\r"

During operation unwinding of the adnexa was performed in all patients. Monitoring of the pregnancy before and after operation by ultrasonography was normal. The postoperative period and the rest of the pregnancy were uneventful. Three women were delivered normally at term. One patient was delivered by caesarean section because of twin pregnancy with malpresentation, and two pregnancies are still ongoing beyond the first trimester. This preliminary study suggests that detorsion of ischaemic-haemorrhagic adnexa during pregnancy is an option that is not associated with subsequent complications. This approach might be adopted relatively safely when preservation of future fertility is a goal.\r"

The excretion of 5-oxoproline/creatinine (mumol/mmol) rose progressively as pregnancy advanced (non-pregnant mean 10, SD 5, first trimester mean 46, SD 12, second trimester mean 150, SD 180, and third trimester mean 280, SD 320) and by the third trimester was over 20 times greater than in non-pregnant women.

Above the observed threshold, a significant linear correlation was found between cumulative salivary progesterone and the results of histological dating. Among 55 women, progesterone profile in the first half of the luteal phase, but not the second half, was found to be significantly lower in those with retarded endometrial development than in those with normal development. Overall, 50% of retarded endometrial development was associated with a subnormal progesterone profile, but the other 50% was associated with a normal progesterone profile, in keeping with an abnormal response of the endometrium due to progesterone receptor deficiency. Retarded endometrial development was more likely to be associated with a subnormal progesterone profile in the first half of the luteal phase than in the second half.\r"

The combination of an endocervical swab placed in Amies transport medium for gonococcal isolation and an endocervical slide for immunofluorescent detection of chlamydiae proved to be a simple and accurate method of screening for STD. As a result of contact tracing, 16 sexual partners of women in whom STD was detected were examined. Three cases of gonococcal and nine cases of non-gonococcal urethritis were diagnosed.

All had two cervical smears performed at a mean interval of 3 months. At the time of the second smear, cervicography, colposcopy and biopsy were performed. The area of acetowhite cervical lesions and of the total visible atypical transformation zone (ATZ) were measured from the cervical photographs. The 17 women in whom one or both smears showed no dyskaryosis were found to have a significantly smaller proportion of their ATZ affected by CIN. It is suggested that this finding can account for the sampling error which causes false-negative cervical cytology. New screening techniques, such as cervicography, may offer a method of detecting and assessing these relatively smaller cervical lesions.\r"

Adherent organisms were quantitated by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and viable counting. Bacterial adherence was associated with production of a polysaccharide glycocalyx. Organisms which were attached to the lenses were resistant to apparently bactericidal concentrations of antibiotics, as determined by conventional testing. We speculate on the role of colonisation in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis.\r"

Significant reductions were observed 4, 8, and 12 hours after application of 1.0, 2.5, or 10 micrograms PGF2 alpha equivalents of the drug. With 10 micrograms the effect lasted 24 hours. An initial tendency towards an increase in IOP was observed for these doses. Repeated doses of 1.0 microgram daily or 0.5 microgram twice daily produced a significant and lasting IOP reduction of about 2 mmHg for 1-2 weeks. Aqueous humour production was not altered, and outflow facility was not significantly changed. There was a dose dependent hyperaemia with a maximum within 2 hours after application. A foreign body sensation, some pain, and photophobia were noted with increasing doses. A slight miosis of 1 mm was seen in three of six eyes treated with 10 micrograms. No signs of intraocular inflammation were recorded, but a slight increase in penetration of fluorescein into the anterior chamber was observed after 16 days of treatment.\r"

There are no characteristic signs or symptoms in infancy, and early detection relies on screening of newborn babies. Nineteen patients with homocystinuria were studied; 14 received dietary treatment and vitamin supplementation starting in the newborn period. Of these, none developed ectopia lentis after a mean follow-up of 8.2 years, compared with a 70% dislocation rate in untreated patients with a similar follow-up period. Ectopia lentis developed and progressed in five patients diagnosed later in life, despite tight biochemical control. The risk of ocular complications in homocystinuria can be substantially reduced in patients started on treatment within six weeks of birth.\r"

The sensitivity losses in patients with macular degeneration have also been attributed to a loss of photoreceptors. To test these explanations for sensitivity loss we obtained electrophysiological and psychophysical temporal modulation transfer functions (MTFs) on normal subjects in response to varying stimulus luminances and retinal loci. These stimulus manipulations did not duplicate the changes observed in the temporal MTFs of patients. The temporal response properties of the receptors were tested electrophysiologically by manipulating stimulus presentation interval. The results provided evidence for sensitivity losses in RP patients being due to alterations in the temporal response properties of the receptors.\r"

It is notable that 48.1% of fellow eyes with no (known) history of acute pressure rise also showed some form of VEP abnormality. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms operating in both affected and fellow eyes are discussed. It is concluded that, despite the presence of possible artefactual influences, the results probably reflect the presence of primary angle closure glaucoma.\r"

The structure of the receptor for EP in these cells was determined to be proteins of 100 and 85 Kd by cross-linking 125I-EP. In this investigation, studies on the receptors for EP were extended to other mouse erythroid cells and human erythroid cells as well as to the placentas of mice and rats. Only lower affinity receptors for EP were detected on erythroblasts purified from the spleens of mice infected with the polycythemia strain of Friend virus and a murine erythroleukemia cell line, both of which are not responsive to EP in culture. Internalization of 125I-EP was observed in both groups of cells. The structure of the receptor determined by cross-linking 125I-EP was two equally labeled proteins of 100 Kd and 85 Kd molecular mass in all these mouse erythroid cells. The structure of the receptor was found to be very similar in human erythroid colony forming cells cultured from normal blood. These cells respond to EP with erythroid maturation and were previously shown to have high and lower affinity receptors. Placentas from mice and rats were found to have only lower affinity receptors for EP, and when placental membranes were cross-linked to 125I-EP, the same 100 Kd and 85 Kd bands were found as seen in mouse and human erythroid cells. The structure of the receptor was similar in cells that have high affinity receptors (FVA-infected and human erythroid colony-forming cells) and nonresponsive erythroid cells and placenta that have lower affinity receptors, but only the cells with the high affinity receptors respond to the addition of EP with erythroid maturation.\r"

  ".W": "The anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is associated with conditions in which macrophage activation occurs. Activated marrow macrophages suppress erythropoiesis in vitro and produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Therefore, we tested the effects of chronic in vivo exposure to TNF to determine if it was a candidate for a mediator of ACD. Nude mice were inoculated with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the human TNF gene or with control cells containing the transfection vector alone. The TNF mice promptly became reticulocytopenic, and after 3 weeks their corrected reticulocytes were 2.6% +/- 0.7% as compared with 7.3% +/- 4% in control mice. The hematocrit at 3 weeks was 28.4% +/- 1.7% in TNF mice as compared with 46% +/- 0.8% in control mice. This anemia was also associated with low serum iron and normal iron stores and increased erythropoietin (Epo) levels. The TNF mice showed an absolute monocytosis with twice the number of circulating monocytes as control mice and had M-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) activity in their serum. The TNF mice also became mildly thrombocytopenic. Marrow CFU-E and BFU-E were profoundly decreased (1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(3) v 8.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) CFU-E per femur, and 6.5 +/- 1 x 10(2) v 8.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) BFU-E per femur). Splenic CFU-E and BFU-E were similarly depressed. In contrast, marrow CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM were not affected. The residual BFU-E in TNF mice were relatively resistant to TNF as compared with control mice. These data demonstrate that TNF preferentially inhibits erythropoiesis in vivo and may be important in the pathogenesis of ACD.\r"

  ".W": "Azidothymidine (AZT) is a useful drug in management of AIDS. Nevertheless, its hematologic toxicity such as anemia and neutropenia present further complications to an already compromised hematopoietic state in patients. We studied the effects of AZT on human and murine bone marrow (BM) colony growth as determined by assays of CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-GM, and fibroblastoid stromal (CFU-Fb) colonies. Cultures were grown in methylcellulose with growth factors and scored after three- to 14-day incubation. In general, murine marrow cultures were more sensitive to AZT as compared with human marrow. Furthermore, interindividual variation in toxicity to AZT was observed between marrow samples; 1 mumol/L AZT inhibited murine CFU-E, BFU-E, and CFU-GM by 98% to 100%, whereas human marrow was inhibited by 52%, 87%, and 65%, respectively. Lower concentrations of AZT (0.1 mumol/L) inhibited murine erythroid colony growth by 85% to 90%, whereas human growth was inhibited by only 39% to 52%. Myeloid colony inhibition was similar for human and murine systems. CFU-Fb growth was markedly suppressed (75%) by 1 mumol/L AZT. Hemin, at a concentration of 10 mumol/L, overcame some of the inhibitory effects of 1 to 0.1 mumol/L AZT without hindering antiviral activity. Inhibition of human CFU-E growth was completely overcome with hemin, whereas CFU-GM growth was recovered to 66% to 74% of control. A similar but less pronounced effect was observed for BFU-E. Furthermore, hemin does not decrease AZT's effects of HIV antigen content in vitro. We conclude that anemia and neutropenia, occurring as a result of AZT, may not be as pronounced in the presence of hemin. Furthermore, CFU-Fb was significantly reduced in the presence of low concentrations of AZT. This may indicate a major target site for BM toxicity since the stromal microenvironment may be responsible for maintaining short- and long-term hematopoiesis.\r"

Processing and export of certain leukocyte and melanoma integrins is disrupted in cells lacking one subunit. We found that surface expression of GPIIb-IIIa, measured by fluorescent activated cell sorting or by surface labeling, required cotransfection of both subunits. In contrast, surface expression was not detected when the subunits were transfected individually. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled transfected cells confirmed the presence of comparable levels of intracellular protein in all cases. When both subunits were transfected, post-translational cleavage of Pro-GPIIb to yield GPIIb heavy chain was also seen, while transfection with GPIIb alone resulted in coprecipitation of Pro-GPIIb with a second band that may be an endogenous beta subunit. Pro-GPIIb in these transfectants was not processed to yield GPIIb heavy chain. When transfected into COS cells alone, transiently expressed GPIIIa remained intracellular and did not appear to complex with any endogenous proteins. Thus, surface expression of processed GPIIb-IIIa depends on the presence of both subunits; the coordinate reduction of both subunits observed in some cases of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia may result from mutation affecting only one.\r"

  ".W": "Amphotropic helper-free retroviral vectors containing either the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NEO) or a mutant dihydrofolate reductase gene (DHFR*) were used to infect canine hematopoietic progenitor cells. In previous experiments, successful transfer and expression of both genes in canine CFU-GM were achieved after 24-hour cocultivation with virus-producing cells. The average rate of gene expression was 10% (6% to 16%) as measured by the number of CFU-GM resistant to either the aminoglycoside G418 or methotrexate. In an attempt to increase the efficiency of gene transfer, marrow was cocultured for 24 hours with either NEO or DHFR* virus-producing packaging cells and then kept in long-term marrow culture fed three times with virus-containing supernatant (2 to 5 x 10(6) CFU/mL). After six days, cells were harvested and cultured in CFU-GM assay with and without a selective agent. The average rate of gene expression in CFU-GM in five independent experiments was 46% and ranged from 19% to 87%. In conclusion, the efficiency of gene transfer into canine hematopoietic progenitor cells has been increased fourfold by combining cocultivation with long-term marrow culture as compared with results obtained with cocultivation only.\r"

  ".U": "89323332\r", 
  ".W": "Several investigators have reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can alter the hemostatic properties of vascular endothelial cells in vitro. We have examined the in vivo effects on the hemostatic mechanism of recombinant human TNF administered as a continuous intravenous infusion to 23 cancer patients with active disease. A battery of sensitive and specific immunochemical techniques were used to monitor changes in blood coagulability. Serial determinations of F1 + 2, the protein C activation peptide (PCP), and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) were obtained prior to the initiation of the TNF infusions and at three and 24 hours after the start of therapy in 12 individuals who received greater than 3 x 10(5) U/m2/24h. The mean levels of F1 + 2, PCP, and FPA were significantly elevated at both time points as compared to the baseline values. The metabolic behavior of 125I-F1 + 2 in an animal model was not affected by infusions of the cytokine. We therefore conclude that the observed elevations in the concentration of this marker in humans receiving TNF result from hemostatic system hyperactivity. In 11 subjects infused with 1 x 10(5) to 2.4 x 10(5) U/m2/24 h of the cytokine, the mean levels of F1 + 2, PCP, and FPA were not significantly greater at 24 hours as compared with the baseline values, indicating that there is a threshold dose at which the cytokine can exert a biochemical effect on the coagulation system. Our studies demonstrate that TNF is able to provide a substantial net procoagulant stimulus to the hemostatic mechanism, and suggest that this cytokine may be a mediator of certain hypercoagulable states in humans.\r"

Seventeen (43%) of the 40 Rai stage 1 to 3 patients and four (19%) of the Rai stage 4 patients returned to Rai stage 0. Survival was strongly correlated with the final Rai stage achieved. The survival of the 11 partial responders with residual disease consisting only of residual bone-marrow nodules was similar to the complete responders (36+ months) and superior to the other partial response patients (16 months). The response to fludarabine was rapid, with 36 (92%) of the 39 responders having achieved at least a partial response following the first three courses. Complete responses occurred in the blood, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes in 48% to 69% of the patients. Eradication of all disease in the bone marrow occurred in only 13% of the cases. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 56% and 25% of evaluable courses. Major infections occurred in 9% of evaluable courses and fevers of unknown origin or minor infections in 12% of courses respectively. Myelosuppression and infection were more common in patients with initial Rai stages 3 and 4 and in nonresponding patients. Other toxicity was mild. No CNS toxicity was noted.\r"

  ".W": "Factor IX Chicago-2 and prothrombin Madrid were purified from patients with hemophilia B and congenital dysprothrombinemia, respectively. Each protein displays defects in zymogen activation secondary to the failure to cleave one of the sessile bonds whose cleavage is necessary for full coagulant activity. These proteins were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using conformation-specific antibodies directed at either factor IX or prothrombin. Factor IX Chicago-2 is cleaved abnormally by factor XIa, yielding a pattern consistent with the failure to cleave the sessile bond between Arg 145 and Ala 146. Prothrombin Madrid is cleaved abnormally by factor Xa, yielding a pattern consistent with the failure to cleave the sessile bond between Arg 271 and Thr 272. Peptide mapping was performed on reduced and alkylated factor IX, factor IX Chicago-2, prothrombin, and prothrombin Madrid, and the hydrolysates were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mutant peptide in factor IX Chicago-2 was identified by automated Edman degradation as residues 143 through 188 of factor IX, and had a histidine substituted for arginine at residue 145. The mutant peptide identified in prothrombin Madrid corresponds to residues 267 through 285 of prothrombin and has the substitution of cysteine for arginine at residue 271. These mutations, each occurring at arginines, are identical to those in factor IX Chapel Hill and prothrombin Barcelona. These results suggest that a limited repertoire of point mutations, many affecting arginine residues, may be responsible for hereditary defects of the vitamin K-dependent proteins in patients with normal antigen levels.\r"

The coefficient of variation of the assay was 6.3% for the same sample assayed on different days. The linear regression line for a plot of observed v expected values of mixtures of plasmas with different EPI levels was Y = 1.01X - 2.7%. Single samples from 21 healthy adults under 60 years of age varied between 74% and 159% of a pooled reference plasma. The plasma level of a given individual (eight subjects) did not vary on repeat sampling over weeks to months. EPI activity was significantly lower in plasma from umbilical cord blood (64.3% +/- 12.7%, n = 16) than in plasma from adults. Mean EPI activity in adults greater than or equal to 60 years of age was slightly but significantly higher (112% +/- 16.8%, n = 23) than in adults less than 60 years of age (97.2% +/- 19.0%, n = 21). EPI levels in the third trimester of pregnancy were slightly higher than in nonpregnant women. Plasma EPI levels fell slightly after surgical procedures that caused fibrinogen levels to rise, which suggests that EPI is not an acute phase reactant. Administration of 1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) did not alter plasma EPI levels. In two patients subjected to plasmapheresis and volume replacement with albumin and isotonic saline, plasma EPI levels returned to one-half of the levels before pheresis within about one day.\r"

We report the isolation and characterization of the coding region for canine F.IX cDNA. Canine F.IX possesses 86% identity at the amino-acid level with human F.IX. The leader peptide, Gla domain, EGF domains, and the carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chains show extensive sequence conservation between the canine and human. All Glu residues undergoing gamma-carboxylation in humans are conserved in canines. The complete coding sequence for canine F.IX has been determined, and the derived translation product has been analyzed. A similar approach should allow identification of the causative mutation in canine hemophilia B. Furthermore, this clone may prove a valuable resource in gene transfer experiments for this disease.\r"

In an effort to understand these phenomena, we have measured the binding of (3H)-heparin to resting and stimulated platelets. In platelet-rich plasma, a single class of saturable heparin binding sites was observed (apparent dissociation constant [kd] approximately 0.55 microgram/mL, R approximately 0.059 microgram/10(9) cells). In gel-filtered platelets, a similar class of sites was present but with a greater binding capacity (apparent kd approximately 0.56 microgram/mL, R approximately 0.44 microgram/10(9) cells). Gel-filtered platelets that had been stimulated with thrombin displayed two classes of binding sites: a high-affinity class (apparent kd1 approximately 1.1 microgram/mL, R1 approximately 0.39 microgram/10(9) cells) corresponding to that of the unstimulated cells, and a low-affinity class (apparent kd2 approximately 13 micrograms/mL, R2 approximately 2.2 micrograms/10(9) cells). Heparin binding was also increased in platelet-rich plasma when the cells had been stimulated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to release, but not when ADP caused primary aggregation without release. Binding was not dependent on extracellular calcium, nor was it reduced by monoclonal antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins Ia/IIa, Ib, IIb/IIIa, or IV. Because the apparent dissociation constant of the high-affinity sites (approximately 0.55 microgram/mL) falls in the range of heparin concentrations achieved clinically, these binding sites may be involved in the platelet dysfunction and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia associated with therapeutic heparin. The low-affinity, high-capacity class of sites, which appears after cell stimulation, may participate in the process of platelet adhesion.\r"

She had no other signs of mucocutaneous bleeding. Coagulation studies revealed a markedly prolonged thrombin time (greater than 600 seconds), a slightly prolonged reptilase time (20 seconds), and mildly elevated fibrinogen (4.39 g/L), and fibrin D-dimer (200 to 500 ng/mL) levels. Treatment of the patient's plasma in vitro with protamine or barium sulfate normalized the thrombin time. The anticoagulant activity corresponded to 0.15 heparin U/mL when measured by a thrombin time assay using normal plasma as substrate and standardized with porcine heparin. The anticoagulant was quantitatively bound to and subsequently eluted with 1 mol/L NaCl from quaternary aminoethyl (QAE) Sephadex, and then isolated by affinity chromatography on immobilized antithrombin III. The isolated anticoagulant was shown to be sensitive to heparinase digestion. Therefore, the inhibitor has functional and chemical properties similar to those of high-affinity heparin. Thus far, this is the only anticoagulant of this type isolated from the plasma of a patient bearing a tumor other than plasma cell myeloma.\r"

Giant granules of mast cells were found in a mutant trait that occurred in the inbred colony of the DA strain rat maintained in Hamamatsu University School of Medicine. Giant granules were also observed in neutrophils and pigment cells of the eye. In this mutant, either spontaneous migration or chemotaxis of neutrophils was impaired, and the bleeding time was prolonged. Blood serotonin level of the mutant was about one tenth that of the normal congenic rat, and injection of serotonin normalized the bleeding time of the mutant. Moreover, the natural killer activity of the mutant was significantly impaired. These results indicated that this mutation was comparable to CHS of humans and mice, and we designated it as \"beige.\" Since rats are more favorable than mice for some types of experiments, the beige rat is potentially useful as an animal model of CHS.\r"

Thirteen neutral GSL bands were detected at Rf.03 through .64 (CHCl3-CH3OH-H2O, 65:25:4) after extraction and chromatography (DEAE-Sephadex and Bio-sil A). Both IgM and IgG serum antibody binding was determined for 50 subjects from four groups: normal blood donors (NBD, n = 18); leukemia patients with nonimmune thrombocytopenia (NIT, n = 10); patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 10); and patients with chronic autoimmune thrombocytopenia (CATP, n = 12). The ABO typing of these 50 subjects also allowed correlation of serum antibody binding with A blood group antigen expression. These studies reveal: (1) anti-GSL binding at band .06 is associated with blood group A alloantigen expression for both IgG and IgM (P less than .0001) antibodies; (2) binding at bands .17, .27, and/or .46 is associated with general autoimmunity (SLE and CATP) for IgM (P less than .0001); (3) binding at bands .35 and/or .38 is associated with platelet-specific autoimmunity (CATP) for IgG and/or IgM (P less than .005); and (4) binding at bands .03, .20, .23, and/or .43 is frequently observed for sera from all groups. The platelet specificity of bands .35 and .38 was confirmed by comparative studies with human intestinal smooth muscle GSLs. Quantitation of the intensity of CATP-associated anti-GSL binding (86 +/- 88 mm2) is comparable to anti-A alloantigen binding (57 +/- 52 mm2). Two of the GSL bands associated with SLE and CATP appear to be the long-chain fatty-acyl forms of globotriaosyl ceramide (.27) and globotetraosyl ceramide (.17), which are the Pk and P blood group antigens, respectively. These studies indicate that neutral GSLs may be important antigens in both autoimmune and alloimmune processes involving the blood platelet.\r"

Preliminary reports of a temporal relationship between administration of these drugs to viral carriers and development of AIDS raised the possibility that they can modify the course of HIV infection. Because glucocorticoids can alter specific gene expression in at least one immunosuppressive murine retrovirus, mammary tumor virus, we explored the ability of dexamethasone (DXM) to upregulate chronic HIV replication or to alter transcription at the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). A clone of promonocytic cells chronically infected with HIV-1 could be converted to a productive state of replication by phorbol ester or halogenated pyrimidine exposure, yet was unperturbed by DXM used over broad concentrations (10(-4) to 10(-9) mol/L) and time intervals (24 to 96 hours). This unresponsiveness corresponded to the lack of a positive effect of DXM on HIV associated trans-activation in both monocytic and CD4+ T cells. These cells possessed the appropriate steroid receptors, as DXM downregulated Fc gamma type-I receptors in both normal and HIV-infected promonocytic cells. In addition, DXM could block the transcriptional enhancement of an HIV-LTR-linked reporter gene by phorbol ester, while leaving basal levels of HIV-LTR-directed transcription unperturbed. These data are discussed in the context of clinical reviews of short-term steroid use in HIV-infected individuals.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of effect of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in immune cytopenias is incompletely known. One of the leading theories ascribes the short-term effects of IVIG to the competition of infused IVIG for Fc receptors, thereby inhibiting IgG-mediated clearance. Using a system independent of IgG-Fc receptor interactions, we examined another potential mechanism of IVIG action. Guinea pigs were infused with a human IVIG preparation at 600 mg/kg/day for two consecutive days. Parallel groups of animals were treated with the same volume and/or concentration of saline and albumin. Clearance of IgM-sensitized guinea pig erythrocytes, which is wholly complement dependent, was significantly retarded in animals treated with high-dose IVIG. The effect was specific for IVIG, since human albumin (as a second foreign protein) failed to change the clearance of IgM-sensitized guinea pig erythrocytes. Experiments in which IVIG-treated animals were subjected to pre- and posttreatment clearance studies revealed heterogeneity among individual animals in respect to their response to IVIG infusions. Decrease of available plasma complement components did not account for the effect, since both C3 and CH50 values remained unchanged after IVIG treatment, despite rising levels of IVIG in sera of treated animals. The results of in vitro C3 uptake studies and the effect of IVIG on clearance of preopsonized cells suggest that IVIG produces a kinetic depression of C3 uptake and modifies the process of complement fragment deposition on erythrocytes. A generalized effect on mononuclear phagocytes is less likely but cannot be wholly ruled out. These studies establish another potential mechanism of IVIG action and suggest extension of its use to other complement-mediated diseases.\r"

Immunocompromised patients, who were seropositive for HTLV-I, may be at increased risk for ATL compared to healthy carriers of HTLV-I, and the latent period may be shorter.\r"

  ".W": "Therapy planning in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) is complicated by its high prognostic heterogeneity. Forty-one patient and disease characteristics at onset of 370 patients with MDS were analyzed to identify significant prognostic factors for survival and transformation to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and to develop and validate a regression model for predicting survival. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the total bone marrow percentage of blast cells, age, platelet count, WBC count, and hemoglobin level were the characteristics more significantly associated with survival in the overall series. The bone marrow percentage of type I blast cells was the most important factor predicting transformation into AML. Proportional hazards regression analysis in a randomly selected training sample of 240 patients demonstrated that the combination of total bone marrow percentage of blast cells, platelet count, and age had the strongest predictive relation to survival length. The resulting regression models, continuous and categorized, were validated in the remaining test sample of 130 patients by demonstrating its capability of segregating patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, with distinctively different survival curves (P less than .0001). A scoring system derived from the categorized model also had a great prognostic value (P less than .0001). These regression models and the simpler scoring system may be accurately used for decision-making regarding therapy in MDS patients.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the frequency and significance of nonrandom abnormalities of chromosome 9p in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we analyzed our experience with 398 consecutive cases with completely banded karyotypes. Forty cases (10%) with abnormalities of 9p were identified: 26 with deletions, nine with unbalanced translocations resulting in the loss of 9p material, and five with apparently balanced reciprocal translocations. As compared with children with ALL lacking 9p abnormalities, these 40 cases were significantly older, had higher initial circulating WBC counts, more \"lymphomatous\" disease characteristics (including presence of a mediastinal mass in 15%. T-cell phenotype in 26%, splenomegaly greater than 8 cm in 25%), an increased failure rate in the first 2 to 3 years after diagnosis, and a higher incidence of extramedullary relapse. Conversely, lymphomatous ALL cases were twice as likely (19% v 8%) to have an abnormality of chromosome 9p than ALL cases lacking lymphomatous features (P = .01). The finding of an abnormal chromosome 9p, however, was not specific for lymphomatous ALL or T-cell lineage, because most cases were neither lymphomatous nor T-cell, and the overall Kaplan-Meier distribution of treatment failures for abnormal 9p cases was not statistically significantly different from control ALL cases receiving the same treatment who lacked abnormalities of 9p (P = .06, by log-rank test). We conclude that nonrandom abnormalities of chromosome 9p, especially a breakpoint in 9p21-22, occur with increased frequency in childhood ALL in association with some high-risk clinical features. Despite this association, the chromosome anomaly is nonspecific in its syndrome delineation and confers no major adverse consequence on long-term survival of childhood ALL treated with modern therapy. However, due to an apparently increased hazard of involvement of the CNS (eight of 17 failures), it may be inadvisable to lessen the intensity of CNS preventive therapy for this group of patients.\r"

  ".U": "89323369\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated whether an indirect nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) immunofluorescence (IF) assay on single cells present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is more effective than conventional cytomorphology for early detection or exclusion of (minimal) meningeal leukemic infiltration in patients with a TdT+ malignancy. During a 5-year follow-up study, 1,661 consecutive CSF samples from 113 children with a TdT+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 100), a TdT+ acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) (n = 8), or a TdT+ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (n = 5) were analyzed. In 1,511 (91.9%) of 1,643 evaluable CSF samples, the positive and negative findings of both cytomorphology and the TdT-IF assay were concordant. In 47 (2.9%) samples from 28 patients, the cytomorphology was suspect while the TdT-IF assay was negative; follow-up as long as 58 months revealed no CNS leukemia in any patient. In 85 (5.2%) samples, cytomorphology was negative (n = 70) or suspect (n = 15) but TdT+ cells were detected. RBC contamination seriously hampered evaluation in 31 of these 85 samples. From the remaining 54 TdT+ samples from 29 patients, 40 samples preceded overt CNS leukemia in 20 patients. Two consecutive findings of TdT+ cells in the CSF were always followed by overt CNS leukemia. At initial diagnosis, 11 children had TdT+ cells in their RBC-free CSF. In one of these children, morphology was suspect; a repeated lumbar puncture was positive on both assays. Thus, initial CNS leukemia was diagnosed. In the other ten children, morphology was negative. In six of them, CNS leukemia was diagnosed 2 to 20 months later. In 32 other children examined at initial diagnosis, neither TdT+ cells nor blasts were observed in the CSF. In none of these patients was a CNS leukemia diagnosed after a follow-up of 2.5 to 57 months (median 24 months). In 207 control CSF samples from 58 children with TdT- oncologic, hematologic, or infectious diseases, no TdT+ cells could be detected. The TdT-IF assay is easy to perform and is a more reliable diagnostic tool for detection of CNS leukemia at an early stage than is cytomorphology. At initial diagnosis, the finding of Tdt+ cells in a RBC-free CSF sample with a negative cytomorphology is highly predictive for development of overt CNS leukemia.\r"

This study examined expression of other phosphatidylinositol (PI)-anchored proteins by Inab erythrocytes and showed that the PI-linked membrane proteins acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3) are normally expressed by these cells. Furthermore, studies of the complement sensitivity of Inab RBCs demonstrated them to be abnormally complement sensitive, with an apparent defect in downregulation of C3 convertase activity. Thus, the Inab phenotype appears to represent an instance of hereditary erythrocyte DAF deficiency whose mechanism differs from that of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and which is unassociated with clinically evident hemolytic disease.\r"

The two parameters most often used to characterize the state of cell hydration are (a) the complete cell density distribution profile, and (b) the fraction of cells with densities greater than a defined value. Buoyant density cell fractionation with a variety of polymers has long been the preferred method for obtaining data on cell density distribution. Although this method provides accurate and quantitative information on the state of RBC hydration, its applicability has been limited due to the time-consuming experimental procedure involved in generating the data. A recently developed light-scattering method has been used in the present study to quantitate RBC density distribution. This new method accurately quantitates both the cell density distribution profile and the fraction of dense, dehydrated cells in various RBC disorders. The ability of the automated method to generate this information rapidly makes possible objective testing of different hypotheses concerning the contributions of cell hydration and dehydration to the pathophysiology of various RBC disorders.\r"

RNase mapping demonstrated that the amount of ADA mRNA in affected reticulocytes was greater than the amount in normal B lymphoblasts, whereas ADA mRNA was undetectable in normal reticulocytes. The 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of reticulocyte and B-lymphoblast ADA mRNAs from affected individuals were structurally indistinguishable from those of normal B lymphoblasts. Northern blot analysis performed under stringent hybridization and washing conditions confirmed a markedly increased amount of reticulocyte ADA mRNA in affected individuals as compared with controls. We conclude that the RBC-specific overexpression of ADA in this disorder occurs at the mRNA level.\r"

Because butyrate and alpha-amino-n-butyric acid (ABA) augment gamma globin expression in normal neonatal and adult erythroid progenitors, we investigated the effects of sodium butyrate and ABA on erythroid progenitors of patients with beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia who might benefit from such an effect. Both substances increased fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) expression in Bfu-e from 7% to 30% above levels found in control cultures from the same subjects with sickle cell anemia. The fraction of cultured erythroblasts producing Hb F increased more than 20% with sodium butyrate treatment in 70% of cultures. In most cultures, this produced greater than 20% total Hb F and greater than 70% F cells, levels which have been considered beneficial in ameliorating clinical symptoms. Alpha: non-alpha (alpha-non-alpha) imbalance was decreased by 36% in erythroid progenitors of patients with beta thalassemia cultured in the presence of butyrate compared with control cultures from the same subjects. These data suggest that sodium butyrate may have therapeutic potential for increasing gamma globin expression in the beta globin diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of reticulocyte maturation have been limited by the inability to obtain pure populations of age-synchronized reticulocytes and by the absence of well-defined methods for the maturation of reticulocytes in vitro. Many of these problems were overcome using temporary suppression of erythropoiesis with thiamphenicol and phlebotomy resulting in a highly reproducible reticulocyte response, Percoll density gradient separation of cells yielding essentially pure populations of age-synchronized reticulocytes, and liquid culture techniques where cell lysis is minimal. The system allows reproducible study of well-defined cohorts of reticulocytes as they mature into erythrocytes. During in vitro maturation we serially monitored changes in reticulocyte count, glucose consumption, 125I-transferrin binding, fluorescein (FITC)-labeled transferrin binding, the activities of four erythrocyte enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase) and the appearance of cells on scanning electron microscopy. These variables changed at different rates suggesting that multiple mechanisms underlie these maturational events. Transferrin binding and reticulocyte count decreased most rapidly and reached values near zero after three to four days in culture. The four enzyme activities decreased much more slowly, and only two reached pretreatment values after seven days in culture. In contrast to the findings of others, scanning electron microscopy suggested that cells do not assume the normal biconcave shape in this system. The methods described make it feasible to study the process of reticulocyte maturation in vitro. The data presented represent a first step in the study of the coordination and interrelationships of various maturational processes.\r"

This mouse line (Hp) transcribes the transferrin gene in liver at the same rate observed in normal mice, but the steady state levels of transferrin mRNA sequences are less than 20% of normal. Further hybridization studies reveal that most of the transferrin mRNA sequences present in homozygous Hp mouse liver are in the form of a 5 kb nuclear precursor instead of the mature 2.5 kb transferrin mRNA seen in normal mice. Using several different exon and intron probes from the mouse transferrin gene, we have shown that the 5 kb RNA precursor retains the last two introns of the transferrin gene but that the 5' and middle introns have been removed by processing. The defect in transferrin mRNA processing also extends to nonhepatic tissues and we find the same lack of mature mRNA and increased precursor accumulation in brain RNA. Since Southern blot analysis does not reveal gross changes in the structure of the transferrin gene in Hp mice, we suggest that the Hp defect is due to a small deletion or point mutation that either disrupts splicing signals or uncovers cryptic splice signals that interfere with processing of the last two introns in the transferrin gene. This Hp mouse line provides an opportunity to study the effects of transferrin deficiency on development and iron homeostasis.\r"

We report that carbon monoxide-treated SS cells become progressively denser when incubated for eight to 12 hours in media with pH less than 7.40 (7.3 to 7.0) at constant cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG). This phenomenon is maximal in fresh SS cells from the top and middle density fractions, and is absent in cells from the densest fraction. When AA cells are separated according to density, acid pH induces cell shrinkage in the least dense fraction of AA cells, which has considerable KCl cotransport, but produces no change in cell density in the densest fractions of AA erythrocyte, which have no KCl cotransport. These data suggest that dense cells can form in oxygenated SS erythrocytes when the KCl cotransport system is activated by acidification.\r"

To test different treatments, we used a rat model of chronic GVHD which clinically, histologically, and immunologically resembles the disease occurring after human marrow transplant. The following treatments were administered: azathioprine 50 mg/kg/day plus prednisone 1 mg/kg/every other day; Cyclosporine (CsA) 30 mg/kg/day; CsA 30 mg/kg/day plus prednisone 1 mg/kg/every other day; thalidomide 50 mg/kg/day; thalidomide 10 mg/kg/day; CsA 10 mg/kg/day; and thalidomide 10 mg/kg/day plus CsA 10 mg/kg/day. All drugs were administered by gavage. Half of the animals (six of 12) treated with azathioprine plus prednisone every other day responded to treatment. The majority of animals (seven of 12) treated with CsA died early. The addition of prednisone every other day did not improve survival. The surviving animals treated with CsA (with or without prednisone) responded to treatment. Half of the animals treated with each of the above regimens had recurrent or progressive disease after therapy was discontinued. Thalidomide treatment was successful in the majority of animals (16 of 18). The addition of low-dose CsA to low-dose thalidomide resulted in a faster rate of response (12.1 +/- 1.8 v 28.2 +/- 1.6 days). We conclude that both thalidomide and thalidomide plus CsA appear promising in this model as treatment for chronic GVHD.\r"

We have developed a psoralen photochemical system for decontamination of platelet concentrates in which platelets are treated with long wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVA, 320-400 nm) in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP). Bacteria, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses ranging in genome size from 1.2 x 10(6) daltons, encompassing the size range of human pathogens, were inoculated into platelet concentrates and subjected to treatment. This system inactivated 25 to 30 logs/h of bacteria Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, 6 logs/h of bacteriophage fd, 0.9 log/h of bacteriophage R17 and 1.1 logs/h of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in platelet concentrates maintained in standard storage bags. Platelet integrity and in vitro function before, immediately following photochemical treatment, and during prolonged storage after treatment, were evaluated by measuring: (1) extracellular pH; (2) platelet yields; (3) extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels; (4) platelet morphology; (5) platelet aggregation responsiveness; (6) thromboxane beta-2 (TXB-2) production; (7) dense body secretion; and (8) alpha granule secretion. These assays demonstrated that this photochemical inactivation system inactivated bacteria and viruses in platelet concentrates with minimal adverse effects on the in vitro function of platelets in comparison to untreated control concentrates maintained under current, standard blood bank conditions.\r"

The scraped and irradiated CEMs were then reimplanted IP or subcutaneously (SC) for periods of 1 to 6 months in secondary syngeneic murine hosts. They were then removed for histologic study. CEMs reimplanted in SC sites developed bone and hematopoiesis as early as 1 month after implantation. Maximum hematopoiesis and bone formation was observed after 3 months. CEMs coated during the initial implantation with bone-derived stromal cells contained more bone and hematopoietic cells than did CEMs coated with marrow-derived stromal cells after SC implementation. Neither the CEMs coated with bone stromal cells nor those coated with marrow stromal cells developed new bone or trilineal hematopoiesis after being implanted IP. A few CEMs contained small foci of granulopoiesis only. We conclude that noncellular matrix substances deposited on CEMs by bone, and to a lesser degree by marrow cells, can induce prestromal cells in the SC tissues to produce a microenvironment suitable for trilineal hematopoiesis.\r"

Relative sizes of megakaryocytes, and their nuclei and cytoplasm, were measured microscopically in bone marrow smears, and the ploidy of the same cells was measured by two-wavelength microspectrophotometry. Maturation rate of megakaryocytes was estimated after they were labeled with tritiated thymidine. W/Wv megakaryocytes were macrocytic: average cell size was increased in each ploidy group. The increase in cytoplasmic area exceeded that of the nucleus. Further analysis of the predominant 16N ploidy group revealed that the increase in average cell size was due to depletion of cells of small size. Megakaryocytes matured more rapidly than normal in W/Wv mice. These results showed that megakaryocyte size and ploidy can be regulated separately. They suggest that alterations in cell growth and maturation may be mechanisms by which the organism can compensate for a deficiency in numbers of megakaryocytes, but they do not define the mechanism by which the deficiency may be sensed or by which the compensatory changes may be mediated. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.\r"

RAR alpha was expressed in all 12 cell lines and in all fresh leukemia samples as two major transcripts of 2.6 and 3.5 kb in size. Levels of RAR alpha expression and transcript sizes in retinoid-sensitive cells (such as HL60 or fresh promyelocytic leukemia cells) were not different from those in other samples. Moreover, expression of RAR alpha was not significantly modulated by exposure to cis-retinoic acid (cisRA) in either cisRA-responsive or unresponsive cells. By using a 3' fragment of the RAR alpha gene as a probe, we confirmed that the transcripts visualized did not represent the homologous RAR beta gene. RAR alpha appears to be expressed in most human leukemia cells regardless of the type of biologic response to retinoic acid.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and fifty previously untreated adult patients with diffuse large-cell lymphomas were treated with a chemotherapy combination of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone, and low-dose bleomycin (CHOP-Bleo) with or without radiotherapy between 1974 and 1984. The 10-year survival rates for patients with Ann Arbor stages II, III, or IV disease of 55%, 42%, and 40%, respectively, were not significantly different. However, the survival rate of 76% for patients with stage I disease was clearly better. Factors more indicative of prognosis than stage, as found by univariant analysis, were tumor burden, serum lactic dehydrogenase level (LDH), age, and constitutional symptoms. From these, a multivariant analysis selected tumor burden, LDH level, and age as major independent factors for predicting survival (P less than .001). A prognostic risk model constructed on the basis of tumor burden and LDH levels identified four distinct risk groups (A, B, C, D) with 10-year survival rates of 85%, 66%, and 43% for A, B, and C. No patient in group D survived 10 years. These risk groups also had a strong correlation with complete remission rates and with relapse rates. Thus this model proved more effective for identifying patient populations according to their expected responses, durations of remission, and survivals than the Ann Arbor staging system. Detailed information supporting the use of this system for predicting prognosis and for treatment selection for patients with diffuse large-cell lymphomas is provided.\r"

  ".W": "Four prognostic models described for aggressive malignant lymphomas and the classical Ann Arbor staging system were used to compare the survival of 737 patients treated with the LNH-84 regimen. The aim of the study was to determine the optimal prognostic system at the time of diagnosis. Three institutions have described these models after multivariate analyses: the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI1 and DFCI2), the MD Anderson Hospital (MDAH), and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). The models were constructed with the following variables: performance status, LDH level, and tumor extension. The latter is the most difficult to assess: it was considered as the number of extranodal sites and the diameter of the largest mass in DFCI1, stage and the diameter of the largest mass in DFCI2, the number of extranodal and extensive nodal sites in MDAH, and the number of nodal sites and their localization in MSKCC. Univariate studies with LNH-84 regimen patients showed all these variables to have major prognostic significance (logrank tests: P less than 10(-4)). All five prognostic systems divided patients into three subgroups: good, intermediate, and poor prognosis. Logrank analyses of survival showed highly significant differences (X2 greater than 90 and P less than 10(-6)) between the subgroups. No gross difference was found between the models, and none was better than the others. A new, internationally accepted prognostic system for the expression and comparison of treatment results in aggressive malignant lymphomas should include major univariate prognostic parameters and must be reliable and easy to use in clinical practice. Until such time, stage or LDH level are the best alternatives.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative cell lines were raised from bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), or lymph node samples of patients with intermediate- or high-grade malignant lymphoma. The cell lines were propagated in liquid suspension culture. They contain clonogenic progenitors capable of forming lymphoma colonies in semi-solid culture medium. Cells of these lines were used to examine the growth factor requirements of their clonogenic progenitors and to assess their ability to produce their own growth factors. Two of the cell lines (OCI-Ly9 and OCI-Ly13.1) required addition of exogenous factors for colony growth. These factors were routinely provided by media conditioned by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocytes (PHA-LCM). Three lines formed some and nine lines gave rise to optimal numbers of colonies without addition of growth factors. Eight of these factor-independent lines were able to function as feeder cells and promoted colony formation by both factor-dependent lines. Cell lines that displayed feeder cell function released activities into supernatants able to replace their cellular source. Some of these endogenously produced growth-promoting activities could be replaced by known hematopoietic growth factors. Both factor-dependent cell lines were cultured with recombinant IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, and GM colony-stimulating factor (CSF) and semipurified B-cell growth factor (BCGF) interleukin-4 (IL-4). A heterogeneous response pattern was observed. Both lines formed colonies with IL-4. The colonies were comparable in frequency and size with colonies observed with (PHA-LCM). OCI-Ly9 responded to IL-6 but showed no growth with IL-2. In contrast, the TAC-positive line OCI-Ly13.1 gave rise to colonies with IL-2 while remaining unresponsive to IL-6. A moderate number of colonies was observed when cells of this line were cultured with GM-CSF. Colony formation of both lines was uninfluenced by IL1 alpha or IL-3.\r"

Analysis was performed on unfractionated minimally manipulated marrows obtained from routine bone marrow aspirates. MKs were labeled with a fluorescent lineage-specific monoclonal antibody to the GPIIb/IIIa complex followed by DNA staining with propidium iodide. Eight hundred to 3,000 MKs were analyzed in each sample. The modal ploidy distribution in normals was 16N, comprising about half of the megakaryocytic population, with 22.6% of the cells less than or equal to 8N and 22.0% greater than or equal to 32N. Twelve thrombocytopenic patients with decreased marrow MKs on biopsy (mean platelet count [MPC] 44,600/microliters) showed an increase in low ploidy cells with 53.2% less than or equal to 8N (P less than .01); cell size was reduced in three patients when compared to normal cells of identical ploidy (P less than .05). Eight thrombocytopenic patients with enhanced platelet destruction (with normal or increased MKs on biopsy and shortened platelet survival; MPC 41,400/microliters) showed an increased proportion of high ploidy cells greater than or equal to 32N to 39.2% (P less than .01). Increased cell size and granularity were found in four of these patients (P less than .05). Six patients with thrombocytopenia secondary to multiple mechanisms affecting both platelet production and destruction (MPC 66,700/microliters) showed no shift in ploidy. Four patients with primary thrombocytosis (two with thrombocythemia and two with polycythemia vera; MPC 822,500/microliters) showed a marked shift toward high ploidy cells with 42.3% greater than or equal to 32N and 7.6% greater than or equal to 64N cells (P less than .01). The shift was accompanied by a marked increase in cell size and granularity in the patients with thrombocythemia. Ten patients with thrombocytosis secondary to chronic blood loss, malignant or inflammatory disorders (MPC 714,000/microliters), showed variable distributions with four patients exhibiting a shift in ploidy to the right similar to that found in the patients with increased platelet destruction. Based upon the present data, flow cytometric ploidy distribution may be diagnostically useful in thrombocytopenic patients by discriminating between disorders of platelet production and destruction.

HL60 cells were shown to release to their growth medium a Tf-binding protein which could be immunoprecipitated by anti-Tf receptor monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) B3/25 and OKT9. Soluble Tf receptor was detected in the medium within one hour of replating of cells, and its release was inhibited at 4 degrees C. The affinity of Tf for the soluble receptor released by cells (kd = 2.3 x 10(-10) mol/L) was slightly lower than its affinity for the detergent-solubilized cellular receptor (kd = 1.2 x 10(-10) mol/L). 125I-Tf internalized and released by cells subsequently bound to Tf receptor released by the same cells, and soluble Tf receptor in the conditioned medium (CM) inhibited 125I-Tf binding to intact cells. The soluble Tf receptor isolated from the CM was smaller (78,000 daltons) than the cell surface receptor (94,000 daltons) when analyzed by gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Isolated cell membranes readily released soluble receptor; however, this release could be blocked by protease inhibitors. The soluble Tf receptor may represent the extracytoplasmic domain of the cellular Tf receptor released from the surface of HL60 cells through proteolytic cleavage by a membrane-based protease.\r"

  ".W": "We recently reported the development of several monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to native human erythropoietin (Ep). In the present study we have used the two antibodies with highest affinity to develop a two-sided or sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure Ep in human serum. In this assay Ep is incubated in microtiter wells precoated with the first (IgE) anti-Ep antibody. Assay wells are then incubated with the second (IgG1) anti-Ep antibody, which is labeled noncovalently with the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP) by means of bispecific tetrameric antibody complexes consisting of IgG1 anti-Ep cross-linked to IgG1 anti-AP using rat MoAbs specific for mouse IgG1. Application of this noncovalent labeling procedure, in combination with substrate amplification, results in a detection sensitivity of 0.5 to 1.0 mU/sample (5 to 10 mU/mL), which makes this assay suitable for measuring normal serum Ep levels. The validity of this ELISA for quantitating Ep in biological fluids was demonstrated by the parallelism obtained between pure recombinant Ep dose-response curves and those obtained with plasma and serum from healthy donors and patients with various hematologic disorders. Normal plasma Ep levels detected with this ELISA ranged from 9 to 101 mU/mL with a mean of 32 +/- 23 (SD) mU/mL. Ep levels in sera from patients with polycythemia vera were in the low to normal range, whereas Ep levels in sera from patients with secondary polycythemia and patients with aplastic anemia were moderately to strongly elevated. These results demonstrate that the Ep-ELISA is a sensitive, reliable, and nonradioactive immunologic method for quantitating Ep levels and should prove useful in a variety of clinical and laboratory settings.\r"

  ".W": "The theta globin gene is the most recently discovered member of the alpha globin gene family. Its pattern of expression during development is not fully defined, and its encoded protein has not yet been detected in vivo. The detection of theta globin messenger RNA (mRNA) in embryonic and fetal erythroid tissue but not in adults has suggested that theta is an embryonic globin gene. The present study further defines the pattern of theta globin gene expression. We use a modification of the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to assess the levels of theta globin gene expression during development. We confirm the presence of the theta globin mRNA in embryonic and fetal erythroid tissue, and, in addition, we find theta mRNA in the peripheral reticulocytes of normal adults. Furthermore, using the same analytic approach, we detect low but significant levels of the embryonic zeta and epsilon mRNAs in reticulocytes of normal adults. Both zeta and theta gene expression appears erythroid specific in that neither mRNA species is detected in RNA isolated from brain tissue, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or three nonerythroid cell lines (B-lymphocyte, T-lymphocyte, and hepatoma cell lines). The relative levels of zeta and theta gene expression were assayed during development by a coamplification technique. The results demonstrate the expected developmental regulation of zeta globin mRNA. In contrast, the level of theta globin mRNA fails to demonstrate the significant changes of the magnitude seen in other globin genes and remains low in embryonic, fetal, and adult life. The lack of zeta and epsilon globin proteins in normal adults using highly sensitive immunologic techniques, as reported by others, stands in contrast to these mRNA results and suggests a gap between mRNA and protein expression.\r"

  ".W": "In situ hybridization was used to quantitate the cells that produce erythropoietin (EP) in the renal cortices of mice with varying severities of acute anemia and of mice recovering from severe, acute anemia. The number of EP-producing cells in the renal cortex increased in an exponential manner as hematocrit was decreased. Individual EP-producing cells had very similar densities of silver grains in autoradiograms regardless of whether they were from normal mice or from slightly, moderately or severely anemic animals. With increasingly severe anemia, total renal EP mRNA levels and serum EP concentrations showed increases that correlated with the number of renal EP-producing cells. These results indicate that as mice become more anemic, additional cells are recruited to produce EP rather than the cells already producing EP being stimulated to increase their individual production. In mildly and moderately anemic animals, small clusters of EP-producing cells were found in the inner cortex with large areas of cortex containing no EP-producing cells. In severely anemic mice, EP-producing cells were found throughout the inner cortex with only a very few found scattered in the outer cortex and outer medulla. The data indicate that only a subset of total renal interstitial cells produce EP. During recovery from severe, acute anemia, the numbers of EP-producing cells decreased exponentially as hematocrits rose and correlated with decreases in total renal EP mRNA and serum EP concentrations. These results suggest that following an acute blood loss and during the recovery from a blood loss, the capacity to deliver oxygen, as represented by hematocrit, is the major regulator of EP production.\r"

Expression, as mediated by infection with a recombinant baculovirus, was accomplished in suspension culture using reduced levels of serum and media supplements experimentally determined to provide optimum levels of factor production (500,000 U/L). Purification of this recombinant human erythropoietin to virtual homogeneity (greater than or equal to 99%) was accomplished via a simple three-step procedure involving isocratic elution from DEAE-Sephacel, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C4 medium, and the single-step elution of purified hormone from concanavalin A agarose. Overall, an 890-fold purification was accomplished with a recovery of 80% as assayed in vitro. Biologically, this purified erythropoietin is highly active, possessing a specific activity in vitro of 200,000 U/mg protein. Chemically, this erythropoietin (molecular weight [mol wt] 26,200) appears exceptionally uniform in its oligosaccharide constitution (30%) as contrasted with heterogeneously glycosylated erythropoietins derived from mammalian cells (mol wt 30,000 to 38,000; 40% to 50% complex-type oligosaccharide). Thus, human erythropoietin as presently produced in an insect cell line comprises not only an abundant source of highly active, readily purified hormone for studies of its mechanism of action and cell surface receptor, but also represents a uniquely homogeneous form that should prove advantageous for direct structural analyses.\r"

Fab fragments of a monoclonal antibody MoAb (LYP18), directed against the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex, inhibited platelet-melanoma interactions and platelet-platelet aggregation. M3Dau melanoma cells bind LYP 18 and synthesize IIb-IIIa-like GPs. When the melanoma cells were preincubated with LYP 18, tumor-platelet interaction did not occur, suggesting that the interaction may be mediated by the IIb-IIIa-like GPs present on the melanoma cell surface. Glanzmann's thrombasthenic platelets, lacking GPIIb and IIIa, did not interact with melanoma cells, indicating that the platelet GPIIb-IIIa complex is also necessary for the platelet-melanoma cell interaction. This work demonstrates the importance of the IIb-IIIa-like GPs, present on M3Dau melanoma cells, in mediating tumor-platelet interactions.\r"

Platelet ADP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), contents and thromboxane synthesis induced by thrombin and AA were normal. In quin2-loaded platelets, the basal intracellular Ca++ concentration, [Ca++]i, was normal; however, peak [Ca++]i measured in the presence of 1 mmol/L external Ca++ was consistently diminished following activation with ADP (25 mumol/L), PAF (20 mumol/L), collagen (5 micrograms/mL), U46619 (1 mumol/L), and thrombin (0.05 to 0.5 U/mL). In aequorin-loaded platelets, the peak [Ca++]i studied following thrombin (0.05 and 0.5 U/mL) stimulation was diminished. Myosin light chain phosphorylation following thrombin (0.05 to 0.5 U/mL) stimulation was comparable with that in the normal controls, while with ADP (25 mumol/L) it was more strikingly impaired in the propositus. We provide direct evidence that at least in some patients with inherited platelet secretion defects, agonist-induced Ca++ mobilization is impaired. This may be related to defects in phospholipase C activation. These patients provide a unique opportunity to obtain new insights into Ca++ mobilization in platelets.\r"

To further investigate changes in platelet-fibrinogen interactions, the present study examined the accessibility of platelet-bound fibrinogen and its GPIIb-IIIa receptor to antibody and enzyme probes as a function of time after platelet stimulation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Whereas only minimal changes in fibrinogen and 10E5 binding were observed within 60 minutes after platelet stimulation and equilibrium fibrinogen binding, the binding of polyclonal antifibrinogen antibodies decreased significantly (75% +/- 13%, mean +/- SD, n = 9). Similar decreases were noted with rabbit antifibrinogen Fab and F(ab')2 fragments. In addition, plasmin (32 mU/mL) added to platelets five minutes compared with 60 minutes after equilibrium fibrinogen binding dissociated 52% +/- 12% compared with 33% +/- 7% of platelet-bound fibrinogen in five minutes, and 83% +/- 15% compared with 66% +/- 14% of bound fibrinogen in 15 minutes. No difference in plasmin cleavage products was observed, however, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Complete fibrinogen dissociation occurred 30 minutes after plasmin addition, confirming that fibrinogen was not internalized. In contrast, dissociation of platelet-bound fibrinogen by chymotrypsin was less affected by time after equilibrium fibrinogen binding, and minimal changes in antifibrinogen antibody recognition and plasmin-induced dissociation of fibrinogen bound to stimulated but glutaraldehyde-fixed platelets were observed. The data suggest that ADP-induced fibrinogen binding to fresh platelets is accompanied by progressive rearrangements of fibrinogen on the platelet surface.\r"

  ".U": "89323417\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies in the guinea pig model system have established a close structural homology between human and guinea pig glycoproteins Ib (GPIb) and IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa). Moreover, the murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) PG-1, which recognizes GPIb in guinea pig platelets and megakaryocytes, exerted full inhibition on von Willebrand factor (vWF)-dependent platelet agglutination without inhibiting aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, or thrombin. The present research extends this animal model system to study of the effects on hemostatic function following the in vivo injection of MoAb PG-1 or its F(ab')2 fragments. A hind limb template bleeding time methodology was developed for use in guinea pigs. Normal bleeding time was determined to be 2.7 +/- 0.5 minutes (mean +/- SD), with an observed range of two to four minutes. Platelet counts in these same animals were 501 +/- 82 x 10(3)/microL. After intraperitoneal (IP) injection of busulfan, guinea pigs became increasingly thrombocytopenic. As long as the platelet count remained above approximately 150 x 10(3)/microL, the bleeding time was not more than five minutes; however, further decrease in the platelet count was accompanied by more marked prolongations of the bleeding time. For 14 to 72 hours after IP injection of 1.3 mg/kg intact PG-1 MoAb, a hemorrhagic state was produced with a bleeding time greater than 20 minutes. The platelet count concurrently decreased to approximately 50% of its baseline value but could not be further decreased either by raising the initial PG-1 dosage tenfold or by administering a second, equal dose 24 hours after the initial injection. This finding may reflect a heterogeneity of circulating platelets with respect to GPIb, to Fc receptors, or to an interaction between them. After IP injection of 0.63 to 2.5 mg/kg PG-1 F(ab')2 fragment, platelet counts did not decrease more than 21% below baseline levels in a 72-hour period, and bleeding times never increased by more than one minute over baseline values. Nevertheless, platelets obtained from animals 24 hours after injection of 2.5 mg/kg PG-1 F(ab')2 showed full inhibition of agglutination induced by ristocetin. The response of these platelets to aggregation by asialo-vWF was also severely inhibited as compared with control platelets. PG-1 F(ab')2 produced no effect on aggregation induced by ADP. These studies show that virtually complete functional block of the vWF receptor by F(ab')2 fragments of the anti-GPIb MoAb PG-1 is not sufficient to produce a hemorrhagic state in the guinea pig animal model system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We developed a mouse monoclonal antibody (MoAb 115-21) to human high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) that recognizes its prekallikrein binding site (residues 565 through 595 of HK). The corresponding synthesized 31-amino acid peptide (peptide IV) was recently shown to retain native HK's prekallikrein binding property. The same peptide bound factor XI also, although less avidly. Our MoAb recognizes purified HK, peptide IV, and the light chain moiety of HK (where the peptide IV resides), as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting experiments. The apparent dissociation constant for the HK and MoAb 115-21 interaction was 2.2 nmol/L. It does not recognize low-molecular-weight kininogen (LK) with which HK shares its heavy chain moiety or any antigens in human plasma congenitally deficient in kininogens. The binding of MoAb 115-21 to purified light chain of HK was competitively inhibited by peptide IV. In addition, the antibody inhibits HK-dependent clotting activity of normal human plasma and dextran sulfate-mediated activation of prekallikrein in plasma and retards cleavage of HK in normal plasma after contact activation with dextran sulfate. Also, purified Fab fragments of MoAb 115-21 inhibited the HK-dependent coagulant activity and dextran sulfate-mediated prekallikrein activation in normal plasma. Since the kd for HK-MoAb 115-21 interaction is ten times lower than that of HK-prekallikrein, our data suggest that binding of MoAb 115-21 to HK's peptide IV site increases the free prekallikrein concentration in plasma and thus results in the decreased efficiency of factor XIIa-mediated activation of prekallikrein. Decreased levels of kallikrein thus formed may be responsible for the inhibition of HK-dependent clotting activity and the decrease in rate and extent of HK cleavage in normal plasma on contact activation with dextran sulfate. MoAb 115-21 may thus prove very useful, especially with its high affinity for HK, in further delineation of the role of HK and prekallikrein in contact activation and kinin-related human pathology.\r"

We now provide data that the surface glycoprotein composition of MPS platelets is indistinguishable from that of normal platelets. However, a defect in calcium-activated neutral proteinase (calpain) was detected in MPS platelets. The specific activity of calpain in the cytosolic fraction of platelets from four MPS patients was found to be only 30% of that in platelets from normal control donors (n = 18, P less than .001). Additionally, platelets from MPS patients (n = 3) contained only 50% (P less than .001) of the calpain I catalytic subunit antigen found in platelets from normal control donors (n = 9). Platelets from the asymptomatic father/grandfather of the MPS patients had normal amounts of both total calpain proteolytic activity and calpain I catalytic subunit antigen. This represents the first report of a defect in calpain in human cells. The abnormally low calpain activity in MPS platelets may account for the platelet defects characteristic of this disorder.\r"

Using this assay, time, dose, and heparin-dependent complexes were detected when uPA was incubated with normal plasma or purified urinary PCI, whereas no complexes were measurable using PCI-immunodepleted plasma. Plasma samples (containing 20 mmol/L benzamidine to prevent complex formation ex vivo) from patients undergoing systemic urokinase therapy (1 x 10(6) IU/60 min intravenously [IV]) after myocardial infarction were also studied. uPA present in these plasma samples (up to 1,200 ng/mL) had only 43% to 70% of the specific activity of purified 2-chain uPA, suggesting that a major portion of uPA is complexed to inhibitors. In these plasma samples uPA-PCI complexes were present in a concentration corresponding to 21% to 25% of inactive uPA antigen. These data suggest that at high uPA concentrations, such as during uPA therapy, plasma PCI might contribute significantly to uPA inhibition in vivo.\r"

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 576 base pairs of exon h (VIII) with cloning and dideoxy sequencing of cloned DNA from one hemophiliac revealed a single C----T transition in codon 338 that changes an arginine residue codon CGA to a nonsense codon TGA. Allele-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization with a mutant (C----T) and a wild-type allele confirmed the same mutation in amplified genomic DNA of the second hemophilia patient. The C----T transition represents another example of mutation at a CpG dinucleotide. DNA polymorphism analysis of the FIX gene in both individuals revealed each to be on a separate FIX haplotype; therefore, predicting each to be a separate mutation event.\r"

Stimulation of neutrophils (PMNs) by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) did not result in OC cytolysis during the first nine hours of incubation. However, three of six specimens were significantly lysed by stimulated PMNs when assay length was increased to 18 hours. Cytotoxicity was mediated by PMN production of reactive oxidative intermediates (ROIs). Presentation of ROIs to OC targets as preformed or enzymatically generated molecules in cell-free systems duplicated the enhanced lysis at 18 hours (as compared with six hours). Since addition of catalase at three or six hours did not inhibit enhanced lysis at 18 hours (achieved by PMNs or in cell-free systems), it appears that an initial ROI-mediated lethal event occurs early, but longer incubations are required for the event to become manifested as cell death. These data suggest that shorter assays may underestimate the potential of PMNs as effector cells against human tumor cells.\r"

Subsequently, these viral genomes could be demonstrated to be monoclonal in origin using an EBV terminal region DNA probe.

A group of patients (109) with thalassemia major of the same origin served as control. Characterization of the beta-thalassemia mutation showed either a frameshift mutation at codon 6 or a codon 39 nonsense mutation. We found that homozygotes for the frameshift mutation at codon 6 or compound heterozygotes for this mutation and for the codon 39 nonsense mutation develop thalassemia intermedia more frequently than thalassemia major. The frameshift mutation at codon 6 was associated with haplotype IX that contains the C-T change at position -158 5' to the G gamma globin gene implicated in high gamma chain production and thus the mild phenotype. In patients' homozygotes for codon 39 nonsense mutation, those with thalassemia intermedia more frequently had the two-gene deletion form of alpha-thalassemia, or functional loss of the alpha 2 gene as compared with those with thalassemia major. In a few siblings with thalassemia major and intermedia, the thalassemia intermedia syndrome correlated with the presence of the -alpha/-alpha genotype. No cause for the mild phenotype was detected in the majority of patients who had not inherited either haplotype IX or alpha-thalassemia.\r"

It is manifested by a reduction of spectrin dimer self-association and by the development of a major 78-Kd fragment at the expense of the alpha l 80-Kd fragment upon spectrin-limited digestion. Amino acid sequence analysis, following peptide transfer onto Immobilon membranes, showed that the 78-Kd fragment results from a sensitized cleavage after lysyl residue 10. Using a 13.5-kb genomic alpha-spectrin probe and the Xbal, Pvull, and Mspl polymorphic sites detected with this probe, we concluded that spectrin Tunis is associated with the + - + haplotype (in the above order). Twenty mer oligonucleotides, complementary to genomic segments from introns 2 and 3, respectively, were synthesized. We then performed DNA amplification and sequencing. In the two investigated carriers of spectrin Tunis, we found the C----T base substitution of the codon corresponding to position 35 of the alpha l domain (CGG----TGG; Arg----Trp). The mutation lies in the last part of an alpha helix that extends from residues 9 to 44 of partial repeat alpha 1' and is comparable with helix 3 of full repeats 1 to 5. The modified proteolytic site, located 25 amino acid residues upstream, occurs at the beginning of the helix.\r"

We examined the structure, organization, and inheritance of Sta gene identified in genomic DNA from an Oriental family. Southern blotting detected a useful genetic marker tightly linked to the Sta gene. Differential hybridization and secondary restriction analyses showed that Sta gene is a fusion hybrid of delta and alpha glycophorin genes. Genomic mapping by extensive use of synthetic oligonucleotides, with overlapping sequence specificity, allowed us to define the delta-alpha junction site and disclose the organization of the variant gene. The junction point of Sta hybrid gene is encompassed by an unexpressed exonlike sequence of the delta gene at the 5' site, and an expressed sequence of the alpha gene spanning codons 59 through 71, at the 3' site. Dosage quantification demonstrated the occurrence of Sta gene as a single copy in the genome. Blood group inheritance, evaluated by DNA typing, established the tight linkage of Sta to the alpha M and delta S genes. The data support a single unequal crossing-over event between misaligned delta and alpha genes on the homologous chromosomes as the mechanism for the origin of Sta gene. The Sta gene is similar in overall structure to another delta-alpha hybrid gene, Dantu, but differs from it in junction structure, copy number, gene linkage, and antigen specificity.\r"

ADA expression from these vectors was monitored in the ADA- human histiocytic lymphoma cell line DHL-9, and in the multipotential chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562. ADA expression in infected K562 cells was also measured after induction of megakaryoblastic differentiation by phorbol ester, and after induction of erythroid differentiation by sodium n-butyrate or hemin. In these hematopoietic cell lines, the vectors that contained ADA controlled by either the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter (LASN) or the cytomegalovirus promoter (LNCA) expressed ADA at much higher levels than the other vectors tested. Furthermore, in K562 cells infected with LASN and LNCA vectors, induction of terminal differentiation resulted in the same or higher level expression of ADA. These cell lines have permitted the evaluation of transduced gene expression in proliferating and differentiating hematopoietic cells that provide a model for bone marrow-targeted gene therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Platelets are heterogeneous in the content of membrane glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa complex. To determine whether this heterogeneity is related to changes associated with platelet aging in the circulation, newly released platelets, obtained during recovery from nonimmune-mediated acute experimental thrombocytopenia in baboons, were studied. Monoclonal antibody (MoAb) binding to epitopes expressed on GPIIb/IIIa complex (LJ-CP8), GMP-140 (S12), and GPIa/IIa (12F1) was measured on control platelets (comprising platelets with a normal age distribution; mean age 60 to 72 hours) and newly formed platelets (mean age 12 hours), both in the resting state and after thrombin stimulation. Whereas LJ-CP8 binding to resting control platelets increased by 34% upon stimulation by gamma-thrombin from 30,885 +/- 1,171 to 41,458 +/- 1,311 molecules/platelet at saturating concentrations of antibody, LJ-CP8 binding to resting young platelets did not increase significantly upon thrombin stimulation (31,878 +/- 3,330 and 33,791 +/- 3,486 molecules/platelet, respectively). Similarly, binding of antibody S12 in response to maximal thrombin stimulation was reduced by 42% from 10,246 +/- 834 molecules/platelet at saturating concentrations of S12 for control platelets to 5,971 +/- 665 molecules/platelet for young platelets (P = .001). S12 binding to unstimulated platelets was less than 10% of the binding observed after thrombin stimulation at all concentrations of S12 for both control and young platelets. However, maximal binding of antibody 12F1 to resting control platelets did not differ significantly from that observed with resting young platelets (2,926 +/- 167 and 2,857 +/- 208 molecules/platelet, respectively), and 12F1 binding was unchanged after thrombin stimulation for both control and young platelets. We conclude that the thrombin-induced increase in the expression of epitopes on platelet membrane GPIIb/IIIa complex and GMP-140 is a function of platelet age.\r"

  ".U": "89323456\r", 
  ".W": "It has been shown that epitopes reactive with one group of rabbit antibodies to human fibrinopeptide A (hFPA, A alpha 1-16) are included in its COOH-terminal region (A alpha 7-16). It was further established that Asp-7, Phe-8, and Arg-16 contribute to immunoreactivity and that intact fibrinogen and hFPA-containing fragments react poorly with such antibodies. The purpose of this investigation was to prepare a synthetic peptide corresponding to A alpha 7-16 and use it for generation of FPA-specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Such probes would allow for development of assays that could measure hFPA directly in plasma. In our approach, an ovalbumin-conjugate of the hFPA homologue served as immunogen. Mouse spleen cells were fused with the immunoglobulin nonsecretor myeloma (P3X63Ag8.653). A hybridoma (8C2-5) has been isolated that secretes an antibody (MoAb/8C2-5) with the following characteristics: (a) IgG1, kappa isotype; (b) equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(7) L/mol with the [125I]-labeled N-tyrosyl derivative of hFPA [( 125I] Tyr-hFPA) as ligand; (c) reacts with hFPA and dog FPA (dFPA) but not with the des Arg (A alpha 1-15) or shorter peptides; (d) does not react with intact fibrinogen or A alpha-chain of human or dog origin; (e) does not react with the elastase-generated hFPA-containing peptide A alpha 1-21. Enzyme-based immunoassays (EIAs) have been developed for measuring plasma hFPA levels in the range 3 x 10(-8) to 5 x 10(-7) mol/L. Since it has already been shown by a number of investigators that hFPA levels in patients with overt defibrination fall into this range, we propose that the MoAb/8C2-5-based assays may serve as useful clinical tools in screening patients at risk of thrombosis. The 8C2-5 antibody may also be helpful in studies dealing with congenital dysfibrinogenemias, particularly in identifying heterozygous propositi with amino acid substitutions at any position within the A alpha 7-16 region. Finally, due to its cross-reactivity with dFPA, assays using this antibody should also be valuable in the canine experimental thrombosis model studies.\r"

Screening of 162 individuals within a cohort of white intravenous (IV) drug abusers, previously identified as having an increased incidence of HTLV-I infection, demonstrated that seven of them had antibodies to the HTLV-I Tax protein but tested negative in HTLV-I ELISAs and Western blots prepared from purified virion proteins. Three out of 35 individuals in other behaviorally defined high-risk groups also displayed this limited pattern of reactivity to HTLV-I proteins. The presence of the anti-HTLV-I p40/Tax antibodies was determined by radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), which also revealed low levels of anti-env reactivity. The specificity of the anti-p40 reactivity was confirmed on specific Tax ELISAs and Western blots prepared from recombinantly produced Tax. In vitro gene amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to establish the presence of sequences homologous to HTLV-I proviral DNA in four/four of these HTLV-I ELISA negative, Tax ELISA/Tax western blot/RIPA positive individuals. These data suggest that the true incidence of HTLV-I infection within high-risk cohorts is greater than previously reported.\r"

Because these activities were not replaced by known platelet mitogens, such as platelet-derived growth factor or transforming growth factor beta, we sought to identify the breast cancer cell mitogens by purification and N alpha amino-acid sequencing. Acetic acid extracts of outdated human platelets were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and fractionated on Sephadex G-50 and Bio-Gel P-10 columns in 0.5 mol/L acetic acid. Two major activities were resolved by molecular sieve methods and fractionated further by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Purifications (70,000 to 870,000-fold) were accomplished yielding mol wt 7,400 products that were homogeneous as determined by iodination, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and autoradiography. The factors were identified as insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) and II (IGF-II) and truncated IGF-I by N alpha amino acid microsequencing. In dose-response experiments, platelet-derived IGF-I and IGF-II promoted multiple divisions of the MCF-7 cells with ED50 values of 12 and 100 pg/mL, respectively. The specific activities and other bioassay characteristics of platelet-derived IGF-I and IGF-II were similar to those of recombinant-produced human growth factors. This is the first report of the purification of insulinlike growth factors from human platelet lysates.\r"

Purification from outdated human platelets identified insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) as the most potent breast cancer cell mitogen in lysates (Karey KP, Sirbasku DA: see accompanying article, this issue). In this study the release and subcellular localization of IGF-I was investigated. Degranulation of platelets by thrombin treatment caused release of lysosomal enzymes (beta-glucuronidase and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase), alpha-granule proteins (beta-thromboglobulin and fibrinogen) as well as mitogenic activity for MCF-7 cells and IGF-I as measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and radioreceptor assay. Release of mitogenic activity and immunologically identified IGF-I was induced tenfold over controls by thrombin and was nearly complete as compared to platelets disrupted by repeated freezing and thawing. Disruption of platelets by nitrogen cavitation followed by separation of the organelles by sucrose density gradient sedimentation showed that IGF-I and mitogenic activity localized predominantly to fractions containing alpha-granules rather than soluble cellular components, lysosomes, or dense granules. The morphology of MCF-7 cells in serum-free medium supplemented with supernatants from thrombin-treated platelets also indicated the release of important cell-adhesion factors for human breast cancer cells.\r"

Unlike chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), where the molecular detection of the Ph1 chromosome is relatively straightforward using conventional Southern hybridization analysis, the detection of the Ph1 chromosome in ALL is complicated by the existence of several molecular subtypes, and the fact that translocation breakpoints are dispersed over a large genomic area. To circumvent these difficulties, we investigated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to determine if this method could be used directly on clinical samples to detect the Ph1 chromosome in ALL. We report that, in a study of seven patients with Ph1-positive ALL, we could easily detect the Ph1 using only a single PFGE analysis, regardless of the Ph1 subtype, and we could confirm that the translocations occur either within or very near the BCR gene in all seven. We conclude that PFGE is a useful technique for the detection of the Ph1 in ALL, which ultimately may find wide applicability in the detection of other chromosomal abnormalities in other malignancies.\r"

Primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) is a plasma cell dyscrasia that shares many features with myeloma. We obtained bromodeoxyuridine LI on 125 patients who presented with AL, 22 of whom also had overt multiple myeloma. Forty-six patients had a plasma cell LI greater than 0%. Of the 46 patients with an elevated LI, 19 (41%) had multiple myeloma as compared with three (4%) of the 79 patients with an LI = 0 (P less than .0001). A response to chemotherapy was seen in 14 (30%) of 46 patients with an LI greater than 0, as compared with ten (13%) of 79 patients with an LI of 0 (P = .015). The median survival of the high LI group was 14.6 months v 29.8 months for the low LI group (P = .02). In the low LI group, 29% are projected to be alive at 60 months, as compared with 20% in the high LI group. When patients with myeloma were excluded from the analysis, the LI did not predict response but continued to indicate a survival disadvantage (P less than .05). The major utility of the LI was in identifying those patients most likely to have multiple myeloma and those AL patients with a poor prognosis (median survival, 14.1 months).\r"

  ".W": "Membrane skeletal and cytoskeletal remodeling occurs throughout erythroid maturation. Microtubules and microfilaments have been identified morphologically in the nucleated erythroblast but the functional capability of these cytoskeletal structures during reticulocyte maturation has not been studied. Reticulocytes are formed from orthochromatic normoblasts by the process of nuclear extrusion. Two recognizable stages of reticulocyte maturation follow. The least mature reticulocytes are motile and multilobular, while the more mature reticulocytes are cup-shaped and nonmotile. To study the respective roles of microtubules and microfilaments in nuclear extrusion and cell motility, experiments were performed with agents that perturb these structures. Following the injection into rats of colchicine, a microtubule-disrupting substance, the number of normoblasts arrested at the stage of nuclear extrusion increased linearly over four hours. Similar results were obtained when bone marrow cells were incubated in culture in the presence of colchicine. In contrast, cell motility was dramatically decreased by cytochalasin B, a microfilament-disrupting agent, but not by colchicine. These results imply that microtubules are essential for the nuclear extrusion process, while microfilaments are essential for cell motility. Simultaneous changes in membrane skeletal assembly were assessed by measuring membrane deformability and stability, two properties regulated by the skeletal proteins. In ektacytometric assays, membrane deformability and mechanical stability of immature reticulocytes were markedly decreased to approximately 10% of normal, while that of more mature reticulocytes were nearly normal. Since the skeletal protein organization regulates these membrane properties, our findings imply that substantial membrane skeletal remodeling occurs during reticulocyte maturation. Thus we have identified major remodeling of both skeletal and cytoskeletal components during reticulocyte maturation.\r"

  ".U": "89323468\r", 
  ".W": "Limited tryptic digestion of spectrin (Sp) from seven related individuals manifesting hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) or hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) phenotypes revealed the presence of a novel peptide with a molecular weight of 78 Kd and a concomitant decrease in the alpha I domain (80-Kd peptide), which is the domain involved in the dimer self-association process. Sp from the normal members of this white family exhibited a normal peptide pattern, as compared with controls. The abnormal peptide pattern was associated with a decreased ability of Sp dimer to self-associate. In this kindred in which three generations were available for study, the clinical manifestations were quite variable and ranged from the asymptomatic HE carrier state to hemolytic HE or to severe anemia requiring splenectomy. The severity of the disease appeared to be correlated both with the amount of mutant spectrin (31% to 69%) and with the excess of the Sp dimer found in the membrane (26% to 60%, compared with a normal value of 5.6% +/- 2.2%). Partial amino acid sequencing showed that the alpha I/78-Kd peptide resulted from cleavage at lysine residue 10 of the alpha I/80-Kd domain. Knowledge of the exon/intron structure of cloned genomic DNA encoding the alpha I domain allowed us to amplify in vitro a DNA fragment containing the third exon of the alpha-spectrin gene. The amplified fragment was subcloned and sequenced. A G to T transversion was found in the 39th codon (AGT for AGG), which changed the normal arginine to a serine. Hybridization of amplified DNAs with allele-specific oligonucleotides corresponding to the normal and mutant sequences confirmed the presence of the mutation in three other HE members of the family (the propositus mother, brother, and sister).\r"

One hundred sixty-two single donor platelet transfusions mismatched only for this antigen group were administered to 54 alloimmunized patients who were refractory to random donor platelets. Satisfactory increments (one-hour post-transfusion corrected-count increment [CCI] greater than 7,500) were seen following 111/162 transfusions (69%). In 31 patients (57%), all transfusions (n = 85) produced CCI greater than 7,500, and 76% of patients received some transfusions that were satisfactory. Of note is that ten patients had excellent increments despite either preformed lymphocytotoxic antibody against the mismatched antigen or positive lymphocytotoxic cross-matches with the donor. In contrast, poor increments were seen in ten recipients under similar circumstances, implying disparities in antigen expression on the platelets and lymphocytes of different donors. There was no obvious pattern of other donor HLA antigens which could be correlated with these differences. The HLA B12 antigen group is relatively common (found in approximately 25% of the population), and these data indicate that selective mismatching for these antigens can be an effective donor-selection strategy to increase the number of donors for alloimmunized recipients.\r"

The M3Dau melanoma cells specifically bound 125I-labeled LYP18. To study the biologic role of these IIb/IIIa-like glycoproteins, M3Dau melanoma cells were incubated with LYP18 or a control MoAb directed against another melanoma cell-surface antigen and implanted subcutaneously (SC) in nude mice. LYP18 dramatically inhibited the growth of tumor in vivo. LYP18 was not directly cytotoxic to the melanoma cells. These results demonstrate that the IIb/IIIa-like GPs are present on melanoma cells and play a crucial role in tumor cell growth.

  ".W": "Tumor cell-associated expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) was quantitated in 22 patients with DNA-aneuploid myeloma using 2-parameter flow cytometry with monoclonal antibody (MoAb) C-219 for the detection of cytoplasmic p-170 and propidium iodide for nuclear DNA content. The proportion of cells expressing p-170 and the intensity of p-170-related fluorescence were determined for each patient. Among the 14 patients treated with vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD), the proportion of p-170-positive cells distinguished sensitive from resistant disease (P less than .01). Among a subgroup of seven patients with MDR analysis available prior to VAD therapy, two subsequent nonresponders had high proportions of C-219-reactive cells. The presence de novo of high proportions of p-170-expressing cells in another still untreated patient and in a further individual with resistance to dexamethasone and interferon (not associated with MDR) warrants systematic analysis of p-170 expression prior to therapy to determine its clinical implications for response to MDR-associated drugs as combined in the VAD regimen. Concurrent MDR expression by aneuploid tumor cells and cells in the diploid subcompartment may represent involvement of diploid cells in the myeloma disease process.\r"

Mast cells were vitally stained with neutral red, and highly degranulated mast cells were identified under a phase-contrast microscope and individually picked up with the micromanipulator. When these highly degranulated mast cells were individually plated in methylcellulose, their potential to produce a cluster or a colony was comparable to that of morphologically intact mast cells. Moreover, when highly degranulated mast cells were injected into the skin of genetically mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice, the proportion of injection sites at which mast cell clusters appeared was comparable to the value observed when morphologically intact mast cells were injected. The present result indicates that proliferative potential of mast cells is not reduced by their degranulation.\r"

  ".W": "A simple procedure is described for the quantitation and enrichment of murine hematopoietic cells with the capacity for long-term repopulation of lymphoid and myeloid tissues in lethally irradiated mice. To ensure detection of the most primitive marrow cells with this potential, we used a competitive assay in which female recipients were injected with male \"test\" cells and 1 to 2 x 10(5) \"compromised\" female marrow cells with normal short-term repopulating ability, but whose long-term repopulating ability had been reduced by serial transplantation. Primitive hematopoietic cells were purified by flow cytometry and sorting based on their forward and orthogonal light-scattering properties, and Thy-1 and H-2K antigen expression. Enrichment profiles for normal marrow, and marrow of mice injected with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) four days previously, were established for each of these parameters using an in vitro assay for high proliferative potential, pluripotent colony-forming cells. When all four parameters were gated simultaneously, these clonogenic cells were enriched 100-fold. Both day 9 and day 12 CFU-S were copurified; however, the purity (23%) and enrichment (75-fold) of day 12 CFU-S in the sorted population was greater with 5-FU-treated cells. Five hundred of the sorted 5-FU marrow cells consistently repopulated recipient lymphoid and myeloid tissues (greater than 50% male, 1 to 3 months post-transplant) when co-injected with 1 to 2 x 10(5) compromised female marrow cells, and approximately 100 were sufficient to achieve the same result in 50% of recipients under the same conditions. This relatively simple purification and assay strategy should facilitate further analysis of the heterogeneity and regulation of stem cells that maintain hematopoiesis in vivo.\r"

A strong signal was found in murine marrow cells having the morphologic features of erythroblasts. This result was confirmed in human marrow cells using a double labeling technique (in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry). A majority (70%) of the cells expressing c-fos mRNA were glycophorin A-positive. In contrast, granulocytic precursors (CD 15-positive) or monocytes and their precursors (CD 14-positive cells) did not significantly hybridize with the c-fos probe. In addition, c-fos mRNA (2.2Kb) was detected by Northern blotting in RNA extracted from homogeneous populations of erythroblasts obtained by immune panning from fetal liver and from adult blood BFU-E-derived colonies. Fos protein was also detected in erythroblasts by immunofluorescence. The high level of c-fos mRNA previously found in hematopoietic tissue should therefore be related to the transcription of the c-fos gene during terminal erythroid differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human erythropoietin labeled covalently with biotin at sialic acid moieties has been prepared, and has been shown to possess high biological activity plus utility as a receptor ligand. Initially, the effects on biological activity of covalently attaching biotin to erythropoietin alternatively at carboxylate, amino, or sialic acid groups were compared. Biotinylation of erythropoietin at carboxylate groups using biotin-amidocaproyl hydrazide plus 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide led to substantial biological inactivation, although biotinylated molecules retained detectable activity when prepared at low stoichiometries. Biotinylation at amino groups using sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido) hexanoate resulted in a high level of biological inactivation with little, if any, retention of biological activity, regardless of labeling stoichiometries. Biotinylation at sialic acid moieties using periodate and biotinamidocaproyl hydrazide proceeded efficiently (greater than 95% and 80% labeling efficiencies for human urinary and recombinant erythropoietin, respectively) and yielded stably biotinylated erythropoietin molecules possessing comparably high biological activity (ie, 45% of the activity of unmodified hormone). Utility of recombinant biotin-(sialyl)-erythropoietin (in combination with 125I-streptavidin) in the assay of cell surface receptors was demonstrated using two distinct murine erythroleukemia cell lines, Friend 745 and Rauscher Red 1. The densities and affinities of specific hormone binding sites were 116 +/- 4 sites, 3.3 +/- 0.4 nmol/L kd and 164 +/- 5 sites, 2.7 +/- 0.4 nmol/L kd, respectively. It is predicted that the present development of biotin-(sialyl)-erythropoietin as a chemically and biologically stable, bioactive ligand will assist in advancing an understanding of the regulated expression and physicochemistry of the human and murine erythropoietin receptors.\r"

  ".U": "89323488\r", 
  ".W": "The cytoadhesin family consists of platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa and the endothelial vitronectin receptor. The beta subunit (GP IIIa) of these complexes expresses the alloantigen Zwa (or PIA1). This alloantigen is not expressed by members of other integrin subfamilies. By using immunoprecipitation and immunoblot techniques, we found that the beta subunit of a heterodimer, expressed by cultured human arterial smooth muscle cells and cultured foreskin fibroblasts, carries the Zwa antigenic determinant. Furthermore, the mobilities of the alpha and beta subunits of these two heterodimers are indistinguishable from those of the alpha and beta subunits of the endothelial vitronectin receptor. Therefore, we propose that the smooth muscle cell and fibroblast heterodimer are members of the cytoadhesin family. In Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, platelet GP IIb-IIIa is absent or severely reduced. Previously, we showed that endothelial cells from a thrombasthenic patient normally synthesize and express a GP IIb-IIIa-related molecule (the vitronectin receptor). Here we show that arterial smooth muscle cells, obtained from the same patient, express a surface molecule indistinguishable from the endothelial vitronectin receptor. We also demonstrate that both the endothelial and the smooth muscle cell GP IIIa-related molecule in this Glanzmann patient express Zwa. Our data indicate that (a) GP IIb-IIIa-related molecules on cell types other than platelets and endothelial cells can express Zwa in vitro, and (b) patients with Glanzmann's disease can express the Zwa antigen. This study substantiates our view that the defect in Glanzmann's disease is restricted to the megakaryocytes/platelets.\r"

  ".W": "A potential physiologic role of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) on platelet function is proposed in this report. It is widely accepted that ATP competitively inhibits adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. Our observations of platelet aggregation with the agonists, collagen, epinephrine, and ADP in the presence of 180 mumol/L ATP could support this competitive nature of ATP. However, the disaggregation of maximally aggregated platelets induced by ATP, theophylline, or ATP plus theophylline indicates that additional mechanisms of ATP action may be present. Extracellular gamma-32P-ATP (7 pmol) labels surface-membrane proteins in intact platelets as demonstrated by several criteria. The reaction is Ca++-dependent. Stimulation by calcium occurs in the physiologic range of 1 to 5 mmol/L. Significant levels of phosphorylation occur within one minute with near maximal levels reached by five minutes. Platelet cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels were elevated in a dose-dependent fashion in cells incubated for four minutes with increasing amounts of extracellular ATP (18 to 540 nmol). The addition of ATP plus theophylline resulted in a synergistic stimulation of cAMP levels. ATP was not being hydrolyzed to adenosine by plasma nucleotidases, as demonstrated by the lack of effect of ten U of adenosine deaminase. The phosphorylation of surface proteins by extracellular ATP released from activated platelets may modulate platelet responsiveness to agonists at distances removed from the site of vascular injury. Phosphorylation may also play a role in signal transduction to regulate the levels of intracellular cAMP, which further inhibits platelet activation.\r"

Contamination of the face and eyes accounted for 46% (46 of 99 operations) of the contamination occurring in endoscopic surgery.

The surgeons' eyes should be protected by modification of urological techniques and equipment to avoid spillage.\r"

The method using 4-day records seemed to be more precise, judged by the correlation to the urinary output of nutrients. There was no difference in the daily intake of major nutrients between stone formers and controls, but a higher ingestion of vitamin C in controls and a larger consumption of alcohol among stone formers. In contrast to some epidemiological evidence, there were no significant differences in consumption of animal protein when stone formers were matched for social class. Despite a similar total intake of calcium, the stone formers excreted more calcium in the urine, probably reflecting a higher intestinal absorption of calcium. There seem to be only marginally different dietary habits between stone formers and carefully matched control subjects. Differences in the urinary output of minerals and electrolytes are mainly due to variations in gastrointestinal uptake.\r"

We have been unable to differentiate primary from secondary RTA in renal stone formers. Regardless of whether the acidification defect is primary or secondary to stone formation, however, all renal stone formers with distal RTA can expect to benefit from prophylactic alkaline therapy and it is recommended that the screening procedure, which is easy to use in daily clinical practice, is applied to all stone formers and not restricted to patients with recurrent stone disease.\r"

Six clinical measurements were evaluated: haemoglobin, ESR, alpha 2 globulin, temperature, weight and C reactive protein. In addition, performance status, the number of organs with metastases, number of metastatic lesions and tumour growth rate were measured. The results showed that in patients surviving for 1 year or more after nephrectomy, there was an abnormality in the results of 3 or less of the 6 clinical measurements, performance was 0 or 1, and the carcinoma had metastasised to only one organ. In addition, it was found that the growth of metastatic lesions in patients who survived for 3 years or more was much slower than in the other patients. Nephrectomy was found to be effective in only 27% of our cases and we consider that careful deliberation should be made pre-operatively as to whether nephrectomy is really necessary in patients with metastasis.

  ".W": "TUR chips from 89 men were analysed prospectively for androgen and oestrogen nuclear and cytoplasmic receptors (ANR, ACR, ONR, OCR). Patients were selected on the basis of suspicion of neoplastic change on clinical feel of the prostate. A control group of benign cases was also collected prospectively. Histological examination showed that 46 patients had prostatic carcinoma and 43 had benign prostatic hyperplasia. No difference was found between the 2 groups in terms of prevalence of any of the receptors or in levels of receptor in those who were positive. The patients with neoplastic changes were followed up for a median of 53 months (range 47-64). No significant effect on duration of survival was noted with any of the receptor variables but there was a beneficial association between cytoplasmic oestrogen receptor positivity and progression-free interval. Patients with T category 3 or 4 had a significantly higher chance of being ANR positive than those of lower T category and this may reflect sampling error. There appears to be some evidence to suggest that cytosol oestrogen receptor positivity has a prognostic role in prostate cancer, in terms of time to progression on hormone therapy. Receptor status did not influence survival.\r"

Using the objective criteria of the US NPCP, 1 complete, 2 partial and 14 stable responses were obtained for a total response rate of 14.3%, while 102 patients continued to progress. The 50% probability of survival was 21.0 months for the responders and 9.2 months for the non-responders. The present data indicate that further androgen blockade with AG + low dose HC is well tolerated and can be of benefit to a significant proportion of patients in progression at a very late stage of the disease.\r"

When you plow behind an old mule and hit a stump hole full of cottonmouth moccasins, you have to get on the move in a hurry and figure out some solution to the predicament or you won't get your corn planted. So, I was not treating the overweight, knock-kneed, loose-jointed, teenaged girl, but the young boy or girl who thought that he or she was an athlete and had dreams of being a star. If rehabilitation did not work, then I thought a lateral release, an Elmslie, and nothing short of a full reconstruction would solve the problem. One had to develop as much vastus medialis obliquus power as this dysplastic muscle could generate, had to transfer the strong vastus lateralis to a more central pull, and, with the distal reconstruction, correct any patella alta and Q-angle abnormality. One had to give the knee every possible advantage in order to serve an athlete. As Hippocrates so wisely noted, one needed to study the athlete to know, with appropriate modifications, what is best for every patient, young or old. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many fine young orthopedists were stimulated by the information of the AAOS postgraduate courses in sports medicine. They, after having gained further through their own experiences, have become the major contributors to our increasing knowledge of the patellofemoral joint, especially in athletes, and many of these fine \"young\" (now a little older) orthopedists are now the contributors to this issue. They are giving you their experiences, knowledge, and lessons. A close and repeated study of their information must be combined with compassion for your patient. Then, only experience will develop the desired fine tuning.\r"

This study was undertaken in the rat to determine if muscle encased in collagen would subsequently become either necrotic or atrophic. For this purpose, we monitored the fibrillar nature of myocardial collagen, its alignment with muscle, and the morphology of the endomyocardium, together with the response in diastolic and systolic myocardial stiffness, immediately on completion (10 days) and 30 days after a course of subcutaneous isoproterenol (500 micrograms/kg/day). We found 1) left ventricular hypertrophy at 10 and 30 days with an increase in collagen volume fraction (p less than 0.01) that consisted of a meshwork of thick and thin collagen fibers that encircled endomyocardial muscle, 2) a variable reduction in endocardial muscle fiber diameter at 30 days with the greatest thinning seen in muscle encircled by fibrous tissue, and 3) an elevation (p less than 0.01) in the slope of the diastolic stress-strain relation at 10 and 30 days. The developed systolic stress-strain relation, which was elevated at 10 days (p less than 0.01), declined (p less than 0.05) with the reduction in endomyocardial muscle mass. Thus, endomyocardial muscle, encircled by fibrillar collagen, will atrophy over time, and this leads to a reduction in active stiffness. These findings may, in part, explain why progressive ventricular dysfunction accompanies chronic myocardial disease with endomyocardial fibrosis.\r"

One month after being on this diet, the pigs were anesthetized and the endothelium of a branch of the left coronary artery was denuded using a balloon catheter. X-ray irradiation in a dose of 1,500 rad was given twice selectively to the area denuded, after 4 and 5 months of cholesterol feeding. Five months after endothelial denudation, transient (group A) and repetitive episodes (group B) of coronary spasm were provoked by single and periodic (five times every 5 minutes) intracoronary injections of serotonin (10 micrograms/kg/injection), respectively. The extent of spasm by serotonin at the previously denuded site was 84 +/- 4% (n = 4) and 90 +/- 5% (n = 6) narrowing in groups A and B (p = NS between groups), respectively. Forty minutes after the final administration of serotonin, the left coronary artery was relaxed by nitroglycerin, and the heart was isolated and perfuse-fixed under physiological pressure. Intramural hemorrhage was noted at the spastic site in six pigs of group B but not in group A. The average percent luminal narrowing, on cross sections at the spastic site in group B, was significantly greater than in group A (56 +/- 7% vs. 23 +/- 5%, p less than 0.01). Scanning electron micrographs revealed that the endothelial lining was intact at the nonspastic site in both groups. In addition to the appearance of intercellular bridges at the spastic site in both groups, squeezing of endothelial cells and adhesion of white blood cells were present at the spastic site exclusively in group B. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that repetitive spasm may have an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis and/or myocardial infarction.\r"

[125I]VIP binding demonstrated upwardly concave, curvilinear Scatchard plots consistent with two classes of binding sites. Only the high-affinity (dissociation constant [Kd] 400-800 pM) site could be regulated by guanine nucleotides. Compared with nonfailing heart, membranes derived from failing heart exhibited a twofold reduction in the Kd of the high-affinity VIP binding site, whereas the receptor density (Bmax) was decreased by 62%. In concordance with this decreased receptor density and increased affinity, the maximal contractile response of right ventricular trabeculae from failing right ventricles was decreased by 61%, and the dose-response curve to VIP was left-shifted approximately threefold. We conclude that the VIP receptor in failing human ventricular myocardium exhibits novel regulatory behavior consisting of increased receptor affinity and decreased receptor density.\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiology of antidromic reentry, a less common phenomenon than orthodromic reentry, remains a poorly understood aspect of the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. We used a pacing model of ventricular preexcitation in patients without WPW, so that electrophysiological events in the normal pathway during atrial extrastimulation (A1-A2 technique) could be precisely delineated without the obscuring effect of an actual accessory pathway. Ventricular preexcitation was simulated by an A1-V1 sequential basic drive with A2-V2 extrastimulation at progressively shorter A1-A2 (equal to V1-V2) coupling intervals. At each coupling interval tested within the zone of atrioventricular (A-V) nodal effective refractory period (since anterograde block of A2 was considered mandatory for manifestation of antidromic reentry), responses were assessed after A2 alone (method I), V2 alone (method II), and A2 plus V2 (method III, the complete preexcitation model). The entire pacing protocol was performed at two A-V intervals, short (50 msec) and long (150-180 msec), thereby simulating different proximities between the A pacing site and \"accessory pathway\" location. Of 47 consecutive unmedicated patients screened for the study protocol, 38 failed to meet minimal prerequisites for possible initiation of antidromic reentry because of failure in 18 (38% of total) to achieve anterograde A-V nodal block of A2, even though 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction to cycle lengths less than or equal to 500 msec (less than or equal to 400 msec in 12) was present; and poor or absent ventriculoatrial conduction in the others. The nine remaining candidates underwent the full pacing protocol. Antidromic reentry (retrograde atrial response following V2 in method III) was observed in only two cases (4% of total), and both were associated with retrograde His-Purkinje system delays (documented by method II) occurring in tandem with a long A-V interval, thereby allowing for completion of retrograde A-V nodal recovery after penetration by A2. Indeed, such a prolonged recovery time prevented initiation of antidromic reentry in six of the nine patients (proven by intact ventriculoatrial conduction in method II). Retrograde A-V nodal block of V2, independent of A2, prevented an antidromic echo in one case. Findings in our model help to clarify the various factors, including specific anterograde and retrograde A-V nodal properties; anatomic relation between the accessory and normal pathways; and the retrograde His-Purkinje system delays, that must prevail in a concerted fashion to permit the initiation of antidromic reentry during the A1-A2 technique in patients with the WPW syndrome.\r"

Most of our knowledge of this systolic direct ventricular interaction comes from studies of isolated hearts, which suggest that changes in right ventricular size only affect left ventricular systolic function at low pressures and volumes. However, almost nothing is known about systolic direct ventricular interaction in a heart functioning in situ as a part of the intact circulation. We used sudden constriction of the pulmonary artery to assess the immediate effect of a change in right ventricular pressure and contraction pattern on left ventricular contraction and relaxation on the beat following the pulmonary artery constriction in anesthetized open-chest dogs. By focusing on this first beat, we were able to avoid the confounding effect of series ventricular interaction, which changes left ventricular filling and, thus, indirectly influences left ventricular function. At baseline left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9.6 +/- 2.1 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), sudden pulmonary artery constriction increased left ventricular peak systolic pressure by 3 +/- 2 mm Hg (2% change), left ventricular stroke volume by 2 +/- 2 ml (8% change), and monoexponential time constant of left ventricular pressure fall during relaxation by 9 +/- 6 msec (22% change). This increased left ventricular relaxation time constant was associated with altered regional segment length changes in the posterior and anterior left ventricular free walls during relaxation. We conclude that systolic direct ventricular interaction affects left ventricular systolic function and relaxation under normal conditions in the intact circulation.\r"

We examined the catecholaminergic histofluorescence and the contractile responses elicited by transmural electrical field stimulation and norepinephrine (NE) in proximal segments of human middle cerebral artery (MCA) obtained during autopsy. Twenty-four percent of the specimens were obtained within 2 hours and 76% within 4 hours of death. A moderately dense catecholaminergic histofluorescence was seen in all segments of human MCA using the glyoxylic acid technique, counterstained with pontamine sky blue. However, only seven of 35 (20%) MCA segments tested showed tetrodotoxin-blocked transmural electrical field stimulation contractions, and all of these were harvested within 4 hours of death. The responses were mostly seen in the most proximal MCA segments and, at 32 Hz, only achieved 6 +/- 1% of the maximal tissue contraction. NE caused two distinct responses in human MCA segments. At low concentrations, it acts via an alpha-like adrenoreceptor to cause contractions 20 +/- 3% of the maximal tissue response. The NE ED50s for the three successive segments were not different from each other; the value for the most-proximal segment was 7.9 +/- 0.2 x 10(-7) M. At concentrations above 10(-5) M, this catecholamine acts on low-affinity sites resistant to alpha-adrenergic antagonists causing contractions that at 10(-3) M reach 52 +/- 5% of the maximal tissue response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rewarming from 1 degree to 30 degrees C (in less than 0.5 second) activates mechanisms that contribute to the reduction of intracellular calcium concentration and thus relaxation (e.g., sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR] calcium pump and sarcolemmal Na-Ca exchange and calcium pump). Rapid rewarming in normal Tyrode's solution induces relaxation with a half-time (t1/2) of 217 +/- 14 msec (mean +/- SEM). During cold exposure, changing the superfusate to a sodium-free, calcium-free medium with 2 mM CoCl2 (to eliminate Na-Ca exchange) slightly slows relaxation upon rewarming in the same medium (t1/2 = 279 +/- 44 msec). Addition of 10 mM caffeine (which prevents SR calcium sequestration) to normal Tyrode's solution during cold superfusion slows relaxation somewhat more (t1/2 = 376 +/- 31 msec) than sodium-free, calcium-free solution. However, if both interventions are combined (sodium-free + caffeine) during the cold exposure and rewarming, the relaxation is greatly slowed (t1/2 = 2,580 +/- 810 msec). These results suggest that either the SR calcium pump or, to a lesser extent, sarcolemmal Na-Ca exchange can produce rapid relaxation, but if both systems are blocked, relaxation is very slow. If muscles are equilibrated with 500 nM ryanodine before cooling, relaxation upon rewarming is not greatly slowed (t1/2 = 266 +/- 37 msec) even if sodium-free, calcium-free solution is applied during the cold and rewarming phases (t1/2 = 305 +/- 66 msec). This result suggests that ryanodine does not prevent the SR from accumulating calcium to induce relaxation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To compensate for motion due to contraction of the heart, the epicardium was visualized with stroboscopic epi-illumination controlled by a computer to flash once per cardiac cycle in mid-diastole, making the vessels appear stationary.

To ascertain whether significant growth of coronary resistance vessels occurs with long-standing hypertension and LVH, we studied dogs with Goldblatt (one-kidney, one-clip) hypertension seven months after surgery. Left ventricular minimal coronary vascular resistance (LV MCVR) was derived from adenosine-induced maximal flow measured with 15 microns microspheres. Morphometric data were based on perfuse-fixed hearts arrested in diastole. Hypertension and LVH were associated with a 46% increase in left ventricular weight/body weight ratio (LVH, 6.73 +/- 0.31; control, 4.62 +/- 0.30), no significant change in LV MCVR/100 g, and a reduction in total LV MCVR (LVH, 0.11 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/ml/min; control, 0.15 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/ml/min). Arterial and arteriolar wall/lumen ratios were virtually identical in the two groups. Arteriolar (lumen diameter less than 200 microns) numerical densities (arteriolar profiles/mm2) were also similar for the two groups even when analyzed according to lumen diameter size class and by ventricular location (epimyocardium, midmyocardium, and endomyocardium). Moreover, the relative frequency distribution of any arteriolar size class was similar for both groups. Because MCVR and arteriolar density were normal, this study provides new evidence that angiogenesis during long-term LVH in this model is of sufficient magnitude to enable the cross-sectional area of the coronary resistance vessels to increase in proportion to the increase in left ventricular mass.\r"

In the present study, we used the expression of the neurofilament-like protein as a marker for identifying conduction tissue cells and studying their distribution in the developing heart. In 11-day-old rabbit embryos, myocytes expressing the neurofilament-like protein were localized at the atrioventricular and the sinoatrial junctions and had a ring-like distribution. At embryonic day 12, reactive myocytes were found also in the subendocardial layer of the dorsal ventricular wall, in continuity with labeled myocytes at the atrioventricular junction. Examination of older embryos and of neonatal and adult hearts revealed that the expression of the neurofilament-like protein was not restricted to myocytes of conduction tissue regions, but it was also detectable in myocytes of the sinoatrial ring bundle, in scattered myocytes localized in the left sinal horn wall, and in the right atrium in proximity to atrioventricular sulcus tissue. Thus, using an intracellular marker, we show that precursors of adult atrial conduction tissue are distributed at the sinoatrial and atrioventricular junctions; at variance, ventricular conduction tissue precursors do not have a ring-like distribution but are localized in the subendocardial layer, in continuity with the atrioventricular junctional myocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the adrenergic system on the population of ventricular myosin isoenzymes under physiological conditions was assessed by subjection of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to different types of physical exercise that increased the activity of the peripheral adrenergic system to varying degrees. The routines, which were 5-6 weeks in duration, involved the mild exercise of enforced swimming (2 x 90 min/day), spontaneous running (daily, about 15 km/10-12 hr) that resulted in absolute ventricular hypertrophy, and enforced running of low intensity (daily, 2 x 1.8 km/3 hr) but associated with marked stressors. Swimming and spontaneous running reduced the high blood pressure of SHR, whereas enforced running increased it. In both strains, the myosin isoenzymes were redistributed in the direction of V1 after swimming but not after running. In SHR, therefore, reduction of pressure load seems insufficient for induction of a higher proportion of V1. The unique and, until now, unexplained effect of swimming was attributed to the pronounced activation of the peripheral adrenergic system as judged from catecholamine stores of ventricles and adrenal glands. Only swimming increased the norepinephrine content of ventricles and adrenal glands in normotensive rats. Swimming also had the strongest influence in SHR. Further evidence for the influence of the adrenergic system came from the effect of selective cardiac beta-blockade with atenolol (50 mg/kg/day). The diminished adrenergic drive of the heart reduced the proportion of V1 to a greater extent in the swimming rats than in the sedentary rats. Taken together, the data demonstrate that substantial changes in adrenergic activity occur under physiological conditions associated with an altered myosin heavy-chain expression.\r"

Peak systolic pressure (PSP) and cardiac output (CO) decreased 40% by 4 minutes in control hearts perfused with 11 mM glucose and paced at 280 beats/min, compared with 50% in hearts from acutely diabetic rats. Addition of 1.2 mM palmitate to the perfusate accelerated failure rates, with PSP and CO decreasing 65% and 80% by 4 minutes in control and acutely diabetic rat hearts, respectively. In chronically diabetic rats, mechanical function could not be maintained in palmitate-perfused hearts paced at 280 beats/min, even in the absence of ischemia. If these hearts were paced at 250 beats/min and subjected to ischemia, PSP and CO decreased 90% by 4 minutes, regardless of whether palmitate was added to the perfusate. Under these conditions, PSP decreased less than 10% by 4 minutes in both palmitate- or glucose-perfused control hearts. Etomoxir (10(-9) M), a carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor, markedly decreased the rate of mechanical failure in both acutely and chronically diabetic rat hearts, in the presence and absence of palmitate. The beneficial effect of Etomoxir on mechanical function did not occur as a result of a decrease in either myocardial long chain acyl-coenzyme A or long chain acylcarnitine levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In spite of a higher NE spillover from kidneys in patients compared with controls (82 vs. 49 ng/min, p less than 0.01), renal extraction ratios of [3H]NE were similar in the two groups (0.33 vs. 0.32, NS), and no significant change was observed during the time of infusion.

  ".W": "The effects of an acute increase in left ventricular systolic pressure and the effects of an intravenous isoproterenol infusion on myocardial (segment) lengthening rate and chamber (minor axis dimension) filling rate were examined in 12 anesthetized dogs. Measurements of left ventricular systolic pressure (by micromanometer) and of segment length and chamber dimension transients (by ultrasonic crystals) were made in variably afterloaded beats (three-beat descending aortic cross-clamp) before and during an isoproterenol infusion that raised (+)dP/dt by 40%. During the baseline state, we found an inverse relation between the peak rate of increase in minor axis dimension [(+)dD/dt] and systolic pressure over a wide range of systolic pressures (110-160 mm Hg) and end-systolic dimensions (25-40 mm); peak (+)dD/dt and end-systolic dimension were also inversely related. During isoproterenol infusion, end-systolic dimension fell from 29.7 +/- 3.1 to 28.0 +/- 3.1 mm and (+)dD/dt increased from 79.6 +/- 8.0 to 90.1 +/- 8.7 mm/sec; however, the slope and y intercept of the relation between (+)dD/dt and end-systolic dimension were unchanged. Peak (+)dD/dt at a common end-systolic dimension of 31 mm was nearly equal during baseline and isoproterenol states (64.2 +/- 6.3 vs. 65.1 +/- 6.6 mm/sec). Similar results were found using segment length transients. We interpret these data to indicate that (+)dD/dt is strongly influenced by changes in systolic pressure and dimension and that isoproterenol-induced changes in (+)dD/dt are mediated, at least in part, through changes in systolic pressure and dimension.\r"

We have developed a method to examine permeability and vascular responses of the microcirculation of the area postrema in vivo. A craniotomy was performed over the dorsal brain stem in anesthetized rats, and blood vessels to the area postrema were visualized with fluorescein microscopy. Extravasation of sodium fluorescein (MW, 386), but not 150 kDa (MW) fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, occurred in the area postrema under control conditions. There was no extravasation of fluorescein or dextran in the brain stem under control conditions. Acute hypertension produced marked disruption of the barrier to 150 kDa dextran in the area postrema, compared with minimal disruption in the brain stem. We tested the hypothesis that the area postrema has greater permeability to small molecules than the brain stem and that this permeability might be accompanied by distinctive vascular responses. Topical suffusion of adenosine and ADP produced similar dose-related dilation of arterioles to area postrema and dorsal brain stem. Topical and intravenous vasopressin produced similar dose-related constriction of vessels to area postrema and brain stem. Electron microscopy in rats demonstrated that a barrier to horseradish peroxidase, which is absent in capillaries in the area postrema, is present in arterioles that supply the area postrema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89324315\r", 
  ".W": "Pinacidil belongs to a novel group of compounds that enhance the potassium permeability of vascular smooth muscle. Evidence also exists that this drug enhances the potassium permeability of cardiac tissue. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if pinacidil alters potassium-channel activity in heart and, if so, which potassium channel is the target. We used the whole-cell arrangement of the patch voltage clamp to record membrane currents from isolated guinea pig ventricular cells. In solutions designed to isolate potassium currents, pinacidil enhances a time-independent current positive to the potassium equilibrium potential. Current measured at voltages negative to the potassium equilibrium potential are essentially unaltered by the drug. The potassium sensitivity of outward current indicates that the target for the drug is a potassium channel. Experiments designed to test for voltage-dependent channel gating strongly suggest that the pinacidil-sensitive current is not voltage gated. Pinacidil-sensitive current is blocked by externally applied Ba2+, Cs+, and tetraethylammonium ion. In addition, it is potently blocked after external application of 100 nM glibenclamide. Taken along with the time- and voltage-independent properties of pinacidil-sensitive current, this pharmacology strongly suggests that the target for pinacidil in heart is the ATP-sensitive potassium channel.\r"

  ".U": "89324316\r", 
  ".W": "The relation between functional properties of the contractile apparatus, such as shortening velocity and ATPase activity, and myosin isoenzyme composition was studied in ventricular myocardium of adult (60-90-day-old) rats and of newborn (3-day-old) and young (10- and 20-day-old) rats. In adult animals, variations of isomyosin pattern were produced by reducing food intake and by changing the thyroid state. Hyperthyroidism was induced with triiodothyronine daily injection for 15 days; hypothyroidism was induced with iodine-free diet and KClO4 in drinking water for 50-60 days. The following parameters were studied: 1) calcium-magnesium-activated and magnesium-activated ATPase activity of washed and purified myofibrils, 2) calcium-activated ATPase activity of purified myosin, 3) isomyosin composition and relative content of alpha-myosin heavy chains (alpha-MHCs), and 4) force-velocity curve of left and right ventricle papillary muscles. To take into account the difference in excitation-contraction coupling between newborn and adult myocardium, the determination of the force-velocity curve was repeated in Krebs' solution with normal [CaCl2] (2.5 mM) and in Krebs' solution with high [CaCl2] (10 mM). During postnatal growth, the relative content of alpha-MHC increased and reached a maximum at about 20 days. Pronounced increases of myofibrillar and myosin ATPase activity and in shortening velocity occurred during the same period. In adult hyperthyroid rats, alpha-MHC content as well as enzymatic activity and shortening velocity were higher than in control adult animals. Hypothyroidism and food deprivation caused a decrease of alpha-MHC content and a reduction of both enzymatic activities and shortening velocity. The study of the relations between alpha-MHC relative content and functional parameters showed that 1) in ventricular myocardium of adult rats a linear relation existed between alpha-MHC content and myosin and myofibrillar ATPase activity and shortening velocity, and 2) in newborn and young rat ventricular myocardium, both enzymatic activities and shortening velocity were lower than would have been expected on the basis of the linear relation described above. This latter observation could be accounted for by a variation in specific activity of myosin during postnatal development or by the presence of peculiar isomyosins that cannot be detected with usual electrophoretic techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the behavior of sonicated albumin microbubbles accurately mimics red blood cell flow in the microcirculation and is thus consistent with their use as in vivo tracers of red blood cell flow during myocardial contrast echocardiography. Accordingly, microbubbles prepared from fluorescein-conjugated albumin and fluorescently labeled red blood cells were injected intravascularly in eight golden hamsters. Their intravascular distribution, velocities, arteriolar-to-venular transit and flux ratios at branch points were determined in the microcirculation of the cheek pouch. Albumin microbubbles (mean diameter, 4.9 +/- 3.6 microns) and red blood cells displayed a similar frequency of distribution across the arteriolar lumen (33% in the central 20% of the arterioles), and their arteriolar velocities were also similar (2.5 +/- 0.7 mm/sec and 2.3 +/- 0.7 mm/sec,p = NS). The mean velocities of microbubbles correlated well with those of red blood cells at baseline and after adenosine application (r = 0.97 and r = 0.89, respectively), as did the calculated maximum velocity (r = 0.98 and r = 0.80, baseline and adenosine, respectively). The velocity profiles across the lumen of the vessels for albumin microbubbles and red blood cells were similar at baseline and after adenosine-induced velocity changes. The flux ratios at branch points also correlated well (r = 0.92, p less than 0.001). Arteriolar-to-venular transit times of albumin microbubbles were similar to those of red blood cells in vessels ranging in size from 22 microns to 45 microns. We conclude that the behavior of albumin microbubbles in the microcirculation mimics that of red blood cells and supports their use as intravascular tracers of red blood cell flow during myocardial contrast echocardiography.\r"

In nine healthy subjects, we measured arterial pressure, heart rate, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity with microelectrodes in the peroneal nerve of the resting leg during 1) static handgrip at 15% and 30% maximal voluntary contraction and 2) attempted handgrip during partial neuromuscular blockade produced by systemic administration of tubocurarine chloride (0.075 mg/kg i.v.). During curare, subjects reported that they used near-maximal motor effort to attempt a sustained handgrip contraction, but they generated almost no force. Without sustained contraction, the intent to exercise alone, that is, central command, caused statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity as well as in arterial pressure and heart rate. However, the increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (+ 56 +/- 16% over control) and in mean arterial pressure (+ 12 +/- 2 mm Hg) during attempted handgrip were much smaller (p less than 0.05) than the sympathetic nerve response (+ 217 +/- 37% over control) and pressor response (+ 25 +/- 3 mm Hg) during an actual static handgrip at 30% maximal voluntary contraction. In contrast, heart rate increased as much during the attempted contraction (+ 18 +/- 2 beats/min) as during the actual contraction at 30% maximal voluntary contraction (+ 16 +/- 4 beats/min). In 11 additional subjects, the heart rate responses during curare were greatly attenuated (p less than 0.05) by atropine but were not significantly affected by propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Amiodarone has multiple pharmacological effects in heart. Electrophysiological data suggest that among its other effects, amiodarone is a sodium channel blocker. Using a radioligand assay, we determined whether amiodarone interacted with a previously described receptor for type I agents associated with the cardiac sodium channel. The radioligand was [3H]batrachotoxinin A 20 alpha-benzoate ([ 3H]BTXB), a toxin that binds to the activated state of the sodium channel. We have previously shown that class I antiarrhythmic drugs inhibit [3H]BTXB binding. The purpose of this study was to assess whether amiodarone and other class III agents interact with this receptor. Amiodarone inhibited [3H]BTXB binding in a dose-dependent fashion, with an estimated IC50 value of 3.6 microM. This IC50 value is similar to reported clinically effective serum concentrations of amiodarone. In contrast to amiodarone, the IC50 values for other class III drugs (bretylium, sotalol, bethanidine, N-acetylprocainamide) were much higher than their therapeutic concentrations and bore no relation to them. Scatchard analysis of [3H]BTXB binding showed that amiodarone reduced the maximal binding for [3H]BTXB; this finding indicates irreversible inhibition or (more likely) allosteric inhibition by amiodarone. The latter agrees with electrophysiological data suggesting that amiodarone binds to inactivated sodium channels. Sodium channel blockade by amiodarone may contribute to its overall electrophysiological effect.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate coupling between the heart and arterial system in normal subjects and cardiac patients, we determined both the slope of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ventricular elastance) and the slope of the arterial end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relation (effective arterial elastance) in three groups of subjects: group A, 12 subjects with ejection fraction of 60% or more; group B, seven patients with ejection fraction of 40-59%; and group C, nine patients with ejection fraction of less than 40%. We also determined the left ventricular stroke work, end-systolic potential energy, and the ventricular work efficiency defined as stroke work per pressure-volume area (stroke work + potential energy). In group A, ventricular elastance was nearly twice as large as arterial elastance. This is a condition for a maximal mechanical efficiency. In group B, ventricular elastance was almost equal to arterial elastance. This is a condition for maximal stroke work from a given end-diastolic volume. In group C, ventricular elastance was less than one half of arterial elastance, which resulted in increased potential energy and decreased work efficiency. Thus, the present study suggests that ventriculoarterial coupling is normally set toward higher left ventricular work efficiency, whereas in patients with moderate cardiac dysfunction, ventricular and arterial properties are so matched as to maximize stroke work at the expense of the work efficiency. Neither the stroke work nor the work efficiency is near maximum for patients with severe cardiac dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The mammalian myocardium responds to stretch by increasing both contractility and the release of atrial natriuretic peptide. These effects are observed in isolated perfused heart preparations as well as in vivo. That atrial natriuretic peptide release can be stimulated by activation of the phosphatidylinositol turnover pathway suggests a possible mechanism by which stretch might activate a biological response. Accordingly, experiments were performed to examine the effect of dilatation of the right atrium on the phosphatidylinositol turnover pathway measured in isolated perfused hearts. Dilatation of the right atrium caused a stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol turnover pathway as measured by an increase in the accumulation of inositol phosphates. In right atria, increases were detected after 1 minute of dilatation, and maximal increases were observed after 10 minutes. Dilatation for 10 minutes caused an increase in inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate from 23.3 +/- 0.9, 15.4 +/- 0.4, and 9.5 +/- 0.3 cpm/mg tissue (mean +/- SEM, n = 7) to 74.6 +/- 2.3, 20.2 +/- 1.3, and 13.6 +/- 1.5 cpm/mg tissue (n = 8), respectively (p less than 0.01 for all inositol phosphates). Smaller increases were observed in the other chambers of the hearts. Perfusion with propranolol, prazosin, and atropine (all 1 microM) did not alter the inositol phosphate response to dilatation, indicating that it was not secondary to release of norepinephrine or acetylcholine. Dilatation of the right ventricle also caused a stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation, but this was lower than after dilatation of the right atrium. These results show that the myocardium can respond to dilatation by an activation of the phosphatidylinositol turnover pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Furthermore, it was shown that the rate of the burst rises rapidly as a function of the actin concentration. Detailed modeling with the four-state model revealed that if the predicted Vmax is constrained to be approximately equal to the extrapolated value (double reciprocal plot) and if the apparent dissociation constant of subfragment-1 to actin divided by the apparent activation constant of the actin-activated myosin ATPase activity (Kbinding/KATPase) is constrained to be considerably different from one, then the model is unable to simultaneously account for the ATPase activity and the rate and magnitude of the initial inorganic phosphate burst.\r"

Regional myocardial stunning was produced in five open-chest dogs by eight to twelve 5-minute occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery, alternated with 10-minute reflow periods and followed by a final 60-minute period of reperfusion. Systolic segment shortening in the postischemic zone, measured by sonomicrometry, fell from 14.9% at baseline to -1.1% at the end of reperfusion. Sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from stunned myocardium demonstrated a 17% reduction in oxalate-supported 45Ca2+ transport compared with sarcoplasmic reticulum from normal myocardium (0.93 vs. 1.12 mumol Ca2+/mg protein/min, p less than 0.005). There was also a 20% decrease in the maximal activation by Ca2+ of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase (2.46 vs. 1.96 mumol Pi/mg protein/min, p less than 0.005), and a downward shift in the Ca2+-activation curve of the Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. These results indicate that myocardial stunning is associated with damage to the calcium-transport system of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Altered intracellular control may contribute to the inability of the stunned heart to maintain normal mechanical function.\r"

All were coroner-certified natural deaths and noncoroner-certified deaths due to vascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Autopsy data, coroner's reports, hospital records, physician's reports, and informants were used to validate diagnoses. The reviewers rejected 73 of 805 CHD certifications, but they validated 54 cases not certified as CHD on the death certificate as CHD. The CHD mortality rate fell from 90.6/100,000/year in 1970-1972 to 40.3/100,000/year in 1985-1986. Approximately two thirds of the decline was related to a decline in sudden deaths including 41.6% due to incident sudden CHD death. The proportion of diabetics among validated CHD deaths rose dramatically from 6.5% in 1970-1972 to 23.0% in 1985-1986. The CHD mortality rate among diabetics apparently did not decline during the 17 years of the study. We conclude that primary prevention has contributed substantially to the CHD decline in the 35-44-year age group. Better diagnoses and treatment, especially of angina pectoris and of patients after a myocardial infarction, may also have been important. Control of CHD in diabetics must take high priority in further prevention strategies.\r"

However, only a few previous studies have attempted subgroup analyses. In 4,796 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction, the time of symptom onset was recorded. As in other studies, the peak of onset occurred in the morning from 6:01 AM to 12:00 noon, and 28% of the population (1.16 times the average percentage for the other time periods) experienced symptom onset in that period (p less than 0.001). There was a second, lower peak (25%) in the evening between 6:01 PM and 12:00 midnight, which was also observed in some previous studies. We sought to determine whether or not the presence of subgroups with specific clinical characteristics would exhibit different patterns and thereby contribute to these peaks in the overall population. In patients with a history of congestive heart failure (n = 606) or with non-Q wave infarction (n = 832), a pronounced peak (29%) occurred only in the evening. Two nearly equal peaks were observed in patients older than 70 years of age (n = 1,422), smokers (n = 2,057), diabetics (n = 767), women (n = 1,213), and patients taking beta-blocking drugs (n = 847).

  ".W": "Nifedipine augments baroreflex mechanisms in in vivo animal models. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrate that nifedipine potentiates baroreflex control of heart rate and vascular resistance in normal human subjects. To further define the neuroeffector mechanism of the autonomic effects of nifedipine, we directly measured postganglionic sympathetic nerve activity to muscle (MSNA, microneurography), before and after drug administration, during selective unloading of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors with lower body negative pressure (-10 mm Hg, LBNP-10), and during the cold pressor test. Twenty-three normal subjects (age, 23 +/- 1 years; mean +/- SEM) were studied in the control state and 20 minutes after administration of either nifedipine (10 mg s.l., 10 subjects), during nitroprusside infusion (0.37 +/- 0.03 microgram/kg/min i.v., eight subjects), or 20 minutes after sublingual administration of placebo (five subjects). We measured systemic arterial pressure, central venous pressure, heart rate, and MSNA. Nifedipine and nitroprusside produced similar increases in resting heart rate and MSNA and similar decreases in central venous pressure, whereas placebo had no effect on resting hemodynamics. During LBNP-10, hemodynamic changes were not significantly different among the three treatment groups. However, the percentage increase in MSNA during LBNP-10 was significantly augmented from a 24 +/- 9% increase before nifedipine to a 56 +/- 7% increase after nifedipine (p less than 0.05). Decreases in central venous pressure with LBNP-10 were nearly identical before compared with after nifedipine. Thus, nifedipine increased the cardiopulmonary baroreflex sympathetic sensitivity (change in total MSNA per mm Hg decrease in central venous pressure during LBNP-10) from 26.5 +/- 10.7 units/mm Hg to 74.9 +/- 19.0 units/mm Hg (p less than 0.01). In contrast, administration of hemodynamically similar doses of nitroprusside resulted in an attenuation of MSNA responses to LBNP-10. During LBNP-10, MSNA increased 57 +/- 12% before nitroprusside but only 14 +/- 4% during nitroprusside (p less than 0.01). The cardiopulmonary baroreflex sympathetic sensitivity was not significantly altered by nitroprusside (45.1 +/- 12.4 units/mm Hg before compared with 33.1 +/- 20.8 units/mm Hg during nitroprusside, p = NS). Placebo had no effect on the responses to LBNP-10. Nifedipine did not augment MSNA responses to the cold pressor test. To evaluate the linearity of sympathetic responses to cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading, graded LBNP (0, -5, -10, and -15 mm Hg) was applied in three additional subjects before and after nifedipine (10 mg s.l.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism responsible for the attenuated heart rate (HR) response to exercise in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) was investigated in 46 normal subjects and 59 patients with CHF stratified by peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO2). The peak exercise HR and the increment in HR from rest to peak exercise were decreased in CHF patients, and both correlated strongly with peak VO2 (r = 0.810, p less than 0.0001; r = 0.863, p less than 0.0001, respectively). Peak exercise norepinephrine level (NE) and the increment in NE from rest to peak exercise were not attenuated in CHF patients. Resting NE was elevated in CHF patients and correlated inversely with peak VO2 (r = -0.595, p less than 0.001). However, no significant correlation occurred between peak VO2 and either peak exercise NE or the exercise increment in NE. The ratio of the exercise increments in HR and NE, and indirect index of sinoatrial node sympathetic responsiveness, was markedly reduced in CHF patients and was inversely related to the severity of exercise impairment. Likewise, the HR response to a graded isoproterenol infusion was markedly reduced in CHF patients. Age-matching of normal subjects and CHF patients did not affect the foregoing observations. Infusion of CHF patients with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone caused a significant increase in the ratio of the exercise increments in HR and NE. These data strongly suggest that the attenuated HR response to exercise in CHF patients is due, at least in part, to postsynaptic desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway.\r"

  ".U": "89324336\r", 
  ".W": "Our purpose was to characterize the excitable gap during atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) to elucidate the electrophysiologic substrate of this clinically familiar microreentrant arrhythmia. Accordingly, in 11 patients with classic slow-fast AVNRT (mean cycle length, 342 +/- 41 msec), a single ventricular extrastimulus (V2) was periodically delivered after a spontaneous tachycardia beat (V1) until ventricular refractoriness was reached. With this technique, an excitable gap was considered present when atrial preexcitation of at least 20 msec could be achieved along with tachycardia resetting (noncompensatory pause after V2). The range of V1V2 intervals that resulted in atrial preexcitation constituted the preexcitation zone. Five patients (45%) showed evidence of an excitable gap at baseline, with a maximal atrial preexcitation achievable of 33 +/- 6 msec, representing 9 +/- 1% of the tachycardia cycle length. Verapamil was then administered to all 11 patients with the purpose of slowing the anterograde tachycardia wavefront before arrival of V2. This resulted in widening of the preexcitation zone in three patients by a mean of 50 +/- 37 msec, with a corresponding increase in maximal atrial preexcitation to 70 +/- 32 msec, or 16 +/- 4% of AVNRT cycle length, and the appearance of atrial preexcitation in two patients who lacked it during baseline. In the remaining six patients, AVNRT was not sustained after verapamil or was too unstable for evaluation. During baseline, V2A2 conduction time increased by only 5 +/- 3 msec throughout the preexcitation zone, with values at the outer border unchanged after verapamil, implying a fully excitable gap in the retrograde limb. In all patients with a preexcitation zone, AVNRT was consistently reset by V2, both at baseline and after verapamil, with a \"flat\" but mainly \"increasing\" response pattern as V1V2 was shortened. Hence, a significant number of patients with AVNRT have evidence of an excitable gap whose demonstrability can be facilitated by pharmacologic intervention; documentation of an increasing resetting response pattern, most apparent after verapamil, provides new evidence for a reentrant mechanism in AVNRT; and while not definitively proven, the presence of a fully excitable gap during AVNRT is most consistent with a microreentry circuit that incorporates an anatomic obstacle.\r"

For each shift, 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure showed a large \"trough\" (the low pressure span) and a continuous range of elevated pressure (the high pressure span). Fourier series were used to model the 24-hour blood pressure profiles. A careful examination of the residuals (measured minus predicted pressures) showed that four harmonics were necessary to describe the data accurately. The model enabled localization in each blood pressure profile of the high and low pressure spans that did not coincide with the subject's work and rest periods. The time and slope of blood pressure entering and leaving these spans could also be individually determined. Mean blood pressure during the high pressure span was the same for the three shifts, but mean blood pressure during the low pressure span was lower when the subject worked in the afternoon. During that shift, the systolic blood pressure slopes entering and leaving the low pressure span were steeper than during the two other shifts. The high pressure span was longest during the night shift and shortest during the afternoon shift. Therefore, a change in the working time profoundly perturbed the 24-hour blood pressure profile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At rest, whole blood viscosity (corrected for hematocrit at both high and low shear rates), fibrinogen levels (4.23 +/- 1.39 vs. 3.23 +/- 1.5), and white blood cell count (7.05 +/- 1.25 vs. 6.03 +/- 1.28) were significantly different between patients and controls. After treadmill exercise, white blood cell counts increased in both patients and controls, whereas only the filterability of mononuclear leukocytes showed a significant variation in the patient group (5.47 +/- 1.54 vs. 7.26 +/- 2.00, p less than 0.002). In this group, mononuclear filterability improved during the recovery period. The results suggest a relation between exercise-induced ischemia of the lower limb and mononuclear filterability in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Mononuclear filterability could be a functional rheologic marker for peripheral vascular disease.\r"

Cox life-table univariate analysis correlated two echocardiographic, three Doppler, and three catheterization variables with poor survival (p less than or equal to 0.05), and chi 2 analysis ensured the best critical values: severity of pericardial effusion, heart rate of more than 87 beats/min, pulmonic flow acceleration time of less than 62 msec, tricuspid early flow deceleration (T-DEC) equal to or less than -300 cm2/sec, mitral early flow-to-atrial flow velocity ratio (M-E/A) equal to or less than 1.0, catheterization cardiac index (CI) equal to or less than 2.3 l/min/m2, mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 61 mm Hg, and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure of more than 43 mm Hg. Multivariate life-table analysis of noninvasive variables revealed the severity of pericardial effusion to be independently significant (p = 0.006), whereas analysis of catheterization variables revealed cardiac index to be independently significant (p = 0.014). Combined multivariate analysis did not differ from the noninvasive results alone. Categorical modeling of the eight significant variables split at their critical values (present or absent) revealed M-E/A, T-DEC, and CI to be independently significant by multivariate analysis (p = 0.0014). Analysis of the five echocardiography-Doppler variables alone revealed M-E/A, T-DEC, and heart rate to be independently significant (p = 0.0016).

Patients in medical cardiac arrest, managed by ACLS guidelines, underwent placement of aortic arch (Ao), jugular venous bulb (JVB), and right atrial (RA) catheters. Simultaneous pressures were measured, and intercatheter gradients were calculated. The JVB to RA pressure difference is the gradient between the cervical and central venous circulations. It was negative when averaged throughout the CPR cycle and was more negative during compression than relaxation, -19 +/- 12 and -2 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively. This indicates that the intrathoracic pressure rise was not transmitted to the jugular venous system, supporting the concept of a competent jugular valve mechanism during CPR. It is consistent with the thoracic pump model of cerebral perfusion. JVB to RA was positive only during early relaxation, allowing blood return from the head. The Ao to JVB gradient, although not equal to cerebral perfusion pressure, is the maximum potential pressure gradient for blood flow across the cerebral vasculature. It was positive throughout CPR, 25 +/- 17 during compression, and 9 +/- 10 mm Hg during relaxation. The Ao to RA gradient during the relaxation phase is CPR coronary perfusion pressure. In most patients, it was minimally positive in both phases of the CPR cycle: 7 +/- 14 in compression and 7 +/- 9 mm Hg during relaxation. This appears to be inadequate in providing sufficient blood flow to meet the metabolic needs of the myocardium. Four patients had larger gradients during compression suggestive of cardiac compression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was designed to examine whether or not the rate-dependent actions of diltiazem account for its therapeutic effects during atrial fibrillation. The determinants of the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation (concealed AV nodal conduction and AV node functional refractory period, AVFRP) were evaluated at multiple cycle lengths (with extrastimulus techniques) and during electrically induced atrial fibrillation (with indirect indexes from RR interval histograms) in anesthetized dogs. In the presence of diltiazem, AVFRP increased progressively relative to control as rate accelerated. At cycle lengths comparable to sinus rhythm in humans, AVFRP increased 10%, 17%, and 32% after doses 1, 2, and 3 of diltiazem, respectively. Drug-induced increases in AVFRP were greater at basic cycle lengths just above the Wenckebach point (17%, 48%, and 81%) and were maximal during atrial fibrillation (39%, 86%, and 154% increases for doses 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Diltiazem also increased the AV conduction system effective refractory period, thereby increasing the potential zone of concealment into the AV node. Frequency-dependent increases in the zone of concealment were produced by diltiazem and were associated with marked increases in the standard deviation of RR interval histograms during atrial fibrillation (257%, 526%, and 923% increases after doses 1, 2, and 3, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not influenced by dietary protein intake. Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), however, was significantly lower on the low protein diet (491 +/- 23 ml/min; mean +/- SEM) as compared to values on the high protein diet (538 +/- 19 ml/min; p less than 0.01). The increase of GFR after a meat meal (providing 1.8 g protein/kg body weight) was higher on the high protein diet (GFR: +23.6 +/- 5.1 ml/min) than on the low protein diet (GFR: +13.0 +/- 2.4 ml/min; p less than 0.05). We conclude that three weeks of dietary protein restriction do not decrease glomerular filtration rate and do not enhance the renal response to a meat meal. Therefore, it seems doubtful that dietary protein restriction decreases glomerular capillary pressure through vasoconstriction of the afferent glomerular arteriole. Furthermore, measurement of the renal hemodynamic response to an acute protein load seems of doubtful physiological significance.\r"

Arterial pressure fell significantly (p less than 0.01) during both the Control-HD (from 135 +/- 8/76 +/- 3 to 121 +/- 10/68 +/- 5 mmHg) and the Snack-HD (from 137 +/- 7/77 +/- 3 to 105 +/- 8/59 +/- 4 mmHg). The rate of fall, however, was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) after the snack than during the corresponding period in the control HD. Consequently, there were more hypotensive episodes requiring saline infusion during Snack-HD (23 in 10 patients) than during Control-HD (12 in 6 patients) (p less than 0.025). In spite of the greater number of interventions, the average fall in arterial pressure after a snack (-22 +/- 3/-13 +/- 2 mmHg) was more marked than during the corresponding period in the control-HD (-13 +/- 3/-9 +/- 2 mmHg). The hypotensive effect of snack was more pronounced in the presence of advanced autonomic neuropathy. Food ingestion impairs the arterial pressure response to UF in patients on RDT. Fasting during hemodialysis may in part prevent hypotension.\r"

  ".W": "In ergonomic and biomechanic research, estimations of shoulder muscle load and evaluation of different measuring techniques are important. Intramuscular pressure (IMP), using the microcapillary infusion technique and bipolar intramuscular electromyography (EMG), was recorded from the same part of the supraspinatus muscle. In 12 subjects, IMP and EMG were recorded at shoulder abduction angles of 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, and 135 degrees with no or a 1- or 2-kg hand load in each position. The shoulder torque was calculated for each test position. A correlation was found for both mean IMP and mean EMG versus shoulder torque if the position with extreme muscle shortening (135 degrees abduction) was excluded. IMP was high (greater than 50 mmHg) in almost all test situations. In seven other subjects, isometric force in abduction was correlated with IMP and EMG. Both methods showed an equally good correlation with external shoulder force, IMP gives as good an estimation of relative muscle force as EMG, but any comparison between EMG and IMP must be done at the same muscle length.\r"

None of the patients in this series was a candidate for proximal advancement of the forearm muscles. At the follow-up evaluation (mean, 31.5 months), the mean antigravity elbow flexion arcs obtained from each procedure were as follows: pectoralis transfer, 91 degrees; latissimus dorsi transfer, 87 degrees; free latissimus dorsi transfer, 11 degrees; and triceps-to-biceps transfer, 125 degrees. The results were equally favorable for the pectoralis and latissimus dorsi transfer. Triceps transfer was reliable for restoration of an excellent range of elbow flexion, but active elbow extension was lost. Poor results were obtained with the free latissimus dorsi transfers.\r"

One patient died prior to the one-year follow-up examination, and two others required revision in the immediate postoperative period. The remaining 14 primary total elbow arthroplasties in 11 patients were included in this study. There were eight women and three men with an average age of 58.1 years. The diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis in 12 patients and posttraumatic arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis each in one patient. Postoperatively, patients were immobilized in a long arm cast. The mean hospital stay was 4.3 days. At four weeks, the patients were seen for cast removal. Instructions were given for range of motion (ROM) exercises and patients were encouraged to resume normal daily activities as tolerated. No formal physical therapy was prescribed. The average follow-up period was 32 months. Preoperatively, the mean elbow motions were flexion 124 degrees, extension 34 degrees, pronation 65 degrees, and supination 44 degrees. At the last follow-up examination, ROM had improved significantly in all directions except extension (flexion 141 degrees, extension 36 degrees, pronation 77 degrees, and supination 61 degrees). There was one ulnar nerve palsy that only partially resolved. Another patient's elbow had initially subluxed due to excessive shortening of the humerus; however, he had an excellent ROM and was asymptomatic at 31 months. There were no dislocations or wound healing problems. Cast immobilization provides an effective means of promoting soft-tissue healing, permitting early discharge from the hospital and simplifying the postoperative rehabilitation while achieving satisfactory ROM without formal physical therapy.\r"

The disc is a strong fibrocartilaginous semicircular biconcave structure well adapted to its various functional roles. The length of the disc at its radial attachment varied between 12 and 20 mm (in most cases, 14-16 mm), and the width, measured between the apex and the radial base, varied from 7 to 14 mm, (in most cases, 9-11 mm). The thickness of the dorsal and palmar margins and the ulnar apex varied from 3 to 6 mm (in most cases, 4-5 mm), whereas the thickness of the central part varied from 0.5 to 3 mm (in most cases, 1 mm) and in a number of cases was perforated. Because the incidence of perforations increases progressively with the age of the subjects, the perforations were assumed to be degenerative in nature. Although the articular disc is a definable anatomic entity, it is intimately attached to surrounding elements to form a complex anatomic and functional structure.\r"

In this study, changes in the femoral medullary canal width in 30 patients with aseptic femoral loosening following primary THA were compared with 30 matched control patients. The rate of canal expansion on the operated side was twice that of the nonoperated side and four times that of the control. After the onset of symptoms in the failure group, the rate of femoral expansion of the operated side doubled. Iliac crest biopsies showed a decrease in male patients for osteoid surface and appositional and bone formation rates when compared with literature controls. These results suggest that femoral medullary canal expansion may be a factor in femoral component loosening following THA. The increased rate of canal expansion after the onset of symptoms demonstrates the need for early surgical intervention to avoid excessive bone loss.\r"

The average age of the patients (55 years) was younger than in many THA series. At the last follow-up assessment, 50 hips were classified as good or excellent, one as fair, and one as a poor result. No total hip component required revision. No acetabular components had migrated as judged by conventional roentgenographic examination, and only one hip had progressive radiolucencies around the acetabular component. No femoral component was rated definitely loose or probably loose, and only one was rated possibly loose. If long-term follow-up study confirms these preliminary results, the combination of a cemented femoral component with a cementless socket may prove to be of value for selected patients requiring THA.\r"

The rate of major complications was similar for both groups; however, trochanteric bursitis was more apparent in the anatomically nailed group. Eighty-nine percent of the fractures treated with anatomic nailing collapsed into a medially displaced position. Ninety-seven percent of anatomically nailed fractures in which the sliding compression screw was appropriately placed healed without complications. Satisfactory stability and healing occurred in both MDO and anatomic nailing groups. There was no demonstrated advantage of MDO over anatomic nailing using a sliding compression screw.\r"

Six methods to treat the infections were employed: antibiotics only, soft-tissue surgery, removal of the prosthesis, revision arthroplasty, arthrodesis, and amputation. Failure of the initial surgical treatment led to second revision surgery in 20 patients. At the follow-up examination, three patients (five knees) had died from septic complications and two patients had had above-knee amputation. Two of 32 patients had been successfully treated with antibiotics with no additional surgery. Four patients had successful soft-tissue surgery. Following removal of the prosthesis, the infection healed in four patients. In 12 of 19 patients (13 knees) with revision arthroplasty the infection healed, but only seven of these had functioning prostheses. The infection healed in all but one of the 21 patients with arthrodeses, and all but two were fused. Infected compartmental prostheses with good bone stock can be treated with an exchange arthroplasty using a two-stage procedure with tricompartmental revision prostheses. Otherwise, an arthrodesis using a two-stage procedure is recommended for the treatment of infected knee arthroplasty.\r"

Forty-four patients (46 knees) with dual-compartment disease from 1979 to 1984 were evaluated. Twenty-two patients were treated with 23 HTOs by a senior surgeon, and 22 were treated with 23 combined procedures by another surgeon. The two groups were matched according to age, sex, and preoperative clinical and roentgenographic disability. The minimum follow-up period was two years. All had more than 5 degrees valgus alignment at the follow-up evaluation, with an average of 11.2 degrees in the HTO group and 10.2 degrees in the combined osteotomy group. A modified Hospital for Special Surgery assessment (maximum, 100 points) was used with an optimum pain score of 30 points. All were followed roentgenographically with grading of the three knee compartments. In both groups, the total and pain scores improved significantly postoperatively. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of mean postoperative femorotibial shaft alignment or clinical and roentgenologic outcome. Although HTO was a good procedure for pain relief for dual-compartment disease, the addition of Maquet procedure did not improve the results.\r"

Patients were evaluated by questionnaire to assess subjective and functional status by clinical examination of objective findings, and by roentgenograms and instrumented ligamentous stability testing. The follow-up interval averaged 45.2 months for the entire group (range, 24-90 months). Using a 200-point scale, the rating for the group treated with intraarticular reconstruction alone was 169.1, while the average rating for the group treated with combined intraarticular and extraarticular stabilization was 166.2. Overall, an excellent or good result was obtained in 67% of patients in the intraarticular only group and in 70% of the patients in the combined reconstruction group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of changes seen on roentgenograms or in terms of residual laxity measured by instrumented testing. Thus, there is no demonstrable benefit derived from combined intraarticular and extraarticular stabilization procedures for chronic anterior cruciate ligament instability, provided that a well-placed intraarticular substitute of sufficient strength is functional.\r"

After fracture reduction and stabilization by a mechanical method of fixation or by a conservative method with a plaster cast, the rotational situation of the tibia can be determined before the patient leaves the operating room. Measurements can be performed under sterile conditions. The method was applied clinically and in a study of tibial torsion in normal adults.

The Genucom Knee Analysis System is marketed as a comprehensive quantitative knee joint laxity testing device. To examine the intrarater reliability of the Genucom, the authors evaluated five normal subjects, each on three independent occasions. All testing was done by a single examiner. Anteroposterior (AP) drawer, valgus/varus, and tibial rotation tests were performed. The average variability for repeated testing was determined and this variability was then used to estimate the smallest statistically significant difference for a single repeat examination that would represent true change, i.e., change over and above the inherent variability of the measurement. The results indicate that: (1) anterior drawer variability and tibial rotational variability are dependent on the knee flexion angle; (2) reporting anterior drawer may be more reproducible than reporting total AP motion; and (3) on average, changes exceeding 3 mm for anterior drawer tests, 5 mm for total valgus-varus motion, and 7 degrees-17 degrees of tibial rotation are needed to be 95% confident that the change in a measure from one time to the next is real and not due to measurement variability.\r"

There were no overcorrection problems in these ten feet. In the remaining 25 feet, the Baker-Hill procedure was done concurrently with other procedures, such as lengthening of the triceps surae (22 feet), calcaneal osteotomy (two feet), or plantar fascia release (two feet). The dynamic equinovarus deformity was corrected in all 25, but three subsequently developed a cavus deformity. This was probably caused by excessive weakening of the triceps surae rather than transposition of the posterior tibial tendon. Based on this study, anterior rerouting of the posterior tibial tendon seems to be a simple, safe, and generally effective procedure for correction of dynamic varus of the spastic hindfoot in children with cerebral palsy.\r"

In 34 of 59 silicone arthroplasties, cysts were noticed in the proximal phalanx after a mean follow-up period of 59 months. In the metatarsal head, cysts were seen in 40 cases. Histologic examination showed that the cysts were filled with an avascular cellular stroma containing histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells, opsonizing wear debris of the prosthesis. Because of this destructive process, caution is advised when using silicone prostheses in young, active people.\r"

To secure union in the presence of infection in cases not amenable to conventional treatment, intramedullary nailing combined with open wound management was the treatment in 19 fractures of infected tibial nonunions in 18 patients. Eighteen fractures united. Drainage lessened or ceased after union of fractures and/or removal of nails. Only three cases had bone grafts. All were initially Type III open fractures. The majority occurred in motorcycle accidents. Time to union averaged 6.6 months (range, three to 14 months). Fourteen cases (15 tibias) healed without further drainage; four had minimal but persistent drainage. In properly selected cases, the treatment was safe and effective.\r"

Dynamic and static scintigrams, using 99mtechnetium methylene diphosphonate, were obtained at zero, six, and 12 weeks after fracture. The data were analyzed according to the methods of recent workers in this field. Forty-one fractures united normally at 20 weeks and nine fractures developed delayed union. Analysis of results showed significant differences in uptake ratios, mean net counts, and an osteogenesis index between fractures with normal and delayed union. Of particular value was a ratio of uptake over the fracture site to an adjacent site in the same bone obtained at six weeks. A ratio greater than 2 indicated the potential to heal normally. The findings suggest that a single static scintigram at six weeks is strongly predictive of subsequent healing.\r"

Human osteoarthrotic articular cartilage specimens were removed during arthroplasty and examined using scanning electron microscopy. Craters and pits observed on the osteoarthrotic specimens were similar in appearance to those on the cavitated specimens. The mechanism of cavitation bubble collapse could be responsible for damage in vivo, thus providing articular cartilage with a degenerative pathway toward osteoarthrosis.\r"

Calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase are not useful as indicators of vitamin D deficiency, and vitamin D metabolites must be measured directly.

The overall nutritional status of this population may be reflected in their metabolic bone disease and small stature.\r"

The usefulness of additional evidence of adequate neural decompression from intraoperative somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) data was tested in 41 cases of a herniated intervertebral disc (27 patients) or spinal stenosis (14 patients). Postoperative observations at three weeks and three months were evaluated by intraoperative observation of decreased latency and/or increased amplitude of SEP recordings. In patients with unilateral or asymmetrical bilateral radiculopathy, the asymptomatic or less-affected leg acted as a control in the study. Successful function correlated significantly with intraoperative changes in latency toward normal in the more-affected leg, whether the lesion was herniated nucleus pulposus or spinal stenosis. Intraoperative physiological testing (SEP) is valuable for determining the adequacy of lumbar nerve root decompression and for the prediction of the successful relief of symptoms.\r"

The latter two patients eventually died of generalized disease, whereas the other five patients have no evidence of tumor after seven to 20 years. In the six patients in whom the spine was reconstructed using corticocancellous iliac bone, a block-vertebra was created by the grafts and the adjacent vertebrae, allowing two women to complete one or more pregnancies successfully. Sixteen patients were treated with removal of sacral vertebrae (from one-half S3, S4, and S5 to all). None of the seven patients treated with adequate surgery for a sacral chordoma has had a local recurrence. Two women have given birth to children after sacral amputations, one performed for rhabdomyosarcoma and the other for a huge ganglioneuroma. A patient treated with a hemicorporectomy for chondrosarcoma 18 years ago has no evidence of tumor.\r"

Group II fractures account for 10% of fractures of the clavicle and involve the clavicle lateral to the coracoclavicular ligament and are caused by direct violence. These injuries are divided into two subsets. Group II Type I fractures occur lateral to the coracoclavicular ligaments and are stable. Group II Type II fractures occur just medial to the coracoclavicular ligaments and are unstable. These latter injuries require stabilization. Group III fractures are uncommon and involve the medial end of the clavicle and are rarely caused by direct violence. Most fractures of the clavicle can be treated closed with excellent results. Open treatment is only occasionally indicated and then only under certain stringent conditions. Most complications occur with open treatment and include nonunion and infection. Neurovascular complications are uncommon but not unusual. Although reasonable shoulder function is compatible with surgical resection of the clavicle, it cannot be done with impunity.\r"

The optimum time for recording transepidermal water loss (TEWL) after the initial application of the probe to the skin (in vivo), and the best technique for optimizing the accuracy of measuring TEWL were determined. An evaporation device with a constant level of water loss was constructed for in vitro studies. The volar aspect of the right forearm skin of one subject was used in vivo. Both in vitro and in vivo measurements showed that there were some differences between the results of 4 of the 5 probes. The other probe was distinctly out of range. For all probes, the reproducibility of results of successive measurements was high. Stabilization of TEWL values was reached for all probes from 30-45 s after their initial application to the skin. It is recommended that TEWL be recorded for a further 30-s period, after the initial stabilization (45 s), and that this be taken as the true value. The manufacturer's recommended calibration procedure is based only on adjustments for the standard specified humidities and zero water loss. The importance of incorporating an additional calibration procedure which includes adjustments for an actual standard constant water loss is thus strongly stressed.\r"

The condition of the skin was evaluated by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements on the 1st day (before exposure, TEWL1) and on the 5th day of exposure (TEWL5), and by a visual scoring system. The TEWL5 value was strongly related to the TEWL1 value (R = 0.71). The influence of such factors as history of mucosal atopy, history of sensitivity to soap, dry skin, skin type, sex and age on the TEWL5 value was negligible. The baseline TEWL level (TEWL1) might be a reliable indication of an individual's susceptibility to weak irritants.\r"

Significant differences were found in cardiac index (CI) (4.07 +/- 0.25 vs. 2.98 +/- 0.25 L/min.m2) and oxygen delivery (DO2) (15.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 12.7 +/- 0.8 ml/min.kg) at 48 h between surviving and nonsurviving patients. Furthermore, an analysis of the relationship between DO2 and VO2 suggests a critical level of DO2 to be 15 ml/min.kg. Although no difference could be detected in initial arterial lactate concentrations, levels at 48 h were significantly different between survivors and nonsurvivors (2.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.5 mEq/L, respectively).\r"

All patients had undergone cardiopulmonary bypass for repair of congenital heart lesions. Plasma samples were obtained every 12 h while patients were receiving amrinone to determine when steady state was achieved; samples were also obtained within 24 h after amrinone had been discontinued. Elimination half-life (T1/2), clearance, and volume of distribution were calculated from plasma amrinone concentrations, and the incidence of platelet transfusion was monitored. T1/2(22.2 vs. 6.8 h) and clearance (1.1 vs. 2.6 ml/min.kg), but not the volume of distribution (1.8 vs. 1.6 L/kg), differed significantly in patients less than 4 wk of age in comparison to patients greater than 4 wk of age. A negative correlation between T1/2 and age (r = -.79) was observed. Platelets were administered no more frequently in study patients than in a similar group that did not receive amrinone. To achieve the plasma concentration of amrinone that is therapeutic in adults, current dosage recommendations are inadequate in neonates and infants. Infants should receive an initial iv amrinone bolus of 3.0 to 4.5 mg/kg in divided doses followed by a continuous infusion of 10 micrograms/kg.min, while neonates should receive a similar bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 3 to 5 micrograms/kg.min.\r"

Antacid administration was associated with a significant increase in diarrhea (p less than .01), as were the combined treatments of antacids and cimetidine (p less than .02).

All patients were treated with a 160-mg/m2 (4-mg/kg) loading dose followed by 80 mg/m2.h (2 mg/kg.h) x 24 h. There were no statistically significant changes in group mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate in response to the loading dose or infusion, although clinically significant changes did occur in four patients. Twenty-three patients had adverse reactions possibly related to naloxone, the most common of which were nausea (n = 20), bradycardia and/or hypotension (n = 3), myoclonus (n = 1), and hypertension (n = 1). Seven patients had naloxone discontinued for possible adverse reactions. All adverse reactions abated with discontinuation of naloxone and/or pharmacologic therapy when indicated. No deaths were attributable to naloxone treatment. High dose naloxone appears to be well tolerated in the majority of elderly patients with acute cerebral infarction.\r"

We examined whether epinephrine (EPI) or norepinephrine (NE) plasma concentrations could predict resuscitation outcome. In nine mongrel dogs, EPI and NE levels were drawn before cardiac arrest and after 8 and 14 min of cardiac arrest and CPR. Intravenous EPI (1 mg) was given 1 min before the last plasma level was drawn. Catecholamines were quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography with triple-electrode coulometric electrochemical detection. Plasma catecholamines increased significantly with cardiac arrest, EPI levels increased from a control level of 15.9 +/- 3.0 to 396.0 +/- 63.3 pmol/ml after 8 min of cardiac arrest (p less than .05), and NE levels similarly increased from 4.4 +/- 1.7 to 66.5 +/- 12.0 pmol/ml (p less than .01). Neither the absolute catecholamine plasma concentration nor the response to cardiac arrest of the endogenous catecholamine concentrations could predict outcome, but catecholamine responses to exogenous EPI did correlate with outcome. Animals which were subsequently resuscitated had a greater increase in the plasma EPI concentrations after exogenous EPI than animals that were not resuscitated, a 53-fold vs. a 23-fold increase (p less than .05). Successfully resuscitated animals also had increased NE levels after exogenous EPI, while unsuccessfully resuscitated animals had either no change or a decrease (p less than .02). Successfully resuscitated animals had an increase in coronary perfusion pressure (p less than .01) in response to exogenous EPI, in contrast to those that were not resuscitated. This suggests that the exogenous administration of EPI during prolonged CPR is beneficial despite markedly elevated endogenous catecholamine levels.\r"

Oxygen is added to the expired gas to replace the oxygen consumed by the patient. The replenishing oxygen flow equals the patients's VO2 when the mixed replenished expired oxygen fraction equals the inspired oxygen fraction. The accuracy of the Oxyconsumeter was assessed using a N2 and CO2 dilution technique. When tested over the operating range specified by the manufacturer, the bias of the Oxyconsumeter was 1.66% of reading. The reproducibility averaged 6.96% of reading. The reproducibility did not change with VO2, FIO2 or minute ventilation. The replenishment technique has the theoretical advantage that an absolute oxygen sensor calibration is not necessary and a respiratory flowmeter is not needed. It appears, from the laboratory testing, that the Oxyconsumeter has sufficient accuracy for use in the critical care setting.\r"

We evaluated a method of blood sampling from indwelling arterial lines that minimizes blood loss and eliminates the embolic risks associated with retrograde flushing. The values for PaO2, PaCO2, and pH obtained by the conventional sampling technique were compared to those obtained by a technique termed the \"three drop\" method. Thirty-five paired samples were obtained from patients in the pediatric ICU. Meaningful statistical and clinical correlations were observed for PaO2 (r = .97, p less than 10(-6], PaCO2 (r = .97, p less than 10(-6], and pH (r = .98, p less than 10(-6]. Evaluation for the slope of the regression line for each pair of variables was also significant (p less than 10(-6]. The means for each variable were also assessed. Only the PaCO2 values were different (t = 2.49, p less than .002). As the absolute value was 2 torr, we feel that there is no clinical significance to this finding. These data confirm that the three drop technique of sampling for arterial blood gas analysis is reliable. It also removes the risks of retrograde flushing and minimizes blood loss.\r"

The two impedance techniques were also compared in normal subjects. Seven healthy subjects and ten ICU patients were enlisted in the study. Three Q measurements were made in each subject. In the ICU patients, there were no significant differences in Q values as measured by TD (6.6 L/min), MIC (6.3 L/min), and NCCOM3 (6.4 L/min). Both MIC and NCCOM3 Q values were comparable to TD in patients. In normals, however, the NCCOM3 estimated larger values for Q than did the MIC (NCCOM3, 9.2 L/min; MIC, 6.2 L/min). Q values obtained with MIC in normals were comparable with published values for supine normals. Thus, the two techniques agreed in the patients but not in the normals. The reasons for these results are not obvious from the data, but are attributable to the measurements by the NCCOM3. Because of this, caution is suggested when interpreting absolute Q values obtained by the NCCOM3.\r"
