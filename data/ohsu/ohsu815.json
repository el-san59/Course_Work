  ".U": "90349759\r", 
  ".W": "Closure of large abdominal-wall defects usually requires the transposition of remote myocutaneous flaps or free-tissue transfers. The purpose of this study was to determine if separation of the muscle components of the abdominal wall would allow mobilization of each unit over a greater distance than possible by mobilization of the entire abdominal wall as a block. The abdominal walls of 10 fresh cadavers were dissected. This demonstrated that the external oblique muscle can be separated from the internal oblique in a relatively avascular plane. The rectus muscle with its overlying rectus fascia can be elevated from the posterior rectus sheath. The compound flap of the rectus muscle, with its attached internal oblique-transversus abdominis muscle, can be advanced 10 cm around the waistline. The external oblique has limited advancement. These findings were utilized clinically in the reconstruction of abdominal-wall defects in 11 patients, ranging in size from 4 x 4 to 18 x 35 cm. This study suggests that large abdominal-wall defects can be reconstructed with functional transfer of abdominal-wall components without the need for resorting to distant transposition of free-muscle flaps.\r"

  ".W": "This paper reports 11 cases of recurrence 10 years or more after primary treatment of clinically local cutaneous melanoma at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute. Using the product-limit method for estimating recurrence-free survival, two late recurrence rates have been calculated. The estimated late recurrence rate among all treated patients is 5 percent (95 percent confidence interval: 2 to 8 percent), and the estimated late recurrence rate for the group who survived the first 10 years without recurrence is 7 percent (95 confidence interval: 3 to 11 percent). No prognostic factors were found that could identify a patient subgroup significantly at risk of late recurrence. Recurrence-free survival curves show that most recurrences have presented by the end of 6 years, but later recurrences are seen, the latest in this series being 18.2 years following treatment. While patients probably do not require long-term follow-up in specialist clinics provided they are adequately educated in the nature of their disease, this paper shows the value of long-term statistical surveillance.\r"

An operator control group of 10 vessels without intimal abrasion had a patency rate of 100 percent immediately and at 24 hours. Ten vessels following single-dose heparin and intimal abrasion were all patent initially, with 7 remaining patent at 24 hours.

We present the report of a patient with an exceptionally aggressive tumour which extended outside the skull and emerged within the internal jugular vein. Bromocriptine induced only transient suppression of serum prolactin. In vitro studies of tissue from this prolactinoma showed that although prolactin secretion was reduced by both bromocriptine and dopamine, neither agent affected cytoplasmic levels of prolactin mRNA, suggesting relative autonomy of prolactin synthesis. We reviewed the progress of nine other patients with very large prolactinomas and serum prolactin levels greater than 100,000 mU/l. In three cases, treatment with bromocriptine rapidly reduced tumour size and serum prolactin levels became normal, but in the other cases responses were slower and less marked. Substantial amounts of residual pituitary tumour were seen in all cases where serum prolactin remained above 1000 mU/l, but also in one case where serum prolactin returned to normal, showing that serum prolactin levels are not reliable indicators of tumour size. Two patients died: one developed a CSF leak, and one pneumococcal meningitis in the absence of recognized CSF leakage. This emphasizes the significant morbidity associated with very large prolactinomas. The ideal long-term treatment of these tumours remains uncertain, but bromocriptine therapy alone is often inadequate. Cases of apparent bromocriptine resistance may reflect abnormal regulation of prolactin gene expression.\r"

Response was compared with an untreated control group of 28 patients (chronological age 12.5-17.5 years; bone age 7.0-13.0 years). Forty-four of 46 patients in the treatment group achieved genital stage 3 or 4 by the end of therapy; untreated patients either remained unchanged or advanced only one genital stage during this period. Testicular volumes increased from a median 4.5 ml (range 1-12 ml) to 9 ml (range 3.5-15 ml) in the treated patients. In untreated patients testicular volume increased from 6.0 ml (range 2-10 ml) to 9.5 ml (range 4-20 ml) over the same period. In patients initially growing at less than 7.0 cm/year height velocity increased from 3.9 cm/year (range 0-6.6 cm/year) to 12.7 cm/year (range 8.9-16.8 cm/year) during therapy, falling to 6.0 cm/year (range 0-12 cm/year) in the three-month period immediately following treatment. Patients initially growing at greater than 7.0 cm/year showed variable responses to treatment. Prepubertal patients showed the greatest acceleration in annual growth compared with controls. Treated patients with an initial skeletal age less than 12.0 years showed either a final height (when known) which was less than initially predicted or a significant reduction in predicted height following treatment. Skeletal age greater than 12.0 years was not associated with excess osseous maturation. In conclusion, pre-pubertal children growing at less than 7 cm/year show the greatest benefit from HCG therapy, but final height may be prejudiced if initial bone age is less than 12 years.\r"

Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block developed in 61 (8.6 per cent) patients and was more frequent in inferior (12.4 per cent) than anterior infarctions (4.9 per cent). A multiple logistic regression identified three factors which were independently correlated with block: inferior infarction, older age and larger infarct size as determined by cardiac enzymes. Mortality was 27.9 per cent in patients with block and 9.3 per cent in those without; it was significantly higher in both anterior (47.0 per cent vs 11.8 per cent) and inferior (20.4 per cent vs 6.7 per cent) infarction groups. When age, infarct size, infarct site and block were analysed simultaneously as predictors of death, block was a significant independent prognostic factor. The relative risk of death, corrected for age and infarct size, in patients showing block was similar for anterior and inferior infarction. Analysis of deaths revealed a higher incidence of unheralded death in inferior infarcts associated with high-degree block.\r"

Patients ranged in age from 11 months to 79 years with a mean age of 41 (+/- 23) years. Twenty patients had at least one first-degree relative with coeliac disease: a total of 25 of 861 relatives were affected (prevalence = 2904/100,000) compared with an expected 0.9 cases (prevalence = 100/100,000; p less than 0.001). Six relatives had inflammatory bowel disease (prevalence = 697/100,000) compared with an expected 1.3 cases (prevalence = 150/100,000; p less than 0.001). Five of these had ulcerative colitis, and one had Crohn's disease. The relative risk of ulcerative colitis is, therefore, five times greater for first-degree relatives of people with coeliac disease than for the general population (95 per cent confidence interval, 4.7-7.2). There is a clear association between coeliac disease and ulcerative colitis, which may point to factors involved in the aetiology of colitis.\r"

Sudden death was more frequent in patients with ventricular tachycardia or frequent ventricular ectopics, irrespective of the severity of heart failure (15 per cent (7-23 per cent) vs. three per cent (0-8 per cent) at two years). These findings suggest that patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and mild symptoms often have a benign clinical course.

It subsequently became clear that her symptoms were temporally related to sexual intercourse. After 8 hours she developed nasal congestion and urticaria followed by migratory arthralgia and periorbital oedema. Over the ensuing 24 hours she had diarrhoea, occasionally with blood. She became breathless and had evidence of a restrictive ventilatory defect. These symptoms improved over 4-5 days. Further in vitro investigations were inconclusive but intradermal skin testing with seminal plasma led to recurrence of all her symptoms. Symptoms ceased with condom usage, and the condition abated over 2 years. This patient is unique in that seminal fluid hypersensitivity appears to have produced a type III immune response.\r"

All possible cases from 1965-1987 were examined using the best case finding methods available. In a relatively stable population of about 1.92 million we identified 471 patients with 'possible' primary biliary cirrhosis and 347 with a definite, histologically confirmed, diagnosis. Prevalence rose from 18/1,000,000 in 1976 to 128.5/1,000,000 in 1987 (276/1,000,000 in women greater than 18 years). Increased awareness and availability of interested physicians seemed to be important contributing factors to the rise in prevalence. No important geographical clustering of cases was noted.\r"

Twenty patients at the stage of the acute illness were studied using a single blood sample for several hormone assays. None showed normal levels of all hormones measured. As acute severe illness can have a profound effect on the levels of these hormones, it is only possible to conclude that the results were compatible with although not diagnostic of anterior pituitary failure. Twelve survivors were assessed at eight to 226 weeks after envenoming, by hormone measurement in a basal sample, and a combined pituitary reserve function test with TRH, GnRH, and insulin hypoglycaemia. All but one showed some deficit in pituitary hormone secretion. Seven had already been started on thyroid replacement therapy or corticosteroids. Three survivors were assessed in the acute stage and later and each had similar findings on both occasions. Three survivors who were followed up and assessed with a combined pituitary reserve function test on two occasions had similar results each time. There was no sign of recovery. It seems that severe envenoming may be associated with anterior pituitary failure. Results from five autopsies showed that the lesion was haemorrhagic anterior pituitary necrosis. An additional mechanism may be direct action of the venom upon the function of anterior pituitary cells. We conclude that severely affected victims should be considered at risk of pituitary insufficiency.\r"

Twenty patients with evidence of B. capitatus were identified: 12 were infected, four were possibly infected, and four had evidence of B. capitatus colonization but were not infected by this fungus. Pulmonary infiltrates were seen in seven infected patients; four of these patients eventually developed mycetomalike cavitations. Eight infected patients presented clinical and radiologic features of focal hepatitis compatible with hepatosplenic candidiasis. Of the 12 infected patients, two did not receive any antifungal treatment and died, five did not show any response to systemic antifungal therapy, and five received prolonged amphotericin B plus 5-fluorocytosine therapy.

Thirty-eight non-AIDS patients with miliary tuberculosis seen since 1975 are reviewed. Their average age was 60 years. Two-thirds of the patients had comorbid conditions. Presenting symptoms were nonspecific; fever, anorexia, sweats, and weight loss were the most frequent. Fever, tachypnea, rales, and altered mental status were the most commonly associated signs. Chest radiographs often showed miliary disease, but the remainder of the laboratory abnormalities were nonspecific. Seventy-six percent of sputum cultures, 75% of gastric aspirate cultures, 59% of urine cultures, and 54% of bronchial washings were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Biopsy specimens, including those obtained by transbronchial biopsy, were frequently abnormal histologically but were rarely culture-positive. Mortality attributable to miliary tuberculosis was 21%. Risk factors for death included female sex and altered mental status. No patient treated initially with a regimen that included streptomycin died whereas 21% of those treated with other regimens died. These data confirm and extend the results of earlier studies and suggest that miliary tuberculosis is a disease of the elderly and immunocompromised and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion and diagnostic persistence are required for diagnosis.\r"

Cultures of purulent discharge from the salivary ducts of these patients revealed S. aureus in 53% and viridans streptococci in 31%. During the study period, only six nosocomial cases of ABP occurred out of 289,234 admissions. S. aureus was the organism isolated most frequently in the nosocomial cases. There were no deaths, and all patients recovered following antibiotic treatment without surgical drainage. Advances in antimicrobial therapy and fluid management of hospitalized patients have made nosocomial ABS a rare disease with a favorable prognosis. S. aureus remains the most common pathogen causing ABS even in nosocomially infected patients who are not critically ill.\r"

Etiologic agents included Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus fumigatus plus Blastoschizomyces capitatus, and Mucor (one case each). No pathogen was detected in the remaining three cases of pneumothorax. Four of the six patients died (7, 10, 27, and 50 days after the onset of pneumothorax). Two of the six patients with pneumothorax died of massive hemoptysis, whereas only one of the 40 patients who did not develop pneumothorax died of hemoptysis.

Complications associated with active valvular infection, such as neurologic sequelae, ring and annular abscesses, congestive heart failure, and splenic abscesses, are frequent. The overall morbidity and mortality remain high; however, outcome appears to improve with surgery. Our present data suggest that early valve replacement accompanied by a 6-week course of high doses of a combination of drugs may be the optimal therapy for left-sided pseudomonal endocarditis.

  ".W": "The five countries of Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) comprise 22.6 million inhabitants and rather homogeneous socioeconomic conditions. A survey of systemic Haemophilus influenzae diseases over the last decades revealed that the reported incidence of H. influenzae disease is increasing. In recent years, the overall incidence has been 3.5 cases per 100,000 people each year (800 cases annually); in children less than 5 years of age, the annual incidence has been 49 cases per 100,000. Meningitis represents only 52% of all systemic H. influenzae diseases, but lack of reliable data may obscure the importance of other entities. Few strains (less than 5%) are beta-lactamase-positive, and the case fatality rate is 3%. Analysis of seasonal variation shows peaks in June and September-October. If the efficacy of the H. influenzae conjugate vaccines were as high as that of a conjugate vaccine used in Finland during 1986-1987 (approximately 85% efficacy), then at least an 80% reduction in life-threatening H. influenzae infections would be achieved annually by routine immunization before or at the age of 6 months.\r"

Fecaliths were six times more common than calculi, but calculi were more often associated with perforated appendicitis or periappendiceal abscess (45 per cent) than were fecaliths (19 per cent). Appendiceal fecaliths and calculi appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis and are associated with complicated appendicitis (perforation and abscess). Appendectomy should be considered for patients in whom an appendiceal calculus is recognized incidentally.\r"

However, the ability to localize tumors preoperatively to particular segments within the liver has not been emphasized. The large size of this organ and its complex vascular structure have not allowed the surgeon either to determine accurately the hepatic segment occupied by the tumor or to identify major vascular structures adjacent to the tumor. We have expanded the use of a new roentgenologic technique to determine preoperatively with more clear definition the segmental anatomy of the liver. Computerized tomographic portography (CT-P) images hepatic veins and the segmental branches of portal vein and identifies the anatomic location of tumor nodules. To read the roentgenograms, one first identifies the middle CT-P slice that will cut the transverse scissura. Slices cephalad to the transverse scissura are through segments 7, 8, 4a and 2 in a clockwise order; slices caudad to the transverse scissura are through 6, 5, 4b and 3. Selected CT-P cuts from a series of patients show the typical CT-P configuration of the hepatic vasculature anatomy and the structures that can be identified roentgenologically. The CT-P provides valuable information not previously available preoperatively to the surgeon operating upon the liver.\r"

The technique of selected arterial secretin stimulation is one of measuring variations in gastrin levels in both the hepatic vein and a peripheral artery at specified times after injection of secretin into a specific artery. When the criteria for localization have been met, one can plot the presence of the gastrinoma within the blood supply of the injected artery and, using angiograms, thus accurately localize the lesion. This method promises to be a valuable additional tumor-localizing procedure, particularly when gastrinomas are extrapancreatic.\r"

Seven patients were diabetic, ten were hypertensive and six had prior vascular surgical treatment. The operative arteriograms confirmed vascular occlusive phenomenon. The ankle to brachial ratio was a mean of 0.02. Perioperatively, patients had anticoagulation with heparin systemically. All patients underwent transfemoral embolectomy using a Fogarty catheter. An initial retrieval of clots was accomplished, with documentation by arteriography, instillation of urokinase (50,000 units) and clamping of vessel for 15 minutes. Subsequent passage of the Fogarty catheter and repeat urokinase infusion resulted in further retrieval of clots and improvement by repeat intraoperative arteriography. All interventions resulted in clinical restoration of perfusion to the affected limb. Six patients had amputations of the lower extremities (one transmetatarsal and one below the knee) during the 30 day postoperative period. Improvement in distal run-off was demonstrated by intraoperative arteriography and increases in the ankle to brachial ratio from 0.1 to 1.04, with a mean of 0.54, were noted. No complications from bleeding occurred. One patient died postoperatively because of myocardial infarction. Salvage of the limb may increase with combined embolectomy and thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Two studies from the 1950s examined the reverse questions to determine the prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal stones. This report examined 1,500 consecutive patients treated by lithotripsy seen at the Georgetown University Medical Center and found, using the historical criterion for diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism (a serum calcium level of 10.5 milligrams per deciliter or greater) that the prevalence had decreased significantly from 8.0 per cent to our level of 3.02 per cent. Neither age nor sex contributed significantly to this decrease, and there were significantly more calcium stones than in the previous studies. Using an elevated calcium level with an elevated chloride to phosphate ratio as criteria for a diagnosis of probable primary hyperparathyroidism, a true prevalence of 1.65 per cent (+/- 0.6 per cent) was found. We believe that there has been a significant decrease in the frequency of primary hyperparathyroidism in the general population of patients with renal stones.\r"

Important peripartum maternal complications were no more frequent in women aged 35 years or more than in women 20 to 34 years old, although operative delivery was significantly more common. Similarly, adverse outcomes of infants were no more frequent. Perinatal mortality tended to be lower. In addition, we noted a trend for fewer infants with congenital anomalies to be born among older women. This trend was related, in part, to the choice to terminate the pregnancy by women with fetuses that had documented chromosomal anomalies. We conclude that advanced maternal age was not associated with an excess of adverse pregnancy outcome and suggest that, with early registration and careful surveillance during pregnancy, women aged 35 years or more can experience excellent pregnancy outcomes.\r"

The mean hemoglobin and hematocrit levels on admission and discharge were identical for both groups. Patients receiving desmopressin required less than one-half the number of autologous transfusions than the control group. Desmopressin was effective in reducing blood loss in operations in which intraoperative bleeding was greater than 1,000 milliliters, but it is probably not necessary for anticipated losses less than this amount. It may have a role in operations performed on short notice when autologous blood is usually unavailable.\r"

False-positive rates, that is, nonvisualization, of 10 to 38 per cent have been reported in patients with factors associated with nonfilling of the gallbladder, such as prolonged fasting and the administration of total parenteral nutrition, pancreatitis, alcoholism or other critical illnesses. The administration of morphine sulfate increases resting pressure of the common bile duct because of constriction of the sphincter of Oddi, and increases the likelihood of gallbladder visualization. We administered morphine sulfate (0.05 to 0.1 milligram per kilogram given intravenously) to 68 patients (including 25 critically ill patients) suspected of having biliary sepsis and who demonstrated nonvisualization of the gallbladder by RC at 30 to 60 minutes. Visualization of the gallbladder occurred within 60 minutes after the administration of morphine sulfate in 38 patients and within 30 minutes in 36 of the 38, aiding in exclusion of the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in 37 patients. Acute cholecystitis was confirmed by laparotomy in 28 of the remaining 31 patients. There were two false-positive and one false-negative scans, yielding a sensitivity rate of 97 per cent, a specificity rate of 95 per cent, positive and negative predictive values of 0.93 and 0.97, and an accuracy of 96 per cent for this investigative procedure. We conclude that administration of morphine sulfate in conjunction with RC in seriously ill patients enhances the reliability of this test.\r"

The pressure on the surface of the brain decreased 50% in 5 minutes even though the position of the retractor was maintained constant. The authors postulate that monitoring cerebral pulsation may prove useful in clinical neurosurgery with respect to avoiding excessive retraction, which causes brain damage.\r"

Fourteen (93.3%) of the 15 patients improved in the post-operative period. Low local cerebral blood flow in the ischemic area without infarction manifested a constant and significant increase postoperatively.

Of these, 220 patients (9.0%) had documented neck fractures from diving accidents, representing the largest series of acute diving injuries yet analyzed. The average age of these patients was 21 years, and males predominated. Two hundred twelve patients (96.4%) were admitted within 48 hours of injury. Associated injuries were rare: none had intracranial mass lesions or systemic injuries, and only nine were near-drowning victims who required endotracheal intubation. The most common levels of injury were C-5 (140 fractures) and C-6 (85 fractures), with 70 patients having fractures at more than one level. Neurological injury was sustained in 154 (70.0%) patients, while 66 (30.0%) patients were neurologically intact. One hundred forty-seven (66.8%) patients underwent posterior cervical fusion, and anterior fusion was performed in 36 (16.4%), allowing for early ambulation and an average hospital stay of 17 days. Hospitalization was relatively uncomplicated, with urinary tract infection in 121 (55.0%), pneumonia in nine (4.1%), and deep vein thrombosis in 24 (10.9%). Long-term follow up averaged 5 years and was obtained in 160 (72.7%) patients. Sixteen (10.0%) improved neurologically, five (3.1%) deteriorated, and 139 (86.9%) were unchanged. Notably, this large study shows that diving accidents occur in a young, healthy population who sustain essentially no other associated intracranial or systemic injuries and have few serious hospital complications. Such patients may be mobilized early in their care after either internal or external stabilization. Subsequent long-term neurological improvement can be expected to occur in about 10% of patients. The importance of water safety and injury prevention is stressed.\r"

  ".W": "In exposing deep extracerebral or paraventricular lesions, it sometimes may be preferable to resect a small amount of noneloquent brain tissue rather than retract the brain. This may be the case in carefully selected instances when, in the surgeon's estimate, brain retraction may result in significant parenchymal damage, in aneurysmal rupture, or in damage to important bridging veins. Some surgical approaches involving brain resection have been well described. This technical note discusses the following approaches that, though undoubtedly used by many surgeons sporadically, have received less formal attention: (1) anterior-inferior temporal resection for basilar aneurysms, (2) posterior-inferior temporal resection to approach the posterior incisura and avoid damage to the vein of Labbe, (3) parahippocampal resection to expose the posterior cerebral artery in the ambient cistern, (4) paramedial posterior parietal incision to approach the trigone of the lateral ventricle, (5) parasagittal resection to expose the interhemispheric fissure and avoid damage to bridging veins, (6) cingulate resection for pericallosal aneurysms, and (7) tonsillar resection for aneurysms of the peripheral portion of the posterior-inferior cerebellar arteries.\r"

This study examines the disease-related effect, if any, of perioperative blood transfusions among 108 patients with localized carcinoma of the prostate treated by radioactive iodine-125 seed implantation of the prostate and lymphadenectomy. When all subjects were analyzed, there was no statistical difference of local and distant failure between the transfused and nontransfused groups. Patients with well-differentiated tumors had statistically fewer local recurrences (0% vs 22%, p = 0.036) if they were transfused perioperatively. However, the difference in distant metastases (0% vs 11%) was not statistically significant (p = 0.21). In contrast, patients with moderately and poorly differentiated disease receiving transfusions had more local recurrences and metastases, though this was not statistically significant. Our data suggest that there is no obvious evidence that perioperative blood transfusions have an adverse effect on local recurrence or distant metastases for iodine-125 seed implantation of carcinoma of the prostate.\r"

Ten of the patients had metastases limited to the brain and 12 also had extracranial metastases. Twenty patients received external radiotherapy. Five had craniotomy after failing radiation therapy and 15 had adjuvant radiotherapy. Two patients died within thirty days following craniotomy; the median survival of the remaining 20 patients was 20.9 +/- 6.8 months calculated according to a Weibull survival model. Variables examined in relation to survival included absence or presence of extracranial metastases at time of craniotomy, time interval between nephrectomy and diagnosis of cerebral metastases, neurologic status prior to craniotomy, location of the brain tumor, and patient age. None of the variables was significant at the 10 percent level by the Weibull analysis. However, three favorable prognostic factors, namely metachronous brain metastasis more than one year after nephrectomy, minimal or no neurologic deficit at time of craniotomy, and infratentorial lesions show a trend toward improved survival with p less than 0.20. The data suggest that surgical resection of a single and occasionally multiple brain metastases is warranted in selected patients with renal cell carcinoma.\r"

The posterior relationship between Gerota's fascia and the transversalis fascia overlying the more posterior psoas muscle can be used to advantage in exposing the renal vessels posteriorly. That the fascial layers defining the retroperitoneal spaces might therefore be used in dissecting the renal hilum and vessels in the performance of radical nephrectomy prompted the present investigation. Twenty patients underwent this approach for radical nephrectomy for varying stages of renal cell carcinoma involving either upper, mid, or lower portion of right or left kidney. Postoperative recovery appeared to be shortened because of the lesser interval of ileus than had previously been encountered using a transperitoneal approach. Despite the minimal manipulation of the kidney prior to ligation of the renal vessels, there was no apparent increased tumor dissemination as detected clinically, and experimentally there appeared to be no increase in tumor cells in the venous effluent. Operative time, blood loss, and postoperative complications were comparable to those reported for the transperitoneal approach. This means of performing radical nephrectomy, based on the relationship of fascial layers in the retroperitoneum thus appeared to lend itself to easier dissection as well as lesser postoperative ileus and corresponding shorter hospital stays.\r"

Additional factors associated with incontinence in females are: history of parent and sibling incontinence, incontinence either during pregnancy or postpartum, hearing problems, use of female hormones, and vaginal infections. Incontinence among males is associated with vision problems and a history of and symptoms of cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest urinary incontinence is part of a complex and multifactorial problem. Further studies are needed to confirm and explain these findings.\r"

During voiding there was a distal urethral narrowing along with a proximal one seen in several patients and a synchronous decrease in urinary flow rate (peak and average flow) in the majority of patients. This functional urethral obstruction should be named \"painful urethral syndrome\" and not prostatodynia and may be only a step in a chain of events leading finally to chronic nonspecific prostatitis.\r"

The prevalence of antisperm antibodies in the infertile population is approximately 10 percent, and it is not cost-effective to test for these antibodies in every male partner of an infertile marriage. Earlier studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of antisperm antibodies among men with a history of bacterial prostatitis or urethritis. Because of this established association, we measured the prevalence of serum antisperm antibodies, using a gel agglutination assay, in 28 men with chronic nonbacterial prostatitis and in age-matched control group of 69 men without a history of prostatitis. The prevalence was 25 percent (test subjects) and 7.2 percent (controls) (p less than 0.05). This finding indicates that nonbacterial prostatitis is a risk factor for the presence of serum antisperm antibodies and that subfertile men with a history of nonbacterial prostatitis should be tested for these antibodies.\r"

Of 8 patients with fistula, there was no recurrence, and 3 procedures were performed without urinary diversion or urethral stent. Of 15 patients with hypospadias, there was no fistula formation in the original urethral opening area but a fistula distal to the original urethral opening developed in 3 patients. This technique is satisfactory in repairing complicated as well as noncomplicated urethrocutaneous fistula and can be done without urinary diversion or urethral stent. It appears to be useful in reducing fistula formation following urethroplasty in hypospadias or urethral fistula repair.\r"

The characteristic filling curve to the point of bladder contraction seen clinically during cystometry in the neurologically intact subject can be reproduced in isolated bladder muscle strips. The bladder function of storage is a result of passive smooth muscle properties of muscle length and tension which can, however, be altered by superimposed neurologic influences.\r"

Compared with a 12-lead electrocardiogram, the best single lead for detecting ST change during PTCA in each artery had a sensitivity of 80% and this increased to 93% using the best 2 leads. The best 3 leads (V3/III/V5 for left anterior descending and III/V2/V5 for right coronary and left circumflex) increased sensitivity to 100%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess whether these segments may represent reversible ischemia, reinjection thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed after stress and 3-hour delayed imaging in 24 patients before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The left ventricular myocardium was divided into 5 myocardial segments and regional wall motion was scored on a scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (dyskinesia). Thallium-201 findings were compared with improvement in regional perfusion and wall motion 1 to 2 months after CABG. The reinjection imaging identified new redistribution in 15 of 32 persistent defects (47%) on the 3-hour delayed images. In the study of stress and delayed SPECT imaging, the improvement in perfusion was observed in 34 of 43 segments (79%) exhibiting redistribution and 15 of 32 (47%) segments without redistribution (p less than 0.01). The reinjection SPECT identified new redistribution in 12 of the 15 improved segments that were not detected on the delayed images. Similarly, the improvement in wall motion was observed in 23 of 31 segments (74%) exhibiting redistribution and 14 of 30 segments (47%) without redistribution on the delayed images (p less than 0.05). The reinjection identified new redistribution in 10 of the 14 improved segments that were undetected on the delayed images. The predictive values for improvement in perfusion and wall motion by the reinjection imaging were significantly higher (92 and 89%) than those by the delayed imaging (69 and 62%, respectively, p less than 0.05 each).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The relative contributions of afterload reduction or prevention of myocardial ischemia were assessed using load-independent global (peak-systolic pressure/end-systolic volume) and regional (peak-systolic pressure/end-systolic radial length) \"contractile\" indexes. Nisoldipine decreased aortic pressure (predrug, 109 +/- 14 vs postdrug, 88 +/- 13 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and prevented elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during rapid atrial pacing (predrug, 7.9 +/- 5.7 vs postdrug, -0.5 +/- 4.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Resting cardiac index (predrug, 3.3 +/- 0.6 vs postdrug, 4.2 +/- 0.7 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction (predrug, 68.1 +/- 9.0 vs postdrug, 74.2 +/- 9.4%, p less than 0.05) increased after nisoldipine, which also prevented the deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction (predrug, -8.1 +/- 7.9 vs postdrug, -1.0 +/- 3.7%, p less than 0.05) and fractional radial shortening (predrug, -8.7 +/- 13.1 vs postdrug, 3.7 +/- 16.4%, p less than 0.01) during rapid atrial pacing. Under these conditions, nisoldipine preserved myocardial function, as determined by global peak-systolic pressure/end-systolic volume (predrug, -0.82 +/- 0.39 vs postdrug, 0.17 +/- 1.54 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.05) and regional (peak-systolic pressure/end-systolic radial length, predrug, -23.8 +/- 36.1 vs postdrug, 12.7 +/- 36.3 mm Hg/cm, p less than 0.01) \"contractile\" indexes.

  ".W": "Preoperative dipyridamole-thallium-201 scanning is sensitive in identifying patients prone to ischemic cardiac complications after vascular surgery, but most patients with redistribution do not have an event after surgery. Therefore, its positive predictive value is limited. To determine which patients with thallium redistribution are at highest risk, dipyridamole-thallium-201 images were interpreted semiquantitatively. Sixty-two consecutive patients with redistribution on preoperative dipyridamole-thallium-201 planar imaging studies were identified. Each thallium scan was then analyzed independently by 2 observers for the number of myocardial segments out of 15, the number of thallium views out of 3 and the number of coronary artery territories with redistribution. Seventeen patients (27%) had postoperative ischemic events, including unstable angina pectoris, ischemic pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction and cardiac death. Thallium predictors of ischemic operative complications included thallium redistribution greater than or equal to 4 myocardial segments (p = 0.03), greater than or equal to 2 of the 3 planar views (p = 0.005) and greater than or equal to 2 coronary territories (p = 0.007). No patient with redistribution in only 1 view had an ischemic event (0 of 15). Thus, determining the extent of redistribution by dipyridamole-thallium-201 scanning improves risk stratification before vascular surgery. Patients with greater numbers of myocardial segments and greater numbers of coronary territories showing thallium-201 redistribution are at higher risk for ischemic cardiac complications. In contrast, when the extent of thallium redistribution is limited, there is a lower risk despite the presence of redistribution.\r"

Six lead system complications were observed during a follow-up period of 51 +/- 36 weeks. Three catheter electrode conductor fractures occurred and manifested as oversensing and subsequent delivery of inappropriate shocks (1 patient), inability to defibrillate during electrophysiologic testing 3 months after implant (1 patient) and sudden cardiac death (1 patient). Asymptomatic patch electrode conductor fractures were detected on a routine chest roentgenogram in 2 patients. Endocardial defibrillation threshold testing performed at the time of implantation resulted in malfunction of a previously implanted permanent pacemaker pulse generator in 1 patient. Catheter and patch electrode replacement procedures were performed in 3 consenting patients under local anesthesia. Endocardial defibrillation thresholds after lead replacement were comparable to those obtained at time of initial implant. Serial clinical, roentgenographic and electrophysiologic evaluation should be included in follow-up procedures for endocardial defibrillation lead systems. Monitoring for deleterious effects of endocardial defibrillation threshold testing on previously implanted pacemaker systems should be performed at the time of implant and during follow-up. Improved lead designs are necessary for long-term use of endocardial defibrillation electrodes, but replacement procedures are feasible without thoracotomy.\r"

  ".W": "The evoked potential, the intracardiac signal generated by a pacing stimulus, shows promise as a sensor for rate-responsive pacing and automatic threshold determinations. Thus, it is important to understand factors that may alter the morphology of evoked potentials and affect accurate signal analysis. Using a computer-based pacing system emulator, stimuli at 2.5, 5.0 and 6.9 V were delivered to 12 patients through permanent bipolar pacing leads. At 2.5 V, the evoked potential amplitude measured -12.63 +/- 7.79 mV. When the pacing amplitude was increased to 5.0 and 6.9 V, the signal diminished in size or reversed in polarity, or both, averaging -0.83 +/- 7.82 mV and 0.64 +/- 7.0 mV, respectively (p less than 0.01 vs 2.5 V). Pacing at 2.5 V was performed in an additional 8 patients with temporary quadripolar electrode catheters. With the distal pole of the catheter as the cathode and the proximal 3 poles as a common anode, the evoked potential averaged -9.01 +/- 5.44 mV. With the proximal 2 poles of the catheter disconnected to make the anode equal in size and current density to the cathode, the evoked potential diminished to -0.94 +/- 11.27 mV (p less than 0.05). There is thus a decrease in the evoked potential at high stimulus amplitudes compared to that obtained at the cathodic threshold. This finding can be reproduced by manipulation of the size and current density of the anode, suggesting that anodal stimulation at the ring of permanent pacing leads may be responsible.\r"

Of 397 patients treated with quinidine, 184 (46%) developed adverse effects during the first 2 weeks of therapy and were given no further antiarrhythmic therapy. Of 9 patients treated with procainamide, 2 (22%) developed adverse effects during the first 2 weeks of therapy and were given no further antiarrhythmic therapy. Adverse effects developed during long-term therapy in 6 patients (2%) receiving quinidine and in 3 patients (33%) receiving procainamide. Mean follow-up was 24 +/- 15 months in both groups. Sudden cardiac death, total cardiac death and total death occurred in 21, 43 and 65% of patients receiving quinidine or procainamide, respectively, and in 23, 44 and 63% of patients receiving no antiarrhythmic drug, respectively (difference not significant). Survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference between the 2 groups for sudden cardiac death, total cardiac death or total death through 4 years. Patients with abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction had a 3.4 times higher incidence of sudden cardiac death, a 2.4 times higher incidence of total cardiac death and a 1.4 times higher incidence of total death than patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction. These data showed no significant difference in sudden cardiac death, total cardiac death or total death between patients treated with quinidine or procainamide or with no antiarrhythmic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Effective reduction in mitral gradient was initially achieved in 7 patients. For the entire group, mean valve gradient decreased from 14.8 +/- 5.0 to 8.1 +/- 6.7 mm (p = 0.0007) and mean valve area increased from 1.1 +/- 0.5 to 1.8 +/- 0.9 cm2/m2 (p = 0.003). More than mild mitral regurgitation developed in 2 patients but none required surgery for mitral regurgitation. Poor gradient relief followed dilation of valves with unbalanced chordal attachments, with restriction to the valve apparatus as in mitral arcade, and where the obstruction was not purely valvar as it is with a supramitral ring. No strokes, infection or deaths were due to the procedure. Based on these data, balloon angioplasty of congenital mitral stenosis should be considered before mitral valve replacement in younger patients and in those in whom mitral valve replacement would be problematic.\r"

  ".W": "Electrocardiographic left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy involving ST-T abnormalities, in addition to high QRS voltages, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. Unfortunately, conventional electrocardiographic criteria have limited utility in the quantitative assessment of LV hypertrophy. Body surface potential maps, which contain diagnostic information not present in commonly used lead systems, were recorded from 117 thoracic sites and 3 limb electrodes in 72 normal subjects and 84 patients with LV hypertrophy. Multiple regression analysis was performed separately for 54 women and 102 men on 120-lead data, using as features instantaneous voltages on time-normalized P, PR, QRS and ST-T waveforms. Leads and features for optimal prediction of echocardiographically determined LV mass were selected. A total of 6 features from 3 torso sites in men, and from the same 3 sites plus 2 others in women, yielded correlations between echocardiographic and electrocardiographic estimates of LV mass of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. The standard errors of the estimate (SEE), or average errors in predicting LV mass from the regression equations, were 31 and 22 g, respectively. The single most potent predictor in both sexes was a mid-QRS voltage measured on a lead positioned 10 cm below V1; QRS duration, late QRS and early-to-mid T-wave amplitudes recorded in the lower left flank contributed significantly to the performance of both regression models. The optimal electrode sites for electrocardiographic prediction of LV mass were outside the conventional lead locations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Expiratory and inspiratory IVC diameters and percent collapse (caval index) were measured in subcostal views within 2 cm of the right atrium. Parameters were correlated with RA pressure by flotation catheter within 24 hours of the echocardiogram (38 were simultaneous). Correlations between RA pressure (range 0 to 28 mm Hg), expiratory and inspiratory diameters and caval index were 0.48, 0.71 and 0.75, respectively. Of 48 patients with caval indexes less than 50%, 41 (89%) had RA pressure greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation, 15 +/- 6), while 30 of 35 patients (86%) with caval indexes greater than or equal to 50% had RA pressure less than 10 mm Hg (mean 6 +/- 5). Sensitivity and specificity for discrimination of RA pressure greater than or equal to or less than 10 mm Hg were maximized at the 50% level of collapse. Thus, IVC respiratory collapse on echocardiography is easily imaged and can be used to estimate RA pressure. A caval index greater than or equal to 50% indicates RA pressure less than 10 mm Hg, and caval indexes less than 50% indicate RA pressure greater than or equal to 10 Hg.\r"

This decision challenges the contemporary practice of obstetrics and threatens to curtail access to needed services, particularly for poor women, who are at highest risk of pregnancy-associated medical complications and death. Governmental restrictions on abortion interfere with the obstetrician's basic goal of providing optimal care for the patient. Obstetricians dedicated to providing the best care to their patients should help to ensure that safe abortion be part of a spectrum of reproductive health care that is available to all American women.\r"

  ".W": "During the 18-year period from 1971 through 1988, 37 women whose pregnancies were complicated by moderate or severe renal insufficiency were managed at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Common maternal complications included anemia, chronic hypertension, and preeclampsia. Perinatal complications included midpregnancy losses and low birth weight from preterm delivery, fetal growth retardation, or both. Despite the high incidence of maternal morbidity, 85% of pregnancies in the 26 women with moderate renal insufficiency resulted in a live-born infant; there was one stillbirth and no neonatal deaths. Of the 11 women with severe disease, seven were delivered of live-born infants after greater than or equal to 26 weeks' gestation. Although six of these 37 women had worsening renal function during pregnancy, it seems unlikely that pregnancy per se caused this. More importantly, in four of these six women and in four others who had stable function throughout pregnancy, end-stage renal disease developed within a mean of 4 years after delivery. In 14 women blood volume was determined during pregnancy, and whereas those with moderate disease had normal volume expansion, women with severe disease had significantly attenuated expansion. Finally, serial creatinine clearances did not increase during pregnancy in half the women with moderate insufficiency and none with severe dysfunction.\r"

To derive national rates of preeclampsia and eclampsia and to characterize the women at highest risk of the development of these conditions, we analyzed data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey for the years 1979 through 1986. We found that 26 per 1000 births during this period were complicated by preeclampsia and 0.56 per 1000 births were complicated by eclampsia. The rate of mild or unspecified preeclampsia remained constant over the study period. In contrast, the rate of severe preeclampsia increased sharply and the rate of eclampsia declined by 36%. Maternal age less than 20 years old was the strongest risk factor for both preeclampsia and eclampsia. These data indicate a need for improved prenatal care among teenagers.\r"

The intrauterine background noise was measured with a miniaturized hydrophone placed transcervically at the level of the fetal neck under ultrasonographic guidance. In eight women no cardiovascular noise was audible and the intrauterine noise consisted predominantly of low-frequency noise (less than 100 Hz) from 60 to 85 dB. Above 100 Hz, the sound pressure level was less than 60 dB, decreasing to 40 dB above 500 Hz. In only two women maternal cardiovascular sounds were audible during uterine relaxation and disappeared during uterine contraction. Maternal bowel sounds and maternal vocalization were well above the intrauterine background noise. Because of this relative quietness, we hypothesized that the fetal acoustic environment could be altered significantly during antenatal vibratory acoustic stimulation.\r"

However, with improved maternal and fetal surveillance the impact of preeclampsia in diabetic pregnancies is declining. This prospective controlled study compared the incidence of preeclampsia and maternal-fetal outcome in 334 diabetic pregnancies and 16,534 nondiabetic pregnancies. The incidence of preeclampsia was 9.9% (33/334) in diabetic pregnancies compared with 4.3% (716/16,534) in nondiabetic controls. The incidence of preeclampsia rose with increasing severity of diabetes by White classification, but was still 8.9% after exclusion of diabetic patients with nephropathy or chronic hypertension. The perinatal mortality rate per 1000 births was 60 for preeclamptic diabetic patients compared with 3.3 for normotensive diabetic patients. Parity, maternal age, and blood glucose control were similar in preeclamptic diabetic patients compared with normotensive diabetic patients. We conclude that preeclampsia is twice as common in diabetic pregnancies compared with normal controls.\r"

Discarded urine samples of 1206 parturient women were saved and given code numbers that were also assigned to data sheets containing nonidentifying information, including prenatal care status and syphilis serologic results. In the latter part of the study blood remaining after syphilis serologic tests were performed (n = 480) were tested for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. Overall 12.9% of urine samples had cocaine derivatives, 1.4% opiates, 1.5% marijuana, 0.0% benzodiazepine, and 0.3% methadone. The prevalence of positive rapid plasma reagin tests was 18.7% among patients with positive urine toxicologic tests for cocaine and 2.41% for patients with negative urine tests (odds ratio = 9.3, 95% confidence interval 5.2 to 16.5, p less than 0.001). Fluorescent treponemal antibodies were also significantly more frequent among patients with positive urine samples. Four of 53 (7.6%) patients with positive urine toxicologic screens were human immunodeficiency virus antibody positive compared with six of 427 (1.4%) women with negative screens (odds ratio = 5.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.4 to 21.5, p = 0.019). Cocaine patients with positive cocaine screens and with syphilis or human immunodeficiency virus had prenatal care in 6 of 21 (28.6%) and 0 of 4 (0%) cases, respectively, while patients with negative cocaine screens and syphilis or human immunodeficiency virus had prenatal care in 13 of 18 (72.2%) and 5 of 6 (83.3%) cases, respectively (p = 0.010 and p = 0.048). Cocaine use appears to be associated with both the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis and the failure of infected individuals to utilize prenatal services.\r"

National data held at the Medical Birth Registry was used for identification of cases. The original medical records were retrieved for 862 such twins born between 1973 and 1983. Twins with cerebral palsy and/or mental retardation born between 1973 and 1980 were identified by questionnaires to all rehabilitation centers for disabled children, offices for the Provision of Care for the Mentally Retarded, and to all local Boards of Education throughout Sweden. The analyses, including calculation of relative risk and 95% confidence interval, were performed after stratification for birth weight (250 gm classes) and period of delivery (1973 to 1976, 1977 to 1980, 1981 to 1983). The cesarean section rate increased from 7.7% (1973 to 1976), and 40.5% (1977 to 1980) to 68.9% (1981 to 1983). Concomitantly, intrapartum and neonatal mortality decreased markedly (51.7% to 29.1%) particularly for twin II but to a much lesser extent for twin I. The relative risk for intrapartum and neonatal mortality (vaginal/abdominal birth) did not increase significantly for twin I in vertex presentation (relative risk 2.0, 95% confidence limits 0.9 to 4.3), for twin I in breech presentation (relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence limits 0.7 to 4.3), for twin II in vertex presentation (relative risk 0.6, 95% confidence limits 0.2 to 1.6), or for twin II in breech presentation (relative risk 1.5, 95% confidence limits 0.7 to 3.0). The rate of cerebral palsy and/or mental retardation was 8.8% during 1973 to 1976 and 8.0 during 1977 to 1980 (chi 2 = 0.1, p greater than 0.05). For twins born in breech presentation the handicap rate in the first period (cesarean section rate 6.0%) was the same as in the second period (cesarean section rate 59.6%). The analysis failed to reveal any significant impact of abdominal birth on the fetal outcome for low-birth-weight twins, even when fetal presentation was taken into consideration.\r"

Adenomyosis was the single indication for which an increase in hysterectomy rate was observed. This increase, however, was completely reversed during the last 2 years of the study. This quality assurance process also resulted in a significant increase in the histologic verification rate (i.e., 82% vs 93%, p less than 0.001). These observations suggest that using such a criteria-based process can reduce the number of hysterectomies performed and improve the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis.\r"

The imager, operating at a proton resonance frequency of 22 MHz, produces transaxial views in 64 or 128 milliseconds. These images comprise either 64 x 128 or 128 x 128 pixels with an in-plane resolution of 3 x 3 mm2. The slice thickness is 10 mm. Fetal scans of up to 32 contiguous slices are produced in a few minutes. These have been used to study the internal structure of the uterus and the fetus in a range of cases with gestations ranging from 26 weeks to term. Echo-planar imaging seems particularly suitable as an imaging modality since its high speed obviates image blurring arising from fetal motion.\r"

There are many factors operative in the preparation of irradiated packed red blood cells that may predispose to high potassium levels: the age of the red blood cells, the number of procedures used to concentrate the blood, the duration of time elapsed from concentration, the duration of time elapsed from irradiation, and the hematocrit. Use of fresh blood, avoidance of multiple packing procedures, limiting the hematocrit in the donor unit to less than or equal to 80%, and minimizing the time between concentration, irradiation and transfusion may minimize the potassium levels, and therefore making an additional washing procedure unnecessary.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of estrogen replacement therapy on bone loss of surgically postmenopausal cynomolgus macaques was evaluated histomorphometrically using the first (L-1) lumbar vertebra and ex vivo dual photon absorptiometry of the third (L-3) lumbar vertebra. The animals were a subgroup of a larger study on the effects of estrogen replacement therapy on diet-induced coronary artery atherosclerosis. The three experimental conditions were as follows: untreated females with oophorectomy, females with oophorectomy treated with continuous estrogen replacement therapy plus cyclic progesterone, and females with oophorectomy treated with estrogen replacement therapy. Bone mineral density (grams per square centimeter) of L-3, when covaried for body mass index (body mass index, body weight/(trunk length/100)2), was significantly lower for the oophorectomy group compared with the group treated by estrogen replacement therapy plus progesterone and estrogen replacement therapy groups (p = 0.018). When covaried for body mass index, trabecular bone volume percentage of a midsagittal section of L-1 was not significantly different between groups, but the adjusted mean was greatest in the estrogen replacement therapy plus progesterone group, followed closely by the estrogen replacement therapy group, and was least in the oophorectomy group. When covaried for body mass index, trabecular plate number was significantly lower (p = 0.022) and mean trabecular plate separation was significantly higher (p = 0.033) in the oophorectomy group. Thus both estrogen replacement therapy and estrogen replacement therapy plus progesterone provided overall protection against surgical menopause--associated bone mass loss. Cynomolgus macaques are an extremely useful animal model for estrogen replacement therapy use in prevention of postmenopausal bone loss.\r"

Day 8 (gastrulating) mouse embryos were placed in hypoglycemic medium (60, 80, 100, or 110 mg/dl glucose) for 4 hours in which normoglycemia (120 to 150 mg/dl glucose) was restored for the remaining 44 hours of culture. Day 9 (neurulating) mouse embryos were exposed to hypoglycemia (20, 40, 60, or 80 mg/dl glucose) for 2, 4, 6, or 24 hours followed by normoglycemia for the remainder of 24 hours. At the end of culture embryos were evaluated for growth and malformations and compared with controls grown in normoglycemic medium. The results show that a 50% reduction in glucose for as little as 2 hours causes dysmorphogenesis in neurulating mouse embryos, whereas longer exposure times, more severe levels of hypoglycemia, or both are required to affect growth. Furthermore, gastrulating embryos are more sensitive to short periods of hypoglycemia than those undergoing neurulation.\r"

Granulosa cell tumors developed in predictable stages, starting as preneoplastic lesions appearing as hyperemic follicles on the ovarian surface. These follicles were characterized by hypertrophied theca, degenerating oocytes, and large fluid- or erythrocyte-filled antra lined by irregular masses of granulosa cells. Rapidly proliferating granulosa cells filled the antra and the theca/interstitial cells became more dysplastic as granulosa cell tumors developed. Thus the morphology of the preneoplastic lesion suggests that disturbed mechanisms for normal follicular development underlie granulosa cell tumor initiation. Estradiol treatment before but not after preneoplastic lesions appeared inhibited granulosa cell tumor formation. By 6 to 9 months 42% of these mice show metastases in major abdominal and thoracic organs. Thus this model can be experimentally analyzed both for mechanisms of granulosa cell tumor initiation and subsequent malignant progression.\r"

This method with a deoxyribonucleic acid minisatellite probe requires only a small amount of tissue sample and peripheral blood, and presents individual specific restriction fragment length polymorphisms (deoxyribonucleic acid \"fingerprints\") by simultaneous detection of many hypervariable regions (minisatellite regions) widely dispersed in the human genome. Southern blot hybridization showed that in cases of complete mole, all polymorphic fragments were exclusively inherited from the father. Some of the polymorphic bands of paternal deoxyribonucleic acid were not observed in molar deoxyribonucleic acid. However, in the hydropic abortus, the polymorphic fragments could be traced back to its parent. These results indicate that deoxyribonucleic acid fingerprints could distinguish the abnormal fertilization of complete mole (androgenesis) from the normal fertilization of hydropic abortus by identifying the difference in genetic variations between complete mole and hydropic abortus at the deoxyribonucleic acid level.\r"

Absolute tension development per unit of cross-sectional area induced by high potassium and oxytocin concentrations in the intact condition, or by Ca2+ in the skinned condition, markedly increased in human myometrium at term compared with the nonpregnant state. The maximum tension in skinned strips was 8.3 mN/mm2 in nonpregnant strips and 47.5 mN/mm2 at term (both obtained at 10 mumol/L Ca2+). The Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile proteins in skinned strips also increased at term compared with the nonpregnant state; the half-maximal response of Ca2+ sensitivity was 0.7 mumol/L in the nonpregnant state and 0.3 mumol/L at term. These results suggest that in human myometrium both the amount of contractile proteins and their sensitivity to Ca2+ may increase at term compared with the nonpregnant state.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the effect of a 6-hour phase shift in the light-dark cycle on the 24-hour rhythm of myometrial activity with 15 chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus monkeys during the last third of gestation. Monkeys were housed indoors in constant temperature on a 14-hour-light/10-hour-dark photoperiod in two groups based on the time the lights were turned on (group A lights on at 6 AM and group B lights on at midnight). The power spectra were calculated for periods of 512 readings (1.138 hours) starting at the time the lights were turned on for continuous periods of 25.03 hours of data showing well-developed contraction-type activity at any time during that period. The power spectra data for contractures and contractions were analyzed separately from myometrial electromyographic data. During the 14 hours of light, myometrial activity was primarily composed of contractures. In all experimental animals the switch from contractures to contractions occurred around the time the lights were turned off. The proportion of contraction-type activity in each 1.138-hour analysis interval expressed as a percentage of the total contraction power for the whole 25.03-hour analysis period for all monkeys increased around the time the lights were turned off in both groups. The increase in contractions was observed 12 to 15 hours after the lights were turned on. No systematic change in the proportion of contracture activity was observed. Peak contraction activity was 22.6 +/- 0.60 hours (16.6 hours after lights on), and was at 18.3 +/- 1.4 hours (18.31 hours after lights on) in groups A and B, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (22.6 +/- 0.6 vs 18.3 +/- 1.4 hours, p less than 0.05). Seven of eight monkeys in group A and six of seven in group B had switched from contractures to contractions before lights were turned off. We have confirmed a 24-hour rhythm in myometrial activity in the pregnant rhesus monkey and provided new evidence to support the endogenous nature of this rhythm and its direct relationship to the light-dark cycle.\r"

This study examines the effects of clonidine on breathing and sleep-state cycling in fetal lambs. Clonidine was infused into a fetal lateral ventricle for up to 24 hours at 128 to 135 days' gestation. Control infusions of artificial cerebrospinal fluid had no effect. Clonidine infusion significantly reduced the incidence and episode duration of fetal breathing for the duration of the infusion period. Cycling of electrocortical activity became irregular and rapid, and the incidence of high-voltage electrocortical activity (equivalent to quiet sleep) was reduced. Fetal heart rate decreased but arterial pressure was unaffected. After infusion the breathing incidence and episode duration both increased significantly compared with control, with continuous high-amplitude breathing for several hours, whereas the incidence of high-voltage electrocortical activity remained low. Because lung development is promoted by fetal breathing, long-term use of clonidine during pregnancy could slow lung development by reducing fetal breathing activity.\r"

PCR-SB results were correlated with histologic, immunohistochemical, and serologic findings. All cases with an established HBV etiology were positive by PCR-SB, as were three cases with negative immunohistochemistry and serology. Often there was selective amplification with one primer set and, in two cases, smaller than expected HBV amplification products suggesting internal deletions. The presence of a potent PCR inhibitor in nucleic acid preparations from tissue blocks that can be removed by Sephadex G-50 chromatography was confirmed. PCR-SB will be a powerful method for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with HBV infection and may provide new insights into viral hepatocarcinogenesis.\r"

RNA content was divided into low and high groups, based on the average RNA content in normal kidney controls. High RNA content was significantly correlated with aneuploidy, high proliferative index, high nuclear grade, cytoplasmic granularity, and large tumor size. No correlation was found between RNA content and patients' sex, race, and clinical stage of the carcinomas. When diploid RCCs were separately analyzed, high RNA content was correlated with high nuclear grade, large tumor size, high clinical stage, and cytoplasmic granularity. There was no correlation between RNA content and the patient's sex or race or the neoplasm's proliferative index. Of the 16 patients that relapsed (5 diploid and 11 aneuploid), four of the diploid and all 11 aneuploid neoplasms displayed high RNA content. The authors' data show that RNA may be a valuable objective and quantitative parameter in the clinicopathologic assessment of RCC.\r"

  ".W": "The focus of research on the neurofibrillary pathology (NFP) of Alzheimer disease has been not only to determine the component forming the paired helical filaments but also to determine whether they result from abnormal processes affecting a single protein. Therefore, although these studies have lead to controversy concerning the respective contribution of components of microtubules and neurofilaments, there has been essentially no consideration of whether other cytoskeletal systems might also be involved and of what are the common features for the incorporated components. Particularly relevant to this issue is our finding that several antisera raised to either skeletal or smooth muscle tropomyosin, a microfilament component, intensely recognize NFP. These antibodies continue to recognize NFP after affinity purification to tropomyosin or paired helical filament fractions. We show that the antibodies do not recognize NFP due to cross-reactivity with the previously identified NFP components related to neurofilaments and microtubules, tau, and MAP2, or neurofilament proteins because the antisera did not recognize these proteins on immunoblots or were not adsorbable by the proteins. Ultrastructural analysis of the immunoreaction showed that tropomyosin-related epitopes were clustered rather than uniformly distributed along paired helical and straight filaments. Although the distribution suggests that tropomyosin is an NFP-associated protein, its retention by paired helical and straight filaments after detergent extraction indicates that it is an integral component strongly and specifically associated with the filaments characteristic of NFP. These findings indicate that NFP involves the three primary neuronal cytoskeletal filament systems, microtubules, neurofilaments, as well as microfilaments, and therefore that NFP probably results from the reorganization of these normal filaments that interact to comprise the cytomatrix and may continue this interaction under the pathologic condition of Alzheimer's disease to generate novel, abnormal polymers.\r"

The study groups include 1) permanent occlusion; 2) reperfusion after periods of coronary occlusion of 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes; 3) reperfusion with diltiazem and with 4) methoxamine after a 60-minute occlusion period; and 5) permanent reocclusion after a 30-minute period of reperfusion. Red blood cell counts were directly assessed by visual examination of histologic slices of myocardium and in a subgroup of animals by counts of red blood cells labeled with 99m-technetium pertechnetate. Hemorrhage occurs in infarcts reperfused after a duration of 45 minutes or more of coronary occlusion and after a period of reperfusion maintained for at least 30 minutes. Red blood cell counts were maximal in the mid portions of transmural sections of the infarcts, with decreasing values toward epicardium and endocardium. Diltiazem decreased total red blood cell counts, whereas methoxamine increased it and also caused subendocardial hemorrhage. The most powerful predictors of the severity of hemorrhage after sustained reperfusion were infarct size and higher blood pressure.\r"

However, little is known as to whether heparin has an effect on the extracellular matrix. In the present study, the effect of heparin on the content and regional distribution of elastin, collagen, and proteoglycans (PGs) in blood vessels following experimental injury was determined. Two groups of rats were subjected to left common carotid balloon injury and were infused with either 0.9% saline or heparin in a saline solution, for 2 weeks. Using a new morphometric method of analysis, the authors determined changes in volumes of elastin, collagen, and PGs contained within an 'extracellular matrix domain (ECM domain),' the average envelope of connective tissue surrounding each smc. Heparin treatment inhibited intimal thickening and decreased the elastin content in the ECM domain in the upper and lower arterial intima. Collagen also was found to be significantly decreased 5.0-fold and 7.6-fold in the ECM domains of upper and lower intima, respectively, of heparin-treated animals. The decrease in both elastin and collagen was balanced by a significant increase in amorphous and filamentous electron-dense material. Heparin also caused a significant 1.8-fold and 1.9-fold increase in the PG content in the ECM domain in the upper and lower intima, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis, using antibodies to elastin and PG subclasses, supported the morphometric observations. This study has shown that heparin administered in vivo can alter the accumulation and distribution of each of the major vascular ECM components in a specific and differential manner.\r"

  ".W": "It is likely that the characteristic histologic features of Hodgkin's disease reflect cytokine production by the tumor cell population. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and lymphotoxin (tumor necrosis factor beta [TNF-beta]) are important inflammatory mediators with wide-ranging effects within the lymphoreticular system. The aim of the present study was to investigate TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin production in the Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines L428 and L540. At the product level, both cytokines could be demonstrated by immunostaining with specific monoclonal antibodies. TNF-alpha could be demonstrated by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in culture supernatants from both cell lines as well as in cell lysates of L428 and L540 cells. Cytotoxic activity could be achieved only in L428 supernatants. This cytotoxic activity could not be blocked by the addition of a polyclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, but was partially inhibited with the monoclonal antibody against lymphotoxin. Synthesis of TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin in both L428 and L540 was confirmed by demonstrating the intracellular-specific messenger RNA (mRNA) using specific cDNA clones in Northern blot analysis. In situ hybridization studies with the TNF-alpha cDNA probe gave positive hybridization signals in L428 and in L540. These results demonstrate the transcription, translation, and export of TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin in cultured Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines. In addition, results of preliminary experiments are presented in which we demonstrate Reed-Sternberg cells positive for TNF-alpha protein and mRNA in different Hodgkin's disease tissue biopsies, indicating that, at least for TNF-alpha, our cell line data are relevant to the neoplastic population present in Hodgkin's disease tissue.\r"

Protein AA subspecies varying between 45 and 94 amino acids in length have been described. In this study it is shown that the different protein AA subspecies are not evenly distributed in amyloid deposits and that in single patients, certain subspecies of protein AA are deposited in specific tissue component sites. Thus larger protein AA subspecies occur in lower concentration in amyloid in the glomeruli compared to other sites and are especially found in amyloid in vessel walls. Three different SAA forms have been predicted from genomic and complementary DNA studies. The existence of a fourth type has been suspected from amino acid sequence studies of purified SAA. Protein AA derived from this fourth type of SAA is now shown to be present in amyloid fibrils in one of the patients studied in this paper.\r"

  ".W": "Although direct intercellular contacts between alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts have been described in developing and adult lung, the frequency of such contacts and their relationship to type 2 cell division and differentiation in normal and abnormal repair is not known. The authors now correlate measurements of type 2 cell basal surface, basement membrane continuity, and the incidence of epithelial-interstitial cell contacts with the proliferative index of type 2 cells and fibroblasts in normal repair (after hyperoxia) and in abnormal repair with fibrosis (after bleomycin or butylated hydroxytoluene). In each case, type 1 cell necrosis was followed by an increase in type 2 cell basal surface as the cells spread over the denuded capillary wall before dividing. After hyperoxia, a high but short-lived peak in type 2 cell division was not accompanied by fibrosis. After more severe drug-induced injury, the type 2 proliferative phase was extended and was accompanied by prolonged fibroblast growth. Type 2 cells persisted where they covered a thick interstitium of fibroblasts and fibrillar collagen. The incidence of epithelial-interstitial cell contacts decreased at the time of maximal type 2 cell division, then increased immediately after the peak. The results suggest a reciprocal epithelial-fibroblast control system whereby 1) epithelial necrosis and delayed repair promotes fibroblast growth, and 2) direct contact of epithelial cells with fibroblasts or fibrillar collagen may provide a factor important for the regulation of type 2 cell growth and differentiation.\r"

The authors have studied cell surface components of human esophageal carcinoma cells recognized by macrophages. Superoxide release from THP-1 cells, a human macrophage cell line, was analyzed in their interaction with a battery of human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (TE) originated from esophageal cancer patients. The macrophage-triggering ability of TE 1 cell line, a high stimulant, was reduced after treatment with trypsin or tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosidic glycosylation. Addition of monosaccharides was efficient in competitive inhibition of these cellular interaction. Moreover, con-A-resistant mutation of TE 1 cells was found to reduce their macrophage-triggering ability, associated with increase of L-PHA-binding capacity, suggesting substitution to the GlcNAc beta(1----6)-linked lactosamine antenna in N-glycosidic carbohydrates. These findings suggest that terminal residues of N-glycosidic carbohydrates on some esophageal carcinoma cells may contribute to the recognition sites of macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have evaluated the in vivo effects of cyclosporine A on the de-endothelialized rabbit carotid artery. Vascular endothelium was gently removed from the common carotid artery of 10 New Zealand White rabbits that then were treated with therapeutic doses of cyclosporine A (15 mg/kg/day), or its vehicle (Cremophor-EL). Significant intimal proliferation was observed in all cases 2 weeks after de-endothelialization. Concomitant cyclosporine A therapy had no significant effect on intimal smooth muscle proliferation, but was associated with 1) intimal smooth muscle vacuolation, 2) an increase in total intimal thickening, because of the presence of numerous macrophage-derived foam cells, and 3) incorporation of 3H-thymidine by neo-intimal monocyte/macrophages. Mean plasma cholesterol levels were moderately increased in both groups. Although this may have contributed to foam cell formation in the cyclosporine-A-treated animals, it was not the sole determinant, as foam-cell-rich lesions were not observed in control animals. In vitro, cyclosporine A reduced the rate of proliferation of rabbit aortic smooth muscle and endothelial cells in a dose-dependent fashion, and induced smooth muscle cell vacuolation. These data suggest that cyclosporine A may contribute to the formation of graft-related atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the morphogenesis of lung remodeling in pulmonary Langerhans cell granulomatosis (LCG; previously called histiocytosis X or eosinophilic granuloma), lung tissues obtained by open biopsy from 62 patients with pulmonary LCG were studied by light and electron microscopy. Tissues from 20 patients were also studied by immunohistochemical methods for the detection of fibronectin, elastin, and S-100 protein, and samples from six patients were studied using OKT6 monoclonal antibody. In early stages of pulmonary LCG, the epithelial lining cells were detached and Langerhans cells, inflammatory cells, and myofibroblasts migrated into intraluminal spaces through gaps in the epithelial basement membranes in and around the granulomatous lesions. In late stages, intraluminal fibrosis led to obstruction of alveolar spaces and airways and to coalescence of alveolar walls in and around the granulomatous lesions. Adjacent to these lesions, irregularly dilated alveoli were found with degraded and disrupted elastic fibers. Together, these observations suggest that intraluminal fibrosis and elastic fiber degradation are important processes of lung remodeling in pulmonary LCG.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied four chordomas with malignant spindle cell components (SCs) and 12 conventional chordomas (CCs) by DNA flow cytometry using paraffin-embedded tissue. In addition, immunohistochemical stains for a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal markers were performed. The four SCs contained areas histologically identical to conventional chordomas, as well as a high-grade malignant spindle cell component. All four (100%) SCs had an aneuploid-multiploid DNA content. Of interest, the conventional chordoma areas in these tumors had DNA contents different from those containing the high-grade malignant spindle cells. In contrast, only three (27%) of the 11 conventional chordomas with analyzable histograms had an aneuploid-multiploid DNA content. Immunohistochemical studies performed on the four SCs showed the high-grade malignant spindle cells to stain strongly for vimentin and weakly for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), whereas the areas of conventional chordoma in these same neoplasms stained moderately for vimentin and S-100 protein, and strongly for cytokeratin and EMA. In two cases, the staining for EMA and cytokeratin highlighted a gradual transition between the areas of conventional chordoma and the spindle cell areas. The immunohistochemical staining pattern of the 12 conventional chordomas was similar to that seen in the conventional chordoma components of the four chordomas with malignant spindle cell components. These results suggest that: 1) aneuploidy is more common in SCs than in CCs, and 2) some SCs are multipotential neoplasms in which the neoplastic cells are capable of differentiation along both epithelial and mesenchymal pathways.\r"

Lymphocytes from normal BALB/cBy female mice were cultured for times varying from 2 to 10 days on syngeneic neonatal myocytes treated with doxorubicin, and surviving lymphocytes was assayed for cytotoxicity to drug-treated and untreated myocyte targets. Maximal cytolytic responses occurred on day 8. Activity to treated targets was twice that observed with untreated myocytes. Concentrations of the drug as low as 10(-8) mol/l (molar) for as little as 30 minutes initiated the necessary antigenic changes, although treatment with 10(2)-fold higher concentration for 4 to 6 hours appeared optimal. Cytotoxicity of the lymphocyte population could be eliminated by pretreatment of the sensitized effector cells with either anti-Thy 1.2 or anti-Lyt 2 monoclonal antibody and complement, while treatment with complement alone or anti-L3T4 monoclonal antibody and complement were ineffective. Myocardial cells were not the only tissue-derived targets susceptible to lysis by the drug-induced CTL. Lymphocytes stimulated on doxorubicin-treated myocytes demonstrated even better cytotoxicity to drug-treated neonatal kidney cells, but showed only minimal activity to neonatal liver or skin fibroblasts. Concentrations of doxorubicin per 10(6) cells was greatest for kidney cells followed by heart and liver cells. Skin fibroblasts incorporated the least amount of the drug. Therefore, there was a partial correlation between sensitivity of drug-treated targets to immune cytolysis and drug uptake.\r"

  ".U": "90350814\r", 
  ".W": "The leukocytosis activity of C5a was studied in a rabbit model. Blood samples were drawn for cell counts through a catheter placed in an artery of one rabbit ear after injection of either porcine or human C5a into a vein in the opposite ear. These studies indicate the potential of C5a to mobilize bone marrow neutrophils following transient C5a-induced neutropenia, based on counts of nonsegmented neutrophils. The numbers of circulating neutrophils can be selectively elevated by 300% to 400%, within 1 to 2 hours, in rabbits given only microgram quantities (1 to 5 x 10(-9) mol/l) of C5a or C5adesArg. These quantities of C5a are equivalent to 1% to 2% of complement C5 activation. The time-course of the induced neutrophilia is characteristic of C5a, increasing rapidly in the first 10 to 20 minutes after injection and attaining a maximum level at 2 to 5 hours, then decreasing slowly to normal levels over the next 4 to 6 hours. After boiling at 100 degrees C for 10 minutes, C5a (C5ades Arg) lost its leukocytosis activity, indicating that the cellular effect was not caused by endotoxin. Other known leukocytosis factors, such as epinephrine, dexamethasone, lipopolysaccharide, and the prostanoid 15(S)-15-methyl PGF2 alpha, produced a distinctly different profile of leukocyte mobilization than that of C5a. The C5a-induced neutrophilia was not inhibited by pretreating these animals with indomethacin, suggesting that it is not a prostanoid-induced effect. One hypothesis is that no secondary cellular mediator system is involved in C5a-mediated leukocytosis, but rather than C5a alone is responsible for a rapid mobilization of neutrophils from bone marrow pools, and perhaps marginated pools, following neutropenia. Circulating neutrophils are activated by C5a and thereby become deformed and adherent, leading to a neutropenia, sequestration, and depletion of cells. After the neutropenic event an immediate neutrophilic response is required for replacement of this particular cell population and to re-establish homeostasis. Therefore the role of C5a may be just as important as other known leukocytosis factors (fragments from C3, for example) in promoting complement-dependent neutrophil mobilization in response to tissue injury, infections, or extracorporeal blood treatments.\r"

All 7 functional adenomas and 4 subtype 1 tumors had detectable POMC mRNA, while 3 of 6 subtype 2 and 1 of 7 subtype 3 silent adenomas contained detectable POMC mRNA. In situ hybridization analysis with an 35S-labeled beta-actin probe showed a positive hybridization signal in 22 of 22 cases, indicating that the absence of detectable POMC mRNA in some adenomas was not due to loss of the mRNAs during processing of the tissues or because of the age of the embedded tissue blocks. Northern hybridization analysis with the oligonucleotide probes in 2 normal pituitaries and an adenoma causing Cushing's disease detected a 1.2-Kb mRNA in all three tissues, indicating that the oligonucleotide probes were very specific. These results indicate that subtype 1 silent adenomas and clinically active adenomas associated with Cushing's disease contain POMC mRNA that is readily detectable by ISH in routinely processed tissue specimens, while only a few of the subtypes 2 and 3 adenomas have POMC mRNA that can be detected in paraffin blocks with the oligonucleotide probes used in this study.\r"

Intragastric pH and volume were measured immediately after induction of anaesthesia and on completion of surgery. All patients had gastric aspirates less than 25 ml. None of the omeprazole group had an aspirate of pH less than 3.5. Six patients (19%) in the ranitidine group had aspirates of pH less than 3.5, a significant difference from the omeprazole group (p less than 0.05). Of these six, two (6%) had aspirates of pH less than 2.5. Hence this study showed that omeprazole was more effective and consistent than ranitidine at maintaining gastric pH greater than 3.5.\r"

The relationship between double-burst stimulation ratio and train-of-four ratio was indistinguishable from the line of identity. The train-of-four response, if repeated more than 12 seconds after double-burst stimulation, was not depressed compared with pre double-burst stimulation values. Fifteen anaesthetists were asked to detect fade manually in the second part of the study, while train-of-four was recorded on the opposite arm. One hundred and fourteen determinations were made in 12 patients. Fade was detected manually more often with double-burst stimulation than with TOF.\r"

Early diastolic filling of the left ventricle decreased from 55% to 35% during surgery. The contribution of atrial contraction to left ventricular filling increased from 41% to 62% (p less than 0.001). We conclude that coronary artery bypass grafting results in impairment of diastolic function during the operation.\r"

Time of surgery, intravenous fluid administration and operating theatre temperature were standardised. Mean (SD) aural canal (core) temperature decreased significantly in groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.001), while there was a fall of 0.3 degrees C (0.6) in group 3, which was not significant. Mean skin temperature decreased during anaesthesia and surgery in both groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.05), while it increased in group 3. There was a significantly greater loss of body heat in groups 1 and 2 compared with group 3 intra-operatively (p less than 0.001).

An ethanol-containing irrigating fluid was used in this study of 100 transurethral resections so that the irrigant absorption could be monitored by measuring ethanol in expired air. Fluid absorption was found in 41 patients, and in nine of them the volume of irrigant absorbed exceeded 1000 ml. Four of these operations were terminated promptly when the ethanol monitoring indicated rapid massive absorption that threatened to exceed 2000 ml. There were few and only mild adverse effects of the irrigant by following this regimen. It is concluded that ethanol monitoring makes it possible to prevent the TUR syndrome by selective termination of those operations in which large amounts of irrigant is absorbed.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and short- and long-term outcomes of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in octogenarians. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of clinical series. SETTING: Referral-based university medical center. PATIENTS: Consecutive series of 54 octogenarian patients (mean age, 82.4 years) who had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty between March 1980 and December 1988. Of these patients, 91% presented with severe angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class III or IV); 59% had unstable angina. Twenty-six patients (48%) had had a previous myocardial infarction and 15 (28%) had had previous coronary artery bypass surgery. Multivessel disease was present in 44 patients (81%). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 50 months (mean, 19 months). INTERVENTION: Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: The angiographic success rate was 50 of 54 (93%; 95% CI, 81% to 98%) and the clinical success rate was 49 of 54 (91%; CI, 79% to 97%). Two patients had procedure-related myocardial infarction. Two patients died in the hospital, 1 from cardiac tamponade because of pacemaker perforation and 1 from cardiogenic shock after a myocardial infarction despite successful angioplasty. During the follow-up period 4 patients required bypass surgery, 2 had myocardial infarction, and 7 died (4 deaths were cardiac). Eleven patients (20%) had re-stenosis, 7 of whom were managed with repeat angioplasty, including 1 patient who had four procedures. At follow-up, 42 of 45 survivors (93%) were asymptomatic or had class II angina. The Kaplan-Meier survival for all patients, including those who died in the hospital, was 87% at 1 year and 80% at 3 years. Cumulative freedom from major cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, or coronary bypass surgery) was 81% at 1 year and 78% at 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can be done in octogenarians with a high rate of angiographic and clinical success, low complication rate, and a favorable long-term (3-year) outcome. As such, it is a treatment option in managing advanced coronary artery disease in this fragile group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical course of Alzheimer-type dementia and those factors that might predict or influence the length of survival. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and twenty-six patients diagnosed with Alzheimer-type dementia were selected from among 200 consecutive outpatients evaluated for suspected dementia from 1980 to 1982. All 126 patients had at least 6 years of follow-up. SETTING: All patients were initially seen as outpatients at a university hospital. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Survival analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the Cox proportional hazards model. The mean age at symptom onset was 73.9 years and at enrollment in the study, 77.6 years. The median survival from time of enrollment in the study was 5.3 years (range, 0.2 to 7.2+ years) and from symptom onset, 9.3 years (range, 1.8 to 16+ years). Dementia severity, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), was strongly associated with survival (P less than 0.001); the median survival of patients with scores of 18 or below was 3 years less than that of patients with scores above 18 (relative risk, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.4). Comorbid conditions and symptom duration were not related to survival. A multivariate analysis of age at symptom onset and of historical features showed that the combination of wandering and falling (relative risk, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 5.2) and the presence of behavioral problems (relative risk, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.7 to 2.9) at the time of evaluation appeared to adversely affect survival. CONCLUSIONS: Length of survival in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia is highly variable; severity of disease (not duration), the combination of wandering and falling, and behavioral problems are associated with shorter survival. Our findings, if confirmed, may provide prognostic information for families and professionals and suggest areas in which interventions to improve survival might be focused.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective analysis of jejunal biopsies from 43 patients with AIDS, 10 patients with AIDS-related complex, and 6 heterosexual control volunteers. The biopsies were examined for pathogens; electron microscopy was used in 22 patients. The results of quantitative histologic measurements were correlated with histopathologic features and D-xylose absorption. SETTING: A university-affiliated teaching hospital with many AIDS patients of varying demographic characteristics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Jejunal biopsies in 62% of the patients with AIDS had partial villus atrophy with or without crypt hyperplasia unlike those of controls, a result implying small intestinal injury. Small intestinal injury was associated with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and cytopathic change of the villus epithelium. Light and electron microscopic examination detected cryptosporidia or microsporidia in 19 of 27 patients with small intestinal injury. The presence of these parasites was associated with significantly diminished D-xylose absorption when compared with absorption in controls or in patients with AIDS, diarrhea, weight loss, and no parasites. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients with AIDS with severe small intestinal injury have enterocyte infections. Like cryptosporidiosis, intestinal microsporidiosis may be an important cause of enteropathy in patients with AIDS.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published between 1966 and January 1990 were identified through computer searches and references of identified studies. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that included a careful description of the patients under study, well-defined interventions, and a meaningful criterion standard were emphasized. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from different studies were combined to estimate the probability of positive and negative test results in well-defined clinical situations. Informal methods of synthesizing evidence were used when combining data from different studies was not justified. RESULTS: The sensitive thyrotropin (TSH) test is the preferred method to monitor therapy because it agrees with physiologic measures of thyroid hormone effect. Among clinically euthyroid patients who take 100 to 150 micrograms/d of levothyroxine, the probability that the sensitive thyrotropin will be undetectable is close to 50%. These patients are most likely to benefit from testing. Patients who take over 250 micrograms/d are almost certain to have undetectable sensitive thyrotropin levels; in these patients, the dose may be lowered without testing. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate long-term studies are needed to determine the role of biochemical testing in monitoring therapy. Current evidence suggests that the sensitive thyrotropin test should be used to monitor therapy. Clinically euthyroid patients taking lower dosages of levothyroxine are most likely to benefit from testing.\r"

Cirrhosis had no detectable effect on the pharmacokinetics of cefetamet and on the bioavailability of cefetamet pivoxil. After intravenous cefetamet in control versus cirrhotic subjects, respectively, the following mean +/- standard deviation values were observed: total body clearance, 128 +/- 10.2 versus 123 +/- 28.8 ml/min; steady-state volume of distribution, 23.2 +/- 2.2 versus 22.7 +/- 4.6 liters; half-life, 2.42 +/- 0.21 versus 2.35 +/- 0.41 h. Renal and nonrenal clearances of cefetamet were similar in both groups, as were the mean residence times and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve. For oral cefetamet pivoxil, no differences were detected in the mean values of the percentage of dose absorbed: 44.6 +/- 9.1 versus 50.1 +/- 12.9. The rate of appearance of cefetamet in the plasma also was not affected by cirrhosis: similar mean values were found for the mean residence time and the maximum concentration in plasma and its time of occurrence.\r"

In each of the two pairings (vancomycin with peptide and DD-peptidase with peptide), polypeptide backbones were antiparallel, and the antibiotic or enzyme enveloped the peptide substrate from opposite sides. Hydrogen-bonding groups on the substrate which are involved with the DD-peptidase were shown to be different from the ones reported from nuclear magnetic resonance studies to be involved with vancomycin. Because of steric hindrance, the binding of either molecule to the substrate prevents the binding of the other molecule. Binding to the substrate by a D-alanyl-D-alanine-recognizing protein in a manner similar to that used by the DD-peptidase could explain recent observations of vancomycin resistance, in which a new membrane-associated protein has been detected.\r"

  ".W": "Commonly used antibiotics were compared for their ability to induce Clostridium difficile enterocecitis and death in hamsters. Susceptibility to infection with C. difficile was measured by calculating 50% lethal doses (in CFU) for hamsters for various intervals after antibiotic treatment. Infection occurred after very small doses of C. difficile were given to hamsters treated with clindamycin, ampicillin, flucloxacillin, and cefuroxime; there was little difference between the antibiotics in the degree of susceptibility that they induced. A large difference in the duration of susceptibility was observed, however, with susceptibility being temporary following ampicillin, flucloxacillin, and cefuroxime administration but long-lived following clindamycin administration. A larger dose of ampicillin, multiple doses of ampicillin, and a combination of antibiotics had comparatively small effects on the duration of susceptibility. C. difficile growth and toxin production in in vitro suspensions of cecal contents were found to correlate closely with in vivo hamster infectivity. A persisting loss of colonization resistance following antibiotic treatment may be a type of postantibiotic effect. Although these results cannot be applied directly to humans, they suggest lines of further investigation into how antibiotics may differ in producing risks of C. difficile infection and pseudomembranous colitis in patients.\r"

  ".W": "Amphotericin B (AmB) is a potent antifungal polyene macrolide antibiotic and is the drug of choice for the treatment of deep-seated mycotic infections. Its use is limited, owing to its nephrotoxicity, and it must be dispersed in deoxycholate for parenteral administration. In contrast, AME (the monomethyl derivative of AmB) is water dispersible, is appreciably less cytotoxic than AmB toward a variety of cell types, and is reportedly active against the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus (human immunodeficiency virus type 1). The latter activity has generated interest in AME as an antiviral drug. However, AME is perceived to be neurotoxic, based on the outcome of a human clinical trial of AME as an antifungal drug. AmB is not regarded as neurotoxic, presumably because any neurotoxicity in vivo is precluded by its nephrotoxicity. It was important, therefore, to determine the potential for neurotoxicity of the two agents in comparative tests, assessing the effects of their direct action against neural cells in culture. Rat cortical cells, comprising astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, were used. AME was at least 10 times less toxic than AmB and equally less toxic against several other nonneural cell types also included in these tests. Equally important, AmB disrupted the myelin sheath in these cultures, and it inhibited its generation. AME did not, even at a concentration 10 times greater than the toxic concentration of AmB. AmB is, therefore, potentially more neurotoxic than AME, contrary to current perception. AME is effective as an antifungal and antiviral drug at a concentration far below its toxic concentration for neural cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These isolates included mucoid and nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. In addition to MICs measured under standard conditions, selected isolates were tested at various pH values, inoculum sizes, and diluent (CF serum and sputum) conditions. E-1040 activities (MICs for 50 and 90% of the strains) against the isolates were as follows: P. aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid), 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; P. cepacia, 4 and 16 micrograms/ml; S. aureus, 8 and 8 micrograms/ml; H. influenzae, 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; and E. coli, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. E-1040 activity against mucoid P. aeruginosa was 4-fold greater than that of aztreonam, 16-fold greater than that of ceftazidime, and 32-fold greater than that of piperacillin. E-1040 was similar to other broad-spectrum cephalosporins against S. aureus, H. influenzae, and E. coli. Bactericidal activity was less than or equal to 1 dilution of MIC for 88% of the strains, although kinetic studies with mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa demonstrated effective killing only at eight times the MIC. Variations in pH from 5 to 8, in inoculum size from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml, and in diluent (CF serum or CF sputum) did not affect E-1040 activity.\r"

  ".W": "Malarial parasites, in contrast to mammalian cells, utilize orotic acid more efficiently than uracil or uridine. Recently, chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant clones of Plasmodium falciparum were shown to be inhibited by 5-fluoroorotate, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 6 nM in vitro. Mammalian cells were far less sensitive to 5-fluoroorotate, particularly in the presence of uridine. In this report, the antimalarial activity of 5-fluoroorotate was tested in vivo. Initially, levels of 5-fluoroorotate in plasma were determined in Swiss mice injected intraperitoneally with radioactive 5-fluoroorotate. On the basis of the pharmacokinetics profile, mice infected with Plasmodium yoelii were treated with 5-fluoroorotate at a dose of 0.2 or 5 mg/kg (body weight) every 4 h for 3 days. At the nontoxic dose of 0.2 mg/kg, the reduction in parasitemia was followed by a temporary resurgence of parasitemia. This second wave of parasitemia cleared without additional 5-fluoroorotate treatment. To radically eliminate P. yoelii from mice and avoid the second wave of parasitemia, a higher dose of 5 mg of 5-fluoroorotate per kg had to be used. In the absence of uridine, repeated doses of 5 mg/kg were toxic to mice, as judged by weight loss, diarrhea, decreased numbers of leukocytes, and increased mortality. However, in the presence of uridine, repeated doses of 5 mg/kg could be used for antimalarial chemotherapy without obvious toxicity. Mice cured with 5-fluoroorotate and uridine were immune to subsequent challenge with a potentially lethal inoculum of P. yoelii.\r"

Although there are numerous antimicrobial agents that are effective against C. trachomatis, one of the most frequent combinations that is used to treat PID is clindamycin and gentamicin. The efficacy of clindamycin as the sole treatment for chlamydial infections has been questioned. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, Ga.) has recommended the use of doxycycline following clindamycin and gentamicin treatment of PID confirmed or suspected to be caused by C. trachomatis. This study was designed to determine whether there is any synergistic in vitro activity between clindamycin and gentamicin or tobramycin on inhibition of C. trachomatis replication. In this experiment, the MIC of clindamycin decreased two- to threefold when an aminoglycoside was added. This occurred even though aminoglycosides by themselves had essentially no effect against C. trachomatis. The mechanism of this interaction is uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "MICs of clarithromycin and its major human metabolite, 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin, for Haemophilus influenzae in combination were reduced two- to fourfold compared with the MICs of each compound alone. Serum reduced the MICs of the parent compound and metabolite two- to fourfold compared with the MICs in medium without serum. In serum spiked with clinically relevant concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin at a fixed ratio of 4:1, 15 of 16 strains (94%) were inhibited and killed by combinations containing 1.2 and 0.3 micrograms/ml, respectively. In time kill experiments, the combination of parent compound and metabolite at one-fourth and one-half of their individual MICs, respectively, reduced bacterial counts by greater than 5 log CFU. The postantibiotic effect of clarithromycin combined with 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin was twice that of clarithromycin when tested alone. When orally administered to gerbils with H. influenzae otitis media, the 14-hydroxy metabolite was significantly more active than clarithromycin in reducing bacterial counts from the middle ear. The in vivo activity of the two compounds in combination was synergistic or additive, depending on the level of H. influenzae present at the time treatment was initiated. Significant reductions in bacterial counts and increases in cure rates were observed when clarithromycin at 50 or 100 mg/kg of body weight was combined with 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin at 12 mg/kg or higher. Results from in vitro and in vivo combinations suggest that routine susceptibility tests and animal efficacy studies with clarithromycin alone may underestimate its potential efficacy against H. influenzae.\r"

  ".W": "2',3'-Dideoxycytidine (DDC) was evaluated for prophylactic antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo, using the feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-cat animal model. In vitro antiviral activity of DDC against FeLV was dependent upon the target cell used for infection. DDC (5 to 10 microM) inhibited FeLV infection of feline lymphoid cells by greater than 80%, while 6.07 to 12.13 microM DDC was required to similarly inhibit infection of feline fibroblasts. However, 43 to 384 microM DDC was needed to inhibit FeLV infection of primary bone marrow cells by greater than 80%. These in vitro results suggest that, although relatively low doses of DDC may be adequate to prevent infection of feline lymphoid cells, 8- to 80-times-higher doses may be necessary to block infection of bone marrow cells, a primary target cell type for FeLV infection. In vivo studies with DDC consisted of pharmacokinetic and toxicity determinations and evaluation of the prophylactic antiviral activity against FeLV in cats. Clearance and half-life values for DDC in cats were 6.5 ml/min per kg and 54.7 min, respectively. In the prophylactic studies, DDC was administered by continuous intravenous infusion at doses of 22, 15, 10, and 5 mg/kg per h for 28 days in most animals. Cats were challenged intravenously with FeLV 1 to 3 days after drug treatment began. Doses of 22 and 15 mg/kg per h were extremely toxic, causing death in 8 of 10 cats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Antibiotics are routinely used to assist in effecting a cure when infection is present. Nevertheless, for patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI), strategies for effective therapy with antibiotics based on measurement of concentrations in tissue and pharmacokinetic behavior in extravascular spaces do not exist. By analyzing the concentration-time profile and protein binding of amikacin in the interstitial fluid (IF) in contact with pressure sores, we found that the disposition of amikacin in the tissue contiguous with pressure sores appears to be governed by simultaneous first-order and capacity-limited pharmacokinetic behavior. Amikacin disposition in IF proceeded without a simple relationship to amikacin concentrations in serum, and the time course in IF was not accurately simulated by linear models of amikacin pharmacokinetic behavior. Total amikacin clearance estimated from a pharmacokinetic model using simultaneous first-order and nonlinear intercompartmental transfer of amikacin was not significantly different from clearance calculated by us in a prior study of amikacin pharmacokinetic behavior in patients with SCI. In patients with SCI, optimal use of amikacin in the treatment of infected pressure sores is contingent upon accurate characterization of the pharmacokinetic behavior of this aminoglycoside in serum and in the IF in contact with these lesions. Only methods which quantitate amikacin concentration and protein binding in IF and incorporate a model that can simultaneously simulate nonlinear and linear disposition processes should be relied upon to influence therapeutic decision making.\r"

While creatinine clearance increased significantly after the protein load in controls, it did not change in patients with either haemolytic uraemic syndrome or a single kidney. Basal microalbuminuria was significantly higher in those with haemolytic uraemic syndrome when compared with those with a single kidney and controls. It increased significantly in all groups after a water load; this increase was significantly higher in haemolytic uraemic syndrome. After the protein load microalbuminuria returned to baseline. In conclusion, children with a history of haemolytic uraemic syndrome have an abnormal renal functional reserve like children with a single kidney. Only patients with haemolytic uraemic syndrome exhibited an increased microalbuminuria, however, suggesting that it may be the expression of a pathophysiological mechanism involved in haemolytic uraemic syndrome and not in single kidney, that could account for their different prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Two prospective surveys of the immunisation state and its documentation were conducted among children under 2 years old attending a children's hospital. A survey of 111 children attending the casualty or outpatient departments showed that, according to reliable records, 106 (95%) were fully immunised for age with oral polio vaccine, 93 (84%) with triple antigen, and 26 of 33 children greater than or equal to 16 months of age (79%) with measles-mumps vaccine. A survey of 204 inpatients showed that, according to verified records, significantly fewer inpatients than outpatients were fully immunised for age with oral polio vaccine (176, 86%) and with triple antigen (144, 71%). The proportion of inpatients vaccinated with measles-mumps vaccine was 81% (48 of 59). The inpatient figures are all lower than the 95% goal of current child immunisation programmes. Although parents of 98% of inpatients had a personal health record for the child, it was available at the time of admission for less than half the children. Lack of use of the personal health record by admitting medical staff was reflected in incorrect or absent documentation of the immunisation state in 17 of 49 (35%) of the records of children verified to have inadequate immunisations. Parents and health care staff need to be educated in the optimal use of the personal health record. Hospital paediatric staff need to be encouraged to verify the immunisation state of all young children, on admission, and arrange to rectify any deficiency found.\r"

  ".U": "90351163\r", 
  ".W": "Serum antibody to lipopolysaccharide core glycolipid was measured in normal children and in full term and premature (less than or equal to 1500 g) infants. Antilipopolysaccharide core glycolipid antibody was present in term infants and normal children, and reached adult titres by 15 years of age. The specific anti core glycolipid antibody was predominately of the IgG class. Preterm infants (less than 32 weeks' gestation) had significantly lower titres of antilipopolysaccharide core glycolipid than more mature preterm or term infants. The results suggest that administration of anticore glycolipid immunoglobulin may be beneficial in the treatment or prevention of Gram negative septicaemia in preterm and very young infants.\r"

Measurements were made before treatment in the group with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia as well as when patients were both on and off chemotherapy. In the other two groups measurements were made when patients were both on and off treatment. Significant reductions in endotoxin antibody and serum immunoglobulin concentrations were found only in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In addition, there was a significant correlation between febrile episodes and the concentration of antibody to core glycolipid in the children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. These findings suggest that the use of prophylactic high titre endotoxin antibody may be of benefit to children with life threatening Gram negative infections who are receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of 46 infant deaths occurring between 3 and 100 weeks of age was performed and comprised a structured necropsy followed by collection of lung washings for surfactant phospholipid analysis and samples for microbiological examination. Of the 46 infants studied, 23 died from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) alone; SIDS was the cause of death in a further 12 but there were additional clinical or pathological findings insufficient in themselves to account for the death ('SIDS-plus'). In 11 there were other causes of death ('non-SIDS'). The lung washings from infants dying from SIDS had significantly lower concentrations of phosphatidylcholine and a significantly lower palmitate content in the phosphatidylcholine. There was no association between surfactant phospholipid abnormality and the presence of recognised pathogens, histological evidence of pulmonary inflammation, aspiration of stomach contents, age at death, sex, and death-postmortem interval. There were, however, lower concentrations of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine palmitate content in infants colonised by organisms with reported phospholipase A2 activity.\r"
