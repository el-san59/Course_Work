It is suitable for both endoscopic and open procedures, day-cases and in-patients. When used in day-case surgery it significantly improves overall efficiency. It is recognised that day-case surgery is an important and cost-effective element in surgical care. With increasing restraints being imposed upon hospital finances, patient beds and staffing levels, any strategies designed to improve efficiency in this sphere of surgical activity are to be welcomed. That 93% of patients prefer sedoanalgesia to conventional general anaesthesia attests to its high degree of acceptability. The technique of sedoanalgesia, its applications and potential impact for urology are detailed.\r"

Free and bound GLA have been reported to be found at higher concentrations in the urine of stone formers than controls. We have investigated the effect of GLA and calcium, at physiological levels, on the crystallisation of calcium oxalate using a mixed suspension mixed product removal continuous crystalliser. GLA caused very significant changes in the crystallisation kinetics, but the effect was dependent on the calcium concentration. At 4 mM calcium, GLA decreased the growth rate and increased the nucleation rate; at 12 mM the reverse occurred. At all concentrations of calcium tested, GLA caused a significantly increased crystal mass to be produced. Our evidence supports the hypothesis that GLA modifies calcium oxalate crystallisation and could be a promoter of stone formation in vivo, particularly at moderately elevated levels of calcium excretion.\r"

The records were available for study for 87 males and 11 females in the chronic dehydration group. The mean age at presentation was 43 years. The causes of chronic dehydration were hot climate (62%), with hot occupation and low water intake almost equal in second place. In patients with a single cause of chronic dehydration, 57% also had a dietary risk factor for urolithiasis and this was most commonly high oxalate intake. Following dietary advice, the mean urinary volume increased from 1720 to 2475 ml/24 h. This was accompanied by a rise in mean urinary calcium from 6.02 to 6.96 mmol/24 h, presumably due to the calcium in the additional water drunk. Urinary oxalate did not change significantly. The mean follow-up time was 4.85 years and the stone recurrence rate was low. It was concluded that chronic dehydration is a common cause of urolithiasis; this can be treated satisfactorily by increasing water intake plus dietary advice in certain cases.\r"

In 16 patients internal stents were placed at the time of reconstruction for primary ureteropyelostomy (3), secondary ureteropyelostomy (8), repeat reimplant (3) and repair of ureteric or pelviureteric junction injury (2). Complications included 3 episodes of transplant pyelonephritis, proximal stent migration (1), persistent bacteriuria (1) and prolonged healing of a ureteropyelostomy (1). Internalised ureteric stenting is a safe and effective means of managing or preventing ureteric reconstruction complications in renal transplant recipients.\r"

The indications were ureteric injury following hysterectomy, difficult forceps delivery, difficult ureterolithotomy, ureteric strictures caused by a Dormia basket and previous ureteric surgery, tuberculosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis and a post-ureteric reimplantation fistula. There were 2 patients with a solitary kidney and 2 in acute renal failure. Double J stenting was carried out in 11 patients and the stent was removed 3 to 6 weeks post-operatively. Good results, with no morbidity or mortality, were achieved in all but 1 patient where a simple Silastic stent had migrated to the pelvis and required open surgery to remove it. We attribute our success to the tension-free anastomosis, a wide based posterior flap with preservation of its vascular supply, the use of a double J stent and vicryl suture material.\r"

Partial occlusion of the bladder neck was obtained by the placement of a silk ligature at that level; control animals underwent a sham procedure. After a 3-month period, the presence of outflow tract obstruction was confirmed using urodynamic studies. The animals were then killed and pharmacological assessments of the bladder innervation undertaken. Detrusor muscle strip studies provided evidence of damage to the cholinergic innervation of the detrusor. Also, muscle strips from obstructed animals showed reduced inhibitory responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoprenaline. In addition to these muscle strip studies, the bladder content of the neuropeptide substance P was assayed, but no significant change was observed in response to obstruction. This finding suggests that substance P-containing sensory nerves may be spared from the denervating effect of bladder outflow obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Pressure variations in the urethra and bladder during stress episodes and their time separations were investigated in 30 healthy female volunteers. The pressure was measured by means of a double microtip transducer catheter with the distal sensor in the bladder and the proximal sensor at the bladder neck, the mid-urethra and the distal urethra. In advance of the pressure spike during cough a pressure rise was demonstrated in the bladder and at all 3 sites of measurement in the urethra. The urethral pressure increments preceding and following the pressure spike were statistically significantly higher in the mid-urethra than the corresponding bladder pressures. This active urethral pressure generation in the mid-urethra and distal urethra was initiated 200 ms before the bladder pressure began to rise. The pressure in the urethral high pressure zone was higher than the bladder pressure in all cases. Passive pressure transmission to the urethral high pressure zone can take place only insignificantly due to a continuous higher pressure inside the urethra than in the bladder and due to the location of the high pressure zone in the demarcation of the abdominal cavity. It was concluded that the urethral pressure rise in the high pressure zone during stress episodes is mainly generated actively by intra- and/or peri-urethral structures.\r"

The results demonstrated that of the 9 continuous cell lines tested, only those derived from the human prostate were growth inhibited by the pollen extract, whereas the non-prostate derived cells exhibited variable degrees of resistance to the T-60. The selectivity of the drug for the prostate cell lines was even more pronounced in the hormone-independent models, suggesting that there might be a place for the pollen extract in the control of abnormal growth in hormone-insensitive cells.\r"

  ".W": "Whilst prostatectomy remains the \"gold standard\" for the treatment of outflow tract obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, medical treatment--if only for symptomatic relief--appears to be an attractive alternative. Most of the pharmacological agents in use block the hormonal or the sympathetic neurological pathways that influence prostate growth and function. All of these drugs are known to have side effects. Sixty patients with outflow obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were entered into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of a 6-month course of the pollen extract, Cernilton. There was a statistically significant subjective improvement with Cernilton (69% of the patients) compared with placebo (30%). There was a significant decrease in residual urine in the patients treated with Cernilton and in the antero-posterior (A-P) diameter of the prostate on ultrasound. However, differences in respect of flow rate and voided volume were not statistically significant. It is concluded that Cernilton has a beneficial effect in BPH and may have a place in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate symptoms of outflow obstruction.\r"

The incidence of neuro-endocrine differentiation in prostatic carcinoma has varied considerably from 10 to 100%, but has not been studied previously as an independent factor affecting prognosis. Nucleolar organiser regions (NORs) are loops of ribosomal RNA occurring in the nucleoli of cells which ultimately process RNA genes. NORs have been demonstrated by silver (Ag) staining techniques and have been studied in numerous malignant tumours. A pilot study from this laboratory has shown a distinct and significant difference in AgNOR staining between prostatic carcinoma and benign prostatic epithelial hyperplasia. A retrospective study was performed with at least 6 years' follow-up. This confirmed the presence of neuro-endocrine cells in more than half of the patients under investigation. A significant correlation between survival and the absence of neuro-endocrine cells was demonstrated. AgNOR staining was shown to be of no prognostic value.\r"

Computed tomography in 108 patients presenting with symptoms, signs or biochemical results suggesting lymphatic spread revealed pelvic or abdominal node masses in 60 patients; in 29 (48%), the masses measured more than 4 cm and the maximum node diameter was 15 cm. Two-thirds of patients had advanced (T3/T4) tumour stage. Following treatment, actuarial survival in all 60 patients with nodal enlargement was 40% at 5 years. Within this group, survival in 22 patients with lymphadenopathy but negative bone scans at diagnosis was significantly better than that of 38 patients with both node and bone disease (70% vs 20% at 5 years). This improvement was related both to an apparent inability of certain tumours initially to progress and seed within bone and to a marked sensitivity of the node masses to subsequent hormonal manipulation. Primary tumour grade was proportionally similar in both groups. Unexpectedly, 6 of the 38 patients with combined disease obtained a complete remission after treatment. The reason for this heterogeneous biological behaviour remains unclear; but these observations underscore the importance of vigorous treatment in all patients with advanced lymph node disease.\r"

A decrease of more than 70% was always associated with fibrosis. A residual mass over 50 mm indicated viable tumour or mature teratoma. Seminoma or embryonal carcinoma was more likely to result in fibrosis/necrosis in the resected tissue. Both the Indiana and the EORTC classification models can be used for prognosis. Radiographic measurements before and after chemotherapy are of considerable prognostic significance. These objective indicators help in planning treatment and so diminish the side effects of therapy and maintain or even increase the high cure rate in disseminated testicular cancer.\r"

In a prospective screening study, 100 asymptomatic patients (80 men and 20 women) who had undergone truncal vagotomy at least 10 years previously were investigated by barium enema, colonoscopy and gallbladder ultrasonography. Control data were obtained from forensic autopsy subjects. The incidence of neoplasms greater than or equal to 1.0 cm in the vagotomized group was 14 per cent (11 adenomas, 3 carcinomas) and 3 per cent in controls (P = 0.01). Duodenal bile obtained at endoscopy from 21 vagotomized patients with normal gallbladders and from 21 control patients undergoing endoscopy was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The mean percentage of cholic (CA), chenodeoxycholic (CDCA), deoxycholic (DCA) and lithocholic (LCA) acids in the bile of vagotomized patients was 32.3, 45.6, 20.7 and 1.4 per cent respectively compared with 45.3, 36.2, 17.9 and 0.7 per cent respectively in controls. The increased proportions of CDCA and LCA and decreased proportions of CA in the duodenal bile of vagotomized patients were significant (P less than 0.001; P = 0.02; P = 0.007). Abnormalities in bile acid metabolism may help to explain the increased risk of colorectal neoplasia 10 years after truncal vagotomy.\r"

Although tissue factor (TF) is produced by certain tumours, and is increased in both tumour-associated macrophages and blood monocytes, the possibility that it might also be increased in urine has not been studied in patients with cancer. We have measured urinary PCA in hospital controls without inflammatory or neoplastic disease (n = 79), in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 8), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 19), colorectal cancer (n = 70) and in patients undergoing colonoscopy (n = 50). Urinary PCA was higher (P less than 0.001) in patients with colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease than controls or patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Fourteen (88 per cent) out of 16 colonoscopy patients subsequently found to have carcinoma or inflammatory bowel disease had levels above the control upper quartile, compared with 8 (24 per cent) out of 34 with normal colonoscopy (P less than 0.001). TF inhibitors confirmed the nature of the PCA and Western blotting studies indicated a urinary TF molecular weight of approximately 38,000. These studies provide further evidence of abnormal haemostasis in malignancy and suggest that determination of urinary TF may provide a useful screening test in patients undergoing colonoscopy.\r"

A water-soluble contrast enema was performed on the tenth postoperative day. Seventy-four patients were randomized to 'test' and 71 to 'no test' but one patient was withdrawn from each group leaving a total of 143 for analysis. The two groups were well matched for age, sex, diagnosis and operative details. Eighteen (25 per cent) air leaks were detected and repaired in the 'test' group. After operation there were three (4 per cent) clinical leaks in the 'test' group and ten (14 per cent) in the 'no test' group (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.043). There were eight (11 per cent) radiological leaks in the 'test' group and 20 (29 per cent) in the 'no test' group (P = 0.006). Intraoperative air testing and repair of colorectal anastomoses significantly reduces the risk of postoperative clinical and radiological leaks.\r"

The operative mortality rate was 3 per cent in group I and 11 per cent in group II (not a statistically significant difference). However, substantial differences were found for major morbidity (6 versus 44 per cent in groups I and II respectively; P less than 0.01) and mean length of hospital stay (17 days in group I versus 35 days in group II; P less than 0.05). All three patients who had on-table lavage developed anastomotic leaks which necessitated a second operation to form a stoma. Six patients (19 per cent) in group I required antidiarrhoeal medication in the immediate postoperative period. However, subsequent improvement in stool frequency was noted in all patients. It is concluded that subtotal/total colectomy is an acceptable means of managing patients with obstructing carcinoma of the left colon in that it is associated with a low morbidity and mortality rate and good functional results.\r"

However, the relationship between solid tumour development and the immune system is inconclusive. We have investigated an alternative mechanism involving the potential role of growth factors in this phenomenon. Using a human fibroblast: [125I]deoxyuridine uptake mitogenesis assay, the relative amounts of growth factor in the plasma of stored blood were measured. There was a progressive increase in mitogenesis from day 0 (n = 6) to day 28 (n = 6; P less than 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The effect of growth factors on the development of liver and intraperitoneal metastases was studied in Hooded Lister rats. Following an intraportal injection of 10(5) MC28 tumour cells, the experimental group (n = 25) received 2 ml of syngeneic serum intravenously for 4 days. Likewise, colonic anastomoses were performed on omentectomized rats and the peritoneal cavity seeded with 10(3) cells. The experimental groups (n = 20) received either 2 ml serum intravenously repeatedly or 3 ml serum intraperitoneally (n = 19). There was no significant increase in liver metastases or peritoneal disease following intravenous infusion of serum but serum delivered intraperitoneally resulted in a significant increase in tumour from 22 per cent in the controls to 89 per cent in the study group (P less than 0.01). Growth factors released from platelets following blood loss into the peritoneal cavity may be important in enhancing local recurrence of colorectal cancer.\r"

The response rate of those with cyclical mastalgia fell to 57 and 25 per cent for second and third line therapy respectively. Equivalent figures for non-cyclical mastalgia were 24 and 21 per cent. Danazol maintains a high response rate after the failure of other drugs, whereas the second line response to bromocriptine and evening primrose oil is poor.

This study used peripheral pulse oximetry in 20 healthy volunteers and in 20 patients with limb ischaemia. Pulse oximetry saturation levels (Psa,O2) were compared with ankle artery Doppler pressures and transcutaneous oxygen measurements (Ptc,O2). Recordings were taken at two standard sites distally and referenced to finger and forearm to calculate an index. A significant correlation was found between Ptc,O2 and Psa,O2 in patients with ischaemia (r = 0.68, P less than 0.01). A further group of 12 patients with acute limb ischaemia was similarly assessed before and after revascularization. After revascularization mean(s.d.) Ptc,O2 increased from 38(13) to 44(1) mmHg (P greater than 0.05) and mean(s.d.) Psa,O2 increased from 86(3) to 90(4) per cent (P less than 0.01). These data suggest that pulse oximetry is a more sensitive index of peripheral perfusion than Ptc,O2 or ankle artery Doppler pressure and that, because of its accuracy and simplicity, it merits further use.\r"

Thirty patients had had previous unsuccessful vascular reconstructive surgery and five had had a failed femoral embolectomy. The through-knee disarticulation used lateral skin flaps. The mortality was 21 (20 per cent). Of the 83 survivors, 59 (71 per cent) underwent uncomplicated primary wound healing; 36 (43 per cent) of the survivors were unsuitable for rehabilitation on a prosthesis. The remaining 47 (57 per cent) were walking before discharge 30-130 days (mean 68 days) after amputation. Through-knee amputation is a rapid, relatively bloodless, amputation and is a useful debridement procedure. The many surgical and functional advantages, in conjunction with the recent reports of better rehabilitation compared with the above-knee or Gritti-Stokes amputation, suggests that the through-knee amputation deserves greater consideration.\r"

The overall incidence of stenoses was 16 per cent (femorocrural 20 per cent, femoropopliteal 15 per cent). All stenoses were detected in the first year after operation and none occurred after this. Twenty-four non-haemodynamically significant stenoses were not treated but were followed at intervals of 3 months. Forty-two haemodynamically significant stenoses were detected and secondary procedures were performed in 30 grafts at a mean of 8 months after surgery. Thirteen had percutaneous balloon dilatation and six (46 per cent) remain patent at a mean follow-up of 22 months. Two grafts which occluded within 30 days and three which restenosed at a mean of 8 months had tertiary procedures. Seventeen grafts were surgically revised, nine with patch grafts and eight with bypass grafts. Eleven of these remain patent at a mean follow-up of 30 months. One occluded immediately and three occluded late. Two grafts which restenosed at a mean of 19 months had successful tertiary procedures. In total, seven grafts had tertiary procedures (two had balloon dilatation and five had surgery) and six of these remain patent at a mean follow-up of 13.5 months. In conclusion, 37 procedures have been performed on 30 grafts, of which 23 (77 per cent) remain patent at a mean follow-up of 12 months. Approximately one-quarter of femorodistal grafts will develop graft-related stenoses and graft surveillance is worthwhile, but only for the first year after operation.\r"

  ".W": "Over the four years from 1 January 1985 to 31 December 1988, 192 patients were treated for aortoiliac occlusive disease by the Oxford Regional Vascular Service. The number of patients treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty increased from two in the first year of the study to 34 in the third year of the study. This increase was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of patients treated by aortobifemoral bypass but the proportion of patients treated by extra-anatomic bypass remained constant at around 30 per cent. Twice as many patients were treated in the fourth year as in the first year of the study so that the number of surgical operations increased despite many patients being treated exclusively by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The number of patients requiring mandatory treatment for limb salvage increased by 109 per cent and optional treatment for intermittent claudication by 85 per cent. The introduction of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in Oxford has coincided with an increase in the number of patients presenting with symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease and has allowed twice as many people to be treated while the number of aortobifemoral bypass operations has remained unchanged. It is concluded that the introduction of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has not only generated its own workload but has also led to an increased demand for surgical reconstruction for aortoiliac occlusive disease.\r"

  ".W": "Historical review shows that the treatment of popliteal aneurysm has developed by trial and error and there is disagreement about the proper management of the symptomless patient. In 1981 a policy of conservative management for asymptomatic popliteal aneurysm was adopted in this unit. Since that time we have also managed nine patients with thrombosed popliteal aneurysms by arteriography and low-dose intra-arterial streptokinase. Six patients treated within 72 h of occlusion achieved significant (70-100 per cent) lysis, but streptokinase was ineffective in those treated 10 or more days after the thrombosis. Of the six patients with significant lysis, three were treated by elective reconstruction and two by anticoagulation. One patient who had significant lysis died. Vascular patency of all five successfully treated limbs was maintained and no limb loss occurred in those who presented late and failed to achieve significant lysis. These results reinforce the view that thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for thrombosed popliteal aneurysms. The low complication rate for asymptomatic popliteal aneurysms and the advent of safe, effective thrombolysis indicate that operation for symptomless popliteal aneurysm is no longer required.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous streptokinase infusions (100,000 units/h) have been used to treat 48 patients, with 50 episodes of acute limb ischaemia who were unlikely to benefit from a surgical approach. These included 17 acute thromboses, 14 late or distal emboli and 19 bypass graft occlusions. Overall, 17 (34 per cent) instances had complete lysis with reappearance of distal pulses and a further 28 per cent had clinical improvement without change in pulse status. Final outcome after 30 days was limb salvage in 60 per cent, amputation in 24 per cent and death in 16 per cent, but this was achieved after eight patients without lysis had vascular reconstructive surgery. Serious complications were infrequent, but included a fatal stroke, a haematemesis and two episodes of distal embolization. The outcome was not related to the duration of ischaemia or the site of occlusion. Lysis was more frequent with emboli (50 per cent) and graft occlusions (47 per cent) than arterial thromboses (6 per cent). Limb salvage was more likely in patients with no neurological deficit in the limb (70 per cent) than if a deficit was present (37 per cent). In conclusion, intravenous streptokinase produced a moderate benefit with low morbidity and has a role in acute limb ischaemia if surgery is inappropriate and intra-arterial lysis unavailable. In particular, selected patients with emboli or graft occlusions without a neurological deficit may be most suitable.\r"

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed on 84 occasions with a 73 per cent success rate for visualization of the main pancreatic duct. On-table pancreatography (OTP) was performed by one of five different techniques: retrograde, prograde or ambigrade ductography, cystography and ascending loopography after pancreaticojejunostomy. OTP provided important information about the main pancreatic duct when endoscopic visualization was unsuccessful (n = 23), incomplete (n = 17) or not performed (n = 33); there was a failure rate of 4 per cent. In 35 patients either the additional information or discrepancies between ERCP and OTP findings resulted in a change of operative plan (19 extra procedures, 16 altered procedures). Complete ductography was especially helpful in the 63 patients with chronic pancreatitis. OTP is technically simple, free from complications and invaluable for planning operative strategy.\r"

Groups were matched on the basis of tumour location and swallowing was graded clinically before and after treatment. Technical success was achieved in 17 of 20 laser treated and 18 of 20 intubated patients. Pretreatment swallowing ability, histology, tumour location and overall length were unrelated to functional outcome in both groups. However, circumferential tumour length identified endoscopically strongly influenced the quality of swallowing after laser recanalization. Patients with excellent swallowing quality (n = 7) had significantly shorter circumferential tumour lengths, 3.1(1.0) cm, than those with poorer quality swallowing (n = 10), 6.3(1.6)cm, (P less than 0.001). Both methods of treatment had low complication rates and there was one death in the series in the laser-treated group. Laser recanalization provides a better functional result than intubation for short (less than 4 cm) circumferential tumour. Intubation at a single session seems more appropriate than repeated laser therapy when tumour length exceeds 4 cm.\r"

Surgeons showed mean scores significantly higher than the general population on two subscales of the mental health index (free-floating anxiety and hysterical anxiety).

To determine the correlation between steroid therapy and such morbidity, the perioperative course of 55 steroid-treated patients was reviewed: 27 had bronchopulmonary disorders (group P) and 28 had non-pulmonary diseases (group NP). There were six (11 per cent) deaths, of which three were steroid related. Among the 13 non-lethal postoperative complications, eight were considered to be steroid related in group P and one in group NP. The duration of steroid therapy was for a median of 24 months (range 1-408 months) in group P and for a median of 6 months (range 1-240 months) in group NP (P less than 0.01). In contrast, the daily dose of hydrocortisone or equivalent before operation was significantly lower in group P, with a median of 0.51 mg kg-1 day-1 (range 0.20-2.56 mg kg-1 day-1) than in group NP, with a median of 1.20 mg kg-1 day-1 (range 0.23-7.38 mg kg-1 day-1) (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, bronchopulmonary disorders requiring a long duration of steroid therapy are associated with a higher risk of steroid-related complications after surgery. A convenient mathematical model is proposed which may allow a preoperative assessment of surgical risk, using steroid dose and duration of treatment.\r"

In this study, the cytochemical measurement of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was used to detect abnormal metabolism in breast tissue and to determine whether abnormal metabolic activity precedes morphological change during human breast carcinogenesis. Normal and benign breast tissue, morphologically normal tissue from cancer-containing breasts, and malignant breast tissue were studied. In malignant tissue, mean(s.e.m.) G6PD activity was significantly increased when compared with normal and benign tissue (9.69(2.3) versus 27.02(1.7) mean integrated extinction (MIE) x 100, P less than 0.01). G6PD activity was increased in morphologically normal tissue from cancer-containing breasts when compared with normal and benign breast tissue from breasts with no known cancer (27.02(1.7) versus 18.42(2.6) MIE x 100, P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that metabolic abnormalities precede morphological changes in breast carcinogenesis. Abnormal metabolism can be detected widely within a cancer-containing breast. The detection of such abnormality may prove helpful in identifying patients at high risk of developing breast cancer.\r"

  ".U": "91028944\r", 
  ".W": "Repeat cesarean section is a major factor contributing to the rising cesarean section rate. Although vaginal birth after a previous cesarean section (VBAC) is advocated in most cases, it has not yet been adopted as widespread policy. In a case-control study we compared 400 women in Quebec who underwent VBAC with 1600 women who had a repeat cesarean section from 1985 to 1987 in an attempt to identify factors that favour vaginal delivery. Using both simple and multiple logistic regression analyses we examined the effect of independent variables linked to the patients (two variables), the attending physicians (seven) and the hospitals (two) on the dependent variable (type of birth) with the use of odds ratios. We found that the physician characteristics related to type of practice and the degree of hospital specialization were significant factors in predicting the type of delivery. Women who gave birth vaginally were more likely than those who had a repeat cesarean section to be attended by a physician with a specialized practice and to give birth in a hospital providing an intermediate or high level of care. This suggests that VBAC is still perceived as a high-risk option and is managed by only a minority of specialized obstetricians.\r"

We conducted a telephone survey to determine the status of utilization management in Canadian hospitals. The sample comprised a random selection of 30% of acute-care hospitals with over 100 beds for adults in Ontario and Quebec and all such hospitals in the other provinces. Of the 123 chief executive officers contacted 99 (80%) claimed to have a utilization management program. Of those, 90 (91%) agreed to participate in an in-depth survey or to designate a senior administrator to be interviewed who was most knowledgeable about the program. High occupancy rates and funding issues were the most common environmental triggers for the development of utilization management programs; funding issues were listed more frequently by respondents in Ontario than by those elsewhere (p = 0.0008). Retrospective review alone was used in half of the hospitals, concurrent review or some mixed approach being used in the other half. Ontario and the Atlantic provinces were more reliant than the rest of the country on retrospective review alone (p = 0.0032). Most of the hospitals used peer review and education to stimulate corrective action. Of the respondents 67% indicated that the medical staff supported the utilization management program, and 53% reported that the program had a positive impact on the relationship between administrative and medical staff. Most of the respondents were unsure of the program's impact on the quality of care or the rate of unnecessary hospital admission. However, retrospective review alone was found to be less successful in reducing inappropriate utilization than either concurrent review or combined review (p = 0.0048).\r"

Physicians should routinely ask patients about alcohol intake. In light of evidence on the effectiveness of brief interventions, especially with heavy-drinking but nondependent patients, physicians' treatment efforts should be focused in this direction. Patients who are alcohol dependent might best be treated by nonphysicians. Research contributions of physicians should be concentrated on topics for which physician input is needed: longitudinal studies of health consequences, factors contributing to mortality and health service costs, biochemical markers of alcohol use and basic pharmacology. Strong evidence links population alcohol consumption levels to overall harm. Therefore, prevention efforts should be aimed at the population as well as at people who may be at risk. Physicians can contribute to these efforts by influencing public policy and by setting healthy examples in their own alcohol use.\r"

Despite this agreement and the acknowledged high prevalence of alcohol problems in clinical populations, medical school coverage of these problems is not proportional to their importance. Barriers to adequate coverage of alcohol problems are traditional attitudes, confusion as to whether such problems are \"medical\" and lack of adequate faculty role models. These problems could be remedied by encouragement and training of interested faculty members, establishment of substance abuse centres in university medical schools, integration of alcohol-related material with relevant topics in all departments and inclusion of alcohol-related questions on medical qualifying exams.\r"

However, a small but often highly visible minority--approximately 5% of the adult population--show major symptoms of alcohol dependence. Between these extremes, there is a sizable group of about 20% of the population, particularly young men, who are drinking at risk levels and have encountered some problems related to their alcohol use. Traditionally, physicians' efforts have focused on diagnosing and treating patients with a substantial history of alcohol dependence, and relatively little attention has been given to early intervention with nondependent problem drinkers, such as identifying patients who present in primary care settings with alcohol-related morbidity or an accidental injury. Recent evidence indicates that early intervention by primary care physicians is an effective strategy for reducing alcohol problems among patients.\r"

Several reports from expert committees have recommended new initiatives in the secondary prevention of alcohol problems through physician-based interventions at the primary care level. The conceptual and scientific bases for these recommendations are discussed in terms of recent studies of harmful and hazardous drinkers. The behavioural principles thought to account for the effectiveness of brief interventions are explained. Despite these promising developments, difficulties are inherent in the introduction of new technologies, especially behavioural technologies, into medical practice. A major challenge to medical education will be the development of academic programs that not only teach skills and competencies in secondary prevention but also deal with the socialization of physicians as behavioural practitioners.\r"

Current training is variable and was seen as inadequate, with more time devoted to treatment than prevention. To correct this situation, renewed priorities and faculty leadership are needed.

An undergraduate core curriculum, developed in the early 1970s, is offered in year 2; it has been supplemented by electives, selectives and comprehensive clinics. The undergraduate program is rated highly by students; since 1978, 3024 have completed the core program. Residency training started in 1974 and is available through electives lasting from 1 to 12 months in internal medicine, psychiatry, and family and community medicine. To date, 370 residents have completed one of these electives; 129 have completed graduate programs in which their theses concerned alcohol- and drug-related topics, and there have been an additional 13 research and postdoctoral fellows. Despite the progress, there is still a need to improve and expand the undergraduate and residency programs and to develop an effective program of continuing medical education. The goals should be to ensure that, as far as possible, all medical graduates from the University of Toronto have the knowledge, attitudes, skills and behaviours needed to contribute effectively to the prevention and treatment of alcohol- and drug-related problems in their chosen field of practice and to avoid problems from their personal use of alcohol and other drugs.\r"

Since the initial placebo-controlled trial showing improved survival among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or symptomatic HIV infection (AIDS-related complex [ARC]) zidovudine has been evaluated in other stages of HIV infection. This review offers physicians who treat patients with HIV infection a comprehensive analysis of the current data on the clinical efficacy of zidovudine in various stages of HIV infection and on zidovudine's adverse effects. After a search of MEDLINE for pertinent articles published since 1985, controlled studies and studies of long-term zidovudine therapy, of zidovudine therapy for HIV-related conditions and of the incidence and management of adverse reactions were evaluated. In addition, abstracts from international meetings were reviewed. No significant difference in clinical outcome was found between high-dose and low-dose zidovudine therapy, but there were significantly fewer toxic effects in the low-dose group. In two other studies zidovudine was found to delay disease progression in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV infection who had an absolute CD4 count of less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L; the low incidence of adverse reactions may have been due to either the early stage of the infection or the low dose used. The demonstration of zidovudine-resistant isolates after at least 6 months of therapy has yet to be correlated with clinical deterioration. When to begin zidovudine therapy among asymptomatic patients with a CD4 count of less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L remains unclear. Zidovudine can be used safely to delay progression to AIDS or ARC in certain patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV infection and can prolong survival in those with more severe infection. Further studies are necessary to identify indicators that could better define when to start treatment and how to alleviate toxic effects. Combination therapy with such agents as interferon alpha may become the preferred choice of therapy to prevent toxic effects and zidovudine resistance. Zidovudine prophylaxis has been used after HIV exposure. Although studies with animal models have had encouraging results infection has occurred despite immediate prophylaxis and thus further investigation is required.\r"

  ".W": "We performed an anonymous seroprevalence survey of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection through HIV antibody testing of blood samples from 22,512 women aged 15 to 44 years receiving prenatal care in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory from Mar. 15 to Sept. 30, 1989. Of the samples six were confirmed to be HIV positive; this yielded a crude overall seroprevalence rate of 2.7 per 10,000 pregnant women (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 5.8). All of the positive samples were from women 20 to 29 years of age; four were from Vancouver, one was from Victoria, and one was from elsewhere. The highest seroprevalence rates were among women aged 15 to 29 years in Vancouver and Victoria (7.2 and 9.4 per 10,000 pregnant women respectively). Thus, 1 in 1300 pregnant women in that age group in the metropolitan areas of British Columbia was HIV positive. Application of seroprevalence rates to the total female population in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory revealed that as many as 401 women had HIV infection in 1989. Our estimates likely represent the minimum. As a subset of women of childbearing age pregnant women are likely at lowest risk of HIV infection, and so the true number of women 15 to 44 years of age with HIV infection is probably several times higher. Our study has provided a baseline assessment and will be repeated annually to analyse trends in HIV seroprevalence among pregnant women in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory.\r"

  ".W": "The office practices of 918 physicians selected through stratified random sampling from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) registry were assessed by peers and the Peer Assessment Committee of the CPSO from 1981 to 1985. The sample comprised 662 general practitioners (GPs) and family physicians (FPs) and 256 specialists in 11 fields. Of the physicians 749 (82%) had neither deficient records nor an unsatisfactory level of patient care. Of the GPs and FPs 97 (15%) had serious deficiencies in one or both areas, as compared with 4 (2%) of the specialists (p2 less than 0.00001). The proportions of certificants of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and of the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) with serious deficiencies were low (2% and 3% respectively). Three statistically significant predictors of physician performance were found among the GPs and FPs: age, CFPC membership status and type of practice. Of the 56 physicians who were reassessed 6 to 12 months later 29 (52%) had made the improvements recommended by the committee. Our findings demonstrate the need, feasibility and acceptance of a peer assessment program of office practices in Ontario.\r"

  ".W": "Herpesvirus simiae (B virus) causes a mild infection in macaques. Transmission to humans may result in life-threatening encephalomyelitis. To evaluate the risk of occupational exposure to B virus we surveyed the directors of 11 biomedical laboratories in Quebec that use monkeys. Information was obtained on the monkey population and on the use of infection control measures recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta. Of the 519 monkeys belonging to susceptible species the serologic status was positive in 264 (51%), all captured in the wilds, and it was unknown in 24 (5%). All of the monkeys were caged individually, and newly acquired ones were quarantined for 2 to 8 weeks. Of the 84 workers 52 (62%) handled monkeys whose serologic status was either positive or unknown. Only five laboratories (representing 61% of the workers) complied fully with the CDC guidelines. Nine of the laboratories had a wound management protocol, but only six had a designated specialist for consultation and prophylaxis. Although no cases of B virus infection have been reported from Quebec the severity of human illness necessitates strict adherence to infection control measures and expert management of occupational exposure to susceptible monkeys.\r"

  ".W": "Erythema infectiosum, an acute, communicable viral disease with a highly distinctive exanthem, follows the usual course of a self-limiting benign disease. In pregnant women, however, it may be associated with fetal death and nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Because of the association of human parvovirus (HPV) B19 infection with fetal damage we reviewed the current knowledge of the clinical aspects of erythema infectiosum, focusing on pregnancy and fetal outcome, to determine the magnitude of fetal risk and offer recommendations for management. Among 180 infected pregnant women 44 fetal deaths (24%) occurred, 1 to 12 weeks after the infection was noted. Pregnant women should be advised that (a) because of the high prevalence (up to 65%) of anti-HPV B19 IgG antibody among adults most of them are not at risk and (b) if maternal infection does occur therapeutic abortion is not indicated since intrauterine infection causes fetal death more often than abnormal development. Infection should be suspected in pregnant women who exhibit the symptoms of erythema infectiosum with or without arthropathy. They should be monitored for an elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level (indicating fetal aplastic crisis) and undergo serial ultrasonography for the detection of hydrops fetalis. Although the incidence of congenital malformation is no higher than the expected rate in the general population (3% to 5%), the precise incidence of fetal adverse outcomes remains unknown and requires investigation in larger, prospective studies.\r"

The self-administered questionnaire was completed by 428 of 804 family physicians and general practitioners. The proportion of physicians who reported having tested at least 50% of their adult patients varied from 29% to 85% and was related to the number of CHD risk factors present and the patient's age. The proportion of respondents who reported starting dietary or drug therapy among patients with a cholesterol level of 6.2 mmol/L or less increased as the number of CHD risk factors increased and was not related to patient age or sex. According to the factors examined our results suggest that primary care physicians in Canada select patients for screening and treatment mainly on the basis of CHD risk factors present and that their approach is more conservative than that recommended by the Canadian and US consensus conferences.\r"

Of the 68,808 samples tested 42 were confirmed as positive, for an overall crude seroprevalence rate of 6.1 per 10,000 live births (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4 to 8.3), or 1 woman in 1638. Women who lived on Montreal island had an overall rate of 17.9 per 10,000 live births (95% CI 12.2 to 25.4), or 1 woman in 559. We observed a significant association between revenue index and seroprevalence; the rates were as high as 46.4 per 10,000 live births (95% CI 18.7 to 95.3), or 1 woman in 216, for Montreal island postal code areas with revenue indexes 20% or more below the provincial median. Extrapolation of the data suggested that 56 women with HIV infection gave birth to a live infant during 1989 in Quebec. Even though attempts to generalize the data from childbearing women to women of childbearing age have an inherent conservative bias, the results of our study suggest that 988 women (95% CI 713 to 1336) aged 15 to 44 years in Quebec had HIV infection in 1989. The actual number is likely substantially higher. The need for well-designed, creative interventions to prevent further HIV transmission to women is evident. Planning for the provision of medical and psychosocial services sensitive to specific needs of women who are already infected should start immediately.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the incidence of Haemophilus influenzae resistance to selected antimicrobials used in Canada. From 1985 to 1987, 2503 H. influenzae isolates obtained in 14 hospitals across Canada were sent to the Centre hospitalier de l'universite Laval (CHUL) for identification, serotyping, biotyping and testing for beta-lactamase production. Susceptibility tests were done with the use of 12 antibiotics. Of the strains 424 (16.9%) produced beta-lactamase; the proportion varied from 12.8%, in Newfoundland, to 19.6%, in Ontario. Of the strains 18.3% were type b; 19.4% of those produced beta-lactamase. Almost 82% of the strains were not type b. The proportion of beta-lactamase-producing strains varied according to the isolation site, from 15.3% in the respiratory tract to 25.6% in the blood. The overall level of resistance was 19.3% to ampicillin, 24.2% to erythromycin, 3.8% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 1.7% to amoxicillin-potassium clavulanate, 1.4% to cefaclor, 1.3% to tetracycline, 1.0% to rifampin, 0.7% to cefuroxime and 0.1% to cefamandole. Disc diffusion susceptibility testing revealed 64 strains (2.6%) that did not produce beta-lactamase but were resistant to ampicillin and 9 (0.4%) that produced beta-lactamase but were susceptible to ampicillin. The results of beta-lactamase production tests were identical regardless of whether the tests were done by the CHUL or by the other hospitals, but there was a marked difference in the susceptibility test results between the CHUL and the other centres. Our results suggest that the level of resistance of H. influenzae to antibiotics is increasing in Canada and that the initial choice of drug therapy may have to be modified.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred forty-two foci of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) from 47 patients were examined for amplification of myc family oncogenes (c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc), by dot blot hybridization using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded materials which were resected surgically or obtained at autopsy. Some selected patients were also examined by in situ hybridization. Amplification of myc family genes was detected in 11 patients (23.4%) (c-myc in one, N-myc in five, and L-myc in five). Two of the 11 patients (one with N-myc and one with L-myc) had heterogenously amplified clones. In the patient with N-myc amplification, amplification was detected in metastatic tumors in the pancreas, lung, and pleura, but not in the liver and lymph node metastases. In the primary tumor, areas with and without N-myc amplification were seen. In the patient with L-myc amplification, although amplification was not detected in the surgically resected primary lesion, mediastinal lymph node metastatic lesions obtained at autopsy showed L-myc gene amplification. These two cases, together with previously reported evidence, suggest that myc gene amplification plays an important role in malignant progression, rather than development, of SCLC. In Stage III and IV groups, patients with over ten-fold myc gene amplification were suggested to survive for a shorter time than patients without such amplification (P = 0.06).\r"

The dose-limiting factor is myelotoxicity with mild extramedullary toxicity. This Phase I study consisted of adult patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies. Eight patients received a total of 15 treatment courses of DWA. The starting dose was 800 mg/m2 over 24 hours by continuous infusion. The dose was first increased to 1200 mg/m2 and then to 1600 mg/m2. Clinical toxicity and urinary excretion studies of DWA suggested that 1200 mg/m2/d for successive days would be the best type of administration. When 1200 mg/m2/d was given for 5 days, Grade 2 to 3 diarrhea and nausea and vomiting were encountered requiring parenteral fluids and nutritional support. This suggested that the dose-limiting factor with this schedule was gastrointestinal toxicity. Myelotoxicity was severe, as expected, but tolerable. One of the five patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) entered into complete remission and one patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in crisis returned to the chronic phase. A Phase II trial of DWA is warranted for hematologic malignancies, especially in myeloid diseases.\r"

There were four cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, two cases of fibrosarcoma, four cases of neuroblastoma, and one case each of germ cell tumor, Wilm's tumor, retinoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma. All eligible patients had advanced diseases and had previously received extensive chemotherapy. Thirteen patients received one course of HDAC and three patients received two courses of HDAC. Due to prior treatments, patients had less than normal marrow reserves. Short-term toxicity included nausea, vomiting, suppression of hemopoiesis, drug fever, and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. All evaluable patients recovered from their toxicities. There were no drug-related deaths. None of the patients had neurologic problems, including the only patient with prior irradiation to the skull. With the above schedule, HDAC appears to have manageable toxicity.\r"

To detect early esophageal cancer, endoscopic screening of the esophagus with the Lugol dye method was performed in patients with head and neck cancers who were asymptomatic but regarded as being at high risk for synchronous or metachronous esophageal cancer. Of 178 patients screened, 9 had esophageal cancer (5.1%). Eight of these patients (89%) were at early stages with no lymph node metastasis. Most of the lesions (9 of 13 lesions) were not detectable by barium studies or ordinary endoscopic study. The epidemiologic statistical analysis of the patients confirmed that they had a significantly high observed and expected number (O/E) ratio (39.7; P less than 0.001). These results demonstrate the value of endoscopic screening of the esophagus with the Lugol dye method in patients with head and neck cancers and imply that endoscopic screening with the Lugol dye method may be useful for detecting early esophageal cancer in individuals at risk for other causes.\r"

  ".W": "A major objective of the second Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS-II) (1978 to 1984) was to preserve the bladder without compromising the survival of children with localized genitourinary sarcomas arising in or near the bladder. After incisional biopsy, 109 patients with localized, gross residual sarcoma of the prostate (43 patients), bladder (43 patients), vagina (20 patients), or cervix/uterine corpus (3 patients) were treated with vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC). After two to four drug courses, radiation therapy and/or surgery were used to treat patients with residual or recurrent tumor. The 3-year survival rate of patients treated on this primary chemotherapy regimen (70%) was similar to that of the primary surgery regimens of IRS-I (78%; P = 0.46), but the 3-year disease-free survival rate was significantly inferior (52% versus 70%; P = 0.02). Since the IRS-II encouraged bladder preservation at the onset of therapy, the percentage of patients with bladder and prostate tumors who retained the bladder was initially substantially higher in IRS-II (97%) than in IRS-I (58%). However, the percentages of 95 patients with bladder-prostate (BP) tumors in IRS-II who retained the bladder and were alive at 2 and 3 years after starting treatment were only 33% and 22%, respectively, compared with 26% and 23%, respectively, in the 66 patients with BP tumors in IRS-I. Thus, sequential treatment with primary chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy and/or surgery as given in IRS-II, failed to improve the eventual bladder salvage rate.\r"

Twenty-six had minimal prior therapy (good risk), 23 had extensive prior therapy (poor risk), and six had renal and/or hepatic dysfunction. A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg/m2 were evaluable. Maximum tolerated dose in good-risk patients was 70 mg/m2, and in poor-risk patients, 60 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative granulocytopenia. Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 (range, 4-22). Less frequent toxic effects included thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, mild alopecia, phlebitis, and mucositis. Myelosuppression was more in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed Pirarubicin plasma T 1/2 alpha (+/- SE) of 2.5 +/- 0.85 minutes, T beta 1/2 of 25.6 +/- 6.5 minutes, and T 1/2 gamma of 23.6 +/- 7.6 hours. The area under the curve was 537 +/- 149 ng/ml x hours, volume of distribution (Vd) 3504 +/- 644 l/m2, and total clearance (ClT) was 204 + 39.3 l/hour/m2. Adriamycinol, doxorubicin, adriamycinone, and tetrahydropyranyladriamycinol were the metabolites detected in plasma and the amount of doxorubicin was less than or equal to 10% of the total metabolites. Urinary excretion of Pirarubicin in the first 24 hours was less than or equal to 10%. Activity was noted in mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma, and basal cell carcinoma. The recommended starting dose for Phase II trials is 60 mg/m2 IV bolus every 3 weeks.\r"

The chief presenting feature at relapse was painless testicular enlargement, as is also seen in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who relapse in the testes. By French-American-British convention, the malignant cells were classified as M4 (myelomonoblastic) in four cases and M2 (myeloblastic) in one. All children received a course of multiagent reinduction chemotherapy and all but one received local irradiation to the testes. Only one of these children, whose relapse was a late event after elective cessation of therapy, is a long-term survivor. A comparison with six previously published cases shows similar clinical characteristics and outcome. Given the poor responses of such patients to conventional treatment, it seems worthwhile to consider the use of intensive reinduction chemotherapy with concomitant bilateral testicular irradiation followed by remission intensification and an autologous or allogenic marrow transplant.\r"

The cortical stroma showed moderate to severe signs of fibrosis and changes of capillaries.

There was preoperative evidence of extracranial disease in 11 patients. Eight patients had more than one intracranial metastasis at operation. Intraoperative ultrasound was used in 18 of the 19 craniotomies to minimize surgical trauma to the brain. The 30-day mortality was zero. The 30-day morbidity was minimal. No patient acquired a new neurologic deficit as a result of surgery. All patients regained at least their preoperative level of functioning. Six of the patients who were living at the time of review have been followed for 4 to 25 months (median, 7.5 months). The seven patients who were dead at the time of review survived 4 to 18 months (median, 10 months). These results compare favorably with the survival of untreated patients with metastatic melanoma to the brain (median, 1 month), patients treated with radiation therapy alone (median, 2-4 months), and those treated with chemotherapy alone (median, 2-4 months). The excision of metastatic melanoma from the brain, although not curative, may increase survival in patients with this problem with little morbidity and mortality even in the presence of other metastases.\r"

However, loss of staining within the most invasive sites of the tumors correlated significantly with the stage of tumor development and histologic grade of malignancy.

In those with SCLC, specific somatostatin receptor binding was evidenced only in tumor foci and not in surrounding stroma or normal lung parenchyma. Further tissue characterization by immunoperoxidase staining with the pancytokeratin monoclonal antibody, mAB-lu-5, revealed labeling to all of the NSCLC but to none of the SCLC specimen. Selective immunoreactivity was detected in both the SCLC and the NSCLC specimen to chromogranin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) whereas none of the specimen had detectable immunostaining to somatostatin, bombesin, serotonin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, neurofilament, calcitonin, and synaptophysin.

  ".U": "91029068\r", 
  ".W": "The normal pancreas consists of three major cell types or lineages that share a common embryologic origin from pluripotent endodermal precursors. The type of cell that undergoes neoplastic transformation to form a pancreatic carcinoma is controversial and may influence the phenotype and biologic behavior of the tumor. In this study, immunohistologic techniques were used to determine the cell lineage differentiation expressed in 29 primary exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas, five metastatic exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and five islet cell neoplasma. Specimens of normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis were used for comparison. The cell lineage markers consisted of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against trypsin and lipase (acinar cells); secretory component, carbonic anhydrase II, and pancreatic cancer mucin SPan-1 (ductal cells); and chromogranin-A and somatostatin (islet cells). The expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and lysozyme were also determined. This collection of markers allowed the differentiation between acinar, ductal, and islet cells of normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis specimens. The expression of cell lineage markers in islet cell tumors was homogeneous and restricted to chromogranin-A. In contrast, the expression of these markers in primary and metastatic exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas was variable. Reactivity with monoclonal anti-CEA was absent in normal pancreas, and was present in 83% of chronic pancreatitis specimens as well as 90% of exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In addition, lysozyme reactivity was absent in normal pancreas; however, lysozyme was expressed in one case of chronic pancreatitis, 17 cases of primary carcinoma, and three cases of metastatic carcinoma. These findings support the concept that the original transformed cell type in many pancreatic exocrine carcinomas resemble endodermal \"stem cells\" that retain the capability of differentiation along more than one cell lineage pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The altered expression of the human retinoblastoma (RB) gene has been demonstrated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of RB and other tumors. To determine whether the RB gene might be involved in the pathogenesis of human ovarian and endometrial cancer, DNA from 24 human ovarian tumors, 3 normal ovaries, 3 endometrial carcinomas, and 1 endometrial hyperplasia was examined with an RB complementary DNA probe. Evidence for homozygous deletion of the RB gene was observed in only one specimen. Interestingly, the specimen was an endometrioid tumor of the ovary of low malignant potential (LMP). This patient experienced rapid progression of the tumor and died 8 months after diagnosis. Abnormalities of the RB gene may be involved in the aggressive biologic behavior of certain forms of ovarian carcinoma, particularly those of LMP.\r"

Of the five HPV types examined (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33), HPV 16 DNA was detected most frequently. In most HPV 16-positive carcinomas examined, HPV 16 DNA was present in an integrated state in cellular DNA with or without the coexistence of episomal species. In one case, however, only episomal species were detected. Among seven cases of HPV 16-positive CIN, four contained HPV 16 DNA only in the episomal state and the rest contained HPV 16 DNA only in the integrated state, but the coexistence of both states was not found. These results suggest that the integration of HPV 16 DNA is not necessary for cells to become malignant, although it is frequently associated with malignant cells.\r"

In order to evaluate humoral immunity in gastric cancer, distribution of immunoglobulins (Ig) and secretory component was immunohistochemically studied in 74 early and 15 advanced primary gastric cancers. In non-cancerous gastric mucosa, IgA and IgM, and secretory component were mainly identified in the cytoplasm of the intestinal metaplasia. In early gastric cancer of well-differentiated type, the localization of IgA and IgM, and secretory component was similar to that of intestinal metaplasia. In advanced gastric cancer, they were faintly observed and showed low positivity. The number of Ig-containing cells infiltrating cancerous stroma was enumerated. Immunoglobulin A-containing cells were dominant in the stroma of early gastric cancer. On the other hand, there were few Ig-containing cells in the stroma of advanced gastric cancer, and the number of IgA-containing and IgM-containing cells was also decreased. These results suggest that local humoral immunity is suppressed in gastric cancer, especially in advanced gastric cancer.\r"

  ".W": "All 240 consecutive cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that underwent autopsy at the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between September 1962 and August 1986 were reviewed. Among these cases, 162, for which photographs of cut surfaces of the primary tumors were available, were grossly classified using a combination of both Eggel's classification and our own into three major types, i.e., nodular, massive, and diffuse as described by Eggel (Eggel H, Beitr Pathol Anat 1901; 30:506-604), and three subgroups of nodular type, i.e., single nodular type (type 1), single nodular type with extranodular growth (type 2), and contiguous multinodular type (type 3) by our classification (Kanai T et al., Cancer 1987; 60:810-819). Seventy-eight cases were classified as nodular type, comprising seven cases of type 1, 61 cases of type 2, and ten cases of type 3. Sixty-seven and 17 cases were classified as massive and diffuse type, respectively. Of the 78 nodular-type tumors, 59 measured less than 10 cm, whereas 64 of 67 massive-type tumors were 10 cm or more in size. The incidence of intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor spread of HCC was significantly higher for tumors measuring more than 5 cm. As to the relationship between macroscopic type and tumor spread, the frequency of spread was lowest for type 1 tumors, and high for the other types. Intrahepatic metastasis was detected in 28.6% of type 1, 93.4% of type 2, 100% of type 3, and 98.5% of massive-type tumors. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 24.6% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 38.8% of massive-type and 52.9% of diffuse-type tumors. Hematogenous extrahepatic metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 47.5% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 74.6% of massive-type and 82.4% of diffuse-type tumors. It appears that not only primary tumor size but also its macroscopic type has an important influence on the growth and spread of HCC.\r"

DNA content was determined by image analysis on Feulgen-stained nuclear smears prepared from multiple paraffin blocks from each tumor. Tumors were unilateral in four cases and bilateral in three. Ten tumors had homogeneous, and four heterogeneous DNA stemlines. Intertumoral heterogeneity in four cases suggested multifocal origin. Identical DNA aneuploid indices in bilateral tumors in one case suggested metastasis from a solitary origin. Abnormal DNA content and heterogeneous populations began to appear in the size range 2.0 to 5.0 cm. All tumors over 5.0 cm contained nondiploid populations. Although the interrelationships between these multiple synchronous neoplasms are not entirely clear, the DNA analysis suggests that the occurrence of nondiploid stemlines and heterogeneous DNA content may parallel both tumor growth and more aggressive behavior.\r"

Tumors studied were from 31 men and 29 women whose ages ranged from 18 to 62 years (median, 29 years). The most common sites were the distal end of the femur and proximal end of the tibia, accounting for 75% of the lesions. Treatment consisted of resection in 29 patients (48%), curettage with bone chip packing in 15 patients (25%), or curettage with cement packing in 16 patients (27%). Ten patients (17%) had local relapse within 1 to 3 years, and two had lung metastases. Forty-two patients (70%) exhibited tumors with a diploid DNA content, 16 aneuploid (27%), and two tetraploid (3%). Six (37.5%) of the aneuploid patients had relapses: one of those had been treated by resection of the tumor and five by curettage. Of the remaining ten (62.5%) unrelapsed aneuploid patients, nine had been treated by resection of the tumor and one by curettage. Four of the 42 diploid patients (9.5%) had relapses; all had been treated by curettage of the tumor. The two tetraploid tumors were treated by resection and none relapsed. Histologic parameters did not correlate with relapse rate or DNA pattern. Although relapse was more common among aneuploid tumors, our study shows that this appears to be influenced by the treatment modality rather than the ploidy status. Based on this study the DNA analysis of giant cell tumor of bone has a limited utility for predicting the tumor's biologic behavior.\r"

Treatment protocol provided 45 minutes of heating at the intratumor temperature of at least 42 degrees C, twice a week, for a total number of six, eight, or ten heating sessions. Invasive intratumor thermometry was performed for all lesions. Complete response (CR) was obtained in ten cases (16.6%) and partial response (PR) in 14 (23.4%). Higher rates of CR were observed in the chest wall (38.5%) compared with the head and neck area (11.4%), trunk (10%), and limbs (none). Adenocarcinoma was the most responsive histologic type (40%). Squamous cells carcinoma had 7.7% CR. The only case of undifferentiated carcinoma showed CR; there were none on five sarcomas. Long-term local control (24 months) was approximately 7%. The multivariate analysis showed the statistical significance of the histologic variety (adenocarcinoma versus others, P less than 0.0001). Side effects and complications of the treatment were minimal.\r"

  ".W": "A prior study of Hodgkin's disease (HD) incidence using national cancer survey data (1969-1980) identified unprecedented rate declines among white persons older than 40 years, and rate increases among young adults aged 15 through 39. These trends could be due to improved diagnostic accuracy. To investigate this hypothesis, the authors updated incidence rates in whites by age, sex, and histologic subtype through 1984; quantified diagnostic accuracy in corresponding detail using Repository Center for Lymphoma Clinical Studies data, which include original and expert review diagnoses on lymphoma patients; and recalculated HD incidence rates (1969-1984) corrected for diagnostic error. Updated HD incidence rates through 1984 continued to decline in older adults and showed persistent increases for young adults with the nodular sclerosis (NS) histologic subtype. The percentage of original HD diagnoses confirmed on review (confirmation rate) decreased with age and increased over time; in older adults, these patterns opposed observed incidence trends. However, for young adults, confirmation rates of NS, the most common subtype at these ages, were high and changed little over time. After adjustment for diagnostic error, incidence rates for older adults were lower than previously observed and showed no secular changes. However, young adults with NS had slightly larger rate increases than in uncorrected data. Thus, contemporary changes in HD incidence for whites primarily involve growing risk to persons at the start of adult life. These patterns are compatible with trends in suspected sociodemographic risk factors that suggest an infectious etiology for HD.\r"

Forty-one of them (68%) had clinically localized (Stage I and II) disease which often spread locally to neighboring tissues and they presented predominantly with nasal symptoms. Nasal lymphoma appeared to carry a poor prognosis. Although our patients with clinically localized disease had significantly better prognosis than those with advanced disease, the 5-year survival of Stage I and II patients was only 55%. Chemotherapy did not appear to be more effective than radiotherapy alone in preventing relapses but the patient number was too small to allow a firm conclusion to be made. Patients with advanced disease had even poorer prognosis with a 5-year survival of only 17%. Innovative therapy has to be developed for these patients.\r"

Four of those cases (18%) had a single nodule smaller than 1 cm in diameter, and 11 cases (50%) had a single nodule smaller than 2 cm. Surgical resection was performed on 12 cases (55%). In comparison with the control group (83 HCC cases not receiving any periodic checkup), the frequency of small liver cancer and the surgical resection rate in the study group were significantly higher.

Among vaginal and vaginal/exocervical cases, this sensitivity was 72%; specificity was 60%; and the majority of these mothers who said they did not take DES were DES positive by written records. Thus investigators should avoid using maternal recall alone to measure DES exposure. Among subjects for whom written maternal obstetric records were available, 88% of vaginal cases and 46% of cervical cases were DES positive. The authors conclude that few cases of vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma should occur in young women as the cohort of women exposed in utero to DES continues to age, whereas cases of cervical origin may continue to occur.\r"

Unfortunately, the patient's family history of cancer is often given minimal attention, and knowledge of hereditary cancer syndromes is frequently limited. Indeed, many physicians still consider familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as the only genetic risk factor for colorectal cancer. This concern with FAP was noted in a colorectal cancer-prone kindred which for decades had been thought to manifest that syndrome. However, after meticulous genetic, medical, and pathologic studies, the cardinal phenotypic characteristics of Lynch syndrome II were observed. The potential for cancer control in current and future generations of families like this one clearly mandates the need for computerized registries which could transmit current information about hereditary colon cancer syndrome diagnosis, surveillance, and management.\r"

The current study represents an extension of our earlier work in which the authors found an excess of breast cancer in the mothers of 143 of these children. There were 40 cancers among all first-degree relatives, compared with 24.82 expected (relative risk [RR] 1.61, P = 0.006). There was no excess in fathers, but an excess of borderline significance was seen in mothers (RR 1.67, P = 0.0545), and a significant excess in siblings (RR 4.55, P = 0.0002), mainly due to carcinoma of the breast and pediatric tumors. Results of a step forward Cox multivariate analysis identified three variables in the index child which were independently associated with high cancer risk in relatives, as follows: age younger than 24 months at diagnosis; histologic type, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma or other and unspecified soft tissue sarcoma; and male sex. It was possible, therefore, to identify a subgroup of children whose relatives are at high risk of early onset cancer (RR in this group 10.14). The pattern of cancers is consistent with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The authors conclude that a marked proportion of childhood soft tissue sarcoma has a genetic basis.\r"

Two hundred patients with adenocarcinoma of the cecum or ascending colon (diagnosed between 1984 and 1989) were compared with 200 matched neighborhood controls. Cholecystectomy history was obtained through interviews using structured questionnaires and subsequently validated from hospital records. A statistically significant association (odds ratio = 2.14) was found between right colon cancer and a history of prior cholecystectomy. The altered bile metabolism which occurs after removal of the gallbladder may have a carcinogenic effect on the right colon. Dietary habits of the colon cancer patients in our study were consistent with prior reports in the literature, showing that this group has a lower intake of vegetables and cereal fiber than the control population.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred twenty-four eligible patients with advanced mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were entered into a pilot study of concomitant cisplatin (100 mg/m2 given every 3 weeks for three doses) and standard irradiation. The initial complete response (CR) was 71% with an additional two cases salvaged by surgery for an overall 73% CR. When no keratin was identified in the histologic specimen (41 patients) the CR was 90%. The nasopharynx showed the best CR (89%) among the sites. At 4 years after treatment, the estimated locoregional tumor control rate was 43% and the survival, 34%. When no keratin was present in the specimen, the estimated locoregional control of tumor was superior (56% versus 38% with keratin identified, P = 0.02) and the estimated survival was also superior (48% versus 26%, P = 0.008). Acute treatment-related toxicities included one death due to renal damage and two patients with life-threatening renal damage. The delivery of radiotherapy was not altered. Late toxicity included necrosis -3%, fibrosis -4%, and one fistula. The results of this study justify a randomized trial for the comparison of this combination of cisplatin and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in advanced mucosal carcinomas of the head and neck.\r"

The mean duration of therapy was 5 months (range, 2 to 24 months). A partial response was observed in 29 patients (48.3%) and the disease was stabilized in 18 additional patients (30%). Bleomycin failed in 21.6% of patients. Therapy had to be discontinued in two patients because of side effects. Thus bleomycin as a single agent is a good alternative therapy for AIDS-related KS.\r"

The treatment regimen consisted of a 100 mg/m2 1 hour IV infusion every week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a 4- to 5-week rest period (induction therapy). In responding or stabilized patients, maintenance therapy consisted of 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks until the disease progressed. One hundred fifty-three patients were evaluable for response. Three complete responses and 34 partial responses were observed (according to the World Health Organization criteria), leading to an objective response rate of 24.2% (95% confidence interval: 17.4% to 31.0%). Responses were also documented on cerebral (25.0%), visceral (19.2%), or nonvisceral (31.8%) metastatic sites. The median duration of response was 22 weeks (range, 7 to 80 weeks). The objective response rate in previously untreated patients was 30.7% (19 of 62 patients). The main toxicity was hematologic with delayed and reversible leukopenia and/or thrombopenia. The objective response rate observed (especially in untreated patients), the activity on cerebral metastases, and the small amount of extra-hematologic toxicity encountered suggest that fotemustine is an effective drug in disseminated malignant melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred nine newly treated patients with advanced neuroblastoma were entered in this study between January 1985 and May 1989. The eligible patients included infants younger than 12 months of age with Stage IVA disease (bone cortex, distant lymph node, and/or remote organ metastases) and patients aged 12 months or older with Stage III or IV disease (IVA plus IVB with tumor crossing the mid-line and with metastases confined to bone marrow, liver, and skin). The patients first received six cyclic course of intensive chemotherapy (regimen A1), consisting of cyclophosphamide (1200 mg/m2), vincristine (1.5 mg/m2), tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin (pyrarubicin; 40 mg/m2), and cisplatin (90 mg/m2). Original tumors and the regional lymph node metastases were removed some time during these first six cycles of chemotherapy. The patients were further divided into three groups. Patients in course 1 received alternating treatment by regimen B (cyclophosphamide and ACNU) and intensified regimen A1, and those in course 2 were treated with alternating administration of regimen C (cyclophosphamide and DTIC) and intensified A1. Patients in course 3 were treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) preceded by high-dose preconditioning chemotherapy. Survival rates were 77% in Stage III and 54% in Stage IV at 2 years, and 70% in Stage III and 45% in Stage IV at 3 years. The major toxicities encountered were bone marrow suppression with leukocyte counts down to 100/mm3, mild cystitis, and hearing impairment. The 2-year survival rate was 78% in 21 patients who underwent BMT when complete remission was achieved. We concluded that our intensive induction chemotherapy is of significant value in increasing the rate of complete response, and in widening the indications for and achieving improved results of treatment with BMT.\r"

  ".W": "In 1978, Cancer and Leukemia Group B initiated a randomized study to determine the usefulness of the addition of bleomycin and/or high-dose methotrexate to standard therapy for the treatment of certain adult non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Between 1978 and 1985, 177 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) and 97 patients with other intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were randomized to receive therapy with three courses of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) every 3 weeks with or without low-dose bleomycin by continuous IV infusion. Responders after three courses were further randomized to 3 weeks of therapy with either high-dose methotrexate (3 gm/m2/week intravenously with leucovorin rescue) or standard-dose methotrexate (30 mg/m2/week orally without rescue). Therapy was concluded with three additional courses of CHOP. Neither the addition of low-dose infusion bleomycin nor the use of high-dose rather than low-dose methotrexate had significant effects on response for patients with DLCL; complete response rates for the four treatment programs ranged from 47% to 51%. Median failure-free survival (FFS) for the entire group of DLCL patients was 12 months; 5-year FFS was 27%. There was no significant effect on FFS from the addition of either low-dose bleomycin to CHOP (5-year FFS: CHOP, 28%; CHOP-B, 26%, P = 0.81), or from the use of different doses of methotrexate (5-year FFS: high-dose, 34%; standard-dose, 33%, P = 0.51). Patients with follicular large cell lymphoma, with or without diffuse areas, had a better FFS (5-year FFS, 47%) than patients with DLCL (5-year FFS, 27%), while the patients with the other histopathologic subtypes of diffuse lymphomas had the poorest FFS (5-year FFS, 16%).\r"

Groups of three to five patients were treated with 50, 100, 200, and 400 micrograms/m2 per day of rhG-CSF by intravenous infusion for 14 days, beginning 3 days after chemotherapy. There was a strong linear relationship between the dose and the area under the curve over this dose range. The rhG-CSF was rapidly cleared from serum, with a mean half-life of 5.97 hours for the second phase (t1/2). In patients treated with a dose of more than 100 micrograms/m2 per day, the duration of neutropenia (P less than 0.01) and the duration of fever (P less than 0.05) were significantly decreased. The rhG-CSF was well tolerated and the only clinical observation that appeared relating to rhG-CSF administration was slight bone pain. This study strongly suggests that an optimum dose of rhG-CSF in patients after chemotherapy is 100 to 200 micrograms/m2. Our study shows that rhG-CSF is a clinically useful drug for patients treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy.\r"

Kaplan-Meier survival curves with Cox-Mantel analysis for statistical significance revealed both grade and stage to be excellent predictors of survival. No differences in survival were noted between renal pelvic and ureteral carcinomas for equivalent stage tumors. For low grade, low stage tumors, although there was an increased risk of local recurrence with local therapy, there were no differences in survival between patients treated with local therapy or radical surgery.

The latent periods varied from 8 to 11 years from completion of radiotherapy treatment to development of osteosarcoma. The radiation dosage varied from 6000 to 6280 cGy in three of the patients. These cases fit the criteria for diagnosis of postirradiation sarcomas. Maxillary osteosarcomas after irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma do not appear to have been described. The very high incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (for which radiotherapy is the treatment of choice) in Hong Kong Chinese would make the occurrence of such tumors more likely in Hong Kong, although the small risk does not contraindicate the use of radiation in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in view of its well-documented efficacy.\r"

In 15 cases radical prostatectomy was performed with the entire prostate embedded for thorough evaluation of grade, volume, and stage of tumor at the needle biopsy site as well as of multifocal tumor. Eight specimens had solitary low grade and low volume tumor, with only one of these cases showing minimal capsular penetration and the others confined to the prostate. Four cases had low-grade tumor at the biopsy site, yet multifocal higher grade tumor. All of these tumor nodules were low volume and confined to the prostate. In three cases there was both low-grade and high-grade tumor in the nodule sampled by needle biopsy. In two of these cases the tumor was large and in the third it was small but mostly higher grade, with two of these cases showing capsular penetration. Although transrectal ultrasound and repeat needle biopsy would most likely have identified either the tumors' large size or high-grade component in these latter three cases, it is unlikely that these techniques would have identified the cases of multifocal higher grade tumor because of their relatively small size. Furthermore, preoperative serum prostate specific antigen levels and clinical stage failed to distinguish those cases with higher grade tumor. Because of the difficulty in identifying these areas of high-grade tumor preoperatively, it is uncertain whether expectant therapy could be recommended even for patients with very low-grade cancer on needle biopsy.\r"

These immunologic defects are supposed to be related to genetic and/or environmental factors. In this study, 65 first-degree relatives and 12 spouses of 21 consecutive patients with HD were studied immunologically. Furthermore, seven twin pairs in which one partner had HD and four additional nonmatched healthy co-twins were also included in the study. A decreased lymphocyte DNA synthesis induced by Concanavalin A, a high spontaneous DNA synthesis, or a low CD4+/8+ ratio was found in 21 (32%) consanguineous, two (17%) nonconsanguineous relatives, and five (50%) healthy co-twins. The corresponding figures for the untreated patients with HD and the control series were 14 of 21 (65%) and 21 of 127 (16%), respectively. Total lymphocyte counts or lymphocyte subpopulations did not differ between HD relatives and controls. The increased frequency of blood lymphocyte defects among consanguineous first-degree relatives favors the existence of a genetically determined immune deficiency in at least a proportion of apparently healthy relatives of patients with HD. However, nongenetic factors such as age and environment may add to the defect.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by peripheral blood macrophages was investigated in breast cancer. Whereas spontaneous TNF production by macrophages derived from patients with breast cancer was comparable with the one found in healthy controls (P greater than 0.1), LPS-stimulated macrophages derived from patients in the disease-free interval as well as with metastatic breast cancer were found to produce significantly lower amounts of TNF, as compared with macrophages derived from healthy control individuals (P less than 0.0005). However, the production of TNF did not significantly differ between the two patient populations (P greater than 0.05). The impairment of LPS-induced TNF production did not depend upon such characteristics of the primary tumor as size, axillary lymph node and estrogen receptor status, or upon the fact of administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and, in patients with metastatic disease, hormone treatment. To further investigate cytokine production by macrophages, spontaneous and LPS-induced interleukin-1 (IL-1) production was investigated also. However, no difference was found between patients and controls concerning IL-1 generation. The authors thus conclude that LPS-induced TNF production was impaired in breast cancer independent of the presence of detectable metastatic disease, whereas IL-1 production remained unimpaired.\r"

Upon clinical observation, MPA has been shown to improve life quality and overall well-being in patients with advanced breast cancer, renal carcinoma, prostatic carcinoma, and uterine adenocarcinoma. The authors have evaluated MPA endocrine action by the administration of human corticotropin releasing factor (hCRF) in a 90-minute assay in 15 patients with advanced breast cancer or renal cell carcinoma both, before the initiation of oral high-dose MPA treatment (1000 mg MPA) as well as after at least 10 days of therapy. The curves for corticotropin, beta-endorphin, and cortisol responses to hCRF of tumor patients who were tested before the initiation of MPA treatment were parallel to the curves of a healthy control group of probands tested under equal conditions, although at significantly higher respective hormone levels. In patients with malignant disorders assayed after MPA administration, both basal and peak hormone levels were found to be comparable with values obtained in healthy controls. In conclusion, MPA appeared to act at a suprapituitary level since pituitary responsiveness to hCRF was preserved under MPA treatment. Moreover, it appeared that MPA brought the hormonal stress state found in patients with malignant tumors back to normal.\r"

Patients with the hereditary form of retinoblastoma carry a germ line mutation at one of the two homologous gene loci in all cells and have an increased risk for nonocular tumors (mainly osteosarcoma and other mesenchymal tumors) in later life. The authors studied a 38-year-old patient with sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) who had been treated for bilateral retinoblastoma by enucleation (left eye) and irradiation (right eye), respectively. Using molecular probes for the RB-1 gene and other loci on chromosome 13, the authors detected a deletion at the RB-1 locus in metastatic SNUC cells that was not present in normal tissue. These findings indicate that somatic mutations at RB-1 locus may be involved in the formation or progression of ectodermal tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Colon cancers typically produce mucin. However, it is not known whether tumor mucin plays a biological role in cancer cell behavior. To address this issue, the expression of a mucin-associated antigen, sialosyl-Tn, was examined by immunohistochemical study in 128 primary colorectal carcinoma specimens from 137 patients who underwent curative surgical resection. Antigen expression was correlated with disease-free and overall 5-year survival. Sialosyl-Tn antigen expression occurred in 112 (87.5%) tumors, and was independent of age, gender, tumor location, Dukes' stage, depth of invasion, degree of differentiation, and ploidy status. Survival at 5 years for patients with sialosyl-Tn-negative versus sialosyl-Tn-positive tumors was 100% versus 73% (P less than 0.05) and disease-free survival was 94% versus 73%, respectively (P = 0.12). Although more advanced Dukes' stage, deeper invasion, and aneuploidy were all associated with poorer overall 5-year survival, antigen-negative tumors within each of these groups had much better prognoses than antigen-positive tumors. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that tumor ploidy (P less than 0.001) and sialosyl-Tn expression (P less than 0.05) were the two variables of most importance for predicting both disease-free and overall survival. The authors conclude that sialosyl-Tn expression is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in colon cancer, and therefore suggest that qualitative mucin alterations may reflect important differences in the biological behavior of these neoplasms.\r"

This study compares EGF receptors in normal and neoplastic endometrium. Membrane fractions were isolated from surgical specimens. Radioreceptor assays demonstrated the presence of receptors with a dissociation constant of 0.64 nmol/l in normal endometrium. Affinity cross-linking revealed receptor molecular weight of 150 to 170 kiloDaltons (KD). A survey of samples (n = 37) revealed progressive decrease of EGF receptors in cancers of increasing grade: Grade 1-2 adenocarcinoma decreased 34% from control (n = 6, P less than 0.01), whereas Grade 3 adenocarcinoma decreased 90% (n = 7, P less than 0.01) and sarcoma decreased by 72% (n = 3, P less than 0.01). The dissociation constant and molecular weight of the receptor in neoplastic endometrium did not differ significantly from normal. The inverse relationship with grade suggests receptor alteration or down regulation by hormones and/or growth factors.\r"

More precise grading of this type of sarcoma is desirable. The rate of cell proliferation may reflect clinical behavior. A more sensitive measure of cell proliferation is the expression of the Ki-67 antigen. Frozen sections were prepared from 29 cases of MFH. Sections were immunohistochemically stained for Ki-67, and the results were quantitated by image analysis (CAS 100). The Spearman rank correlation test was used to compare the extent of the Ki-67 staining with the conventional histologic grade, nuclear grade, number of mitoses, extent of necrosis, and overall cellularity. There was a significant correlation between the extent of Ki-67 staining and the nuclear grade (cc = 0.56; P = 0.002) and overall histologic grade (correlation coefficient = 0.58; P = 0.001), but there was no significant, independent correlation between Ki-67 and prognosis.\r"

These patients formed 27.2% of 433 consecutive cases of NHL seen in a single institution over a 5-year period. Thirty-one of 433 NHL cases were histologically not classified, whereas the remaining 402 could be classified according to the International Working Formulation (WF) of NHL for clinical usage. Immunophenotypic analyses were carried out in 112 NHL cases; of this group 28 were NHL in elderly patients. Of the 95 elderly NHL that could be classified in the histologic categories of the WF 28 cases were in the low-grade, 41 in the intermediate-grade, and 26 in the high-grade categories. Eighty-one cases had diffuse histologic types and 14 had follicular/nodular histologic types. Thirty-five cases were of the G (diffuse large cell) + H (large cell, immunoblastic) categories. No significant differences in the prevalence of the different subtypes were observed among patients younger or older than 70 years. Immunohistologically, most NHL cases in the elderly expressed B-cell phenotype. Sixty-two NHL in the elderly were extranodal at presentation. The results of this study indicate that elderly patients form a relevant proportion of patients developing NHL and thereby present a very difficult management problem. The pathologic features of NHL in the elderly does not differ significantly from those of their younger counterparts, although an increase in diffuse versus follicular histologic patterns, and in extranodal versus nodal disease was observed with advancing age.\r"

Therefore, the authors performed a clinicopathologic study to determine the biologic course of diffuse ILL (40 cases) and compared it with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL; 51 cases) and diffuse small cleaved cell lymphoma (DSCCL; 14 cases). They found that patients with diffuse ILL having pseudofollicular proliferation centers (PC) had a significantly longer median survival (84 months) than those without PC (46.5 months; P = 0.03). The median survival of patients with SLL was 72 months, whereas those with DSCCL had a median survival of only 18 months. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that diffuse ILL with PC should be included in the low-grade category of SLL for clinical purposes, whereas diffuse ILL without PC (true diffuse ILL) should be considered an intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. True diffuse ILL is similar to centrocytic lymphoma in the Kiel classification and should be accorded a similar status in a modified Working Formulation.\r"

The sensitivity of FS diagnosis of malignancy was 53% and the specificity and positive predictive value 100%. The negative predictive value was 97.8% and overall accuracy 97.9%. The PS disclosed a malignant neoplasm in 62% of specimens in which FS diagnosis was \"deferred.\" Sixty-eight percent of papillary carcinomas, 87% of undifferentiated carcinomas, and a single case of medullary carcinoma were diagnosed with FS examination. A FS diagnosis of malignancy was not made in any of the ten specimens containing follicular carcinoma; in all ten the neoplasms were well-differentiated and eight were encapsulated and minimally invasive. The inability to diagnose follicular carcinoma intraoperatively with FS is the most significant factor accounting for the relatively low sensitivity of FS diagnosis of malignant thyroid neoplasms.\r"

However, routine cerebral staging in these patients did not seem to be useful because of lack of therapeutic consequences. On the other hand, no patient with non-small cell carcinoma (N-SCC) and tumor Stage I or II had brain metastases. All patients with brain metastasis from N-SCC had been classified as tumor Stage III before cerebral imaging. Among these patients, however, the authors found brain metastasis in 17.5% of those without known distant metastatic disease (III/M0), especially in large cell carcinoma and in adenocarcinoma. Stage III/M0 patients should undergo routine cerebral imaging if their tumor is surgically resectable and thoracotomy is planned.\r"

Dendritic cell infiltration was graded as \"slight\" and \"marked.\" The 39% frequency in the marked infiltration group at the mucosal stage did not change in proportion to invasion into the deeper layers. The 5-year survival rate was 60.4% in patients with marked infiltration and 38.8% in those with slight infiltration, which was statistically different (P less than 0.01). The difference in survival rates was only statistically significant in those with cancer emerging from the serosa (P less than 0.001). There was a similar incidence of lymph node metastasis between the marked and slight infiltration groups in each grade of tumor invasion. However, marked infiltration of dendritic cells prevented widespread nodal involvement beyond the primary node in cases of advanced carcinoma (P less than 0.05). These findings indicate that infiltrating dendritic cells do not prevent the spread of tumor invasion but do prevent nodal involvement; therefore, for patients with a gastric cancer emerging from the serosa, the prognosis will be good.\r"

Villus-like changes and angular infolding, cytologic nuclear pleomorphism, distinct nuclear border, irregular thickness of the nuclear membrane, irregular chromatin clumping, prominent nucleoli, and distinct nucleoli were manifestations of the carcinoma group. Angular infolding, distinct nuclear border, irregular thickness of the nuclear membrane, and distinct nucleoli were also observed in the latent stage before detection of carcinoma. The individual features, however, lacked specificity. Histochemically, a IIB subtype of intestinal metaplasia, and immunoreactive CEA in the cytoplasm of foveolar epithelium appeared exclusively in the patients with carcinoma. These findings indicate that the gastric epithelium of patients with gastric carcinoma tends to be morphologically and histochemically abnormal even before the recognition of classical dysplasia. This can be described as abnormal epithelium and is believed to provide the soil on which gastric carcinoma develops.\r"

These analyses also revealed those factors that were significantly related to MFS at one or several stages and losing their significance at a subsequent stage. This was the case with clinical node status, age, and vascular tumor emboli. Other factors such as estrogen, progesterone, histologic grade, and clinical stage were never identified as independent factors at any stage. The four major stable risk factors were used to define a stratification of reference. The results demonstrated that the mere knowledge of clinical information such as tumor size, clinical node status, and age would enable 51% of the patients to be universally well classified according to that stratification. Knowledge of additional factors, such as nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic index, would bring the rate up to 61%, and then to 64% if supplementary information such as vascular tumor emboli were acquired. These percentages did not appear high enough to claim that the physician may make a reliable prognosis of operable breast cancer patients before acquiring information from the axillary node dissection. However, it was proven that there exist some subsets of patients with stable prognosis, i.e., subsets of patients who will belong permanently to the same risk group through the stages.\r"

Crude and age-adjusted (world population) incidence rates of gastric cancer were 34.0 and 21.4 new cases/100,000/year, respectively, in men, and 24.5 and 10.9 in women, respectively. Among first-degree relatives of the registered patients there were 30 cases of gastric carcinoma versus 15 cases in a control group matched for age and sex (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio [M-H OR] 3.14, P less than 0.01). This excess of gastric neoplasms was observed in siblings (17 versus 7, M-H OR 4.33, P less than 0.02) but not in parents (13 versus 8, not significant). Besides gastric cancer, there was no significant excess of other type of tumors in case families. The familial occurrence of gastric cancer tended to be more frequent in patients with \"diffuse\" carcinoma (52%) than in subjects with \"intestinal\" cancer (33%), although the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the current investigation suggests that a \"family history\" for gastric neoplasms is usually observed in approximately 10% to 15% of the registered cases. As already described for other common malignancies, therefore, the familial occurrence of gastric carcinoma suggests the existence of a genetic susceptibility to cancer of the stomach, at least in a fraction of these patients.\r"

Major determinants for successful angioplasty in these patients are guiding catheter selection and advancement of the balloon catheter to the very proximal portion of the anomalous vessel to subsequently facilitate guide wire advancement.

A new technique was therefore prospectively evaluated for PTCA of these lesions using the ultra-low-profile Probe \"balloon on a wire\" device. An intracoronary Probing Catheter was used to facilitate crossing the stenosis with a guidewire and then to deliver a Probe into the obstruction for balloon dilatation. This technique was utilized in 64 consecutive patients with \"absolute\" coronary occlusions demonstrating no angiographically detectable antegrade coronary flow. Successful dilatation was achieved in 47 (73%). Among 33 occlusions of less than 3 mo duration 31 (94%) were successfully dilated whereas only 16 of 31 more chronic occlusions were dilated (P less than .01). Chronic occlusions with a tapered morphology and those located more than 1 cm from a branch point were more frequently dilatable. There were no serious complications including no vessel perforations with this technique. The Probing Catheter technique offers a safe and effective method for the dilatation of recent coronary occlusions by using balloon on a wire technology.\r"

  ".W": "We report on the complication rates in 660 consecutive coronary angioplasties (725 lesions) performed using four procedures that differed with respect to catheter technology and adjuvant medication. After the PTCA regimen in our laboratory had been changed from conventional steerable systems to the monorail technique, we observed a significant increase in the incidence of transient vessel occlusions from 2.6% to 7.7%, of permanent occlusions from 3.6% to 8.8%, and of intracoronary thrombus-formation from 2.6% to 5.5%. This was associated with the frequent observation of thrombotic material on the partially Teflon-coated guidewires. Coronary perfusion with urokinase (1,670-6,670 U/min) lead to a further increase in the complication rates (10.4%/10.3%/6.5%). Our present percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)-regimen (monorail technique with P.E.T. balloons, fully silicon-coated guidewires, no urokinase) shows an incidence of 3.8% for intermittent and recurrent coronary occlusions and 1.9% for permanent occlusions. Urokinase did not prevent intracoronary thrombus formation with the monorail technique. Furthermore, we suspect that in the case of PTCA-induced regional intimal dissection, fibrinolysis can prevent reestablishment of intima adherence to the vessel wall. Because five procedural deaths were observed in the 212 patients treated with i.c. urokinase as opposed to three deaths in the 448 procedures without urokinase, we feel that i.c. urokinase in PTCA is a potentially harmful regimen. We suggest that the monorail technique should be performed with fully silicon-coated guidewires and without urokinase.\r"

There were 10 males and 12 females aged 16-45 (average 25 +/- 9.9) years. All patients had additional mild to severe infundibular stenosis; 16 were restudied 6-36 (mean 12.6) months later by repeat catheterization. Student's t-test was used for comparison of data. Right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure before dilatation was 84-196 (mean 129 +/- 32.3) mm Hg, and the peak pulmonary gradient (PPG) was 60-176 (mean 111 +/- 33.2) mm Hg immediately after dilatation. The RV systolic pressure dropped to 32-140 (mean 59.2 +/- 27) (P less than 0.001); and PPG dropped to 10-113 (mean 37.8 +/- 26.4) (P less than 0.001), and the infundibular gradient ranged from 8 to 113 (mean 35.1 +/- 25.8) mm Hg. The infundibular diameter, before dilatation, ranged from 2 to 15 (mean 9.5 +/- 4) mm Hg. At repeat catheterization, the RV systolic pressure dropped further to 33-66 (mean 42.8 +/- 9.7) mm Hg and the PPG was reduced to 0-48 (mean 18.4 +/- 10.9) mm Hg (P less than 0.001). The infundibular gradient regressed to 0-34 (mean 15 +/- 8.8) mm Hg (P less than 0.001). The infundibular diameter increased to 8-25 (mean 15.8 +/- 5.4) (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that moderate to severe infundibular stenosis, in adults, can regress after successful pulmonary valvuloplasty.\r"

Successful PTCA was achieved in 98% of lesions with a 3.5% major procedural complication rate.

Most coronary stenoses will respond to pressures less than or equal to 8-10 atm.\r"

We measured the angiographic diameters of a broad range of diagnostic and angioplasty guiding catheters by using two commonly used edge-detection algorithms. Angiographic diameters are significantly less than true catheter outer diameter. Therefore the use of contrast-filled catheters as a dimensional reference may lead to considerable error in vessel measurement with overestimation of absolute dimension. Tables of reference values for multiple catheter as calibration standard, tested under a variety of angiographic conditions. The metallic-tipped marker was found to have a better degree of reproducibility than catheters. These findings have implications for studies employing serial measurements of coronary artery dimension and for the clinical practice of estimating vessel diameter for choice of balloon size during angioplasty.\r"

All PTS had claudication; 8 had rest pain; 3 had non-healing ulcers. The laser Probe was used in 17 cases and the Rotablator in 3 cases. Occlusion length varied between 1 and 40 cm: 7 lesions were less than 10 cm (group 1); 9 were between 10 and 20 cm (group 2); and 43 were greater than 20 cm (group 3). An angiographic success was obtained in 48/59 lesions (81%): 14/16 (87%) in groups 1 and 2 and 34/43 (79%) in group 3. Three PTS needed complementary common femoral endarterectomy and one required percutaneous aspiration of a thromboembolus. Complications included: arterial perforation and/or dissection (without clinical sequelae) in 11 and a popliteal hematoma in 1 PT. One patient with a severely ischemic leg underwent successful emergency vascular surgery, while another limb salvage patient required below-knee amputation. There was no worsening of limb ischemia from any popliteal approach attempt. At discharge, 39 patients (78%) whose outcome would have been unsuccessful with the traditional antegrade approach were clinically improved after utilizing the popliteal approach to achieve a successful angioplasty procedure.\r"

After endocardial mapping was used to identify the \"tachycardia-related\" coronary artery, temporary termination of the arrhythmia with balloon occlusion and subselective intracoronary installation of iced saline as previously advocated was unsuccessful. This was probably due to a dual arterial blood supply to the arrhythmogenic focus. However, infusion of 2 cc ethanol (99%) permanently terminated the arrhythmia. Contrary to previous experience, ethanol-induced arrhythmia termination did not result in arterial occlusion, further supporting a direct toxic effect on the myocardium as its mode of action. Use of standard angioplasty balloon inflation prevents \"backwash\" of distally infused ethanol and more generalized cell death. The only complication of this procedure was temporary third-degree AV block, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation.\r"

  ".W": "With modern digital cardiac systems the image data are digitized on-line and in real-time, allowing the replay and subsequent interpretation and analysis during or directly after the cardiac catheterization procedure. In this study we have evaluated the advantages and limitations of a manual tracing technique for left ventricular digital angiograms on the Phillips DCI system. Thirty-three patients who were catheterized for suspected coronary artery disease were studied. The manual tracings were performed by a senior cardiologist and an experienced function-analyst. It was found that the short- and long-term intraobserver variabilities in the assessment of the global ejection fraction were very small; short-term mean difference +/- standard deviation (correlation coefficient): 0.5 +/- 2.7 (r = 0.97) global EF%-units; long term; 0.7 +/- 2.7 (r = 0.96) EF%-units. The interobserver variabilities (5.1 +/- 4.8 (r = 0.93) EF%-units) were slightly higher than the intraobserver variabilities. A decrease by 25% in the amount of contrast medium administered did not significantly influence the variabilities in the contour tracings, which would suggest the use of smaller doses. At the average, the cardiologist and the function-analyst required 6 and 11 min of analysis time for a left ventricular study, respectively, emphasizing the need for further developments towards automated contour detection. Finally, an excellent correlation was found with a standard off-line cinefilm analysis procedure. Thus, it may be concluded that quantitative digital left ventricular angiography based on manual tracing of the outlines performed immediately following the cardiac catheterization (post-processing) is feasible as a routine procedure for the assessment of left ventricular function.\r"

One group received IV morphine in the recovery room and IM morphine on the ward on a PRN basis (PRN group). In the other group, a loading dose of morphine 8 mg IV was given when the patient first complained of pain and patient-controlled IV morphine (PCA) was initiated and continued for 48 h (PCA group). Both groups received similar amounts of morphine overall, differently distributed over time. The PCA patients received 8 mg.h-1 in the recovery room (approximately 2.5 hrs) and less thereafter. The PRN patients received approximately 2 mg.h-1 for the entire 48-hr period. Pain control was better throughout convalescence and less variable across time with PCA management. Minute ventilation also recovered faster and by day four was 25 per cent above the preoperative baseline in the PCA group. In addition, oral temperature became normal one day earlier, ambulation recovered more rapidly and patients were discharged from hospital earlier. The data suggest that early treatment with relatively high, self-titrated morphine doses may alter the course of the metabolic response to surgery.\r"

The addition of epinephrine did not significantly affect the quality or onset of sensory or motor block. The duration of sensory block was reduced by epinephrine at T1 for analgesia and at C7, C8, and T1 for anaesthesia. The duration of sensory block in the remaining brachial plexus dermatomes as well as the duration of motor block was not effected by epinephrine.

The objective of this randomized, patient (n = 30) and observer-blinded study was to compare prospectively the incidence and duration of post-anaesthetic neurological abnormalities in healthy patients undergoing minor elective procedures following thiopentone and succinylcholine induction, and enflurane-N2O or isoflurane-N2O anaesthesia. Patients were studied for 60 min after anaesthesia. Arousal state, muscle tone, deep tendon reflexes, plantar reflex, sustained clonus, shivering, intense muscular spasticity and temperature were assessed. Results of neurological examination were correlated with the patient's state of arousal. Transient emergent neurological abnormalities occurred more frequently following enflurane-N2O anaesthesia than isoflurane N2O anaesthesia. This was statistically significant (P less than 0.05) for quadriceps hyperreflexia, upgoing toes (positive Babinski reflex) and intense muscular spasticity. Neurological abnormalities occurred most commonly 5-20 min after anaesthesia and all abnormalities resolved within 60 min. Following enflurane anaesthesia, as patients became more alert the incidence of abnormalities declined, while the arousal state did not affect the incidence of abnormalities after isoflurane. There was no significant difference between axillary temperatures of those patients who shivered and those who did not. In conclusion, temporary emergent neurological abnormalities occurred more often following enflurane-N2O than after isoflurane-N2O anaesthesia.\r"

The average NMB was comparable between the groups at the time of reversal with neostigmine 50 micrograms.kg-1 (84 +/- 9 per cent, mean +/- SD) as were the NMB and the train-of-four ratio when the tracheas were extubated on a clinical basis (32 +/- 20 per cent and 50 +/- 18 per cent, respectively). Patients who had been paralyzed with atracurium arrived at the recovery room earlier and on arrival had greater train-of-four ratios than the patients paralyzed with alcuronium (P less than 0.01).

In order to stimulate events during rapid blood transfusion and cardiac arrest, the central circulation was modeled as a linear one compartment, and used to stimulate a child who suffered a hypovolaemic cardiac arrest and was resuscitated with rapid blood transfusion (RBT). The simulation suggested that the combination of RBT and a low cardiac output state could be associated with hyperkalaemia, if the potassium concentration in the plasma fraction of the transfused blood was greater than or equal to 10 mmol.L-1. In an associated clinical study the plasma potassium concentration during cardiac arrest was documented from a retrospective review of 138 cardiac arrests in a paediatric population. Patients were divided into two groups. The RBT-group received a rapid blood transfusion during resuscitation. The non-RBT group did not receive blood during resuscitation. During cardiac arrest the plasma [K] in the non-RBT group was 5.63 +/- 2.39 mmol.L-1 compared with 8.23 +/- 1.99 mmol.L-1 in the RBT-group (P less than 0.05). The hyperkalaemia during cardiac arrest in the RBT-group could be explained as a consequence of RBT to a hypovolaemic child with a low cardiac output.\r"

Patients were divided into four groups to receive a pre-induction bolus from a coded syringe, which contained either normal saline (PLAC), alfentanil 30 micrograms.kg-1 (ALF 30), alfentanil 45 micrograms.kg-1 (ALF 45) or alfentanil 60 micrograms.kg-1 (ALF 60). Anaesthesia was induced in rapid sequence with thiopentone 4.0 mg.kg-1 and succinylcholine 1.5 mg.kg-1, and the trachea was intubated 60 sec later. Increases in heart rate (21 +/- 10 bpm), mean arterial pressure (28 +/- 13 mmHg), and systemic vascular resistance index (1420 +/- 780 dynes.sec-1.cm-5) were observed in response to intubation with PLAC but in none of the 3 ALF groups (P less than 0.05). However, heart rate and mean arterial pressure decreased significantly in both the ALF 45 and ALF 60 groups (P less than 0.05), whereas ALF 30 resulted in no change in these variables over time.

  ".W": "Neuroprotective agents may exert their effect by reducing cerebral oxygen demand (CMRO2), increasing cerebral oxygen delivery, or by altering ongoing pathological processes. Barbiturates provide neuroprotection by reducing the CMRO2 necessary for synaptic transmission while leaving the component necessary for cellular metabolism intact. Isoflurane may exert a neuroprotective effect by a similar mechanism but its efficacy is likely less than that of barbiturates due to adverse effects on cerebral blood flow. Lidocaine reduces CMRO2 by affecting both cellular metabolic processes and synaptic transmission and thus resembles hypothermia in its mechanism of action. Benzodiazepines reduce CMRO2 by reducing synaptic transmission and their use as neuroprotectants produces less haemodynamic compromise than barbiturates. The mechanism of protection by calcium entry blocking agents appears to be due to improved blood flow as opposed to altering abnormal Ca++ fluxes. In contrast, agents such as ketamine and MK-801 may prevent abnormal Ca++ fluxes through their competitive interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Phenytoin prevents K(+)-mediated ischaemic events from progressing. Agents worthy of further investigation include corticosteroids, free radical scavengers, prostaglandin inhibitors and iron chelators.\r"

Repeat injections of 10 ml bupivacaine 0.25 per cent with 1/200,000 epinephrine provided analgesia within minutes and a duration of 8-10 hr. Injection of 10 ml radio-opaque dye demonstrated the catheter to be lateral to the scapular notch. However, dye dispersed throughout the supraspinous fossa including the scapular notch thus blocking the suprascapular nerve. This case demonstrates that continuous suprascapular nerve block can be performed for five days and that location of the scapular notch is less important than previously thought.\r"

Emphasis was placed on determining the incidence, magnitude and factors associated with epidural catheter migration as well as any relationship between catheter migration and the quality of analgesia. Catheter movement was assessed, prospectively, in 211 consecutive parturients who had an epidural catheter placed for labour analgesia. The magnitude and direction of catheter movement was assessed by measurement of the length of the catheter at the skin at the time of epidural placement, and immediately before removal of the catheter, after delivery. Fifty-four per cent of the catheters migrated during labour and 70 per cent of these migrated out of the epidural space. The quality of analgesia provided by the epidural block was assessed by the caseroom nurse caring for the patient. Seventeen per cent of the patients had unsatisfactory analgesia. There was an increase in poor analgesia in those patients whose catheters migrated compared with those in whom the catheters were stable (P less than 0.05). We conclude that catheter migration during labour results in a greater incidence of inadequate block and unsatisfactory analgesia.\r"

Serum bromide concentrations, using a gold chloride assay technique, were monitored at that time, and at four- and six-week intervals thereafter. Serum bromide concentrations demonstrated a four-fold change during this period ranging from peak levels of 2.2 mEq.L-1 (176 micrograms.kg-1) during the fifth week of treatment decreasing to less than 0.5 mEq.L-1 (less than 40 micrograms.ml-1) six weeks following the end of treatments.

Thoracic epidural lidocaine suppressed intracardiac conduction. Sinus cycle length (SCL) and Atrium-His (AH) interval increased by 9 and 11 per cent respectively (P less than 0.05), 30 min after TEL. Intravenous lidocaine did not increase either SCL or AH. The functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node increased five per cent above the control value 15 min after TEL (P less than 0.05), while it was unchanged in the IVL group. The mean plasma concentrations of lidocaine ranged from 0.48 +/- 0.07 to 1.00 +/- 0.14 micrograms.ml-1 in the TEL group and from 0.98 +/- 0.13) to 1.21 +/- 0.15 micrograms.ml-1 in the IVL group. There were no significant differences in plasma concentrations of lidocaine in both groups during the observation period. Therefore, it is concluded that the depressant effects of TEA on intracardiac conduction were caused by blocking of the sympathetic efferent activity. Caution may be advised in administering TEA when cardiac conduction is already compromised.\r"

At a concentration of 10(-7) M, bupivacaine did not modify isi. At 10(-6) M, the maximal amplitude of the slow-inward current (i max) was depressed by 11 per cent. At 10(-5) M, i max was depressed by 24.5 per cent, the time-to-peak current value (tpeak) was increased by 13.4 per cent and the inactivation time constant (tau in) by 29.8 per cent. At 10(-4) M, i max was depressed by 32.9 per cent, tpeak increased by 30.4 per cent and tau in by 58.7 per cent. In conclusion, bupivacaine produced only moderate inhibition of the slow-inward current. The findings might explain the decline in sinus impulse formation with sinus bradycardia, and the slowing of atrio-ventricular node conduction produced by bupivacaine. However, the decrease in contractility previously reported does not seem to be due only to inhibition of the slow-inward current.\r"

The theoretical results show that the response of an isolated cell to an increased frequency of stimulation is strongly altered by the presence of a coupling resistance to another cell. As the coupling resistance gradually is decreased, the stimulated cell becomes able to respond successfully to more rapid stimulation, and then, at levels of coupling resistance that allow conduction between the two cells, the coupled pair of cells exhibits arrhythmic interactions not predicted by the intrinsic properties of either cell. The experimental results show that the isolated rabbit ventricular cell is extremely sensitive to even a very small electrical load, with shortening of the action potential by 50% with electrical coupling to a model cell (of similar input resistance and capacitance to the ventricular cell) as high as 1,000 M omega, even though the action potential amplitude and current threshold are very insensitive to the electrical load.\r"

  ".W": "In rabbit papillary muscle contracting at 20 degrees C in nitrogen at 0.2 Hz, glycolytic ATP formation is just enough to support the diminished contractile activity. Basal metabolism, important to maintain cellular function and integrity, is strongly inhibited. In the present study, we address the question of whether the inhibition of basal processes in hypoxia determines redevelopment of force in reoxygenation. By not stimulating the muscle during hypoxia, we try to make more ATP available for basal processes. Isometric force of papillary muscles (0.2-Hz stimulation) is measured before, during, and after 40 minutes of hypoxia. ATP formation and utilization in hypoxia are estimated from lactate production and changes in nucleotides and creatine compounds. After reoxygenation, muscles stimulated during hypoxia produce a steady-state force of 78% of the aerobic control; resting muscles recover to 94%. In contrast to expectation, lactate production in hypoxic resting muscles is only 30% of that in contracting ones. The findings indicate that basal metabolic rate of hypoxic muscles at rest is 14% of that of quiescent, well-oxygenated myocardium. We conclude that in hypoxic myocardium little ATP is available for basal metabolism, irrespective of the energy demand of the contractile system. It is therefore unlikely that the lower force found after reoxygenation in muscles stimulated during hypoxia is related to the degree of inhibition of basal processes.\r"

  ".W": "Red blood cells and lysate products (erythrolysate) are observed consistently in lymph draining acute and chronic inflammatory reactions and from tissues subjected to trauma or surgical procedures. Using hemoglobin as a marker for erythrolysate, we have measured hemoglobin in lymph up to the 10(-6) M range in a number of pathophysiological states. Data demonstrate that erythrolysate alters the pumping characteristics of lymphatic vessels. To test the effects of erythrolysate on lymphatic pumping, bovine lymphatics were suspended in an organ bath preparation with the vessels cannulated at both inflow and outflow ends. By raising the heights of the Krebs reservoir and the outflow catheters appropriately, a transmural pressure that stimulated pumping activity could be applied to the vessels. With a fixed transmural pressure of 6 cm H2O applied to the ducts, sheep erythrolysate depressed pumping activity between 40% and 100%, with dilutions containing between 10(-8) and 10(-5) M hemoglobin. Although the active principle in the red blood cells has not been characterized, evidence from precipitation purification experiments suggests that hemoglobin is an important component. Once suppressed, pumping could be restored in many but not all vessels (often to control levels) by elevating the distending pressure above 6 cm H2O. The relation between transmural pressure and fluid pumping is expressed as a bell-shaped curve, with pumping increasing up to a peak pressure (usually 8 cm H2O) and declining at pressures above this level. By comparing pressure/flow curves, we were able to ascertain that hemoglobin shifted the lymphatic function curve to the right and, on average, reduced the maximum pumping capability of the vessels. We speculate that the presence of erythrolysate/hemoglobin in lymph may modulate the ability of lymphatic vessels to drain liquid and protein from the tissue spaces.\r"

To test this, we measured regional pericardial area over the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) with orthogonal pairs of sonomicrometers in six open-chest dogs. At a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 5 mm Hg, RV pericardial area paralleled RV volume, that is, shrinkage during ejection by 10 +/- 8% and expansion during filling. RA pericardial area was reciprocally related to RV pericardial area, with average expansion during ventricular ejection of 2 +/- 2%, thus paralleling RA volume during RV ejection. With volume loading, RV pericardial shrinkage during ejection increased to 14 +/- 6%, but the RA pericardial area change was no longer reciprocal (0 +/- 3% change during RV ejection). Elimination of contact forces by cardiac tamponade resulted in both marked attenuation of RV pericardial area changes and synchronization of the RV and RA pericardial area pattern; that is, both shrank during RV ejection. In two additional dogs, measurement of pericardial area over left ventricle and atrium showed similar results. We conclude that dynamic pericardial contact forces cause regional variation in pericardial deformation, which reflects volume changes of the underlying chambers. These findings imply that the influence of the pericardium on filling and ejection may be more complex than previously recognized, varying both by chamber and dynamically over the course of the cardiac cycle.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular events during the initiation and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation (VF) are poorly understood. We developed a nonischemic, isolated, perfused rabbit Langendorff preparation in which sustained VF could be induced by alternating current (AC) and which allowed changes in perfusate composition. We also used Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition (10 microM ouabain or K(+)-free perfusate) to induce VF. AC stimulation or Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition always initiated VF. Calcium channel blockade by verapamil or nitrendipine uniformly inhibited the initiation of VF in both models. During Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition, 1) VF was prevented by calcium channel blockade, despite evidence of Ca2+ overload, and 2) abolition of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum-generated cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations by ryanodine or Na+ channel blockade with tetrodotoxin did not prevent VF initiation. Lowering extracellular [Ca2+] to 80 microM uniformly prevented the initiation of VF due to Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition but not that due to AC stimulation. VF maintenance also was studied using 1) reduction in perfusate [Ca2+], 2) blockade of Ca2+ channels, or 3) electrical defibrillation. Decreasing the perfusate [Ca2+] to 80 microM resulted in defibrillation during VF whether induced by AC or Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition. Verapamil or nitrendipine also resulted in defibrillation regardless of the initiation method. Electrical defibrillation was successful only in AC-induced VF. The results demonstrate that VF can be initiated and maintained in a nonischemic rabbit Langendorff preparation. The data suggest that increases in slow channel Ca2+ flux, as opposed to increases in cytosolic Ca2+ per se, were necessary for the initiation and maintenance of VF. The data, however, do not exclude an important role for cytosolic Ca2+ in the modulation of VF.\r"

Pinacidil shortened the action potential duration, exhibiting stronger effect at 2 mM [ATP]i than at 5 mM [ATP]i. Pinacidil at 5 microM or higher concentrations activated the time-independent outward current at potentials positive to -80 mV, and the pinacidil-activated current was suppressed by increasing [ATP]i from 2 to 5 mM. The dose-response curve of pinacidil at different [ATP]i showed a shift to the right and a depression of the maximum response at increased [ATP]i. The pinacidil-induced shortening of the action potential duration and outward current were inhibited by application of 0.3-1.0 microM glibenclamide. In single-channel current recordings, pinacidil activated the intracellular ATP-sensitive K+ channel current without changing the unitary amplitude, and increased open probability of the channel, an effect dependent on [ATP]i. The pinacidil-activated single-channel current was blocked by glibenclamide. These results prove the notion that pinacidil activates the ATP-sensitive K+ channel current, which explains the action potential shortening in cardiac cells after application of pinacidil.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of adenosine-induced inhibition of Ca2+ currents was studied by recording single-channel Ca2+ currents from cell-attached patches on isolated guinea pig ventricular cells with pipettes containing 50 or 100 mM Ba2+. Numerous 100-msec depolarization steps were applied repetitively at 2 Hz from the resting potential of approximately -70 mV. The addition of 0.1 mM adenosine to the superfusate in the presence of 100 nM isoproterenol depressed the isoproterenol-induced increase in ensemble-averaged current: in peak amplitude, from 258 +/- 105% (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.01) that of control in the presence of isoproterenol to 153 +/- 41% (n = 7) (p less than 0.05) by the addition of adenosine. In these patches, adenosine did not much affect the open probability in nonblank sweeps (control, 0.10 +/- 0.05; isoproterenol, 0.11 +/- 0.08; adenosine and isoproterenol, 0.08 +/- 0.05), but significantly decreased channel availability, defined as the rate of current-containing sweeps in total sweeps (control, 0.36 +/- 0.17; isoproterenol, 0.69 +/- 0.16 [p less than 0.01]; adenosine and isoproterenol, 0.45 +/- 0.20 [p less than 0.01]). The decrease of channel availability by adenosine was due to the shortening of the duration of the available state and the prolongation of that of the unavailable state. The depressive action of adenosine was suppressed by 0.1 mM theophylline. The single-channel conductance in the presence of 100 mM Ba2+ and Bay K 8644 was 26 pS and was not affected by isoproterenol or adenosine. We conclude that adenosine decreases Ca2+ current under beta-adrenergic stimulation mainly by reducing channel availability.\r"

Coronary microvessels were directly observed by means of an intravital microscope and video system equipped with a floating objective. Epi-illuminated fluorescence coronary microangiography was performed in open-chest anesthetized dogs (n = 14) to examine the changes in internal diameter of epimyocardial arterial microvessels. Flow velocity of fluorescently labeled microshperes in capillaries was also measured (n = 6). To eliminate secondary effects of neuropeptide Y on coronary microvessels via autonomic nervous modulation, experiments were conducted under pharmacological blockade of the regional autonomic nervous system by intracoronary injection of propranolol, 50 micrograms/kg; phentolamine, 100 micrograms/kg; and atropine, 5 micrograms/kg. Aortic pressure and heart rate were kept constant during the experiments. Intracoronary infusion of three different doses of neuropeptide Y (1, 10, and 100 pmol/kg/min) for 5 minutes significantly constricted small microvessels (less than 100 microns in diameter) (-5.2 +/- 1.4%, -8.5 +/- 1.5%, and -14.0 +/- 1.7%; p less than 0.05 versus before neuropeptide Y at each dose), medium microvessels (100-200 microns in diameter) (-5.5 +/- 1.6%, -10.6 +/- 1.8%, and -16.8 +/- 2.1%, p less than 0.05 versus before neuropeptide Y at each dose), and large microvessels (greater than 200 microns in diameter) (-3.6 +/- 0.6%, -5.8 +/- 0.8%, and -10.0 +/- 1.1%; p less than 0.05 versus before neuropeptide Y at each dose) in a dose-dependent manner. Capillary flow velocity was reduced by 17.2 +/- 3.1% by an intracoronary dose of 100 pmol/kg/min of neuropeptide Y (p less than 0.05). The present study indicates that low doses of neuropeptide Y exert a homogeneous direct vasoconstrictor effect on various sizes of coronary arterial microvessels and reduce capillary flow velocity. These results suggest that neuropeptide Y may play a physiological role in modulating coronary microvascular tone.\r"

  ".U": "91029871\r", 
  ".W": "Vagal effects on atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction are accentuated by increases in heart rate. To establish the mechanism of these rate-dependent negative dromotropic actions, we studied the properties governing AV nodal adaptation to changes in heart rate in chloralose-anesthetized dogs in the absence and presence of bilateral cervical vagal nerve stimulation (20 Hz, 0.2 msec). Stimulation protocols were applied to evaluate the contributions of changes in AV nodal recovery, facilitation, and fatigue independently of each other. Vagal stimulation slowed AV nodal recovery in a voltage-dependent way, increasing the time constant of recovery (tau r) from 80 +/- 7 to 194 +/- 16 msec (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) at the highest voltage studied. The facilitating effect of a premature (A2) beat was manifested by a leftward shift of the recovery curve (A3H3 versus H2A3) of a subsequent A3 beat. The magnitude of shift depended on the A1A2 coupling interval and was reduced by vagal stimulation at all A1A2 intervals (maximum shift: control, 63 +/- 12 msec; vagus, 24 +/- 11 msec; p less than 0.01). When recovery and facilitation were kept constant, abrupt increases in AV nodal activation rate caused a slow (tau = 75 beats) increase in AH interval (fatigue). Vagal stimulation increased the magnitude of this process (maximum: control, 11 +/- 2 msec; vagus, 27 +/- 3 msec; p less than 0.001), without altering its time course. At activation rates comparable to sinus rhythm in humans, vagal stimulation at an intermediate voltage increased the AH interval by 25 msec. As heart rate increased, vagally induced changes in dynamic processes amplified AH prolongation up to fivefold at maximum rate. The role of vagal changes in individual functional properties depended on heart rate, but slowing of recovery was the single most important factor, constituting over 50% of overall vagal action at rapid rates. We conclude that vagal stimulation alters the ways in which the AV node responds to changes in activation rate and that at rapid rates most of the negative dromotropic action of the vagus is due to changes in the AV nodal response to tachycardia. Alterations in rate-dependent AV nodal properties are a novel and potentially important mechanism through which interventions may affect AV nodal conduction.\r"

  ".W": "To define the mechanism of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, the effects of doxorubicin and caffeine were examined on calcium release channels from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. We found that calcium release from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was induced by both compounds. When sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, calcium-permeable channels were observed. Addition of caffeine (2.5-10 mM) increased channel open probability from less than 0.1% to 40%, and this effect persisted for a mean of 44 minutes. In contrast, doxorubicin (2.5-10 microM) had a biphasic effect; initially, doxorubicin activated the channel, whereas after a mean of 8 minutes, the channel became irreversibly inhibited. Although the degree of channel activation by doxorubicin was concentration dependent, the time needed to inactivate the channel was concentration independent. Pretreatment with dithiothreitol (0.2 mM) prevented doxorubicin-induced channel inactivation, and channel activity persisted for an average of 58 minutes. Dithiothreitol alone did not alter channel open probability. Our results support the hypotheses that 1) the integrity of sulfhydryl groups is important for some aspects of calcium release channel function and 2) activation and inactivation of the channel are separable processes. The biphasic effect of doxorubicin on channel function may also correspond to the clinically observed adverse effects of doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent that, after prolonged usage, causes a dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".U": "91029874\r", 
  ".W": "The pathogenesis of the myopathy occurring in the heart of the cardiomyopathic strain of the Syrian hamster is not well understood but is believed to be associated with abnormal calcium handling by myopathic cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cardiomyopathy occurring in strain BIO 14.6 animals is associated with an enhanced alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated rise in cytosolic calcium, whether a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein is involved in coupling the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor to changes in intracellular calcium and whether enhanced alpha 1 responsiveness is associated with an increase in the level of expression of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor or in the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein or proteins. To test the hypothesis that the cardiomyopathic state is associated with a greater alpha 1-receptor-mediated rise in cytosolic calcium, we studied the effect of phenylephrine (in the presence of propranolol) on time-averaged cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in isolated cardiac myocytes from cardiomyopathic and age-matched control hamsters. Phenylephrine caused a greater increase both in time-averaged [Ca2+]i (an increase of 48 +/- 8% versus 12 +/- 3%, p less than 0.01) and in contractility (+181 +/- 22% versus +35 +/- 9%, p less than 0.01) in cardiomyopathic than in normal cardiac myocytes. Exposure to pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml for 3 hours) attenuated the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase in contractility and time-averaged [Ca2+]i in both cardiomyopathic and normal cells. The level of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, as determined by pertussis toxin-mediated [32P]ADP-ribosylation, was 1.6-fold higher in cardiomyopathic versus normal hamster hearts. The density of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, as measured by the antagonist radioligand [3H]prazosin and the affinity of the receptor for agonist and antagonist were similar in myopathic and normal heart membranes. Thus, in cardiac myocytes from hamsters, the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated effects on [Ca2+]i and contractility appear to be mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein or proteins. In myocytes from cardiomyopathic hamsters, these alpha 1-adrenergic effects were increased in magnitude, as was the level of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, but there was no measurable alteration in the density or ligand binding properties of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "To try to unravel the complexity and heterogeneity of the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms, we studied tissue perfusion in reperfused heart muscle by using tracer microspheres in an anesthetized dog model of 90-minute coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion for 2 1/2 hours, 24 hours, or 1 week. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined both in basal flow conditions and during reactive hyperemia. The effect of intracoronary adenosine administration was examined, and the ultrastructure of postischemic myocardium was analyzed. In viable reperfused tissue (as delineated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining), reflow in basal conditions is unimpaired. Coronary flow reserve (as approximated by peak reactive hyperemic flow) is intact at the start of reperfusion, decreases by more than half after 2 1/2 hours, and recovers completely within 1 week. This impairment of coronary reserve can be relieved by intracoronary adenosine administration. On ultrastructural examination, the capillaries are patent. On the other hand, in irreversibly damaged myocardium, both the basal reflow impairment and the decrease in coronary flow reserve are severe and permanent. Coronary flow reserve is already decreased at the start of reperfusion, and the pharmacological intervention has no beneficial effect. Ultrastructurally, extracellular and intracellular edema invariably are present, whereas the vascular endothelium is damaged and the capillaries are packed with red blood cells. We conclude that the no-reflow phenomenon (i.e., mechanical obstruction to blood flow) is limited to infarcted tissue. In viable myocardium, however, coronary flow reserve is transiently diminished, probably because of washout and subsequent insufficient availability of the chemical mediator adenosine after breakdown and slow recovery of the precursor ATP pool.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the pathophysiological role of readmission of oxygen (and hence production of oxygen-derived free radicals) in the initiation of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias by separating, on a temporal basis, readmission flow from readmission of oxygen. Isolated rat hearts (n = 12/group) were subjected to 10 minutes of regional ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion. In controls reperfused with oxygenated solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg), 92% of hearts developed ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the first 20 seconds of reperfusion, whereas in hearts reperfused with hypoxic solution (Po2 9.3-12.2 mm Hg), the incidence of VF was only 17% (p less than 0.05). Subsequent readmission of control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) to the latter group led, within 20 seconds, to the appearance of VF in seven of the 10 hearts (70%) that had not previously fibrillated. To examine whether hypoxic reperfusion had prevented VF or merely delayed its onset, the studies were repeated in separate groups of hearts with the duration of hypoxic reperfusion extended to 5 minutes. In addition, to examine the partial pressure dependence of the relation, the Po2 in the reperfusion solution was set at one of five different levels: greater than 600, 150-192.7, 69-85.6, 9.2-14.8, or 0.0 mm Hg. It was found that hypoxia merely delayed VF onset by 20-40 seconds and did not significantly reduce the incidence of VF, which was 83%, 92%, 67%, 58%, and 58%, respectively. This indicated that readmission of oxygen is unnecessary for the initiation of VF during reperfusion. The hearts that reverted to sinus rhythm during the ensuing 5 minutes (n = 8, 4, 5, 9, and 8, respectively) were used to assess the arrhythmogenic consequences of readmission of oxygen. When control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) was readmitted, new episodes of VF were elicited within 20 seconds in a manner that was inversely proportional to the preceding Po2 (p less than 0.05), the incidence of new episodes of VF being 0%, 0%, 40%, 67%, and 86%, respectively. The arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was not the result of a sudden increase in heart rate, because a similar arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was seen in separate groups of hearts that were paced (350 beats/min) throughout hypoxia and readmission of oxygen. In conclusion, readmission of flow and readmission of oxygen are independent determinants of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This series ventricular interaction is manifest as the temporal response in left ventricular filling (Qlvf) to a change in Qrvo. To quantify series interaction we used a three-element, two-parameter model of the pulmonary circulation. The parameters represented the pulmonary arterial and venous resistance and pulmonary vascular compliance. Using beat-to-beat values of mean pressure and flow measured at the input and output of the pulmonary circulation during the transient response to caval or pulmonary artery occlusion, we estimated the parameters for this model in eight open-chest dogs under control conditions, after autonomic blockade, and after fully opening the pericardium. From 110 separate data episodes, the average values of the pulmonary arterial and venous resistance and pulmonary vascular compliance were 0.14 +/- 0.08 mm Hg.sec/ml and 4.81 +/- 3.17 ml/mm Hg (+/- SD). These estimates were insensitive to the simultaneous effects of autonomic reflexes and direct ventricular interaction, so they uniquely measure the bulk transport properties of the pulmonary circulation. The time constant, which measures the response of Qlvf to a change in Qrvo, averaged 0.26 +/- 0.15 second, which implies that effects of series interaction on Qlvf are manifest within one beat. The model was also able to predict the dynamic response of Qlvf to changes in Qrvo and thus can be used to measure and predict the effects of series interaction in the intact cardiopulmonary system.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of temperature over the range 37-10 degrees C on the responses of isolated ferret ventricular trabeculae to the depletion and repletion of bathing calcium has been investigated. Cooling is found to reduce the rate of rise of intracellular sodium activity (measured with an ion-sensitive microelectrode) induced by depletion of bathing divalent cations, without affecting the prolonged depolarization. The rate of rise of [Na]i (with the sodium pump inhibited) shows a dependence on temperature (energy of activation, 67 kJ.mol-1; Q10, 2.3-2.8) that increases with increasing temperature. This contrasts with previously published data for the sodium pump for which the temperature dependence falls with increasing temperature. These results offer an explanation for the alleviation of the calcium paradox caused by cooling during the period of calcium depletion, which is similar to other procedures that offer protection by limiting the rise in [Na]i by having effects on the L-type calcium channel.\r"

  ".W": "Infusion of forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, in concentrations (2 microM) that do not alter basal prostaglandin (PG) synthesis inhibit synthesis of PG elicited by isoproterenol in rabbit heart. This inhibitory action of forskolin appears to be dependent on cyclic AMP (cAMP). Bolus injection of forskolin (75 nmol), however, was found to stimulate PG synthesis in rabbit heart. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of the stimulatory action of forskolin on PG synthesis (prostaglandin I2 measured as 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha [6-keto-PGF1 alpha]) in isolated perfused rabbit heart. Forskolin enhanced PG production in a dose-dependent manner. 1,9-Dideoxyforskolin, a forskolin analogue devoid of adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity, also enhanced PG synthesis. The cAMP analogue chlorophenylthio-cAMP failed to stimulate output of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, although this agent produced dose-related changes in mechanical function in rabbit heart. Furthermore, the adenylate cyclase inhibitor (-)-N6-(R-phenylisopropyl)adenosine potentiated, whereas the phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostamide attenuated, forskolin-stimulated PG production. (-)-N6-(R-Phenylisopropyl)adenosine and cilostamide had no effect on the mechanical actions of chlorophenylthio-cAMP, suggesting selectivity of these agents for adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase, respectively. 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha output elicited by forskolin was abolished by reduction of calcium in the perfusion fluid as well as by the calcium channel blocker diltiazem. The intracellular calcium antagonists TMB-8 and ryanodine also abolished forskolin-stimulated PG synthesis in rabbit heart. PG synthesis stimulated by 1,9-dideoxyforskolin was also prevented by reduced extracellular calcium, diltiazem, and ryanodine. The calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, W-7, and calmidazolium failed to significantly alter PG production in response to forskolin. These results indicate that forskolin-stimulated PG synthesis in rabbit heart is independent of cAMP and requires calcium from both extracellular and intracellular sources.\r"

First, the enzyme alanine aminotransferase was slowly infused into the left ventricular wall in open-chest dogs. The half-life for the washout of alanine aminotransferase activity into plasma was 20 +/- 4 minutes (mean +/- SEM, n = 8) and was not different in ischemic and normally perfused tissue. From measurements of arteriovenous differences in alanine aminotransferase activity and left ventricular blood flow, it was concluded that 77 +/- 14% of total enzyme washout from ischemic tissue occurred by direct entry into the bloodstream. The corresponding value for the vascular permeability-surface area product was 264 +/- 55 ml.kg-1.hr-1. For a second model, we studied myocardial enzyme release into plasma after abrupt heart injury induced by 10 minutes of calcium-free coronary perfusion followed by reintroduction of calcium (calcium-paradox mechanism). The half-life for the release into plasma was 1.9 +/- 0.2 hours (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) and was again not influenced by sustained ischemia. Slower washout, as observed for this second model, is consistent with increased interstitial protein space and corresponds to a permeability--surface area product between 135 and 285 ml.kg-1.hr-1. These results were used to calculate the time course of cellular enzyme leakage from the rate of enzyme release into plasma in various forms of heart injury. Significant shifts between the time curves of evolving cellular injury and enzyme release into plasma are observed after 2 hours of ischemia followed by coronary reperfusion, but not after permanent ischemia.\r"

The pressor response of DOI was blocked by pretreatment of the intermediate area with ketanserin, a serotonin2 antagonist (n = 7). Pretreatment with intravenous phentolamine did not block the pressor response of DOI (n = 3). However, this pressor response could be counteracted by intravenous propranolol (n = 5) or by bilateral stellate ganglionectomy (n = 3). These data suggest that sympathoexcitation by centrally applied DOI selectively increased cardiac inotropy but not chronotropy. Further studies indicate that DOI increased contractile force without increasing heart rate and that the positive inotropic effect of DOI could be counteracted by bilateral stellate ganglionectomy. Bilateral microinjections of DOI into the subretrofacial nucleus in a dose of 100 ng (n = 3) and a dose of 300 ng (n = 3) increased mean arterial blood pressure by 23 +/- 2 and 44 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively, without producing any changes in heart rate. These data suggest that DOI has a central site of action in the ventrolateral medulla, presumably at the subretrofacial nucleus, which leads to selective sympathoexcitation of the cardiac ventricles.\r"

Latent rPAI-1 (0-2 units of tissue-type plasminogen activator neutralizing activity per microgram protein); reactivated rPAI-1 (approximately 150 units/micrograms); and chloramine T-oxidized, nonreactivatable rPAI-1 (approximately 0.7 units/microgram) were studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters for the disposition of rPAI-1 antigen after an intravenous bolus injection of 1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg rPAI-1 were very similar for all three forms: the initial volume of distribution was approximately 60 ml/kg, the initial half-life in plasma was 6 minutes, and the plasma clearance was approximately 4 ml/kg/min. The disposition of PAI activity after injection of reactivated rPAI-1 was similar to that of rPAI-1 antigen. Injection of latent rPAI-1 was associated with a nearly threefold increase in the specific activity of circulating PAI-1 from 2 units/micrograms to 5.0 +/- 1.1 units/micrograms (p less than 0.01) within 1 minute, followed by a cumulative 25-fold increase in specific activity over 1 hour (p = 0.01). In contrast, the specific activity of oxidized or reactivated preparations of rPAI-1 did not increase in the first several minutes after injection. These findings support the existence of a fast-acting but low-capacity mechanism for the reactivation of rPAI-1 in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments were performed on enzymatically dissociated single ventricular myocytes harvested from feline endocardial and epicardial surfaces. The studies were designed to test the hypothesis that the differences in the amplitude of transient outward current (Ito) contribute to the difference in action potential configuration between endocardial and epicardial myocytes. In the control state, action potentials recorded from epicardial cells demonstrated a prominent notch between phases 1 and 2, and membrane current recordings displayed a prominent Ito, whereas in endocardial cells the notch in action potentials and Ito were small. External application of 4-aminopyridine (2 mM) reduced the amplitudes of notch and Ito in epicardial cells but not in endocardial cells. After application of 4-aminopyridine (2 mM) and caffeine (5 mM), the notch and Ito were abolished completely in both endocardial and epicardial cells. The first component of Ito (Ito1) was present in all epicardial cells studied (n = 20); it was absent in 12 of the 20 endocardial cells, and a small Ito1 was present in the remaining eight endocardial cells. The mean amplitude of Ito1 was significantly greater in epicardial than in endocardial cells. At a test voltage of +80 mV, the amplitude of Ito1 was 102.0 +/- 47.7 pA/pF in epicardial cells and 3.3 +/- 3.3 pA/pF in endocardial cells (p less than 0.01). The second component of Ito (Ito2) was present in all endocardial (n = 30) and epicardial (n = 30) cells studied. The amplitude of Ito2 was significantly greater in epicardial than in endocardial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cholinergic and beta-adrenergic stimulations of ionic currents are major physiological mechanisms in the regulation of heart rate and contractility. Muscarinic receptor stimulation is known to reduce beta-adrenergic effects on calcium current via reduction of cyclic AMP. Whether the beta-adrenergic stimulation affects the muscarinic response is not known. I report here that the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol enhanced the muscarinic-activated K+ channel activity in rat atrial cells. Application of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase or its catalytic subunit to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane augmented the acetylcholine-activated K+ channel activity twofold to threefold. Increases in channel activity produced by isoproterenol or cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase were associated with fourfold to fivefold and approximately twofold increases in the mean open and closed time durations, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase treatment reversed these effects. These results suggest that cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of the K+ channel or associated regulatory proteins modulates the gating kinetics of the channel. This mechanism may be important in the regulation of pacemaker activity and, thus, the heart rate during beta-adrenergic stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "For the past 5 years, investigators from many different laboratories have contributed to a greatly increased understanding of two very important lipid-carrying proteins in plasma--apo B-100 and apo B-48. Apo B-100, an extremely large protein composed of 4,536 amino acids, is synthesized by the liver and is crucial for the assembly of triglyceride-rich VLDL particles. Apo B-100 is virtually the only protein of LDL, a cholesteryl ester-enriched class of lipoproteins that are metabolic products of VLDL. The apo B-100 of LDL serves as a ligand for the LDL receptor-mediated uptake of LDL particles by the liver and extrahepatic tissues. The LDL receptor-binding region of apo B-100 is located in the carboxyterminal portion of the molecule, whereas its lipid-binding regions appear to be broadly dispersed throughout its length. Apo B-48 contains the amino-terminal 2,152 amino acids of apo B-100 and is produced by the intestine as a result of editing of a single nucleotide of the apo B mRNA, which changes the codon specifying apo B-100 amino acid 2,153 to a premature stop codon. Apo B-48 has an obligatory structural role in the formation of chylomicrons; therefore, its synthesis is essential for absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Both apo B-48 and apo B-100 are encoded on chromosome 2 by a single gene that contains 29 exons and 28 introns. An elevated level of apo B-100 in the plasma is a potent risk factor for developing premature atherosclerotic disease. In the past 3 years, many different apo B gene mutations that affect the concentrations of both apo B and cholesterol in the plasma have been characterized. A missense mutation in the codon for apo B-100 amino aid 3,500 is associated with hypercholesterolemia. This mutation results in poor binding of apo B-100 to the LDL receptor, thereby causing the cholesteryl ester-enriched LDL particles to accumulate in the plasma. This disorder is called familial defective apo B-100, and it is probably a cause of premature atherosclerotic disease. Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is a condition associated with abnormally low levels of apo B and cholesterol; affected individuals may actually have a reduced risk of atherosclerotic disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Its use in humans, however, has been hampered by lack of knowledge about its effects on the human coronary circulation and by concern about its safety. We investigated in humans the effects of adenosine, administered by intracoronary bolus (2-16 micrograms), intracoronary infusion (10-240 micrograms/min), or intravenous infusion (35-140 micrograms/kg/min) on coronary and systemic hemodynamics and the electrocardiogram. Coronary blood flow velocity (CBFV) was measured with a 3F coronary Doppler catheter. The maximal CBFV was determined with intracoronary papaverine (4.5 +/- 0.2.resting CBFV). In normal left coronary arteries (n = 20), 16-micrograms boluses of adenosine caused coronary hyperemia similar to that caused by papaverine (4.6 +/- 0.7.resting CBFV). In the right coronary artery (n = 5), 12-micrograms boluses caused maximal hyperemia (4.4 +/- 1.0.resting CBFV). Intracoronary boluses caused a small, brief decrease in arterial pressure (similar to that caused by papaverine) and no changes in heart rate or in the electrocardiogram. The duration of hyperemia was much shorter after adenosine than after papaverine administration. Intracoronary infusions of 80 micrograms/min or more into the left coronary artery (n = 6) also caused maximal hyperemia (4.4 +/- 0.1.resting CBFV), and doses up to 240 micrograms/min caused a minimal decrease in arterial pressure (-6 +/- 2 mm Hg) and no significant change in heart rate or in electrocardiographic variables. Intravenous infusions in normal patients (n = 25) at 140 micrograms/kg/min caused coronary vasodilation similar to that caused by papaverine in 84% of patients (4.4 +/- 0.9.resting CBFV). At submaximal infusion rates, however, CBFV often fluctuated widely. During the 140-micrograms/kg/min infusion, arterial pressure decreased 6 +/- 7 mm Hg, and heart rate increased 24 +/- 14 beats/min. One patient developed 1 cycle of 2:1 atrioventricular block, but otherwise, the electrocardiogram did not change. In eight patients with microvascular vasodilator dysfunction (delta CBFV, less than 3.5 peak/resting velocity after a maximally vasodilating dose of intracoronary papaverine), the dose-response characteristics to intracoronary boluses and intravenous infusions of adenosine were similar to those found in normal patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Basal HBF in men exceeded that of women (12.1 +/- 2.0 versus 6.2 +/- 1.5 ml/100 ml/min). Likewise, FBF in men surpassed that of women (19.5 +/- 4.1 versus 7.7 +/- 1.8 ml/100 ml/min). Similarly, SP in men was greater than that of women (270 +/- 42 versus 81 +/- 16 perfusion units). However, after total body warming (to induce a thermal sympatholysis), HBF in women exceeded that of men, suggesting that the lower basal HBF in women was due to increased sympathetic outflow to the extremities. Mental stress and deep inspiration reduced HBF and SP in men. Paradoxically, both of these maneuvers increased HBF and SP in women. To determine whether these paradoxical responses in women were due to the women's elevated basal sympathetic tone, these experiments were repeated after total body cooling in men to increase sympathetic tone and after total body warming in women to reduce sympathetic tone. Total body cooling reduced HBF and SP in men. Under these conditions, mental stress and deep inspiration induced vasodilation. In women, total body warming for 10 minutes increased HBF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 10 years, there was no difference in cumulative survival (medical, 79% vs. surgical, 82%; NS) and no difference in percentage free of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (medical, 69% vs. surgical, 66%; NS). Patients with an ejection fraction of less than 0.50 exhibited a better survival with initial surgery treatment (medical, 61% vs. surgical, 79%; p = 0.01). Conversely, patients with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 exhibited a higher proportion free of death and myocardial infarction with initial medical therapy (medical, 75% vs. surgical, 68%; p = 0.04) although long-term survival remained unaffected (medical, 84% vs. surgical, 83%; p = 0.75). There were no significant differences either in survival and freedom from nonfatal myocardial infarction, whether stratified on presence of heart failure, age, hypertension, or number of vessels diseased. Thus, 10-year follow-up results confirm earlier reports from CASS that patients with left ventricular dysfunction exhibit long-term benefit from an initial strategy of surgical treatment. Patients with mild stable angina and normal left ventricular function randomized to initial medical treatment (with an option for later surgery if symptoms progress) have survival equivalent to those patients randomized to initial surgery.\r"

Throughout follow-up, recreational status, employment status, frequency of heart failure, use of other medications, and hospitalization frequency were similar between the two groups. Thus, indexes of quality of life such as angina relief, increased activity, and reduction in use of antianginal medications initially appear superior in patients with stable manifestations of ischemic heart disease assigned to surgery, but by 10 years after entry, these advantages are much less apparent. Although the observed similarities of the medically and surgically assigned groups at 10 years reflect return of symptoms in the surgical group to some extent, a more important explanation is the performance of late surgery in a large proportion of the medically assigned patients, rendering them asymptomatic.\r"
