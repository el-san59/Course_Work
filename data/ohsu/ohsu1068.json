Blacks show DR-DQ relationships that are different from other races and are a useful group in which to investigate HLA-D region associations with IDDM. In this study, the frequencies of HLA-DQA1 and -DQB1 alleles in Afro-Caribbean IDDM and control subjects were compared. Alleles were identified with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing. The DQA1 allele A3 was positively associated with IDDM (relative risk [RR] = 25.3, corrected P [Pc] less than 7.0 x 10(-6). The DQB1 alleles DQw2 and DQw8 were also positively associated (RR = 4.7, Pc less than 6.5 x 10(-3) and RR = 12.3, Pc = 3.4 x 10(-3), respectively). The A1.2 and DQw6 alleles were negatively associated (RR = 0.16, Pc less than 3.5 x 10(-3) and RR = 0.15, Pc = 2.4 x 10(-2), respectively). These findings were compared to data from other races. The positive associations with A3 and DQw2 are consistent with all racial groups investigated. The negative association with DQw6 is present in all racial groups in which it is a common allele. These findings suggest that DQ alleles, and hence DQ molecules, may directly affect predisposition to IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Due to concerns of cross-reactivity between renal and islet allografts in initiation of rejection, we determined the ability of donor-specific and third-party splenic dendritic cells (DCs) and thyroids (whole-organ transplant) to initiate rejection of established islet allografts. Purified islets from neonatal F-344 (RT1Lv1) rats were transplanted bilaterally under the kidney capsule of Wistar-Furth (W/F, RT1u) rats without immunosuppression. The islet allografts were not rejected by 21 days posttransplantation. On day 22, freshly isolated or cultured DCs were injected intraperitoneally into the host. Both freshly isolated and cultured donor-specific (F-344) and some third-party (Buffalo, RT1b; ACI, RT1a) DCs initiated rejection of the islets as indicated by lymphocyte infiltration and destruction of the allograft. DCs, whether freshly isolated or cultured for 8 days from the recipient strain (W/F) and one third-party rat (Brown Norway, RT1n), did not initiate rejection. Splenic DCs from the Lewis (RT1l) rat, which has the same class I and II antigen haplotype as F-344 islet donor rats, also initiated rejection. Only 10(3)-10(4) DCs isolated from the spleen of donor rats were required to initiate rejection of the allograft. In a parallel series of W/F rats with islet allografts, a thyroid (half lobe) from the islet donor strain (F-344), recipient strain (W/F), or third-party rat (Buffalo, Brown Norway, or ACI) was inserted under the kidney capsule at 22 days post-islet transplantation. At 35 days, all thyroids and most islet allografts exhibited active or complete rejection after thyroid transplant from Buffalo, F-344, or ACI rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) susceptibility is associated with the DR4-DQw4 haplotype in Japanese and the DR4-DQw8/-Drw8-DQw4 genotype (among others) in whites. We investigated whether these Japanese and white individuals encode the same or a similar DQ alpha beta heterodimer, which may be an IDDM-susceptibility molecule in both populations. First, we carried out genomic DQA1 and DQB1 typing with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The results revealed that Japanese DR4-DQw4 and white DR4-DQw8/DRw8-DQw4 IDDM patients carried the DQA1*0301 allele and the DQB1*0401 or DQB1*0402 allele, either in the cis (Japanese DR4-DQw4 individuals) or trans (white DR4-DQw8/DRw8-DQw4 individuals) position. Because the DQB1*0401 and DQB1*0402 alleles differ only at residue 23, these DQB1 genes are very similar. We next tested cells from these individuals with a particular DQ-specific T-lymphocyte clone, HH58. The clone was only restimulated with cells from Japanese individuals who carried the DQA1*0301 and DQB1*0401 alleles in the cis position or white individuals who carried the DQA1*0301 and DQB1*0402 alleles in the trans position. Thus, particular cis- or trans-encoded DQ alpha beta heterodimers, which in both cases are recognized by T lymphocytes, may confer susceptibility to IDDM in both ethnic groups.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis of genetic defects in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) regulation among patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and nephropathy was assessed by studies in tissue cultures of fibroblasts obtained from 7 patients with normal urinary albumin excretion, 11 patients with diabetic nephropathy, and 6 nondiabetic control subjects. The incorporation of [2H] glucosamine and [35S] sulfate into hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (CS + DS), and heparan sulfate (HS) was measured in cells, matrix, and medium and related to micrograms of tissue protein. Large interindividual variations were seen in all three groups, and the incorporation of [3H] glucosamine into HA, CS + DS, and HS and [35S] sulfate into CS + DS and HS were not significantly different between the three groups. However, the fractional incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into HS was significantly reduced in diabetic patients with nephropathy compared with control subjects. This was the case not only when related to the total amount of GAGs (P = 0.014) but also when related to HA (P = 0.014). No significant difference was seen between control subjects and normoalbuminuric diabetic patients. The degree of N-sulfation of HS was not significantly different between the experimental groups. The results suggest that patients with diabetic nephropathy may suffer from deficiencies of coordinate regulation in the biosynthesis of GAG in fibroblasts, which may lead to a reduced density of HS in the extracellular matrix. If these changes reflect alterations in the biosynthesis of GAG from endothelial, myomedial, and mesangial cells, this observation may be relevant for the pathogenesis of severe diabetic complications.\r"

Three different in vitro models with attenuated insulin response were used: rat islets cultured at a low glucose concentration, rat islets incubated in vitro with streptozocin, and fetal rat islets. The fetal and streptozocin-administered islets were compared with adult islets cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 11 mM glucose, and the effects of the in vitro glucose concentrations (3.3, 11, and 28 mM) were assessed on adult islets only. Cellular mRNA levels for the mitochondrial DNA-encoded cytochrome b and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were determined by Northern-blot analysis. Enzymatic activities of high-Km (glucokinase) and low-Km (hexokinase) glucose-phosphorylating enzymes and succinate-cytochrome c reductase were also determined. Islets cultured at 3.3 mM glucose displayed a decreased activity of glucokinase compared with islets cultured at 28 mM glucose (23.3 +/- 12%), whereas there was no difference in hexokinase activity or the level of GAPDH mRNA. The activity of succinate-cytochrome c reductase was similar in islets cultured at the different glucose concentrations. The level of cytochrome b mRNA increased at 28 mM glucose compared with islets cultured at 11 mM glucose (140 +/- 14%). Islets incubated with streptozocin and subsequently cultured for 7 days at 11 mM glucose exhibited a decreased level of cytochrome b mRNA (65 +/- 5%) and no differences in the activities of glucokinase, hexokinase, succinate-cytochrome c reductase, or the level of GAPDH mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We used the recently described technique of single-stranded conformation-polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to examine the insulin-receptor locus. First, the ability of the method to detect known mutations and polymorphisms in the insulin-receptor coding sequence was assessed. Regions of the insulin-receptor sequence containing 16 different nucleotide changes, 9 in patient genomic DNA and 7 as cloned cDNA in plasmids, were analyzed. All 9 patient genomic DNA mutants and 5 of 7 plasmid mutants exhibited variant SSCP patterns. To investigate the potential of the technique for screening many patients, the 5 exons that encode the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor were examined in 30 unrelated white subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Exons 17-21 were amplified from genomic DNA with polymerase chain reaction and subjected to SSCP analysis. Exons 19, 20, and 21 revealed no bands of aberrant migration, suggesting a high degree of conservation of these sequences. One diabetic subject had an SSCP variant in exon 18. Direct sequencing of this subject's genomic DNA revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (Lys1068----Glu1068). Five different SSCP patterns were detected in exon 17. Based on direct sequencing, these patterns were explained by combinations of three different nucleotide substitutions, two of which were common silent polymorphisms. One subject had a heterozygous missense mutation Val985---- Met985. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed the presence of these mutations in the appropriate diabetic subjects and also detected the Val985 mutation in heterozygous form in 1 of 13 nondiabetic white subjects. SSCP analysis is a sensitive rapid method for screening for mutations in the insulin-receptor gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To elucidate the mechanism, male rats were treated for 3 days with saline (control) or etomoxir (ethyl 2-[6-(p-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]-glycidate), a prodrug, which in vivo is converted to a specific competitive inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, and thus, lipid oxidation. Oleic acid (0.4 mM) reduced both 125-I-labeled insulin binding and insulin-stimulated [14C]aminoisobutyric acid transport approximately 40% in cells from control animals. However, this FFA concentration was without effect in cells from etomoxir-treated animals. Etomoxir increased EC50 for the inhibitory effect of oleic acid on insulin binding approximately threefold. The data indicate that the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids may be important for their inhibitory effect on insulin binding and action in isolated rat hepatocytes.\r"

Apo(a) levels were increased in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (geometric mean 245 U/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 142-427, n = 30) and albuminuria (mean 196 U/L, 95% CI 97-397, n = 18) with levels comparable to patients with coronary artery disease (mean 193 U/L, 95% CI 126-298, n = 40), which were higher than in the control group (mean 107 U/L, 95% CI 85-134, n = 140; P = 0.016). Apo(a) levels in diabetic patients without microalbuminuria (mean 86 U/L, 95% CI 63-116, n = 59) were comparable with the control population and less than in those with microalbuminuria (P less than 0.001) and albuminuria (P = 0.014).

We describe the use of this test in biopsy specimens from the gastric antrum from 220 consecutive patients referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The performance of the 'one minute test' was compared with a standard urease test, Gram stain, and microbiological culture. Using culture as the 'gold standard' 80 (36%) of the patients were H pylori positive. The one minute test produced no false positives and showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100%, while the predictive values of a positive and negative test were 100% and 94% respectively. The diagnostic efficiency of the test was 96% compared to 85% for both the Gram stain and direct urease test. All positive results using the one minute test were available within one minute. The test is easy to prepare and costs approximately pounds 0.04. This new modification of the urease test should be superior to the currently available urease tests because a reliable result will be available in almost 90% of infected individuals even before endoscopy is completed.\r"

  ".W": "Some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have delayed gastric emptying. This study investigates the effect of cisapride on gastric emptying in 34 patients with proved reflux and delayed gastric emptying of solids. They were enrolled in a double blind controlled crossover study. Placebo or cisapride (10 mg) tablets were given three times a day for three days followed by further assessment of gastric emptying. The protocol was repeated with the crossover tablet. Gastric emptying was assessed by a dual radionuclide technique. The percentage of a solid meal remaining in the stomach at 100 minutes (% R100 minutes) and the time taken for 50% of the liquid to empty (T50 minutes) were calculated and analysed by the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test and expressed as medians (ranges). For gastric emptying of solids the initial % R100 minutes (70 (60-100)%) was not significantly different from placebo (71 (35-100)%). After cisapride treatment a significant acceleration (p less than 0.001) in gastric emptying occurred (% R100 minutes, 50.5 (28-93)%). Similarly with gastric emptying of liquids, the initial T50 minute value was 26.5 (12-82) minutes, after placebo the value was 28 (11-81) minutes, but this was significantly accelerated with cisapride (p less than 0.03) to 22.5 (6-61) minutes. The acceleration in gastric emptying occurred in the proximal portion of the stomach for gastric emptying of both solids and liquids suggesting that this is the principal site of action of cisapride. We conclude that cisapride significantly accelerates gastric emptying of both solids and liquids in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and delayed gastric emptying.\r"

Fasting gastroduodenal motility was measured during euglycaemia (blood glucose concentration 3-5 mmol/l) and during hyperglycaemia induced by intravenous dextrose (blood glucose concentration 12-16 mmol/l). Antral, pyloric, and proximal duodenal pressures were recorded by a sleeve/sidehole manometric assembly positioned across the pylorus, with the aid of measurements of transmucosal potential difference. During hyperglycaemia there was stimulation of isolated pyloric pressure waves when compared with the euglycaemia period (p less than 0.05). This was associated with inhibition of antral pressure waves (p less than 0.05). In nine of the 11 subjects an episode of duodenal 'phase III like' activity occurred within 15 minutes of the onset of hyperglycaemia. It is proposed that the stimulation of localised pyloric contractions and inhibition of antral contractions contribute to the delayed gastric emptying induced by hyperglycaemia. Abnormal gastric motility in patients with diabetes mellitus may be the result of hyperglycaemia itself, rather than irreversible autonomic neuropathy.\r"

Endoscopic ultrasound provided excellent results compared with computed tomography and conventional ultrasound, particularly in evaluating perigastric lymph node metastasis and direct infiltration to the adjacent organs. The success rate in detecting lymph node metastasis was 50% (11 of 22 patients); the accuracy in diagnosing direct infiltration to the adjacent organs was 60% (three of five patients). This technique is useful in diagnosing malignant invasion and lymph node metastasis of gastric carcinomas but requires further refinement for use in diagnosing the disease itself. Its preoperative use is recommended for establishing surgical and other treatment plans, as well as in predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer.\r"

The half time for gastric emptying (t1/2) and the mouth to caecum transit time of a high fat test meal was significantly faster after the high fat diet than the low fat diet when consumed for 14 days (t1/2=98 (80-116) v 147 (88-206) minutes (median (range)), p less than 0.05; mouth to caecum transit time 240 (130-350) v 360 (200-520) minutes, p less than 0.05), but not when consumed for only four days.

When subjects were given an appetising meal to consume on the day that they had consumed the transit test meal, they ate similar amounts irrespective of their recent dietary history, though the eating rate was significantly slower after the high fat diet (mean (SEM)) 46.7 (1.9) v 71.3 (14.8)/min, p less than 0.05). Maintaining normal subjects on a high or low fat diet for two weeks resulted in a desensitisation or sensitisation respectively of the mechanisms by which nutrients regulate gastrointestinal transit. These findings emphasise the importance of the recent dietary history in the interpretation of gastric emptying and small bowel transit time data.\r"

Significant secondary associations occurred with HLA-DR3 (91% of patients versus 28% of control subjects) and DPw1 (39% of patients versus 11% of control subjects). Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease thus share an identical HLA class II association. It is likely that HLA class II genes directly influence the immune responses leading to mucosal damage in both diseases. The strongest candidate for disease susceptibility to dermatitis herpetiformis is DQw2. The HLA molecule most likely to be involved in coeliac disease is a specific DQ alpha/DQ beta heterodimer, encoded in cis arrangement in DR3 haplotypes or in trans arrangement in a DR5, 7 genotype. Our data on dermatitis herpetiformis patients fits this model perfectly. All these patients are capable of expressing this molecule, which may be responsible for the gluten sensitive enteropathy seen in a subgroup of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease.\r"

Recurrence rates, defined by recurrent intestinal symptoms and radiological confirmation of mucosal disease, were calculated using survival analysis. Age, sex, anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, preoperative duration of symptomatic disease, use of preoperative bowel rest, and pathological features of the resected bowel were analysed individually and jointly as potential risk factors influencing postoperative recurrence of disease. Eighty two patients (age, mean (SD) 14.8 (2.5) years) underwent intestinal resection and were followed postoperatively for a minimum of one year (mean 5.3 (3.3) years). Anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, and preoperative duration of symptomatic disease were the only factors that significantly influenced the duration of the recurrence free interval. Patients with diffuse ileocolonic inflammation experienced earlier recurrence (50% at one year) than children with predominantly small bowel disease (50% recurrence at five years, p less than 0.0001). Failure of medical therapy independent of disease location as the sole indication for surgery was associated with an earlier relapse than when surgery was performed for a specific intestinal complication such as abscess or obstruction (p less than 0.003). Patients undergoing resection within one year of onset of symptoms experienced delayed recrudescence of active disease (30% recurrence by eight years) compared with patients whose preoperative duration of symptomatic disease was longer (50% recurrence by four years when preoperative duration of disease was one to four years and 50% by three years when disease had been present greater than four years preoperatively, p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A structural analysis of faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin was carried out using immunoblot analysis under non-reducing conditions. Native serum alpha 1 antitrypsin migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa. Proteolytic alpha 1 antitrypsin fragments (5-42 kDa) were specifically immunostained in 13/19 and 22/34 stool samples from control subjects and from patients with Crohn's disease respectively. There was a weak correlation (r = 0.47; p less than 0.02) between the molecular weight of fragmented alpha 1 antitrypsin and the faecal concentration in both groups, indicating that alpha 1 antitrypsin inhibits its own proteolysis by intestinal proteases in a dose dependent way. The incidence of polymeric forms (greater than 45 kDa) was similar in patients (10/34) and control subjects (5/19). In only one case in each group was the native serum form of alpha 1 antitrypsin found in faeces. We conclude that faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin differs structurally from the native serum form. Immunochemical measurements, therefore, reflect rather than represent faecal concentrations of alpha 1 antitrypsin. The controversial results in published reports may be partly explained by these findings. The molecular heterogeneity of faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin is not specifically associated with Crohn's disease.\r"

Active bile acid transport was quantified in vitro using brush border membrane vesicles prepared from terminal ileal biopsy specimens from 10 patients who fulfilled the criteria of idiopathic bile acid diarrhoea. They were recruited from 181 patients with bile acid malabsorption of various causes. Transport was quantified as in vitro Na+ dependent bile acid transport (INBAT), expressed as pmol taurocholate/mg brush border membrane protein/15 seconds, and in vitro Na+ dependent bile acid local transport capacity (INBALTC), expressed as pmol taurocholate/g ileal biopsy tissue/15 seconds. The lowest INBAT and INBALTC values in the 10 patients with idiopathic bile acid diarrhoea were well above the 10th centile values of a control group of 132 patients. Both INBAT (mean (range) 88 (30-136)) and INBALTC (158 (85-268)) values were significantly higher in the 10 patients than in the control group (INBAT: mean (range) 63 (1-244), INBALTC: mean (range) 98 (1-408)). Quantification of active ileal bile acid transport in these 10 patients with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption suggests that a genetic (carrier) defect is rare in adults.\r"

In this study the presence of the Mr 40,000 protein was assessed in experimental animals by the direct and inhibition enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using the anti-Mr 40,000 protein monoclonal antibody, 7E12H12 (IgM isotype). In addition, a total of 129 specimens including colon, small intestine, gall bladder, biliary tract, and kidney from nine strains of rats and mice, and from human tissue were studied by the immunocytochemical method using 7E12H12. All colon specimens from both humans and animals reacted with 7E12H12 in the immunocytochemical and ELISA assays. None of the non-colonic organs reacted with 7E12H12. While in human colon 7E12H12 recognised the absorptive epithelial cells, in all the animals it recognised mainly the colonic goblet cells. Extracts of animal colon but not of small intestine inhibited the binding of 7E12H12 to the human colon extract. This study shows the presence of an organ specific Mr 40,000 colonic epithelial protein(s) in humans and experimental animals. A differing cellular localisation of the Mr 40,000 protein(s) in human v animal tissue was also shown. Further characterisation of the Mr 40,000 protein(s) may provide important clues regarding the autoimmune mechanisms in ulcerative colitis.\r"

Family interviews were possible for 95% (n = 205) of all non-polyposis probands and verification of vital status or medical history was obtained for 98% of 1811 first degree relatives. The prevalence of cancer family syndrome was between 1 and 2%, a figure some fivefold less than that estimated elsewhere. A proximal tumour excess was not characteristic of the ascertained families. These results may have implications for the identification of susceptible people if screening for high risk groups is considered a worthwhile option for reducing colorectal cancer mortality in the United Kingdom.\r"

The family history was validated in 95% of all nonpolyposis cases (n = 205). Medical history or cause of death were verified for 98% of 1811 first degree relatives. The strength of the family history was assessed using a score that compares the mortality from bowel cancer in the family against the average population mortality, taking account of family size and age structure. The family history score was not predictive of survival neither in univariate analysis or in a Cox's proportional hazards multivariate analysis controlling for age, sex, stage, site, and duration of symptoms. In conclusion, a positive family history does not independently influence prognosis in patients with bowel cancer.\r"

  ".U": "91250152\r", 
  ".W": "Photodynamic therapy is a photochemical technique for the local destruction of tumours, entailing the interaction of light with an administered photosensitiser to produce a cytotoxic effect. We investigated the tissue distribution of the photosensitiser aluminium sulphonated phthalocyanine (AlSPc) in dimethylhydrazine induced colonic tumours and adjacent normal colon in rats. Forty eight hours after intravenous injection, most tumours contained twice as much AlSPc as normal colon. Tumour size and position in the colon did not affect AlSPc concentration. Microscopic fluorescence localisation of AlSPc showed significant photosensitiser accumulation in tumour stroma, whereas tumour and normal mucosa contained similar amounts. Thus, some normal tissue damage, where malignant cells invade normal areas, would inevitably accompany eradication of tumours. Tumour destruction and healing of colon after tumour eradication were examined histologically. There was sharp demarcation between necrotic areas (tumour or normal) and adjacent tissue and, whether the treated area was tumour or normal, healing occurred by regeneration of normal tissue. Some incompletely eradicated large tumours showed evidence of delayed bleeding. The possibility of selective uptake or preferential retention of the photosensitiser in tumours formed the initial basis for investigation of photodynamic therapy, but it is now clear that this is seldom the most important factor for tumour eradication. Of far greater importance is the nature of the biological effect of photodynamic therapy as necrosis of small tumours involving the full thickness of the bowel wall can be achieved with safe healing by regeneration of normal colon. The maximum depth of necrosis produced was only a few millimetres, so this technique is unlikely to be of value as the primary treatment for large colonic tumours but may prove of value for eradicating small lesions or as adjunctive therapy for eradication of small nests of tumour remaining or recurring in the tumour bed after conventional surgery.\r"

Fourteen patients (64%) were symptomatic on presentation. Twelve of the 14 adult women had taken the oral contraceptive pill. Twelve patients, nine of whom were symptomatic, underwent hepatic resection shortly after presentation. There were no deaths or major complications, and all remain well on follow up. Four patients underwent either hepatic artery embolisation or ligation. After an interval of six to 10 years they were asymptomatic and only one has histological evidence of residual focal nodular hyperplasia. Of five patients initially treated conservatively, two were asymptomatic and have remained so for three and 13 years. One of the three symptomatic patients became symptom free after stopping the contraceptive pill. The management of focal nodular hyperplasia requires a flexible approach. Lesions which are asymptomatic can be observed with regular ultrasound and treated if they enlarge or become symptomatic. Symptomatic patients who present while taking the contraceptive pill can also have a trial of conservative treatment. Other symptomatic patients, including those who previously took the pill, are best treated by surgical resection, and, where this is not possible, by embolisation.\r"

Time/course studies after subcutaneous injection of CV 3611 in normal mice showed a peak plasma concentration of mean (SEM) 0.54 (0.09) micrograms/ml at one hour, with a gradual decrease over the next 10 hours, while a peak concentration in pancreatic tissue of mean (SEM) 425 (33) ng/g tissue was achieved at three hours and the drug was undetectable at 12 hours. Survival rates and activities of pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase, elastase I) were compared in control mice and animals that received CV 3611 before or at the time of feeding the CDE diet. The survival rate was observed in a no treatment group and mice given pretreatment or treatment with CV 3611 or superoxide dismutase. The survival rate was significantly better in the treatment group given CV 3611 (p less than 0.02), but superoxide dismutase had no significant effect on survival. The increases in the three serum enzyme activities were significantly less at 48 hours in the groups given pretreatment or treatment with CV 3611 than in the no treatment group. These results indicate that CV 3611, which has been proved to pass through the cell membrane and to have a long half life in plasma and tissue, had an important therapeutic effect on the development of acute pancreatitis. They also suggest that oxygen derived free radicals may play an important role in the development of acute pancreatitis.\r"

In order to determine whether similar changes can be seen in animal models of pancreatic cancer a molecular analysis of tumours induced in rats by pancreaticobiliary diversion was performed. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify portions of the rat Kirsten ras gene and sequence specific oligonucleotide hybridisation was used to define whether sequences were wild type or mutant. No evidence of mutation was found in the Kirsten ras gene at codons 12 or 61, where activating mutations are known to occur. In addition immunohistochemical methods were used to investigate expression of c-erB-2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor but no evidence of abnormal expression was found. We conclude that there are major molecular differences between human and experimental rat pancreatic cancer.\r"

TSP is involved in a number of cellular processes which govern tumor cell behavior including mitogenesis, attachment, migration, and differentiation. To directly assess the role of TSP in tumor cell growth and spread, a human squamous carcinoma cell line, with high TSP production and an invasive phenotype, was transfected with a TSP cDNA antisense expression vector. Five unique transfected clones were obtained with reduced TSP production. Expression of the transfected antisense sequence in these clones was verified by a ribonuclease protection assay. These clones demonstrated reduced growth rates in vitro when compared with a vector transfected control. After subcutaneous inoculation into athymic mice, the antisense clones formed either no tumors or tumors that were slow growing and highly differentiated. This contrasted with the vector-transfected clone which produced poorly differentiated, rapidly growing, invasive tumors. Our results argue in favor of a direct role for TSP in determining the malignant phenotype of certain human tumors.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3) on the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells. Receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3 were demonstrated in fresh rabbit aortic tissue and in cultured rat VSM using binding of [3H]-1,25-(OH)2D3 in sucrose density gradients of the tissue or cell homogenates. The receptor sedimented at 3.6 S, the sedimentation velocity of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors from other sources. 1,25-(OH)2D3 dramatically altered the growth of VSM, but this effect depended importantly on the basal conditions in which the cells were grown. In quiescent VSM deprived of serum for 72 h, 1,25-(OH)2D3 (0.1-10 nM), but not 25-(OH)D3 (up to 100 nM) increased thymidine incorporation up to 12-fold and cell number up to 2.6-fold compared with controls. The maximal effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on thymidine incorporation was similar to the maximal effect of the growth factors alpha-thrombin or PDGF. Furthermore, the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and thrombin on thymidine incorporation in quiescent cells were markedly synergistic, yielding a 78-fold increase in thymidine incorporation when both agents were added simultaneously. In \"nonquiescent cells\" which were exposed to serum-free medium for only 24 h, 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nM) also increased DNA synthesis 10-fold compared with controls. However, in striking contrast to what was observed in quiescent cells, 1,25-(OH)2D3 diminished the mitogenic response to thrombin by as much as 50% in nonquiescent cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 also modulated the transcription of c-myc in response to thrombin. In quiescent cells, transcription was enhanced by 1,25-(OH)2D3, whereas in nonquiescent cells, thrombin-induced c-myc transcription was blunted. Thus, 1,25-(OH)2D3 is a potent modulator of the growth of cultured VSM. The direction of this modulation depends strongly on the conditions under which the cells are cultured.\r"

  ".U": "91250538\r", 
  ".W": "Hematogenous infection with the yeast Candida albicans now occurs with increasing frequency in the neonate, the immunocompromised patient, and the hyperglycemic or hyperalimented host. Yeast-phase C. albicans expresses a protein that is antigenically and structurally related to CD11b/CD18, a member of the beta 2 integrins and a well-characterized adhesin for mammalian neutrophils. Both the neutrophil protein and its analogue in C. albicans have an identical affinity for the C3 ligand iC3b, and both proteins are significantly increased in expression at 37 degrees C. Given these several similarities, we therefore studied the role of the integrin analogue on C. albicans in the adhesion of the yeast to human umbilical vein endothelium (HUVE). After growth of C. albicans in 20 mM D-glucose, as opposed to 20 mM L-glutamate, flow cytometric analysis with monoclonal antibodies recognizing the alpha-subunit of CD11b/CD18 demonstrated a 25.0% increase in mean channel fluorescence (range 18.4-31.8%), as well as an increased percentage of yeasts fluorescing (P less than 0.02). This increased intensity of fluorescence, which corresponds to increased expression of the integrin analogue, also correlated with a significant increase of 30-80% in adhesion of glucose-grown C. albicans to HUVE (P less than 0.02). Blockade of the integrin analogue on C. albicans by monoclonal antibodies recognizing adhesive epitopes on neutrophil CD11b/CD18 inhibited glucose-enhanced adhesion of C. albicans to HUVE. Incubation of glucose-grown C. albicans with saturating concentrations of purified human iC3b, the ligand for CD11b/CD18, reduced adhesion of the yeast to HUVE by 49.7%, whereas BSA in equimolar concentration had no effect (P less than 0.001). These results identify a glucose-responsive integrin analogue on C. albicans as one of possibly several cellular structures that mediate adhesion of the yeast to human endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "T84 cells, a human intestinal epithelial cell line, serve as a model of electrogenic Cl- secretion. We find that cAMP-elicited Cl- secretion in T84 cells is accompanied by a marked redistribution of F-actin in the basolateral portion of the cell. To prevent this F-actin redistribution and thereby assess its importance to Cl- secretion, we have defined simple conditions under which this model epithelium can be loaded with nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-phallicidin. This reagent binds F-actin with high affinity thus stabilizing the F-actin cytoskeleton by preventing depolymerization, an event necessary for dynamic reordering of actin microfilaments. NBD-phallicidin loading is not cytotoxic as assessed by lactic dehydrogenase release, protein synthesis, transepithelial resistance, and the ability of the loaded cells to pump Na+ in an absorptive direction in response to the apical addition of a Na+ ionophore. However, cAMP-elicited redistribution of F-actin and the cAMP-elicited Cl- secretory response are both markedly impaired in NBD-phallicidin preloaded T84 cells. In contrast, the carbachol-elicited Cl- secretory response (Ca++ mediated) is not attenuated by NBD-phallicidin preloading nor is it accompanied by redistribution of F-actin. These findings suggest that the cAMP-elicited cytoskeletal redistribution we describe is an integral part of cAMP-elicited Cl- secretion in T84 cells.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 are thought to mediate many of the pathophysiologic changes of endotoxemia and Gram-negative bacteremia. In these studies, heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis were infused into rabbits to determine whether an endotoxin (LPS)-free microorganism also elicits cytokinemia and the physiologic abnormalities seen in Gram-negative bacteremia. S. epidermidis induced complement activation, circulating TNF and IL-1, and hypotension to the same degree as did one-twentieth the number of heat-killed Escherichia coli. Circulating IL-1 beta levels had a greater correlation coefficient (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) with the degree of hypotension than TNF levels (r = 0.48, P less than 0.02). Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diffuse pulmonary capillary aggregation of neutrophils, and hepatic necrosis with neutrophil infiltration were observed to the same extent after either S. epidermidis or E. coli infusion. However, S. epidermidis infusion did not induce significant (less than 60 pg/ml) endotoxemia, whereas E. coli infusion resulted in high (11,000 pg/ml) serum endotoxin levels. S. epidermidis, E. coli, LPS, or S. epidermidis-derived lipoteichoic acid (LTA) induced TNF and IL-1 from blood mononuclear cells in vitro. E. coli organisms and LPS were at least 100-fold more potent than S. epidermidis or LTA. Thus, a shock-like state with similar levels of complement activation as well as circulating levels of IL-1 and TNF were observed following either S. epidermidis or E. coli. These data provide further evidence that host factors such as IL-1 and TNF are common mediators of the septic shock syndrome regardless of the organism.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchoconstriction (BC) is the main feature of anaphylaxis in the guinea pig. Since LPS induces lung inflammation and antigen-induced BC depends on the endogenous formation of histamine and arachidonate metabolites, we studied whether LPS might modulate antigen-induced BC. Guinea pigs were sensitized subcutaneously with 10 micrograms ovalbumin (OA) on days 0 and 14. LPS (100 micrograms/kg) was injected intravenously on day 21, and daily injections of LPS were continued before the antigenic challenge on day 22, 23, 24, or 25. Intratracheal injection of 100 micrograms OA induced an abrupt and reversible BC. Single or repetitive injections of LPS reduced BC. LPS is likely to reduce the OA-induced BC by affecting the histamine-dependent component of BC, since (a) LPS induced a partial degranulation of lung mast cells; (b) BC is reduced by mepyramine, an histamine receptor antagonist; (c) LPS did not affect BC in mepyramine-treated guinea pigs; (d) LPS reduced histamine release by OA-stimulated guinea pig lungs in vitro. Moreover, the in vitro OA-induced production of arachidonate metabolites was also reduced by LPS. The decreased formation of TXB2 was not only secondary to a reduced release of histamine, since LPS inhibited TXB2 formation in the presence of mepyramine. Finally, the FMLP-induced BC and mediator release were inhibited by LPS, whereas the platelet activating factor-induced pulmonary responses were not. Thus, the protective effect of LPS is not antigen-specific and does not result from a general desensitization. These studies indicate that a single dose of LPS reduces the antigen-induced BC by reducing histamine release from lung mast cells, although a decreased formation of eicosanoids may contribute to the protective effect of LPS.\r"

  ".W": "The Dra antigen belongs to the Cromer-related blood group system, a series of antigens on decay accelerating factor (DAF), a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein that protects host cells from complement-mediated damage. We studied the rare inherited Dr(a-) phenotype to ascertain the associated biochemical and functional changes in DAF and to characterize the basis for this polymorphism. Radioimmunoassay assay and flow cytometric analysis of Dr(a-) erythrocytes demonstrated 40% of normal surface expression of DAF but normal levels of several other glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, distinguishing this phenotype from that of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Western blots confirmed this reduced DAF expression and indicated a slightly faster mobility of the molecule on SDS-PAGE. Despite the reduced DAF expression, Dr(a-) erythrocytes functioned normally in the complement lysis sensitivity assay. Utilization of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify mononuclear cell genomic DNA from three unrelated Dr(a-) individuals demonstrated that a point mutation underlies the Dr(a-) phenotype: a C to T change in nucleotide 649 resulting in a serine165 to leucine change. This defines the Drb allele of DAF, which can be distinguished from Dra by a Taq I restriction fragment length polymorphism. We created transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing either the Dra or the Drb allelic form of DAF. These allele-specific transfectants were tested by inhibition of hemagglutination or flow cytometry and confirmed the specificity of anti-Dra alloantisera. The allele-specific transfectants could form the basis of a new serological approach to immunohematology.\r"

  ".W": "Animal studies have demonstrated that activation of the baroreflex by increases in arterial pressure inhibits cardiovascular and ventilatory responses to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors (PC) with hypoxia. In this study, we examined the influences of baroreflex activation on the sympathetic response to stimulation of PC and central chemoreceptors in humans. PC were stimulated by hypoxia (10% O2/90% N2) (n = 6) and central chemoreceptors by hypercapnia (7% CO2/93% O2) (n = 6). Responses to a cold pressor stimulus were also obtained as an internal reflex control to determine the selectivity of the interactive influence of baroreflex activation. Baroreflex activation was achieved by raising mean blood pressure by greater than 10 mmHg with intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (PE). Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) to muscle was recorded from a peroneal nerve (microneurography). During hypoxia alone, SNA increased from 255 +/- 92 to 354 +/- 107 U/min (P less than 0.05). During PE alone, mean blood pressure increased and SNA decreased to 87 +/- 45 U/min (P less than 0.05). With hypoxia during baroreflex activation with PE, SNA did not increase (50 +/- 23 U/min). During hypercapnia alone, SNA increased from 116 +/- 39 to 234 +/- 72 U/min (P less than 0.01). Hypercapnia during baroreflex activation with PE increased SNA from 32 +/- 25 U/min during PE alone to 61 +/- 26 U/min during hypercapnia and PE (P less than 0.05). Like hypercapnia (but unlike hypoxia) the cold pressor test also increased SNA during PE. We conclude that baroreflex activation selectively abolishes the SNA response to hypoxia but not to hypercapnia or the cold pressor test. The inhibitory interaction of the baroreflex and the peripheral chemoreflex may be explained by convergence of baroreceptor and peripheral chemoreceptor afferents on neurons in the medulla.\r"

After 7 d of culture, hypodense eosinophils stimulated with 2 x 10(-7) M FMLP generated 26 ng LTC4/10(6) cells, and LTC4 biosynthesis was blocked by N-tertbutoxy-carbonyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (N-t-BOC-MLP). Neither calcium ionophore stimulation of LTC4 from endogenous arachidonic acid nor substrate-initiated production of LTC4 from incorporated LTA4 changed when eosinophils were cocultured with GM-CSF and 3T3 fibroblasts. Furthermore, when incubated with 10(-6) M FMLP, normodense eosinophils generated no net superoxide measured by the reduction of cytochrome c, whereas replicate eosinophils cultured for 7 d with 10(-11) M GM-CSF and 3T3 fibroblasts reduced a net of 17 nmol of cytochrome c/10(6) cells. These studies suggest that primed and phenotypically altered eosinophils present at an extravascular site may exert pathobiologic effects by responding to soluble ligands in the tissues.\r"

In four awake dogs, coronary dimension crystals were chronically implanted on the circumflex artery for the measurement of epicardial coronary diameter, and Doppler flow probes were implanted for quantitation of phasic coronary blood flow (vasomotion of distal regulatory resistance vessels). Basal epicardial coronary diameter, acetylcholine-stimulated endothelium-dependent dilation, and flow-induced endothelium-dependent dilation of the epicardial arteries and phasic blood flow were recorded before, and after 5, 15, 50, and 120 mg/kg of L-NMMA. L-NMMA induced a dose-related increase in basal epicardial coronary vasomotor tone. There was an accompanying increase in aortic pressure and a decrease in heart rate. At doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg, rest phasic coronary blood flow was also decreased. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and contractility were not significantly changed. In contrast, the flow-induced or acetylcholine-stimulated endothelium-dependent responses were attenuated only after infusion of the highest does of L-NMMA (120 mg/kg). The changes in the basal vasomotor tone and acetylcholine-stimulated endothelium-dependent responses returned towards the control states in the presence of L-arginine (660 mg/kg). These data support the view that nitric oxide plays a significant role in modulating basal vasomotion and endothelial-dependent dilation stimulated by acetylcholine or increase in blood flow in epicardial coronary arteries and also influence the regulation of coronary blood flow during physiologic conditions.\r"

  ".U": "91250549\r", 
  ".W": "Thyroid hormone (T3) resistance is inherited in most cases in an autosomal dominant manner. The disorder is characterized by elevated free thyroid hormone levels and partial resistance to thyroid hormone at the cellular level. Distinct single amino acid substitutions in the ligand binding domain of the beta form of the thyroid hormone receptor have been described in two kindreds with this disorder. We used transient expression assays to characterize the functional properties of these receptor mutants, one containing a Gly to Arg change at amino acid 340 (G340R) and the other a Pro to His change at amino acid 448 (P448H). A nine amino acid carboxy terminal deletion (delta 448-456), analogous to an alteration that occurs in v-erbA, was also studied for comparison with the mutations that occur in the T3 resistance syndrome. None of the receptor mutants were able to mediate thyroid hormone dependent activation (TreTKCAT) or repression (TSH alpha CAT) of reporter genes when compared with the wild type receptor. In addition, the mutants inhibited the activity of normal alpha and beta receptor isoforms when examined in coexpression assays. This activity, referred to as dominant negative inhibition, was manifest with respect to both the positively and negatively regulated reporter genes. Although mutant receptor binding to DNA was unaffected, ligand binding studies showed that the G340R and delta 448-456 mutants failed to bind T3, whereas the P448H mutant bound hormone with reduced affinity (approximately 10% of normal) compared to the wild type receptor. Consistent with this finding, the P448H mutant receptor was partially active at higher T3 concentrations. Furthermore, the dominant negative inhibition elicited by the P448H receptor mutant at higher T3 concentrations was reversed in the presence of high doses of T3. These findings indicate that mutant beta receptors in patients with thyroid hormone resistance have reduced affinity for T3 and are functionally deficient, but impair the activity of normal receptors, thereby providing a mechanism for the dominant mode of inheritance in this disorder.\r"

Ultrastructural studies suggest that this anomaly results from erratic subdivision of megakaryocyte cytoplasm into platelets. In this study, we have examined protein profiles of platelets of WF rats for biochemical abnormalities associated with this anomaly. Marked decreases in protein bands with an Mr of 185, 57, 53, 16, 13, and 8 kd were observed in one-dimensional reduced SDS-PAGE gels in WF platelets compared with platelets of Wistar, Long Evans, and Sprague-Dawley rats. These proteins were released into the supernatant when washed platelets were treated with thrombin suggesting that they were alpha-granule proteins. These abnormalities were not present in offspring of crosses between Wistar Furth and Wistar rats; however, they were present in platelets of offspring with large MPV derived from backcrosses of (WF X Wistar) F1 males to WF females, but not in backcross offspring with normal platelet size. Immunoblotting confirmed decreased levels of thrombospondin, fibrinogen, and platelet factor 4 in WF platelets. Electron microscopic examination revealed that platelet alpha granules were usually smaller in Wistar Furth than in Wistar rats. In addition, immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that the surface connected canalicular system of the large Wistar Furth platelets, contained dense material composed of alpha-granule proteins, not present in Wistar platelets. From these results, we conclude that the Wistar Furth rat platelet phenotype of large mean platelet volume and decreased levels of alpha-granule proteins represents an animal model resembling gray platelet syndrome. The autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance of the large MPV phenotype and platelet alpha-granule protein deficiencies suggests that a component common to both formation of platelet alpha granules, and subdivision of megakaryocyte cytoplasm into platelets, is quantitatively or qualitatively abnormal in Wistar Furth rat megakaryocytes and platelets.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inhibits sodium absorption (JNa) in the rabbit cortical collecting duct (CCD) was explored. PGE2 activates at least three signaling mechanisms in the CCD: (a) by itself PGE2 increases cAMP generation (b) PGE2 also inhibits vasopressin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, and (c) PGE2 raises intracellular calcium([Ca++]i). We tested the contribution of these signaling pathways to PGE2's effect on Na+ absorption, measuring 22Na flux (JNa) and [Ca++]i (using fura-2) in microperfused rabbit CCDs. In control studies PGE2 reduced JNa from 28.2 +/- 3.4 to 15.6 +/- 2.6 pmol.mm-1.min-1. Lowering bath calcium from 2.4 to 45 nM did not by itself alter JNa but in this setting PGE2 failed to inhibit JNa (28.6 +/- 5.4 to 38.5 +/- 4.0). In separate tubules, PGE2 raised [Ca++]i in a spike-like fashion followed by a sustained elevation. However, in 45 nM bath Ca++, PGE2 failed to produce a sustained [Ca++]i elevation. While pretreatment of CCDs with pertussis toxin blocked PGE2 inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated water permeability, it did not block the effect of PGE2 on JNa. To see if cAMP generation contributes to the effect of PGE2 on JNa, we tested the effect of exogenous cAMP, (8-chlorophenylthio(CPT)cAMP) on JNa. 0.1 mM 8-CPTcAMP reduced JNa from 35.75 +/- 2.3 to 21.6 +/- 2.2. However, the addition of PGE2 further blunted JNa to 15.9 +/- 1.3. In CCDs pretreated with indomethacin, 8-CPTcAMP did not significantly decrease JNa 33.6 +/- 2.8 vs. 28.4 +/- 2. However, superimposed PGE2 reduced JNa to 19.0 +/- 3.0. We conclude that PGE2 inhibits sodium transport predominantly by increasing intracellular calcium. This action is not mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Finally, cAMP, through a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism, also inhibits CCD JNa and may contribute to the effects of PGE2 on JNa in the rabbit CCD.\r"

Typically, missense mutations have predominated and show a preferential localization to exons 4 and 5. This distribution supports earlier studies attributing functional significance to residues encoded by these exons. We now report a further missense mutation within exon 5 of the LPL gene in three unrelated patients. Amplification of individual exons by the polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing revealed a T----C transition at codon 194 of the LPL cDNA which results in a substitution of threonine for isoleucine at this residue. The catalytic abnormality induced by this mutation was confirmed through in vitro mutagenesis studies in COS-1 cells. Transfection with a LPL cDNA containing the codon 194 transition resulted in the synthesis and secretion of a catalytically defective protein. The Thr194 substitution was associated with two different DNA haplotypes, consistent with a multicentric origin for this mutation.\r"

Three responses were studied, the transient rise in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) (derived from indo-1 fluorescence), shape changes (measured by laser turbidimetry), and exocytosis of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) (assessed by H2O2/luminol-dependent chemiluminescence). Responses were obtained with all four agonists, but C5a and PAF were by far more potent than FMLP and NAP-1/IL-8, which induced only minor effects. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin attenuated [Ca2+]i changes, EPO release and, to a lesser extent, shape changes, indicating that GTP-binding proteins of Gi-type are involved in receptor-dependent signal transduction processes leading to these responses. A clear dissociation was observed in the control of the shape change response and EPO exocytosis. The shape change was not affected by Ca2+ depletion or treatment with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, but exocytosis was prevented by Ca2+ depletion and markedly enhanced by staurosporine. The activation of the contractile system, leading to shape changes and motility, thus appears to be independent of the classical signal transduction pathway involving phospholipase C, a [Ca2+]i rise and protein kinase C activation. Exocytosis is, as expected, Ca2+ dependent and appears to be under a negative control involving protein phosphorylations.\r"

In either case, these rearrangements provide useful clonal markers for the leukemias in question. In the t(1;14)(p34;q11) translocation associated with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the breakpoints on chromosome 1 interrupt the tal-1 gene. A site-specific deletion interrupts the same gene in an additional 26% of T-ALL. Thus, nearly one-third of these leukemias contain clustered rearrangements of the tal-1 locus. To test whether these rearrangements can serve as markers for residual disease, we monitored four patients with T-ALL; three of the leukemias contained a deleted (tald) and one a translocated (talt) tal-1 allele. These alleles were recognized by a sensitive amplification/hybridization assay. tald alleles were found in the blood of one patient during the 4th mo of treatment but not thereafter. Using a quantitative assay to measure the fraction of tald alleles in DNA extracts, we estimated that this month 4 sample contained 150 tald copies per 10(6) genome copies. The patient with t(1;14)(p34;q11) (talt) leukemia developed a positive assay during the 20th mo of treatment. By standard criteria, all four patients remain in complete remission 11-20 mo into treatment. We conclude that tal-1 rearrangements provide useful clonal markers for approximately 30% of T-ALLs.\r"

Both leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and macromolecular leakage from postcapillary venules hallmark the microcirculatory failure after ischemia-reperfusion, suggesting a role of leukotrienes as mediators of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using the dorsal skinfold chamber model for intravital fluorescence microscopy of the microcirculation in striated muscle in awake hamsters and sequential RP-HPLC and RIA for leukotrienes, we demonstrate in this study that (a) the leukotrienes (LT)B4 and LTD4 elicit leukocyte/endothelium interaction and macromolecular leakage from postcapillary venules, respectively, that (b) leukotrienes accumulate in the tissue after ischemia and reperfusion, and that (c) selective inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis (by MK-886) prevents both postischemic leukotriene accumulation and the microcirculatory changes after ischemia-reperfusion, while blocking of LTD4/E4 receptors (by MK-571) inhibits postischemic macromolecular leakage. These results demonstrate a key role of leukotrienes in ischemia-reperfusion injury in striated muscle in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "DNA from 135 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at various clinical stages and Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia was investigated for alterations in a variety of proto-oncogenes which have been implicated in the evolution of CML from its chronic phase to blast crisis. The most common genetic change found in the evolution of typical Ph1 chromosome positive CML to blast crisis was an alteration of the p53 gene involving either a rearrangement, a deletion, or a point mutation in the coding sequence of the gene. Alterations of the p53 gene were found in the myeloid and the rare megakaryocytic variant of blast crisis but were absent in the lymphoid leukemic transformants. Gross structural alterations were seen in 11 of 54 (20%) of myeloid or unknown phenotypes of blast crisis and in only 1 of 44 chronic phase cases. Eight examples of mutations in the open reading frame of the p53 gene at codons 49, 53, 60, 140, 202, 204, 238, and 239 were observed in blast crisis patients. Mutations in the N-RAS gene were rare in typical blast crisis (2 of 27 cases) but were found in megakaryocytic and Ph1 negative myeloid blast crisis. We concluded that heterogeneous alterations in the p53 gene and occasionally in the N-RAS genes accompany the evolution of chronic phase CML to blast crisis.\r"

  ".W": "The development of the Na/H antiporter was studied in renal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from fetal and adult rabbits using isotopic and fluorescent techniques. The kinetics of the antiporter studied by 22Na+ uptake revealed that the Vmax was only 25% of that in the adult; however, the Km's for Na+ were not significantly different. These data were confirmed by a fluorescent assay using the pH-sensitive probe, acridine orange: the Vmax was significantly lower in the fetal BBMV. Conductive Na+ movement was estimated from amiloride-insensitive 22Na+ uptake and the rate of alkalinization induced by K+, an ion whose relative conductance was found to be similar to that of Na+. Although relative Na+ conductance was significantly greater in fetal BBMV, the lower Vmax in fetal vesicles could not be ascribed to this factor. Maternal administration of betamethasone (50 micrograms/kg intramuscularly) for 2 d before delivery significantly increased the Vmax of the antiporter to levels observed in the adult; Km was unaffected. Na/K ATPase activity increased fourfold after betamethasone, but the specific activities of four brush border marker enzymes and the kinetics of Na(+)-glucose cotransport were unchanged. These data indicate that there is a developmental increase in brush border Na/H exchange which is the result of an increase in the number and/or the turnover number of the carriers. Further, these data suggest that the postnatal increase in antiporter activity may be related to the surge in glucocorticoid concentration that occurs perinatally.\r"

  ".W": "It is known that long-standing volume overload on the left ventricle due to mitral regurgitation eventually leads to contractile dysfunction. However, it is unknown whether or not correction of the volume overload can lead to recovery of contractility. In this study we tested the hypothesis that depressed contractile function due to volume overload in mitral regurgitation could return toward normal after mitral valve replacement. Using a canine model of mitral regurgitation which is known to produce contractile dysfunction, we examined contractile function longitudinally in seven dogs at baseline, after 3 mo of mitral regurgitation, 1 mo after mitral valve replacement, and 3 mo after mitral valve replacement. After 3 mo of mitral regurgitation (regurgitant fraction 0.62 +/- 0.04), end-diastolic volume had nearly doubled from 68 +/- 6.8 to 123 +/- 12.1 ml (P less than 0.05). All five indices of contractile function which we examined were depressed. For instance, maximum fiber elastance (EmaxF) obtained by assessment of time-varying elastance decreased from 5.95 +/- 0.71 to 2.25 +/- 0.18 (P less than 0.05). The end-systolic stiffness constant (k) was also depressed from 4.2 +/- 0.4 to 2.1 +/- 0.3. 3 mo after mitral valve replacement all indexes of contractile function had returned to or toward normal (e.g., EmaxF 3.65 +/- 0.21 and k 4.2 +/- 0.3). We conclude that previously depressed contractile function due to volume overload can improve after correction of the overload.\r"

While the selective V1 receptor agonist [Ho1, Phe2, Orn8] VT has no effect on inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production over the range of 10(-13)-10(-7) M, the selective V2 receptor agonist VDAVP stimulates IP3 production in dose-dependent fashion. Oxytocin stimulates IP3 production in dose-dependent fashion as well. AVP-stimulated phospholipase C activity is not inhibited by the V1 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP(10(-7) M) but is eliminated by the V2 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5DTyr(Et)VAVP (10(-7) M). Similarly, the response to oxytocin is eliminated by the V2 receptor antagonist. The selective oxytocin receptor agonist [Thr4, Gly7] oxytocin does not stimulate cAMP production in RIMCT cells but does promote PI hydrolysis. The selective oxytocin receptor antagonist desGlyNH2d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)-Thr4]OVT (10(-7) M) does not inhibit AVP-stimulated cAMP production but eliminates IP3 production in response to AVP or the V2 receptor agonist VDAVP. These studies demonstrate that AVP or a V2 receptor agonist stimulate PI hydrolysis in cultured RIMCT cells via occupancy of the oxytocin receptor.\r"

  ".U": "91250568\r", 
  ".W": "Recent molecular studies have shown that in a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) Kobe, the size of exon 19 of the dystrophin gene was reduced to 36 bp due to the deletion of 52 bp out of 88 bp of the exon. The consensus sequences at the 5' and 3' splice sites of exon 19 were unaltered (Matsuo, M., et al. 1990. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 170:963-967). To further elucidate the molecular nature of the defect, we examined the primary structure of cytoplasmic dystrophin mRNA of the DMD Kobe patient across the junctions of exons 18, 19, and 20 by gel electrophoresis and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA. The mRNA coding for dystrophin was reverse transcribed using random primers, and the cDNA was then enzymatically amplified in vitro. The targeted fragment was smaller than expected from the genomic DNA analysis. By sequencing of the amplified product, we found that exon 18 was joined directly to exon 20, so that exon 19 was completely absent, suggesting that this exon was skipped during processing of the dystrophin mRNA precursor. All other bases in the amplified product were unaltered. Therefore, the data strongly suggest that the internal exon deletion generates an abnormally spliced mRNA in which the sequence of exon 18 is joined to the sequence of exon 20. We propose that the deletion is responsible for abnormal processing of the DMD Kobe allele. This finding has important implications regarding the determinants of a functional splice site.\r"

  ".W": "The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins in the pathogenesis of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical cancer is poorly understood. To characterize E4 protein expression in 49 paraffin-embedded cervical biopsies representing different histopathologic grades of disease, antibodies were elicited to a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 20-34 of a protein predicted to be encoded by the HPV 16 E4 open reading frame. The E4 protein was detected throughout the spectrum of CIN, from CIN1 to CIN3. Expression was localized to the cell nucleus, primarily in the superficial layers of the squamous cervical epithelium. Ultrastructural studies showed that the E4 protein was organized into compact, intranuclear arrays 25-35 nm in diameter. E4 protein expression was also demonstrated in some histologically normal tissues containing HPV 16 DNA, but not in any of five cervical cancers containing HPV 16 DNA. These results suggest that E4 protein expression may precede development of light microscopic tissue abnormalities, that it may continue through the spectrum of CIN, and that expression of this protein may be reduced or terminated in invasive cancer. The function of this protein remains unknown, but its nuclear localization may be consistent with a role in viral maturation.\r"

In the chromatin of erythroid cells the locus control region is characterized by four DNaseI hypersensitive sites that are located 6-18 kb 5' of the epsilon globin gene. The definition of the sequences minimally required for locus control region activity is likely to further the understanding of its physiology and will be of interest for the development of somatic gene therapy strategies of the hemoglobinopathies. We present here the analysis of a family with a 3,030-bp deletion of sequences upstream of the epsilon globin gene including the most 3' locus control region element and cosegregating beta degree thalassemia. The deletion is linked in cis to a structurally and functionally normal beta globin gene. The proximal element of the locus control region does not therefore appear to be necessary for beta globin gene activity in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-4 is a T lymphocyte- and mast cell-derived cytokine with pleiotropic properties with biological effects on a variety of target cells including B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, hematopoietic cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts. In addition to the proliferation effect of IL-4 on fibroblasts, which has been previously described, in this report the chemotactic properties of IL-4 for fibroblasts is described. Human recombinant IL-4 induced the chemotactic migration of dermal fibroblasts in vitro in modified Boyden-type chambers at concentrations between 10(-12) and 10(-11) M. The chemotactic activity of IL-4 was neutralized by anti-human recombinant IL-4 IgG antibodies. Oligopeptides representing the complete deduced amino acid sequence of human IL-4 were synthesized by the Merrifield technique and tested for their ability to induce fibroblast chemotaxis. Two peptides representing residues 70-88 and 89-122 induced fibroblast migration. Peptide 70-88 was the more potent of the two causing chemotaxis of fibroblasts at 10(-8)-10(-6) M while peptide 89-129 induced migration at 10(-7)-10(-5) M. Although the mechanism by which IL-4 and these two peptides induce fibroblast chemotaxis is unknown, each of these three compounds were able to chemotactically desensitize fibroblasts to the chemotactic effects of the other two but not to a structurally unrelated chemotactic cytokine, transforming growth factor beta-1. These studies suggest that IL-4 might function in vivo to induce the accumulation of fibroblasts at sites of tissue injury, inflammatory and immune reactions in which T lymphocytes and mast cells participate.\r"

  ".W": "Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a cholesterol-rich lipoprotein that is distinguished by its content of a glycoprotein called apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. Apo(a) varies in size among individuals owing to different numbers of cysteine-rich sequences that are homologous to kringle 4 of plasminogen. The genetic basis for this variation is not understood at the genomic level. In this study we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and genomic blotting to identify a highly polymorphic restriction fragment from the apo(a) gene. The fragment contains multiple tandem repeats of a kringle 4-encoding sequence and varies in length from 48 to 190 kb depending on the number of kringle 4-encoding sequences. A total of 19 different alleles were identified among 102 unrelated Caucasian Americans. 94% of individuals studied had two different alleles which could be distinguished by size on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The degree of size heterogeneity was much greater than had been previously appreciated based on the analysis of the apparent molecular mass of the protein. The size of the apo(a) gene correlated directly with the size of the apo(a) protein, and inversely with the concentration of Lp(a) in plasma. Segregation analysis of the apo(a) gene was performed in families; siblings with identical apo(a) genotypes had similar plasma levels of Lp(a). These results suggest that in the normal population, the level of plasma Lp(a) is largely determined by alleles at the apo(a) locus.\r"

During continuous exposure to oxygen, both control and transgenic animals who successfully adapted to hyperoxia showed increased activity of lung antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), whereas superoxide dismutase activity remained unchanged. The results show that expression of elevated levels of CuZnSOD decreases pulmonary oxygen toxicity and associated histologic damage and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Spectrin alpha-chain mutants associated with hereditary elliptocytosis are highly variable in their level of expression. It has been assumed that the degree of elliptocytosis can be increased when the spectrin alpha chain, encoded by the alpha gene in trans to the variant, is expressed at a low level. We now provide strong evidence for the existence of low-level expression of spectrin alpha chains. This condition is referred to as the alpha V/41 polymorphism. It has been observed in 15 different families or individuals of French, North African, and African ancestry in which seven distinct elliptocytogenic alpha-spectrin variants were co-inherited. Whenever the alpha V/41 polymorphism was present, the severity of the biochemical, morphological, and, sometimes, the clinical phenotype of elliptocytosis was increased. The alpha V/41 polymorphism was also frequently encountered among 36 unrelated control subjects in the heterozygous or homozygous states, and was entirely asymptomatic in both cases. The main biochemical feature was an increased susceptibility to proteolysis of the alpha IV-alpha V domain junction. Alteration of the facing beta IV domain of spectrin was demonstrated by in vitro spectrin dimer reconstitution experiments. It appears that the alpha V/41 polymorphism is often required for alpha-spectrin elliptocytogenic variants to become manifest in the heterozygous state. Thus, alpha-spectrin-related elliptocytosis may be viewed as a bifactorial condition.\r"

We have found that the total B cell secretion did not vary significantly in these successive glucose stimulations and that, under these conditions, the majority of B cells that were stimulated to release insulin during the first incubation also secreted during the second, third, and, when this was tested, during the fourth incubation. Similarly, most of the B cells that did not release detectable amounts of insulin during the first incubation did not secrete also during the two (or three) subsequent secretion tests. Together, the two groups of B cells that showed a constant secretory pattern, represented approximately 75% of the entire B cell population. The remaining 25% of B cells shifted from a secreting to a non-secreting state, or vice versa, from one incubation to another. These observations were made under three different time frames in which we tested single B cells as well as B cell clusters at rather different intervals. These findings support the existence of distinct B cell subpopulations differing lastingly in their ability to secrete insulin in response to glucose.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine whether altered glucose transporter expression is essential for the in vivo insulin-resistant glucose uptake characteristic of streptozocin-induced diabetes. Immunofluorescence in rat skeletal muscle colocalizes GLUT4 with dystrophin, both intrinsic to muscle fibers. In contrast, GLUT1 is extrinsic to muscle fibers, probably in perineurial sheath. Immunoblotting shows that levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein per DNA in hindlimb muscle are unaltered from control levels at 7 d of diabetes but decrease to approximately 20% of control at 14 d of diabetes. This decrease is prevented by insulin treatment. In adipose cells of 7 d diabetic rats, GLUT4 levels are depressed. Thus, GLUT4 undergoes tissue-specific regulation in response to diabetes. GLUT4 and GLUT1 mRNA levels in muscle are decreased 62-70% at both 7 and 14 d of diabetes and are restored by insulin treatment. At 7 d of diabetes, when GLUT4 protein levels in muscle are unaltered, in vivo insulin-stimulated glucose uptake measured by euglycemic clamp is 54% of control. This reflects impairment in both glycogen synthesis and glycolysis and the substrate common to these two pathways, glucose-6-phosphate, is decreased approximately 30% in muscle of diabetic rats. These findings suggest a defect early in the pathway of glucose utilization, probably at the step of glucose transport. Because GLUT1 and GLUT4 levels are unaltered at 7 d of diabetes, reduced glucose uptake in muscle probably reflects impaired glucose transporter translocation or intrinsic activity. Later, at 14 d of diabetes, GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein levels are reduced, suggesting that sequential defects may contribute to the insulin-resistant glucose transport characteristic of diabetes.\r"

Screening of 228 alleles in 114 individuals for sequence differences by RNase protection of genomic DNA revealed no detectable polymorphisms in SLPI gene exons II-IV. SLPI gene expression in the lung was demonstrated by identifying SLPI mRNA transcripts in bronchial epithelial cells freshly isolated from normals. Cell lines derived from mucosal surfaces (HS-24 bronchial squamous cell carcinoma, HeLa cervical carcinoma) actively transcribe the SLPI gene and contain SLPI mRNA transcripts, while lung fibroblasts demonstrate no evidence of SLPI gene expression. SLPI mRNA transcripts appear to be relatively stable, with mRNA levels only mildly affected by inhibition of RNA synthesis. Chromatin DNA of HS-24 cells demonstrates two DNase I hypersensitivity sites within the 5' flanking region of exon I of the SLPI gene, whereas fibroblast chromatin has no DNase I accessible sites in the same region. Further analysis of the 5' flanking region demonstrated two contiguous transcription start sites, CAAT and TATA boxes, and several potential regions of known DNA binding proteins. Overall, the SLPI gene appears to be a relatively nonpolymorphic, stable gene that is constitutively expressed at specific tissue sites, but has the potential to be modulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.\r"

  ".W": "Autocrine and paracrine modulation of transforming growth factor expression was assessed in rat intestinal epithelial cell lines designated IEC-6 and IEC-7. Addition of the transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) homologue epidermal growth factor (EGF) to media of subconfluent IEC-6 cells led to autocrine stimulation of TGF alpha expression as well as increased expression of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1). Increased expression of TGF alpha was maximal between 3 and 6 h after addition of EGF and subsequently declined coincident with increasing level of expression of TGF beta 1, which achieved maximal levels 6 h after addition of EGF and was sustained for more than 12 h. Addition of TGF beta 1 also led to autocrine induction of its own expression coincident with suppression of TGF alpha expression. Addition of TGF beta 1 was associated with increased expression of beta-actin when standardized to a constitutive transcript (GAPDH). Similar responses to addition of EGF and TGF beta 1, were observed in another intestinal epithelial cell line, designated IEC-17. Modulation of expression of TGFs was attenuated when cells were grown on the complex extracellular matrix produced by the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (Matrigel), reflecting the baseline induction of TGF beta 1 expression when compared to IEC-6 and IEC-17 cells maintained on plastic. These observations suggest that expression of TGFs is controlled by autocrine mechanisms in intestinal epithelial cell lines and proliferation stimulated by TGF alpha may be initially self-reinforcing but ultimately downregulated by induction of TGF beta 1.\r"

  ".U": "91250581\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the relationship between insulin receptor (IR) kinase activity and insulin action in vivo in humans, we measured glucose disposal rates (GDR) during a series of euglycemic clamp studies. Simultaneously, we measured IR kinase activity in IRs extracted from skeletal muscle obtained by needle biopsy at the end of each clamp. By preserving the phosphorylation state of the receptors as it existed in vivo at the time of biopsy, we could correlate GDR and IR kinase in skeletal muscle. Eight nondiabetic, nonobese male subjects underwent studies at insulin infusion rates of 0, 40, 120, and 1,200 mU/m2 per min. Kinase activity, determined with receptors immobilized on insulin agarose beads, was measured at 0.5 microM ATP, with 1 mg/ml histone, followed by SDS-PAGE. Insulin increased GDR approximately sevenfold with a half-maximal effect at approximately 100 microU/ml insulin and a maximal effect by approximately 400 microU/ml. Insulin also increased IR kinase activity; the half-maximal effect occurred at approximately 500-600 microU/ml insulin with a maximal 10-fold stimulation over basal. Within the physiologic range of insulin concentrations, GDR increased linearly with kinase activation (P less than 0.0006); at supraphysiologic insulin levels, this relationship became curvilinear. Half-maximal and maximal insulin-stimulated GDR occurred at approximately 20 and approximately 50% maximal kinase activation, respectively. These results are consistent with a role of the kinase in insulin action in vivo. Furthermore, they demonstrate the presence of a large amount of \"spare kinase\" for glucose disposal.\r"

Quiescent cultured fibroblasts in the absence of ascorbic acid have a high constitutive level of collagen production, but the mechanisms of collagen gene regulation in this unstimulated state are not known. Because lipid peroxidation also occurs in normal cells, we wondered if lipid peroxidation plays a role in the regulation of basal collagen gene expression. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation in cultured human fibroblasts with d-alpha-tocopherol or methylene blue decreased the synthesis of collagen, the steady-state levels of procollagen alpha 1(I) mRNA and the transcription of the procollagen alpha 1(I) gene. This effect on collagen gene expression was selective and not associated with cellular toxicity. Thus, these experiments suggest a role for lipid peroxidation in the modulation of constitutive collagen gene expression.\r"

To examine the events leading to the attachment of staphylococci to endothelium, adherence assays were developed to study the role of blood factors in the mediation of staphylococcal adherence to cultured human umbilical vein endothelium in vitro. Results indicate that the preferential attachment of S. aureus to endothelial cells is mediated by fibrinogen adsorbed from plasma onto the endothelial surface. The binding is apparently specific because it could be blocked by goat anti-human fibrinogen antibody in a dose-dependent fashion while nonimmune goat IgG, mouse MAb against AG-1 (a platelet antigen found on the endothelial cell surface), nonspecific mouse MAb and rabbit antibodies to human vitronectin and fibronectin were not inhibitory. Our data also indicate that fibrinogen is a necessary but not the only blood constituent in the mediation of binding of S. aureus to endothelium. This was supported by the finding that fibrinogen alone, at a concentration equivalent to that in plasma, did not potentiate staphylococcal adherence as much as plasma while afibrinogenemic plasma reconstituted with fibrinogen did. Because fibrinogen is known to bind to endothelial cells, our data is consistent with the hypothesis that fibrinogen and additional plasma factor(s), possibly activated during inflammation, promote staphylococcal adherence to endothelium. In addition, the role of the fibrinogen binding receptor of S. aureus as an adherence factor to native endothelium is also suggested.\r"

We sought to determine if insulin increases central sympathetic neural outflow and vascular resistance in humans. We recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; microneurography, peroneal nerve), forearm blood flow (plethysmography), heart rate, and blood pressure in 14 normotensive males during 1-h infusions of low (38 mU/m2/min) and high (76 mU/m2/min) doses of insulin while holding blood glucose constant. Plasma insulin rose from 8 +/- 1 microU/ml during control, to 72 +/- 8 and 144 +/- 13 microU/ml during the low and high insulin doses, respectively, and fell to 15 +/- 6 microU/ml 1 h after insulin infusion was stopped. MSNA, which averaged 21.5 +/- 1.5 bursts/min in control, increased significantly (P less than 0.001) during both the low and high doses of insulin (+/- 5.4 and +/- 9.3 bursts/min, respectively) and further increased during 1-h recovery (+15.2 bursts/min). Plasma norepinephrine levels (119 +/- 19 pg/ml during control) rose during both low (258 +/- 25; P less than 0.02) and high (285 +/- 95; P less than 0.01) doses of insulin and recovery (316 +/- 23; P less than 0.01). Plasma epinephrine levels did not change during insulin infusion. Despite the increased MSNA and plasma norepinephrine, there were significant (P less than 0.001) increases in forearm blood flow and decreases in forearm vascular resistance during both doses of insulin. Systolic pressure did not change significantly during infusion of insulin and diastolic pressure fell approximately 4-5 mmHg (P less than 0.01). This study suggests that acute increases in plasma insulin within the physiological range elevate sympathetic neural outflow but produce forearm vasodilation and do not elevate arterial pressure in normal humans.\r"

  ".W": "Minimally modified low density lipoprotein (MM-LDL), derived by mild iron oxidation or prolonged storage at 4 degrees C, has been shown to induce certain inflammatory responses in vascular cells in tissue culture. These include induction of monocyte (but not neutrophil) adherence to endothelial cells (EC), induction of EC production of colony stimulating factors (CSF), and induction of EC and smooth muscle cell production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1). To test for biologic activity in vivo, microgram quantities of MM-LDL were injected into mice, sera were assayed for CSF activity, and tissues were subjected to Northern analysis. After injection of MM-LDL, CSF activity increased approximately 7-26-fold but remained near control levels after injection of native LDL. Essentially all of the induced CSF activity was due to macrophage CSF as judged by antibody inhibition. Injection of MM-LDL into a mouse strain (C3H/HeJ) that is resistant to bacterial LPS gave similar results, indicating that the induction of CSF was not due to contaminating LPS and suggesting that there are differences in the pathways by which LPS and MM-LDL trigger cytokine production. In addition, after injection of MM-LDL, mRNA for JE, the mouse homologue of MCP-1, was markedly induced in various tissues, but was not induced after injection of native LDL. We conclude, therefore, that MM-LDL is biologically active in vivo and may contribute to the early stages of atherosclerosis by acting as an inflammatory agent.\r"

Surprisingly, the responsible metalloproteinase was identified as human interstitial collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1), an enzyme whose only known physiologic substrate has heretofore been believed to be the extracellular matrix molecule, collagen. The metalloproteinase inactivated the Serpins by cleaving peptide bonds at sites unrelated to those hydrolyzed in collagenous macromolecules. NH2-terminal sequence analysis localized the cleavage sites in the Serpins to regions near their respective reactive site centers at three distinct peptide bonds on the amino-terminal side of bulky, hydrophobic residues. Together, these data indicate that matrix metalloproteinase-1 displays an expanded substrate repertoire that supports the existence of a new interface between connective tissue turnover and Serpin function.\r"

Small superficial lipomas may be treated by suction lipectomy and the surrounding area can be contoured symmetrically at the same time, whereas large ones can be liposuctioned completely without extensive surgical extirpation and morbidity.

However, it is unknown whether oxygen diffusion around the perimeter of venous ulcers is uniformly affected. In this study, we investigated TcPO2 values at four different quadrants around the ulcers of 14 patients, the contralateral leg of five patients with unilateral ulcers, and the leg of six normal individuals. These values were also compared to TcPO2 measurements at the chest. Our results indicate that, whereas TcPO2 values in limbs affected by venous ulcers are much lower than normal, there is a great deal of variability in oxygen diffusion around individual ulcers. These findings may represent a heterogeneity in the disease process affecting the leg.\r"

While it has been shown that UVB radiation is related to carcinogenesis of both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, it has not definitively been shown that stratospheric ozone depletion is translating into increased penetrating ultraviolet radiation. Estimates of increasing skin cancer in the future are dependent on calculations of UVB increases drawn from data on ozone depletion. The present article describes the history of stratospheric ozone depletion, how it may affect UVB penetration and skin cancer rates, and what is currently being done to prevent man's further detrimental effects on our atmosphere.\r"

While small- or medium-sized penile excisions heal very well by second intention, large areas of involvement are often grafted to prevent debilitating contractures. We report a case of near circumferential penile Bowen's disease treated by two separate operations that healed by second intention with very good cosmetic and functional results.\r"

The laser gave good or excellent reduction of telangiectasia and erythema and overall appearance in 24 of the patients with between one and three treatments. In addition, papule and pustule activity was decreased in 59.2% of the patients, with those with the most severe pre-treatment activity having the most significant improvement.

Accuracy of the mother's report was compared for nutrients and foods with dietary intake recorded by an observer. Neither socioeconomic status nor amount of time mother and child were together were related to any of the nutrient indicators of accuracy. Although socioeconomic status and amount of time mother and child were together were not related to the indicators of food accuracy, only 64.8% agreement was obtained between mothers and observers on foods consumed. Mothers were more likely to underreport (17.7%) than overreport (10.4%) foods. The low mean difference scores for nutrient indicators supported the use of the 24-hour recall method when collecting group data. The substantial disagreement on foods, however, suggests that previous studies assessing agreement on nutrients have overestimated the accuracy of the 24-hour recall method.\r"

Approximately 10% of the children either were unable to specify a value for weight, height, or both or reported values of a magnitude indicating that they could not quantitatively conceptualize these measurements. Of the remaining 90%, both boys and girls tended to underreport their weight. Underreporting weight was more pronounced among girls than among boys; for both sexes, the degree of underreporting was much greater among taller, heavier children than among shorter, lighter children. Deviation between self-reported and measured height was substantial for many individuals, but there was no consistent trend toward underreporting or overreporting. These findings indicate that children's self-reported weight data may have a systematic bias, particularly if a large proportion of the sample is over-weight; height data may have considerable random error. We, therefore, conclude that self-reported weights and heights of children may be subject to errors that could confound results if used in clinical or research efforts.\r"

Personal interview elicited medical history, drug usage, dietary information, height, and weight from 25 reference women (50 through 64 years old), 28 young-old women (65 through 84 years old), and 12 old-old women (85 through 92 years old). Blood samples were obtained from fasting participants and analyzed for total serum cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, serum triglyceride, serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM), serum albumin, and total serum protein. Serum lipids were not significantly affected by age, drug use, or age-by-drug use interaction. Effects of age were observed for IgA and serum albumin. Mean concentrations of serum immunoglobulins, serum albumin, and total serum proteins were within normal limits for all participants. Based on this small sample of rural older women, our results indicate that the normal levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and the healthy life-styles of these women may help offset any possible negative effects of elevated serum cholesterol concentrations.\r"

At the time of the earlier study, saccharin was the only available HIS; the current investigation considered the use of both saccharin and aspartame. Both studies used 24-hour recalls and food frequency data to assess the use of HISs and to determine intakes of sugars, energy, and selected dietary components. In this study 61% (82 of 135) of the women and 31% (18 of 58) of the men used HISs regularly. Among the women using HISs, sugar intake was significantly lower than among the women not using HISs, but both groups reported consuming a high proportion of energy from sugars. Among the men, use of HISs was associated with a significantly greater intake of sugars. The difference in the pattern of use between men and women is attributed to differences in concerns about weight and dieting. Compared with the earlier study, this investigation found a higher incidence of HIS use by both sexes and more use by men. Unlike the earlier findings, HIS use was not accompanied by a general restriction of food intake. There was no evidence that HISs were associated with a biologically significant reduction in sugar intake.\r"

The 50 best items, judged on the basis of item-analysis data and adherence to the table of specification, were selected for the final form of the inventory control system achievement test. The 50-item test was reliable as indicated by a Kuder-Richardson 20 value of .84.

We discuss the way public sector nutritionists spent their time and the health conditions of the clients they saw. Analysis reveals both positive and negative factors associated with block grant support of nutrition services. Block grants have afforded some local agencies the needed flexibility to hire nutritionists. Moreover, distributions of clients by demographic characteristics and diagnoses clearly reveal that the nutrition services reached their intended targets, among them several groups that were not likely to have been reached any other way. Especially noteworthy were the limited services provided to the homebound. On the other hand, because the funding was narrowly applied in the case of Maternal and Child Health Block Grants and was of very limited size in the case of Prevention Block Grants, needy groups continue to be missed. These include adolescent and adult males and the developmentally disabled. A final section of our analysis examines the average time spent by nutritionists per client visit. These results are presented in the context of service delivery and diagnostic categories. We conclude that use of block grant funding can add flexibility in meeting the need for nutrition services, but that it is restricted in scope.\r"

  ".W": "In three different murine models of bone marrow (BM) transplantation the capacity of asialo GM1+ cells to suppress graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) was investigated. In a first model, total lymphoid irradiation (TLI)-treated BALB/C mice were given 1 mg of anti-asialo GM1 antibody. This led to the disappearance of functional suppressor cells after TLI. Injections of anti-asialo GM1 into TLI-treated BALB/C mice before infusion of 30 x 10(6) fully allogeneic (C3H) BM cells, led to a significantly decreased survival rate as compared to TLI-treated mice injected with control serum before BM transplantation (survival 29 and 83%, respectively, at 120 days after transplantation, p = 0.0032 log rank). The mortality of the former group was due to GVHD as 1 degree all dying animals showed clinical and histologic signs of GVHD, 2 degrees all animals were chimeric and 3 degrees mice receiving no or syngeneic BALB/C BM had excellent survival rates excluding BM aplasia or increased susceptibility for infections as reason for the mortality of the allogeneic BM recipients. In a second model, asialo GM1+ cells were removed in vitro from the C3H BM inoculum before injection into lethally irradiated (9 Gy) BALB/C recipients. In mice kept in specific pathogen-free conditions, this procedure resulted into a significant mortality (12/12) as compared to mice receiving BM pretreated with control serum (1/12, p = 0.0001 log rank). When kept in conventional housing, GVHD occurred in both groups but much earlier in the group receiving anti-asialo GM1-treated BM (median survival time 6 vs 46 days for the control mice, p = 0.001 log rank). No animal receiving anti-asialo GM1 and treated with syngeneic BM died, thus excluding toxicity, increased susceptibility to infections, or decreased graft take as a cause of mortality. In a last model, asialo GM1 cells were removed from syngeneic BM in a BM transplantation model in which T cell-depleted syngeneic (BALB/C) and non-T cell-depleted allogeneic (C3H) BM was administered to lethally irradiated (9 Gy) BALB/C mice. Also in this model GVHD-related mortality only occurred in the group of mice receiving syngeneic BM from which asialo GM+ cells were depleted before infusion (3/12). Our experiments thus clearly show that asialo GM1+ cells from both recipient (the TLI model) as well as donor origin (the TBI experiments) can suppress the occurrence of GVHD.\r"

  ".W": "In secondary antibody (Ab) responses, Ag processing and presentation occur in secondary lymphoid organs but most serum Ab is produced by cells in the bone marrow. Plasma cells in the bone marrow are derived from B cells activated by Ag in secondary lymphoid organs. We hypothesized that germinal center (GC) B cells, which acquire Ag from follicular dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes during the first few days of the secondary response, migrate to the bone marrow to terminally differentiate and produce specific Ab. To test this we looked for GC B cells in the thoracic duct lymph and in peripheral blood after secondary challenge using the peanut agglutininhi phenotype and blast cell morphology as markers for GC B cells. In addition, GC B cells were injected i.v. into naive recipients to determine if they would home to the bone marrow. Finally, to determine if the bone marrow environment supports maturation and Ab production by GC B cells, we cocultured GC B cells with bone marrow cells or bone marrow supernatants. The results indicate that blast cells bearing the GC B cell phenotype were present in both the thoracic duct and the peripheral blood 3 days after antigenic challenge. Day 3 peripheral blood cells secreted specific Ab, whereas cells isolated on day 0, 8, or 11 did not. Furthermore, in adoptive transfer experiments, only the day 3 GC B cells produced specific Ab and migrated to the bone marrow of naive mice. Finally, either bone marrow cells or factor(s) produced by bone marrow cells markedly enhanced Ab production by day 3 GC B cells. These data support the hypothesis that during the first few days after secondary challenge GC B cells seed the bone marrow and differentiate into plasma cells which produce the large quantities of Ab typical of secondary responses.\r"

  ".U": "91250693\r", 
  ".W": "The CD59 Ag is a 20-kDa protein that is widely expressed on most leukocytes and RBC, is coupled to the membrane by a phosphatidylinositol-glycan anchoring structure, plays a role in cell interaction between monocytes and T cells, and also functions as an inhibitor of cytolysis by the terminal C components C5b-9. Because this molecule is structurally related to the murine Ly-6 family of Ag, we have investigated whether anti-CD59 mAb might be capable of activating human T lymphocytes in a manner similar to that described for antibodies to the murine Ly-6 Ag. In the presence of the appropriate co-stimulators, mAb to one of the two epitopes on CD59 were capable of inducing both a rise in intracytoplasmic free Ca2+, inositol phosphate production, IL-2 production, and T cell proliferation. Anti-CD59-induced inositol phosphate turnover and IL-2 production were dependent on co-expression of the CD3/TCR complex. CD59-loss mutants of the Jurkat cell line were completely responsive to stimulation by anti-CD3 thereby demonstrating that CD59 does not play a role as a signal transducer downstream from the TCR. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the CD59 Ag can play multiple distinct roles in the regulation of the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Newly generating memory B cells rapidly accumulate somatic mutations that can alter their Ag-combining sites and potentially engender recognition of self determinants. To investigate the possibility that, during their emergence secondary B cells pass through a window of tolerance susceptibility, we have examined the in vitro generation of memory B cells in the presence or absence of tolerogen. The findings indicate that, before antigenic stimulation, precursors to memory B cells are resistant to tolerance induction. However, 2 to 7 days after T cell-dependent antigenic stimulation, newly emerging hapten-specific secondary B cells can be inactivated by the presence of hapten on a carrier not recognized by available Th cells. This inactivation can be blocked by the presence of free hapten and can be competed by the presence of immunogen. Inactivation of newly generating secondary B cells appears less specific than the tolerance induction of immature neonatal or bone marrow B cells because inactivation can be accomplished by cross-reactive determinants. Interestingly, the presence of tolerogen after primary stimulation did not preclude the generation of cells responsive to a third in vitro stimulation. Therefore, whereas newly emerging memory B cells are highly susceptible to inactivation, the progression of the clones of progenitors to memory B cells appears resistant to tolerance induction.\r"

The adjuvant effect of colchicine was observed when the drug and Ag were injected in soluble form, i.e., no vehicle (e.g., oil, liposome) was necessary.

  ".U": "91250697\r", 
  ".W": "We have investigated the effect of the avidity of a monoclonal anti-mouse IgM antibody (mAb) on its ability to activate normal B cells vs its capacity to inhibit the growth of an immature B lymphoma, BKS-2. A panel of seven mAb with specificities for four different domains of mu-heavy chain were selected and their relative avidities measured. Of the seven mAb studied, four antibodies (b7-6, Ak11, AK15, and DS1) were found to have relatively higher avidities than three others (AK17, 331.12, and Bet-2). Among them, the mAb b7-6 was highly efficient in inducing proliferation of normal B cells, whereas all others (including the remaining three high avidity mAb) were inefficient in inducing B cell proliferation. This failure cannot be simply related to the differences in their fine specificity because all the mAb became highly stimulatory after coupling to Sepharose beads. With one exception (DS1), avidity was a better predictor of the growth-stimulatory capacity when the antibodies were immobilized. Taken together, these findings suggested that although high affinity was important, there were other factors that might influence the mitogenic potential of a soluble anti-mu mAb. On the other hand, all anti-mu mAb irrespective of their avidity, fine specificity, and isotype were capable of effectively inhibiting the growth of BKS-2 cells. Furthermore, there was a direct correlation between the avidity and the dose of the mAb required to cause half-maximal inhibition of BKS-2 growth. The F(ab) fragments of high avidity mAb b7-6 failed to inhibit the growth of BKS-2 cells, which indicates that a minimal level of cross-linking of the membrane Ig receptor is necessary for causing growth inhibition in BKS-2 cells. Although there was no significant difference in the tolerogenic potential of soluble vs immobilized anti-mu mAb in directly inactivating BKS-2 cells, their growth-inhibitory capacity was remarkably different in the presence of rIL-5. Thus, rIL-5 was effective in partially overcoming the tolerogenic effect of soluble but not immobilized anti-mu mAb. Unlike IL-5, LPS rescued BKS-2 cells from the inhibitory effect of both soluble and immobilized anti-mu antibodies. Altogether, these results suggested that the ligand binding requisites for tolerance induction were less stringent than those for B cell activation. Furthermore, a high affinity interaction between membrane Ig receptor and its ligand appeared to generate a dominant negative signal that was not reversed by lymphokines.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether native bovine type XI collagen (BXI) is arthritogenic, five strains of inbred mice were immunized with BXI/CFA. Arthritis was not observed in any of these strains, though it was prevalent in DBA/1 and B10.RIII controls immunized with bovine type II collagen (BII). Antisera from BXI-immunized mice reacted with mouse type XI collagen (MsXI), weakly with the alpha-chains of BXI, and minimally with mouse type II collagen (MsII). However, antisera to BII reacted with MsII and MsXI, indicating antibodies to conformation-independent epitopes shared by alpha 1(II) and alpha 3(XI). Mice immunized with BXI containing a small amount of BII developed arthritis much like those immunized with BII; sera from these mice reacted with MsXI and MsII. Delayed-type hypersensitivity responses differed from IgG responses, i.e., BXI elicited responses to alpha 1(XI), alpha 2(XI), alpha 3(XI), and alpha 1(II); BII, to alpha 3(XI) and alpha 1(II) exclusively. To determine whether alpha 1(XI), alpha 2(XI), alpha 3(XI), and alpha 1(II) are arthritogenic, DBA/1J mice were immunized with each alpha-chain. Arthritis was seen in mice injected with alpha 3(XI) or alpha 1(II). Sera to both alpha-chains reacted similarly with MsII and peptide fragment alpha 1(II)-CB11. Epitope mapping using polyclonal and mAb to type II collagen revealed that all polyclonal and 11 of 14 mAb reacted with alpha 3(XI) and alpha 1(II), whereas three mAb reacted only with alpha 1(II). In conclusion, BXI is immunogenic but not arthritogenic in five strains of mice, whereas alpha 3(XI) and alpha 1(II) are arthritogenic and immunogenic in DBA/1 mice and share greater than or equal to 11 epitopes recognized by autoantibody.\r"

The ability of these clones to bind to and migrate through monolayers of EC in vitro was compared with that of clones generated in a similar manner from normal controls. The LAD clones bound to EC to a similar extent as the controls. The contribution of other cell surface adhesion molecules was assessed with mAb blocking experiments. It was found that part of the EC binding by these CD11a/CD18-deficient clones was mediated by an interaction of very late Ag-4 (VLA-4) with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on the EC. In contrast to their normal ability to bind to EC, the capacity of the LAD clones to migrate through EC monolayers was significantly less than that of the control clones. This impairment in migration was not related to decreased intrinsic motility. Moreover, neither phorbol ester stimulation of the LAD clones nor IL-1 stimulation of the EC increased the capacity of the clones to migrate through EC monolayers, although binding to EC was augmented by both treatments. Only a minimal percentage of the migration of either control or LAD clones was inhibited by mAb to VLA-4 or VCAM-1. These data demonstrate that LFA-1 plays a central role in the transendothelial migration of T cells. In the absence of LFA-1, T cells retain the ability to bind to EC because of the activity of other receptor/ligand pairs, including VLA-4/VCAM-1. Finally, it is likely that, during both binding and transendothelial migration of T cells, additional cell surface molecules play a role.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating maternal T lymphocytes were noted in the peripheral blood of six patients with severe combined immunodeficiency. Phenotypical analyses revealed the presence of both CD4 and CD8 subsets in some but not all cases. The maternal T cells could be stimulated by anti-TCR/CD3 mAb +/- rIL-2, but were virtually silent in the MLR and against the recall Ag purified protein derivative of tuberculin and tetanus toxoid, even in immunized patients engrafted with T cells from a responding mother. Using a panel of mAb against TCR V region gene encoded epitopes including V beta 5, V beta 6, V beta 8, V beta 12, and V alpha 2, we show that maternal T cells displayed a profoundly reduced TCR diversity, characterized by a lack of one or even several TCR V subsets in all six cases and a dramatic (5- to 25-fold) expansion of other TCR V subsets in three cases. In one patient analyzed, limited TCR diversity was also seen in T cells cultured from bone marrow and skin; restimulation experiments of these cells against cells expressing host MHC Ag were unsuccessful, as were attempts to exclusively allocate anti-host proliferative responses of maternal control T cells to the TCR V subsets that had undergone expansion in vivo. We conclude that a severely reduced TCR diversity is a common feature of maternal T cells engrafted in severe combined immunodeficiency patients. These novel findings provide a structural basis to understand the failure of these cells to protect the host from infections and may also help to understand their relative inefficiency to induce lethal, multi-organ, graft vs host disease. Moreover, as an experiment of nature, the reported phenomenon clearly illustrates the functional consequences in vivo of an insufficient TCR diversity.\r"

Of particular interest, residues 55 to 69 of guinea pig basic protein could induce protection against EAE. A nonencephalitogenic T cell clone, C455-69, that was specific for this epitope transferred protection against both active and passive EAE. Clone C4 was found to express V beta 8.6 in its Ag receptor, and residues 39 to 59 of the TCR V beta 8.6 sequence were found to be highly crossreactive with the corresponding residues 39 to 59 of TCR V beta 8.2, which is known to induce protective anti-idiotypic T cells and antibodies. Like the TCR V beta 8.2 peptide, the V beta 8.6 sequence induced autoregulation and provided effective treatment of established EAE. Thus, the EAE-protective effect of the guinea pig basic protein 55-69 sequence was most likely mediated by T cell clones such as C4 that could efficiently induce anti-TCR immunity directed at a cross-reactive regulatory idiotope.\r"

  ".W": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice can be transplanted successfully with human fetal liver and thymus (SCID-hu mice). Precursor cells derived from the fetal liver differentiate in the thymus and migrate into the blood as mature T cells. In the present paper, the peripheral T cell compartment of such mice was studied. Peripheral WBC were activated by PHA and cultured in the presence of irradiated human feeder cells. The resultant cell population consisted exclusively of human CD1- CD2+ CD3+ CD7+ T lymphocytes; up to 4% of the T cells expressed the TCR gamma delta, whereas 95 to 100% were TCR alpha beta +. The CD4bright (42 to 66%) and CD8bright (30 to 54%) populations coexpressed variable but low levels of CD8 and CD4, respectively. The T cell cultures from the SCID-hu mice did not display reactivity towards the autologous human EBV-transformed B cell lines (B-LCL). On the other hand, these human T cells proliferated and were cytotoxic against allogeneic human B-LCL. T cell clones were established from cultured SCID-hu T cells. All T cell clones were TCR alpha beta + CD3+ CD2+; 61% of the clones were CD4+ CD8-, 27% were CD8+ CD4-, 11% were CD8+ CD4lo, and 2% were CD4+ CD8lo. None of these clones recognized the autologous B-LCL established from the fetal human donor. Fourteen of 100 T cell clones had specific alloreactivity, as tested on a panel of five B-LCL. Of these 14, two CD8+ CD4lo and two CD8+ CD4- clones were cytotoxic and did not proliferate in response to specific stimulator cells. Furthermore, two CD4+ CD8lo and eight CD4+ CD8- clones proliferated specifically in response to alloantigens. In conclusion, the peripheral human T cells of SCID-hu animals are functional and their TCR repertoire is polyclonal, alloreactive, and devoid of self-reactive cells. Therefore, the SCID-hu mouse can be a suitable model for the study of alloreactivity and allotolerance in vivo, as well as for the study of negative selection in the human thymus.\r"

  ".U": "91250704\r", 
  ".W": "Previous in vitro studies suggest that recognition of phosphomannosyl structures by lymphocytes plays a central role in the binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules. However, the physiologic relevance of phosphomannosyl recognition in in vivo lymphocyte migration has not been established. This paper describes experiments that examined this question. It was demonstrated that the phosphomannan monoester core (PPME) from Pichia holstii, a potent inhibitor of peripheral node high endothelial venule interactions in vitro, was a very effective inhibitor of in vivo lymphocyte migration, as little as 39 micrograms/mouse significantly inhibiting popliteal lymph node entry. Furthermore, PPME exhibited a similar hierarchy of inhibition in vivo as previously reported in vitro, most effectively inhibiting entry of lymphocytes into popliteal lymph node, somewhat less effectively inhibiting mesenteric lymph node entry and being a relatively poor inhibitor of Peyer's patch entry. Additionally, PPME inhibited splenic entry of lymphocytes, and inhibition of lymphoid organ entry was accompanied by a substantial leukocytosis. Two additional mannose-containing compounds were found to modify lymphocyte migration, namely a well defined mannose containing pentasaccharide (PENT) with terminal mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) and an unphosphorylated yeast mannan. Both PENT and mannan induced leukocytosis and were particularly effective at inhibiting splenic entry of lymphocytes. In fact, detailed dose-response curves indicated that mannan was a much more potent inhibitor of splenic entry than PPME or PENT, whereas in lymph nodes PPME was the most effective inhibitor. Pretreatment of lymphocytes before injection with either PPME or mannan demonstrated that PPME could act at the lymphocyte level, whereas mannan probably acted at some other site. Collectively, these data suggest that different carbohydrate structures are involved in the entry of lymphocytes into different lymphoid organs, with mannose recognition playing an important role in splenic entry and recognition of M6P-like structures controlling lymph node entry. In contrast, it was found that mannose-and M6P-containing structures, unlike sulfated polysaccharides such as fucoidan, did not affect the subsequent positioning of lymphocytes within lymphoid organs.\r"

  ".W": "IL-1 has been shown to induce granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF production in several cell types including T lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. We have previously demonstrated that bacterial LPS activates expression of the GM-CSF gene in murine B lymphocytes. Inasmuch as LPS is also an inducer of IL-1, we asked whether IL-1 could itself induce GM-CSF gene expression in B lymphocytes. The GM-CSF-dependent PT-18 cell line was used to detect GM-CSF biologic activity and a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was developed to detect and measure GM-CSF mRNA. IL-1 alpha stimulated GM-CSF production by the murine B cell lines M12.4.1 and TH2.2 but not by the M12 line in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. GM-CSF mRNA expression in IL-1 alpha-treated M12.4.1 cells also increased in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Nuclear run-on transcription assays revealed constitutive transcription of the GM-CSF gene in untreated M12.4.1 cells that did not change after IL-1 alpha treatment. Actinomycin D chase experiments indicated that IL-1 alpha increased GM-CSF mRNA stability in the M12.4.1 cells. These findings indicate that IL-1 alpha induces GM-CSF gene expression in murine B cell lines and that this event is posttranscriptionally controlled mainly at the level of mRNA stabilization.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of IL-5R expression in normal, non-Ly-1 (CD5) B cells was evaluated. Freshly isolated unfractionated spleen B cells express little or no detectable IL-5R. In contrast, B cells stimulated with anti-Ig-dextran conjugates express substantial numbers of IL-5R. Phenotypic analysis of the B cells responding to anti-Ig-dextran, and expressing IL-5R, demonstrates that these cells do not express Ly-1 or Mac-1. Scatchard analysis of B cells stimulated with anti-IgD-dextran reveals two classes of IL-5R: a high affinity receptor with a Kd of 17 pM and approximately 300 receptors/cell, and a low affinity receptor with a Kd of 0.6 nM and approximately 1000 receptors/cell. Peak receptor expression in response to anti-IgD-dextran is seen 72 h after stimulation and with a dose of 10 ng/ml. The induced receptors are functional, because both proliferation and Ig secretion by B cells treated with anti-IgD-dextran are enhanced by IL-5. Other B cell mitogens such as LPS, soluble anti-Ig/IL-4, or phorbol esters/ionomycin are poor inducers of the IL-5R. Finally, not only does LPS fail to induce significant IL-5R expression on spleen B cells, it suppresses both high and low affinity IL-5R expression induced by anti-IgD-dextran. These data indicate that normal, non-Ly-1 B cells are capable of expressing both high and low affinity IL-5R but that receptor expression is critically dependent on the type of stimulus provided to the B cell. A stimulus that produces extensive cross-linking of surface Ig on B cells, i.e., anti-Ig-dextran, is very effective in inducing IL-5R whereas a variety of other B cell mitogens are ineffective.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if in vivo administration of granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) affects production of B lymphocytes in the bone marrow, mice were treated with the cytokine and the kinetics of B cell production was analyzed. After 1 wk of GM-CSF treatment, the number of B cell progenitors that express the B220 Ag had fallen fivefold and surface IgM expressing B cells were barely detectable. Although cellularity in the spleen had increased two-fold, due in part to an increase in the number of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells, splenic B cell levels were not affected by the GM-CSF treatment. Although numbers of marrow B cells and their immediate progenitors declined due to cytokine treatment, cells capable of rapidly restoring B lymphopoiesis were present in that tissue. After cessation of GM-CSF treatment, B lymphopoiesis resumed in the marrow of the mice and rebounded to supernormal levels at 1 wk after the last GM-CSF injection. This effect may be due to actions of GM-CSF on the B lymphopoietic support capability of the marrow environment, because the overproduction of B cells was not observed when marrow from the GM-CSF donors was used to reconstitute sublethally irradiated severe combined immunodeficient mice.\r"

To further define the role of IL-4 in the generation of memory IgE responses, we investigated the ability of a combination of anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-4R mAb to block the generation of secondary IgE responses induced by: 1) a second infection with the nematode parasites Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or Heligmosomoides polygyrus; or 2) injection of anti-IgD antibody-primed mice with anti-IgE antibody. The latter stimulus was designed to induce intrinsic membrane IgE-expressing B cells to differentiate into IgE-secreting cells. Although the IgE responses induced by a second nematode infection were completely inhibited by the combination of anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-4R mAb, anti-IgE antibody-induced IgE responses in anti-IgD primed mice were not inhibited by these antibodies to a large degree. Additional experiments demonstrated that the anti-IgE antibody-induced memory IgE response was dependent on CD4+ T cells but did not involve the low affinity B cell Fc epsilon RII. Taken together, these observations provide evidence that IL-4 is required for virgin B lymphocytes to develop into IgE-expressing cells, but is not required for B cells that express intrinsic membrane IgE to differentiate into IgE-secreting cells in a T-dependent response. Furthermore, these data suggest that secondary IgE responses in the parasite models that we have studied develop from B cells that had not previously switched to the expression of IgE.\r"

In this report, we show that IL-2- and IL-4-dependent DNA synthesis of anti-mu-activated human B cells is modulated in opposite ways by agents increasing intracellular levels of cAMP. Forskolin and 2'-O-dibutyriladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate had no proliferative effect by themselves. Nevertheless they decreased IL-2-driven proliferation and increased IL-4-mediated DNA synthesis. IL-4 and cAMP each inhibited the IL-2-dependent proliferation with similar patterns of reactivity. Both IL-4 and forskolin needed to be present during the first 48 h of culture to display inhibitory activity, and preactivation of B cells for 16 h with forskolin and IL-4 did not prevent further B cell response to IL-2. This suggests that cAMP and IL-4 directly interact with IL-2 signaling. In addition, we show that the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor N-(2-methylamino-ethyl)-5-iso-quinoline-sulfamide reversed the IL-4-inhibitory effect on IL-2-driven proliferation. Our data suggest that the IL-4-inhibitory signal to IL-2-driven human B cell proliferation involves cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation.\r"

Mouse IL-1rn mRNA may be induced in P388D1 monocytic cells with PMA and in mouse liver in vivo by development of an experimental inflammation via s.c. injection of azocasein. This latter observation implies the existence of an autocrine hepatic negative feedback loop that down-regulates the acute phase response and is itself induced at the same time as the major acute-phase proteins. The mouse Il 1rn gene was mapped to the proximal region of chromosome 2 between the centromere and Spna2; the other known members of the mouse IL-1 gene family, Il 1a and Il 1b, both map to the same chromosome, although not in close linkage.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the complement-activating properties of liposomes. We show that surface charge is a key determinant of complement-activating liposomes. The nature of the charge, whether negative or positive, appears to dictate which pathway of the complement system is activated. Phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol (PC:CHOL, 55:45 mol/mol) liposomes were made to exhibit a positive or negative surface charge by the addition of cationic or anionic lipids, respectively. Normal human or guinea pig serum was incubated with liposomes, followed by determining the residual hemolytic activity of the serum as a measure of complement activation. Negatively charged liposomes containing phosphatidyl-glycerol, phosphatidic acid, cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidylserine activated complement in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner suggesting activation occurred via the classical pathway. Positively charged liposomes containing stearylamine or 1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3-(trimethylammonio)propane activated complement via the alternative pathway. Neutral liposomes, PC:CHOL (55:45) and PC:CHOL:dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (35:45:20), failed to activate complement as measured by the hemolytic assays. We show that unsaturated liposomes are more potent complement activators than saturated liposomes and that 45 mol% cholesterol promotes complement protein-liposome interactions. Immunoblot analysis of phosphatidylglycerol-containing liposomes showed that C3b and C9 were associated with these liposomes. Thus, the complement consumption measured in the hemolytic assays represents active cleavage of the complement components and not passive adsorption to the liposome surface. These studies suggest that membranes composed of net charged phospholipids can activate the complement system. This observation underlines the importance in biologic membranes of complement regulatory proteins that protect normal cells from complement attack.\r"

Each of the 13 substitutions significantly decreased or eliminated the ability of the DR7 molecule to present a peptide to one or more of the T cell clones, but none of the substitutions abolished recognition by all clones. Interestingly, substitutions at positions 4 and 25, which are predicted in the class II model to be located outside the peptide binding groove, decreased the ability of the DR7 molecule to present Ag to some clones but not to others. Each of the four clones specific for the p2 peptide and the two clones specific for peptide p30 had a different reactivity pattern to the panel of DR7 beta 1 mutants, indicating that the TCR of each clone has a different view of the p2/DR7 or p30/DR7 complex.

A three-dimensional model of the antimorphine-binding site was constructed by using computational and graphic display techniques. Each of the six complementary-determining regions was constructed by using fragment replacement methods employing canonical loop conformations of known \"parent\" structures. Experimental competitive ligand-binding data and theoretical modeling suggest that a charged glutamate residue at position H:50 and aromatic side chains of residues H:33W, H:47W, H:58F, H:95W, H:101iY, and L:91W are key features in ionic and hydrophobic interactions with the ligand.

Both by direct binding and by inhibition ELISA studies, the anti-idiotypic antibody was shown to react with a cross-reactive idiotope present on Fab fragments of most, but not all, tested anti-CII mAb, whereas the binding to Fab fragments from normal mouse IgG was low. As previously described, C1C3 bound to isolated Fc fragments from normal mouse IgG. The binding to intact normal mouse IgG was, however, weak, and only isolated Fc-gamma fragments, not intact IgG, competed efficiently with Fab fragments of anti-CII antibodies for binding to the antiidiotypic antibody. The antibody was shown to self-associate, i.e., to behave similarly to certain IgG rheumatoid factors obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The presented data indicate that the described anti-anti-CII mAb may be representative of antibodies involved in the physiologic regulation of autoimmunity to CII and, consequently, may be used as a tool for further studies on idiotypic regulation in CII-induced arthritis.\r"

Transfectants expressing mutant DR7 molecules were used as stimulators for six DR7-alloreactive T cell clones. The majority of the substitutions had profound effects on the ability of the DR7 molecule to stimulate one or more T cell clones. Nine of the 13 substitutions completely abrogated recognition by at least one clone. The finding that each of the substitutions in the beta-strands in the floor of the peptide binding groove affected T cell allorecognition supports the model of allorecognition in which the complex of a self-peptide bound to a class II molecule is recognized by the TCR. Interestingly, the substitution at position 4, which is predicted to be located outside the peptide binding groove, decreased the ability of the DR7 molecule to stimulate some clones. Each of the DR7-alloreactive T cell clones had a unique reactivity pattern in response to the different mutant molecules, indicating that the TCR of each clone recognized the DR7 molecule differently. Surprisingly, many of the mutant DR7 molecules induced proliferation by one or more clones that was greater than 125% of the proliferation induced by the wild-type DR7 molecule. These data indicate that multiple polymorphic residues, predicted in the class II model to be located in both the beta-strands and alpha-helix of the DR7 beta 1 chain, contribute to allorecognition of the DR7 molecule.\r"

It bound to two novel derivatives of ganglioside GD1b (Ag I and Ag II) that appear to be present only in rat mast cells. The present study demonstrates the importance of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II for binding of mAb AA4 to intact cells. We also investigated the presence of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II and proteins immunoprecipitated with mAb AA4 in the parental and four variant cell lines. In comparison with the parental RBL-2H3, two variant cell lines had very low (0.5% and 2.0%) and two others had intermediate levels (9% and 18%) of 125I-AA4 binding. mAb AA4 inhibited 125I-IgE binding to the parental RBL-2H3 cells and to only one variant with intermediate amounts of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II. Therefore, there are variations in the proximity of these gangliosides to the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) among different cell lines. mAb AA4 immunoprecipitated proteins of 50 to 60, 120, and 135 kDa from 125I-surface labeled cells. These were different from the subunits of Fc epsilon RI. The amount of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II in cell extracts correlated with the number of mAb AA4 binding sites on the cell surface and with the quantity of proteins precipitated from the different cell lines. Thus, these membrane proteins appear to be associated with gangliosides Ag I and Ag II. The binding of mAb AA4 to the surface gangliosides could induce intracellular changes through transmembrane signaling by these proteins.\r"

A significant rise in F-actin assembly was induced by addition of 5 micrograms/ml immune complex. Concentrations of immune complex of more than 200 micrograms/ml caused a maximal (approximately twofold) increase in F-actin content. After a delay of 5 s, the F-actin levels rose and reached maximum levels by 60 s after adding immune complexes. The twofold elevation in F-actin persisted for up to 60 min. Both anti-Fc gamma RII and anti-Fc gamma RIII mAb blocked immune complex stimulated actin polymerization. Exposure to pertussis toxin failed to affect the rate or extent of immune complex-induced actin polymerization. Cells incubated with immune complexes and then lysed with Triton had an increased number of sites able to nucleate actin polymerization. These findings suggest that immune complex binding to both polymorphonuclear leukocytes Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII is required for actin filament assembly and that the induction of assembly occurs via transduction pathways that differ from those used by chemoattractants. As with adhesion this phagocytic stimulus induces actin assembly by a pertussis toxin insensitive pathway and produces a rise in actin filament content that persists for prolonged periods of time.\r"

  ".W": "Monosodium urate crystals are believed to trigger acute inflammation via the direct stimulation of leukocytes. Unopsonized urate crystals activate neutrophil (PMN) membrane G proteins in a pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive manner, but induce PT-insensitive cytosolic [Ca2+]i elevation. Thus, we have further defined the mechanism of PMN responsiveness to urate crystals in this study. Though urate crystals can increase membrane permeability by lytic effects, we observed elevation of PMN cytosolic [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular [Ca2+]i. In addition, the early, crystal-induced cytosolic [Ca2+]i transient was buffered in cells loaded with a [Ca2+]i-chelator. This suggested mobilization of internal [Ca2+]i stores, which was supported by demonstrating rapid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis, and the formation of inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (as well as phosphatidic acid) in a PT-insensitive manner. Importantly, PMN activation by urate crystals was discriminatory, as evidenced by the absence of phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate formation, a PT-sensitive event triggered by chemotactic factors. Urate crystal-induced PIP2 hydrolysis was not a nonspecific consequence of the early cytosolic [Ca2+]i transient itself, and it did not require phagocytosis. However, crystal-induced O2- release was markedly inhibited by buffering of the early cytosolic [Ca2+]i transient under conditions where crystal phagocytosis and PMA-induced O2- release were unaffected. We conclude that urate crystals activate PT-insensitive PIP2 hydrolysis, resulting in IP3 generation, and early urate crystal-induced mobilization of cytosolic [Ca2+]i. This pathway appears to modulate crystal-induced O2- release.\r"

Maturation of probactenecins has been investigated by studying the effects of stimulus-induced degranulation on this process. Stimulation of neutrophils with PMA, which is a secretagogue for specific and large granules but not for azurophils, induces a substantial discharge of uncleaved probactenecins in the extracellular medium, as revealed by Western blot analysis. When neutrophils are exposed to opsonized bacteria in the presence of cytochalasin B, resulting in exocytosis of the content of azurophils in addition to that of specific and large granules, probactenecins are secreted and rapidly converted into the corresponding mature antimicrobial peptides. Such a conversion is prevented if serine proteases, stored in the azurophils, are inhibited by pretreatment of neutrophils with PMSF. Phagocytosis, while causing a rapid discharge of the contents of azurophil and of the large granules into phagocytic vacuoles, as indicated by immunogold electron microscopy, also induces cleavage of probactenecins into mature peptides, as revealed by Western blot analysis. We conclude that the final processing of the storage forms of bactenecins arises from their interaction with the serine protease(s) of azurophils during bacteria-induced degranulation of neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "A number of pneumococcal type 4 poly- and oligosaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugates were prepared using identical conjugation methods. Purified conjugates with similar m.w. were injected in mice; polysaccharide conjugates (PS4TT) were more immunogenic than oligosaccharide conjugates (OS4TT). Polysaccharide conjugates with a PS4:TT ratio less than 1 (w/w) appeared to be the most immunogenic conjugates. This was observed in both NIH (outbred) and BALB/c (inbred) strains of mice. Oligosaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugates required w/w ratios of greater than 1 to acquire optimal immunogenicity. Oligosaccharides (12 repeating units) of pneumococcal type 4, obtained by periodate cleavage, appeared to retain full antigenicity as measured by competition ELISA. Both PS4TT and OS4TT conjugates induced an antibody response with the characteristics of a T cell-dependent type of immune response. An anti-PS4 IgG and IgM booster effect could be demonstrated for all conjugates. The IgG subclass response induced by PS4TT and OS4TT conjugates is primarily IgG1 but IgG3 is also detectable. However, the amounts of anti-PS4 IgG3 differed for the various conjugates. We conclude that the immune response induced by pneumococcal type 4 saccharide tetanus toxoid conjugates can be manipulated by variation of the saccharide:protein ratio and the saccharide chain length, whereas keeping the m.w. of such conjugates at constant values.\r"

  ".W": "Six different anti-HIV envelope antibodies and one irrelevant control antibody were coupled to ricin A chain and tested for their efficacy in inhibiting HIV tissue culture infections. The anti-HIV antibodies consisted of five monoclonals, three of murine and two of human origin, and one polyclonal preparation prepared by affinity purifying pooled serum antibodies from HIV-infected humans on rgp160. The binding specificity of the antibodies was defined by ELISA by using recombinant envelope proteins and synthetic peptides, and by flow cytometry on HIV-infected cells. The in vitro efficacy of the antibodies was tested by the abilities of the immunotoxins to inhibit protein synthesis in persistently infected cell lines and by their abilities to inhibit HIV production during both acute and persistent infection as measured with an HIV-specific focal immunoassay. The immunotoxins were tested against a panel of distinctly different HIV isolates. The results indicate the following: 1) A mAb to the immunodominant neutralizing loop was highly effective against homologous strains of HIV, but had no activity against heterologous HIV. 2) The efficacy of anti-gp41 mAb varied depending upon the epitope recognized and possibly the affinity of binding to gp41. 3) The polyclonal human anti-gp160 antibodies produced the immunotoxin with the broadest specificity for different HIV strains and the greatest specific activity. This is related to the polyclonal nature of the preparation rather than an increase in relative avidity of the antibody. 4) Activity of an immunotoxin is not a direct function of the binding of the antibody to the surface of infected cells. 5) The ability of an immunotoxin to halt the spread of infection through a tissue culture cell population is dependent upon the ability of the antibody to neutralize the virus as well as the activity of the toxin. Our data suggest that efficacious immunotoxins for the treatment of AIDS may be made with polyclonal anti-envelope antibodies derived from the serum of patients who have been infected with HIV or with appropriately chosen anti-gp41 antibodies.\r"

F105 is an IgG1 kappa antibody that binds to the surfaces of cells infected with all HIV-1 strains tested: MN, RF, IIIB, and SF2, but not uninfected cells. The HmAb immunoprecipitates GP120 from all four strains. F105 does not react with denatured GP120 on Western blots, but does react with viral lysates and purified GP120 dotted onto nitrocellulose filter paper under nondenaturing conditions. rGP120 from SF2 and soluble rCD4 inhibit antibody binding to infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. F105 inhibits the binding of free, infectious virions to uninfected HT-H9 cells with 50% of maximal (100%) inhibition at approximately 1 microgram/ml. F105 inhibits infection of HT-H9 cells by 100 tissue culture infective dose 50% units of MN and IIIB strains with 50% inhibition at concentrations of HmAb readily achievable in man. It appears that the F105 HmAb reacts with a conformationally defined epitope on HIV-1/GP120 that is exposed on the free virion and is important for binding to the cell surface by the virion. The epitope, which is immunogenic in humans, appears to be within, or topographically near, the CD4-binding site. F105 and the F105 epitope are potentially useful in therapy and in the design of peptide or anti-Id based vaccines; monitoring of the expression of the Id may prove useful in evaluating immune responses in infected individuals or vaccinated volunteers.\r"

Northern blot and polymerase chain reaction analysis indicate that multiple rtFc gamma RIII alpha isoforms are expressed by rat NK and macrophages contrasting the expression of a single class III receptor isoform by human and mouse NK and macrophages. Analysis of genomic Southern blots and splice variants identified by polymerase chain reaction suggests the existence of several homologous rat Fc gamma RIII alpha genes organized similar to human and mouse class III receptor genes. All rat Fc gamma RIII alpha isoform protein sequences have conventional transmembrane insertion sequences containing the unique LFAVDTGL motif conserved in all other class III Fc gamma and Fc epsilon RI alpha receptor sequences. A model is proposed for the protein-protein interactions between this sequence and the transmembrane sequences of two heteroprotein subunits, Fc epsilon RI gamma and CD3 zeta, known to interact with human and mouse class III receptors. Rat NK, monocytes, and neutrophils were all found to express transcripts for both of these subunits, whereas rat macrophages express only Fc epsilon RI gamma subunit transcripts. Furthermore, the Fc epsilon RI gamma subunit was found to promote the cell surface expression of rtFc gamma RIII alpha isoforms in transfected COS cells.\r"

Many of the allelic types at the DRB1 locus predate the divergence of hominoids (5 million yr ago) and some (DR4, DR3, 5, 6) predate the divergence of Old world monkeys and hominoids (20 million yr ago). The DRB3 locus appears to have arisen before the divergence of hominoids on an ancestral DRB1 lineage. The DRB2 and DRB5 loci were generated more than 20 million yr ago and the DRB4 locus more than 5 million yr ago. The DRB2 locus, a pseudogene in humans, is polymorphic in the nonhuman primates.\r"

  ".U": "91250738\r", 
  ".W": "The therapeutic efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy of cancer has been shown to positively correlate with the dose of tumor-immune T cells transferred. Therefore, the success of this therapy is critically dependent on the ability to procure large numbers of functionally active T cells. Previous studies in animal models have shown that the limited therapeutic efficacy of a small number of immune T cells can be greatly enhanced by expansion of T cells in vitro to greater numbers before transfer in vivo. Optimal regimens for T cell expansion in vitro have generally employed the use of intermittent stimulation of the TCR with specific Ag followed by exogenous IL-2. The use of IL-2 alone does not provide for requisite episodic up-regulation of IL-2R. Stimulation of the invariant CD3 portion of the TCR/CD3 complex with antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3) represents an alternative method of up-regulating IL-2R and has been used to nonspecifically induce the growth of Ag-specific T cell lines and clones long-term in vitro with maintenance of function and specificity. The current study examined whether resting T cell populations containing small numbers of memory tumor-specific T cells could be rendered more effective in tumor therapy by nonspecific expansion in vitro with anti-CD3 plus IL-2. Spleens from C57BL/6 mice previously immunized to FBL-3, a syngeneic virus-induced leukemia, were nonspecifically stimulated with anti-CD3 plus IL-2. The resultant T cells were expanded in number, were nonlytic to FBL-3 but retained the ability to become lytic upon specific stimulation by FBL-3, and were effective in specific tumor therapy. The Ag-specific anti-tumor immune function declined on a per cell basis after each cycle of anti-CD3-induced T cell expansion. However, the approach resulted in a substantial increase in total T cell number and an overall net increase in the function of the effector T cell population. Thus, stimulation of tumor-immune T cell populations with anti-CD3 plus IL-2 represents a nonspecific method for expanding the number of specific effector T cells for cancer therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM/CD56) is a member of the Ig supergene family that has been shown to mediate homophilic binding. Several isoforms of N-CAM have been identified that are expressed preferentially in different tissues and stages of embryonic development. To examine the primary structure of N-CAM expressed in leukocytes, N-CAM cDNA were generated by polymerase chain reaction from RNA isolated from normal human NK cells and the KG1a hematopoietic leukemia cell line. The sequence of leukocyte-derived N-CAM cDNA was essentially identical with N-CAM cDNA from human neuroblastoma cells that encode the 140-kDa isoform of N-CAM. Inasmuch as N-CAM is preferentially expressed on human NK cells and a subset of T lymphocytes that mediate MHC-unrestricted cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we examined the potential role of N-CAM in cell-mediated cytotoxicity and heterotypic lymphocyte-tumor cell adhesion. N-CAM loss mutants were established from the human N-CAM+ KG1a leukemia cell line, and N-CAM cDNA was transfected into a human colon carcinoma cell line and murine L cells. Using this panel of mutants and transfectants, it was determined that expression of N-CAM on these target cells does not affect susceptibility to resting or IL-2-activated NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, expression of N-CAM in these transfectants failed to induce homotypic or heterotypic cellular adhesion. Collectively, these studies indicate that homophilic N-CAM interactions probably do not mediate a major role in the cytolytic interaction between NK cells and N-CAM+ tumor cell targets.\r"

Other proteins besides perforin are found in the cytoplasmic granules of effector lymphocytes, and these include a family of serine esterases. Ultrastructural immunogold labeling studies with antibodies against perforin and a serine esterase (MTSP-1, also known as granzyme A and SE-1) show that all the granules of LAK cells and a CTL cell line contain perforin and serine esterase. For both LAK cells and CTL, perforin has been located mostly in the fine granular matrix of the granules, whereas gold particles corresponding to serine esterase have been found in both the matrix and the cap regions of the granules. Results from double immunogold labeling indicate that perforin and serine esterase colocalize to the same granules.\r"

One third of the AOM episodes (18/57) could be related to viral RTI, as evidenced by significant increases in viral serum antibody activity. Treatment failure occurred in four AOM episodes where increases in serum viral antibody activity were noted. In three of these failures, antibiotic treatment was unsuccessful despite the bacterial strains not being resistant to the drug used. This suggests that concomitant viral infection may be a determinant of treatment outcome in some AOM episodes.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about the optimum level of iodine intake for iodine supplementation programmes, or about the effects of the high levels of iodine intake that are found in some countries. We compared the incidence of different types of hyperthyroidism in East-Jutland Denmark with a low average iodine intake but no endemic goitre, and the incidence in Iceland with a relatively high iodine intake. Hyperthyroidism was more common in East-Jutland than in Iceland, due to a much higher incidence of multinodular toxic goitre and also of single toxic adenoma. Most of the patients with these diseases were over 50 years of age. By contrast, the incidence of Graves' disease was significantly higher in Iceland than in East-Jutland. This difference was most marked in the younger age groups, in which hyperthyroidism was more than twice as common in Iceland as in East-Jutland. These results demonstrate that even mild iodine deficiency has a significant effect on population health, since it leads to a high incidence of autonomous thyroid nodules with hyperthyroidism in the elderly population. However, population iodine intake probably should not exceed a level much higher than that necessary to avoid iodine deficiency, otherwise Graves' disease may be induced in the young population.\r"

In FH patients the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduced 'light' LDL particles (density 1.022-1.033 g ml-1) significantly more than 'heavy' LDL (density 1.033-1.059 g ml-1), while a more uniform reduction of 'light' and 'heavy' LDL occurred in non-FH patients. HMG CoA reductase inhibitor treatment increased the apolipoprotein B (apoB) content and decreased the cholesterol/apoB ratio of LDL in FH patients. Gemfibrozil significantly reduced 'heavy' LDL but not the 'light' LDL fraction in both FH and non-FH patients, and the mean cholesteryl ester content of LDL increased, while the Tg content decreased, in both FH and non-FH patients. The results indicate that HMG CoA reductase inhibitor and gemfibrozil treatment have distinctly different effects on the physico-chemical properties of LDL, reflecting their different modes of action on lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

Chromogranin A + B in plasma was increased preoperatively in all patients, showed no significant increase during surgery, and normalized postoperatively. Neuropeptide Y, which alone can induce hypertension, was present in high levels in plasma from three patients preoperatively, increased further in four patients during surgery, and was postoperatively low in all patients. Fractionated plasma catecholamines were increased in five patients before surgery, increased in all patients during tumour dissection, and normalized postoperatively.

By using the 99th percentile of the normal value distribution as the cut-off point, the positive predictive value (PV+) was found to be 85% (95% CI 76-94) for MCA, and 71% (95% CI 61-81) for CA 15-3. When receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, the PV+ for CA 15-3 was increased to 82% (95% CI 72-92), using 60 U ml-1 as the cut-off point. With the exception of two patients who had a slightly elevated MCA, MCA and CA 15-3 identified the same patients with breast cancer. By combining a positive MCA or CA 15-3 with a negative CEA and CA 125, further improvement of the PV+ could be achieved; 100% (95% CI 91-100). We conclude that MCA and CA 15-3 may play a useful role in discrimination between patients with metastatic breast cancer and those with adenocarcinoma of other primary sites.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Family practice centers are important contributors to the financial viability of academic health centers, although they often are not the direct beneficiaries of their own labor. The greater time commitment and lower costs of most primary care creates significant financial hardships for departments of family medicine in university centers. This study describes the use of inpatient and outpatient health care services by new patients at a university family practice center. METHODS. A sample of 215 new adult enrollees at a university family practice center were examined for a 1-year period after their initial visit to the center. Total billings by the university hospital, specialty services, and the family practice center were tabulated by insurance type. RESULTS. Medicare patients generated the highest average charges (+2501 per patient per year); self-indemnity patients generated the lowest average charges (+301 per patient per year). The largest portion of health services charges was generated by the university hospital inpatient service, which was responsible for approximately 60 cents of every dollar billed to patients in this study. Conversely, the Family Medicine Department billings generated only 17% of the total charges. CONCLUSIONS. The findings of this study indicate that university-based family practice centers are significant contributors to the financial and educational base of the academic health center. If family medicine and associated primary care centers are forced to reduce their size or services because of financial difficulties, the impact will be felt by the university hospitals and by other specialty departments.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although in general, patients in the United States are now told if they have been diagnosed as having cancer, little information is available either about the way in which this is done or about patients' satisfaction with how they are told. METHODS. Thirty-two patients were interviewed who had been given a diagnosis of cancer; one half were being treated at a comprehensive cancer center and one half at a community hospital. The study instrument, presented in a semistructured interview conducted by psychosocial clinicians, included specific questions about the setting and the manner in which the patients were told, their reactions to the diagnosis, and their suggestions of how physicians should inform others who have to be informed of a similar diagnosis. RESULTS. All patients were told of their diagnosis by a physician; 84% of the time the diagnosis was given in person. Patients said that being told with hope, information, and caring, and with respect for their privacy and wishes to have a supportive person present were particularly helpful. Almost 40% of patients reported at the time of the interview that their hopes were directed toward remission and optimal quality of life rather than toward a cure. Four of the six patients whose conditions had initially been misdiagnosed described subsequent mistrust of information received from physicians. CONCLUSIONS. These findings confirm the importance of a physician providing hope for and fostering trust in patients to whom they are presenting the diagnosis of cancer. The results indicate that physicians' help in providing treatment information contributes more to hope than does cheerfulness or optimism, and that patients who have been given a misdiagnosis require special consideration in order to reestablish trust.\r"

Individuals who completed screening sigmoidoscopy were interviewed to learn about the physician-patient relationship, general knowledge of cancer, family experience with cancer, exposure to the media, and specific reasons why sigmoidoscopy was completed. RESULTS. Respondents reported that their physician's recommendation had a strong positive influence on their decision to have sigmoidoscopic screening, as did their family and personal experiences with cancer. In all cases, the patients stated that they would not have had a sigmoidoscopy without the recommendation of their physician. Respondents were little influenced by exposure to the media or by famous personalities. CONCLUSIONS. The importance of the physician's recommendation for the patient to have sigmoidoscopy and demonstration of concern with early cancer detection may represent the primary motivating factors in completion of screening sigmoidoscopy.\r"

Colposcopy for the detection of genital malignancy and disease associated with human papillomavirus, along with cytologic screening and histopathologic correlation, allows for intervention before the onset of invasive disease. Family physicians are interested in learning colposcopy, but there are few reports in the literature on the training of colposcopists. METHODS. A colposcopy curriculum for family physicians was designed with goals, objectives, and instructional strategies selected to enhance learning and quality assurance of the current principles of colposcopic evaluation. During the pilot project, a third-year resident studied a syllabus and reviewed slides, practiced performance skills, and observed colposcopies. After demonstrating competence, the resident evaluated patients with instructor supervision and feedback. RESULTS. Resident performance data from written test scores and a performance checklist indicated an excellent learning curve. High resident satisfaction was reported. Suggestions from expert reviewers were incorporated into the final curriculum product. The evaluation data indicated that, based on this pilot program, family practice residents can effectively learn colposcopy. CONCLUSIONS. Colposcopy is a highly technical skill that can be learned by family physicians through professional training. Competency in colposcopy can provide a new dimension to their practice in the diagnosis and treatment of female lower-genital-tract disease. This colposcopy curriculum is an initial effort in the identification of the content and process required to train family physicians in the use of this diagnostic procedure.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Enterobacter bacteremia in the community hospital, where nosocomial infections are not commonly studied. METHODS. The blood culture records of five community hospitals in the Dayton, Ohio, area were reviewed to find cases of Enterobacter bacteremia. The respective hospital charts were then reviewed. RESULTS. Seventy-five episodes of Enterobacter bacteremia were reviewed. Eighty percent (60) of the organisms were nosocomially acquired, and 20% (15) were community acquired. The median age of the patients was 64 years. In 39% (29) of the episodes, fever was not the primary manifestation. The mortality rate was 29% (22). In 30% of the cases, the portal of entry for the bacteremia was unknown. The most common known portals of entry were genitourinary, gastrointestinal or biliary, and peritoneal. The most common underlying disorders were malignancy, postoperative states, and diabetes mellitus. In 9% of the cases, no underlying disorder was detected. The organisms showed high sensitivity to chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, piperacillin sodium, and cefotaxime sodium. High degrees of resistance were shown to ampicillin, first-generation cephalosporins, and cefoxitin. Eighty-four percent (46) of the patients treated appropriately survived, and 55% (11) of the patients treated inappropriately died. CONCLUSIONS. Enterobacter bacteremia is most commonly nosocomially acquired and appears to be a problem in the community hospital. Appropriate therapy improves rates of patient survival.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. It is more difficult to conduct drug utilization reviews in ambulatory care settings than in inpatient care settings. This is true for several reasons: it is harder to identify outpatients who are receiving specific medications; often there is less evidence on which to base clinical standards for drug use; and it is more difficult to ensure patient compliance with drug therapy. METHODS. This article describes a drug utilization review system designed to operate in ambulatory care clinics. The system consists of (1) a computerized database for efficient identification of patients who receive prescriptions for a specific medication, (2) clinic-wide consensus guidelines, (3) reminders in the medical record, (4) regular chart audits, and (5) feedback to physicians. RESULTS. Experience in monitoring the use of serum theophylline assays illustrates how this system can be used in an ambulatory care clinic. According to guidelines adopted in our clinic, overuse of assays is not a problem. The system of physician reminders and chart audits can help prevent underuse. CONCLUSIONS. Despite the difficulties in conducting drug utilization reviews in the ambulatory setting, a system based on clinic-wide guidelines is feasible and should be an integral part of quality assurance programs.\r"

A population-based survey was conducted in 1987 as part of a community-oriented primary care project that sought to define and address the causes of and burden caused by increased cardiovascular disease in an economically depressed agricultural region of New York. All of the residents living in two towns in the region who were over 16 years of age and who lived in their homes year-round were surveyed. Demographic information was obtained from the participants, as well as information about previous cholesterol testing and their cardiovascular-risk knowledge and behaviors. The serum cholesterol of each participant was measured. RESULTS. Of the 557 households contacted, 508 (91%) households participated. A total of 1063 persons over 16 years of age were surveyed, and 973 (92%) were screened for cholesterol. Overall, 24% reported prior cholesterol testing. Logistic regression analysis identified several independent factors that were associated with a reduced likelihood of ever having had a cholesterol test. These factors included: (1) age under 45 years, (2) having less than 12 years of education, (3) having an income of less than $10,000, (4) not having health insurance, (5) not having visited a physician within the previous year, and (6) practicing three or more high-risk cardiovascular behaviors. The participants' cardiovascular knowledge made no independent contribution to having had their cholesterol levels tested. CONCLUSIONS. Many of the factors that prevent cholesterol testing are socially determined. The results of this study suggest that financial and social barriers are two of the major obstacles to residents of rural communities having their cholesterol levels tested.\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen million individuals in the United States take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) chronically for the relief of pain and inflammation caused by arthritis and related conditions. NSAIDs are valuable and in many cases essential to the management of arthritis pain. Long-term use of NSAIDs, however, can cause gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and potentially life-threatening ulcer complications. Factors such as older age (greater than or equal to 60 years), a history of peptic ulcer disease, concomitant corticosterid use, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and high dose or multiple NSAID therapy can increase the risk of GI damage and complications in the chronic NSAID user. Physician awareness of these risk factors is crucial so that the benefits and hazards of NSAID therapy in high-risk patients can be properly weighed. When the decision is made to prescribe NSAIDs, despite the presence of risk factors for NSAID-induced ulcers, patients should be closely monitored, and, in some cases, effective prophylaxis should be initiated. This is especially important since NSAID-induced gastrointestinal ulcers can be asymptomatic, causing serious ulcer complications without warning.\r"

All 39 patients had longitudinal intravenous glucose tolerance tests to determine the first-phase insulin response (FPIR). Insulin dependence has developed in 10 untreated subjects less than 18 years of age. Of the 10 subjects, insulin dependence developed in eight a mean of 4.6 months after their FPIR fell to less than 30 microU/ml and a mean of 14 months after it fell to less than 46 microU/ml. Nine of the untreated subjects had an FPIR less than 67 microU/ml on at least two occasions and became insulin dependent a mean of 19 months after the value first fell below this level (95% confidence limit = 66.4% to 100%). All but one of the 10 subjects in whom IDDM developed initially had islet-cell antibody levels of greater than 80 JDF units. Insulin autoantibody values at onset were available for 9 of the 10 subjects and were positive (greater than 39 nU/ml) in six. We conclude that the combination of positive results on two islet-cell antibody tests and two diminished FPIRs (less than 67 microU/ml) in subjects less than 18 years of age reliably predicts the onset of IDDM. These data should permit intervention studies to be planned.\r"

DESIGN: Cohort. SUBJECTS: Ninety-nine healthy fifth-grade students. INTERVENTIONS: Students wore an ABPM for 24 hours while recording their activities in diaries. Before and after the study period, each subject had three BPs simultaneously measured with the ABPM and a mercury manometer to assess the accuracy of the ABPM. An activity scale was retrospectively applied to diary entries to help explain the variety of BP patterns noted during data analysis. RESULTS: Systolic BPs obtained with the ABPM at the beginning and end of the study were slightly higher than those obtained with a mercury manometer; diastolic BPs were virtually identical. A circadian pattern of BPs was noted: mean systolic and diastolic BPs were higher during the day than at night. The BP patterns ranged from \"hypoactive\" (little baseline variation) to \"hyperactive\" (wide fluctuations with spikes to elevated BP ranges) during various activities. In general, higher BPs were noted at times of increased activity or emotional levels. CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory BP monitoring was well tolerated, and measurements were reproducible and accurate. The variety of BP measurements noted at different activity levels indicate that a child's activity should be considered during data analysis. As further experience is gained, the ABPM should prove helpful in diagnosis and management of hypertension in children.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between the treatment serum thyroxine level and intellectual development at 2 and 6 years was investigated in 46 Norwegian children with congenital hypothyroidism identified by neonatal screening. The level of serum thyroxine during the first 2 years was positively correlated with the Mental Development Index at 2 years of age (Bayley Scales of Infant Development) and the Verbal IQ at 6 years of age (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence). Children with a mean serum thyroxine level greater than 180 nmol/L (14 micrograms/dl) during the first year had a significantly higher Mental Development Index at 2 years and Verbal IQ at 6 years than children with serum thyroxine values less than 129 nmol/L (10 micrograms/dl). Boys had a lower Mental Development Index at 2 years of age than girls (86.9 vs 105.1; p less than 0.001) and a higher frequency of elevated serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone during the first year (p = 0.001). No signs of toxic effects of a high hormone level at the time of IQ assessment were detected. However, high serum levels of thyroxine at ages 2 to 4 years in girls were related to lower Performance IQ at age 6 years. The results demonstrate that the serum level of thyroxine is of importance in relation to intellectual development. Thyroxine levels above the upper reference range during the first 2 years were related to best intellectual development at 2 and 6 years.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a child with circulating anti-epithelial cell antibodies, autoimmune enteropathy with intestinal villous atrophy, and membranous glomerulonephritis. The patient had persistent diarrhea at 6 months of age, and a small bowel biopsy showed active enteritis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. When the patient was, 10 months of age, nephrotic syndrome developed because of membranous glomerulonephritis. Results of tests for circulating immune complexes were negative. Indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed a circulating antibody directed against renal epithelial cells. Circulating antibodies directed against normal small intestine epithelial cells were also detected by the immunoperoxidase technique. Western blot and immunoprecipitation identified a 55-kd antigen, in both small bowel and kidney, that reacted with an antibody in the patient's serum. High-dose prednisone therapy induced a clinical remission, resolution of the small bowel injury, and diminished serum anti-epithelial cell antibodies; after dose reduction, clinical relapse occurred with villous atrophy and reappearance of anti-epithelial cell antibodies. When the patient was 45 months of age, persistent diarrhea recurred despite intravenous administration of corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and total parenteral nutrition. Autoantibodies to a 55-kd epithelial cell protein are temporally related to the development of enteropathy and nephropathy. Study of similar patients is needed to determine the role of such antibodies in this disorder.\r"

In this study REE was assessed with open-circuit indirect calorimetry, and free-living 24-hour TEE with the heart rate method. Thirteen patients with CF, aged 8 to 24 years, with adequate nutritional status and moderately decreased pulmonary function, were studied. They were compared with 13 healthy control subjects matched for gender, age, height, and nutritional status. Resting energy expenditure was higher in patients with CF (1512 +/- 88 kcal/day) than in control subjects (1339 +/- 76 kcal/day; p less than 0.01), whereas free-living 24-hour TEE (2345 +/- 127 kcal/day and 2358 +/- 256 kcal/day, respectively) and net mechanical work efficiency of walking on a treadmill (20.4 +/- 0.7% and 19.8 +/- 0.6%, respectively) were similar. Respiratory quotient was higher in patients with CF than in control subjects at rest (0.834 +/- 0.009 vs 0.797 +/- 0.008; p less than 0.05), and tended to remain so during physical exercise, indicating a higher contribution of carbohydrate oxidation to energy expenditure. We conclude that in free living conditions, patients with CF can compensate for their increase in REE by a reduction in spontaneous physical activities or other yet undefined mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with end-stage renal disease may have abnormalities of growth and of gonadal and thyroid hormones, so we attempted to determine the mechanisms that may be involved in the altered thyroid function. We evaluated serum thyroid hormone levels, their changes immediately after hemodialysis, the serum thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotropin releasing hormone, and the circadian pattern of serum TSH in nine children with end-stage renal disease who were between 7 1/2 years and 17 years 1 month of age. Seven patients had been receiving hemodialysis for a median of 3.3 years; the other two were receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Four patients had low serum total thyroxine (T4) values, and all nine had low free T4 values. Mean concentrations of total T4, free T4, and total triiodothyronine (T3), which were significantly less than normal before hemodialysis, returned to normal levels immediately after dialysis. Postdialysis thyroid hormone increases did not correlate with the decrease in weight or the increase in hematocrit observed immediately after dialysis. All but one patient had basal TSH levels within the normal range. Three patients had a deficient TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone, and the TSH response was prolonged in all of them. The mean (+/- SD) nocturnal TSH surge was 50 +/- 68%. Five of the eight patients studied had a nocturnal TSH surge below the normal range (95% confidence limits 47% to 300%). Serum free T4 values correlated with the TSH nocturnal surge (r, 0.73; p less than 0.05). Our findings support the hypothesis that some patients with end-stage renal disease have central hypothyroidism.\r"

Further assessment of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in several patients with one of the two types of disease also provided no defined abnormality.

Fever persisted for 3 to 4 days in 73% of infants and for more than 5 days in 22%, followed by a rubella- or measles-like rash. The viremia was observed between the first day of fever (day 0) and day 4 of the disease. The number of infected cells per 10 million mononuclear cells was 3.45 +/- 1.00 (log10, mean +/- SD) on days 0 to 2, 3.30 +/- 1.14 on day 3, and 3.09 +/- 2.05 on day 4 of the disease. The number of infected cells on days 3 to 4 in infants with a febrile period longer than 4 days and free virus in plasma was significantly greater than that in infants with a febrile period of less than 3 days and without free virus in plasma. The amount of virus in blood on days 0 to 2 did not relate to the duration of fever, and that on days 0 to 4 did not relate to the presence or absence of diarrhea, bulging fontanelle, or bronchopneumonia. These findings suggest that the magnitude of the virus replication in infants with exanthem subitum is reflected in the severity of the disease.\r"

Mean (+/- SD) gestational age was 39.5 weeks +/- 1.4 for term infants and 34.3 weeks +/- 2.6 for preterm infants. On the basis of a semiobjective symptom scoring scale, term infants had more severe abstinence symptoms and more prominent central nervous system manifestations than preterm infants. The severity of abstinence symptoms correlated with maternal methadone dosage in both term and preterm infants. Maternal multiple drug abuse (e.g., heroin, cocaine) did not influence severity of abstinence symptoms in either group. More term infants (145/178) than preterm infants (20/34) required treatment for these symptoms (p less than 0.005). In 13 of 178 term infants, compared with 1 of 34 preterm infants, abstinence-related seizures developed. Peak severity occurred 1 to 2 days earlier in term than in preterm infants. A less severe abstinence syndrome in preterm infants may be due to (1) developmental immaturity of either dendritic ramifications, specific opiate receptors, or neurotransmitter function, or (2) reduced total drug exposure during the intrauterine period.\r"

Live births increased over time from an annual average of 48.7 in the first era (January 1977 to March 1982) to 64.6 in the second era (January 1985 to December 1987), largely from referrals of additional mothers with pregnancy complications. In the first era, 33.6% (86/256) of infants survived to 2 years; the survival rate improved significantly to 45.9% (89/194) in era 2. After adjustment for birth weight, the odds ratio for survival in era 2 versus era 1 was 1.39 (95% confidence interval = 1.12, 1.73; p less than 0.01). One known survivor in each era was not seen at 2 years of age. In the first era, 59.3% (51/86) of 2-year-old children were free of disability compared with 68.5% (61/89) in era 2 (NS), but the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales improved significantly, from 90.0 in era 1 to 98.0 in era 2. For infants weighing less than 800 gm at birth, not only did the 2-year survival rate improve, adjusted for birth weight (odds ratio = 1.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.06, 2.20; p less than 0.05), but there was also a significant reduction in neurologic disabilities in survivors (p = 0.03). For infants weighing 800 to 999 gm at birth, there was a significant improvement in the survival rate, adjusted for birth weight (odds ratio = 1.37; 95% confidence interval = 1.04, 1.79; p less than 0.05), but the rate of neurologic disabilities was unchanged. Increased survival in our tertiary maternity center was achieved without increasing the annual number of severely disabled 2-year-old survivors.\r"

Load-dependent and load-independent measures of cardiac performance and indexes of cerebral blood flow were measured. Infants in both groups had similar weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and inotropic support before ECMO. Shortening fraction was normal in both groups before ECMO (47 +/- 11% vs 49 +/- 10%; p greater than or equal to 0.05), decreased during ECMO (31 +/- 18% vs 39 +/- 12%; p greater than or equal to 0.05), and did not change after administration of hydralazine (31 +/- 12% vs 37 +/- 8%; p greater than or equal to 0.05). Cardiac output was normal in both groups before ECMO (176 +/- 71 vs 157 +/- 72 ml/kg per minute; p greater than or equal to 0.05), decreased during ECMO (120 +/- 80 vs 105 +/- 64 ml/kg per minute; p greater than or equal to 0.05), and did not change after hydralazine administration.

We therefore randomly assigned 20 small premature infants (birth weight less than or equal to 1250 gm) who were highly likely to require erythrocyte transfusions for anemia of prematurity to receive 6 weeks of treatment with either intravenously administered r-HuEPO (at a dose of 100 units/kg twice each week) or a placebo. Hematologic measurements, transfusion requirements, and growth were followed during therapy and for 6 months thereafter. Treated (EPO) and control babies did not differ with respect to weight, hematocrit, overall mean absolute reticulocyte count, calculated erythrocyte mass, or rate of growth. However, reticulocyte counts increased earlier in patients given r-HuEPO. Six of ten babies in the EPO group, and 8 of 10 assigned to the control group, received at least one erythrocyte transfusion during treatment. For all infants the amount of blood sampled for laboratory tests was strongly predictive of the volume of packed erythrocytes transfused (r = 0.890; p = 0.0001). Of nine infants who had less than 20 ml packed erythrocytes removed for laboratory tests, none of four given r-HuEPO received a transfusion, whereas three of five infants assigned to the placebo group received one. No toxic effects were attributable to r-HuEPO, and no significant changes in leukocyte or platelet counts occurred during treatment. Reticulocyte counts were correlated with simultaneous platelet counts and were inversely related to absolute neutrophil counts in both study groups. We conclude that r-HuEPO administration is safe and feasible at the dose studied. Additional controlled trials utilizing higher doses of r-HuEPO and larger numbers of patients are justified.\r"

  ".W": "Antiinflammatory therapy with ibuprofen has been proposed to retard the progression of lund disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). The pharmacokinetics and toxicity of ibuprofen were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-month dose-escalation study in 19 children with CF, 6 to 12 years of age. The subjects received orally and twice daily 300 mg of drug during the first month, 400 mg in the second month, and 600 mg in the third month. Ibuprofen pharmacokinetics and evaluation for adverse effects were performed at the beginning and end of each month. The dose of ibuprofen was increased if peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was less than 50 micrograms/ml. To preserve the blind nature of the study, the dose in matched subjects taking placebo was also increased. The subjects randomly assigned to receive ibuprofen (n = 13) completed 26 months of treatment; placebo subjects (n = 5) completed 12 months. With dose escalation, Cmax and the area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity significantly increased (p less than 0.01). The pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen in 13 children with CF who received 13.4 +/- 4.1 mg/kg (mean +/- SD) were compared with those in four healthy children who received a similar dose. Peak plasma concentration (48 +/- 17 micrograms/ml) was decreased by 27% (p = 0.06), the area under the concentration-time curve (6.1 +/- 1.7 mg.min/ml) was decreased by 46% (p less than 0.001), apparent total clearance (2.3 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg-1) was increased by 77% (p less than 0.01), and apparent volume of distribution during terminal phase (291 +/- 91 ml/kg) was increased by 84% (p = 0.01) in the children with CF. Time to Cmax (66 +/- 20 minutes) and elimination half-life (92 +/- 27 minutes) were not significantly different. No subjects were withdrawn from the study because of side effects. No adverse effects could be attributed to ibuprofen. Thus ibuprofen administration has no significant toxic effects, but Cmax will need to be monitored for effective dosing in patients with CF.\r"

The regimens were infused together with glucose at greater than 5 mg/kg per minute, and immediate (4 hours) and cumulative (3 days) effects were assessed. Serum arginine and insulin values rose immediately after administration of aztreonam (containing 0.15 mmol of arginine per kilogram), but there were no changes in the gentamicin-treated cohort; no differences occurred in either cohort in serum concentrations of glucose, ammonia, potassium, creatinine, and bilirubin. After 3 days of antibiotic therapy (n = 13), the baseline serum arginine concentration was almost twice as high in the aztreonam group and showed a similar further rise and fall during the 4 hours after infusion; arginine urinary fractional excretion (normalized to creatinine clearance) decreased in the gentamicin group. The indirect bilirubin concentration rose more (p less than 0.001) in the aztreonam-treated infants (5.1 to 11.5 mg/dl (87 to 196 mumol/L] than in the gentamicin-treated infants (5.5 to 8.1 mg/dl (94 to 138 mumol/L)). Thus a modest differential bilirubin response and modestly elevated baseline serum arginine level occurred after the 3-day low-arginine doses of this study; serum ammonia and glucose concentrations were not affected. Aztreonam-arginine in neonates was well tolerated metabolically, and we believe that it can be used safely in conjunction with attention to glucose and bilirubin metabolism.\r"

We therefore studied the effects of race, pubertal development, and body fatness on WHR during adolescence in a multiethnic population. A total of 688 white, Asian, and Hispanic female adolescents (mean (+/- SD) 12.4 +/- 0.7 years), participating in the evaluation of a multisite school-based health education program, were included in these analyses. Self-assessed stage of puberty and measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference were obtained from each participant. The WHR and age-adjusted body mass index were calculated. Analysis of covariance demonstrated that puberty significantly affects hip circumference and WHR but not waist circumference among female adolescents. Age and fatness, as reflected by age-adjusted body mass index, contributed significantly to both circumferences and to the WHR. There was a significant effect of ethnicity on hip circumference but not on waist circumference or the WHR. These results confirm that pubertal stage exerts a significant effect on the hip circumference and WHR in female adolescents, even after the effects of fatness and age are controlled. Studies of body fat distribution during late childhood and adolescence should include assessments of pubertal maturation.\r"

The ultimate goal of this disease-oriented screen is to facilitate the discovery of new compounds with potential cell line-specific and/or subpanel-specific antitumor activity. In the current screening protocol, each cell line is inoculated onto microtiter plates, then preincubated for 24-28 hours. Subsequently, test agents are added in five 10-fold dilutions and the culture is incubated for an additional 48 hours. For each test agent, a dose-response profile is generated. End-point determinations of the cell viability or cell growth are performed by in situ fixation of cells, followed by staining with a protein-binding dye, sulforhodamine B (SRB). The SRB binds to the basic amino acids of cellular macromolecules; the solubilized stain is measured spectrophotometrically to determine relative cell growth or viability in treated and untreated cells. Following the pilot screening studies, a screening rate of 400 compounds per week has been consistently achieved.\r"

In this study, blood samples were obtained from 21 women at high risk for breast cancer who had been randomly assigned to either a nonintervention diet or a low-fat diet. Oxidative damage was examined in the DNA from nucleated peripheral blood cells. The levels of oxidized thymine, specifically 5-hydroxymethyluracil, were threefold higher in the nonintervention diet group than in the low-fat diet group. Without regard to diet arm, there also was a significant linear relationship between daily total fat intake and 5-hydroxymethyluracil level. These results suggest that oxidative damage to DNA may be a marker of dietary fat intake. In addition, oxidative DNA damage may be a mechanistic link between fat in the diet and cancer risk, since such damage is associated with the process of tumor promotion.\r"

In the present study, we examined additional cell types and determined some of the underlying mechanisms involved in the promotion of tumor formation by Matrigel. The tumor cell lines that we studied included transformed mouse Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor cells (T-EHS), human submandibular carcinoma A253 cells, mouse melanoma B16F10 cells, human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells, and human primary renal cell carcinoma cells. When coinjected subcutaneously with Matrigel, these cell lines formed rapidly proliferating tumors. Primary biopsy specimens of human colon carcinoma, when dispersed and coinjected with Matrigel, also formed tumors. Only A253, KB, and B16F10 cells formed small tumors in the absence of Martrigel, but a fivefold to tenfold increase in tumor size was observed in the presence of Matrigel. These data demonstrate a useful method for improving the growth of human tumors in athymic mice.\r"

  ".W": "The 72-kd type IV collagenase is a member of the collagenase enzyme family that has been closely linked with the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that both normal cells and highly invasive tumor cells produce the 72-kd type IV procollagenase enzyme in a complexed form consisting of the proenzyme and a novel tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, TIMP-2. The balance between activated enzyme and available inhibitor is thought to be a critical determinant of the matrix proteolysis associated with a variety of pathologic processes, including tumor cell invasion. In the present study, we demonstrate that alteration of the metalloproteinase-metalloproteinase-inhibitor balance in favor of excess inhibitor blocks human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 tumor cell invasion of a reconstituted basement membrane. The HT-1080 cell line produces both the 72-kd and the 92-kd type IV collagenases. Alteration of the type IV collagenase-inhibitor balance was achieved by addition of free TIMP-2 or antibodies to 72-kd type IV collagenase. Native, purified TIMP-2 was inhibitory in the range of 1-25 micrograms/mL. Addition of specific antiserum against the 72-kd type IV collagenase, which did not cross-react with the 92-kd type IV collagenase, inhibited HT-1080 cell invasion to the same extent. These results suggest that metalloproteinases, in particular the 72-kd type IV collagenase, are critical for tumor cell invasion of the reconstituted basement membrane. Our findings demonstrate that addition of the endogenous inhibitor TIMP-2 is able to block invasion. Thus, we recommend initiation of in vivo studies of the therapeutic potential of TIMP-2 to block tumor cell invasion and intravasation into the circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue polypeptide antigen (TPpA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured in 59 consecutive breast cancer patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subsequently, we determined that 13 patients had parenchymal brain metastases, 10 had leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and 36 had no CNS involvement. The concentration of TPpA, which is a nonspecific marker for cell proliferation, was significantly higher in patients with CNS metastases than in those without it (P less than .0001; Mann-Whitney test). A tentative cutoff value for CNS metastases was set at 95 U/L TPpA; the upper limit of values indicating absence of CNS metastases was 89 U/L. Given these cutoff points, the sensitivity of TPpA as a marker for CNS metastases was 74% and the specificity was 100%; the predictive values of positive and negative tests were 100% and 86%, respectively. In 16 patients with CNS metastases, no correlation was found between TPpA activity in corresponding CSF and blood samples (correlation coefficient, Spearman's rho = .4; P greater than .1). In three patients treated for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the measurements of CSF TPpA showed correlation between the presence of tumor cells in the CSF and neurological clinical function. TPpA concentrations decreased in parallel with the clinical response and increased prior to CNS disease progression. As a marker for CNS metastases, the level of TPpA in the CSF in breast cancer patients appears to be superior to the level of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, or glucose, which showed very low sensitivity (41%, 47%, and 8%, respectively). For quantitative evaluation of treatment for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the TPpA level appears to be valuable and superior to CSF cytology, because tumor cells are not always present in CSF samples from patients with this condition.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional computed tomographic display formats are not optimal for demonstrating three-dimensional anatomic relationships. In otolaryngology--head and neck surgery these critical relationships are often highly complex, and their complete understanding is essential to a successful surgical outcome. A new computer-generated image display format, high-resolution volume rendering (HRVR), facilities the understanding of these critical anatomic relationships by transforming conventional imaging data into clinically relevant 3-D images. Unlike many other 3-D reconstruction algorithms, HRVR suffers minimal data loss in the conversion process, which in turn provides for superior image resolution. This better allows the application of 3-D technology to small or complicated anatomic structures such as those frequently encountered in otolaryngology--head and neck surgery. Advances in computer-controlled manipulations that further enhance the evaluation of desired pathologic features have been achieved. This pilot study contains representative clinical cases chosen to illustrate the potential utility of HRVR in otolaryngology--head and neck surgery. The authors believe HRVR images will enhance the surgeon's understanding of the 3-D anatomic relationships that exist between critical pathologic features and surrounding vital structures.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the ability of simultaneous cisplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, and radiation to substitute for surgery and radiation in advanced head and neck cancer, we have retrospectively selected from our phase II study a subgroup of 29 patients having primary disease requiring either more than a hemiglossectomy or a laryngectomy for control. Patients included 22 with stage IV and 7 with stage III disease, 12 tongue, 10 hypopharynx, and 7 larynx primaries. The treatment consisted of concurrent cisplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, and split-course radiation every other week for a total of 7 cycles within 13 weeks. With a median follow-up of 5 years, 86% of patients had preservation of speech and/or swallowing function. Median survival was 45 months, with 14 (48%) patients currently alive and disease free, 11 (38%) dead from their cancer, and 4 (14%) dead of other causes. The overall failure rate was 38%. Advanced-stage presence of N3 nodal disease and fewer than 7 cycles of chemotherapy received were significantly associated with increasing failure rates. This program of concomitant cisplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, and radiation produced control rates quite competitive with surgery and radiation and is appropriate for definitive testing in a randomized trial.\r"
