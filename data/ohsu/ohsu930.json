  ".W": "Childhood gastroenteritis remains a common reason for admission to British paediatric units, although the severity of the disease appears to be diminishing in recent years. We studied 215 infants and children with gastroenteritis admitted consecutively to four paediatric units in South Wales in order to determine the severity of the disease, the organisms isolated, the frequency of complications, and the adequacy of management before admission. Stool pathogens were isolated in 125 (58%) patients (viruses in 65, bacteria in 30, and protozoa in 19, with multiple infection found in 11). There was a low incidence of morbidity and complications, but prolonged diarrhoea (postenteritis syndrome) was present in 24 (11%) cases and 77 (36%) had received inappropriate treatment before admission. Contemporary gastroenteritis is thus a relatively mild disease in the acute phase, but management before admission to hospital is often inadequate, and prolonged diarrhoea may be a feature in a considerable number of cases.\r"

The characteristics of the group, and the frequency with which various clinical and laboratory features had been recorded, was assessed. Nine patients were known to have died, in most cases of progressive suppurative infection. Actuarial analysis showed 50% survival through the third decade of life. The long term survival of patients developing symptoms after the end of the first year of life was significantly better than that of patients whose illness started in infancy. Our data confirm that the severity of chronic granulomatous disease is not uniform, and that the prognosis for long term survival is better than that suggested in earlier reports. Early onset may be a poor prognostic sign and invasive aspergillosis is a life threatening complication. In the absence of curative treatment, trials to assess the effectiveness of interferon gamma are necessary and early antenatal diagnosis should be offered to as many affected families as possible.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether latent sensitivity to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) occurs after infection, 27 infants with acute bronchiolitis were studied and compared with 15 hospital controls. Blood was collected for whole blood challenge, and histamine release was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography technique with fluorometric detection. There was a significantly greater histamine release to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) in those with bronchiolitis than in controls, expressed either in amount (median 154 nmol/l compared with 104 nmol/l) or percentage release (median 20% compared with 3%). There was a significant difference between index and control groups in terms of individual histamine responses. These findings strongly suggest that infants develop latent sensitivity to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) during the course of acute bronchiolitis. Serial lung function tests were performed in 15 infants. All infants had abnormalities of lung function at some stage, but the small numbers of subjects precluded comparison between 'sensitised' and 'non-sensitised' infants. Further study is indicated to define the relation of latent sensitisation and subsequent bronchial hyper-responsiveness after respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants.\r"

  ".U": "91024279\r", 
  ".W": "The pathophysiology of recurrent cyanotic episodes has been investigated in 51 infants and children. Episodes began at a median age of 7 weeks (range 1 day to 22 months, 39 at less than 4 months). They were characterised by the rapidity of onset and progression of severe hypoxaemia with early loss of consciousness from cerebral hypoxia. The most common precipitating factor was a sudden naturally occurring stimulus from pain, fear, or anger. In uncontrolled trials, cyanotic episodes were reduced in frequency and severity by tetrabenazine (n = 15) and additional inspired oxygen (n = 10). Eight patients died suddenly and unexpectedly (four during cyanotic episodes). Twenty eight patients underwent physiological studies during cyanotic episodes. There was no evidence of seizure activity at the onset and although prolonged absence of inspiratory effort with continued expiratory efforts was common, breathing sometimes continued. Episodes were not caused by upper airway obstruction and sometimes occurred during positive airway pressure ventilation. The rapidity of fall in arterial oxygen pressure and continued breathing suggested a right to left shunt of sudden onset. The results of contrast echocardiography and lung imaging studies confirmed that this was occurring within the lungs. These cyanotic episodes included both intrapulmonary shunting and prolonged expiratory apnoea. They are best explained by interactions between central sympathetic activity, brainstem control of respiration and vasomotor activity, reflexes arising from around and within the respiratory tract, and the matching of ventilation to perfusion in the lungs. They are a cause of sudden unexpected death in infancy and early childhood.\r"

Banding of the pulmonary artery was performed in seven cases and complete repair in 67 cases. In the period 1971-82 the complete correction was performed at a mean age of 23 months with a surgical mortality of 88.8%. In the period 1983-8 the mean age at complete correction was 13 months, the mortality 43.2%, and the five year actuarial survival was 46.8%. The 22 patients that survived after complete correction were in functional classes I and II of the New York Heart Association classification. After a mean follow up of 10 years only eight (36%) of the 22 who were followed up and treated medically survived; all had developed pulmonary vascular obstructive disease and were in functional classes III or IV. Our findings stress the importance of early complete surgical repair.\r"

Seventy one patients relapsed during or after treatment, which included surgery and chemotherapy, with irradiation depending on stage and histology. Despite treatment with various combinations of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy there were only 17 survivors. For unfavourable histology, any stage, only two of 20 survive. We conclude that, after relapse, even for patients who have had localised disease and favourable histology, the 'salvage' rate is little more than 50% and for all others the likelihood of cure is very small. Three of 41 children who relapsed less than 12 months from diagnosis survive, compared with 14 of 30 who relapsed later. It is essential that even with this 'good prognosis' tumour initial treatment is optimal and given by centres experienced in management of children's cancer. Furthermore, there is a clear need for additional effective chemotherapeutic agents for relapsed patients.\r"

Both plasma elimination half life and area under the plasma concentration time curve were significantly increased in neonates after suppository dosing compared with older children.

Plasma prolactin was higher in girls, with increasing divergence between the sexes from the third week onwards, and higher after two weeks, in infants of mothers with pregnancy related hypertension. Diet, assigned randomly, exerted a major effect on plasma prolactin, with significantly higher values in infants fed donor breast milk or standard formula than in those fed a protein, energy, and mineral enriched preterm formula. After adjusting for confounding factors, infants with the lowest plasma prolactin concentrations (less than 1000 mU/l, 32.9 micrograms/l) occurring usually at a nadir between days 5 and 12, showed a 120% increase in the duration of ventilatory assistance required, a 20% increase in the number of days to attain full enteral feeds, and a 30% decrease in length gain. We suggest preterm birth disrupts the normal perinatal pattern of prolactin release and that those infants who develop relatively low plasma concentration have an adverse outcome. Our data add to the broader debate on whether preterm infants require multiple endocrine replacement treatment.\r"

Isolated rabbit hearts (n = 30) were retrograde perfused with Krebs-Ringers bicarbonate solution aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2 through the aortic root (37 C, 80 mmHg). Developed left ventricular blood pressure, heart rate, coronary artery flow, contractility as reflected by peak +dp/dt, oxygen extraction (a-vO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured at baseline and continuously throughout the experiment. Protamine (25 micrograms, 50 micrograms, and 250 micrograms per mL of perfusate) was circulated in the Krebs-Ringers buffer to hearts perfused without heparin (groups I, II, and III) or hearts perfused with heparin added to the buffer solution, 0.1 IU/1.0 microgram protamine (groups IV, V, and VI). Blood pressure 4 minutes after protamine was less in groups III (-23 mmHg) and VI (-28 mmHg) than in groups I (-6 mmHg), II (-18 mmHg), IV (-1 mmHg), and V (-7 mmHg). Heart rate changes (beats/minute) at 4 minutes revealed similar dose-dependent reductions (III and VI: -51, -55; II and V: -36, -36; and I and IV: -20, -16, respectively). Coronary artery flow at 4 minutes was slightly increased in groups III (9 mL/minute) and VI (15 mL/minute), but was relatively unchanged in the other groups. Decreases in contractility were apparent in all groups 4 minutes after protamine was started: group I, -14%; II, -16%; III, -30%; IV, -7%; V, -15%; and VI, -34%. Similarly declines in oxygen extraction and consumption were noted in all groups at the same time period and were greater in groups III (-53%, -44%) and VI (-55%, -49%) than in groups I (-25%, -26%), II (-15%, -12%), IV (-48%, -49%) and V (-15%, -18%), with p less than or equal to 0.05 or p less than or equal to 0.01 compared to baseline. Three of ten hearts exposed to high-dose protamine stopped beating after 5 minutes. This investigation establishes, for the first time, that protamine has dose- and time-specific adverse effects on cardiac contractility. In addition protamine decreases myocardial a-vO2 and VO2. These changes may contribute to certain adverse events accompanying the clinical administration of protamine.\r"

In no patient did the calcitonin level return to normal after re-exploration. The presence of more than three metastatic nodes at the time of initial operation was a statistically significant (p = 0.003) predictor for disease recurrence.

In the last 5 years, 13% of patients had therapeutically significant stenoses or occlusions above and below the groin, while 35% had them at two or three levels below the inguinal ligament. Unobstructed arterial flow to the distal half of the thigh was present in 26% of patients, and 16% had unobstructed flow to the upper third of the leg with occlusions of all three leg arteries distal to this point and reconstitution of some patent named artery in the lower leg or foot. In the last 2 years, 99% of all patients with a threatened limb and without severe organic mental syndrome or midfoot gangrene were amenable to revascularization by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), arterial bypass, or a combination of the two, although some distal arteries used for bypass insertion were heavily diseased or isolated segments without an intact plantar arch. Limb salvage was achieved and maintained in more than 90% of recent patient cohorts, with a mean procedural mortality rate of 3.3%. Recent strategies that contributed to these results include (1) distal origin short vein grafts from the below-knee popliteal or tibial arteries to an ankle or foot artery (291 cases); (2) combined PTA and bypass (245 cases); (3) more distal PTA of popliteal and tibial artery stenoses (233 cases); (4) use of in situ or ectopic reversed autogenous vein for infrapopliteal bypasses, even when vein diameter was 3 to 4 mm; (5) composite-sequential femoropopliteal-distal (PTFE/vein) bypasses; (6) reintervention when a procedure thrombosed (637 cases) or was threatened by a hemodynamically significant inflow, outflow, or graft lesion (failing graft, 252 cases); (7) frequent follow-up to detect threatening lesions before graft thrombosis occurred and to permit correction of lesions by PTA (58%) or simple reoperation; and (8) unusual approaches to all infrainguinal arteries to facilitate secondary operations, despite scarring and infection. Primary major amputation rates decreased from 41% to 5% and total amputation rates decreased from 49% to 14%. Aggressive policies to save threatened limbs thus are supported.\r"

  ".W": "Reduction of cardiac mortality associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair remains an important goal. Five hundred consecutive urgent or elective operations for infrarenal nonruptured AAA were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on preoperative cardiac status: group I (n = 260, 52%), no clinical or electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD); group II (n = 212, 42.2%), clinical or ECG evidence of CAD considered stable after further evaluation with studies such as dipyridamole-thallium scanning, echocardiography, or coronary arteriography; group III (n = 28, 5.6%), clinical or ECG evidence of CAD considered unstable after further evaluation. Group I had no further cardiac evaluation and groups I and II underwent AAA repair without invasive treatment of CAD. Group III underwent repair of cardiac disease before (n = 21) or coincident with (n = 7) AAA repair. In all instances, perioperative fluid volume management was based on left ventricular performance curves constructed before operation. The 30-day operative mortality rate for AAA repair in all 500 patients was 1.6% (n = 8). There was one (0.4%) cardiac-related operative death in group I, which was significantly less than the five (2.4%) in group II (p less than 0.02). Total mortality for the two groups were also significantly different, with one group I death (0.4%) and seven group II deaths (3.3%), (p less than 0.02). These data support the conclusions that (1) the leading cause of perioperative mortality in AAA repair is myocardial infarction, (2) correction of severe or unstable CAD before or coincident with AAA repair is effective in preventing operative mortality, (3) patients with known CAD should be investigated more thoroughly to identify those likely to develop perioperative myocardial ischemia so that their CAD can be corrected before AAA repair, and (4) patients with no clinical or ECG evidence of CAD rarely die of perioperative myocardial infarction, and thus selective evaluation of CAD based on clinical grounds in AAA patients is justified.\r"

  ".U": "91024336\r", 
  ".W": "Within a 12-year period we treated 67 patients (49 women, 18 men; mean age, 61 years) with cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, including 18 serous cystic adenomas, 15 benign mucinous cystic neoplasms, 27 mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 3 papillary cystic tumors, 2 cystic islet cell tumors, and 2 cases of mucinous ductal ectasia. Mean tumor size was 6 cm (2 to 16 cm). In 39% the patients had no symptoms, and in 37% the lesions had been misdiagnosed as a pseudocyst. Computed tomography was useful for detection, for distinguishing the microcystic subgroup of serous cystadenoma, and for showing rim calcification (all 7 cases were malignant) but was not reliable for distinguishing neoplasm from pseudocyst, serous from mucinous tumors, or benign from malignant. Arteriography showed hypervascularity in 4 of 10 serous adenomas, 3 of 11 mucinous carcinomas, and 1 of 1 papillary cystic tumors. Endoscopic pancreatography showed no communication with the cyst cavity in 37 of 37 cases of cystic neoplasms but opacified the ectatic ducts in 2 of 2 cases of mucinous ductal ectasia. Stenosis or obstruction of the pancreatic duct indicated cancer. The tumor was resected by distal pancreatectomy in 25 patients, by proximal resection in 29, and by total pancreatectomy in one, with no operative deaths. Forty-four per cent of the tumors were malignant. In 10 cases the tumor was unresectable because of local extension or distant metastases, and those patients died at a mean of 4 months. Seventy-five per cent of those resected for cure are alive without evident recurrence. Because the epithelial lining of the tumor was partially (5% to 98%) absent in 40% to 72% of cases of the major tumor types, and the mucinous component comprised only about 65% of mucinous cystadenoma lining, misdiagnoses on frozen and even permanent sections were made. Mitoses and histologic solid growth correlated with malignancy. Neuroendocrine elements were seen in 87% of benign and 47% of malignant mucinous tumors. It is recommended that the terms macrocystic and microcystic be abandoned in favor of the histologic designations serous and mucinous. Incomplete examination of the cyst wall can be misleading, however. It is suggested that mucinous ductal ectasia be recognized separately from cystic tumors and that all of these lesions be resected, with the possible exception of asymptomatic confirmed serous cystadenomas.\r"

  ".W": "The aim was to assess the value of reoperative surgery for pouch-related complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for chronic ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Between January 1981 and August 1989, 114 of 982 IPAA patients (12%) seen at the Mayo Clinic had complications directly related to IPAA that required reoperation. Among the 114 patients, the complications prevented initial ileostomy closure in 33 patients (25%), occurred after ileostomy closure in 68 patients (60%), and delayed ileostomy closure in the remaining patients. The salvage procedures performed included anal dilatation under anesthesia for anastomotic strictures, placement of setons and/or fistulotomy for perianal fistulae, unroofing of anastomotic sinuses, simple drainage and antibiotics for perianal abscesses, abdominal exploration with drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses with or without establishment of ileostomy, and complete or partial reconstruction of the reservoir for patients with inadequate emptying. None of the reoperated patients died. Reoperation led to restoration of pouch function in two thirds of patients and, of these, 70% had an excellent clinical outcome. However approximately 20% of the 114 pouches required excision. Excision was common, especially among patients who had pelvic sepsis. Salvage procedures for pouch-specific complications can be done safely and will restore pouch function in two thirds of patients. Complications after reoperation, however, may ultimately lead to loss of the reservoir in one in five patients.\r"

  ".U": "91024338\r", 
  ".W": "Gallbladder tissue from patients with acute acalculous cholecystitis contains increased amounts of prostanoids when compared to normal gallbladder tissue. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent stimulus of eicosanoid formation. It has been implicated as a mediator of acute inflammatory processes and systemic responses to shock. In this study the role of PAF in acute acalculous cholecystitis was evaluated. Anesthetized cats underwent gallbladder perfusion with a physiologic buffer solution containing [14C]polyethylene glycol as a nonabsorbable tracer to quantitate mucosal water absorption. Platelet-activating factor was infused into the hepatic artery for 2 hours. Control experiments were performed when vehicle alone was infused. Experiments also were performed when indomethacin was administered intravenously and when indomethacin and PAF were administered. Gallbladder mucosal absorption/secretion and perfusate and tissue prostaglandin E (PGE) and 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto PGF1 alpha) levels were evaluated. Gallbladder inflammation was evaluated by beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase tissue concentrations and by a histologic scoring system. Platelet-activating factor eliminated gallbladder absorption and produced net fluid secretion associated with dose-related increases in perfusate PGE concentrations and gallbladder tissue PGE and 6 keto PGF1 alpha levels when compared to control values. Platelet-activating factor produced significant inflammation in the gallbladder with increases in the histologic score of inflammation and tissue lysosomal enzyme activities. Indomethacin significantly decreased the fluid secretion, prostanoid levels, and inflammation produced by PAF. The results suggest that PAF may induce acute gallbladder inflammation associated with systemic stress through a prostanoid-mediated mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "91024340\r", 
  ".W": "From June 1984 to September 1989, 43 patients with large vena caval tumor thrombi from retroperitoneal malignancies underwent surgical treatment with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). The primary malignancies were renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n = 39), renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), adrenal pheochromocytoma (n = 1), and renal (n = 1) or retroperitoneal (n = 1) sarcoma. The level of the caval thrombus was either suprahepatic (n = 27), intrahepatic (n = 14), or subhepatic (n = 2). In all cases the primary tumor and caval thrombus were completely removed. Concomitant procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 5), pulmonary resection (n = 2), and hepatic lobectomy (n = 1). The time of circulatory arrest ranged from 10 to 44 minutes (mean, 23.5 minutes). There were two operative deaths (4.7%), neither of them due to to the use of DHCA. Major postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (30.2%). There were no ischemic or neurologic complications and no cases of perioperative tumor embolization. The median postoperative hospital stay was 9 days. Twenty-two patients (51%) are alive and enjoying a good quality of life. The 3-year patient survival rates in patients with localized (n = 24) versus metastatic (n = 15) RCC are 63.9% and 10.9%, respectively (p = 0.02). We conclude that CPB with DHCA facilities excision of retroperitoneal malignancies with large caval thrombi and provides the potential for cure with low morbidity and mortality rates.\r"

  ".W": "The process of microbial translocation was studied using Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, or endotoxin instilled into Thiry-Vella loops of thermally injured guinea pigs and rats. Translocation of C. albicans occurred by direct penetration of enterocytes by a unique process different from classical phagocytosis. Translocation between enterocytes was not observed. Internalization was associated with a disturbance of the plasma membrane and brush border, but most internalized organisms were not surrounded by a plasma membrane. Passage of the candida into the lamina propria appeared to be associated with disruption of the basal membrane with extrusion of cytoplasm of the cell and candida. Organisms in the lamina propria were commonly phagocytized by macrophages but also were found free in lymphatics and blood vessels. Translocation of E. coli and endotoxin also occurred directly through enterocytes rather than between them, but translocated endotoxin diffused through the lamina propria and muscular wall of the bowel wall by passing between rather than through the myocytes. These descriptive phenomena provide new insight into the role of the enterocyte and intestinal immune cells in the translocation process.\r"

  ".W": "Acid aspiration-induced systemic organ injury is mediated by the sequestration of activated neutrophils (PMN). In other settings cytokines have been shown to increase neutrophil-endothelial adhesion, a requisite for injury. This study tests whether the systemic leukosequestration and permeability following localized aspiration is mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced synthesis of an adhesion protein. Anesthetized rats underwent tracheostomy and insertion of a fine-bore cannula into the anterior segment of the left lung. This was followed by the instillation of either 0.1 mL 0.1 N HCI (n = 18) or 0.1 mL saline in control rats (n = 18). Localized aspiration induced generalized pulmonary leukosequestration with 95 PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) in the aspirated lung and 46 PMN/10 HPF in the nonaspirated lung, higher than control values of 7 PMN/10 HPF and 5 PMN/10 HPF in saline- and nonsaline-aspirated sides, respectively (p less than 0.05). The leukosequestration was associated with permeability edema shown by increased protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 3900 micrograms/mL in the aspirated and 2680 micrograms/mL in the nonaspirated side, higher than saline with 482 micrograms/mL and 411 micrograms/mL, respectively (p less than 0.05). There was generalized pulmonary edema following aspiration measured by increase in wet-to-dry weight ratios (w/d) of 6.6 in the aspirated and 5.1 in the nonaspirated lung, higher than control values of 3.5 and 3.4, respectively (p less than 0.05). Localized aspiration led to systemic leukosequestration documented by increases in myeloperoxidase activity (units/g tissue) of 2.2 and 1.7 in heart and kidney, higher than control values of 0.3 and 0.4, respectively (p less than 0.05). This event was associated with edema of these organs with w/d ratios of 4.6 and 4.3, relative to control values of 3.0 and 3.4 (p less than 0.05). Treatment of animals (n = 18) 20 minutes after aspiration with anti-TNF-alpha antiserum (rabbit anti-murine) but not normal rabbit serum (n = 18) reduced lung leukosequestration in the aspirated and nonaspirated segments (61 and 32 PMN/10HPF), BAL protein concentration (1490 and 840 micrograms/mL), and w/d ratio (4.3 and 3.7) (all p less than 0.05). In the heart and kidney there were reductions in myeloperoxidase activity (0.7 and 0.6) and w/d ratio (3.5 and 3.6) (both p less than 0.05). Treatment of rabbits (n = 18) with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, 0.2 mg/kg/hr was as effective as TNF-alpha antiserum in modifying aspiration injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This study reviews 469 patients admitted to a surgical service of an urban hospital. There were 562 total admissions because 53 patients were readmitted 93 times (recurrence rate, 20%). The most common causes of bleeding, all endoscopically diagnosed, included acute gastric mucosal lesion (AGML) (135 patients, 24%), esophageal varices (EV) (121 patients, 22%), gastric ulcer (108 patients, 19%), duodenal ulcer (78 patients, 14%), Mallory-Weiss tear (61 patients, 11%), and esophagitis (15 patients, 3%). Nonoperative therapy was sufficient in 504 cases (89.5%). Endoscopic treatment was used in 144 cases. Operations were performed in 58 cases (10.5%), including 29% of ulcers. Emergency operations to control hemorrhage were required in only 2.5% of all cases. The rate of major surgical complications was 11% and the mortality rate was 5.2%. There were 58 deaths (12.6%), with 36 deaths directly attributable to UGIB. Factors correlating with death include shock at admission (systolic blood pressure less than 80), transfusion requirement of more than five units, and presence of EV (all p less than 0.001). Most cases of UGIB can be treated without operation, including endoscopic treatment, when diagnostic endoscopy establishes the source. Subsequent operation in selected patients can be done with low morbidity and mortality rates.\r"

There were 20 strictures, 7 giant ulcers, 11 cases of dysplasia, and 29 patients with carcinoma. In patients with benign disease, 93% had mechanically defective sphincters and 83% had peristaltic failure of the lower esophageal body. Esophageal pH monitoring showed excessive esophageal exposure to pH less than 4 in 93% and excessive exposure to pH more than 7 in 34% of the patients tested. Ninety-three per cent of patients with excessive alkaline exposure had complications, compared to only 44% with normal alkaline exposure (p less than 0.01). Gastric pH monitoring, serum gastrin levels, and gastric acid analysis supported a duodenal source for the alkaline exposure. Antireflux surgery was performed using Nissen fundoplication in 30, Belsey partial fundoplication in 3, and Collis-Belsey gastroplasty in 2. Six required resection with colon interposition. Good symptomatic control was achieved in 77% after antireflux surgery. Four patients had symptoms and signs of duodenogastric reflux; three required a bile diversion procedure. Fifteen patients had an en bloc curative resection with colon interposition. One patient with high-grade dysplasia on biopsy was found to have intramucosal carcinoma after simple esophagectomy. Five tumors were intramucosal, seven were intramural, and four were transmural. Lymph node involvement occurred only in the latter two. Actuarial survival 5 years after curative resection was 53%. Median survival time for patients after palliative resection or no resection was 12 months. Study of en bloc specimens indicated that extent of resection should be adapted to extent of disease: esophagectomy for intramucosal disease, en bloc esophagectomy with splenic preservation for intramural and transmural disease. Serum CEA was useful in detecting recurrent disease after surgery when the primary tumor stained positively for CEA.\r"

Twelve patients (48%) died at mean day 40 and median day 26. Levels of ionized calcium, parathormone, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, magnesium, and phosphate for patients who lived were compared with levels for patients who died. The incidence of hypotension, renal failure (creatinine greater than or equal to 3.0), and bacteremia, as well as the amount of red cell, crystalloid, and colloid administration for the two groups was compared. Hypotension, bacteremia, red cells, crystalloid, and colloid were no different. On days 1 and 2 ionized calcium levels were significantly lower and parathormone levels significantly higher in nonsurviving patients; this difference persisted through days 3 and 4. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels increased early in nonsurviving patients but renal failure, which occurred in nine nonsurviving patients, did not develop until mean day 14, median day 18. The phosphate level was slightly higher but still within normal range in nonsurviving patients. By days 5 and 6 ionized calcium and parathormone levels were no different in nonsurviving patients, despite there being no improvement in renal function. Magnesium and albumin levels were no different between groups. Ionized calcium levels are lower and parathormone levels higher early in nonsurviving patients. This difference is not readily explained by associated clinical conditions, including renal dysfunction. Although etiology remains unclear, low ionized calcium and elevated parathormone are early predictors of mortality in critically ill surgical patients.\r"

Seventy-five of one hundred three deaths (73%) were related to liver failure, bleeding, or sepsis. Of 14 patients undergoing portosystemic shunt, 13 died of surgical complications or related disease. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in 16 patients and resulted in eight deaths, mainly in patients who had previously undergone extensive surgical treatment. No survival differences were seen between the patients with inflammatory bowel disease, those without the condition, or those who had colectomy. Surgical treatment in patients with sclerosing cholangitis should be minimized. Orthotopic liver transplantation should be offered as the treatment of choice for patients with portal hypertension, refractory cholangitis, advanced cirrhosis, or progressive liver failure.\r"

Eleven of the 12 children are alive after a mean follow-up of 36 months. In group 1, 1 patient died and 3 patients (50%) experienced recurrent respiratory distress. Five infants sustained a major postoperative complication, and the average postoperative hospital stay was 25 days. In group 2, however, aortopexy was uniformly successful. There were no deaths, no postoperative complications, and no cases of postoperative respiratory distress, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was only 10 days. For children with reflex apnea after repair of esophageal atresia, aortopexy is lifesaving and can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. Great caution is indicated in children with tracheal compression from other causes.\r"

Typically, patients with blunt chest trauma and suspected cardiac injury have required cardiac monitoring for 48 to 72 hours. Predicting which patients with blunt chest trauma are not at risk for cardiac complications would obviate many patient-hours of monitoring in the intensive care unit. This series examines the sensitivity of two-dimensional surface echocardiography in predicting cardiac complications. Over a 24-month period, 115 patients were admitted with blunt chest trauma and prospectively evaluated for cardiac injury with admission electrocardiograms, serial creatine kinase isoenzyme studies, and two-dimensional echocardiography. Thirty-one patients (27%) had abnormal two-dimensional echocardiograms. In 8 (25.8%) of these patients, cardiac complications requiring treatment developed. Eighty-four patients (73%) had normal two-dimensional echocardiograms, and a cardiac complication requiring treatment developed in only 1 (1.2%) of them. Of the 9 patients who required treatment of cardiac complications, 3 had normal admission electrocardiograms and only 1 had elevated levels of the myocardial-specific isoenzymes of creatine kinase. We believe two-dimensional echocardiography is a sensitive test for evaluating cardiac injury resulting from blunt chest trauma and is helpful in selecting those patients who require monitoring in the intensive care unit.\r"

A model of clinicopathological staging, based on both clinical stage and histological type, in which three major prognostic groups are considered is proposed. The degree of significance of this model is higher (p less than 0.0001) than that of clinical stage and histological type considered individually; its validity is further supported by the results of multivariate analysis according to the Cox regression model (p = 0.0001). We think it represents a prognostically valuable approach to the problem of management of thymoma.\r"

Ultrasonography was carried out with a 10-MHz probe placed directly on the ascending aorta. Ultrasonic imaging demonstrated an atherosclerotic lesion in the lower half of the aorta in 76 patients (76%), a lesion in the upper half of the aorta in 89 patients (89%), and a lesion at the orifice of the innominate artery in 99 patients (99%). Prospective palpation identified an atherosclerotic lesion in 12 (25%) of 48 patients. Thoracic computed tomography in 79 patients showed calcification in the lower half of the aorta in 6 patients (7.6%) and in the upper half of the aorta in 11 (13.9%). Palpation and thoracic computed tomography underestimated the frequency of atherosclerotic lesions. Intraoperative ultrasonography accurately identified atherosclerotic disease. This technique allows the surgeon to modify cannulation, aortic clamping, and operative technique to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke due to embolization of atherosclerotic debris from the ascending aorta.\r"

  ".W": "Ischemic spinal cord injury after aortic cross-clamping may be produced by a steal phenomenon. The present study investigates this possibility by directly measuring the oxygen tension on the spinal cord surface in pigs. After simple clamping of the aorta, oxygen tension decreased significantly distal to the clamping site both after occlusion of the thoracic aorta at T3-4 (group 1) and after occlusion of the abdominal aorta at L-1 (group 2). Exclusion of the thoracic aorta by a second clamp at T-13 restored oxygen tension almost to the original level, whereas segmentation of the abdominal aorta up to S-1 hardly affected oxygen tension in the area of the artery of Adamkiewicz in most of the animals. We conclude that after aortic cross-clamping, blood tends to drain away from the spinal cord rather than supplying it longitudinally. Without knowledge of the position of the Adamkiewicz artery in humans as well as of the competence of the collateral circulation in the excluded segment, it is necessary to develop a new strategy for repair of the aorta. We describe and discuss two surgical techniques for the prevention of paraplegia after aortic cross-clamping: the counterocclusion technique and the bypass fractionated technique.\r"

Postoperative complications included reoperation for bleeding in 1 patient and diaphragmatic dysfunction in another. Postoperative coronary angiography 2 days before discharge (mean time, 10 days postoperatively) revealed that all the sequential anastomoses with the combined IMA graft were patent. Exercise tolerance tests performed 3 and 11 months postoperatively indicated excellent results and no ischemia.

Nine patients continue to be employed. Eleven are in sinus rhythm, 3 have permanent pacemakers, and 2 have chronic atrial arrhythmias. Echocardiography showed atrioventricular valve insufficiency in 3 patients and reduced contractility in 4, but no new tumor recurrences. The long-term prognosis of this relatively large group of patients with cardiac myxomas has been good. Patients without the complex myxoma syndrome had no recurrence, whereas 2 patients did require reoperation for mitral valve replacement. Long-term disability and chronic arrhythmias have been infrequent, and functional status and employability of these patients have been very good.\r"

Resection of the obstructing atrial membrane was performed using hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in all cases. Left atriotomy was performed in 6 patients, and right atriotomy was performed in 7. The two postoperative deaths occurred in patients who had serious associated cardiac defects. Associated anomalies include atrial septal defect, persistent left superior vena cava, and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return.

This injury can be life threatening, however, and failure to diagnose it early can lead to disastrous acute or delayed complications. Nine cases of tracheobronchial disruption in the setting of nonpenetrating thoracic trauma were seen at four Los Angeles trauma centers between 1980 and 1987. Mechanism of injury, presentation, diagnosis, and management of these patients were reviewed. Disruptions involved the trachea in 3 patients, the right bronchus in 5 patients, and the left bronchus in 2 patients. Tracheobronchial disruptions occurred in settings of high-energy impact-type injuries and were more likely to have associated injuries than they were to occur alone. Common presenting signs included subcutaneous emphysema, dyspnea, sternal tenderness, and hemoptysis. Radiographic findings were most commonly pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and clavicle or rib fractures. Rigid bronchoscopy and fiberoptic bronchoscopy were both highly accurate methods for diagnosis but only in the hands of trained cardiothoracic surgeons. Delay in diagnosis increased the likelihood of postoperative complications.\r"

This study addresses the effect of long-term amiodarone administration on recovery of cardiac function after a period of global ischemia. Normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats were used. Normotensive rats (n = 6) received 240 mg/kg amiodarone for 4 weeks, for a total of 72 +/- 3 mg. Hypertensive rats (n = 6) received 500 mg/kg amiodarone for 4 weeks, for a total of 116 +/- 5 mg. Final myocardial concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone were 1.85 +/- 1.75 and 0.50 +/- 0.61 micrograms/g wet weight for the normotensive rats and 1.30 +/- 0.58 and 0.31 +/- 0.17 micrograms/g for the hypertensive rats (p = nonsignificant). Equal numbers of controls received sterile saline solution for 4 weeks. The hearts were excised and perfused in a Langendorff apparatus. The results indicate that, after 15 minutes of normothermic ischemia, hearts treated with this relatively low dose of amiodarone recovered a greater percentage of preischemic work (97% +/- 13%) as compared with the controls (76% +/- 17%) (p less than 0.005).\r"

The precise extent of tunnel stenosis was seen in both patients. The lateral attachment of the membrane in 4 patients and multiple extensions in another 2 were identified by the epicardial study (having been missed on precordial echocardiography). The discrete membrane was enucleated in 10 of the 11 patients and was partially resected in 1. One tunnel obstruction was completely relieved; the other was partially relieved. Reduplicated mitral valve tissue in the remaining patient was completely resected. Epicardial imaging after bypass showed remnants of the membrane in 2 patients. Intraoperative Doppler echocardiography and color flow imaging confirmed the absence of clinically significant residual gradients (less than 20 mm Hg) in all but 1 patient with tunnel obstruction. Epicardial imaging provided excellent morphological information about obstructive lesions of the left ventricular outflow tract and enabled immediate assessment of surgical repair.\r"

Both the intrathoracic and intraspinal components of the tumor were resected at one time by a thoracic and neurosurgical team. We employed the Grillo technique three times and a separate laminectomy and thoracotomy approach. Magnetic resonance imaging proved the most useful diagnostic technique for suspected dumbbell mediastinal tumors. In our experience, the extended thoracotomy proposed by Grillo and co-workers worked well for small tumors involving only one foramen in which the intraspinal extension was limited to 2 to 3 cm, and when no more than two laminectomies were required. On the other hand, thoracotomy and a longitudinal paravertebral incision are preferable for larger tumors (more than 4 cm) involving more than one foramen in which the intraspinal extension exceeds 2 to 3 cm, for tumors requiring multiple laminectomy, and when bony infiltration is present.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate risks and complications of reoperations on heart valve prostheses, we reviewed data on 183 patients who underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve malfunction. The incremental effect of the redo procedure on hospital mortality and morbidity was studied by comparing primary and reoperative procedures and analyzing a series of possible predisposing factors. Late survival after first and second reoperations was computed, and possible determinants of late mortality were examined. Overall operative mortality was 8.7%; emergency operation (p = 0.0001), previous thromboembolism (p = 0.05), and advanced New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.031) were the independent determinants. In a series of 1,355 patients having primary or secondary isolated valve replacement, the redo procedure was a significant risk factor in the univariate analysis (p = 0.025) but not in the multivariate analysis except for the subset of patients having mitral valve replacement (p = 0.052). The postoperative course was quite complicated, as evidenced by the long mean stay in the intensive care unit (mean stay, 3.8 days; longer than 2 days for 26% of the survivors). Nevertheless, postoperative complications were not significantly greater after a redo procedure than after a primary operation. Actuarial survival at 7 years was 57.3% +/- 8%. A comparison with a nonhomogeneous series from our institution did not demonstrate significant differences. In the subset of 16 patients having a second reoperation, late survival was 37.8% +/- 16% at 2 years. Advanced New York Heart Association class (p = 0.0001), double prosthetic valve dysfunction (p = 0.003), and any indication other than primary tissue failure (p = 0.06) were determinants of late mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To further explore this phenomenon, we measured plasma levels of activated complement components (radioimmunoassay), assessed neutrophil n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) receptor status (radioligand saturation binding assay), and quantified pulmonary epithelial permeability as radioaerosol lung clearance of technetium 99m-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid in a series of 8 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Significant elevations of plasma C3adesArg, C4adesArg, and C5adesArg levels were seen just after CPB, indicating activation of both the classic and alternate complement pathways. Neutrophil activation was evident as increased expression of neutrophil FMLP surface receptors after bypass. Despite the presence of complement and neutrophil activation, increased pulmonary epithelial permeability was not seen. These data support the hypothesis that complement and neutrophil activation during cardiopulmonary bypass is not associated with acute lung injury, at least not pulmonary epithelial injury. One can therefore infer that increased pulmonary epithelial permeability in patients at high risk for and experiencing sepsis-induced and trauma-induced adult respiratory distress syndrome may be due to factors other than complement and neutrophil activation.\r"

  ".W": "The postoperative courses of 39 patients with severe lung disease (31 with obstructive disease and 8 restrictive) who underwent a cardiac operation were retrospectively reviewed. The stay in the intensive care unit of the study group was 7.9 +/- 10.3 days (mean +/- standard deviation) compared with 2.4 +/- 3.9 days for the control group (100 patients with less impaired pulmonary function) (p less than 0.001). The study group also had a greater number of valve replacements than did the control group (p less than 0.01). Patients with obstructive disease had more respiratory complications than did patients with restrictive disease (p less than 0.05). There were 21 cases of atelectasis. Effusions were noted in 11 patients. Ten patients had bronchospasm. Bronchial secretions were a major problem in 6 patients. Pneumonia developed in 4 patients, and pneumothorax occurred in 3 others. The two in-hospital deaths were not directly related to pulmonary complications. Our findings indicate that (1) patients with severe lung impairment generally do well after a cardiac operation but have more postoperative pulmonary complications than patients with less impairment; (2) patients with restrictive pulmonary disease appear to fare better than those with obstructive disease; (3) pulmonary function tests can alert the clinician to the possible risk of postoperative complications, but they cannot, by themselves, be used to exclude patients from operation; and (4) patients with severe pulmonary impairment facing valve replacement are at greater risk of pulmonary complications than patients having other types of cardiac surgical intervention.\r"

The principal operative procedures were sleeve lobectomy and sleeve pneumonectomy for bronchogenic carcinoma, but 11 limited bronchial resections were performed in patients with benign lesions, minute bronchogenic carcinomas, and low-grade malignant tumors. Of the 94 patients with malignant tumors, 79 underwent a bronchoplastic procedure without carinal resection (sleeve lobectomy in 75 and limited bronchial resection in 4), and there was one operative death (1.3%). The overall 5-year survival rate for the patients with bronchogenic carcinoma in this group was 45% and that for patients undergoing curative resection, 57% (survival of patients in stages I, II, and IIIA was 79%, 55%, and 30%, respectively). A bronchoplastic procedure with carinal resection was performed in 15 patients. Twelve in this group underwent sleeve pneumonectomy. There were two operative deaths, and 1 patient has survived for longer than 4 years. Two patients with low-grade malignant tumors underwent carinal resection without lung resection and are still alive. We believe that bronchoplasty is a safe and valuable procedure and that limited bronchial resection appears to be the procedure of choice for localized bronchial lesions.\r"

Modifications of this technique can be used in performing proximal aortic root reconstruction with a composite valved conduit.

Bronchi opening into the pericyst cavity allow for discharge of fluid matter but not the escape of solid remnants of the collapsed parasite. Operative manipulation of the involved lung in the course of surgical management of chronic ruptured pulmonary hydatids can force fragments of the laminated membrane or small daughter cysts into the bronchial tree. Such extruded solid fragments lodge in bronchi of the same or opposite lung with resulting acute obstruction of airways. Intraoperative bronchial aspiration of hydatid material was seen in 7 patients with ruptured hydatid cysts of the lung, either primary or secondary to transdiaphragmatic extension of liver hydatids. The first clinical sign can be unexplained difficulty in ventilation. Effective management consists of prompt exposure of the stem bronchus on the operative side, with bronchotomy for suction retrieval of escaped solid fragments of the parasite.\r"

A standard, commercially available transesophageal echocardiography probe (5 MHz, 64 elements) was used in all patients without complications. Transesophageal echocardiography proved helpful in selecting the surgical approach, in assessing the adequacy of surgical repair, in detecting residual intracardiac shunts, and in allowing uninterrupted monitoring of ventricular performance throughout the procedure. Our initial experience suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is a valuable tool to be used in children with congenital cardiac malformations, particularly in those requiring complex intracardiac procedures. The amount of information obtained by the surgeon should favor the routine use of transesophageal echocardiography during open heart procedures and stimulate the development of probes to be safely used even in infants and newborns.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed the impact of evolving issues in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on transfusion support for these patients. Issues include increased awareness of transfusion risks, reappraisal of traditional indicators triggering transfusion, and evolving alternatives to homologous blood transfusion such as autologous blood and pharmacologic therapy. These issues have been prompted by programs, such as the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conferences, to provide physicians with guidelines for appropriate use of blood components. However, evidence suggests that transfusion practice in coronary artery bypass grafting procedures remains variable and does not take into account the results of recently published clinical studies. We have therefore developed guidelines and recommendations for transfusion support in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. In summary, they are the following. 1. Institutions with coronary artery bypass grafting programs should establish a multidisciplinary approach to use a combination of interventions designed to minimize homologous blood exposure. 2. Prophylactic transfusion of plasma and platelets are of no benefit and therefore carry an unnecessary risk to the patient. 3. Special request products such as designated blood donation from first-degree relatives should not be used because of the risk of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease. 4. For support of intravascular volume, crystalloids or colloids should be used because they do not have the potential to transmit infection.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this review was to evaluate published evidence for the association between gastric resection for benign disorders and subsequent cancer of the gastric remnant. We searched the literature through Medline (1970 to 1988) and through the references of relevant articles. Fifty-eight studies consisting of case series, uncontrolled surveys, and case control or cohort analyses were identified and critically assessed using defined methodological criteria. There were no consistent differences between the expected and observed number of cancers occurring within 15 years after gastric resection. However, all case control studies and seven of the eight cohort analyses, in which the prevalence of cancer was stratified by time since gastric resection, indicated a twofold to fourfold increase in the risk of gastric cancer in patients who survived 15 or more years after gastric surgery. We conclude that most studies of the association of gastric surgery with subsequent gastric cancer have relatively weak designs. Still, the repetitive demonstration of this association by different investigators using different research designs supports the hypothesis that gastric resection increases the risk of cancer in the gastric remnant.\r"

Twenty-six patients were referred for other complaints similar to syncope (ie, blackouts, loss of consciousness, falling out, passing out, and fainting). Of these 26 patients, five (19.2%) had abnormal findings. We reviewed the medical records of the patients with abnormal findings and found that the final diagnosis or treatment of the syncope was affected by electroencephalogram in only one patient. These findings suggest that routine electroencephalography is not of significant value in the evaluation of syncope in adults.\r"

We tested this hypothesis and also studied whether sodium bicarbonate would have a similar effect. Eight healthy adults each partook of four oral regimens: aluminum alone, aluminum plus sodium bicarbonate, aluminum plus citrate (as Shohl's solution), and citrate alone. Twenty-four hour urine collections were obtained immediately preceding and during the second day of each medication period for determination of aluminum content. A significant but similar increment in urinary aluminum occurred with both aluminum alone and aluminum plus sodium bicarbonate, while only a small increment was noted with Shohl's solution alone. The rise in urinary aluminum obtained with aluminum plus Shohl's solution, however, was nearly eight times that seen with either aluminum alone or aluminum plus sodium bicarbonate (327 micrograms vs 45 micrograms and 41 micrograms, respectively). Citrate thus appears to augment gastrointestinal aluminum absorption markedly, an effect not shared by an equivalent dose of sodium bicarbonate. Citrate administration to patients with renal failure who are also taking aluminum-containing medication may be harmful.\r"

  ".W": "To identify risk factors for the development of seizures and cardiac arrhythmias after chronic, unintentional theophylline intoxication we monitored the clinical course of 72 consecutive patients referred to a regional poison center with chronic theophylline intoxication (serum theophylline concentration, greater than or equal to 167 mumol/L after protracted use). The median age of the sample was 47.5 years (range, 4 days to 91 years). Median peak theophylline concentration was 239 mumol/L, with a range of 167 to 722 mumol/L. A life-threatening event (LTE) occurred in 28 patients (39%) that included seizures in eight and a major cardiac arrhythmia in 22. The median peak (theophylline) of patients who had an LTE vs those who did not was 235.8 vs 238.7 mumol/L. However, the median age of patients with an LTE compared with those without an LTE was significantly greater (70.5 vs 18.0 years). Stratification of data by chronologic age revealed a stepwise increase in the frequency of LTE with advancing years: patients more than 75 years old had a 16.7-fold greater risk of LTE than patients less than 25 years old (95% confidence interval, 3.56, 77.5) despite comparable intergroup median serum (theophylline). These data suggest the primary determinant of LTEs after chronic theophylline intoxication is chronologic age. Elderly patients have an inordinately greater risk of LTE than younger patients. Peak serum theophylline concentration cannot predict which patients with chronic theophylline intoxication will have an LTE. Finally, these data indicate that theophylline should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in elderly patients.\r"

  ".W": "Helicobacter pylori (formerly Campylobacter pylori) is causally related to active antral gastritis and is highly associated with duodenal and gastric ulcers. However, the relationship of H pylori to nonulcer dyspepsia is less clear. We determined the presence of H pylori in unselected patients who were undergoing upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, and we found a prevalence of 37% in 110 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia that was similar to previous data. Patients with nonulcer dyspepsia who had H pylori were found to be significantly older than patients with nonulcer dyspepsia who did not have H pylori. In addition, when stratified according to age, we detected an increased prevalence of H pylori in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia with increasing age, similar to that reported for asymptomatic control populations. This finding casts doubt as to the causal role of H pylori for most patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and stresses the importance of considering epidemiologic factors, such as age, when evaluating the role of H pylori in specific disease states.\r"

If the acyclovir therapy was begun within the first 24 hours of varicella exanthem, then the rash and clinical illness were dramatically lessened.

All subjects had normal serum creatinine levels (62 to 124 mumol/L) and \"normal\" urinalysis results on entry into the study. Subjects with comorbid renal diagnoses and diabetes mellitus were eliminated from the analysis. Although not statistically significant, the rate of change in the serum creatinine concentration over time was greater in the EH cohort compared with the control cohort (1.08 +/- 4.8 vs 0.027 +/- 3.5 mumol/L per year). The difference was especially marked in black EH subjects vs black control subjects (1.60 +/- 6.2 mumol/L per year vs -0.21 +/- 3.3 mumol/L per year). When age, race, body mass index, and a diagnosis of EH were entered into a logistic regression analysis, EH subjects had a statistically significantly greater rate of decline in renal function than did control subjects (1.5 +/- 8.3 mumol/L per year). When mean time-averaged systolic blood pressure for each subject was also included in the logistic regression analysis, only systolic time-averaged blood pressure was statistically significant (0.063 +/- 0.029 mumol/L per year). We conclude that in the absence of clinically detected parenchymal renal disease, EH subjects have a greater rate of decline in renal function than do nonhypertensive subjects. Time-averaged blood pressure is predictive of the change in serum creatinine concentration not only in EH subjects but also in nonhypertensive subjects. Thus, preservation of renal function may require a blood pressure lower than the currently accepted normotensive range.\r"

The women treated with levothyroxine showed no increase in morbidity or mortality. Of the 24 women still receiving levothyroxine in 1980 and 1981, 22 had serum thyrotropin and triiodothyronine concentrations with-in reference limits. These individuals were compared with the 968 women from the population study having no history of thyroid disease, and appeared identical as to laboratory and clinical data, with the exception of a slightly higher body mass, taller stature, and lower serum cholesterol concentration. The treated group did not differ in a life quality estimate based on 19 questions regarding life satisfaction and sensory function. We conclude that the levothyroxine-treated woman suffers no side effects from her life-long therapy.\r"

During a 14-month period, we were contacted regarding eight instances of acute ingestions of liquid lead-based ceramic glazes by mentally impaired residents of nursing homes or psychiatric facilities participating in ceramic arts programs. While some ingestions did not cause toxic effects, some patients developed acute lead poisoning characterized by abdominal pain, anemia, and basophilic stippling of red blood cells. In the blood of several patients, lead concentrations were far above normal (4 to 9.5 mumol/L). Urinary lead excretions were tremendously elevated during chelation therapy, with one patient excreting 535.9 mumol/L of lead during a 6-day period, the largest lead excretion ever reported in a patient suffering from acute lead poisoning, to our knowledge. All patients recovered following supportive care and appropriate use of chelating agents. Lead-based glazes are commonly found in nursing homes and psychiatric facilities. We suspect that acute or chronic lead poisoning from the ingestion(s) of lead-based ceramic glazes may be an unrecognized but not uncommon problem among such residents. We urge physicians to take ingestions of lead-based glazes seriously and to consider the diagnosis of lead poisoning in nursing home and psychiatric patients who have participated in ceramic crafts programs.\r"

Thyrotropin levels ( +/- SEM) had decreased from 16.6 +/- 3.2 mU/L to 3.1 +/- 0.7 mU/L and 3.2 +/- 0.7 mU/L at 2 months and 4 months. At 2 months, levothyroxine treatment led to a decrease in levels of total cholesterol from 5.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (213 +/- 12 mg/dL) to 4.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (186 +/- 12 mg/dL), in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from 3.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (143 +/- 12 mg/dL) to 2.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (112 +/- 12 mg/dL), and in apolipoprotein B from 91 +/- 8 mg/dL to 74 +/- 7 mg/dL. At 4 months, levels of LDL-C and apolipoprotein B remained significantly lower than pretreatment values (2.9 +/- 0.2 mmol/L [112 +/- 8 mg/dL] and 75 +/- 6 mg/dL, respectively). While high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL3-C, and apolipoprotein A-I were not significantly affected by levothyroxine therapy, there was a slight trend of increase in HDL2-C during levothyroxine substitution. There was also a tendency for a decrease in triglyceride levels from 1.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/L (115 +/- 18 mg/dL) to 0.9 +/- 0.1 mmol/L (80 +/- 9 mg/dL) at 4 months of levothyroxine therapy. Levels of HDL-C tended to decrease from 4.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/L (186 +/- 15 mg/dL) to 4.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (174 +/- 19 mg/dL) at 2 months and to 3.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/L (151 +/- 15 mg/dL) at 4 months. The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio also decreased from 3.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (128 +/- 12 mg/dL) to 2.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (112 +/- 19 mg/dL) and 2.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (97 +/- 12 mg/dL) at 2 months and 4 months, respectively. These results suggest that long-term levothyroxine therapy in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with a decrease in LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels that are reflected in a trend of decreases in cholesterol/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios known to have a relationship with coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies of patients with hip fractures from two hospitals have suggested that the marked reduction in length of stay that occurred following implementation of the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) resulted in decreased quality of care for these patients. To assess whether this change influenced mortality, we studied patients with hip fractures aged 65 years or older from a 20% sample of Michigan Medicare enrollees. There were 2130 such patients in the 2 years preceding (October 1981 through September 1983) and 2238 in the 2 years following (October 1984 through September 1986) implementation of PPS. Although the demographic characteristics of patients with hip fractures did not change after PPS, the mean length of stay (95% confidence interval) decreased by 4.4 (4.1 to 4.7) days. However, mortality in the year following the fracture did not change: 23.2% before PPS, 23.7% after PPS; rate difference of 0.5% (-2.0 to 3.0). This finding was consistently present within subgroups defined by patient demographic characteristics. Furthermore, when the analysis was restricted to patients treated in those hospitals with the greatest reduction in average length of stay following PPS (7.5 days, or 35%), there was no significant change in 1-year mortality. For those patients who were enrolled in Medicaid and not in a nursing home at the time of the fracture, there was no increase in the rate of nursing home residence 1 year after the fracture. Thus, the findings of this population-based study suggest that the key outcomes of postfracture mortality and nursing home residence were not affected by the implementation of PPS.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen patients with malignant hypercalcemia were treated with a combination of a single dose of 3-amino 1-hydroxypropylidene-1-bisphosphonate (APD [also known as AHPrBP or palmidronate disodium]) and salmon calcitonin given as suppositories for 3 days. To assess whether such a combined short treatment has a significant benefit leading to earlier normalization of the plasma calcium level than does APD alone, 17 additional patients matched for the type of tumor, initial plasma calcium level, urinary hydroxyproline level, and the dose of APD served as controls. All patients receiving the combination of calcitonin and APD achieved normalization of the plasma calcium level within 9 days, with a decrease from 3.22 +/- 0.90 mmol/L (mean +/- SEM) to 2.29 +/- 0.03 mmol/L. In the group receiving APD alone, the plasma calcium level normalized in only 14 of 17 patients by day 9. In the group receiving calcitonin and APD, the drop in the plasma calcium level occurred more rapidly, and the plasma calcium values were lower from days 2 to 4. This advantage was explained by the calciuric effect of calcitonin, as reflected by a significant decrease in the notional setting of renal reabsorption of calcium, reaching 2.16 +/- 0.06 mmol/L compared with 2.34 +/- 0.06 mmol/L in the group receiving APD alone. There were no side effects of both treatments, in particular neither flushing nor nausea induced by the suppositories of calcitonin. Clinical Improvement occurred after 2 days in the group receiving the combined treatment. In conclusion, the combined treatment is rapidly effective and safe in the treatment of patients with hypercalcemia, particularly when the notional setting of renal tubular reabsorption of calcium is increased and a rapid correction of the plasma calcium level is needed.\r"

In a hypothetical outpatient teaching encounter, the interactions between the patient, resident, and attending physician are dissected to reveal missed opportunities to teach and to explore alternative approaches to the educational process. These approaches include promoting the resident's role as the primary provider, developing a limited teaching agenda for each teaching encounter, focusing on the learner rather than on the diagnostic dilemma posed by the patient, and using questions, role modeling and observation with feedback to promote learning.\r"

Nine neonates were thrombocytopenic, with a platelet count of less than 50 x 10(9)/L in eight. Four of these nine neonates delivered to a subgroup of 31 mothers were studied prospectively; the frequency of thrombocytopenia in neonates of women with immune thrombocytopenic purpura was thus 13%. Only two of these nine neonates presented with hemorrhagic syndromes (two, petechial purpura; one, intracranial bleeding). The frequency of neonatal thrombocytopenia was higher in mothers with deep thrombocytopenia and in those who had not responded to corticosteroid treatment following diagnosis. No prognostic value could be assigned to the other maternal characteristics studied, such as a history of splenectomy, maternal treatment at the time of delivery, or the presence of platelet autoantibodies evaluated either with the platelet immunofluorescence test or the platelet Western blot immunoassay.\r"

Patients who were colonized with MRSA received 2 weeks of either regimen. The study was terminated after the enrollment of 21 subjects due to the recognition of ciprofloxacin resistance in 10 of 21 new MRSA isolates during the last 2 months of the study. Five of the 10 patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA isolates had never received ciprofloxacin. Long-term (6-month) eradication had been achieved in only three of 11 ciprofloxacin plus rifampin and four of 10 sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim plus rifampin recipients. The use of this new fluoroquinolone for the eradication of MRSA colonization is usually not effective and may risk the development of ciprofloxacin resistance in MRSA within the hospital environment.\r"

Subjects were referred for complete ophthalmologic evaluation if they failed the vision test or met other \"high-risk\" criteria based on information contained in the questionnaire. Patient-initiated requests for eye examinations were also honored. A total of 169 patients were scheduled for eye examinations, and 148 actually underwent ophthalmologic evaluation. One hundred one of those examined were referred on the basis of the study criteria. \"Serious eye disease\" (cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or age-related macular degeneration) was diagnosed in 96 (95%) of these patients. Prompt surgical intervention was recommended in 27 (27%), and medical treatment was begun in 21 (21%). Of those with serious eye disease, 59% met the criteria by failing the vision test, while 69% met the high-risk criteria determined by the questionnaire. Of the 148 subjects who received ophthalmologic evaluations, 47 requested them. Serious eye disease was diagnosed in 23 (50%) of the 47 patients. None of these individuals required immediate surgery, and medical treatment for glaucoma was begun in eight (17%). These data suggest that screening for serious eye disease in a primary care setting is an efficient mechanism to use for the identification of patients with undetected ocular disorders that require follow-up or treatment.\r"

There were 12 spontaneous pneumothoraces in this group of patients. Seventy-five percent of patients with pneumothorax had roentgenographic evidence of fibrocystic lung parenchyma and clinical evidence of active Pneumocystis pneumonia. The majority (83%) required chest tube evacuation. There was a 50% mortality rate associated with this complication.

We examined these deaths in the active treatment arms of the two trials to determine if there were some readily explainable causes or if the cholesterol-lowering agents might be a factor. Our examination showed that the two homicides were victims, not offenders, and one had stopped treatment because of myocardial infarction 1 year before his death. Five of the eight suicides had dropped out of the trials and had not taken the cholesterol-lowering drugs for periods of months to years prior to committing suicide. Of the 10 deaths due to accidents, two were dropouts from the trials, three others had high blood alcohol concentrations detectable at autopsy, and another three reported a history of psychiatric symptoms and/or treatment prior to entry. When dropouts and known risk factors for these deaths such as alcohol intoxication and psychiatric histories are considered, little evidence remains to support the hypothesis that cholesterol-lowering drugs are causally associated with deaths due to homicides, suicides, and accidents in these trials.\r"

Evidence of T-cell activation was present in peripheral blood and affected tissues during the clinically active progressive phase of disease. Among other manifestations pleural effusion, cutaneous vasculitis, joint contractures, and bloody diarrhea were observed.

One of the well-known hypersensitivity reactions to this agent is the \"red-man syndrome,\" which is believed to involve drug-induced histamine release in certain individuals. Although rate and/or dose reductions may be effective in some cases, some hypersensitivity reactions necessitate the discontinuation of vancomycin. In this article one patient is described who developed vancomycin-associated reactions consistent with the red-man syndrome despite having tolerated vancomycin administration previously. This case was managed by sequential increments in vancomycin administration over several days that allowed for therapeutic doses of the drug to be administered. Prior to desensitization, vancomycin administration at a lowered rate and dose was unsuccessfully attempted, despite the presence of combination antihistamine therapy. A loss of skin prick test reactivity to vancomycin was demonstrated after successful desensitization. This desensitization method may be useful in managing certain refractory cases of vancomycin hypersensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effect of abrupt discontinuation of therapeutic doses of short half-life and long half-life benzodiazepines in 57 benzodiazepine-dependent patients (daily use, greater than 1 year). Despite the use of a mean daily dose of 14.1 mg of diazepam equivalents, there were notable residual symptoms of anxiety and depression present at intake (Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score, 17.0; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, 14.0). Benzodiazepine intake was stabilized for 3 weeks before double-blind assignment to placebo (n = 47), or continued benzodiazepine use (n = 10). Clinical assessments were performed daily, including benzodiazepine plasma levels. Depending on the outcome criteria used, anywhere from 58% to 100% of patients were judged to have experienced a withdrawal reaction, with a peak severity at 2 days for short half-life and 4 to 7 days for long half-life benzodiazepines. Relapse onto benzodiazepines occurred in 27% of patients who were receiving long half-life benzodiazepines and in 57% of patients who were receiving short half-life benzodiazepines. Baseline predictors of relapse were nonpanic diagnoses, a higher benzodiazepine dose, and a higher Eysenck neuroticism score. A short half-life and higher daily doses were associated with greater withdrawal severity, as were personality traits, such as dependency and neuroticism, less education and higher baseline levels of anxious and depressive symptoms. Patients who were able to remain free of benzodiazepines for at least 5 weeks obtained lower levels of anxiety than before benzodiazepine discontinuation. These results provide a detailed picture of the symptoms, time course, and multidimensional determinants of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.\r"

Nonetheless, 32% of long half-life and 42% of short half-life benzodiazepine-treated patients were unable to achieve a drug-free state. The most difficulty was experienced in the last half of taper. Baseline personality, high Eysenck neuroticism, female sex, and mild-to-moderate alcohol use were found to be more significant predictors of withdrawal severity than the daily benzodiazepine dose or benzodiazepine half-life. These findings suggest that personality factors contribute significantly to the patient's difficulties with gradual benzodiazepine discontinuation of therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines.\r"

Subjective anxiety responses after flumazenil infusion were significantly higher in the patient group with panic disorder than in the controls, and eight patients with panic disorder but no controls had panic attacks. This anxiogenic effect of flumazenil in the patients argues against the presence of endogenous anxiogenic (inverse agonist) ligands. Possible explanations include the differential production of an anxiolytic endogenous ligand or an altered benzodiazepine receptor \"set-point.\" Such an abnormality may contribute to the pathogenesis of panic disorder.\r"

In the first group of 11 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder studied using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, treatment with fluoxetine for 10 weeks was found to produce therapeutic effects similar to treatment with clomipramine for 10 weeks. There were significantly fewer total side effects reported during fluoxetine than clomipramine treatment. Drug tapering and placebo substitution in the 4-week crossover interval phase led to substantial relapses in obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms and depression. Furthermore, responses to the second drug took as long to occur as responses to the first drug, although both drugs are thought to act by a common mechanism, serotonin uptake inhibition. A second group of 21 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder that had been previously stabilized on clomipramine treatment with at least partial benefit were crossed over to fluoxetine treatment in a double-blind fashion. After 10 weeks of fluoxetine administration, most patients manifested behavioral rating scores of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depressive symptoms that were comparable with precrossover ratings completed during clomipramine treatment. A significant exacerbation in obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression ratings as well as a similar lag in therapeutic efficacy were also noted in this second cohort of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Platelet 5-HT concentrations were reduced 95% during both clomipramine and fluoxetine treatment periods. These results suggest that fluoxetine may represent a viable alternative to clomipramine in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, although further studies with larger sample sizes are needed.\r"

Since their response to phenelzine appears to be unique, this suggests that atypical depression may be a distinct subgroup of unipolar depressive illness. Unexpectedly, the benefit of antidepressants was limited to patients who also had spontaneous panic attacks. To help establish the validity of this syndrome, a new sample of 90 atypical depressives was studied. The clinical and demographic characteristics of the original and replication sample were virtually identical at baseline. In addition, the treatment response with either placebo, imipramine, or phenelzine was also indistinguishable in the two patient groups. The outcome in the replication study supports the hypothesis that this may be a distinct unipolar depressive subgroup. In the replication sample, a history of panic attacks did not appear to be a relevant predictor. We discuss the explanations for this discrepancy in the two patient samples.\r"

The HLA-B38 phenotype was found in 83% of patients who developed agranulocytosis and in 20% of clozapine-treated patients who did not develop agranulocytosis. Because B38 is part of a haplotype known to occur frequently in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, the frequencies of the combined alleles HLA-B38, DR4, and DQw3 were examined. The incidence of HLA-B38, DR4, DQw3 was significantly increased in patients with agranulocytosis (five of five patients) compared with control patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (two of 17 patients). These findings indicate that genetic factors marked by major histocompatibility complex haplotypes may be associated with the susceptibility of Jewish schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine to develop agranulocytosis. We postulate that gene products contained in the haplotype may be involved in mediating drug toxicity.\r"

Compared with a control group of patients who accepted prescribed antipsychotic treatment, the 103 patients who refused were older, of a higher social class, and less likely to have been prescribed antiparkinsonian medications. On admission, prior to refusal of medication, patients who refused were found to have significantly higher Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores than compliant patients and more negative attitudes regarding their hospitalization and past, present, and future treatment. Treatment refusal had negative effects on the hospital milieu and on the patient; refusers were more likely to require seclusion or restraint and had longer hospitalizations than treatment acceptors. Most refusal episodes ended with voluntary acceptance of treatment. In 23% of cases medications were discontinued. Only 18% of the sample reached formal, judicial review, and in every case that did, involuntary treatment was ordered. The policy implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

No significant changes were noted in cerebrospinal fluid levels of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, homovanillic acid, or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. No consistent or significant group mean changes were observed in structured behavioral ratings, although 9 (75%) of the volunteers studied reported mild behavioral changes while receiving prednisone.

However, many critical issues confronting nosologists are fundamentally nonempirical and cannot be addressed by the scientific method. Examples of such issues include (1) disagreements about the proper construct for a psychiatric disorder; (2) the interpretation of results when different validators provide opposing answers; (3) defining how different syndromes must be to be considered subtypes of the same disorder, distinct disorders within the same overall category, or entirely independent disorders; and (4) the proper balance of reliability and validity. The optimal use of the scientific method in our nosologic process requires a recognition of both its strengths and its limitations.\r"

First, we evaluated the financial impact of a rapid, monoclonal antibody-based CK-MB mass assay (Stratus, Dade Division, Baxter Laboratories, Miami, Fla) for the direct measurement of CK-MB in serum samples from 65 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with the possible diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Second, we evaluated retrospectively the Stratus assay and an activity assay (electrophoresis) for CK-MB in the following patient categories: acute myocardial infarction treated with and without thrombolytic therapy, angina, congestive heart failure, skeletal muscle trauma, and the acutely ill without acute myocardial infarction. The advantageous features of the Stratus mass assay were as follows. First, the laboratory was able to perform the assay more frequently because of the short assay time per specimen (less than 10 minutes) without additional personnel. This had a substantial impact on the clinician's ability to diagnose acute myocardial infarction and to move patients out of an intensive care unit at substantial financial savings to the patient, the hospital, or the third-party payer. Second, the Stratus assay was able to detect low levels of CK-MB (1 to 2 micrograms/L) in the presence of low total creatine kinase activity (less than 100 U/L). Third, the Stratus assay showed no interference due to very-high-total creatine kinase activities (greater than 100,000 U/L), CK-BB, macro-creatine kinase, and mitochondrial creatine kinase.\r"

The significant degree of correlation between the percentage of large unstained cells and morphoimmunophenotypic diagnosis, although obtained for a relatively small number of cases, suggests that this method of cell volume analysis can be used to improve diagnostic reproducibility in chronic B-cell leukemia.\r"

The findings were correlated with results of in situ hybridization with biotin-labeled human papillomavirus DNA probes. Moderate nuclear atypia was significantly more specific than perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing and 100% sensitive for predicting cases positive for human papillomavirus. Of the various morphological features analyzed, perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing had the lowest specificity for predicting positive results on in situ hybridization.\r"

In another man, an irregularly shaped, grossly depressed lesion indicating a malignancy was present at the gastric angle, and 6 years later he agreed to a partial gastrectomy. The lesion proved to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma confined to the mucosa. Retrospective examination of the original biopsy specimen revealed a small area of adenocarcinoma, presumably overlooked at the initial examination. Thus, some gastric carcinomas of the well-differentiated type can grow at an extremely slow rate, without extensive spread or invasion. Findings in these cases contribute to knowledge of the biological behavior of gastric carcinomas.\r"

The UBB cells had nuclei with features reminiscent of papillary carcinoma nuclei in that they were enlarged, oval, and contained finely dispersed chromatin when compared with follicular cell nuclei. Both papillary carcinomas and UBB remnants are common, occur as tiny, solid, or cystic thyroid entities in patients of all ages, may contain papillary structures, and share some common nuclear features. Therefore, it is important to include UBB remnants in the differential diagnosis of minute thyroid entities and to recognize their morphologic features.\r"

Sudden death occurred in 14 children and adults; seven of these patients had a history of atrioventricular block or syncope. Three tumors were incidental findings in infants with other congenital anomalies; diaphragmatic agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and Meckel's diverticulum in one patient; mitral atresia in one; and congenital hydrocephalus, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, and patent omphalovitelline duct in the third. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated strong positivity for carcinoembryonic antigen in 13 of 13 cases, B72.3 antigen in 5 of 7 cases, and cytokeratin in 11 of 11 cases. Twenty control cases of mesothelioma and mesothelial hyperplasia were all negative for B72.3; one showed focal carcinoembryonic antigen staining. Ultrastructural analysis of one case demonstrated short rudimentary microvilli not characteristic of mesothelial cells. We conclude that so-called mesotheliomas of the atrioventricular nodal region are not of mesothelial origin, because of strong carcinoembryonic antigen positivity and occasional positivity with B72.3, as these antibodies react with glycoproteins found in endodermally derived tissue and generally not with mesothelial tissue. Conduction system tumors are most likely congenital rests of endodermal origin, can be associated with other congenital anomalies, and often cause symptoms of heart block and sudden death.\r"

Pulmonary arteries less than 100 microns in external diameter were identified and the external diameter, medial thickness, and intimal thickness were quantitatively measured in the lung tissues of 57 coal miners and 15 control subjects with and without other chronic lung diseases. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, emphysema, and right ventricular hypertrophy were assessed uniformly in all cases. The arterial wall thickness correlated with right ventricular hypertrophy, progressive massive fibrosis, and other chronic lung diseases. Severity of emphysema also showed a weak correlation. Although the functional significance of these findings is not known, we conclude that the muscularization of pulmonary arterioles provides a structural basis for the development of right ventricular hypertrophy in coal miners.\r"

A computed tomographic scan revealed a large vascular mass in the left parieto-occipital region and a small lesion in the left frontal lobe. The placenta was expelled during the delivery and was not examined. In view of the high level of maternal human chorionic gonadotropic hormone and the autopsy finding of metastasis, we presumed that the mass was a metastatic choriocarcinoma that had originated in the maternal placenta. To our knowledge, only one previous instance of this phenomenon has been reported.\r"

  ".W": "This study determined the physiologic responses to prolonged functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) leg-cycle exercise in seven quadriplegic and seven paraplegic subjects. Each subject completed 30 minutes of continuous FNS leg cycling during which open-circuit spirometry, impedance cardiography, auscultation, and fingertip capillary blood sampling were used to assess metabolic and hemodynamic responses. Compared with resting values, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), pulmonary ventilation, heart rate (HR), left ventricular stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (Qt), and blood lactate (La) concentration were significantly (p less than .05) elevated, whereas plasma volume, bicarbonate concentration, and pH were significantly decreased in both groups during prolonged FNS leg-cycle exercise. Mean arterial pressure remained unchanged in quadriplegic and paraplegic subjects during the prolonged FNS leg-cycle exercise bout. Persons with quadriplegia elicited significantly lower MAP and tended to have lower SV and Qt responses than persons with paraplegia, probably due to a higher degree of sympathetic dysfunction and circulatory hypokinesis during FNS leg-cycle exercise. All other physiologic variables responded similarly between groups. We speculate that the relative increases observed for HR (33% to 60%), SV (45% to 69%), and Qt (113% to 142%) during prolonged FNS leg-cycle exercise create a sufficient cardiac-volume load to promote central cardiovascular conditioning in persons with both quadriplegia and paraplegia. The La accumulation (4.7 to 5.2 mmol.L-1) in the spinal cord injured during prolonged FNS leg cycling is unusually high for the power output attained (5.2W and 6.1W for quadriplegia and paraplegia, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Incapacity Status Scale, Environmental Status Scale, and the Barthel Index had high intercorrelations with each other. Although each was predictive of the MS subject's physical care needs, the FIM was the most useful. A change in total FIM score of one point was equivalent to an average of 3.38 minutes of help from another person per day. With the Brief Symptom Inventory and the Environmental Status Scale, the FIM contributed to predicting the patient's general satisfaction as well. We propose that burden of care and subjective satisfaction with life be the standards by which functional assessment instruments are compared to reflect, in pragmatic terms, the impact of disability on the lives of individuals and on the human and economic resources of the community.\r"

Therapy emphasized instruction in motor planning, balance and weight shift, and the use of adaptive equipment; these motor abilities were then practiced within real life situations. The patients demonstrated significant improvement in the outcome measures of weight shift, balance, and ADL scores after the one-month rehabilitation program (weight shift: F = 16.1, p = .0001; balance: F = 6.26, p = .0007; ADL: F = 13.8, p = .0001).

Data from 96% of these patients were used retrospectively to create a mathematic model, based on multiple linear regression, that predicts the patient's total rehabilitation length of stay (LOS). The model requires only information about the patient's admitting diagnosis, referral source, admission functional status, and date of admission. The model compared favorably with prospective estimates of LOS made independently by attending physicians at admission to rehabilitation. We conclude that such models could be used to facilitate management of rehabilitation units, forecast patient census, schedule unit personnel, set interim goals for LOS, and facilitate discharge planning. The delivery of rehabilitation services, like the delivery of other medical services, can be defined in part by objective, measurable patient characteristics.\r"

These subjects were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. A group of able-bodied subjects also participated. A joint-movement tracking test (JMTT) quantified control of active finger extension movement at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger within the available range of active movement, and a force tracking test (FTT) quantified control of isometric finger extension force at the same joint within the subject's available force range. Electromyographic activity was monitored in the extensor digitorum and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles during both tracking tests. Manual stretch was applied to the extrinsic finger flexor muscles of the experimental group between the pretest and posttest tracking tests. The JMTT performances of both control (p less than .025) and experimental (p less than .05) groups were significantly subnormal on the pretest as were FTT performances of controls (p less than .01) and study subjects (p less than .03). The JMTT improvement on posttest was significantly greater (p less than .05) in subjects than in controls. However, the change in FTT performance was not significantly different between the two groups. Manual stretch treatment, properly applied to extrinsic finger flexor muscles, is an effective method of temporarily improving the control of finger extension movement in spastic hemiparetic subjects.\r"

Twenty-one (87.6%) subjects were living at home; three were living in nursing homes. Fourteen (70%) of 20 subjects who received bilateral prostheses were ambulators. At interview, the mean age was 75.2 years; 4.87 years was the mean time since the second amputation. Ten (50%) subjects remained ambulatory. Among the other ten who received prosthesis, loss of ambulation occurred mostly due to medical factors, at an average of 3.47 years after the second amputation. Those no longer ambulatory were older and \"sicker,\" and the interval between amputations was shorter. Fifteen (62.5%) subjects were independent in dressing, 14 (58.4%) in toileting, and only nine (33.3%) in bathing. All but one subject required housekeeping assistance. The anticipated effect on function of environmental and socioeconomic factors could not be demonstrated in this sample. Survival time and retention of ambulatory skills for an average of nine years after the second amputation in eight (33.3%) subjects who died before the end of the study was longer than previously described. The high rate of success in rehabilitation and in maintenance of ambulatory skills fully justifies intensive restorative efforts for this group of amputees.\r"

We measured torque in the right knee extensors of 17 able-bodied subjects during an isometric contraction for 60sec at 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of maximal effort. During contractions, a 0.5-sec train of 50-Hz stimulation was applied at 15, 30, and 45sec. We measured the percent decline in force over 60 sec (fatigue index) and average augmentation in torque during stimulation (AVAUGTORQ). The mean fatigue index at full effort was 25.1%. The mean AVAUGTORQ at 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of maximal effort was 12.1%, 26.3%, 40.5%, and 69.7% of values at complete relaxation, respectively. These methods should be clinically useful for quantifying the level of isometric fatigue, determining the site of fatigue, and measuring the level of effort in subjects without neuromuscular disease. The results agree with previous studies reporting a peripheral site of fatigue in healthy, well-motivated subjects.\r"

Biomechanical accommodations in gait caused by high-heeled shoes varied between younger and older individuals and between experienced and inexperienced wearers of high-heeled shoes. Younger subjects tended to increase lordosis of the trunk at heelstrike during high-heeled gait (1.7 degrees, SD = 0.8 degrees), whereas older subjects tended to flatten the trunk (-3.7 degrees, SD = 4.7 degrees, p less than .05). Experienced wearers had much greater increases in knee flexion during stance phase of high-heeled gait (5.3 degrees, SD = 3.3 degrees) than inexperienced wearers (1.9 degrees, SD = 1.9 degrees, p less than .05). Exaggerated upper trunk rotations were found in older and inexperienced subject groups rather than younger, and experienced groups (p less than .05).\r"

It was used in the long-term administration of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) by 18 patients with paralytic or restrictive pulmonary insufficiency. This interface is an acrylic shell which is firmly fixed to an orthodontic bite plate; it is designed to form a seal over the nose and mouth for the entry of IPPV. Eight patients were ventilator dependent 24 hours a day. The ten patients who required only nocturnal aid had improvement in daytime arterial blood gases. Although nine of these patients could manage less than 15 minutes of unassisted breathing (free time) supine, all slept supine on SONI IPPV. The 13 patients who underwent sleep monitoring maintained a mean oxygen saturation of 95.3% +/- 1.7% and acceptable end-tidal pCO2 (30 to 45 mmHg). These 13 patients have used SONI IPPV for an average of 22 months (range = 3 to 63 months). Impediments to successful long-term use of a SONI include the presence of a hyperactive gag reflex or stimulation of excessive oral secretions. When combined with mouth IPPV, glossopharyngeal breathing, the intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator, or the cuirass ventilator for daytime use, SONI IPPV is an option for the patient who prefers total ventilatory support by noninvasive means.\r"

Three areas dealing with conceptual and methodologic issues--depression, neurochemical interventions, and family--are highlighted.

  ".W": "Achieving reduced mortality rates in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and pancreatic abscess is possible by employing a comprehensive management plan. Components of the plan include (1) rapid evaluation and assessment of the degree of physiologic and anatomic derangement, the latter by the prompt use of vascular enhanced computed tomographic scan; (2) adequate fluid resuscitation determined by early institution of advanced hemodynamic monitoring; (3) attempts to identify and document septic foci via computed tomography-guided percutaneous aspiration; and (4) aggressive surgical debridement. Close adherence to these policies allowed us to keep mortality in this seriously ill group of patients to 14%. Most deaths occurred in patients who were referred to this service late in the course of their disease. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Enquiry (APACHE) II severity of illness index applied at the time of admission proved an accurate predictor of mortality. A score of 25 or greater was highly predictive of death, and a lesser score, of survival.\r"

  ".W": "A rational approach to the local treatment of intraductal breast cancer continues to generate considerable debate. However, the finding of an invasive component in intraductal breast cancer is widely regarded as an appropriate indication for axillary node dissection as part of the local treatment and staging of this disease. Despite this view, the natural history of patients with intraductal breast cancer with foci of microinvasion is poorly defined. Between 1965 and 1988, 41 patients with this pathologic finding of intraductal carcinoma with foci of microinvasion were seen at the UCLA Medical Center. Twenty-three patients presented with mammographic abnormalities, while 17 patients presented with a palpable mass. One patient presented with Paget's disease of the nipple. Thirty-three patients underwent axillary node dissection as part of their local treatment. No lymph node metastases were identified. The median follow-up in 37 patients was 47 months. There have been no local recurrences and no deaths from recurrent breast cancer. Intraductal breast cancer associated with microinvasion appears to be an extremely favorable lesion with minimal risk of nodal metastases.\r"

The incidences of infection, seroma, hematoma, and epidermolysis were compared among 395 patients (305 with modified radical mastectomies and 90 with mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction) from Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, Wash, between 1983 and 1989. Obesity, age (60 years or older), smoking, antibiotics, and wound drainage were examined as possible risk factors. There were more wound complications in the modified radical mastectomy group (48% vs 31%), and specifically, more seromas (30% vs 13%). In the modified radical mastectomy group, age of 60 years or older was associated with seroma and infection, drainage greater than 30 mL per day (at time of drain removal) with seroma, and smoking with epidermolysis. In the mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction group, obesity was associated with seroma and epidermolysis. We conclude that mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction appears to be as safe as modified radical mastectomy alone with respect to wound complications.\r"

Eight patients had a significant hyperchloremic acidemia in association with infusion of the hypertonic solutions, but all eight were moribund before infusion and many factors other than hyperchloremia could have contributed to their acidemia. Other blood chemistry changes that might have been associated with the hypertonic solutions, such as hyperosmolality or hypernatremia, were made insignificant by other factors, such as high blood alcohol levels or concomitant administration of sodium bicarbonate. There were no cases of central pontine myelinolysis; bleeding was not potentiated. There was no difficulty with crossmatching of blood. No anaphylactoid reactions occurred. In a setting of limited volume resuscitation, the solutions are likely to have a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio.\r"

There were 42 perforations and 20 devascularizations; multiple injuries were common (27%). Abdominal tenderness was present on admission in 43 of 44 patients in whom a reliable examination was possible. Peritoneal lavage was positive in 13 (93%) of 14 patients. Computed tomography was falsely negative in three of four instances in which it was used. Perforations were most common in the upper and lower ends of the small bowel and in the sigmoid colon; devascularizations were most common in the distal ileum and sigmoid colon. Resection/anastomosis was performed in 38% of small-bowel perforations and in all small-bowel devascularizations. Resection/diversion was required in most colonic perforations (five of six patients) and devascularizations (four of six patients). There were five deaths (9%), none due to intestinal injury. There were seven complications related to intestinal injury. Diagnostic delay occurred in two patients; both had resultant morbidity. Blunt intestinal injury is associated with physical findings in conscious patients. Peritoneal lavage should be used when tenderness cannot be evaluated. Timely operative intervention minimizes morbidity and hospital stay.\r"

One patient with parathyroid hyperplasia developed permanent hypocalcemia. None had permanent vocal cord paralysis and none required tracheostomy. Thorough visual inspection and palpation of the entire thyroid gland should be performed during operations for hyperparathyroidism. Incidentally discovered thyroid nodules should prompt formal lobectomy with frozen section diagnosis; unanticipated thyroid malignancies should then be treated as independent entities. Treating simultaneous hyperparathyroidism and nodular thyroid disease with a single operation can be done safely; it avoids the expense and risk associated with neck reexploration and can detect unsuspected cancers.\r"

The limb preservation rate was 88%; there were 13 amputations. The fracture-dislocated knee injury and close-range shotgun blasts were particularly limb threatening. In general, the trauma system achieved rapid evaluation of injuries and early operative intervention. All 13 patients who underwent amputations presented with signs of severe ischemia. Concomitant injuries to the popliteal vein, tibial nerves, and soft tissue were significantly more frequent in patients who underwent amputations. The importance of complete fasciotomy for compartment hypertension, early reconstructive management of soft-tissue injuries, and expeditious arterial repair, frequently without preoperative roentgenographic suite arteriography, is emphasized. An aggressive, multidisciplinary approach is required to achieve a functional extremity when popliteal vascular trauma occurs.\r"

Clinical variables and 10 defined objective characteristics of computed tomography were evaluated. Twenty-five men and five women with abdominal aortic aneurysms ranging from 30 to 64 mm (mean, 45 mm) were followed up with serial computed tomographic scans for a mean (+/- SE) of 26 +/- 3 months. In 19 patients, enlargement of aneurysm diameter of 3 mm or more on serial computed tomographic scans was noted, whereas in 11, there was little or no expansion. Of the clinical variables studied, only serum cholesterol correlated with an increased risk of expansion. Thrombus area, measured by computed tomography, was 7.3 +/- 0.9 cm2 in enlarging aneurysms vs 4.3 +/- 0.9 cm2 in stable aneurysms. Based on these preliminary data, we conclude that computed tomography may provide valuable information about the likelihood of future expansion of small abdominal aortic aneurysms.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients admitted to our emergency department with ruptured thoracic aortas during a 15-year period to determine the reason for this persistently high morbidity and mortality and to identify any factors that might improve the outcome. We found that patients who are in unstable condition on arrival in the emergency department or who become unstable before reaching the operating room are not likely to survive. Patients who are injured in automobile accidents have a greater chance of survival than do those injured in motorcycle accidents or car-pedestrian accidents. Patients who are in hemodynamically stable condition after aortic injury survive only if diagnosis and treatment are prompt. Major complications of repair following thoracic aortic injury relate primarily to the length of cross-clamp time, and every effort should be devoted to keeping the cross-clamp time less than 30 minutes.\r"

We inspected 32 grafts (seven aortobifemoral, 18 infrainguinal bypass, and seven dialysis access fistula grafts) in 32 patients. Thirty-one patients had thrombotic events and one patient had an acute embolus. Angioscopy following standard catheter thrombectomy revealed significant amounts of retained thrombus or neointima in all thrombectomies. Angioscopic information from 18 patients with an infrainguinal bypass graft led to graft revision in six cases and placement of a new graft in 10 cases. One graft limb was replaced in seven aortobifemoral grafts, and multiple repeated thrombectomies were employed to extract debris in the remaining six cases. Repeated graft thrombectomy was also beneficial in dialysis access fistulas. Angioscopy allowed us to omit the completion angiogram and led to an improved technical result. We conclude that angioscopy is useful during thromboembolectomy procedures.\r"

Group 1 received no further treatment. Groups 2 and 3 had the adhesion models covered with fibrinogen from fresh frozen plasma (1.77 g/L) and cryoprecipitate (23.6 g/L), respectively. In group 1, 13 of 15 rats had high-grade adhesions in both models. In group 2, high-grade adhesions were noted in nine of 15 rats in model 1 and in 12 of 15 rats in model 2. In group 3, however, high-grade adhesions were seen in only three of 15 rats in model 1, with 11 rats having no adhesions, and in only two of 15 rats in model 2. Histologic analysis suggested accelerated healing in group 3. We conclude that (1) fibrin glue inhibits intra-abdominal adhesion formation in rats, (2) the inhibitory action is dependent on the fibrinogen concentration of the fibrin glue, and (3) adhesions are reduced by fibrin glue regardless of whether the peritoneal defect is closed.\r"

Of the patients, 44% had solitary lesions. Overall 3-year survival was 62.6%, and 5-year survival was 48.2%. In all primary tumors except melanoma and breast cancer, 3-year survival was greater than 50% and 5-year survival was greater than 40%. With rare exceptions, the operation of choice for unilateral lesions was ipsilateral thoracotomy, and for bilateral lesions it was median sternotomy. Adequate conservative resection was the rule. There were three pneumonectomies, 25 lobectomies, 71 single wedge resections, 38 multiple unilateral wedge resections, and 47 bilateral wedge resections. There were no postoperative hospital deaths. Cox covariate analysis demonstrated improved survival in patients whose largest lesion was less than 1.5 cm in diameter and with disease-free interval longer than 1 year, but survival was not related to number of lesions or age of patient. An aggressive surgical approach is justified in patients with most primary tumors and a limited number of lung metastases less than 1.5 cm in diameter. Resection of metastases from melanoma and breast cancer should be accomplished after other sites of metastatic disease have been ruled out by the most stringent criteria.\r"

The most frequent sites of occurrence was the pelvis (67%), followed by the axilla (14%), neck (14%), groin (3%), abdomen (2%), and mediastinum (less than 1%). The tissue seen is site-specific and frequently resembles a neighboring organ. Three cases have been reported in which heterotopic tissue was mistaken for metastatic disease.

  ".W": "Patients who undergo surgery for morbid obesity are often subjected to reoperation for a wide array of indications. To evaluate outcome following revisional procedures, we reviewed the records of 32 such patients treated at UCLA between April 1986 and May 1989. Twenty-five women (78%) and 7 men (22%) with a mean age of 44 years underwent 76 reoperations (2.4 per patient) for complications of prior obesity surgery. Indications for initial surgical revision consisted primarily of metabolic derangements (12 patients) and weight-related problems (11 patients). In contrast, indications for the patients' final surgical procedure were commonly for bowel obstruction (41%), intra-abdominal sepsis (12%), and gastrointestinal bleeding (6%). Following initial revision, 23 patients (71.8%) required further surgery for major complications and four patients died (12.5%). While initial revisions are frequently indicated for metabolic problems, final reoperations are more frequently undertaken for urgent, life-threatening complications. Revisional procedures for morbid obesity should be carefully considered, and the potential for major complications and/or death should be weighted heavily against proposed benefits.\r"

DNA from blood mononuclear cells was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction utilizing three different oligonucleotide primer pairs. Two of these primer pairs detect sequences shared between HTLV-I and HTLV-II in either p24, gag protein, or in p21, env transmembrane protein. The third primer pair was synthesized based on regions in the pol gene where amino acid sequences are conserved between HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and the related bovine leukemia virus. The multiple sclerosis samples were consistently negative while appropriate control samples were positive. We conclude that viruses related to HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or bovine leukemia virus are not present in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis and, therefore, that HTLV-bovine leukemia virus-related viruses are not likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.\r"

The other six patients had tracheal tubes open to room air. The patients given apneic oxygenation had little or no hypoxia by the end of the test. The patients given room air during the test became hypoxic. Many neurologists perform apnea tests with no oxygenation or with preoxygenation alone. This is the first prospective controlled study (to our knowledge) of apneic oxygenation; it shows that preoxygenation alone does not prevent hypoxia during apnea tests for brain death. We recommend that all apnea tests be performed with apneic oxygenation.\r"

Geographic and temporal patterns of incidence were associated with socioeconomic status but not with geochemical factors. The risk of parkinsonism-dementia complex in susceptible sibships was much higher than that in the general population--even in districts with the highest incidence rates, but especially in districts with the lowest incidence rates. Our evidence tends to support the hypothesis that multiple factors linked to cycad use play an important role in the cause of PDC. Hypotheses related to metal exposure and simple genetic factors were unsatisfactory explanations for the epidemiologic patterns observed.\r"

Thrombin activity was measured using assays for fibrinopeptide A and fibrin D-dimer. Increased fibrinopeptide A was found in 9 (11.5%) of 78 patients acutely and 6 (10.7%) of 56 at follow-up; fibrin D-dimer levels were significantly increased acutely (166 +/- 188 ng/mL; n = 66) but not at follow-up. Fibrinolytic activity was measured using assays for fibrinopeptide B-beta 1-42 and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. Fibrinopeptide B-beta 1-42 was significantly reduced acutely (6.3 +/- 2.2 pmol/mL; n = 35) and at follow-up (4.8 +/- 1.5 pmol/mL; n = 21). Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 was normal acutely (20.1 +/- 12.0 ng/mL; n = 73) but increased at follow-up (27.8 +/- 20.1 ng/mL; n = 45). These results demonstrate that patients with cerebral ischemia have abnormal hemostatic function that is not explained by the acute phase reaction, and that components of the prethrombotic state are present in some of these patients.\r"

Orientals had the lowest prevalence of vascular risk factors. Despite these differences in risk factors, multivariate analysis showed race to be an independent and strong predictor of the location of cerebrovascular lesions. To our knowledge, this study is unique in documenting risk factors prospectively and systematically in three racial groups simultaneously. Although generalization is limited by possible biases related to patient selection, the results affirm previous tentative conclusions about the role of race in determining the location of cerebrovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "We examined 29 patients with strictly subcortical large striatocapsular infarctions. Eight of them had aphasia or neglect. All patients underwent transcranial Doppler ultrasonography or selective carotid angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single photon emission tomography for assessment of cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and cerebral perfusion reserve. The signs were compatible with cortical territorial infarctions rather than lacunes. On both magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scans, the lesions corresponded to the territories of the medial and lateral group of the lenticulostriate arteries, Heubner's artery, or the anterior choroidal artery. The infarctions were either due to cerebral embolization into the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery or due to stenosis at the same site, ie, lesions that acutely and simultaneously occluded the orifices of the lenticulostriate or neighboring arteries. Persistent occlusion of the middle cerebral arteries and a decrease of cortical regional cerebral blood flow were only found in patients with aphasia or neglect. All patients without aphasia or neglect showed a rapid recanalization of the middle cerebral artery occlusion or a stenosis of the M1 segment and no cortical regional cerebral blood flow decrease. Large striatocapsular infarctions occur due to occlusive disease of the middle cerebral artery (large-vessel disease) and not due to a disseminated in situ occlusion of the long penetrating arteries (small-vessel disease), as in lacunes. Neuropsychological deficits can be explained by decreased cortical blood flow due to a persistent occlusive lesion of the middle cerebral artery.\r"

Recently, it has become possible to map the territories of the deep perforators from the carotid system, based on matching previous anatomical studies with recent data from computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging studies. The middle cerebral artery gives origin to two main groups of perforators: the medial and lateral lenticulostriate arteries. Rarely, the thalamotuberal artery may take origin from the middle cerebral artery but much more commonly it originates from the posterior communicating artery. The anterior cerebral artery gives origin to the anterior lenticulostriate arteries and the recurrent artery of Heubner. The anterior choroidal artery takes its origin from the internal carotid artery and exceptionally from the middle cerebral artery. In addition, a small group of perforators comes directly from the internal carotid artery. The anatomical structures supplied by these perforators are described, and a map of the territories is proposed.\r"

Between 1983 and 1989 we conducted a prospective randomized trial with three treatment strategies: best medical management, best medical management plus intracranial pressure monitoring, and surgical evacuation. Only patients with significant deficit harboring a putaminal hematoma at least 3.0 cm in diameter were entered. The study was interrupted after 21 patients had been studied (9, best medical management; 4, intracranial pressure monitoring; and 8, surgical evacuation). No differences were found among groups for age, admission blood pressure, and time interval between onset of symptoms and arrival at hospital. None of the subjects were capable of returning to prestroke activity. Fifteen (71%) died or remained vegetative at 6 months, and only 4 (19%) were capable of independent life at home. Of the 9 patients in the best medical management arm, 7 were dead or vegetative. In the surgical group, 4 patients died and only 2 were capable of independent life. These results suggest that current medical and neurosurgical therapies remain ineffective in preventing the devastating neurologic consequences of hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage.\r"

Median and quartile survival times were greater in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (group 1, 30 and 50 months; group 4, 20 and 25 months) than in patients who did not receive chemotherapy after RT (group 2, 13 and 20 months; group 3, 15 and 24 months).

The diversity of serum patterns suggests that lipoprotein abnormalities are not causally related to either the endocrinopathy or the spinal muscular atrophy. However, gene linkage studies indicate proximity of the gene for Kennedy's syndrome and the gene encoding the androgen receptor, which could explain the combination of a motor neuron disorder and the endocrine abnormalities.\r"

Homocitrulline was present in their urine, and orotic aciduria and orotidinuria developed in the male sibling following ingestion of allopurinol. Studies on their cultured skin fibroblasts showed deficient metabolism of ornithine, indicating a defect in ornithine transport across the mitochondrial membrane. During therapy with citrulline and phenylbutyrate sodium, plasma ornithine levels increased in both patients, while plasma levels of glutamine and alanine decreased to normal.

The syndrome is often referred to; however, cases are rarely reported, and it is generally an uncommon diagnosis. Of those cases reported, the incidence is six times more frequent in females than in males, and is typically temporally related to minor pelvic or buttock trauma. We describe a case of a 40-year-old woman presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of piriformis muscle syndrome following a gynecologic procedure performed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Electromyographic findings were consistent with this clinical entity. Operative exploration, however, revealed the source of neural compression to be a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery adjacent to the piriformis muscle. The diagnostic features of this clinical syndrome are discussed.\r"

In patients who lack a family history of a similar illness, Leber's disease has been a diagnosis of exclusion. The recent discovery of a specific mitochondrial mutation in many pedigrees affected with the disease has provided the basis for rapid molecular diagnosis of one genetic type of Leber's disease. We have developed a new method, based on a Mae III (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind) restriction fragment length polymorphism, for detecting the Wallace-type Leber's mutation. The method has several advantages over the previously used SfaN I method that make it more suitable for use as a general laboratory test. We demonstrate the utility of this new test in the diagnosis of Leber's disease in a patient with no family history of visual loss.\r"

The diagnosis is based on clinical and angiographic findings, but some of the characteristic features may be either absent or difficult to visualize in the presence of opaque media. With the use of standardized echography (standardized A-scan and contact B-scan echography), we examined nine patients with clear media and clinical evidence of VKH syndrome. Consistent echographic findings included (1) diffuse, low to medium reflective thickening of the choroid posteriorly; (2) serous retinal detachment, located inferiorly or in the posterior pole; (3) mild vitreous opacities with no posterior vitreous detachment; and (4) thickening of the sclera and/or episclera posteriorly. Resolution of these findings occurred with systemic corticosteroid therapy. Standardized echography should be considered an important diagnostic tool in VKH syndrome, especially when visualization of the fundus is poor or when clinical presentation is atypical.\r"

Twenty-two (88%) of 25 grafts in the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group and 23 (96%) of 24 grafts in the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group were clear after 1 year; best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better was noted in 25% of the eyes in the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group and 29% of the eyes in the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group. The mean intraocular pressure for the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group was significantly lower than for the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group at 3 months (17 +/- 4 vs 21 +/- 7 mm Hg) and at 6 months (17 +/- 3 vs 20 +/- 5 mm Hg); but did not differ at 1 year. The mean percent of endothelial cell loss after 1 year did not differ between the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group (32% +/- 26%) and the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group (27% +/- 26%). No clinical or endothelial morphometric advantages were noted after 1 year for the suture-fixated, posterior-chamber intraocular lens over the Kelman-style, one-piece anterior chamber, intraocular lens following pseudophakic penetrating keratoplasty; however, a long-term, prospective, randomized study of these two intraocular lens types is recommended.\r"

Follow-up at 6 months after either procedure indicated that surgery was superior, with patient alignment showing a 92.7% average net change, compared with a 50.50% net change in the botulinum-treated group. There was no difference in response between those patients with a starting deviation of 20 PD or less and greater than 20 PD in the surgery group. However, in the botulinum-treated group, those patients with a starting deviation of 20 PD or less seemed to show better responses than those patients with greater than 20 PD. Patients with esotropia showed an 88.89% change with surgery and a 51.55% change with toxin treatment. Patients with exotropia had a 95.83% change with surgery but a 50.3% change with toxin treatment. Since we had 20 patients with exotropia and 10 patients with esotropia, a more formal comparison would require larger numbers.\r"

Mean (+/- SD) serum retinol values for children with normal and abnormal discs were 22.0 +/- 8.6 micrograms/dL and 18.0 +/- 7.2 micrograms/dL P less than .0001). Mean serum values for normal and abnormal strips were 21.7 +/- 8.6 micrograms/dL and 19.0 +/- 7.7 micrograms/dL (P less than .03).

Our aims were to determine the relationship of drusen characteristics and retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities to the risk of subsequent development of neovascularization in the fellow eye and the risk of subsequent development of recurrent neovascular membranes after photocoagulation in the first eye. Regression analysis demonstrated that the presence of large drusen and focal hyperpigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium were independent risk factors for the subsequent development of neovascularization in the fellow eye (relative risk, 2.4 and 2.5, respectively). Only 10% of eyes with no large drusen or any retinal pigment epithelial hyperpigmentation compared with 58% of eyes with both large drusen and retinal pigment epithelial hyperpigmentation developed neovascularization in the fellow eye within 5 years. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, we noted that the risk of developing recurrent neovascular membranes in the first eye was significantly increased when large drusen (relative risk, 2.8) were noted in the fellow eye at the time of laser treatment in the first eye. Fundus features in the fellow eye appear to help identify patients at high risk of developing visual loss from recurrent neovascular membranes following laser treatment in the first eye and from development of a neovascular membrane in the fellow eye.\r"

Unsutured wounds had no subepithelial fibroplasia but had fibroblasts and collagen fiber orientation parallel to wounds. Unsutured wounds in corneas containing sutures had subepithelial fibroplasia, and fibroblast orientation and fiber deposition parallel to the wound. Epithelial ingrowth and incarceration of Bowman's layer and/or Descemet's membrane in unsutured wounds appeared to disrupt wound healing. Abnormalities in wound healing in sutured or unsutured wounds are associated with lamellar distortion, a modified inflammatory response, and individual wound healing responses.\r"

T-cell lymphocytes (T cells) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several ocular inflammatory diseases of possible autoimmune etiology. We used synthetic peptides that correspond to the amino acid sequence of S-antigen in lymphocyte proliferation assays to identify specific sites in the molecule recognized by human T cells. Ten patients with type II diabetes were studied before and after initial panretinal laser photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. T-cell responses, expressed as a stimulation index, to S-antigen and peptides were negative in all patients before treatment. Three weeks after panretinal laser photocoagulation, eight of 10 assays were positive (stimulation index greater than 2; P less than .01) when lymphocytes were stimulated with peptide BSA(273-292); six of nine were positive (P less than .01) with peptide BSA(303-332); and six of six were positive (P less than .001) with peptide BSA(343-362). Our study identifies several specific sites in S-antigen that elicit human immune responses. The implications of these findings with regard to the pathogenesis and treatment of autoimmune uveitis are discussed.\r"

Neovascularization was induced in rabbit corneas via local implantation of prostaglandin E1 pellets prepared in a slow-release polymer. Animals received daily intraperitoneal injections of 30 mg of amiloride, or an equivalent volume of saline solution for 5 days; both were well tolerated without severe untoward effect. Neovascular response, as documented by corneal photographs, was evaluated after 5 days of injections. The area of induced corneal neovascularization was decreased by 55% in animals receiving amiloride when compared with controls. Thus, amiloride and similar compounds may prove useful in the study and management of neovascularization.\r"

The first stage is a complete fluid-air exchange using an air pump and intraocular linear suction. The air pump then maintains the intraocular pressure at the desired level during adjunctive procedures, such as laser endophotocoagulation. The second stage is an air-gas mixture exchange in which the desired gas, premixed in air to the desired final intraocular concentration, is manually flushed through the eye. This technique allows the attainment of an accurate concentration of intraocular gas if the air-gas mixture exchange is complete. In vitro and in vivo experiments in aphakic human eyes demonstrated that an effectively complete air-gas mixture exchange occurs with a 25-mL flush volume. This result compares favorably with the theoretical prediction derived from a \"pharmacokinetic approximation\" equation.\r"

  ".W": "We performed 2 metaanalyses of placebo-controlled and comparative clinical trials to examine the relative efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate (MTX), injectable gold, D-penicillamine (DP), sulfasalazine (SSZ), auranofin (AUR), and antimalarial drugs, the second-line drugs most commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). For the efficacy study, we applied a set of inclusion criteria and focused on trials which provided information on tender joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or grip strength. We found 66 clinical trials that contained 117 treatment groups of interest, and for each drug, we combined the treatment groups. For each outcome, results showed that AUR tended to be weaker than other second-line drugs. The results of the 3 outcome measures were synthesized into a composite measure of outcomes, and AUR was significantly weaker than MTX (P = 0.006), injectable gold (P less than 0.0001), DP (P less than 0.0001), and SSZ (P = 0.009) and was slightly, but not significantly, weaker than antimalarial agents (P = 0.11). We also found heterogeneity among antimalarial agents, in that patients treated with chloroquine did better than those treated with hydroxychloroquine. We found little difference in efficacy between MTX, injectable gold, DP, and SSZ. A power analysis showed that a trial should contain at least 170 patients per treatment group to successfully differentiate between more effective and less effective (e.g., AUR) second-line drugs. None of the reported interdrug comparative trials we reviewed were this large. For the toxicity study, our inclusion criteria captured RA trials which reported the proportion of patients who discontinued therapy because of drug toxicity and the total proportion who dropped out. We found 71 clinical trials that contained 129 treatment groups. The average proportion who dropped out and the average proportion who dropped out because of drug toxicity were computed for each drug. Overall, 30.2% of the patients in these trials dropped out; 50% of them did so because of drug toxicity. Injectable gold had higher toxicity rates (P less than 0.05) and higher total dropout rates (P less than 0.01) than any other drug; 30% of gold-treated patients dropped out because of side effects versus 15% of all trial patients. Antimalarial drugs and AUR had relatively low rates of toxicity; the rate for MTX was imprecise because of discrepancies between trials. Thus, of the commonly used second-line drugs, AUR is the weakest, and injectable gold is the most toxic. Agents introduced in the future will be compared with these drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To investigate this further, we studied 121 consecutive female patients with definite RA, 52 female patients with probable RA, and 378 female controls. All patients had RA symptoms of recent onset. After a mean followup period of 6 years, patients with definite RA were classified as having either a severe disease course (n = 76) or a mild disease course (n = 45). The negative association between OC use prior to the onset of RA symptoms and the development of RA was limited to those patients with definite RA who had a severe disease course. We therefore conclude that OC use prior to the onset of RA symptoms is only associated with a reduction in the incidence of severe RA. This may explain the divergent results of previous studies.\r"

  ".W": "Levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP) and plasminogen activator (PA)/plasmin were measured and the distribution of PA was studied by immunohistochemical techniques in cartilage and synovium samples from dogs subjected to sectioning of the anterior cruciate ligament of their right knees and sham operation of their left knees (controls). Twenty-three animals were divided into 3 groups and killed at 2, 4, or 8 weeks after surgery. The levels of PA and plasmin were found to be significantly elevated in the osteoarthritic (OA) knee cartilage and synovium at all times after surgery, except for levels of PA in the OA cartilage at 2 weeks. There was a positive correlation between the levels of PA and plasmin in the synovial membrane (r = 0.64, P less than 0.001). In OA knees, the presence of high levels of total and active collagenase was detected in cartilage and in synovium. The levels of these 2 forms of collagenase showed a positive correlation both in cartilage (r = 0.65, P less than 0.001) and in synovium (r = 0.77, P less than 0.001). The levels of TIMP in cartilage from OA and sham operated knees were similar. Although the TIMP level was increased in the OA synovium, it was found only in trace amounts in cartilage. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that both forms of PA, urokinase-type PA and tissue-type PA, and TIMP were present in OA tissues. In the synovium, they were found mainly in monocyte/macrophages, synovial lining cells, and blood vessel cells. In OA cartilage, PA was present only at the superficial level in chondrocytes and in cartilage matrix, whereas TIMP was present in chondrocyte lacunae throughout the full thickness of the cartilage. TIMP was also detected in the superficial level of cartilage from sham operated knees. The results of this study indicate that in OA tissues, there are conditions that favor the synthesis and activation of metalloproteases. PA and plasmin are likely to play an important role in the physiologic activation of metalloproteases, although they are probably not the only system involved in this process. The lack of increased TIMP levels in the OA cartilage, in the presence of increased metalloprotease activity, is also a possible contributing factor in the enzymatic degradation of this tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Articular cartilage is one of the major targets in destructive joint diseases in humans. We studied cellular immune reactions against cartilage cell-surface membranes, because it has recently been suggested that these represent possible antigenic structures, based upon the observation of autoantibodies with this specificity in certain joint diseases. A striking T cell reactivity toward chondrocyte membranes was found both in blood and synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This reactivity was strongly dependent on the presence of monocytes and had all the characteristics of an antigen-driven process. Clonal analysis demonstrated high precursor frequencies in peripheral blood T cells that were reactive against chondrocyte membranes. This response to chondrocyte membranes greatly exceeded the T cell stimulation induced by membranes from other sources such as fibroblasts or epithelial cells. In contrast to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, individuals with osteoarthritis showed a strong peripheral blood and synovial fluid T cell response not only to chondrocyte membranes, but also to fibroblast membrane material. However, there was no reactivity to epithelial cell membranes. Normal donors generally did not show significant responses to any membrane preparation. These data indicate that there is a strong T cell reactivity toward chondrocyte membranes in destructive joint disorders, and this may significantly contribute to the pathogenetic processes that occur in these diseases.\r"

Antibodies were found in the sera of 15% of the RA patients and 50% of the relapsing polychondritis patients, as well as in the cartilage of 69% of the RA patients examined. Reaction with both homologous and heterologous type II collagens was common. Analysis of 19 selected RA sera revealed that autoantibodies were generally associated with specific antibodies to some species of heterologous type II collagen. In contrast, antibodies found in 4% of the non-RA controls were specific for either bovine or chick type II collagen. These findings indicate that autoantibody formation in RA and relapsing polychondritis may occur as a result of an immune response to heterologous type II collagen. However, since RA and relapsing polychondritis patient sera differed in their reactivity with the cyanogen bromide-digested peptides, it is possible that the clinical manifestation of collagen autoimmunity might be influenced by the epitope specificity of the antibodies.\r"

The antiinflammatory effects of GLA administration observed in animal models, and the apparent clinical improvement experienced by 6 or 7 rheumatoid arthritis patients given borage seed oil in this open, uncontrolled study may be due in part to reduced generation of arachidonic acid oxygenation products.\r"

Whereas skin from healthy individuals lacked expression of PDGF-B receptors, receptor expression was seen in sclerodermatous skin lesions from 13 of 14 patients. Increased receptor expression was observed in dermal vessels, as well as on many stromal fibroblast-like cells close to these vessels. PDGF-B receptor expression was most pronounced within and around dermal vessels in which perivascular infiltrates of Leu-4-positive T lymphocytes and HLA-DR-positive, RFD7-positive activated macrophages were present. Both perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates and PDGF-B receptor expression were generally also seen in macroscopically normal areas of the skin of the SSc patients, indicating that the observed phenotypic alterations may precede the macroscopically observable features of scleroderma in the skin. The observed induction of PDGF-B receptors, together with indirect indications of increased synthesis and release of PDGF, would be compatible with altered PDGF-mediated control of connective tissue cell growth as part of the molecular basis for development of the skin lesions in SSc.\r"

AZH confer high relative risk (RR = 14) for lupus nephritis in a Caucasian population of patients. Pilot studies using historical controls suggest that these genes also confer a high risk in non-Caucasian ethnic groups (RR = 24-78). We have found that DR4 is significantly decreased in patients with lupus nephritis. Fifty percent of the patients with lupus nephritis had either the DQ beta 1.1, the DQ beta 1.AZH, or the DQ beta 1.9 alleles. These alleles share amino acid residues that have been predicted to be the contact points for antigen and the T cell receptor.

Abnormalities of either N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase or beta 2-microglobulin excretion were associated with active arthritis as measured by physician global estimate of disease activity, with a polyarticular onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and with the use of slow-acting antirheumatic drugs or the concurrent use of more than 1 nonsteroidal antiinflamtory drug.

  ".W": "Alcohol is considered to be an important risk factor for various bone diseases but recent studies have shown that moderate alcohol intake can be beneficial to bone structure. Alcohol decreases osteoblastic activity, leading to decreased bone formation and defective mineralization. The changes reported in calciotropic hormones, mainly vitamin D and parathyroid hormone, are observed due in part to a deficient intestinal absorption of vitamin D and an inadequate synthesis of its hepatic metabolite, although greater emphasis has been given to dietary deficiencies or lack of exposure to sun. The changes in parathyroid hormone are not consistent and since there is no greater incidence of hyperparathyroidism in alcoholic patients, it suggests that alcohol does not have a long-term effect on the parathyroid glands. Alcohol increases calcitonin secretion acutely; calcitonin is an inhibitor of bone resorption and may be the mechanism by which moderate alcohol intake protects bone structure. Alcohol increases urinary calcium, magnesium and zinc excretion. Zinc deficiency has been postulated as a cause of oesteoporisis because it causes hypogonadism. The decrease in the levels of the gonadal hormones and the increase of cortisol, observed in chronic alcoholics, may indirectly cause osteopenia and aseptic necrosis. To these actions must be added the acidosis due to alcohol and the greater tendency of the alcoholic to fall, all of which influence bone changes and increase the incidence of bone fractures.\r"

The results with GGT, ASAT, ALAT, MCV and the combination of GGT and MCV were studied with respect to the effect of taking the tests once (at eight months), twice (once every four months) or four times (bimonthly). According to our definition, the treatment outcome was good when the laboratory test values were within the normal range during the whole follow-up period. The differences in observed outcome (at eight months after treatment) were small whether one took the tests once at the end of the follow-up period or up to four (i.e. bimonthly) times. Nevertheless, there were some differences between the laboratory markers. To get the most accurate picture of drinking during the follow-up period one should repeat the test bimonthly with ASAT or ALAT, once every four months with GGT (or combined GGT and MCV), and once after eight months with MCV. When the time course of relapses is important for the study the more frequent test taking is also indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Mice (Mus musculus) from three genetic strains with variable responses to ethanol challenge (BALB/c, C57BL/6J and 129/ReJ) were used to evaluate the effect of ethanol feeding on hepatic mRNA specific to the two primary enzymes of ethanol metabolism; alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; E.C. 1.1.1.1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH; E.C. 1.2.1.3). Adh-1 (ADH) and Ahd-2 (ALDH) specific mRNA were evaluated on the livers of ethanol-fed mice and from their age, sex and genotype matched controls (using an isocaloric liquid diet). C57BL/6J (alcohol resistant) mice show a significant (approx. 200%) increase in ADH-1 mRNA levels after ethanol treatment, compared to their matched controls. BALB/c (alcohol sensitive) mice have approximately a 20% increase with ethanol treatment while 129/ReJ (alcohol sensitive) mice show a slight reduction in the ADH-1 specific mRNA following ethanol feeding. A strain-specific pattern is also apparent in the AHD-2 mRNA as a result of ethanol feeding in the experimental animals. C57BL/6J mice have an increase and BALB/c mice show no apparent change in the AHD-2 mRNA. 129/ReJ mice fed an ethanol diet, on the other hand, appear to have a decrease in the level of AHD-2 hepatic mRNA as compared to their matched controls. The relative mRNA levels of the two genes correlate well with the respective enzyme activity levels, but for mice on the control diet only. Ethanol feeding, which causes an apparent reduction in hepatic ADH enzyme activity in BALB/c and 129/ReJ and an apparent increase in ALDH activity in C57BL/6J (under the experimental protocols used) also alters the mRNA levels specific to the two genes. However, changes in the mRNA levels after ethanol feeding cannot be directly related to the changes seen in enzyme activity. The observed steady state level of AHD-2 mRNA and the increase in ALDH activity after ethanol feeding, which is unique to C57BL/6J mice, is expected to offer a faster clearance (metabolism) of acetaldehyde, the toxic metabolite, and may be responsible for, or contribute to, the relative resistance of this strain to ethanol.\r"

Our purpose was to study the binding of acetaldehyde to liver microsomal proteins, a site of ethanol oxidation via cytochrome P-450 (especially P-450 II E1), after chronic administration of ethanol or acetaldehyde for 21 days to rats. The liver microsomal oxidation of 1-butanol by the ethanol-inducible P-450 also was examined. Acetaldehyde bound to liver microsomal proteins was higher in ethanol-fed rats compared with acetaldehyde-treated rats (0.735 vs 0.413 nmol/mg of protein respectively). The biotransformation of n-butanol to butyraldehyde by liver microsomes was increased (by 136%) in ethanol-fed rats vs controls, whereas in acetaldehyde-treated rats this increase was much lower (only 27%). However, in this last group, a significant negative relationship between the quantity of acetaldehyde bound to microsomal proteins and the monooxygenase-catalyzed transformation of butanol by liver microsomes was demonstrated (r = -0.79, P less than 0.01). These results suggest that proteins of liver microsomes are a target for acetaldehyde binding during ethanol oxidation and such adduct formation could impair the oxidative properties of the alcohol-inducible cytochrome P-450.\r"

Ethanol feeding markedly reduced muscle RNA content by 22-34%, when compared to controls. Muscle RNA content of ethanol-fed rats at 7, 14, 28 and 42 days of treatment was significantly lower than initial values (i.e. at 3 days) by 22-38%. Thus, ethanol feeding caused an initial net loss and thereafter a reduction in the rate of accretion of RNA. The marked and sustained loss in the muscle protein synthetic apparatus may be a precipitating event in the development of experimental skeletal muscle myopathy.\r"

The previously acquired ethanol consuming behaviour appeared very resistant to extinction, because ethanol consumption was immediately resumed after renewed access, even at a temporarily increased level. Since physical withdrawal distress was not observed and the increase was higher when interruption lasted longer, the observed behaviour could be attributed to the reinforcing effects of ethanol, leading to specific ethanol-directed behaviour.\r"

Using large quantities of alcohol, and, among men, daily drinking, were associated with depressed mood. These associations were similar for Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, and associations of quantity and frequency with depression were independent of each other. Among women, the cultural and demographic characteristics of high-quantity drinkers and abstainers (both of whom tended to be Mexican Americans) accounted for the association of alcohol use with depression. Among men, there was some suggestion that unemployment and unmarried status mediated the association of alcohol quantity with depression. People who drank greater quantities of alcohol per occasion reported more somatic depressive symptoms, and more frequent male drinkers reported more of most types of depressive symptoms.\r"

The Sterile Connection Device (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) was used to transfer plasma from the satellite to transfer pack units, and these were put in metal canisters before all units were frozen at -65 degrees C. Thawing time was 4.8 +/- 1.3 (SD) minutes and 15 +/- 3.2 (SD) min. for units prepared in modified and standard methods respectively (t = 6.33, P less than .01). The thermal rate constants were calculated as 0.0034 and 0.0033 for the two methods.

Presumed overdose patients (n = 808) were treated using an alternate day protocol based on a 10-question cognitive function examination and presenting vital sign parameters. Asymptomatic patients (n = 451) did not receive GE. AC was administered to asymptomatic patients only on even days. GE in the remaining symptomatic patients (n = 357) was performed only on even days. On emptying days, alert patients had ipecac-induced emesis while obtunded patients received gastric lavage. AC therapy followed gastric emptying. On nonemptying days, symptomatic patients were treated only with AC. No clinical deterioration occurred in the asymptomatic patients treated without GE. AC use did not alter outcome measures in asymptomatic patients. GE procedures in symptomatic patients did not significantly alter the length of stay in the emergency department, mean length of time intubated, or mean length of stay in the intensive care unit. Gastric lavage was associated with a higher prevalence of medical intensive care unit admissions (P = .0001) and aspiration pneumonia (P = .0001). The data support the management of selected acute overdose patients without GE and fail to show a benefit from AC in asymptomatic overdose patients.\r"

Other control variables such as the revised trauma score (RTS) and the TRISS method (which estimates the probability of survival for each patient) additionally require that values of blood pressure, Glasgow coma scale, and respiratory rate, be recorded in the emergency department. The authors question when the RTS, ISS, the ISS and age, or the probability of survival calculated using the TRISS method should be used to control for severity of injuries in trauma research. Relations between predictor variables and (1) survival to hospital discharge, (2) hospital length of stay for survivors, and (3) length of ICU stay were compared by cause of injury: penetrating, motor vehicle accident, low fall, or other blunt. Data were collected over 12 months for 2,914 consecutive adult patients who died or stayed in five nontrauma and three trauma centers for 48 hours or more. For survival, the false-negative rates of probability of survival calculated using the TRISS method were approximately half that of the ISS and age; no variable adequately explained survival among those with low falls. Combinations of ISS, RTS, and age explained the most variation in lengths of hospital stay among survivors, while ISS explained the most variation in lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Researchers should consider the ISS with RTS and age to control for severity when lengths of hospital or ICU stay are studied. The TRISS method should be used in studies of survival. In both cases, the RTS which requires data collection in the emergency department must be calculated.\r"

  ".W": "Bretylium tosylate has been shown effective in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation and in the prevention of its recurrence. However, lidocaine is generally preferred because bretylium could have adverse hemodynamic effects related to its antiadrenergic action. To explore further the differences between these two antiarrhythmic agents, the authors compared the effects of bretylium, lidocaine, and saline on a standardized dog model of ventricular fibrillation followed by electromechanical dissociation (EMD). The protocol included three successive episodes of cardiac arrest in each animal. Three minutes before each episode of ventricular fibrillation, 5 mg/kg of bretylium tosylate (n = 11), 1 mg/kg of lidocaine (n = 9) or saline (n = 12) were administered blindly. There was no difference in the duration of cardiac arrest (bretylium, 8 min 18 sec; lidocaine, 7 min 54 sec; saline, 8 min 20 sec) or the total doses of epinephrine required to resuscitate the animals. Both bretylium and lidocaine appeared to preserve cardiac function 5 minutes after recovery, as stroke volume increased from 17.8 +/- 6.7 to 18.7 +/- 6.7 mL (NS) after bretylium and from 17.7 +/- 7.7 to 19.0 +/- 7.0 mL (NS) after lidocaine, but decreased from 19.0 +/- 5.3 to 14.6 +/- 6.0 mL (P less than .05) after saline. During the first 10 minutes of EMD, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia recurred in 4 dogs treated with lidocaine, 3 dogs treated with saline, but no dog treated with bretylium (P less than .05 between bretylium and saline).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were no differences between the 7- and 12-month groups, because CPR retention overall was poor. Only 19.4% of subjects reported using the retention packet; therefore, subjects were regrouped into practice and no practice groups for purposes of further statistical analysis. There were significant differences in retention in subjects who practiced compared with subjects who did not. These findings underscore the importance of promoting practice/review after initial CPR training for family members of cardiac patients.\r"

The 3 mL group exhibited even more favorable courses in the PaO2 (initial drop 16 mm Hg on average).

During a 6-month period, 169 of 1715 (9.9%) base station calls in an urban emergency medical service (EMS) system were for physician involvement in a PIRC. Patients' dispositions were as follows: left at scene against medical advice (53%); taken by ambulance to the hospital (28%); left with friend (13%); other disposition (5%). While police were called to the scene 41 times, they placed a \"legal hold\" on only 10 patients. Leaving the patient at the scene against medical advice was associated (logistic regression analysis; P less than .05) with the absence of the following factors: family on the scene and a police hold, and with the presence of the following factors: treated hypoglycemia, alcohol use, orientation, and normal speech. The development of statutes that allow police hold placement under the guidance of the base station physician may be necessary. Such statutes would aid transportation of a patient considered by EMS personnel to have impaired mental capacity that may limit the patient's ability to understand medical care decisions.\r"

While therapies are available to the prehospital care provider for treating acute asthma, no previous controlled studies have been performed demonstrating the treatment in the field is efficacious and safe. The authors conducted a controlled trial of the prehospital use of nebulized isoetharine in an urban emergency medical services system. Fifty-two patients with acute asthma were studied. Patients were initially evaluated with a peak flow meter. Half of the patients received isoetharine, while the control group received basic life support only. There was no difference in baseline values. Peak expiratory flow increased from 138 L/min to 148 L/min in the control group, while it increased from 149 L/min to 218 L/min in the treatment group (P less than .001). The authors conclude that paramedic treatment of acute asthma with nebulized isoetharine is effective in improving pulmonary function and clinical status during transport.\r"

However, in a retrospective review of 65 cases of confirmed EP managed over 18 months at an urban teaching hospital, only 37 of 65 patients (57%, Cl95 = 44%, 69%) received prompt diagnosis and treatment; delays occurred in 28 patients (43%). In 10 of the 27 delayed cases, the diagnosis of EP was not even considered at the time of the first visit. In patients with a delayed diagnosis, morbidity (transfusions, cardiovascular instability, progression of illness) did occur. Diagnostic pitfalls that resulted in delayed care were reviewed, delays most commonly occurred in patients with a benign examination or \"atypical\" pain. Risk factors for EP were missed (7 patients, 25%), subtle clues to blood loss were often ignored (10 patients, 36%), and passage of tissue was thought to exclude EP (2 patients). Ultrasound was only helpful for half of the diagnoses and was misinterpreted in 27%. A dry or serous culdocentesis occurred frequently. In five patients, a falling or low quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin level was believed to indicate a completed abortion. The authors conclude that almost half of EPs are still missed on the first physician visit; errors and pitfalls in diagnosis are still common in the 1980s.\r"

Though the majority of cases never require medical attention, the \"body-packer\" frequently presents with life-threatening symptoms of intoxication, including seizures and cardiorespiratory collapse, as well as mechanical obstruction from the ingested drug packets. The risk to asymptomatic smugglers may vary with packaging materials, and remains unknown. Lack of controlled studies, and variations in packaging materials and clinical outcomes have prevented formulation of a consistent management strategy. Current recommendations for asymptomatic body-packers vary from immediate surgical removal, to use of laxatives, to observation. The authors present the first reported case of an asymptomatic cocaine body-packer treated with whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution. This strategy was safe, well tolerated, resulted in the rapid elimination of drug packets from the gastrointestinal tract, and facilitated assessment by contrast radiography. The potential benefits and limitations for the use of whole bowel irrigation in this difficult problem are discussed.\r"

Although 11% were initially admitted and 4% were later treated, the remainder received their care solely in the ED. Unlike most occupational injuries, people of any age may be involved in agricultural injuries; 27% in this series were less than 18 years of age and 5% were 65 years or older. Just over half of all injuries were from mechanical devices, including tractor and farm machinery. The remainder were from animals, falls, or exposure. Although several different types of injuries occurred, the most common diagnoses were soft tissue injuries and fractures and the most common procedure was diagnostic radiography followed by wound and fracture care. An ED in a rural setting should be prepared to deal with agricultural trauma.\r"

Of interest is that worker no. 2's carboxyhemoglobin level increased from 2% to 8% over the 9 hours following admission, despite administration of 40% to 50% oxygen by endotracheal tube. Among the conclusions that can be drawn are (1) the cause of death in these patients was not carbon monoxide poisoning, but solvent-induced narcosis; (2) carboxyhemoglobin levels may continue to rise following cessation of exposure, despite administration of high flow oxygen; (3) rescuers can easily become victims if proper protective clothing and respirators are not worn.\r"

Recent evidence suggests that current stabilization measures used by transport teams can be inadequate for this critically ill patient population. In trauma, speed has been considered a necessity to get the patient to a facility which cannot be carried out to the field, eg, an operating room. For acute medical illnesses, critical care transport teams can bring intensive care technology to the patient. Accumulating evidence supports the premise that speed of transport is not as important as stabilization before transport, knowledge of hemodynamics during transport, and early use of critical care monitoring systems. Other reports identify the need for initial evaluation and stabilization of critically ill patients by physicians at the critical care level of expertise. Accordingly, critical care transportation teams have evolved, creating new notions of pretransport stabilization not applicable to previous transport systems.\r"

The relationships, however, between ventricular arrhythmias and coexistent coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular fibrosis have not been examined in hypertensive LVH. We carried out coronary arteriography on fifteen hypertensive patients with LVH and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (greater than or equal to 3 consecutive ventricular complexes) of whom nine (60%) were free of significant (greater than 50% stenosis) coronary disease. To identify other possible correlates of left ventricular arrhythmias, 28 patients with LVH, comprising 17 with ventricular tachycardia and 11 without ventricular arrhythmias, underwent quantitative assessment of left ventricular function (angiographic ejection fraction), left ventricular mass (echocardiography), and left ventricular fibrosis (endomyocardial biopsy). Ejection fraction was not significantly different between the two groups (53 +/- 8% v 62 +/- 2%, P = NS). However, left ventricular mass was significantly greater (442 +/- 28 g v 339 +/- 34 g, P less than .05) and percentage fibrosis significantly higher (19 +/- 4% v 3 +/- 1%, P less than .001) in those patients with ventricular tachycardia. Thus ventricular arrhythmias in hypertensive patients with LVH cannot be entirely attributed to coexistent coronary disease, nor to left ventricular dysfunction, but are related to the degree of cardiac hypertrophy and subendocardial fibrosis.\r"

However, little is known about the effects of the development of hypertension on the electro-physiological properties of the heart. To study this relationship, dogs were chronically instrumented for recording mean arterial pressure and conducting cardiac electrical testing during right ventricular pacing using an intracavitary bipolar catheter. In normotension, ventricular fibrillation threshold was determined under alpha-chloralose anesthesia, after which perinephritic hypertension was induced by wrapping one kidney in silk followed by contralateral nephrectomy. During serial testing of the same animals, ventricular fibrillation threshold was significantly increased early in the development of hypertension (2 to 3 weeks after renal wrapping), but found to be significantly reduced at 6 to 7 weeks after renal wrapping. The increase in ventricular fibrillation threshold was eliminated by cholinergic blockade.\r"

All subjects were studied in a double-blind crossover design while they consumed caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee. We examined them at rest, during a standardized mental arithmetic task, and for 6 h of ambulatory monitoring in their regular work setting (research facility and hospital). On days of drinking caffeinated coffee, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were consistently elevated at all time points (P less than .0005). In response to the mental arithmetic task, the increase in systolic blood pressure over the resting value was particularly exaggerated on caffeinated coffee (P = .0003). For heart rate, there were no effects from caffeine. The study demonstrates that the blood pressure-elevating effects of caffeine, well-known from laboratory studies, are sufficiently robust to be evident in patients' uncontrolled work environments. It implies the importance of caffeine restriction for hypertensive patients. It also indicates the utility of ambulatory blood pressure techniques in studying the blood pressure effects of various nutritional factors taken ad lib in the real world.\r"

In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients received 50 g of either marine oil (n = 8) or vegetable oil (n = 8) daily for 6 weeks following a baseline observation period. Diastolic blood pressure declined during treatment with fish oil (mean +/- SEM, 96 +/- 2 v 89 +/- 2 mm Hg, P = .02), but did not change with vegetable oil (92 +/- 1 v 94 +/- 1 mm Hg). Systolic blood pressure did not change significantly during either treatment. Serum triglycerides declined (by approximately 30%) in patients receiving only marine oil, but total cholesterol, LDL-, HDL-, HDL2-, and HDL3-cholesterol-subfractions and apolipoproteins A-I and B were unchanged in both treatment groups. Bleeding time increased by 33% during treatment with marine oil but did not change with vegetable oil supplements. Marine oil did not alter in vitro platelet aggregation thresholds. The lack of a significant correlation between blood pressure changes and platelet membrane fluidity, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, norepinephrine, or epinephrine suggests that these variables did not mediate the antihypertensive effect of the marine oil. We conclude that large doses of marine oil reduce diastolic blood pressure, lower triglycerides, and increase bleeding time in patients with mild hypertension.\r"

Patients received incremental doses of 1 to 10 mg delivered at 10 min intervals over 50 to 80 min. Blood pressure (BP) was lowered within 5 to 10 min after the initial dose was administered and continued to decline, reaching a maximum response after 20 min (2 to 4 mg). At this time group mean BP fell from 175 +/- 3/111 +/- 1 to 166 +/- 3/97 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Additional dose increments to an average cumulative dose of 40 mg did not increase the initial effect. No adverse side effects or symptomatic hypotension occurred in any subject. There was a significant correlation between diastolic BP decreases observed in response to intravenous captopril and subsequent long-term oral captopril therapy. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide increased the proportion of patients reaching normotension. We conclude that small intravenous bolus injections of captopril appear to be effective rapidly and are well tolerated in moderate to severe essential hypertension. Short-term intravenous administration seems to predict the response to chronic oral captopril therapy.\r"

Infusion of amiloride (20 mg/day) or frusemide (50 mg/day) for three days into normotensive sheep did not have any significant effects on blood pressure. Amiloride blocked ACTH-induced hypertension and the sodium retention and hypokalemia which is usually associated with ACTH administration. Frusemide failed to completely block the hypertension and potassium loss, however it blocked the transient initial urinary sodium retention associated with ACTH-induced hypertension. As frusemide failed to completely block the hypertension it is unlikely that the amiloride effect is due primarily to effects on urinary Na excretion. It is possible that amiloride is exerting its antihypertensive effects by blocking sodium channels.\r"

  ".W": "The medulla oblongata is thought to play an important role in the central regulation of blood pressure. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin (Gal) coexist with norepinephrine (NE) and may have a functional interaction in this region. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether NPY and Gal could modulate the presynaptic neuronal mechanisms, especially the alpha-adrenoceptor function, inhibiting NE release in medulla oblongata. In slices of rat medulla oblongata, clonidine, an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, inhibited the NE release elicited by electrical stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner. A combination of clonidine and low concentration of NPY (1 X 10(-9) mol/L) resulted in an increase in the inhibitory action of clonidine on stimulation-evoked NE release. The inhibitory action of clonidine was also potentiated by Gal (1 X 10(-8) mol/L). These results indicate the existence of the presynaptic NPY- and Gal-receptors on noradrenergic nerve terminals, which may enhance the presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor function to inhibit NE release. This suggests a possible involvement of NPY and Gal in the regulation of sympathetic nerve activity in medulla oblongata.\r"

They play a role in the inappropriate choice of too-high daily doses of some antihypertensive drugs at the end of extensive international development programs. They are also implicated in the insufficient control of blood pressure observed in the long-term multicenter trials in hypertension, where some patients have been treated for several years with drugs that were not the most appropriate for their disease and which did not adequately control their blood pressure. In addition to the parallel group studies, the use of double-blind two-period or multiple period crossover designs can provide valid data for the dose-finding of new antihypertensive drugs and their comparative evaluation. At the end of the trial, these designs also offer each patient the opportunity to be treated with the right dose of the drug most appropriate for his or her disease.\r"

Doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg captopril reduced mean arterial pressure by 33 +/- 4, 31 +/- 7, and 51 +/- 4 mm Hg and increased plasma renin activity by 40.1 +/- 9.8, 57.6 +/- 3.2, and 34.4 +/- 15.2 ng A1/mL/h, respectively. The time-activity curves of both 99mTc-DTPA and 131I-hippuran indicated that renal excretory function in the stenotic kidney was compromised with all three doses of captopril. However, if nitroprusside was used to reduce the mean arterial pressure to a level comparable to that with captopril, there was no appreciable increase in plasma renin activity and renal excretory function was only partially affected in the stenotic kidney. One hour after the administration of 0.5 mg/kg captopril, the function of the stenotic kidneys was partially restored and, by two hours, the time-activity curves were comparable to control scans. These data demonstrate a reversible, time-limited suppression of stenotic kidney function by captopril in renovascular hypertension and provide support for the use of captopril in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension by radionuclide dynamic scintigraphy.\r"

We have characterized simple N-benzylimidazoles as weak, but selective AII receptor antagonists with a competitive mode of action. Chemical modification of these early leads led to EXP6155 and EXP6803, which show approximately 10- and 100-fold higher affinity. Oral activity was obtained for EXP7711, and in particular for EXP9654. This class of compounds displaces 3H-AII from its specific binding sites in various tissues. They competitively antagonize AII-induced responses in various in vitro and in vivo preparations, but do not influence AII-induced responses to KCl, norepinephrine, and vasopressin, nor do they affect converting enzyme or renin. In high renin models of elevated blood pressure, such as the renal hypertensive rat and sodium-depleted dog, these substances produce a sustained decrease in arterial pressure without changing heart rate after intravenous and oral (EXP7711 and EXP9654) administration. None of these compounds showed agonistic activity in any of the above test systems. In conclusion, the nonpeptide structures described herein are selective and competitive AII receptor antagonists and add another dimension to the arsenal of drugs manipulating the RAS.\r"

  ".W": "Renin and catecholamine levels were determined in patients with mild to moderate hypertension before and after treatment with sustained release diltiazem or captopril and were correlated with the blood pressure response to these antihypertensives. Eight weeks of treatment with either agent led to equal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma norepinephrine did not predict the blood pressure response to either agent. Diltiazem significantly increased both PRA and supine norepinephrine levels. However, in the diltiazem treated patients, there was no correlation between the change in plasma norepinephrine and the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, there was a negative correlation (P less than .05) between the reactive rise in PRA and the decrease in systolic blood pressure. Thus, the antihypertensive response to a calcium channel blocker may be determined, in part, by the reactive response of pressor systems.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a blood pressure reduction by 10 mg extended release felodipine once daily on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) as well as the possible diabetogenic effect of felodipine was studied. A 2 X 12 week placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study was performed in 12 hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients without nephropathy on concomitant treatment with beta-blocker and/or a diuretic agent. Metabolic control as estimated by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma C-peptide was unaltered after felodipine. Blood pressure was significantly reduced by felodipine: systolic 166 +/- 26 mm Hg (placebo) v 153 +/- 26 mm Hg (felodipine) (P less than .05) and diastolic 95 +/- 7 mm Hg v 90 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than .05). Heart rate was unchanged. There was no correlation between blood pressure and UAE, but the relative change in UAE expressed as UAE placebo/UAE felodipine was significantly correlated to the fall in systolic blood pressure (r = 0.64, P = .03) and mean blood pressure (r = 0.66, P = .02). Since microalbuminuria predicts proteinuria and reduced survival, early antihypertensive treatment may be beneficial in NIDDM as it is in IDDM. Long-term consequences on kidney function and mortality remains, however, to be elucidated.\r"

Both platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine were significantly increased in patients with pheochromocytoma when compared with hypertensive and control groups (P less than .001). No correlation between platelet and plasma catecholamines was detected in all studied groups.

  ".W": "Blood pressure (BP) becomes more sodium and body fluid sensitive as renal function deteriorates. Thus, hypertension in chronic renal failure is mostly of the sodium sensitive type. We studied whether the increased sodium sensitivity (SS) can be restored to normal on the maintenance phase of hemodialysis (HD) therapy. Body weight (BW) and BP (specifically, mean arterial pressure [MAP]) were measured after HD and before the next HD, and the body fluid sensitivity (BFS) was calculated as the ratio of changes in these factors on both introduction and maintenance phases in HD patients (n = 56) who were not taking any antihypertensive drugs (BFS = delta MAP/delta BW). In a preliminary study, the amount of interdialytic sodium intake (QNa+) was measured (n = 30), and SS was calculated as the ratio of the change in MAP to QNa+ (SS = delta MAP/QNa+). Interdialytic BW gain (3.1 +/- 0.1 kg) was correlated with the amount of sodium intake (136 +/- 17 mEq), resulting in a positive relationship between BFS and SS (r = 0.79, P less than .0001). Therefore, BFS was used as an index of SS. As a whole, BFS decreased from the introduction to the maintenance phase (6.5 +/- 1.0 to 3.5 +/- 0.6 mm Hg/L, P less than .01). This decrease was marked (6.2 +/- 1.1 to 2.9 +/- 0.6 mm Hg/L, P less than .01) in patients (n = 46) whose BP was normalized in the maintenance phase, while not significant (7.9 +/- 1.9 to 6.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg/L) in patients (n = 10) whose BP was still high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Endothelin (0.2 to 5.0 ng/kg/min) elicited a dose-dependent reduction in the renal blood blow with no changes in systemic blood pressure. Endothelin infusion (0.2 ng/kg/min) decreased the renal blood flow by 30% and urinary sodium excretion by 50% without any changes in the glomerular filtration rate. However, higher doses did reduce glomerular filtration rate. These data suggest that endothelin preferentially constricts efferent arterioles and that endothelin may enhance the renal reabsorption of sodium.\r"

When 6 mg/kg/day of benidipine, a newly developed calcium channel blocker, was administered simultaneously with 60 micrograms/kg/day of endothelin, the systolic blood pressure of conscious rats rose on Day 1 to only 137.0 +/- 2.4 mm Hg (P less than .05) compared to the rise to 163.8 +/- 4.7 mm Hg when endothelin alone was infused. The antihypertensive effect of benidipine was sustained. The present results suggest that endothelin can act as a circulating hormone. In addition, they clearly demonstrate that the calcium channel blocker attenuates the elevation of blood pressure induced by endothelin.\r"

A group of 44 inpatients undergoing routine blood sampling served as a control. Serum K+, blood pressure and heart rate were measured before (casual) and after (baseline) 20 min of rest in the recumbent position. Baseline serum K+ values were significantly higher than casual values in patients participating to the experimental protocol while no change was observed in inpatients undergoing routine blood sampling. The increase in serum K+ induced by relaxation was significantly related to heart rate decrease (r = 0.73). After relaxation 75% of patients had an increase in serum K+ with a change greater than 10% in about 35% of patients. In a subgroup of patients who repeated the same test three times, the alarm reaction was still evident and not reproducible within each patient. These data suggest that when potassium levels are measured in outpatients undergoing diagnostic or experimental procedures falsely reduced levels can be found in a large proportion of subjects.\r"
