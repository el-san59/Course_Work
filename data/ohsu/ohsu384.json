  ".U": "88279262\r", 
  ".W": "Despite a decade of experience, there is still no consensus as to the optimal IV contrast regimen for use in combined abdominal and pelvic CT scanning. In order to determine which regimen is most effective, 90 patients undergoing CT were prospectively randomized into one of three groups, depending on the method by which IV contrast material was administered: (1) a single bolus (150 ml or 175 ml, depending on the patient's weight) started when scans were made at the level of the dome of the diaphragm; (2) a split bolus delivered by means of a power injector, with the first bolus (100 or 125 ml) given when scans were made at the level of the dome of the diaphragm and the second bolus (50 ml) given when scans were made at the level of the iliac crest; (3) an initial hand-delivered bolus (100 or 125 ml) given when scans were made at the level of diaphragm, followed by rapid IV drip infusion of 50 ml throughout the remainder of the study. Quantitative comparison of pre- and postcontrast scans was performed at two levels: at the mid-liver to assess hepatic enhancement and 1 cm above the sacrosciatic notch to assess pelvic vascular enhancement. The single bolus provided better mean liver enhancement (46 H) than did either the split-bolus (36 H) or the bolus-drip (32 H) method (p less than .05). The last two methods achieved a sufficient aortocaval difference (greater than 10 H) to allow for evaluation of the liver in the nonequilibrium phase of contrast enhancement in which lesion detection is thought to be optimal. Mean enhancement of pelvic vessels was significantly better with the split bolus (arterial enhancement of 56 H, venous enhancement of 47 H) than with the single bolus (34 H, 31 H) or bolus-drip infusion (38 H, 35 H) (p less than .05). We conclude that the split-bolus method is optimal for routine combined abdominal and pelvic CT scanning. The bolus-drip method is the least effective method for administering the contrast material.\r"

  ".W": "MR imaging is emerging as a potential means of detecting portal venous thrombosis (PVT). Therefore, we attempted to establish specific criteria with which to diagnose PVT on conventional spin-echo images. In a retrospective review of 342 consecutive abdominal MR scans performed with a 0.5-T magnet, we identified nine patients with persistent signal in the portal vein and used the findings in these patients to establish criteria with which to diagnose PVT. We subsequently applied these criteria to 109 additional consecutive abdominal MR scans performed with the same magnet. Fifteen cases were found in which all images showed either (1) signal involving the entire width of the portal vein lumen, which approximated (with T1 weighting) and exceeded (with T2 weighting) the intensity of the hepatic parenchyma in images in which the hepatic veins showed a complete flow void or (2) complete nonvisualization of the portal vein and its major branches in images that showed a flow void in portal venous collaterals and hepatic veins. All patients had unequivocal findings of PVT on at least one other imaging study (CT or sonography) or at surgery. Although the sensitivity of these signs could not be calculated, their specificity was 100%. We conclude that in the presence of these signs, the diagnosis of PVT can be made with confidence.\r"

The imaging studies showed that 10 (83%) of 12 tumors were solitary, one was multilobulated with several satellite nodules, and one was bilobed. Surface lobulations were present in nine (82%) of 11 tumors on CT, five of five on sonography, and seven (88%) of eight on angiography. A central scar was identified in five (45%) of 11 tumors on CT, three (60%) of five on sonography, and two (25%) of eight on angiography. Calcification was seen in six (55%) of 11 tumors on CT, four (80%) of five on sonography, and one (13%) of eight on plain films. The tumors were correctly staged as resectable or nonresectable by CT in eight (73%) of 11 patients, by sonography in four (80%) of five, and by angiography in five (63%) of eight. Understaging was responsible for all but one of the staging errors. Distinguishing fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma from more common hepatocellular carcinoma can affect surgical planning and survival.\r"

In order to reassess renal echogenicity as an indicator of disease, three experienced radiologists blindly reviewed the sonograms of the right kidney and liver in 153 patients. The prevalence of renal disease was 26% (40/153). Accepted sonographic criteria for abnormal renal echogenicity (kidney echogenicity greater than or equal to liver) were neither sensitive (62%) nor specific (58%) for renal disease, with a positive predictive value of 35%. Most of these inaccuracies occurred because 43 (72%) of 60 patients in whom renal echogenicity was equal to that of liver had normal renal function. If stricter criteria for abnormality were adopted (kidney echogenicity greater than liver), specificity (96%) and positive predictive value (67%) rose; however, sensitivity was only 20%. We conclude that renal echogenicity equal to the echogenicity of liver is not a good indicator of disease. Use of stricter criteria (kidney echogenicity greater than liver) provides a specific but insensitive test.\r"

  ".U": "88279278\r", 
  ".W": "To better understand how the internal composition of ovarian teratomas influences their sonographic features, we compared their sonographic and CT appearances in 23 cases. Sixteen lesions had a mixed echo texture, with hypoechoic as well as echogenic components; two were anechoic and five were entirely echogenic. Correlation with the CT images showed that the fat present in most teratomas had variable sonographic appearances. Pure sebum was anechoic or hypoechoic, but fat intermixed with hair strands was echogenic and often attenuated the sound beam because of the numerous tissue interfaces created within the mass. The hypoechoic component of the teratoma corresponded, on CT, to low-attenuation fat in 12 tumors and to fluid in five. Most teratomas contained a dermoid plug, a protuberance arising from the tumor wall and containing hair follicles and often fragments of bone or teeth. On sonography, all dermoid plugs were seen as an echogenic mass, often associated with distal acoustic shadowing and protruding into the hypoechoic portion of the teratoma. When the dermoid plug was large and occupied most of the tumor, the entire teratoma appeared echogenic, with no discernible anechoic component. We found that three factors greatly affected the sonographic appearance of ovarian teratomas: the size of the dermoid plug, the presence and location of calcified elements, and the histologic composition of the fatty component.\r"

One hundred eighty-nine pacemaker patients' charts were examined retrospectively to identify pacemaker problems: inadequate sensing, non-capture, battery failure, myoinhibition, muscle stimulation, and inadequate threshold safety margin. Twenty-nine patients (15%) were identified as having pacemaker problems. A total of 41 problems were identified, of which 28 (68%) were corrected by reprogramming. Sixty-one percent of the problems were found during a clinic visit. Problems occurred more frequently during the first year in dual-chamber devices (62%) vs single-chamber devices (35%). During years 1 to 4, when few problems are expected, 30% of all problems of single-chamber devices occurred and 39% of all problems of dual-chamber devices occurred. This is a period of time that Medicare guidelines allow for one clinic visit per year for single- and two visits per year for dual-chamber devices. These data suggest: (1) Many pacemaker problems will be missed with transtelephonic follow-up alone. (2) The majority of problems involving dual-chamber devices occurred in the first year. (3) For both dual- and single-chamber devices, an unexpected significant percentage of problems occurred in 1 to 4 years. (4) Medicare guidelines may be inadequate for follow-up during this time period.\r"

  ".U": "88279340\r", 
  ".W": "The pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of new alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists for the treatment of hypertension was reviewed (Table XIV). Although all these agents block alpha 1 receptors, some of them have additional effects on histamine, serotonin, dopamine, and alpha 2 receptors. These other actions account for the differences in the side effect profiles observed, i.e., increased incidence of central nervous system side effects found with indoramin, ketanserin, and urapidil, as well as for some additional beneficial effects of ketanserin (i.e., antiplatelet aggregation activity). The magnitude of BP reduction observed with antagonists of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors is modest. In most studies, the degree of BP reduction is comparable to that of prazosin, but less than that achieved with thiazide diuretics, beta-receptor antagonists, or methyldopa. Studies on the comparative efficacy and safety of new alpha 1 antagonists with converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium-channel blockers are not available. In general, alpha 1 antagonists produce greater reductions in standing than in supine BP, an effect due to the venodilatory action of these drugs. New alpha 1 antagonists appear to have equal efficacy in black and white hypertensive individuals. Their comparative efficacy and safety in young vs elderly hypertensive individuals requires further investigation. No information about the possible development of tolerance during treatment with new alpha 1 blockers was encountered. The effects of alpha 1 antagonists on HR are variable and depend on how long after the oral dose the measurements were obtained. In most studies, no significant HR changes are noticed for readings obtained 24 hours post dose; whereas tachycardia has been observed at the time of peak hypotension. Since alpha 1 antagonist-induced tachycardia is most likely of reflex nature, i.e., mediated to an increase in sympathetic activity, the increased HR may be associated with increases in myocardial contractility and in myocardial oxygen consumption. Consequently, a 24-hour HR monitoring during treatment with alpha 1 antagonists should be required for evaluation of new agents. The hemodynamic, humoral, and hormonal effects of the newer alpha 1-receptor antagonists are comparable to those of prazosin. The most consistent finding is a reduction in total peripheral resistance associated with either no change or with only small increases in cardiac index. These agents have been shown either not to change or to increase renal blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Many steps in the process are regulated by the cell to optimize contraction, and these can often be modified to benefit the patient with heart damage. These include the action potential, calcium channels, release and uptake of cellular calcium, sensitivity of contractile proteins to calcium, and energy utilization. A dramatic expansion of our understanding of these cellular contractile and regulatory processes gives us an unprecedented opportunity to devise new ways of modifying cardiac contraction to the benefit of our patients.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of the left ventricle to modulate its performance is an important and integral component in the cardiovascular system's adaptive response to increased workload. Abnormalities in ventricular contractility can blunt this response and thus significantly limit the patient's functional capacity. The accurate determination and quantitation of cardiac contractility and reserve is a difficult task in the symmetrically contracting ventricle and more so when regional contraction abnormalities are present. Moreover, derangements in other physiologic variables, such as ventricular loading conditions, heart rate, systemic vascular tone, cardiac autonomic function, and pulmonary gas exchange, can diminish cardiopulmonary reserve. This report relates the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand and efficiency to the currently available forms of exercise, pacing, and pharmacologic stress testing. Within this framework, commonly used as well as newer approaches to the noninvasive assessment of stress-induced changes in left ventricular performance and contractility are addressed. In addition, several examples are presented in which noninvasive techniques for assessing intracardiac structures, pressures, and flows (eg, echo/Doppler, radionuclide angiography, rapid acquisition computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) are combined with various cardiovascular stress tests to achieve more reliable measures of myocardial contractility and reserve.\r"

Hemodynamic studies in patients with coronary artery disease confirm major coronary vasodilator actions, perhaps even exceeding its considerable systemic vasodilator properties with little or no negative inotropic effect. Three recent controlled clinical trials that used nicardipine alone suggest approximately 20% to 30% increase in exercise time, and at least that much decrease in anginal episodes and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption when compared with placebo in doses of 90 to 120 mg daily. Five trials comparing nicardipine with other calcium channel blockers, and three with beta blockers, suggest equivalent efficacy, including decrease in angina and increase in exercise time. Adverse effects of nicardipine generally relate to its potent vasodilatory capability and are usually minor. Side effects are frequent at the beginning of many trials, usually do not cause undue withdrawals, and are quite rare after 6 to 12 months on the drug in most studies.\r"

The more widespread use of vasodilators--either alpha-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or calcium channel blockers--therefore seems appropriate. Among the calcium channel blockers, nicardipine appears to be a particularly attractive choice, in part because of its lack of negative inotropism.\r"

Some preliminary data also indicate that coronary heart disease is much more prevalent in blacks than previously suspected and that coronary heart disease mortality among blacks may indeed not be declining, as it is for white populations. Major contributors to these findings in blacks are an increased prevalence and severity of hypertension, a possibly increased susceptibility to end-organ damage, socioeconomic factors and beliefs that affect hypertension control, and very possibly some obsolete treatments that focus on blood pressure numbers and do not emphasize the black person and the associated risk factors. Diuretic therapy has long been the mainstay treatment for black hypertensives, but the effects of diuretics on lipid levels and left ventricular hypertrophy, among other factors, should be carefully assessed. A recent study of beta-blockers in blacks showed that metoprolol was effective and well tolerated. Consideration of epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and pharmacotherapeutic features of hypertension in blacks may require traditional views of this disease and its treatment in this special population to be reevaluated.\r"

Results from a large-scale, multicenter international study have shown that a regimen in which antihypertensive treatment is initiated with metoprolol once daily is effective, safe, and well tolerated in elderly hypertensive patients. This might be of particular importance since a steep increase in cardiovascular mortality and other atherosclerotic complications is seen with age. In many elderly hypertensive patients, symptoms of heart failure might be caused by poor filling in stiff hearts rather than ineffective systolic contractions. By reducing heart rate with use of a cardioselective beta-blocker, diastole will be prolonged; this will improve filling and hence stroke volume and will increase coronary flow. Long-term treatment with metoprolol has also been found to reduce left ventricular systolic wall stress, reverse hypertrophy, improve left ventricular compliance, decrease the stiffness of large arteries, reduce total peripheral resistance, and reduce albuminuria. The improvement in the stiffness of the large arteries might be of particular clinical importance in elderly patients who have isolated systolic hypertension.\r"

Nonetheless, several studies have now demonstrated the beneficial effects of antihypertensive drug therapy in older patients. The Safety After Fifty Evaluation trial was designed to determine the short-term efficacy and tolerability of once-daily therapy with the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of mild hypertension in patients 50 to 75 years of age.

These symptoms affect 5% to 10% of patients taking these drugs. The mechanism by which beta-blockers may induce central nervous system effects is uncertain. Relative lipophilicity as a factor affecting penetrance of the blood-brain barrier has not proved to be a reliable predictor of whether the drug will cause such disturbances. Comparisons of atenolol (hydrophilic) and metoprolol (lipophilic) have shown no differences between these drugs with respect to side effects of the central nervous system. The incidence of central nervous system effects with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is similar to that for most beta-blockers. The precise role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the central nervous system is not well defined. Most thiazide diuretics are not associated with major complications of the central nervous system, although electrolyte imbalance may occasionally lead to complaints of neurologic symptoms. Because the incidence of central nervous system effects with these three classes of drugs is so low, concern for the side effects of the central nervous system is not a prime consideration in the choice of an initial antihypertensive agent.\r"

In animal models, hypertension appears to induce a sequence of changes in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial permeability. However, increased lipid deposition in the intima and acceleration of atherosclerosis appear to require elevation of plasma lipid levels. Some beta-blockers have been found to retard the development of atherosclerosis in the cholesterol-fed rabbit model.

Long-term treatment with metoprolol resulted in significant reductions of total and cardiovascular mortality or morbidity due to decreased incidence of coronary and cerebrovascular complications both in a primary prevention trial in hypertensive patients and in a secondary prevention trial in patients surviving myocardial infarction. The observations suggest that a retardation of atherosclerosis development might have contributed to the reduced incidence of cardiovascular complications. An antiatherosclerotic effect of beta-blockers has been directly demonstrated in animal studies. In cholesterol-fed rabbits, metoprolol significantly reduced the development of atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic intima in the absence of any changes in blood lipids. Similar findings were reported for propranolol, which prevented psychosocial stress-induced atherosclerosis of the coronary artery in monkeys. Furthermore, beta-blockers have been shown to prevent stress-induced endothelial injury and platelet accumulation to intima at atherosclerotic predilection sites in animal models. These antiatherogenic effects may be due to biochemical and hemodynamic factors. Two biochemical effects of beta-blockade may lead to reduced cholesterol accumulation in arterial intima at unchanged serum cholesterol levels. One is a beta-blocker-induced increase of prostacyclin biosynthesis, and the other a metabolic change of low-density lipoprotein, reducing its potential for deposition in the arterial wall. The antiatherogenic effect of these factors may be reinforced by beta-blocker-induced hemodynamic changes leading to reductions of arterial flow aberrations and pressure-related wall stress.\r"

Blood pressures were nearly identical in the two treatment groups. During the 3 years, 11 patients died in the placebo group and seven died in the metoprolol group. Occurrence of nonfatal events was also higher in the placebo than in the treated group: 12 patients vs one patient for reinfarction (p less than 0.005), three patients vs no patients for coronary artery bypass grafting, four patients vs no patients for cerebrovascular events, and one patient vs no patients for lower limb amputation. The total number of patients with any event was 24 vs eight (p less than 0.01).

In a controlled, randomized, stratified primary prevention study (n = 3234; 16,180 patient-years) in white men (40 to 64 years old) with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension, a treatment schedule starting antihypertensive treatment with metoprolol was compared with treatment starting with a thiazide diuretic. The two treatment groups were well matched in blood pressure and other major clinical characteristics at randomization, as well as at the last follow-up during treatment. Total mortality was significantly lower in patients randomized to metoprolol. At the median follow-up time (4.2 years) 28 deaths occurred in the metoprolol group and 54 in the diuretic group--a difference of 48% in total mortality (95% confidence limit, ranging from 68% to 17%), mainly because of a highly significant reduction in coronary heart disease at this point in time. The benefit demonstrated with metoprolol seems to have important implications for clinical practice and public health policy, since hypertension and coronary heart disease are major health problems worldwide.\r"

As evidenced by animal and human studies, catecholamines are an important mediator between psychologic factors and cardiovascular physiology, but direct measurement of catecholamine levels has not proved useful. Measurement of hemodynamic variables--blood pressure, heart rate, and stroke volume--during standardized psychophysiologic challenges is advocated. With low-challenge standardized stressors that include alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimuli, inappropriate reactors can be classified according to whether blood pressure is elevated primarily by cardiac output, total systemic resistance, or a combination of both. Hypertensive patients can be similarly distinguished, and medication can then be custom-tailored to the underlying physiology. Extensive laboratory and clinical evidence points to significant interrelationships between the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, cardiovascular physiologic and metabolic perturbances are distinctly different under conditions of mental vs physical stress. Most clinical testing assesses physical performance whereas the real-life challenges of today are primarily mental.\r"

Several plausible explanations, including hemodynamic hypotheses, have been put forth to account for the failure of treatment to more favorably influence mortality from ischemic heart disease. The effect of hypertension on coronary heart disease is probably much more complex than a simple elevation of arterial pressure. Some of these complexities include the potential separate risks of high total peripheral resistance, high cardiac output, increased myocardial power that reflects pressure times flow, and several structural and functional vascular changes. These factors may act in concert to unfavorably alter the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Several of these factors will be highlighted in an attempt to offer alternative or adjunctive pathophysiologic examinations for the high-risk subgroups of obesity and the failure of antihypertensive therapy to normalize the rate of coronary heart disease events.\r"

  ".W": "The early phase of hypertension (borderline hypertension) is characterized by a hyperkinetic circulation caused by excessive sympathetic drive and decreased parasympathetic inhibition to the heart. In later phases the cardiac output becomes normal, but the hypertension is still neurogenic, as demonstrated by the fact that continued pharmacologic parasympathetic, beta- and alpha-adrenergic inhibition normalizes the blood pressure. In both of these phases of the process, plasma norepinephrine values are elevated. These patients also show characteristic behavioral patterns; they are outward oriented, submissive, but experience unexpressed anger and frequently harbor hostile feelings. In late phases of hypertension the cardiac output is normal and the total peripheral resistance is elevated. This hemodynamic transition can be explained by a secondary response to elevated blood pressure. The heart becomes less responsive as a result of altered receptor responsiveness and decreased cardiac compliance, whereas the responsiveness of arterioles increases because of vascular hypertrophy, which leads to changes in the wall-to-lumen ratio. However, one observation eludes explanation: the absence of plasma norepinephrine elevation in later phases of hypertension. We propose a new conceptual framework to explain the disappearance of elevated plasma norepinephrine in the course of hypertension. The concept is based on a wide range of observations with the use of various receptor-blocking agents during neurogenic pressor responses. Invariably, the blood pressure response is preserved, but the hemodynamic pattern can be altered from a high cardiac output to high total peripheral resistance or vice versa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The abnormal distribution of plasma renin values described in established essential hypertension are also found in patients with very early, borderline hypertension. In established hypertension, renin values have been used to draw inferences about the pathophysiology of blood pressure elevation. Within this concept, the low-renin state is considered a volume-dependent (volume expanded) form of hypertension. The high-renin state is viewed as high-resistance hypertension caused by a renin-dependent vasoconstriction. However, the pathophysiology of high- and low-renin borderline hypertension does not follow the prediction from the volume-vasoconstriction theory. The high-renin state is often associated with an increase in cardiac output and normal values of vascular resistance. Even when the cardiac output is normal and the total peripheral resistance is elevated in high renin, the vasoconstriction is not renin-angiotensin dependent. The high-renin borderline and mild hypertension is a state of generalized, increased, sympathetic drive to the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. After the influence of the autonomic nervous system is removed by pharmacologic blockade, blood pressure in patients with high-renin values becomes normal. To the contrary, pharmacologic antagonization of angiotensin II with a converting enzyme inhibitor does not lead to normal blood pressure values in patients with high-renin. Patients with borderline hypertension with low renin have normal plasma and blood volume values. However, because of decreased compliance of the peripheral capacitance space, the blood volume is shifted from the peripheral to the central (cardiopulmonary) portion of the circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Any adverse response to nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic therapies can negatively influence some aspect of the patient's sense of well-being and life satisfaction; this will likely limit the compliance with and the resultant benefits of therapy. The diagnosis of hypertension itself is associated with psychological consequences, termed the \"labeling effect,\" that impair life quality. A number of life-style modifications and a variety of highly effective and safe classes of antihypertensive agents can satisfactorily control blood pressure in most patients. Evaluation of the patient's response to an antihypertensive regimen should, in addition to measurement of the level of blood pressure and review of laboratory test values, include assessment of quality of life outcomes: impact of therapy on the patient's daily routine, fatigue or activity limitation, sexual dysfunction, impairment of memory, alertness, mood, or cognitive ability, sleep dysfunction, work performance and satisfaction, and satisfaction with family, social, and leisure time activities.\r"

Furthermore, we related these effects to baseline neural tone and its changes and assessed the efficacy of relaxation or the pressor surge of \"social stress\" anger. In group I left ventricular mass index was related to both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.46; p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine was related to age (r = 0.33; p less than 0.01). Slope was inversely related to both plasma norepinephrine (r = -0.29; p less than 0.05) and age (r = -0.31; p less than 0.05). Relaxation therapy reduced both supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures, 4.5% and 7.6%, respectively, but did not affect plasma norepinephrine. Hygienic informational therapy reduced plasma norepinephrine by 18%, (p less than 0.05) and did not change blood pressure. Blood pressure responders to nondrug therapy (i.e., diastolic blood pressure reduction of 7% or more) had a 7% reduction of left ventricular mass index (p less than 0.02). On the other hand, atenolol reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 10% and 15%, respectively, (p less than 0.01) and improved left ventricular function by 17% (p less than 0.05) without a significant change in left ventricular mass index. Finally, relaxation therapy but not hygienic therapy reduced systolic blood pressures 4% and 6%, respectively (p less than 0.01), both before and during social stress anger.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Reliable, totally noninvasive methods are now available that measure cardiac output accurately enough under a variety of conditions, including rest, exercise, and pharmacologic interventions. These methods include echocardiography, Doppler echocardiography, CO2 rebreathing, and impedance cardiography. Their serial application to large numbers of patients offers the opportunity to significantly broaden our understanding of the spectrum and course of hemodynamic alterations associated with hypertension. A more complete knowledge of underlying hemodynamics could improve our diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in hypertensive patients and enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension and the mechanism of action of antihypertensive interventions.\r"

Reactivity testing is ideally suited for evaluating individual differences in susceptibility to the acute effects of stressors but cannot resolve the question regarding whether stressors in everyday life contribute to a sustained elevation of pressure. Although several associations between increased reactivity and hypertension have been demonstrated, they do not necessarily imply a primary role for behavioral factors. Ambulatory monitoring is ideally suited for studying the effects of everyday stressors and has shown that blood pressure may increase as a result of occupational stress. On the grounds that hypertension results from an interaction of genetic and environmental factors, it is argued that both techniques have their place and that the role of psychosocial factors can best be demonstrated by prospective studies of persons exposed to different levels of stress.\r"

In this placebo-controlled crossover trial, patients received probucol or placebo for 8 weeks, then switched to the other agent for another 8 weeks. Probucol significantly lowered total, low-density lipoprotein and HDL cholesterol levels. HDL subfractions, separated by rate zonal ultracentrifugation, showed a dramatic reduction in HDL2, whereas changes in HDL3 were not significant. Both subfractions eluted at a characteristically lower volume, indicating a reduced flotation rate. These findings were confirmed by gradient gel electrophoretic separation, which showed a typical reduction or disappearance of HDL2b particles and the prevalence of particles in the HDL3a-HDL3b electrophoretic range in almost all patients. After treatment, cholesteryl ester transfer from HDL to lower density lipoproteins was significantly increased in all patients. These data suggest that probucol may accelerate HDL particle conversion, leading to improvement in reverse cholesterol transport from the periphery to the liver, through HDL and very low density lipoprotein.\r"

In such conditions, more than 80% of different carcinomas, sarcomas, melanomas, and lymphomas were positive for AACT. The results indicate that AACT immunoreactivity is not specific for histiocytic tumors and therefore cannot be used as a histiocytic marker and to substantiate the concept of histiocytic nature of tumors, such as malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The concept of AACT as a histiocytic marker may be based on the fact that histiocytes, for some reason, stain more intensively for AACT, and immunoreactivity can also be found in them at unoptimal immunostaining conditions.\r"

Immunostaining with paraffin-embedded specimens revealed that proliferating cells of neoplastic nodules possessed the same monoclonal immunoglobulins as those in the serum (IgM, kappa in three and IgM, gamma in one). The plasma cells around neoplastic nodules contained the same monoclonal immunoglobulins as those in the nodules in two cases. In the remainder, most plasma cells around the nodules possessed the same immunoglobulins as those in the nodules. The authors consider these plasma cells to be the cause of paraproteinemia. Immunostaining with paraffin and frozen tissue sections revealed that the neoplastic cells (or neoplastic nodules) were positive for sIgD, sIgM, dendritic reticulum cell antigen (DRC-1), and LN-2 and weakly positive for common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen (CALLA), and LN-1. These results indicate that the neoplastic cells of MZL have both phenotypes of mantle zone lymphocytes (sIgD, sIgM, and LN-2 positive) and of germinal center cells (sIgM, DRC-1, CALLA, and LN-1 positive). MZL is thus considered to be a neoplasma of B-cells differentiating from mantle zone lymphocytes to germinal center cells.\r"

A popular strategy is to obtain a manual differential if any part of the automated blood count and differential is outside specified limits (the \"diff-if\" strategy). The authors compared two sets of criteria to triage blood counts for manual differentials: previously recommended numeric values, and the analysis of a microcomputer program. In a population of subjects with a high percentage of hematologic disorders, the microcomputer program and the numeric criteria were equally specific (excluding normal blood smears); the program was more sensitive for bands, immature granulocytes, monocytes, nucleated red blood cells, reticulocytosis, teardrops, red blood cell fragments, and hypersegmented neutrophils. The numeric criteria were more sensitive for eosinophilia (less than 1.0 X 10(9)/L) and mandated fewer manual differentials. In a population of predominantly normal subjects, the program was more sensitive for increased bands and equally sensitive for eosinophilia, the only abnormalities observed on the smear. In a population of subjects with predominantly abnormal blood counts, but excluding most primary hematologic disorders, there were few blood smears with abnormalities beyond eosinophilia or increased bands. In both of these groups, the computer program mandated more manual differentials than did the numeric criteria. The authors conclude that microcomputer analysis by the program tested was more sensitive than numeric criteria to identify specimens with abnormal blood smears. Specificity depended on the patient population. The choice of a triage strategy should be based on the individual laboratory's patient population.\r"

The DFA technique was shown to be much less expensive than the EIA method and also required at least 50% less time to generate a final result. When compared with an indirect fluorescent antibody technique, the EIA technique was more sensitive (87%) than the DFA method (81%). Both methods showed 100% specificity.

The authors' recommendation is that the eight weeks' incubation guidelines for all mycobacterial cultures and especially for the BACTEC TB be comprehensively reviewed to determine clinical relevance and cost effectiveness of incubation of the BACTEC TB vial beyond five weeks.\r"

Thirty-one children who were not pretreated were bacteremic. Compared with nonbacteremic children who were not pretreated, bacteremic children were younger, more often had a history of upper respiratory tract infection and fever, had a higher white blood cell count and temperature at admission, and more often had a violaceous cellulitis. No difference between groups existed in the frequency of a history of trauma or a local lesion near the affected eye. Tear specimens from 13 of 89 children tested by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) to detect Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide were positive.

Few clinical features distinguished infants with prenatal injury from those without such injuries. Apgar scores were low, seizures were rare, and acute intracranial hemorrhage occurred equally often in both groups. Few pregnancies were entirely normal, but hydramnios was the only factor that occurred more often in prenatally injured infants, a statistically significant difference only among term infants. Oligohydramnios was not associated with prenatal brain injury. Unless fetal/maternal abnormalities in late gestation are identified and corrected, improved neonatal care will increase survival for prenatally damaged infants and the incidence of cerebral palsy may rise.\r"

Patients were treated predominantly by the retrograde method after initial esophageal dilatation. Laser therapy was effective in restoring esophageal luminal patency. However, luminal patency did not guarantee restoration of adequate oral nutritional intake. Twenty-seven percent of patients required additional nutritional support. Twenty-six percent of procedures were complicated by significant events, predominantly cardiorespiratory. Six deaths occurred within 30 days of laser therapy. Mean survival from time of first laser therapy was 16 wk. We conclude that laser therapy of malignant esophageal obstruction provides effective palliation of dysphasia; however, in older patients with advanced disease, this therapy often results in complications, as do other methods of treatment for this condition.\r"

There was no significant difference between control subjects and ICP in the motility of SO. In ICP, there was no correlation between the PP and the motility of SO. In ALCP and GSCP, the frequencies of the papillary sphincter waves were significantly higher than in normal subjects, and there were correlations between the PP and the motility of SO. These data suggest that increased pancreatic ductal pressure in GSCP with papillitis or ALCP may be due in part to papillary dysfunction, but not in ICP.\r"

The mean urinary pseudouridine concentration was significantly higher in the patients with hepatoma [38.2 +/- 12.8 (SD) nmol/mumol creatinine] than in those with liver cirrhosis (20.3 +/- 6.8), chronic hepatitis (24.4 +/- 8.2), and acute hepatitis (21.7 +/- 8.2), and in healthy subjects (23.8 +/- 4.9). Urinary pseudouridine level was elevated above the mean value plus 2 SD for the healthy subjects (33.6 nmol/mumol creatinine) in 71% of our hepatoma cases. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels correlated poorly with urinary pseudouridine levels, thus, the combination assay for urinary pseudouridine and serum alpha-fetoprotein could detect 79% of the patients with hepatoma.

Recent innovations in care, including preoperative parenteral nutrition, topical care for bullae and skin ulceration, fiberoptic tracheal intubation, electrocardiogram monitoring with metallic pacer leads, and an overall concern to protect the fragile intact skin, have improved the results of esophageal replacement. Utilizing these adjunctive measures, ileocolonic substernal interposition has been successfully performed in a 26-yr-old male and a 19-yr-old female at our institution. Despite cervical anastomotic stricture requiring resection in one, and an obstructive cervical esophageal bullous developing acutely 5 yr after operation in the second, both patients now gum or chew a solid diet. The first patient also benefited from total esophagectomy for squamous dysplasia detected at the time of esophageal replacement. Multidisciplinary management by the surgeon, gastroenterologist, anesthesiologist, and dermatologist makes esophageal replacement available for younger patients with epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica recessive and esophageal strictures.\r"

Results of the pooled data and the wide scatter therein suggest that none of these tests is sufficiently sensitive or specific for use as a screening test in clinical practice. There is some evidence that nutritional supplementation or antithrombotic agents might reduce the incidence of preeclampsia, but the data are not conclusive. In addition, the data do not suggest any benefit in perinatal outcome from the use of antihypertensive therapy in such pregnancies. The findings suggest that there is a definite need for standardization regarding definition, terminology, and diagnosis and for large multicenter clinical trials. Finally, there is an urgent need to identify a marker of preeclampsia.\r"

Isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (Amniostat-FLM). All species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. The material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. Gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. Colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. The possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The association between reproductive failure and abnormal autoimmune function has been recognized for decades in association with such established autoimmune diseases as systemic lupus erythematosus. Recent investigations have expanded this association to women who demonstrate similar humoral abnormalities as patients with defined autoimmune diseases but do not express any of the clinical symptoms required for the diagnosis of an autoimmune disease. The observation that abnormal autoimmune function in clinically asymptomatic patients can lead to reproductive failure has led us to define the reproductive autoimmune failure syndrome as a diagnostic entity. The present article summarizes evidence suggesting that the occurrence of reproductive autoimmune failure syndrome may be teleologically related to the woman's need for increased self-tolerance in face of antigenic exposure to the maternal haplotype of the fetus during normal pregnancy. This need for increased self-tolerance is documented by higher normal autoantibody levels in women than in men and may also be responsible for the highly increased incidence of autoimmune diseases in women in comparison with men. Under this concept, abnormal autoimmune function may lead to reproductive failure at different stages of the reproductive process, depending on the quality and possibly quantity of the abnormal autoimmune response.\r"

After a 2-month period of significant maternal hyperglycemia, no relationship between concentrations of fetal glucose and insulin could be detected. The mean fetal glucose concentration was 3.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/L in the hyperglycemic group and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmol/L in the control group. Mean fetal insulin levels were 12.5 +/- 1.4 and 10.7 +/- 1.3 microU/ml, respectively. The neonatal lambs of the hyperglycemic and control ewes showed comparable concentrations of glucose and insulin after infusion of glucose. It is presumed that persistent high glucose levels depress the insulin secreting capacity of the fetal pancreas.\r"

The study population included 82 patients in the third trimester of pregnancy, 47 of whom had uncomplicated gestations, while 35 had insulin-dependent diabetes. In uncomplicated pregnancies a distal femoral epiphysis measuring greater than or equal to 3 mm in the axial plane or the sonographic identification of a proximal tibial epiphysis of any dimension correlated with pulmonic maturity. The combination of a distal femoral epiphysis greater than or equal to 3 mm and the presence of a proximal tibial epiphysis was highly correlated with a lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio greater than or equal to 2:1 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 63%, negative predictive value 100%, and false-negative rate 0%). The Kappa value (K) for testing the agreement between ultrasound results and amniocentesis results was 0.39 (p less than 0.002). In diabetic pregnancies neither a distal femoral epiphysis greater than or equal to 3 mm nor a proximal tibial epiphysis of any dimension correlated precisely with the presence of phosphatidyl glycerol in the amniotic fluid. However, the combination of a distal femoral epiphysis greater than or equal to 3 mm and a proximal tibial epiphysis greater than or equal to 2 mm improved the prediction of phosphatidyl glycerol (sensitivity 83%, specificity 79%, negative predictive value 96%, false-negative rate 17%). The K value in this instance was 0.36 (p greater than or equal to 0.19). It is concluded that the sonographic assessment of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses and their dimensions in the axial plane may be useful as markers for pulmonic maturity in uncomplicated pregnancies.\r"

No similar correlation was found among a selected population of healthy pregnant women (r = -0.129). Because the level of glycosylated hemoglobin in pregnancy correlates with poor outcome, including the occurrence of fetal anomaly, it may be important to quantify glycosylated hemoglobin in pregnancies with low alpha-fetoprotein levels. These results also suggest that the maternal concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin can be used to adjust serum alpha-fetoprotein values before their interpretation in the screening of pregnant women with diabetes.\r"

A nonexercising age-height-weight--matched group was monitored as a control. All three groups were of above-average fitness for age as measured by aerobic capacity during initial testing. The treadmill group significantly increased its maximal oxygen uptake over the training period. Glucose tolerance and insulin response, measured as areas under the curve after a 75 gm oral glucose load, were improved in both exercise groups compared with controls, with more marked improvement in the treadmill group. The only difference achieving statistical significance was the insulin levels 30 minutes or less after glucose ingestion, representing the first phase of insulin release. Long-term exercise training that increases aerobic power thus maintains normoglycemia with lower insulin values than in otherwise physically fit postmenopausal women.\r"

  ".W": "Between June 1981 and December 1985, 296 evaluable patients with carcinoma of the cervix (stages IIB, III, or IVA) were randomized to radiation therapy and either hydroxyurea (139 patients) or misonidazole (157 patients). All patients had undergone clinical, radiographic, and surgical staging. Patients with metastasis to periaortic nodes were ineligible for study. Patients received external radiation therapy to the pelvis and either one or two intracavitary applications. Hydroxyurea was given in a dose of 80 mg/kg each Monday and Thursday during external radiation therapy. Misonidazole was given in a dose of 1 gm/m2 in the same schedule, not to exceed 12 gm/m2. Of the evaluable patients, 60.8% had stage IIB disease and 33.8% had stage IIIB disease. Negative pelvic lymph nodes were found in 79.2% of the patients. Median age was 49 years (first and third quartiles 40 and 60, respectively). There were 51 patients who had severe and 15 patients who had life-threatening adverse effects (including two treatment-related deaths). As of February 1987 half the patients have either failed or been followed-up for at least 43 months. The group treated with hydroxyurea had a longer progression-free interval, bordering on statistical significance, than those treated with misonidazole (p = 0.08). The median progression-free interval for all patients randomized to hydroxyurea is 42.9 months and for misonidazole it is 40.4 months. The median progression-free interval for patients with stage III and IV disease who received hydroxyurea has not been reached and for the misonidazole group it was 10.1 months. There have been 120 recurrences, 51 (36.7%) in the hydroxyurea group and 69 (43.9%) in the misonidazole group; 51.7% of the recurrences have been limited to the pelvis or vagina. Failure limited to the pelvis occurred in 18.0% of patients receiving hydroxyurea and 23.6% of patients receiving misonidazole. There were 108 deaths, 47 (33.8%) in the hydroxyurea group and 61 (38.9%) in the misonidazole group; survival does not differ statistically between the two regimens at this point in follow-up (p = 0.25). Hydroxyurea has more short-term gastrointestinal and marrow toxicity, but is free of long-term neurotoxicity. Preliminary analyses indicate that there is no role for radiation therapy with misonidazole in cervical carcinoma.\r"

In 31 corneas the abnormal accumulations did not react with any of the antikeratan sulfate antibodies, but 18 corneas reacted with all of the antibodies. The remaining corneas reacted with various combinations of the antibodies. The data suggest that the accumulations in macular corneal dystrophy are not always identical and that keratan sulfate is present in some cases but not in others. Thus, based on differences in the storage material, macular corneal dystrophy appears to manifest heterogeneity with at least two distinct varieties: keratan sulfate negative (type 1) and keratan sulfate positive (type 2).\r"

  ".W": "The pattern of cytokeratins expressed in normal urothelium has been compared with that of various forms of transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs; 21 cases) and cultured bladder carcinoma cell lines, using immunolocalization and gel electrophoretic techniques. In normal urothelium, all simple-epithelium-type cytokeratins (polypeptides 7, 8, 18, 19) were detected in all cell layers, whereas antibodies to cytokeratins typical for stratified epithelia reacted with certain basal cells only or, in the case of cytokeratin 13, with cells of the basal and intermediate layers. This pattern was essentially maintained in low-grade (G1, G1/2) TCCs but was remarkably modified in G2 TCCs. In G3 TCCs simple-epithelial cytokeratins were predominant whereas the amounts of component 13 were greatly reduced. Squamous metaplasia was accompanied generally by increased or new expression of some stratified-epithelial cytokeratins. The cytokeratin patterns of cell culture lines RT-112 and RT-4 resembled those of G1 and G2 TCCs, whereas cell line T-24 was comparable to G3 carcinomas. The cell line EJ showed a markedly different pattern. The results indicate that, in the cell layers of the urothelium, the synthesis of stratification-related cytokeratins such as component 13 is inversely oriented compared with that in other stratified epithelia where these proteins are suprabasally expressed, that TCCs retain certain intrinsic cytoskeletal features of urothelium, and that different TCCs can be distinguished by their cytokeratin patterns. The potential value of these observations in histopathologic and cytologic diagnoses is discussed.\r"

During an immunohistochemical study of the expression of growth factors and receptors in human soft tissue tumors (STT), only 1 antisera capable of working in paraffin-embedded tissue was noted. A detailed study of 141 STT was undertaken to determine the frequency of expression of nerve growth factor receptor (NGF-R), its specificity and sensitivity for neural tumors, and the effect of fixation on detection. In normal mesenchymal tissue, only nerve sheath and perivascular staining was seen. No immunoreactivity was seen in many tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, liposarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and alveolar soft part sarcoma. Less than 15% of tumors of smooth muscle, fibrous, or fibrohistiocytic origin showed immunoreactivity, usually focal. In contrast, a high frequency of immunoreactivity was noted in tumors of neural origin (74%). This included granular cell tumors (100%), Schwannoma/neurofibroma (91%), malignant Schwannoma (78%), neuroblastoma/neuroepithelioma (60%), and paraganglioma (57%). A high rate of reactivity was also seen in synovial sarcomas (80%), undifferentiated sarcomas (60%), and hemangiopericytomas (43%), suggesting a potential relationship to the neural phenotype. Among the neural tumors, Bouin's fixation was superior to formalin, suggesting that immunoreactivity for NGF-R is affected by fixation. This antibody may be a useful adjunct marker diagnostically.\r"

Lesser degrees of Congophilic change were observed in cerebrovascular malformations screened from 4 of 10 patients between the ages of 30 and 59. No Congophilic change was seen in 10 cerebrovascular malformations removed from patients under 30 years of age. Congophilic areas in all cases decorated with W-2 and 85/45 polyclonal antibodies raised to peptide sequences of cerebrovascular beta-amyloid and beta-amyloid of senile plaques from patients with Alzheimer's disease. Thus, the amyloid in these vascular malformations is immunologically related to beta-amyloid protein. This finding provides another indication that vascular beta-amyloid deposition is not specific for Alzheimer's disease and suggests that an existing abnormality of vessels may be a predisposing factor.\r"

The bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) forms a local immune system that normally protects the lung from infection. The effects of lung transplantation and lung allograft rejection on the BALT were examined using immunoperoxidase techniques. The BALT was evaluated by quantifying the number of immunoglobulin-bearing plasma cells in the lamina propria of sections of trachea and mainstem bronchus. Sections of donor mainstem bronchus from 2 patients with allograft rejection were compared with sections of native trachea from these same patients, and with sections of mainstem bronchus from 2 transplanted lungs without rejection and 20 controls. Lung allografts from the 2 patients with rejection had a marked depletion of submucosal IgA-bearing and IgG-bearing plasma cells. Two sets of transplanted lungs without evidence of rejection showed only a mild reduction of the BALT. The depletion of BALT associated with allograft rejection may contribute to the increased incidence of pulmonary infections seen in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "In an overview of the research on psychiatric decision making in the emergency room, the authors discuss studies done between 1963 and 1977, which suffered from an overreliance on univariate statistical techniques, problems with the reliability and validity of the instruments used for data collection, and the lack of alternatives to hospitalization for emergency room patients. More recent studies of emergency room decision making are then reviewed, with particular attention to those that had multivariate statistical designs. The article concludes with a synthesis of the research findings to date and recommends multivariate approaches and choices of variables for future studies.\r"

With the introduction of lithium, however, manic-depressive illness became susceptible to treatment and gained attractiveness as a diagnosis. The ambiguous position of patients with schizoaffective disorder became clear. Cross-sectionally they were seen to resemble schizophrenic patients, but longitudinally they were more akin to patients with affective disorder. Numerous studies have attempted to establish that they are diagnostically distinct, but without clear results. The authors suggest that schizoaffective disorder is heterogeneous and that its treatment should be determined by specific indices as to its subtype.\r"

In addition, the incidence of dystonia and the efficacy of anticholinergic prophylaxis were related inversely to age. These results support the efficacy of anticholinergic agents in preventing neuroleptic-induced dystonia, particularly in young male patients treated with high-potency neuroleptics.\r"

The Doppler ultrasound examination in experienced hands can be extremely reliable and rapid in diagnosing the condition. During an 18 month period, we used the Doppler examination to diagnose iliofemoral venous thrombosis in 21 patients, 15 of whom had corroboration by venogram. The key to successful treatment and avoidance of significant complications was early and accurate diagnosis by the Doppler examination. No patient underwent operation or progressed to venous gangrene. Six were treated with streptokinase and the rest, with intravenous heparin, leg elevation, and stockings. We believe that iliofemoral venous thrombosis is a much more common disease than previously recognized and should be vigorously diagnosed and treated when a patient presents with a symptomatic extremity. The Doppler ultrasound examination represents a rapid, reliable alternative to the venogram in the early diagnosis of iliofemoral venous thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "Mediastinal masses occur in both men and women of every age, and close to half of affected patients are asymptomatic. Screening of asymptomatic persons is not economically feasible. Symptomatic patients should be evaluated initially with posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs. Additional imaging techniques may be required in patients suspected of having a mediastinal mass, when there is a questionable abnormality seen on chest radiographs or when local or systemic symptoms suggest a mediastinal mass. These techniques include oblique views, over-penetrated radiographs, and fluoroscopy of the chest. Computerized tomography of the chest is the imaging modality of choice for further assessment of a mediastinal mass. It can also be an important adjunct in radiotherapy portal planning. The use of other imaging modalities depends on the location of the tumor, the equipment available, and the expertise of local radiologists. In following up treated patients for disease recurrence, periodic chest radiographs are usually sufficient. Computerized tomography scans, because of their expense, should only be obtained as a baseline after completion of therapy or in patients with a suspected relapse.\r"

Of the agents for which serum drug concentrations are routinely available, the aminoglycosides theophylline, vancomycin, digoxin, and phenytoin are used most frequently in surgical patients. When using serum drug concentrations, the clinician should have an understanding of the relationships (or lack of) between drug concentrations and therapeutic or toxic effects. When blood is collected for serum concentration determinations, the exact timing of the sample in relation to the dose must be considered. For some drugs, (such as the aminoglycosides, it is necessary to determine peak and trough concentrations, whereas for other agents, like theophylline, the average or mid-dose level may be more important to consider. There are many factors that affect serum drug concentrations. Among these are various disease states, obesity, fluid imbalances, the drug dosage form used, and concurrent drug use. Not all patients require serum drug concentration monitoring; however, with each drug there are high-risk patients who may benefit. When used properly, serum drug concentrations may be helpful in maximizing therapeutic benefits, minimizing or diagnosing drug toxicity, and assessing patient compliance with drug regimens.\r"

To study the effects of multiple therapeutic interventions, a stable model of pulmonary hypertension in sheep was developed using continuous infusion of the vasoconstrictor U46619, a thromboxane A2-mimetic. The pulmonary and systemic effects of four pulmonary vasodilators (prostaglandin E1, isoproterenol, prostacyclin, and nifedipine) were compared at doses producing equivalent reduction in systemic blood pressure. Although all four drugs decreased pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, distinct differences in drug hemodynamic profiles were found. Prostaglandin E1 and isoproterenol demonstrated the greatest pulmonary specificity, increased cardiac output significantly, and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance. Prostaglandin E1 produced the largest decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (from 31 +/- 1 to 22 +/- 2 mm Hg). Isoproterenol markedly increased heart rate (from 119 +/- 6 to 182 +/- 10 beats/min) and resulted in significant dysrhythmias that necessitated limiting infusion of this drug; isoproterenol did not affect stroke volume. Prostacyclin demonstrated intermediate pulmonary specificity and produced the largest increase in cardiac output (from 1.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.1 +/- 0.3 L/min). Nifedipine exhibited the least pulmonary specificity and was the least effective agent in decreasing pulmonary artery pressure. In this model different pulmonary vasodilators exerted different hemodynamic effects, suggesting that appropriate drug selection for treatment of pulmonary hypertension should depend on baseline heart rate and rhythm, pulmonary artery pressure, systemic artery pressure, arterial oxygenation, and cardiac output.\r"

In early presentations (less than 42 days gestation), 38% of ultrasound examinations and 89% of culdocenteses performed were positive. In late presentations, 93% of ultrasound examinations and 70% of culdocenteses performed were positive. The difference between the modalities' performance was significant (P less than .05) for both early and late presentations. These data could provide the basis for a prospective study to test the hypothesis that culdocentesis is the diagnostic test of choice in early suspected ectopic pregnancy, whereas ultrasound is more likely to yield clinically useful information in patients presenting after six weeks gestation.\r"

Three groups of experimental animals were studied. One group had hepatectomy without a shunt and was compared with two other groups which had hepatectomy with some form of venovenous shunting. Systemic arterial blood pressure, portal and inferior vena caval pressure, urinary output, and renal histology were all better maintained when a shunt was used.\r"

The presence of considerable intersubject and intrasubject heterogeneity suggests that subtypes of the disease exist. We define subtypes of Alzheimer disease in regard to the behavioral features (for example, predominant right or left hemisphere, or symmetrical impairment), inheritance (familial or sporadic), dosage of chromosome 21 (presence of the Down syndrome), time course of progression, age of onset (presenile or senile), and presence or absence of motor deficit (myoclonus or signs of an extrapyramidal syndrome). Studies of regional cerebral glucose metabolism with positron emission tomography and [18-fluorine] fluorodeoxyglucose show focal alterations in glucose use, with cerebral metabolic asymmetries in patients with Alzheimer disease that are related to the nature of the cognitive deficit. Serial roentgenographic computed tomographic studies show heterogeneous rates of lateral ventricle enlargement in the disease that are related to rates of cognitive decline. Similar anatomic and physiologic abnormalities are also found in persons 45 years of age or older who have the Down syndrome. Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer disease who have extrapyramidal dysfunction or myoclonus are a distinct subgroup, with specific abnormalities of central monoamine markers of dopamine metabolism, serotonin metabolism, and the hydroxylation cofactor, biopterin. The concept of subtypes in Alzheimer disease serves as a model with which the interactions of genetic influences with environmental factors can be examined.\r"

Resistance to beta-lactams, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines was transferable to Escherichia coli by conjugation and was lost en bloc after treatment with ethidium bromide. Agarose gel electrophoresis of wild types and transconjugants indicated that these resistances were mediated by a 150-kilobase plasmid, pCFF14. The strains constitutively produced a beta-lactamase with isoelectric point close to 5.6 and which had a higher Vmax for ceftazidime and cephalothin than for cefotaxime. The substrate profile and isoelectric point of this enzyme thus differ from those of other known plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including the broad-spectrum enzyme CTX-1. Hybridization studies support the derivation of the novel enzyme from a TEM-type beta-lactamase.\r"

The inhibition of virus production was observed in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells both by reverse transcriptase assay and virus-antigen assay. In addition, rifabutin effectively reduced human immunodeficiency virus type 1-associated cytopathic effect to OKT4-positive cells. Virion-associated reverse transcriptase was also markedly inhibited by rifabutin. The inhibitory dose of rifabutin was nontoxic to lymphoid cells, which further suggests that it might serve as a useful agent in the therapeutic modalities of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "A laboratory-derived mutant of Candida albicans B311 (L) and a clinical isolate (C) of C. albicans, both lacking membrane ergosterol, were less susceptible to amphotericin B (AmB)-induced cell membrane permeability to K+ and lethality than was the wild-type laboratory strain (B311) which contained ergosterol. The resistance of L and C to AmB-induced killing was much greater than the level of resistance to AmB-induced cell membrane permeability. L and C were also less susceptible to killing by H2O2 than was B311, and when treated with menadione, they each produced less H2O2 than did B311. In addition, their levels of catalase activity were 3.8-fold (L) and 2-fold (C) higher than that of B311. The ergosterol deficiency in L and C probably impaired AmB binding to the cells, thereby lowering AmB effectiveness as measured by both cell membrane permeability and killing. Resistance of strains L and C to oxidation-dependent damage likely contributed to a diminished response to AmB-induced lethality.\r"

Antibiotic-induced inhibition of incorporation of [3H]leucine into the cells in the biofilm was far less pronounced than incorporation into planktonic cells and, furthermore, correlated well with loss in viable counts.

Fluorescence polarization immunoassay and time-resolved fluorescence using the lanthanides are two of the newer fluorescence techniques. Luminescent labels, such as acridinium esters, show promise because of their stability, sensitivity, and ease of detection. Several new particle label techniques have been introduced, perhaps two of the most interesting of which are sol particle and liposome labels. Advantages and disadvantages of the newer labels are compared with those of radioactivity.\r"

We seem to have anticipated, in 1980, the findings of the GPEP panel by formulating and starting to test the hypothesis that certain \"core\" information in medical curricula can be as effectively delivered by technology-based self-study means as by lecture or formal laboratory. We began, at that time, to prepare a series of self-study materials using, at first, videotape and then computer-controlled optical videodiscs. The content area selected for study was basic microscopic pathology. The series was planned to cover the following areas of study: cellular alterations and adaptations, cell injury, acute inflammation, chronic inflammation and wound healing, cellular accumulations, circulatory disturbances, necrosis, and neoplasia. All are intended to provide learning experiences in basic pathology. The first two programs were released for testing in 1983 as a two-sided videodisc accompanied by computer-driven pretests, study modules, and posttests that used Apple computers and Pioneer (DiscoVision) videodisc players. An MS DOS (eg, IBM) version of the computer programs was released in 1984. The first two programs are now used in 57 US, Canadian, European, and Philippine health professions schools, and over 1300 student and faculty evaluations have been received. Student and faculty evaluations of these first two programs were very positive, and, as a result, the others are in production and will be completed in 1988. Only when a critical mass of curriculum is available can we really test our stated hypothesis. In the meantime, it is worthwhile to report the evaluation of the first two programs.\r"

Eighty-four patients had stab wounds, 22 had gunshot wounds, and two had shotgun wounds. The subxiphoid pericardial window procedure produced positive results in 30 patients (28%) and negative results in 78 patients (72%). There were two false-positive subxiphoid pericardial window procedures. Eleven patients (39%) with cardiac injuries were not hypotensive and did not have signs or symptoms of cardiac injuries prior to the subxiphoid pericardial window procedure. When they were obtained (n = 80), electrocardiograms were abnormal in 57% and 21% of patients with and without cardiac injuries, respectively. At thoracotomy, 28 patients had injuries (ventricle, 20; atrium, three; and pericardium, five) and 21 required suture repair. Thirty-nine patients underwent a concomitant laparotomy. Forty-six abdominal visceral injuries were identified in 28 patients, including 21 hollow viscus injuries. There was no significant short-term or long-term morbidity (eg, pericarditis, tamponade, or post-pericardiotomy syndrome) attributable to the subxiphoid pericardial window procedure. There were no known missed cardiac injuries, and there were no deaths in the series. Some patients with penetrating wounds to the heart have no overt signs or symptoms of cardiac injury. A subxiphoid pericardial window procedure quickly identifies or excludes cardiac injuries and can be performed with minimal morbidity, even when there is contamination from the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolic response to trauma and sepsis is characterized by a negative nitrogen balance, accelerated muscle proteolysis, increased ureagenesis, and stimulated acute-phase protein synthesis in liver. Inhibited uptake of amino acids and accelerated protein breakdown in muscle increase the flux of amino acids from the periphery to the liver. Concomitantly, hepatic uptake of amino acids is stimulated and protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis in the liver are enhanced. These events are important to the survival of patients with sepsis. Stimulated ureagenesis resulting in nitrogen loss from the body is another important aspect of hepatic nitrogen metabolism following trauma and sepsis. The mediator(s) initiating metabolic changes is not yet exactly defined, although regulatory protein(s) released from stimulated macrophages (particularly interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor) may play a major role in altered amino acid and protein metabolism in muscle and liver during sepsis. However, these factors alone are probably not responsible for the metabolic disturbances, since the catabolic hormones cortisol, glucagon, and the catecholamines can simulate the metabolic pattern observed in sepsis. Other possible mediators include prostaglandins and thyroid hormones. It is possible that the interaction between different types of mediators is necessary for the full manifestation of host responses to severe injury and sepsis.\r"

This issue was examined in a study of 39 patients with PD, utilizing standardized clinical measures, computerized neuropsychological tests, and quantitative computed tomography. Disorders of visuospatial discrimination and perceptual-motor function closely paralleled motor scores, suggesting a common neuropathologic basis. Caudate nuclear and mesocortical dopamine depletion play a role in this context. More generalized cognitive dysfunction occurred in older patients with a somewhat longer disease duration, more advanced parkinsonism, and computed tomographic evidence of subcortical and frontal cortical atrophy but without significant cerebral atrophy when compared with age-matched controls. Further prospective clinicopathologic studies will be required to clarify the relative contribution of the primary dopaminergic dysfunction, age-related changes, Alzheimer-type pathologic condition, and other coexisting neurotransmitter deficits to the dementia seen in PD.\r"

Reactivity with the cytoskeleton was expressed 3 times more frequently in the SLE-derived antibody group and included intermediate filaments, microfilaments, microtubules, and centrioles. By immunoblot analysis, the antigenic specificity of intermediate filament-reactive SLE hybridoma antibodies was not restricted to vimentin, but included cytokeratins and desmin. The antibodies were also studied for their DNA-binding, lupus anticoagulant, and rheumatoid factor activities. These autoantibody activities were expressed 3-5 times more frequently in the SLE-derived group. The ability to bind DNA was not a prerequisite for reactivity with intermediate filament proteins. Our findings suggest that there are at least 2 subsets of cytoskeletal-reactive hybridoma antibodies: those that recognize epitopes found only on cytoskeletal proteins, and those that recognize epitopes common to both DNA and certain cytoskeletal proteins. In addition, we hypothesize that there may be a third subset of antibodies that recognize a phosphate-containing moiety (phospholipid or phosphoprotein) associated with cytoskeletal filaments.\r"

Arrhythmia was uncommon in the patients with orthotopic transplants; none of them had more than one extrasystole per hour. In the patients with heterotopic cardiac transplants the recipient's own heart showed significantly more frequent ventricular arrhythmias than the corresponding donor heart: abnormal complexes (mean/24 h) 4583 vs 42.7; extrasystoles 1772 vs 17.8; pairs 121 vs 0.8. There was no relation between the abnormal ventricular activity of the two hearts in the patients with heterotopic transplants on a beat by beat, hourly, or 24 hour basis. There was no consistent diurnal variation in the frequency of the abnormal ventricular beats after cardiac transplantation. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia was unrelated to the interval from operation to the study. In long term survivors of cardiac transplantation the denervated heart shows a little ventricular ectopic activity even when compared with normal hearts. In patients with heterotopic transplants ventricular arrhythmias commonly occur in the recipient's own heart; these are probably related to the underlying severity of the original disease.\r"

Both drugs were equally effective in reducing the frequency of angina and in delaying the onset of ischaemia during exercise. Radionuclide ventriculography showed that atenolol but not celiprolol lowered cardiac output at rest and during exercise.

The effects of an incremental infusion of epoprostenol (prostacyclin) (0.5-8 ng/kg per minute) or sublingual nifedipine (20-30 mg) were compared with the response to three months' treatment with oral nifedipine. Both epoprostenol and sublingual nifedipine caused a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure and a rise in cardiac output. Patients with intracardiac shunts had higher systemic blood flows than those without shunts. Exercise in the shunt group was accompanied by systemic desaturation and hyperventilation. Analysis of individual results showed that the size of the response was inversely related to the severity of the pulmonary vascular disease. A good long term response to nifedipine seemed to be as readily predicted by the resting control values for haemodynamic variables as by values after short term treatment. A favourable response was likely if the pretreatment mean pulmonary artery pressure was less than 50 mm Hg, the ratio of total pulmonary to systemic resistance was less than 0.7, or the ratio of mean pulmonary artery pressure to systemic artery pressure was less than 0.6. Short term vasodilator protocols may do harm. If such studies are carried out, an adequate dose range must be tried before the long term efficacy of an individual drug can be forecast.\r"

Measurements were performed in a temperature controlled room at 28 degrees C. The blood flow in the patients was significantly lower than in the controls (P less than 0.001). After hand warming in water at 35 degrees C for 10 min, blood flow in the patients and controls did not differ significantly. Following this, the response to a standardized cold stress produced similar falls in both groups to levels that were not significantly different and these occurred over a similar time course. After cold stress ended, there was recovery of blood flow in both groups, and blood flow after 20 min was not significantly different between the two groups. The induced vasodilatation persisted, in those patients in whom it was remeasured, for at least 2 h. Repeating the experiments at a room temperature of 24 degrees C produced similar results. This indicates that considerable vasodilatation is possible in these patients, and can be produced by simple means. It also indicates that local and central thermoregulatory reflexes are intact. Cold induced symptoms in patients with SS are related to low resting blood flow, not to cold sensitivity, and simple warming may provide a useful treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The search for environmental factors associated with cataract has produced conflicting evidence and one possible reason may be that environmental influences are initiating events occurring perhaps for short periods many years before loss of sight from cataract. It is important, therefore, to be able to detect the earliest changes of cataract formation so that epidemiological studies have a better chance of detecting environmental factors. Two possible indicators of early cataract are delayed growth of the lens and abnormalities of the anterior subcapsular clear zone of the lens as observed on slit-lamp microscopy. A series of patients with early lens changes was compared with control subjects in respect to these two factors. Lens thickness was measured by a simple optical method. The mean thicknesses of the lens in patients with early cortical or posterior subcapsular lens changes were significantly less than that of age matched controls. 60% of lenses with early cataract of all types were found to have a deficient or absent anterior subcapsular clear zone. Lens thickness and the appearance of the anterior subcapsular clear zone are easy to measure and observe through an undilated pupil. Although the prognostic value of the results is uncertain in individual cases owing to the rather wide scatter of results in normal eyes, such observations could be of value in comparative studies of populations.\r"

The effect of such corrections was small, and there were close correlations between uncorrected and corrected acid outputs in all four groups. The status of the vagal efferent gastric fibres was assessed by comparing the acid output after insulin hypoglycaemia with the maximal acid output after pentagastrin (insulin: pentagastrin ratio). The application of the corrections did not alter the conclusion regarding the assessment of vagal status in 55 of the 56 studies performed. It is concluded that such corrections are not necessary in the routine performance of gastric secretory studies.\r"

Eighteen patients undergoing elective upper abdominal surgery of moderate severity were allocated to two groups: group G patients underwent operation under general anaesthesia, and postoperative pain was relieved by systemic administration of analgesia; and group E patients received epidural analgesia during surgery and epidural morphine postoperatively. In each patient the euglycaemic insulin clamp test was performed twice: several days before surgery and on postoperative day 1. Peroperative catecholamine and cortisol responses were also measured to investigate possible endocrine mechanisms of the insulin resistance. Glucose disposal (M) decreased in both groups on postoperative day 1 at plasma insulin concentrations ranging from 1.2 to 10.0 milliunits ml-1, resulting in the downward shift of dose-response curves. However, this downward shift was significantly smaller in group E than in group G patients. Urinary adrenaline excretion increased markedly on the day of operation in group G, but was significantly inhibited in group E. Urinary noradrenaline excretion increased mainly on postoperative day 1 in group G, but was significantly inhibited in group E. Plasma cortisol response was lower in group E than in group G during and shortly after operation, and was significantly inhibited in group E on postoperative day 1. These results indicate that insulin resistance after elective abdominal surgery is due to a postreceptor deficit in glucose utilization, as indicated by the downward shift of the dose-response curves. This disturbance in glucose metabolism was reduced by epidural analgesia, the results being associated with inhibited catecholamine and cortisol responses.\r"

The incidence of occult malignancy in substernal goitres was high (12 per cent). In the majority of patients (88 per cent) the substernal goitres were removed by a collar incision. Four cases of goitres located in a retrotracheal position required a combined cervical and sternotomy approach. None of the 34 patients died. Transient postoperative hypocalcaemia was found in 41 per cent of our patients. The presence of a substernal goitre is an indication for resection based on the risk of malignancy, the risk of acute respiratory distress, the high incidence of thyrotoxicity and a low surgical morbidity.\r"

It is proposed that the use of cyclosporin be restricted in the early post-transplant period until initial function of the transplant is established. The surgical procedure of kidney transplantation should be planned to minimize the anastomosis time prior to recirculation of the graft.\r"

However, most surgeons are reluctant to use steroids as the primary treatment for patients with this condition, mainly because of the risk of mismanagement of malignant retroperitoneal fibrosis. Our experience in the care of 17 patients with non-malignant retroperitoneal fibrosis has led us to believe that an initial non-surgical approach is both safe and preferable.\r"

Antibiotics were prescribed in 763 (64%) episodes and broad spectrum antibiotics in 161 (21%) of these. If there was dysphagia, hoarseness, cervical adenopathy, and inflamed or purulent tonsils a prescription was more likely to be written. An enzyme immunoassay rapid test was evaluated as a means of rationalizing prescribing. Among 23 general practitioners and 250 patients the sensitivity of the test was 63% and the specificity 91.7% compared with 74% and 58% for clinical assessment alone. Test results rarely caused previous prescribing decisions (34 [corrected] (13%) episodes) to be altered. We suggest that the time is not ripe for the use of the enzyme immunoassay rapid test on a wide scale in the routine assessment of sore throats.\r"

In addition, dexamethasone induced an apparent luminal structure in the tissue section of the tumor and enhanced the immunoperoxidase reaction to epithelial membrane antigen. The results indicate that dexamethasone inhibited the proliferation of HSG cells in the nude mouse transplantation system probably by inducing the cellular differentiation of the HSG cells toward the more differentiated ductal epithelia via glucocorticoid receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The proliferative potential of 17 intracranial and spinal tumors (six craniopharyngiomas, four chordomas, three mature teratomas, one immature teratoma, one embryonal carcinoma, one choriocarcinoma, and one dermoid tumor) was assessed. The patients received a 30-minute to 60-minute infusion of bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) (200 mg/m2 intravenously [IV]) at the time of surgery but before a biopsy of the tumor was performed, to label cells in the DNA synthesis phase. The labeling index (LI) was calculated by determining the percentage of BUdR-labeled cells. The mean LI of the squamous epithelial elements of mature teratomas, craniopharyngiomas, and the dermoid tumor were 3.1 +/- 1.2%, 1.9 +/- 0.9%, and 2.9 +/- 1.9%, respectively. As in normal epithelium, the labeled cells were located in the basal layer. These results and the clinical findings suggest that the proliferation kinetics of these tumors are similar to those of normal skin and differ from those of rapidly growing malignant neoplasms. The other tissue elements (i.e., respiratory epithelium and cartilage) also demonstrated \"organized\" proliferation patterns similar to those of the corresponding normal tissues. An immature teratoma, an embryonal carcinoma, and a choriocarcinoma each had a high LI (24.6 +/- 5.3%, 32.3 +/- 3.8%, and 17.0 +/- 4.6%, respectively), and no organized pattern of proliferation was observed. In contrast, the mean LI of the four chordomas varied from 1.5% to 5.8%, and there was an even larger variation in the LI of different areas in individual tumors (from less than 1% to 7.5%). This finding suggests that even \"slow-growing\" chordomas sometimes can be locally aggressive and show a high incidence of recurrence, regardless of morphologic similarities.\r"

  ".W": "The use of histocompatability antigen (HLA)-matched platelets has been advocated for the support of thrombocytopenic cancer patients. We randomized 78 newly diagnosed cancer patients prospectively (before thrombocytopenia) to receive either HLA-matched or mismatched single-donor platelet transfusions. Three hundred forty-one platelet transfusions were given for 80 separate episodes of therapy-induced thrombocytopenia in 33 patients. Forty-five patients receiving intensive chemotherapy did not develop significant (less than 20,000 platelets/mm3) thrombocytopenia and did not receive a platelet transfusion. No marked difference was observed between the matched and mismatched groups in regard to number of total platelet transfusions per patient (median, 3 vs. 5, respectively; P = 0.076), number of platelet transfusions per episode (median, 3.0 vs. 3.5, respectively; P = 0.28), or days between transfusions (median, 2 vs. 2, respectively, P greater than 0.4). Bleeding episodes, although rare, tended to be of increased severity in the mismatched group. Febrile patients receiving mismatched platelets tended to have a lower posttransfusion increment increase than their nonfebrile counterparts (P = 0.068), although a similar trend could not be demonstrated between febrile and nonfebrile patients who received matched platelets (P = 0.22). Patients treated as outpatients had significantly higher posttransfusion increments than when transfused as inpatients when they were given mismatched platelets (P less than 0.0005). Development of antiplatelet antibody did not appear to affect response to platelet transfusions. Only one patient developed sustained high-level antibody titers. In patients where thrombocytopenia was significant, the transfusion of HLA-matched platelets did not appear to offer a significant advantage. However, HLA-matched platelet transfusions tended to be associated with higher posttransfusion increments in febrile patients and a trend toward fewer severe bleeding episodes. A multi-institution trial containing a large number of patients is needed to evaluate trends observed in this study.\r"

The results were as follows: 15 CR after two injections of CP, 30 CR after three, and 5 CR after the fourth administration. Three of 53 cases could not be evaluated because of early death. Of the 30 clearly haemorragic effusions, 25 turned into serofibrinosis after the first intrapleural injection of CP and the other five after the second. These findings indicate that intracavitary CP is the most adequate treatment for the control of neoplastic pleural effusion because it induces a significant clinical improvement with milder side effects with respect to other drugs and/or physical agents commonly used.\r"

Implications for management and therapy of Stage IVS neuroblastoma are discussed with reference to this case and the recent literature.\r"

Four of the 80 children had exposure to known risk factors (two had history of exposure to asbestos, one had received radiation therapy, and one had been exposed in utero to isoniazid). Tissue slides were available for independent and joint review by a panel of three pathologists in 22 of the cases. Ten were accepted as MM, nine were reclassified as other malignancies, and three were considered tumors of uncertain nature. Six of the ten children with MM were boys, and four were girls. Eight had pleural tumors, and two had peritoneal tumors. Four died at 7, 8, 18, and 48 months after diagnosis; three remained alive at 19, 20, and 59 months; and three had no follow-up. This review suggests that MM of childhood is a valid entity with a grave prognosis. The tissue diagnosis is difficult and is best made by a panel of pathologists. The available evidence does not support a causal relationship between MM and asbestos, radiation, or isoniazid.\r"

Hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigenemia was detected in 21 patients (17.2%) and this was significantly higher than the prevalence of HBsAg carrier in the general population (p less than 0.01). These patients had no clinical or laboratory findings to suggest acute or chronic liver diseases. Two glomerulopathic entities: mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with predominant mesangial IgA deposits and a mixed picture of membranous nephropathy with capillary IgG deposits and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with mesangial IgA deposits, were observed in this group of patients. Glomerular deposits of HBsAg, hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), and both HBsAg and HBcAg were detected in three, five and four renal biopsy specimens respectively. Replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was suggested in two of the six renal biopsy specimens examined by HBV DNA gene probe. During the mean study period of 40 months (range 12-84), 19% of these patients with hepatitis B virus-associated IgA nephropathy developed progressive renal deterioration and one required maintenance dialysis therapy. Our study suggests that hepatitis B virus antigenemia may play a significant pathogenetic role in the development of IgA nephropathy in areas of high HBV endemicity and these HBV-associated IgA nephropathies can run an indolent but relentless slowly progressive clinical course.\r"

  ".W": "Determination of serum and urinary neopterin levels was performed daily in 30 patients undergoing kidney transplantation for treatment of end-stage renal failure. Neopterin serum levels were determined by RIA and urinary excretion by HPLC. In parallel, the same samples were tested for creatinine content. Results indicated a strong correlation between the clearance of neopterin and creatinine. This correlation was independent of the extent of functional impairment as well as of the different causes of renal insufficiency. As a consequence, a strong relationship between serum and urinary neopterin levels was only obtained when values were corrected for different renal function by dividing them by the creatinine levels. It thus appears that major attention has to be paid to the functional state of the kidney when studying neopterin serum and/or urine values. It also appears that under these prerequisites both methods of detection as well as both sample sources yield comparable results.\r"

These patients were receiving desferrioxamine (DFO) for aluminum overload and had no iron-overload. Ten similar patients, all (with only one possible exception) receiving DFO, have been reported from American centers. The mechanism by which DFO could precipitate mucormycosis is unsettled. The explanation might be that DFO acts as a siderophore to the Mucorales fungi. High serum levels of DFO in renal failure could enhance this mechanism. Epidemiological data, provided from an inquiry in 25 Flemish dialysis centers, support the association between DFO treatment and dialysis-associated mucormycosis.\r"

Effective drugs led to more efficient and humane treatment of patients with such disorders. Still, our present drugs leave much to be desired. As we have learned more about how they may ameliorate various types of mental disorders, we generate hypotheses about the possible causes of the disorders we treat. Thus we try to lift ourselves by our bootstraps; drugs generate hypotheses that one hopes will lead to better drugs. Although at times progress seems to be agonizingly slow, if we consider the great progress of the past 35 years one cannot be less than enthusiastic about the prospects for the next three decades. It has been my good fortune to have been connected closely with the developments of the past, a few of which have been discussed in this personal odyssey. It will be the good fortune of my younger colleagues to see the future realization of many of our hopes for better treatment and understanding of psychiatric disorders.\r"

The bolus dose of tyramine needed was 4.34 +/- 1.51 mg (X +/- SD) and the infusion rate needed was 1.11 +/- 0.33 mg/min. Four blood pressure response patterns to continuous tyramine infusion were observed. Because different units were measured for the quantity of tyramine administered, the between-subject variance estimate to within-subject variance estimate ratios were calculated. The two techniques had equivalent consistency. With the bolus method, in contrast to the infusion procedure, the dose-response relationship was obvious in most subjects. Therefore the bolus method was judged to be more useful than the infusion method.\r"

Acyclovir plasma concentrations were measured by RIA on posttransplant days 1 or 2 and 5, 6, or 7. Mean peak and trough concentrations on days 5, 6 or 7 were 25 and 18 mumol/L, respectively. The pharmacokinetic model predicted acyclovir concentrations with a precision of 4.1 mumol/L and bias of -1.19 mumol/L. Estimates of individual pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with literature and a priori values. Two of six adverse events were attributable to acyclovir; both resolved with dose modification. The dosage adjustment scheme and pharmacokinetic model performed well, allowing us to safely administer high-dose oral acyclovir immediately after renal transplantation. We are proceeding with a placebo-controlled study to assess efficacy for suppression of posttransplant cytomegalovirus disease.\r"

Proteinuria, albuminuria, and amino aciduria, together with an increase of beta 2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) excretion rates, were observed during each treatment cycle. A good correlation was registered between the increase in urinary excretion rates of protein, NAG, and magnesium and the decrease in proximal tubular salt and water reabsorption during cisplatin administration.\r"

The BP and HR parameters were evaluated at rest (casual, 24 hours after administration), during treadmill exercise testing (Bruce protocol), and with 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring. These assessments were made after a 4-week drug washout period and after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy. After 8 weeks of therapy with cilazapril (mean dose 3.6 +/- 0.9 mg/day), casual BP decreased 19/11 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), whereas placebo lowered BP by 4/5 mm Hg (difference not significant) compared with the baseline period. The casual HR was modestly (7 beats/min) but significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered by cilazapril monotherapy. Exercise BP was reduced by cilazapril (reduction at peak HR, 23/11 +/- 10/5 mm Hg; p less than 0.05), and exercise HR was unchanged. Compared with baseline, the duration of exercise was improved with cilazapril but not with placebo (1.0 minute vs -0.2 minute; p less than 0.05). Twenty-four-hour mean, awake, and sleep BPs were reduced with cilazapril with the most impressive reduction occurring during the awake period (19/12 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that cilazapril lowers casual, exercise, and ambulatory BP with a modest but significant improvement in exercise time. Thus cilazapril may be particularly effective in the physically active hypertensive patient.\r"

Sixty-nine percent of patients responded when carprofen concentrations were greater than 10 micrograms/ml, whereas only 9% responded when they were below 1.9 micrograms/ml.

Antihypertensive medications that reduce blood pressure and improve peripheral perfusion would have advantages in diabetic patients with hypertension. In a randomized, two-placebo period, single-blind, two-way crossover study, we determined finger and forearm blood flow, lipid levels, and blood pressure control in 19 diabetic patients with hypertension, with each atenolol or prazosin and placebo period of 4 weeks' duration. Both drugs reduced blood pressure (sitting: 157/95 to 142/84 mm Hg, atenolol; 155/95 to 138/82 mm Hg, prazosin; standing: 154/94 to 144/84 mm Hg, atenolol; 154/94 to 133/81 mm Hg, prazosin). Lipid levels did not change except that low-density lipoprotein levels fell from 148 to 127 mg/dl with prazosin. Atenolol did not change forearm or finger blood flow or vascular resistance. Prazosin increased blood flow and reduced vascular resistance in both finger and forearm. In conclusion, prazosin has a potentially more appropriate hemodynamic profile than has atenolol in diabetic patients with hypertension.\r"

In 10 patients the drug was administered intravenously for 6 hours daily for 6 days at a rate of 1 ng/kg/min. In 7 patients iloprost was also administered at a dose of 2 ng/kg/min for the same time. There was no significant change in heart rate and blood pressure at both iloprost doses. At the dose of 1 ng/kg/min the drug had no effect on renal hemodynamics and function, PRA, and PA. At the dose of 2 ng/kg/min iloprost significantly increased RPF (p less than 0.025) and FENa (p less than 0.025) and significantly decreased HFRNa (p less than 0.025) without affecting glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, urine flow, PFRNa, PRA, and PA. No correlation was found between the increase in RPF and FENa (r = 0.01). We conclude that at a dose of 2 ng/kg/min, but not 1 ng/kg/min, iloprost has a natriuretic effect secondary to inhibition of sodium reabsorption at the ascending limb of the Henle's loop and not related to the renal hemodynamic effect.\r"

Flurbiprofen was buccally absorbed by a passive diffusional mechanism and the rate of absorption was pH dependent. Membrane permeability coefficients for flurbiprofen were 4.3 x 10(-4) cm/sec at pH 5.5 and 2.1 x 10(-5) cm/sec at pH 7.0. These findings are in agreement with the pH relationship for buccal transport observed in dog experiments. Delineation of the effective permeability coefficients into components for the aqueous boundary layer and the lipoidal buccal membrane allowed for the prediction of the extent of absorption of the drug over a period of time. It was concluded that the buccal membranes of the human and dog were essentially lipoidal membranes with equivalent permeabilities and no evident aqueous pore pathways.\r"

In 9 patients with cystic fibrosis receiving a short (1 minute) infusion of ceftazidime pharmacokinetic parameter values were determined with a nonlinear least-squares estimator analyzing a traditional, geometrically spaced set of 12 postinfusion serum samples drawn over 8 hours. These values were compared with values generated from four sample subsets of the 12 obtained at optimal times and analyzed by nonlinear least-squares estimator, as well as a maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian estimator with prior distributions placed on beta and clearance. The four sampling times were determined according to an adaptive design optimization technique that employs sequential updating of population prior distributions on parameter values. Compared with the 12-point determination, the four optimal points analyzed with the maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian estimator faithfully reproduced both microscopic and hybrid pharmacokinetic parameter values for individual patients and, consequently, also produced accurate measures of population central tendency and dispersion. This has important implications in being able to more efficiently derive target patient population pharmacokinetic information for new drugs. This should also allow generation of better concentration-effect relationships in populations of interest.\r"

Some bronchiectatic patients persistently expectorate purulent secretions containing many polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) and bacteria, suggesting ineffective microbial clearing from the lung. We have therefore studied several aspects of PMN recruitment to the lung by chemotaxis. 2. Circulating PMN from patients with bronchiectasis show a variable chemotactic response to the synthetic peptide N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine. This is similar to the response of PMN from healthy controls and suggests that failure to clear microbial organisms is not due to defective chemotaxis as measured here. 3. Purulent sputum solphase demonstrates chemotactic activity against control PMN. This activity is greater (P less than 0.001) than that found with mucoid sputum solphase, which is consistent with the neutrophil content of the secretions in vivo. 4. Successful antibiotic therapy reduces the chemotactic activity of purulent sputum solphase from a median value of 183 (range 28-201) cells/high power field to 33.5 (range 0.7-64) cells/high power field (P less than 0.0025).

Sixty-four subjects were pair-matched for sex, age, weight and sitting systolic blood pressure, and were randomly allocated to receive one of two types of protein supplement: one containing proteins from meat, the other proteins from non-meat sources. The supplements were balanced in terms of other nutrients. Consumption of other meat, poultry or fish was prohibited. 3. Sitting and standing blood pressures, weight, dietary intakes and plasma and urinary electrolytes were measured at regular intervals during the 12 weeks of trial. Urinary 3-methylhistidine was used as a measure of compliance. 4. Fifty subjects completed the trial. There were no statistically significant blood pressure differences between groups either at baseline or at end-of-trial, neither were there any substantive differences in mean blood pressure changes between baseline and end-of-trial. 3-Methyl-histidine excretion was significantly lower in subjects on the non-meat diet. 5. The results suggest that the protein components of the lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet are not responsible for the blood-pressure-lowering effects of that diet.\r"

  ".W": "We report on the effect of the excised and grafted chest and abdominal burn on lung function. Six consecutive patients with 3 degree burns to the entire chest and abdomen (72 +/- 10% total body surface area 3 degree burns) were studied. A severe restrictive lung dysfunction due to the noncompliant nature of the excised and grafted chest and abdominal wound was identified; this was most evident when inspiratory pressure (IP) was even modestly impaired with general anesthetics. Measured vital capacity (VC) was 12 to 14 ml/kg at 6 to 8 wk postburn, in the absence of any significant parenchymal injury. The measured VC was identical to the tidal volume (VT) used during the extended period of mechanical ventilatory support. Dynamic compliance (or characteristic) (Cdyn) decreased dramatically from 35 +/- 8 to 15 +/- 9 ml/cm H2O when the positive pressure VT was increased by as little as 100 ml above prior VT settings, indicating the noncompliant nature of the combined chest and abdominal excised and grafted burn. Major cardiopulmonary complications developed in the first two patients after onset of the restrictive process when general anesthesia was used for grafting procedures (n = 8) and the limits of chest wall excursion were unrecognized. Patients received only continuous positive airway pressure preoperatively. A modest but significant decrease in IP from -45 +/- 8 to -33 +/- 5 cm H2O and 30% decrease in spontaneous VT were noted in the early postoperative period. These changes, however, resulted in a dramatic decrease in pulmonary function leading to hypercarbia, PCO2 greater than 50 torr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood gas and expired CO2 tensions, pulmonary mechanics, and hemodynamics were measured during each pattern. Flow pattern sequence was randomized and MIC was repeated at 30 to 45-min intervals. MIC reliably reduced PaO2, and increased PaCO2 and peak tracheal pressure (PT). There was no significant difference in gas exchange or hemodynamics between various VI curves. Insufflation with an accelerated VI manifested a significantly higher PT than any other pattern. We conclude that no VI contour studied offers a unique advantage for gas exchange after MIC in swine. However, since accelerated gas flow generates significantly higher PT values, it is not recommended in the presence of significant airway resistance.\r"

The physician with the ultrasound stethoscope detected structural valvular problems (eg, stenosis) in 70 percent of cases but only detected flow abnormalities (eg, regurgitation) in 14 percent of cases. We conclude that (1) an experienced echocardiographer using an ultrasound stethoscope can detect most structural abnormalities found by a standard echocardiographic instrument; (2) chamber size, valvular stenosis, and pericardial effusions were accurately assessed; (3) the ultrasound stethoscope cannot be used to detect valvular regurgitation; and (4) limitations include the lack of freeze-frame, M-mode, hard copy, and Doppler.\r"

Twenty methacholine reactors had more severe lung disease (lower S-K clinical scores and more impairment of pulmonary function) than did 16 nonreactive patients, and acute bronchodilator response was greater in the methacholine reactors. Thirty-four patients were followed prospectively over a 17- to 24-month period. Among 19 methacholine reactors, there were more pulmonary exacerbations and a more rapid decline in FEV1. In general, increased obstruction was associated with increased reactivity. Although the data are subject to differing interpretations, they are consistent with the hypothesis that in patients with CF, airway hyperreactivity occurs secondary to bronchial damage, age, is associated with more rapid pulmonary deterioration, and is an unfavorable prognostic finding.\r"

The therapeutic range of aminoglycosides is narrow due to oto- and nephrotoxicity. The changed pharmacokinetics and the narrow therapeutic range make it difficult to ensure that patients with CF are adequately and safely treated with aminoglycosides. The mode of administration of aminoglycosides influences the antibacterial effect of these agents on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the development of possible side effects. The therapeutic implications of these facts are discussed.\r"

For in situ hybridization, a biotin-labeled probe of total genomic DNA of H influenzae type b was prepared that hybridizes specifically with H influenzae, H parainfluenzae, H hemolyticus, and H parahemolyticus DNA. Immunoperoxidase staining was done with monoclonal antibody 8BD9 directed against outer membrane protein P6 of H influenzae. Both techniques detected Hemophilus in sputum equally well and were superior to culture: all 30 sputum samples culture-positive for H influenzae were positive on both nonculture tests, and 13 additional positive sputum samples were detected from which Hemophilus was not cultured. The higher sensitivity of the nonculture tests was mainly attributed to culture failure because of overgrowth of H influenzae by other bacteria, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis. The immunoperoxidase staining technique appeared slightly easier and quicker to perform than the in situ hybridization test. For the in situ DNA hybridization probe, DNA can be prepared from any strain of H influenzae. The immunoperoxidase test requires monoclonal antibody 8BD9 but has a higher specificity than the hybridization technique. Both techniques can be reliably applied, especially for the detection of Hemophilus in sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

Multiple mechanisms contribute to stress ulcer formation, the most important of which appear to be mucosal ischemia and the inability to control back-diffused hydrogen. Antacids and histamine2-blocking agents are presently the cornerstone of effective prophylaxis, but because they have been implicated as contributors to nosocomial pneumonias due to bacterial overgrowth in the stomach, investigation is ongoing into such alternative prophylactic agents as sucralfate and prostaglandins that do not alter the normal gastric acidity.

The signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome are hyperpyrexia, defined by body temperature greater than 38 degrees C; extreme muscle rigidity, with or without elevated creatine phosphokinase or hyperreflexia; and other symptoms such as altered level of consciousness and/or autonomic dysfunction as manifested by labile blood pressure, tachycardia, tachypnea, urinary or fecal incontinence, pallor, or diaphoresis. This potentially fatal syndrome complicates the treatment of patients with recurrent psychotic symptoms because of the possibility for recurrence of the NMS. A case of recurrent NMS is presented in which the patient was rechallenged with an antipsychotic agent. In addition, 41 reported cases of antipsychotic rechallenge after NMS are reviewed. The results of the review suggest that neuroleptic rechallenge following NMS is associated with an acceptable risk of recurrence in most patients. However, close monitoring for NMS and careful selection of patients for antipsychotic rechallenge is mandatory. A minimal time period of five days before rechallenge may also reduce the risk of recurrent NMS. Recurrence was not associated with patient age or gender, nor the antipsychotic agent used.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past several years there has been a growing interest in the use of locally implanted beads containing antibiotics for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. This method has been popularized in Europe and, with few exceptions, gentamicin has been the only antibiotic used. There have been only a few reports from the U.S. and there is little information regarding the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics used in this fashion. To our knowledge this is the first report using vancomycin. Three patients with chronic osteomyelitis were treated with vancomycin and/or tobramycin polymethylmethacrylate beads. These beads were extemporaneously compounded and implanted for up to six weeks. From the site of bead implantation local fluid aliquots were collected for the measurement of antibiotic concentrations. In two patients, initial tobramycin concentrations exceeded 400 mg/L. In one patient receiving vancomycin, initial localized concentrations were approximately 100 mg/L. In all three patients therapeutic concentrations of localized antibiotic were maintained with immeasurable systemic concentrations throughout the period of bead placement. Localized antibiotic therapy for the management of chronic osteomyelitis represents a potential therapeutic alternative to long-term parenteral therapy. Data presented here suggest that other antibiotics, such as vancomycin and tobramycin, can be used successfully in polymethylmethacrylate beads and provide preliminary facts for future investigations of such applications.\r"

Hypoestrogenic-associated conditions can be managed by a variety of medical regimens and lifestyle changes, but estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is the most specific and universal treatment for all of the above conditions. Although concern for potential risks has limited its acceptance, the benefits of ERT extend beyond the amelioration of estrogen deprivation symptoms. Evidence is accumulating that ERT may offer protection from cardiovascular atherogenic disease. Several of the risks that have been associated with continuous ERT, such as endometrial cancer and breast cancer, are significantly reduced with the use of cyclic progestogens. Moreover, any concern arising from the use of conjugated estrogens and synthetic progestogens are being addressed by the recent introduction of orally active natural estrogen and soon, progesterone. With the demonstrated efficacy and safety of ERT, such therapy should be considered for all postmenopausal women.\r"

  ".W": "We recently described a preferential reduction of the secretory response to nutrient secretagogues (glucose; leucine plus glutamine) in islets maintained in culture after in vitro exposure to streptozotocin (SZ). The present study is an attempt to further clarify the biochemical mechanisms behind this defective insulin response. Mouse pancreatic islets were collagenase isolated and, after 4-5 days in culture, exposed during 30 min at 37 C to 1.8 mM SZ or vehicle alone (controls). The islets were subsequently cultured for 7 days in medium RPMI 1640 plus 10% calf serum, before the enzymatic and metabolic studies were performed. The activities of the glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, glucokinase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, were similar in the control and SZ-exposed islets. The relative amount of cytosolic and mitochondria-bound hexokinase was also unaffected by SZ. However, there was a 30-40% decrease in the activity of NAD+- and NADP+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate-aspartate transaminase in the SZ-treated islets. This coincided with a 40% decrease in L-[U-14C]glutamine oxidation in the SZ-treated islets. The D-glucose catabolism was further examined in the presence of D-[5-3H] and D-[6-14C] glucose. There was no difference between control and SZ islets in terms of glucose utilization at either 1.7 or 16.7 mM glucose. The oxidation of D-[6-14C]glucose was nevertheless decreased by more than 50% in SZ islets incubated at 16.7 mM (but not 1.7 mM) glucose. Altogether, these converging observations suggest a perturbation of distal regulatory processes, apparently at the mitochondrial level, in the D-glucose and L-glutamine catabolism of SZ-exposed islets. Whether this reflects a primary action of SZ on the islet mitochondria, or an inhibitory effect of SZ on the synthesis of mitochondrial enzymes, as a result of nuclear DNA damage, remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "The pancreatic beta-cell is differentiated to express the insulin biosynthetic secretory pathway and to regulate this pathway principally by sensing the extracellular glucose concentration. With aging, glucose stimulation of both insulin synthesis and secretion is significantly impaired. The mechanism of the 40-50% decrease in the short term stimulation of insulin synthesis by glucose in rat pancreatic islets was studied in an effort to elucidate the specific stage at which the impairment occurs. In isolated islets from both young (4- to 5-month-old) and old (18- to 28-month-old) rats at normal (5.5 mM) and elevated (11 mM) glucose concentrations, insulin I was the predominant mature insulin species that accumulated during a 4-h labeling period. After preincubation of islets for 16 h in Minimum Essential Medium (with 5.5 mM glucose), total preproinsulin mRNA levels were similar in old and young islets; after preincubation in an enriched medium, RPMI-1640 (with 11 mM glucose), old and young levels were still similar, although preproinsulin mRNA levels were 6-fold higher. Proinsulin synthesis during a 30-min pulse label period was stimulated 10-fold in young islets and 7-fold in old islets at 16.7 mM glucose compared with synthesis at 2.8 mM glucose and was not affected by 5 micrograms/ml actinomycin-D. Furthermore, stimulation of the two major known intracellular second messenger systems in beta-cells, the cAMP system and the protein kinase-C system, with 8-bromo-cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, or a phorbol ester did not further increase proinsulin synthesis over a 30-min pulse label period in islets already stimulated by 16.7 mM glucose. Thus, the impairments in the short term effects of glucose on proinsulin synthesis in old islets are posttranscription of preproinsulin mRNA and likely to lie at the level of enhancement of translation of preexisting preproinsulin mRNA by factors activated or inhibited by the ambient glucose concentration. These age-impaired factors are not modulated through the cAMP or protein kinase-C system.\r"

  ".W": "The description of the cellular localization of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) remains incomplete, as do the descriptions of changes in their characteristics with respect to different developmental stages. We, therefore, performed affinity labeling studies in microsomal membrane preparations of adult and fetal rat brain and liver tissues with [125I]IGF-I and [125I]IGF-II. These studies demonstrated tissue- and developmental stage-specific structural variants of type I receptor alpha-subunits as well as type II receptors. The adult rat brain type I alpha-subunit had an apparent mol wt (Mr) of 127,000, whereas those of adult and fetal rat liver measured 140,000. Fetal rat brain microsomes, however, had two types of type I receptor alpha-subunits measuring 130,000 and 120,000 Mr. The larger subunit from fetal brain consistently migrated at an apparent Mr of 3,000, greater than subunits from adult brain. Both type I and II receptors were more abundant in fetal liver and brain than in adult tissues. Affinity labeling was also performed directly to monolayers of cultured fetal brain neurons and newborn astrocytes. These studies detected both type I and II receptors on the surfaces of both types of cells. However, only the high Mr (140,000) form of the type I alpha-subunit was detected in cultured CNS cells, suggesting that expression of low Mr variant receptors is altered in vitro. Type II receptors were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in adult rat hypothalamic neurons. However, the majority of neurons did not react with type II receptor antibody. This finding implies that only a minority of hypothalamic neurons are capable of responding to IGF-II via type II receptors. On the other hand, all astrocytes had striking type II receptor immunoreactivity. This signifies a more general biological role for this receptor in astrocytes compared with neurons. These results suggest that different tissue-, developmental stage-, and cell-specific processes are mediated by IGF receptors and suggests new directions in which to explore potential biological actions for these receptor-ligand systems in the CNS.\r"

We examined the effect of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and [D-Ala6,Des-Gly10]GnRH ethylamide (GnRHa) on inositol phospholipid metabolism in day 2 and day 7 corpora lutea from PMSG-treated rats. Isolated corpora lutea were incubated with 32PO4 or [3H]inositol and were treated with LH, PGF2 alpha, or GnRHa. Phospholipids were purified by TLC, and the water-soluble products of phospholipase-C activity (inositol phosphates) were isolated by ion exchange chromatography. In day 2 corpora lutea, PGF2 alpha, (10 microM) and GnRHa (100 ng/ml) significantly increased 32PO4 incorporation into phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), but not into other fractions. LH provoked slight increases in PA. Results were similar with 30 min of prelabeling or simultaneous addition of 32PO4 and stimulants. In other experiments, PGF2 alpha and GnRHa provoked rapid increases (1-5 min) in the accumulation of inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates. LH did not significantly increase inositol phosphate accumulation, but stimulated cAMP accumulation in 2-day-old corpora lutea. Inositol phospholipid metabolism was increased in day 7 corpora lutea compared to that in day 2 corpora lutea. This increase was associated with increased incorporation of 32PO4 into PA and PI and increased accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates. In day 7 corpora lutea, which are very sensitive to the luteolytic effect of PGF2 alpha, the PG-induced increase in PA labeling was small and inconsistent, whereas PI labeling was unaffected in 30-min incubations. GnRHa was without effect in such corpora lutea. LH, PGF2 alpha, or GnRHa did not increase inositol phosphate accumulation in 7-day-old corpora lutea. These studies demonstrate that the transformation of young (day 2) to mature (day 7) corpora lutea is associated with an increase in luteal inositol phospholipid metabolism. The results also show that PGF2 alpha and GnRHa stimulate phospholipase-C activity in young corpora lutea, but are ineffective in mature corpora lutea, and suggest that an increase in inositol phospholipid metabolism by itself is not sufficient to explain the acute luteolytic action of PGF2 alpha and GnRH in vitro. However, phospholipase-C-derived second messengers may be involved in the action of hormones that control luteal function.\r"

  ".U": "88283512\r", 
  ".W": "GH is believed to play a role in promoting insulin resistance in patients with diabetes and with GH excess. The means by which GH produces insulin resistance may be through direct suppression of glucose metabolism in target cells (insulin-independent) or by interfering with the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose metabolism (insulin-dependent). In 3T3-F442A adipocytes, long term incubation (24-72 h) with GH directly inhibits glucose oxidation and lipid synthesis in the absence of insulin. To distinguish the insulin-independent effects of GH on glucose metabolism from the insulin-dependent effects of GH, we examined the effect of GH on insulin-stimulated lipid accumulation in cultured 3T3-F442A adipocytes. Cells were incubated for 48-72 h with GH and then treated with insulin. Insulin stimulated lipid accumulation in GH-pretreated and control cells. Compared to control, GH-treated cells had lower absolute levels of lipid accumulation in the absence of insulin and at each insulin concentration tested. Thus, GH directly suppresses basal lipid accumulation and lowers the response to insulin. In addition, a 10 times higher insulin concentration was required to reach maximum stimulation of lipid accumulation in GH-treated cells (50 ng/ml) than in control cells (5 ng/ml). When cells were exposed simultaneously to insulin and GH for 72 h, GH treatment inhibited the ability of insulin to stimulate lipid accumulation, and the degree of suppression by GH was related to the GH concentration present. These observations suggest that GH suppresses glucose metabolism not only in the absence but also in the presence of insulin. Since short term (4-h) incubation with GH increases glucose metabolism transiently in GH-deficient preparations, we also examined the influence of short term incubation with GH on insulin responses. Cells were incubated for 4 h with varying concentrations of insulin in the simultaneous presence or absence of GH. Insulin stimulated the conversion of glucose to lipid when tested alone or in the presence of GH. Short term exposure to GH alone also stimulated glucose metabolism. The stimulation of lipid accumulation at insulin concentrations less than 5 ng/ml was greater with GH, but responses were comparable above 5 ng/ml insulin. The ability of insulin to bind to its receptor was not affected by prior treatment with GH for either short or prolonged time periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to examine short photoperiod (SD; 8 h of light, 16 h of darkness)-induced alterations in reproductive endocrine and neuroendocrine parameters in the male white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. Exposure to SD for 8 weeks caused dramatic reductions in testis and seminal vesicle weights, decreased circulating LH and testosterone levels, and lowered the content of LH in the pituitary gland relative to those in mice under long photoperiod (LD; 16 h of light, 8 h of darkness). These changes were associated with significant increases in content of radioimmunoassayable GnRH in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and anterior hypothalamus at two time points in the light/dark cycle: 2100 h (dark phase) and 0900 h (light phase), respectively. Exposure to SD also caused an increase in radioimmunoassayable beta-endorphin in the MBH and preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA) at 2100 h, but not at 0900 h. Mice exposed to SD also had a significantly higher metabolism of serotonin in the MBH at 0900 and 2100 h compared to mice under LD. The concentration of noradrenaline in the hypothalamus was unaffected by exposure to SD. However, the metabolism of dopamine (DA) in the POA at 0900 h was significantly increased relative to that in mice maintained under LD at this time. This increase in DA metabolism was associated with enhanced immunocytochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase in nerve fibers of the POA. Conversely, staining for tyrosine hydroxylase in tuberoinfundibular DA cell bodies of the arcuate nucleus was less intense under SD exposure. From these data it is concluded that exposure to SD caused regional and time-dependent alterations in the activities of hypothalamic amines (serotonin and DA) and neuropeptides (beta-endorphin and GnRH). These changes may be part of the neuroendocrine mechanism for SD-induced seasonal adaptations.\r"

  ".W": "Pituitary cells were cultured as three-dimensional reaggregates in serum-free chemically defined medium supplemented with different concentrations of dexamethasone. Immunostaining of the cells using a polyclonal antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies raised against choline acetyl transferase (CAT), revealed the presence of CAT immunoreactivity in 4-10% of anterior pituitary cells depending on the antibody used. CAT immunoreactivity was also found in freshly dispersed anterior pituitary cells. CAT-immunoreactive cells could be enriched on BSA and Percoll gradients and codistributed with ACTH-immunoreactive cells in these gradients. Perifusion of the aggregates with the potent muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (Atr) resulted in a dose-dependent (0.1-100 nM) increase in both basal PRL and GH secretion; the response was dependent on the dexamethasone concentration in the culture medium. A similar response to Atr was observed in organ-cultured pituitaries. The specificity of the Atr effect was supported by the findings that the potent and highly specific muscarinic receptor blocker dexetimide showed a similar action, whereas its inactive enantiomer levetimide and the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium failed to do so. Two other muscarinic antagonists, benzatropine and pirenzepine, showed a dose-dependent hormone-releasing action similar to that of Atr, but were less potent than the latter. Pirenzepine was only effective at high molar concentrations, suggesting that an M2 muscarinic receptor subtype was mediating the present phenomenon. Atr also potentiated GH release stimulated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and PRL release stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, but had no effect on GRF-stimulated GH release. The choline uptake blocker hemicholinium abolished the effect of Atr on GH and PRL release. These data suggest that certain pituitary cells can express CAT activity and that these cells exert a tonic inhibitory activity on GH and PRL release which is mediated by a cholinomimetic substance, possibly acetylcholine, through a muscarinic receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of the microsomal (M) antigen on the surface and in the cytoplasm of a strain of rat thyroid cells (FRTL-5) is under the regulation of TSH. In the present report the mechanism by which TSH induces such expression was investigated with the use of human microsomal antibody-positive serum and an indirect immunofluorescence technique. Studies were also performed to ascertain whether the M antigen of FRTL-5 cells could be identified with thyroid peroxidase (TPO), as suggested by recent data obtained in human thyroid tissue. Preabsorption experiments showed that, like solubilized human thyroid microsomes, purified human TPO completely abolished the binding of microsomal antibody to FRTL-5 cells. No inhibition was obtained by preabsorption with control human tissues (placenta, liver, and spleen) or human thyroglobulin, indicating that the antigen recognized by microsomal antibody in FRTL-5 cells was TPO. After 72 h of TSH withdrawal from the culture medium the M/TPO antigen disappeared from the surface and the cytoplasm of FRTL-5 cells. Readdition of TSH (250 microU/ml) to the culture medium of cells lacking the M/TPO antigen elicited its reappearance within 24-48 h. This effect of TSH was prevented by 10 microM cycloheximide or 0.5-5 micrograms/ml actinomycin D. Two well known stimulators of the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system, cholera toxin and forskolin, mimicked TSH in inducing the reappearance of the M/TPO antigen. A similar effect was observed with use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine. Reappearance of M/TPO antigen was also produced by the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP. The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate, which stimulates thyroid cell growth through a cAMP-independent pathway, was ineffective in inducing the M/TPO antigen in FRTL-5 cells. The present data indicate that 1) thyroid peroxidase accounts for most, if not all, of the microsomal antigen of FRTL-5 cells; and 2) TSH modulates the expression of the M/TPO antigen in FRTL-5 cells by a mechanism that involves cAMP production and requires mRNA formation and subsequent protein synthesis.\r"

Applied acutely, PMA produced a greater stimulation of ACTH/endorphin secretion than CRH or cAMP. However, the effects of CRH and cAMP on secretion were maintained for up to 12 days, while those of PMA and phenylephrine diminished rapidly. Secretagogue effects on pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthesis were determined by immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled beta-endorphin-related peptides. Cultures exposed to CRH or cAMP and [3H]tyrosine for 12 h produced 1.7 +/- 0.2- and 1.6 +/- 0.1-fold more newly synthesized beta-endorphin-related material than control cells. Cultures exposed to phenylephrine or PMA synthesized 1.3 +/- 0.1- and 1.4 +/- 0.1-fold more peptide than control cells. Exposure of cells to CRH or cAMP for 12 days increased pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthesis to a greater extent than the 12-h treatment (3.0 +/- 0.1- and 2.5 +/- 0.3-fold over control value, respectively). Exposure to phenylephrine or PMA for 12 days had the same effect on pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthesis as exposure for 12 h. After acute or chronic secretagogue exposure, the cells secreted relatively more newly synthesized beta-lipotropin than beta-endorphin. Levels of pro-ACTH/endorphin mRNA in cultures treated acutely (12 h) or chronically (12 days) with CRH, cAMP, or phenylephrine changed in parallel with rates of pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthesis. In contrast, chronic exposure to PMA stimulated biosynthesis while reducing pro-ACTH/endorphin mRNA levels. In summary, these results suggest that factors that activate cAMP-dependent pathways are more powerful stimulators of pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthesis than factors that activate cAMP-independent pathways; the cAMP-dependent pathway may be primarily responsible for regenerating depleted hormone reserves.\r"

The medium was replaced every 48 h, and the androsterone concentration in the culture supernatants was used as an index of androgen production. In the absence of added hormones (control) androsterone levels were consistently less than 0.1 ng/ml. Increasing concentrations of LH stimulated androsterone synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. IGF-I, in the absence of LH, did not significantly increase androsterone levels above control values. However, when combined with 10 ng/ml LH, IGF-I increased androsterone synthesis above levels seen with LH alone in a dose-related fashion: for example, the peak androsterone levels seen with LH and 100 ng/ml (13 nM) IGF-I at 96 h of culture were significantly greater than the peak level seen with 10 ng/ml LH alone (302 +/- 71 vs. 17 +/- 7 ng/ml; P less than 0.0125). Similarly, while insulin alone did not increase androsterone synthesis above control values, androsterone concentrations were increased by insulin in combination with 10 ng/ml LH; a peak value of 240 +/- 67.7 ng/ml was observed at 96 h of culture with 100 ng/ml (18 mM) insulin (P less than 0.025 vs. LH alone) Androsterone levels were slightly less with insulin than with IGF-I, but this difference was not significant. The combination of IGF-I and insulin did not increase levels of androsterone synthesis above those observed with each hormone alone. IGF-I bound to a high affinity binding site on ovarian cell monolayer cultures with an apparent binding affinity of 1.3 x 10(-9) M. Insulin also competed for binding with radiolabeled IGF-I in a dose-dependent manner, but the affinity of insulin was approximately 500-fold less; half-maximal inhibition of [125I] IGF-I binding occurred with an insulin concentration of approximately 300 nM (or approximately 1700 ng/ml). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of thecal-interstitial cell monolayers affinity labeled with radiolabeled IGF-I in the absence and presence of unlabeled hormone revealed proteins with characteristics of type I IGF receptors. Affinity labeling to a protein of a relative molecular mass of approximately 45,000 was also noted, probably representing IGF carrier proteins synthesized by thecal-interstitial cell monolayers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The thickness of the osteoid seams at the periphery of the bone nodules and the osteoid volume were measured in transplants as an index of bone formation. Impaired mineralization was evidenced in transplants of Hyp cells into Hyp mice by excessive osteoid thickness and volume compared with transplants of normal cells into normal mice. When normal cells were transplanted into mutant mice, the osteoid thickness and volume were markedly increased, demonstrating that the extracellular environment is critical for bone formation. In contrast, when Hyp cells were transplanted into normal mice, reduction, but not normalization, of the osteoid thickness and volume was observed. This abnormal bone formation supports the hypothesis of an osteoblast defect in the Hyp mouse.\r"

The basal and depolarization-induced release of [Gln8]LHRH in the presence and absence of the opiate agonists [D-Ala2,N-Phe4-Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAGO), which binds selectively to the mu-receptor subtype, and [D-Thr2,L-Leu5] enkephalyl-Thr (DTLET), which binds selectively to the delta-receptor subtype, and of the opiate antagonist naloxone was assessed in tissue obtained from birds at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks of age. Concentrations of LH and testosterone in plasma obtained from cockerels at the same ages rose progressively from 8-16 weeks of age. Between 16 and 20 weeks of age testosterone increased about 3-fold, whereas LH decreased significantly. Thereafter, LH rose in the face of sustained plasma testosterone concentrations. The initial rise in plasma LH concentrations was associated with a rise in the basal release of [Gln8]LHRH and a decrease in the ability of DAGO to inhibit and of naloxone to stimulate [Gln8]LHRH release. The delta-agonist DTLET did not affect secretion at any time. The fall in plasma LH at 20 weeks occurred despite an increased release of [Gln8]LHRH, whereas the subsequent rise in LH release occurred at a time when the pattern of [Gln8]LHRH release remained unchanged. These observations support the proposition that a decrease in tonic opioid inhibition of [Gln8]LHRH secretion during sexual maturation may explain why plasma LH concentrations rise in the face of sustained plasma testosterone concentrations. The changes in plasma LH concentrations that occur in the immediate pubertal period may be due, however, to a direct action of testosterone on the anterior pituitary lobe.\r"

Its activity is independent of insulin, although at pharmacological concentrations insulin may substitute for IGF-I. The maximal [3H]thymidine incorporation stimulated by either IGF-I or insulin was only 25-40% of that in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) only. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) exhibited low mitogenic activity which was not synergistic with IGF-I in serum-free medium. IGF-I and EGF had low synergistic activity when added separately to 10% FCS-supplemented medium. Strong synergism (100% or more) was observed, however, when both factors were added simultaneously, indicating that their maximum mitogenic effect is dependent on a simultaneous presence of other factors existing in FCS. The galactopoietic effect of IGF-I was tested in organ culture of bovine lactating mammary gland. Neither fatty acid synthesis nor alpha-lactalbumin secretion was stimulated by IGF-I, even at 2000 ng/ml. These results indicate that, at least in our in vitro system, galactopoiesis is not affected by IGF-I.\r"

  ".W": "Yearling rams actively immunized against GnRH were used as a hypogonadotropic model for studies of the significance of the pulsatility of LH secretion in determining the trophic actions of the hormone on testicular steroidogenesis. GnRH-immunized rams, in which testicular regression was complete, were infused iv for 12-20 days with ovine LH (NIDDK oLH 24) in three different regimens, delivering a total daily dose of 60 micrograms/100 kg: 1) 1-min pulses of 5 micrograms/100 kg every 2 h (low amplitude, high frequency), 2) 1-min pulses of 30 micrograms/100 kg every 12 h (high amplitude, low frequency), or 3) continuous infusion of 2.5 micrograms/100 kg.h. Serum testosterone levels and acute responses to LH challenges were monitored at intervals throughout the infusion periods. Acute responses to LH were evaluated in terms of the area under the curve for serum testosterone vs. time after LH and the lag time between the infusion of LH and attainment of maximum serum testosterone levels. At the beginning of the experiments, serum testosterone was at castrate values, and testosterone responses to LH were of low magnitude with a long lag time. LH infusion in the low amplitude, high frequency regimen consistently increased the magnitude and decreased the lag time of acute responses to LH; these effects were significant by the sixth day of treatment and persisted for the duration of the experiments. This regimen also had positive effects on morphological features of testes and Leydig cells. Infusion of the high amplitude, low frequency regimen, however, had neither of the positive effects on responsiveness to LH, but did seem to improve testicular and Leydig cell morphology. Continuous infusion of LH also increased the magnitude and decreased the lag time of responses to low amplitude pulses of LH, at least as well as the high frequency infusion regimen did. These results suggest that the high frequency, low amplitude pattern of LH secretion characteristic of reproductively active animals has trophic actions on the testes, increasing their responsiveness to acute gonadotropic stimulation, but the pulsatility of that pattern of LH secretion is not necessary for its trophic actions. The efficacy of high frequency LH secretion may depend only on the elevation of basal or mean LH concentrations, rather than on the low amplitude peaks or the dynamic changes in LH concentrations to which the testes are exposed.\r"

Contaminating fibroblasts were removed by treatment with sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate. The cultured islets remained functional for over 6 weeks in primary culture and up to 9 weeks in secondary culture, as indicated by their substantial insulin response to an acute glucose stimulus. Insulin secretion from islet monolayers showed biphasic kinetics. The functional competence of the monolayers was further evaluated by studying glucose-stimulated insulin release in the presence of various modulators of B-cell function. The response to physiological agents such as somatostatin, epinephrine, glucagon, and arginine was retained for at least 4 weeks in culture. The sensitivity to inhibition by somatostatin and epinephrine (ID50 = 10 ng/ml) and that to stimulation by glucagon (ED50 = 3 ng/ml) were similar to or better than those for freshly isolated islets. We have thus obtained a fibroblast-free monolayer culture of pancreatic islets from adult rats containing B-cells that retain normal function for long periods. This experimental system appears ideally suited for studying chronic modulations of islet cell function under controlled in vitro conditions, which can allow the stimulation of normal and diabetic environments.\r"

By immunocytochemistry 7B2 was colocalized with calcitonin in parafollicular cells and identified within secretory granules by electron microscopy. Three of nineteen human medullary carcinoma cases showed immunoreactive 7B2 within the early and late hyperplasia stages and neoplasia.

They have been performed using specific antibodies prepared against two distinct synthetic fragments of 7B2 comprising amino acids 23-39 and 117-128 of the native human molecule isolated from pituitary gland. Pancreatic insulin-secreting tumors produced in transgenic mice contain high amounts of 21,500- to 22,000-dalton forms of 7B2. Using light microscopy (immunocytochemical colocalization with different pancreatic hormones), immunoreactivity to 7B2 (IR-7B2) was consistently found within cells producing insulin and glucagon and less consistently within pancreatic polypeptide-containing cells. As in previous reports concerning the brain, adenohypophysis, and thyroid gland, IR-7B2 could be detected by electron microscopy within secretory granules of alpha- and beta-like cells in islets. Furthermore, the IR-7B2 level was higher in extracts of insulin-producing tumors of the transgenic mice that contained the hybrid insulin II gene. In addition, IR-7B2 could be detected immunocytochemically in three of seven tumors produced in the rat by streptozotocin-nicotinamide treatment.\r"

The stimulation parameters were: 2-2.5 V, 14 Hz, 1 msec for the albino mice and 3 V, 14 Hz, 1 msec or 15-20 V, 20 Hz, 1 msec for the spiny mice. Already 2 min after the start of the stimulation, the acomys as well as the albino mice showed a significant increase in plasma insulin levels which was accompanied by a weak but significant increase in glycemia. However, the total insulin output in the acomys mice was half than that of the albino mice. Carbachol administration had no effect on insulin secretion in the acomys mice, while it increased that of the controls. Atropine pretreatment failed to abolish the insulin release elicited by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in the acomys mice, while it abolished it in the albino ones. It is proposed that the vagus-nerve mediated insulin release that is present in the acomys mice is exerted, not via muscarinic receptors as in controls, but possibly via other neurotransmitter(s).\r"

Besides these classical types of cells, we found PRL- and GH-immunoreactive (type II PRL and GH) cells that contained small (approximately 100-200 nm in diameter) and round secretory granules. However, in female mice type II PRL or GH cells accounted for less than 3% of all parenchymal cells, as was also true for type II GH cells in the males. The percentages of type I and type II PRL cells in male mice were about the same (approximately 10% of all parenchymal cells). Only a few mammosomatotropes (0-0.6% of all parenchymal cells) were found in the mouse adenohypophysis of either sex. All mammosomatotropes were type II cells; none were PRL or GH cells of the classical type. This immunohistochemical study confirmed our previous findings by conventional electron microscopy that there are marked sex differences in the proportions of PRL and GH cells in the adult mouse adenohypophysis; PRL cells are more abundant in the female mice, and GH cells are more abundant in the males.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we reported that magnesium (Mg2+) enhanced the binding affinity of arginine vasopressin [( 3H]AVP) to a single class of sites in rat liver microsomes. In the present study we have examined the effects of divalent cations and guanine nucleotides on the binding characteristics of both the nonselective agonist and the V1 receptor-selective antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-[3H]AVP, to microsomal and plasma membrane fractions of rat liver. At a subsaturating concentration (100 pM) of [3H]AVP, divalent cations increased specific binding in a concentration-dependent manner with the following rank order of potency: Co2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Ni2+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Ca2+ = control. The maximal effect for Mg2+ was evident at 1 mM, a physiologically relevant concentration. In contrast, binding of the V1 receptor antagonist (at a subsaturating concentration of 10 pM) was inhibited by divalent cations, the rank order of potency being Mn2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Ni2+. The inhibitory effects of divalent cations were of lesser magnitude (up to 60%) compared to the stimulation of agonist binding (up to 700%). Mg2+ enhanced the affinity of [3H]AVP (Kd was decreased from approximately 2 nM to 133 pM), while the affinity of the [3H]V1 antagonist was decreased (Kd was increased from 10 to 95 pM). Scatchard analysis of saturation data (Mg2+ present) revealed similar maximum binding values for the binding of radiolabeled agonist and antagonist, indicating that AVP receptors in rat liver are mostly of the V1 subtype. Competition experiments between V1/V2-specific AVP analogs with either the radiolabeled agonist or antagonist also indicated the presence of predominantly V1 receptor sites in rat liver microsomes. The properties of plasma membrane receptor sites were similar to those of the microsomal sites, except that the density of receptors was higher in the former. In both equilibrium and competitive inhibition experiments GTPase-resistant analogs of guanine nucleotides, GTP gamma S and GDP beta S, decreased the affinity of the agonist for the receptor, but not that of the antagonist. Treatment of membranes with 0.2 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) reduced the maximum binding of [3H]AVP and abolished the GTP gamma S-evoked decrease in agonist-binding affinity. In contrast, antagonist binding was unaffected by NEM. NEM pretreatment failed to influence the divalent cation-dependent increase in agonist-binding affinity. The results provide direct evidence for the existence of a high and a low affinity state of the hepatic V1 receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats showed a significant lowering in both PRA (-31%) and basal plasma aldosterone concentration (-59%), coupled with a notable atrophy of the zona glomerulosa (-30%) and its parenchymal cells (-36%). Kalaemia and the blood level of ACTH were not affected. Insulin infusion reversed all the streptozotocin-evoked effects. Analogous, though less conspicuous, changes were induced by experimental diabetes also in rats whose hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system had been pharmacologically interrupted by the simultaneous administration of dexamethasone-captopril and maintenance doses of ACTH-angiotensin II: the drops in the basal plasma aldosterone concentration and in the volume of zona glomerulosa and its cells ranged from -20% to -22%. In these animals, experimental diabetes significantly depressed the aldosterone response to the acute stimulation with angiotensin II (-55%), potassium (-50%), and ACTH (-43%). These findings indicate that the well known impairment of renin release may only partially account for the antiadrenoglomerulotrophic effect of experimental diabetes in rats. The hypothesis is advanced that the chronic lack of insulin may directly depress both the growth of the zona glomerulosa and the newly synthesis of some enzymes of aldosterone synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Recently two lines of evidence have implicated that cellular heat shock proteins (hsp) may play a role in steroid hormonal regulation of target tissues. One is the demonstration that cellular 90K hsp (hsp-90) can complex with steroid receptors in vitro and inhibit their ability to interact with DNA, and second, the demonstration that in avian oviduct sex steroids can regulate the synthesis of hsp-108. As yet, there is no report that sex steroids can regulate hsp-90 synthesis, especially in mammalian tissues. In these studies we have examined the estrogenic regulation of murine uterine hsp-90. We report that ovariectomy reduces the uterine concentration of hsp-90, and estradiol causes a time-dependent increase in uterine hsp-90 as early as 4 h after steroid administration, reaching a maximum increase of 4-fold between 18-24 h. The effect is specific to estrogens and not elicited by other steroid hormones. It is also target tissue specific, such that it is seen with uterus and vagina and does not occur in nontarget tissue for estradiol, such as spleen. The possible physiological significance of estrogenic stimulation of uterine hsp-90 has been discussed.\r"

  ".U": "88283566\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of keoxifene (LY 156 758) on GnRH-stimulated LH release and its ability to antagonize estrogen actions were investigated in rat anterior pituitary cells. Estrogens exert either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on GnRH-induced LH secretion in rat pituitary cells depending on the incubation time with the steroid. When pituitary cells were treated for 24 h with 10(-9) M estradiol, the LH response to GnRH was clearly enhanced, and this effect was completely inhibited by 300 nM keoxifene. Short term treatment (4 h) of pituitary cells with 10(-9) M estradiol inhibits GnRH-stimulated LH release, and this effect was also blocked by keoxifene in a dose-dependent manner. In the absence of exogenous estrogen the treatment of pituitary cells for 4 h with increasing concentrations of keoxifene reduced the LH response to 10(-9) M GnRH only at very high concentrations (10(-5) M) of the antiestrogen. After treatment for 24 h, the inhibitory effect of keoxifene was evident at concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-8) M, with a reduction of GnRH-induced LH release by up to 60%. The effects of the antiestrogen were also analyzed in a dynamic culture system, in which pituitary cells grown on microcarrier beads were continuously perifused with medium and stimulated with GnRH in a pulsatile fashion. The LH response to a 2 min pulse of 10(-9) M GnRH was reduced in magnitude after 40 min of perifusion with 10(-9) M estradiol. When keoxifene (300 nM) was present at the same time, the LH response was identical to that observed in vehicle-treated cells. At the concentration of 300 nM, keoxifene per se did not change the responsiveness of the pituitary cells to the GnRH stimulus. These findings show that keoxifene is a potent antagonist of both positive and negative estrogen actions in the pituitary gonadotroph. In addition, after short term treatment with high concentrations or after long term treatment, keoxifene itself exerts an inhibitory effect on GnRH-induced LH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Growth factors, such as human transforming growth factor-alpha (hTGF alpha) and epidermal growth factor, as well as human tumor necrosis factor (hTNF) stimulate the resorption of bone in neonatal mouse calvariae in organ culture via a prostaglandin (PG)-mediated pathway. In response to such factors mouse calvariae produce substantial quantities of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostacyclin (PGI2). We have selectively inhibited the production of PGI2, but not PGE2, using the drug minoxidil and have measured the effects on stimulated bone resportion and arachidonic acid metabolism. The increased production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (6k-PGF1 alpha), the hydrolytic product of PGI2, stimulated by recombinant hTGF alpha and hTNF as well as murine epidermal growth factor was inhibited by minoxidil. There was no inhibition by minoxidil of PGE2 production. Despite essentially complete inhibition of stimulated 6k-PGF1 alpha formation, there was no inhibition of bone resorption. The possibility was investigated that growth factors and TNF enhanced enzymatic conversion of PGI2 to 6k-PGE1, which stimulates bone resorption in mouse calvariae with a potency about one fourth that of PGE2. Enzymatic conversion of PGI2 to 6k-PGE1 is inhibited by rutin. Rutin did not inhibit bone resorption stimulated by hTGF alpha or hTNF. We conclude, on the basis of these new results and previously published data, that the cyclooxygenase product that acts as the mediator of bone resorption enhanced by growth factors and TNF in mouse calvariae is probably PGE2.\r"

  ".W": "The evidence that supports the hypothesis that insulin and LH both regulate ovarian androgen production was presented. The most dramatic clinical example of the association between hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism is the HAIR-AN syndrome. Our hypothesis is that, in the HAIR-AN syndrome, the severe insulin resistance causes a compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which stimulates ovarian androgen production if adequate LH is present. The acanthosis nigricans is an epiphenomenon of the syndrome. Acanthosis nigricans is a dermatologic manifestation of severe insulin resistance. In vitro evidence suggests that insulin and IGF-I stimulate androgen production in incubations of human stroma and theca. The stromatropic effects of insulin may sensitize the stroma to the stimulatory effects of LH. In some hyperandrogenic-insulin-resistant women, a glucose load appears to produce an acute rise in circulating androgens. The magnitude of the rise in circulating androgens is proportional to the magnitude of the insulin response to the glucose load. These data suggest that hyperinsulinemia may play a central role in the development of ovarian hyperandrogenism.\r"

Significantly elevated levels of total leukocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes were also observed in peritoneal fluid from women with unexplained infertility. The results from this study indicate that the peritoneal environment is immunologically dynamic and suggest that cellular immune mechanisms may contribute to reproductive failure in women with endometriosis and unexplained infertility.\r"

Plasma CRH levels did not change during the exercise, and the mean CRH values did not differ between the amenorrheic and eumenorrheic groups. In both groups, significant increases in the response to exercise were found in the concentrations of ACTH and endorphins. The only significant difference between the groups was a larger mean pre-exercise concentration of endorphins in amenorrheic than in eumenorrheic athletes (4.8 +/- 0.8 standard error [SE] and 2.9 +/- 0.2 pmol/l, respectively). It is concluded that in amenorrheic athletes the capacity of the anterior pituitary to secrete ACTH and endorphins in response to exercise does not significantly differ from that in eumenorrheic athletes, although basal endorphin secretion may be increased.\r"

The evaluation of these women showed no major cause of infertility as evidenced by normal endocrine, cervical, uterine, and tubal factor studies. Their partners were either azoospermic or severely oligoasthenospermic. During the GIFT cycle, follicular development was induced with (1) clomiphene citrate (days 3 to 7) plus human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) from day 6 on or (2) human follicle-stimulating hormone (days 3 to 4) plus hMG (day 5 on), until ultrasound revealed 2 follicles 16 mm and serum estradiol (E2) was greater than 700 pg/ml. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 10,000 IU was administered, and 36 hours later follicular aspiration was performed. One to three oocytes and 100,000 motile sperm were transferred to each fallopian tube through the fimbria via laparoscopy or minilaparotomy. Twenty-seven clinical pregnancies were achieved (56%) per GIFT cycle. Eight miscarriages occurred during the first trimester (29% of all pregnancies), whereas no ectopic pregnancies were observed. These data conclusively show the value of the GIFT procedure in the treatment of cases with failed AID.\r"

  ".W": "Since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in September 1985, the Garren-Edwards gastric bubble has been extensively used as an adjunct to diet and behavioral modification in the treatment of exogenous obesity. In an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of the Garren-Edwards gastric bubble, a double-blind crossover study was undertaken. Ninety patients were randomized into three groups: bubble-sham, sham-bubble, and bubble-bubble in two successive 12-wk periods. Sixty-one patients completed the entire 24-wk study. All groups participated in ongoing diet and behavioral modification therapy in a free-standing obesity program, the members of which were blinded to randomization arms. All patient groups lost weight during this study. The mean cumulative weight loss in pounds at 12 wk was as follows: bubble-sham = 19, sham-bubble = 12, and bubble-bubble = 8; and at 24 wk: bubble-sham = 23, sham-bubble = 16, and bubble-bubble = 18. The mean cumulative change in body mass index (kg/m2) at 12 wk was as follows: bubble-sham = -3.1, sham-bubble = -2.3, and bubble-bubble = -2.9; and at 24 wk: bubble-sham = -3.1, sham-bubble = -3.0, and bubble-bubble = -3.3. Although weight loss occurred more consistently in patients with a Garren-Edwards gastric bubble, there were no significant differences between any of the three groups at 12 or 24 wk with respect to weight loss or change in body mass index. The major part of the weight loss noted during this study occurred during the first 12-wk period, irrespective of therapy (bubble or sham). Side effects observed during this study included gastric erosions (26%), gastric ulcers (14%), small bowel obstruction (2%), Mallory-Weiss tears (11%), and esophageal laceration (1%). We conclude that, in this study, the use of a Garren-Edwards gastric bubble did not result in significantly more weight loss than diet and behavioral modification alone in the management of exogenous obesity, and it may result in significant morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "In spite of the widespread use of the Garren-Edwards gastric bubble as an adjuvant device in weight reduction, its efficacy has not been established. Therefore, our purpose was to conduct a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of this device in the management of exogenous obesity. The study group consisted of 23 patients, 21 women and 2 men, ranging in age from 21 to 53 yr. Patients were 25%-111% above their ideal body weight. They were studied for 24 wk, consisting of two separate 12-wk evaluation periods. Patients were randomly assigned either to receive the gastric bubble or to have a sham procedure. After the first 12-wk evaluation period, the gastric bubble and sham were administered in crossover fashion, so that those who had received the gastric bubble initially received the sham later and vice versa. The study coordinator remained blind to the kind of treatment, weighed each patient biweekly, enforced dietary counseling, and provided behavior modification. Those who had passed or were found to have a deflated bubble at the end of the treatment period were excluded from the study. Mean weight reduction in the two evaluation periods did not differ significantly. Patients lost 5.4 +/- 1.7 kg (mean +/- SE) during the gastric bubble period and 5.20 +/- 0.8 kg during the sham period. The order of administration of the gastric bubble and sham did not significantly affect the result. The time-course of mean biweekly values, however, revealed that with the gastric bubble, weight loss was significantly greater only during first (p less than 0.005) and second (p less than 0.025) 2-wk evaluation periods. This difference, however, disappeared after the initial 4 wk of treatment. These observations suggest that although gastric bubble implantation reduced weight significantly more than the sham procedure initially, the mean weight loss during 12 wk of evaluation was not different between the two periods. In our opinion, the gastric bubble is of no value as an adjuvant device in weight reduction.\r"

  ".W": "Antral biopsy specimens from 89 consecutive patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and erosive prepyloric changes included in a prospective, randomized, double-blind 4-wk study of the effect of an aluminum-magnesium antacid (120 mmol/day) or pirenzepine (50 mg b.i.d.) vs. placebo were examined histologically. Campylobacter pylori (CP) was found by light microscopy of silver-stained sections in 25 patients (28%). Campylobacter pylori-positive patients were on average older than CP-negative patients (p = 0.02). There was a strong association between CP colonization and acute inflammation (p less than 0.001), both being rare in the absence of chronic inflammation. During treatment with antacids, the density of CP decreased (p less than 0.001) without any improvement of the inflammatory reaction. On the contrary, the number of patients with gastritis tended to increase after antacids as compared with placebo (p less than 0.10). A separate analysis showed no symptomatic effect of the drugs. Thus, neither nonulcer dyspepsia nor erosive prepyloric changes are strongly associated with antral CP colonization or acute inflammation. Aluminum-magnesium antacids may suppress antral CP infection without healing the gastritis or relieving symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Protoporphyria is an inherited disorder of heme biosynthesis characterized by an overproduction of protoporphyrin in the erythropoietic and hepatic tissues, the relative contribution of which in the metabolic disorder has not been directly quantitated. Excess protoporphyrin is eliminated solely by the liver into the bile and feces. We describe the case of a patient with protoporphyria complicated by severe cirrhosis in whom liver transplantation was performed and resulted in almost complete disappearance of skin photosensitivity manifestations and reduction in the level of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes. However, the level of protoporphyrin in feces was not markedly different before and after liver transplantation, which suggests that overproduction of protoporphyrin was unchanged. These findings are consistent with the view that the diseased liver and ensuing low hepatic clearance of protoporphyrin contributed to accumulation of protoporphyrin in the body and that, at least in this patient, the role of the hepatic tissue in the overproduction of protoporphyrin was small in comparison with that of the erythropoietic tissue.\r"

From eight weeks onwards there was a significant overall increase in calmodulin content concomitant with its segregation to the apical side of epithelial cells. At 14 weeks of gestation calmodulin concentrations and localisation closely resembled those of adults. The developmental pattern of calmodulin appeared to parallel the morphological and functional maturation of brush borders which occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. In the intestinal epithelial cells from a 19 weeks cystic fibrosis fetus and a cystic fibrosis newborn infant neither calmodulin concentration, nor its localisation were affected. Similarly, brush border calmodulin binding proteins and enzymatic activities were similar in normal subjects and the cystic fibrosis intestine.\r"

Stool examination was positive in all patients, but an average of three specimens (range 1-6) were required before a positive diagnosis was made. Other methods of diagnosis included jejunal and rectal biopsy and aspiration of the duodenal contents. Twenty three (89%) lived for six months from the time of diagnosis and 16 (60%) were alive at one year. Only five patients died as a direct result of cryptosporidial infection, while 10 other patients died from another complication of AIDS. Fifteen patients were enrolled in a prospective controlled study of erythromycin or spiramycin in the treatment of cryptosporidial diarrhoea. Most patients showed a significant response to antibiotic therapy but treatment was limited because of side effects. All patients responded to antidiarrhoeal agents, particularly long acting morphine sulphate. Three of our patients recently given zidovudine (AZT) have responded with a cessation of diarrhoea and cryptosporidia are no longer isolated from the stools.\r"

A slow intravenous injection of cisapride 10 mg significantly increased the sphincter pressure in the controls but even more in the patients in whom it almost doubled the resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressure of 8.7 (0.5) mm Hg to between 15 and 20 mm Hg for at least 90 min. Results are expressed as mean (SE). Cisapride also significantly increased the amplitude of peristaltic contractions in controls and reflux patients.

We have therefore compared sulphasalazine, low dose mesalazine and high dose mesalazine in the treatment of mild to moderate relapse of ulcerative colitis. Sixty one patients (32 men, aged 20-78 years) were randomly allocated to sulphasalazine 2 g daily, mesalazine 800 mg daily, or mesalazine 2.4 g daily in a double blind, double dummy, four week trial. Groups were comparable for age, sex, extent of disease, and pretrial sulphasalazine intake. Four patients were unable to complete the study because of treatment failure (two taking sulphasalazine and two high dose mesalazine). A further two patients taking sulphasalazine developed side effects necessitating withdrawal. Within treatment comparisons revealed significant improvement of: sigmoidoscopic grade in the sulphasalazine group; rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic and histological grade in the low dose mesalazine group; stool frequency, rectal bleeding and sigmoidoscopic grade in the high dose mesalazine group. Greater improvement in rectal bleeding (p less than 0.05) and sigmoidoscopic appearances (p less than 0.05) occurred in patients taking high dose mesalazine than in those taking sulphasalazine. In two patients taking high dose mesalazine minor rises of plasma creatinine concentrations occurred, suggesting the need to monitor renal function.\r"

Expiratory breath hydrogen excretion tended to decrease reflecting improvement of carbohydrate metabolism. Addition of glucomannan to an intraduodenal sucrose solution significantly raised plasma glucose nadirs, indicating glucomannan to be effective during the intestinal phase. It is concluded that small amounts of glucomannan may be beneficial to patients with reactive postprandial hypoglycaemia, without the disadvantage of unpalatability and carbohydrate malabsorption.\r"

  ".W": "The intestinal component of a graft-versus-host reaction (GvHR) provides a useful experimental model to elucidate the pathogenesis of clinical enteropathies which cause villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia and which are associated with a local immune response. One to three days after induction of GvHR in heavily irradiated (CBAxBALB/c)F1 mice, a proliferative form of enteropathy developed. Compared with controls, these mice had increased counts of jejunal intraepithelial lymphocytes and had a four-fold increase in crypt cell production rate as well as an increase in crypt length. These changes were accompanied by a marked enhancement of splenic natural killer cell activity. After day three, the crypt cell production rate fell to zero and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) which could lyse targets of host origin appeared. In parallel, mice with GvHR developed significant villus shortening and their clinical condition deteriorated. Further experiments showed that increased counts of intraepithelial lymphocytes, villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia also occurred in grafts of fetal CBA intestine implanted under the kidney capsule of (CBAxBALB/c)F1 mice with GvHR. As these grafts are syngeneic to the injected CBA spleen cells, they should not be attacked by anti-host cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We suggest that the proliferative and destructive components of enteropathy in GvHR are caused by lymphokines released by an anti-host delayed type hypersensitivity reaction.\r"

In addition, antigen transmission to lymph nodes as detected by indirect immunofluorescence using CD sera was observed in all inoculation groups. The immunofluorescent reaction also occurred independently of lymph node histology. Thus, we confirm that CD sera recognize an antigen(s) expressed in lymph nodes of athymic mice inoculated with CD tissue filtrates. The antibody (or antibodies) in CD sera was not specific for this 'CD antigen or antigens', however, as tested in the nu/nu mouse system, because the CD sera antibodies also recognised antigens in UC inoculated and OID inoculated animals.\r"

  ".W": "Sexual dysfunction is common in hypertensive men and often is first reported by patients while receiving hypotensive therapy, leading to a widespread belief by patients and physicians that the sexual dysfunction is caused by a specific antihypertensive medication. However, it is unclear from the literature whether this problem is related to hypertension or to its therapy. Further, whether the erectile failures reported during therapy are a result of 1) reduced penile blood flow secondary to reduction of blood pressure after antihypertensive treatment or to obstructive vascular disease (or both) or 2) specific drug effects has not been well studied. Because of these unresolved issues, this common problem is not well managed and contributes to noncompliance with therapy by hypertensive male patients, which impedes the attainment of satisfactory blood pressure control. The present article reviews the literature related to hypertension and sexual function in men and outlines a management strategy for clinicians that attempts to document normalcy of sexual function before initiating treatment in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. Further, it does not ascribe causality to specific antihypertensive agents for the sexual dysfunction reported by treated hypertensive patients but attempts instead to delineate the pathogenesis of the dysfunction. Once the pathogenesis is established, treatment plans can be implemented to restore normotension and maintain adequate sexual function among treated hypertensive men. The article also discusses how applied research in this area may be performed.\r"

All subjects were placed on a diet containing 8 to 10 g of sodium chloride per day. Lymphocyte sodium concentration was higher in hypertensive patients than in normotensive controls (19.8 +/- 1.8 vs 18.4 +/- 1.8 mmol/kg wet weight; p less than 0.01), whereas lymphocyte potassium concentration was similar in both groups. Lymphocyte free calcium concentration was also higher in hypertensive patients than in normotensive controls (134.6 +/- 13.2 vs 120.2 +/- 16.4 nmol/L; p less than 0.01). There was a positive correlation between lymphocyte sodium and free calcium concentrations in normotensive controls, in hypertensive patients, and in the subjects combined (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01; r = 0.71, p less than 0.001; and r = 0.70, p less than 0.001, respectively). Lymphocyte potassium concentration was not related to lymphocyte sodium or free calcium concentration in each group. In patients with essential hypertension, intracellular sodium and free calcium concentrations were negatively correlated with plasma renin activity (r = -0.66, p less than 0.001; r = -0.60, p less than 0.001, plasma norepinephrine concentration. These results suggest that a considerable relationship exists between intracellular sodium and free calcium in lymphocytes and that, in essential hypertension, the alteration in cellular metabolism of sodium and calcium may be linked to the renin system but not to blood pressure, age, or adrenergic activity.\r"

  ".W": "The sympathetic nervous system is an important factor that can induce increased renin secretion by the kidney. In recent years, the notion has arisen that the sympathetic nervous system may also function to set the level of responsiveness of the kidney to nonneural stimuli for renin secretion. However, evidence in favor of this possibility has come primarily from studies employing direct electrical stimulation of renal nerves, and no attempt has been made to determine if central neural sites can also influence the responsiveness of the kidney. In the present study, the ability of hypothalamic activation to enhance the renin response to suprarenal aortic occlusion was investigated. Conscious, freely moving rats with an inflatable cuff placed around the aorta were used to determine the relationship between renal-perfusion pressure and plasma renin activity in the control state and during continuous low-level stimulation of the paraventricular nucleus. The stimulation resulted in a rightward shift in the curve that related renal perfusion pressure to plasma renin activity; that is, for any given decrease in renal perfusion pressure, the plasma renin activity was greater during the ongoing stimulation. This rightward shift appeared to be mediated by increased renal nerve activity, since renal denervation prevented the shift. These data indicate that the hypothalamus, which plays an important role in regulating sympathetic activity, is capable of increasing the sensitivity of the kidney to a nonneural stimulus for renin secretion. This effect may become important in certain hypertensive and prehypertensive states where central neural activity is thought to be enhanced.\r"

The major effect of a decrease in ozone will be an increase in the amount of UV-B radiation in sunlight. Even a small increase in UV-B radiation will almost certainly affect human health. The most obvious effect of increased UV-B radiation will be an increase in the incidence of basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Other possible effects include a contribution to the development of cutaneous melanoma, ocular changes leading to the formation of cataracts, and immunologic perturbations.\r"

  ".W": "Retinoids, the natural and synthetic analogs of vitamin A, and alpha-interferon have been used effectively in the treatment of certain cutaneous premalignancies and malignancies. Retinoids have shown impressive activity against premalignant disorders of the skin (actinic keratoses, keratoacanthoma, epidermodysplasia verruciformis) and of other epithelial sites (oral leukoplakia, cervical dysplasia). In established basal cell skin cancers, topical retinoid treatment has produced a complete response rate of 33%, and systemic retinoids have produced an objective response rate of 51%. In advanced squamous cell skin cancers, systemic retinoids have produced a response rate of over 70%. Intralesional alpha-interferon has produced impressive responses and systemic alpha-interferon has produced a 50% objective response rate in basal and squamous cell carcinoma. Retinoid therapy and alpha-interferon have produced modest overall results in melanoma, although striking individual responses have been reported. In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which is notably refractory to chemotherapy, retinoids and alpha-interferon have produced responses in 60%+ and 70%+ of cases, respectively. Retinoids and alpha-interferon, either alone or in combination, offer exciting prospects for primary and neoadjuvant therapy for advanced malignancy. Retinoids also show promise as relatively nontoxic preventive and adjuvant therapy. Researchers should focus on integrating these drugs with other biological response modifiers, differentiation agents, and cytotoxic drugs for treating advanced malignancy.\r"

The growth of melanoma metastases represents the endpoint of many lethal events that few tumor cells can survive. Primary tumors consist of multiple subpopulations of cells with heterogeneous metastatic properties, and the outcome of metastasis depends on the interplay of metastatic tumor cells with various host factors. This viewpoint is more optimistic than that of metastasis as a random process. A selective biological process is regulated by the interaction of tumor cells with their host, and these complex interactions can now be studied and manipulated.\r"

The use of sunscreens is, and will continue to be, the most effective method of preventing human skin cancer. As these agents become more effective, especially against long-wave UV radiation, and as patients begin to use them more conscientiously, we should experience a decrease in skin cancer rates. In addition, a number of chemical agents are presently being investigated as anticarcinogens, especially in those patients who are at high risk for the development of skin cancers. A number of these hold promise as safe and effective chemopreventatives in reducing the morbidity and mortality of cancer in human skin.\r"

The criteria for IGTS were (1) 1- or 2-hour postprandial glucose levels between 160 and 200 mg/dL (8.8 to 11.1 mmol/L); (2) compliance with the diet; and (3) no cardiac or renal complication. The mean increment in the area under the plasma glucose and insulin curves after a glucose load was significantly greater following glucose than following fructose ingestion in both IGTS and NGTS (p less than .05). Glycosylated hemoglobin was greater after glucose than after fructose ingestion in IGTS and NGTS (71 gm/L vs. 61 gm/L in IGTS; 61 gm/L vs. 59 gm/L in NGTS). Serum triglyceride level in IGTS fed glucose was 173 mg/dL (1.90 mmol/L), whereas in those fed fructose, it was 154 mg/dL (1.69 mmol/L). Serum cholesterol was also greater after glucose than after fructose ingestion in all subjects. However, the differences were not statistically significant. Urate, pyruvate, and lactate levels were significantly greater in IGTS fed glucose than in IGTS fed fructose. Systolic and diastolic pressures were lower in IGTS fed fructose than in IGTS fed glucose. The present study shows that a 4-week oral ingestion of moderate amounts of fructose appears to have more benefits than an equivalent glucose ingestion in both IGTS and NGTS. However, greater benefits were found in IGTS than in NGTS.\r"

Critical examination of the studies shows that many have methodological problems that limit their usefulness. Problems include the absence of a placebo treatment, confounding with time, inadequate measurement of food intake, very low doses of fiber, inappropriately short treatment and observation periods, and multiple changes in the diet. The reviewed evidence indicates that supplementation with wheat bran has no effect on energy intake or body weight; however, other types of fiber may have an effect. Four studies showed that fiber supplementation resulted in a 0.2 to 0.4 kg/week greater weight loss in the treatment than in the control subjects. One study showed a decrease of 1,071 kcal/week in a subject's spontaneous intake. None of the studies reviewed followed subjects for longer than 3 months.\r"

Clonal and quantitative analysis of this response revealed that this is due partly to a 14-fold increased IgE precursor frequency and partly to a three-fold increased clone size of IgE-secreting cells. IL-4 increased the precursor frequency and the clone size of IgM-secreting cells not more than twofold. Both the IgM and IgE response in LPS-stimulated B cells were completely inhibited by the addition of anti-IgM mAb (M41) to the cultures, indicating that the IgE-secreting clones developed as subclones from precursors that express IgM. These cells lacked expression of membrane-bound IgE up to day 5 of the culture. Application of feeder cells in these cultures resulted in an increased precursor frequency of IgE-secreting clones among LPS-reactive B cells that is due, partially, to IL-4 produced by the feeder cells.\r"

  ".W": "To gain insight into the prolonged susceptibility to infections noted after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), multiple parameters of the humoral immune system were serially monitored in ten bone marrow recipients. IgM B cells appeared in the circulation 2 to 4 mo after engraftment. During the first 6 mo, the IgM B cells expressed low levels of CD21 (C3d/EBV receptors) and were largely CD38+. IgG and IgA B cells were also found to coexpress surface IgM and IgD, indicating that they may be involved in a process of isotype switch. These features are characteristic of neonatal B cells. To explore the pattern of Ig isotype switch, the emergence of plasma cell precursors for each of the four IgG subclasses was examined by culturing blood lymphocytes with PWM or LPS and enumerating bone marrow plasma cells. A marked IgG2 and IgG4 plasma cell deficiency and a relative increase in IgG1 and IgG3 plasma cells were detected both in vitro and in vivo. Serum IgG2 and IgG4 levels were deficient for more than 18 mo after BMT, elevated IgG1 levels accounting for the normal or increased levels of total IgG. The data suggest that a selective unresponsiveness to polysaccharide Ag and IgG2 subclass deficiency may contribute to the late bacterial infections in BMT recipients. These features of gradual development of the humoral immune system in adults undergoing successful marrow engraftment reproduce some of the maturational steps that occur during normal B cell ontogeny over the first 1 to 2 yr of life.\r"

However, the patterns of histamine and tryptase release over a period of up to 9 h of Ag exposure were different. Whereas rates of release of both histamine and tryptase peaked within 1 h in an Ag dose-response fashion, that of tryptase decreased progressively thereafter and was not different from buffer challenge sites from the 5th to 9th h at all concentrations of Ag tested. The rate of histamine release reached a plateau after 2 h and remained at a constant low level throughout the 3rd to 9th h of Ag incubation. Rechallenge of the sites continuously exposed to Ag with a different second Ag at the 6th h resulted in a second peak of release of both histamine and tryptase. This persistence of in vivo histamine but not tryptase release during the later time points of the cutaneous allergic response differs from what has been demonstrated in vitro with dispersed mast cells. Whether this reflects basophil participation at these time points or an as yet undetermined mechanism for release of histamine but not tryptase by mast cells is not known. These novel patterns of mediator release after prolonged Ag exposure in vivo may have clinical relevance to allergic diseases during which atopic subjects are exposed to Ag over several hours to days.\r"

The unpurified synthetic hGM-CSF had the same range of actions on hemopoietic cells as the purified recombinant protein. The structural requirements for the activities of synthetic hGM-CSF were examined by the design and synthesis of fragments and analogs. The synthetic fragment, hGM-CSF (54-127), containing all four of the cysteine residues found in the intact protein, lacked detectable activity. Assays of fragments shortened at the N terminus showed that the residues 1-13 were not required for activity, but that the integrity of residues 14-25, particularly residues 16, 17, and 18, was critical for biologic activity. The 14-25 region is predicted to form the first alpha-helix in hGM-CSF. Synthetic peptides within the N-terminal 53 residue region lacked detectable activity. The synthetic analog hGM-CSF (1-121), which lacks the C-terminal 6 residues, had similar activity to hGM-CSF (1-127) indicating that residues 122-127 are not required for activity. An analog, [Ala88] hGM-CSF (14-96), which lacks the hydrophobic C-terminal region and 2 cysteine residues, had low but readily detectable activity suggesting that residues 14-96 are sufficient for detectable synthetic hGM-CSF activity, although the presence of residues 97-121 are required for full activity. No dissociation of the multiple biological activities of hGM-CSF was detected.\r"

  ".W": "Antibody response to the phosphocholine (PC) epitope on Streptococcus pneumoniae R36a (Pn), a T-independent Ag type 2, was studied in H-2 congenic mouse strains. The PC-specific antibody plaque-forming cells (PFC) were enumerated in the spleen at various intervals after the primary Pn injection, and the proportion of PFC that produced antibody expressing the AB1-2 idiotope (Id) was determined by using the corresponding monoclonal anti-Id. AB1-2 is a cross-reactive Id, detectable on germline-encoded PC antibody of the T15 family, and on most, but not all, somatic variants of that antibody. The specific PFC responses in BALB/c (H-2d) and BALB.B (H-2b) strains were of comparable magnitude and most, if not all, PFC were ABl-1 Id-positive (AB1-2+). This was not the case in the responses of the B10D2 (H-2d) vs C57BL/10 (H-2b) strains and the D1.C (H-2d) vs D1.LP (H-2b) strains (on DBA/1 background). In each of these pairs, the H-2d mice were high responders, and the response was dominated by AB1-2 Id (greater than or equal to 80% AB1-2+ PFC at the peak, on day 5). The H-2b mice were low responders, and only a minor proportion of PFC (less than or equal to 30%) were AB1-2+; an increase of AB1-2+ was seen later in the response (d.10). The results of PFC assays were confirmed by measuring the PC-binding antibody and AB1-2 Id in the sera of D1.C and D1.LP mice immunized repeatedly with Pn. Moreover, D1.LP mice that had very low levels of AB1-2 Id had higher serum levels of antibody expressing two other T15 Id, B36-82, and B24-44. The B36-82 and B24-44 Id have been previously found on somatic variants of PC antibody expressed independently of the Ab1-2 Id. The concentrations of these two Id in D1.LP mice after repeated immunization approached those in D1.C. These results indicate that 1) the H-2 allelism may have a significant effect on TID antibody response in mice of a certain genetic background, but not in the BALB/c; and 2) the idiotypic repertoire of the response may be influenced by H-2 at the level of clonal variants of PC-reactive cells.\r"
