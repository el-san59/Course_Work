The etiology may be a longer left spermatic vein with its right-angle insertion into the left renal vein and/or absence of valves, which causes a higher hydrostatic pressure in the left spermatic vein causing dilatation. The nutcracker phenomenon is also a possible etiology. Much of the pathophysiology is still unknown, but increased blood flow causing an elevated intratesticular temperature may be of significance. Though there are many recent reports on the importance of a subclinical varicocele, we are not convinced of its significance. The best method for diagnosis remains a good clinical examination. The incidence of adolescents with varicocele is about the same as men with varicocele (approximately 15 per cent). Adolescents with varicocele should be treated if the testicular mass is decreased or if they are symptomatic. Surgical ligation is still the preferred method of treatment. Percutaneous treatment of varicoceles has an approximately 11 per cent incidence of minor complications and an occlusion rate of 73 per cent with a recurrence rate of 5 per cent. We reserve percutaneous treatment for recurrent varicoceles after surgical ligation, but primary percutaneous therapy is a reasonable approach.\r"

Clearly, the choice of therapy for impotence must now be made on an individual basis after a careful diagnostic evaluation and in-depth consultation with the patient.

Disruption of any component, from the embryologic development of the mullerian duct through the medications used for nonrelated systemic disease, can alter the efficient function of ejaculation. Evaluation of the urologic patient who has any of a number of abnormal ejaculatory states requires an understanding of the many possible mechanisms of failure. The majority of these men need evaluation because of a possible male-factor infertile marriage. The potential for improvement is significant, given the development of improved techniques to stimulate ejaculation and the promise shown by extracorporeal fertilization techniques such as in vitro fertilization and gamete intrafallopian tube transfer. These patients deserve complete assessment and optimization of any factors that will enable them to achieve their goal of procreation.\r"

The area of sex selection is under intensive investigation, and a reliable method of separation will undoubtedly become available in the near future. To the extent that these techniques would be used to help couples avoid sex-linked genetic diseases, preimplantation gender selection is ethically justifiable.

In-vitro fertilization promises to become a viable treatment option for couples with male-factor infertility. Research on male contraception may lead to the development of safe and reversible male contraceptives.\r"

  ".W": "Although nerve crossover surgery to bypass a spinal cord lesion and recentralize the decentralized bladder was first conceptualized in 1907, surprisingly few studies concerning this goal have been reported since. In addition to direct implantation of nerves into the detrusor, the studies reviewed have investigated the crossover of mixed roots (with and without nerve grafts), dorsal roots, ventral roots, pelvic, obturator and hypogastric nerves both in animal models, in human cadavers, and in human patients. Restoration of the micturition reflex through the use of nonsacral nerves has been achieved in cats. In addition, we have shown that the axons of a suprasacral mixed root (L7) when anastomosed to a sacral mixed root (S1) via a nerve graft can regenerate and recentralize the unilaterally decentralized bladder in the cat. The return of the micturition reflex after reconstruction of severed pelvic nerves has been documented, while the results of obstruction or hypogastric crossover have given diminished returns of bladder function. The direct implantation of nerves into the detrusor has not resulted in restoration of function. In addition, return of useful bladder function in humans after nerve crossover surgery has not been predictable. In part, present inability to achieve restoration of urinary bladder function may be a consequence of the complexity of micturition reflex organization and the inability to use techniques in humans that have given success in animals. Although, some of the technical aspects of nerve crossover surgery to bypass a spinal cord injury and restore functional micturition in those with neurogenic bladder dysfunction have been elucidated, further work is required to develop techniques that will enhance appropriate axonal regeneration to achieve reinnervation and return of useful function. Indeed, restoration of function may be limited by current microsurgical methodologies. Studies directed at understanding the neuropathophysiology of nerve injury and nerve surgery may be more fruitful in identifying factors than can be manipulated to achieve consistent return of useful function. In general, however, the results of the animal and human studies surveyed may be viewed with cautious optimism.\r"

Cholangiograms were reviewed retrospectively in 31 transplant patients who had proved complete or partial occlusions of the hepatic artery (thrombosis in 29 and marked stenosis in two). Cholangiograms were abnormal in 26 (84%). The most common abnormality, seen in 16 patients, was nonanastomotic contrast leakage from the donor intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts. Strictures of the donor biliary tree occurred in 14 patients, four of whom also had a nonanastomotic bile leak. In 12 of the 14, the strictures were nonanastomotic. Other findings included poor filling of the intrahepatic bile ducts, generalized donor ductal dilatation and irregularity, and intraductal filling defects. Sixteen (89%) of 18 transplants with nonanastomotic contrast leakage had occlusions of the hepatic artery. Of 21 transplants with nonanastomotic strictures, 12 (57%) had occlusions of the hepatic artery. Only two (10%) of 20 transplants with biliary anastomotic strictures had arterial occlusion. We conclude that liver transplant recipients who exhibit nonanastomotic contrast leakage or nonanastomotic strictures on cholangiography should be evaluated for occlusion of the hepatic artery as the probable cause.\r"

Dynamic CT performed during infusion of contrast medium via the superior mesenteric artery (arterial portography) showed portal blood flow within the lesion and was useful for excluding the presence of a hepatic tumor. Focal fatty infiltration of the liver adjacent to the falciform ligament constitutes a diagnostic pitfall on CT and sonography.\r"

Two sonographic features were significantly more prevalent in amebic abscesses: the lesions had a round or oval shape and the lesions had an echogenicity that was lower than that of normal liver and were internally homogeneous on high-gain scans. Amebic abscesses were round or oval in 92 instances (82%), while 18 pyogenic abscesses (60%) (p less than .01) had these shapes. Fifty-nine (58%) of 101 amebic abscesses displayed low echogenicity and homogeneous internal echoes with high-gain settings compared with nine (36%) of 25 pyogenic abscesses (p less than .04). Despite these different sonographic patterns, image findings alone were inadequate in distinguishing pyogenic from amebic liver abscesses. However, when the sonographic findings were coupled with clinical and laboratory data, a correct diagnosis was possible in 83 (86%) of 96 patients with amebic abscess. It appears that, although some sonographic features of amebic abscess differ from those of pyogenic abscess, these differences are not sufficient to allow a specific diagnosis on the basis of sonography alone. Sonography can expedite abscess detection and, when coupled with clinical and laboratory data, can aid in differentiating pyogenic from amebic liver abscesses.\r"

Positive findings included extrinsic bladder compression (nine patients), filling of the transplanted duodenal segment (three patients), edematous bladder wall (four patients), intraperitoneal (two patients) and extraperitoneal (four patients) leaks, and fistulae (two patients). Intraperitoneal extravasation resulted in abscess formation and cutaneous fistulae, and these transplants were subsequently removed. We conclude that cystography is a useful technique in evaluating the site and extent of anastomotic leaks and fistulae.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the role of pulsed Doppler flow analysis (duplex sonography) in making this distinction. Duplex Doppler sonography was performed in 106 patients with normally functioning transplanted kidneys and in 34 patients with renal transplant dysfunction who underwent percutaneous biopsy. Renal vascular impedance was estimated in the segmental, interlobar, and arcuate arteries by calculating the ratio of end-diastolic minimum velocity to systolic peak velocity (diastolic/systolic ratio). In the healthy control subject, the diastolic/systolic velocity ratios varied in the different arterial segments, ranging from a mean of 0.23 in the segmental arteries to a mean of 0.32 in the arcuate arteries. Seventeen patients experienced acute rejection: eight of the nine with acute vascular rejection had abnormal Doppler ratios; eight patients with acute cellular rejection had normal ratios. Nine patients with cyclosporine nephrotoxicity all had normal duplex scans. Seven patients with chronic rejection had normal ratios. One patient with hemolytic-uremic syndrome had an abnormal flow pattern. These findings indicate that duplex sonography may be useful in differentiating acute vascular rejection from cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in the transplanted kidney.\r"

Four different types of lesions were created: eight vertical concentric tears, four horizontal tears, four vertical radial tears, and four complex lesions including displaced or amputated meniscal edges. All 20 (100%) of the lesions were visualized sonographically. The vertical concentric tears were the easiest to locate and identify, and appeared as highly echogenic lines in the menisci. Tears of this type as small as 2 mm could be visualized. The vertical radial tears were the most difficult to visualize, and no lesions of this type smaller than 5 mm could be seen. Our study shows that under optimal experimental conditions, sonography is capable of reliably demonstrating even small meniscal tears. On this basis, we believe that further clinical studies of the efficacy of meniscal sonography are both reasonable and necessary.\r"

  ".W": "A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of nifedipine, metoprolol and their combination was conducted in 338 patients with unstable angina (hospital admission diagnosis) who had not previously received treatment with a beta blocker. In addition, nifedipine was compared with placebo in 177 patients who were receiving beta blockers upon hospital admission. The main outcome event was the recurrence of ischemia or progression to myocardial infarction within 48 hours. Trial medication effects are expressed as ratios of event rates relative to placebo, e.g., for nifedipine as the event rate under nifedipine divided by that under placebo; 95% confidence intervals are also given. In patients not pretreated with a beta blocker the rate ratio for nifedipine was 1.15 (0.83, 1.64), for metoprolol 0.76 (0.49, 1.16) and for the combination 0.80 (0.53, 1.19). In patients already receiving a beta blocker, the addition of nifedipine was favorable and the rate ratio was 0.68 (0.47, 0.97). Equal numbers of patients developed myocardial infarction and reversible ischemia. Most infarctions occurred early, within 6 hours of randomization. In patients who were not already taking a beta blocker, the nifedipine rate ratio for infarction only was 1.51 (0.87, 2.74). These results suggest that, in patients not previously receiving beta blockers, metoprolol has a beneficial short-term effect on unstable angina, that a fixed combination with nifedipine provides no further gain and that nifedipine may be ineffective or counterproductive. On the other hand, the addition of nifedipine to existing beta blockade when the patient becomes unstable seems beneficial.\r"

Several secondary preventive approaches have been made to prolong life in these patients. Long-term controlled trials involving nonsurgical measures and at least 100 patients will be reviewed. Lipid-lowering regimens have shown no demonstrable effect on survival over a 4- to 6-year period but show some benefit with respect to nonfatal infarction. Survival was not improved essentially by anticoagulants, antiarrhythmic agents or calcium channel blockers, although new trials are underway that might clarify their role. Platelet-active drugs achieved little reduction in mortality but showed benefit in nonfatal infarction (30% reduction with aspirin). Pooled data on physical exercise programs demonstrated a 15% benefit on mortality but larger trials are required to confirm this. The data on beta blockers (particularly those without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) show that these drugs improve long-term survival after myocardial infarction, reducing all-cause mortality by as much as 25% to 30%. Larger trials are necessary to detect statistically significant reductions in mortality both overall and in selected subgroups of patients.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of atenolol in preventing episodes of transient ischemia during daily life was evaluated in 10 patients with \"mixed\" angina who underwent a 4-week, single-blind, double-crossover placebo-controlled trial. On day 6 and 7 of each treatment phase, continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed for 48 hours. On day 7 an exercise test was also performed. Two-hundred and sixty-four ischemic episodes (79% \"silent\") were recorded during placebo treatment; 98 were recorded during atenolol treatment (63% decrease, p less than 0.01). In agreement with previous observations, most ischemic episodes observed during placebo (156 or 59%) were not preceded by an increase in heart rate. Surprisingly, the beneficial effects of atenolol were more pronounced for these episodes than for those preceded by an increase in heart rate and apparently caused by an increase in myocardial demand (decreases of 72% and 48%, respectively). Painful and painless episodes were decreased by a similar extent. In all patients, the heart rate recorded at the beginning of ST-segment depression was widely variable and significantly lower with atenolol (64 +/- 14 beats/min) than with placebo (81 +/- 13 beats/min, p less than 0.05). During both placebo and atenolol treatment, the highest incidence of ischemic events was observed between 6 A.M. and 9 P.M., in coincidence with the highest levels of the heart rate resting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous beta blockers given early in acute myocardial infarction have been shown to reduce chest pain, enzyme release and incidence of arrhythmias. Data published before the first report of the ISIS-1 group (International Studies of Infarct Survival) showed a 12% decrease in the probability of death using intravenous beta blockade but with large confidence limits. This study assessed and compared the effects of early intravenous atenolol and control treatment in the first week and first year after acute myocardial infarction in 16,027 patients. The principal endpoint was vascular death; most of the 15% decrease in mortality occurred in the first 24 to 36 hours with a significant difference at 1 week (313 vs 365 deaths in the atenolol and control groups, respectively). There was no rebound effect after stopping treatment after 7 days. Mortality at 1 year also showed a significant difference in favor of the atenolol group. Subgroup analysis found no significant difference in mortality by age, sex, initial heart rate, diabetes or entry electrocardiogram but data-derived analysis revealed a highly significant decrease in mortality if treatment began within 2 hours of the onset of pain. There was a significant 1% to 2% excess in inotrope use in the atenolol group in the first 36 hours, and first-degree heart block and bundle branch block emerged as relative contraindications to this treatment. The results suggest that early intravenous beta blockade in acute myocardial infarction is safe and effective and also cost effective in comparison with postdischarge oral beta blockade therapy.\r"

  ".U": "87295736\r", 
  ".W": "The vascular disruption produced by angioplasty initiates platelet deposition through the processes of platelet adhesion and recruitment of circulating platelets to form an enlarging mural platelet thrombus. Thrombin produced by simultaneous activation of the coagulation cascade by subendothelial connective tissue structures enhances platelet deposition and stabilizes the forming thrombus with enmeshing fibrin. Platelet recruitment involves the expression of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor for fibrinogen and other cytoadhesive proteins including fibronectin, thrombospondin and von Willebrand factor. Platelet deposition and thrombus formation caused by angioplasty appear to be important in the development of 2 complications: acute thrombotic occlusion and restenosis. Experimental mechanical vascular injury produces a predictable, although rather variable, amount of vascular narrowing due to transient smooth muscle cell proliferative intimal lesion formation. This intimal thickening by proliferating smooth muscle cells is in part mediated by platelet mitogens, particularly platelet-derived growth factor, which are released into the damaged vessel from platelets at the time of angioplasty. Platelet-derived growth factor may also be released from other associated vascular and blood cells in response to mechanical injury, e.g., endothelium, monocyte/macrophage and smooth muscle cells themselves. The actual mitogens, and their cells of origin, that mediate restenosis after therapeutic angioplasty remain to be established. Various oral antiplatelet agents have been shown to reduce arterial thrombotic occlusion in a number of controlled clinical trials, e.g., aspirin in transient ischemic attacks and unstable angina, aspirin and dipyridamole in saphenous vein coronary artery bypass and progression of peripheral vascular disease and dipyridamole in artificial heart valves. Acute arterial thrombosis may require more potent, immediate and transient intervention, e.g., monoclonal antibody to platelet receptor expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) remains the principal factor preventing broader application of this form of myocardial revascularization. Several methodologic variables contribute to the quality of the angioplasty result and may directly or indirectly influence restenosis rates after the procedure. PTCA operators attempt to minimize thrombotic activity at the angioplasty site by delaying PTCA when thrombus is present, with heparin and antiplatelet agents and with thrombolytic agents if thrombus is identified during the procedure. Therapy directed at preventing coronary artery spasm with nitrates and calcium antagonists has no proven efficacy in preventing restenosis. Residual stenosis and pressure gradient have been shown to be predictors of restenosis. Retrospective studies have indicated that a balloon to artery diameter ratio greater than 1 favors long-term patency; however, preliminary results of a prospective randomized study suggested that acute complications were more frequent with larger balloons. The interplay of other balloon-related variables (maximal inflation pressure, number of inflations, duration of inflations, balloon material and length of balloon) and the potential influence on restenosis are discussed. Recommendations for patient management after PTCA are also offered. A number of prospective randomized trials using antiplatelet agents and modification of risk factors are underway to test ability of these strategies to influence restenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Balloon angioplasty enlarges atherosclerotic narrowings in the vast majority of patients in whom it is attempted at an acceptably low complication rate. Experimental and human pathologic studies have confirmed that angioplasty enlarges the lumen by stretching the vessel wall. Often this stretching process causes plaque fracture due to inelastic components of the atheroma. Denudation of the endothelium is also a consistent observation. While enlarging the lumen, this vascular trauma promotes marked platelet adhesion and aggregation that is dependent on the degree of vascular damage. Most platelets accumulate early within the first few hours. Subsequently, thrombus formation and smooth muscle cell proliferation can occur with the formation of a new fibrocellular occlusive process. Experimentally, antiplatelet therapy can significantly reduce platelet deposition and can reduce the incidence of restenosis. Although restenosis is a multifactoral process, prevention seems possible when platelet accumulation, thrombus formation and smooth muscle cell proliferation can be inhibited through drug or mechanical means.\r"

  ".W": "Of 576 patients with non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction enrolled in the Diltiazem Reinfarction Study, 246 (43%) had 1 or more episodes of angina at rest or with minimal effort during 10.5 days of treatment with either diltiazem (90 mg every 6 hours) or placebo. Reinfarction (12.2% vs 3.6%, p less than 0.0001) or death (6.1% vs 1.5%, p = 0.003) was more likely to occur within 2 weeks of randomization in patients with postinfarction angina than in those without angina. Based on serial electrocardiographic data, 115 of the 246 patients with angina had transient ST-T changes and 131 did not. Comparison of the 14-day event rates in these 2 groups showed that the 115 patients with electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia had a higher frequency of reinfarction (20% vs 5.3%, p less than 0.001), more extensive damage as assessed by peak MB-creatine kinase levels (91 +/- 76 vs 37 +/- 19 IU/liter, p = 0.059 [Wilcoxon rank sum]) and a higher mortality rate (11.3% vs 1.5%, p = 0.001). Angina associated with transient ST-T changes occurred in 70 of the 289 patients in the placebo group but in only 45 of the 287 patients in the diltiazem group--a 28% reduction in cumulative life-table incidence (p = 0.0103 [2-tail, log rank]; 95% confidence interval, 9.3 to 53.8%). It is concluded that patients with early postinfarction angina are at increased risk of reinfarction and death, and angina associated with transient electrocardiographic changes identified a very high risk subset. This subset appeared to have a larger area of viable but jeopardized myocardium and benefited from prophylactic therapy with diltiazem.\r"

Analysis of 28 variables by Cox's regression model for survival revealed an independent effect of the left ventricular (LV) score, the final exercise stage, and treatment received on survival. Seven-year survival rates between medical and surgical therapy were compared among subsets of patients according to the LV function and the results of exercise testing. Among patients with normal LV function, those with at least 1 mm of ischemic ST-segment depression or low exercise capacity had better 7-year survival if treated by surgical rather than medical therapy (p less than 0.05). Survival was not different between the medical and surgical groups in patients without ischemic ST depression or with good exercise capacity. Among patients with impaired LV function, surgery improved survival in most subsets of patients with the exception of patients with a preserved exercise capacity. These results support the use of exercise testing in the risk stratification of patients with 3-vessel CAD.\r"

The clinical efficacy and tolerance of amiodarone were affected by the baseline EF and development of CHF. Efficacy and tolerance was 80% in patients with an EF of more than 30% and 60% in those with an EF of 30% or less.

During the initial dose-ranging phase, 11 patients with qualifying arrhythmias (median VPC frequency 575/hour, range 37 to 1,494) received incremental oral doses of 100, 300 and 500 mg of recainam given every 8 hours, each for 3 days. Efficacy was assessed on the last day of each dose. The 300-mg/day dose of recainam was generally ineffective; the 900-mg/day dose was partially effective (58% median VPC reduction, p = 0.03); and the 1,500-mg/day dose was very effective (79% reduction, p less than 0.003). Median reductions in repetitive beats (beats in couplets and runs) for the 3 doses were 18% (difference not significant), 94% (p less than 0.01), and 98% (p less than 0.004), respectively. Recainam provided individual efficacy (at least 70% VPCs or at least 90% repetitive beat suppression, or both) in 7 (64%) of the patients taking 900 mg/day and in 8 (73%) taking 1,500 mg/day.

For equivalent decreases in mean arterial pressure compared with placebo baseline (approximately 8 mm Hg supine and 12 mm Hg upright), prazosin and captopril did not increase cardiac index or heart rate. In contrast, marked decreases in systemic vascular resistance with pinacidil (approximately 25%, p less than 0.05) were accompanied by reflex increases in cardiac index (approximately 20%, p less than 0.05). Activity of the sympathetic nervous system, measured by supine and upright plasma norepinephrine (NE), increased approximately 50% with pinacidil and prazosin (p less than 0.001 each), whereas captopril decreased supine plasma NE by 12% (p less than 0.05) and did not change upright plasma NE. All 3 drugs caused an expansion of height-adjusted blood volume (approximately 14%). Pinacidil and prazosin caused reversible weight gains of 0.9 and 0.7 kg, respectively, whereas captopril reversibly decreased body weight by 0.8 kg (p less than 0.05), suggesting differential effects of the 3 drugs on interstitial fluid volume. During chronic therapy, all 3 drugs may require concomitant diuretic therapy, whereas concomitant sympatholytic therapy may be required with the potent vasodilator pinacidil. Captopril may be associated with the lowest cardiac risk because of its lack of stimulatory effects on the sympathetic nervous system and cardiac index.\r"

Plasma norepinephrine was elevated in all patients (average 741 +/- 472 micrograms/ml), but myocardial norepinephrine was variable, ranging from 79 to 2,127 ng/g (average 512 +/- 392). Myocardial dopamine also varied considerably (range 0 to 713 ng/g, average 143 +/- 150). Nineteen patients had the expected pattern of low cardiac norepinephrine and elevated dopamine levels. However, myocardial catecholamine levels were normal (high norepinephrine, low dopamine) in 7 patients; both norepinephrine and dopamine were low in 6 patients; and norepinephrine levels were preserved but dopamine high in 7 patients. Cardiac norepinephrine level correlated only weakly with peripheral vascular resistance (r = 0.39, p less than 0.05), and examination of multiple other variables failed to reveal likely causes of the differences in cardiac norepinephrine and dopamine between patients. Thus, myocardial norepinephrine is not uniformly reduced in patients with severe CHF, and further attempts to delineate the factors regulating myocardial catecholamine concentration and adrenergic function in such patients are needed.\r"

Although the variability of oximetric measurements has been established in patients without shunting and a range of normal has been determined for the technique, the variability of the indocyanine green method among persons without shunting has not been clarified; as a result, a range of normal for indocyanine green has not been established. In 66 adult patients in whom hydrogen inhalation (an extremely sensitive technique for detecting even very small intracardiac left-to-right shunts) revealed no shunting, indocyanine green curves were generated by injection into the pulmonary artery as blood was sampled from a systemic artery. In these patients the percentage left-to-right shunt (that is, the percentage of pulmonary blood flow reaching the lungs through an intracardiac shunt) (determined with the equation of Carter et al) ranged from -9% to +26% (+7 +/- 8%, mean +/- standard deviation). There was no definable relation between the percentage left-to-right shunt and the indicator dilution measurement of cardiac output. Thus, these data establish a range of normal for the indocyanine green technique of detecting and measuring intracardiac left-to-right shunting. If this technique is to be used reliably to detect shunting, its results must demonstrate a percentage shunt in excess of +26%.\r"

Limb vascular resistance decreased modestly after enoximone with a significant augmentation (+12% to 17%) of limb blood flow compared with placebo. The initial oral administration of the 1 and 2 mg/kg doses of enoximone improved central hemodynamic parameters with apparent preferential reduction of limb vascular resistance and augmentation of blood flow to the limb region (peripheral musculoskeletal system).\r"

  ".W": "Previous clinical studies with intravenous enoximone have used cumulative dosing to quantify enoximone's hemodynamic effects. The magnitude and duration of the hemodynamic effects of single intravenous doses of enoximone were evaluated in patients with congestive heart failure. Sixty patients, who were in New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV, received single intravenous doses of enoximone, either 0.25 (12 patients), 0.5 (13 patients), 1 (14 patients), 1.5 (10 patients) or 2 mg/kg (11 patients). Cardiac index was increased by 20% with the 0.25 mg/kg dose and by 48% and 42% with the 1.5 and 2 mg/kg doses, respectively. These increases were statistically significant (Student's paired t test with Bonferroni's correction, p less than 0.007) for 1 hour after 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, for 2 hours after 1 mg/kg and for 4 hours after 1.5 and 2 mg/kg. Enoximone also reduced pulmonary artery diastolic pressure by 19% with 0.25 mg/kg and by 29% with 2 mg/kg. The duration of effect varied from 1 hour with 0.25 mg/kg to 4 hours with 2 mg/kg. Enoximone produced no consistent or dose-related effects on heart rate or blood pressure. Eighteen adverse reactions were reported by 15 patients, of which 11 were minor and transient (vein pain, flushes, nausea). In 5 patients ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias were observed, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles; 3 of these patients had evidence of arrhythmias before enoximone. Laboratory studies before and after treatment showed no drug-related effects. Dose-related effects on the magnitude and duration of hemodynamic responses to intravenous enoximone were evident within the dose range of 0.25 to 2 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both schedules produced significant increases in cardiac index (55% and 68%, p less than 0.01 for both) and decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-29% and -42%, p less than 0.01 for both). Similar beneficial effects were observed in systemic vascular resistance (-33% and -44%) and right atrial pressure (-30% and -46%), which also were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Heart rate increased modestly (6% and 13%) and mean systemic arterial pressure decreased (-5% and -14%). Some adverse effect occurred in 20% of the patients. Cardiovascular (10%) and central nervous system (6.7%) were the most frequent side effects. However, a direct relation to enoximone therapy could not be established in this uncontrolled open-label study of acutely ill patients. It is concluded that intravenous enoximone produces beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with severe congestive heart failure with minimal changes in heart rate and blood pressure at cumulative doses less than 3 mg/kg.\r"

  ".W": "To assess their comparative effects on hemodynamics, nitroprusside, dobutamine and enoximone were sequentially administered to 10 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Nitroprusside, dobutamine (at 10 micrograms/kg/min) and enoximone (at 2 mg/kg) increased stroke volume index to a similar extent (31%, 34% and 36%, respectively). Enoximone produced less tachycardia than dobutamine and, consequently, a smaller improvement in cardiac index. Mean arterial pressure was not altered by dobutamine but was reduced 9% by enoximone, 2 mg/kg. This finding accounts for the larger (although not significant) increase in left ventricular stroke work index observed with dobutamine compared with enoximone. Ventricular filling pressures and vascular resistances were significantly decreased by all 3 drugs (p = 0.001). All 3 drugs improved cardiac pump function when assessed by the increase in stroke index to a similar extent; however, enoximone (2 mg/kg) resulted in less hypotension than nitroprusside (mean arterial pressure -9% vs -22%, p = 0.0001) and in less tachycardia than dobutamine 10 micrograms/kg/min. Those differences in mode of action account for the variations observed in the heart rate-blood pressure product (dobutamine 10 micrograms/kg/min, +18%, enoximone 2 mg/kg, -5%, p = 0.003). Enoximone thus appears to be of great value in the management of severe congestive heart failure by its combination of vasodilatory and inotropic properties. Enoximone (2 mg/kg) provides a clinically significant increase in cardiac index, a clear reduction of ventricular filling pressures, a moderate reduction of mean arterial pressure and only minor changes of heart rate and of rate pressure product.\r"

Hemodynamic data were measured before and during the first 24 hours of therapy. An oral dose was given in the first 24 hours, and then every 8 hours. Acute administration of enoximone resulted in significant improvement in cardiac index (2.07 +/- 0.18 to 2.36 +/- 0.16 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.05), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (35 +/- 4 to 30 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.02), mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (22 +/- 3 to 18 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and systemic vascular resistance (1,712 +/- 148 to 1,384 +/- 82 dynes s cm-5, p less than 0.02). Neither hypotension nor tachycardia was observed. Although there was a trend toward a dose-response relation, hemodynamic responses to doses less than 1.5 mg/kg and greater than 1.5 mg/kg were not significantly different. Clinical symptoms improved with long-term therapy, but left ventricular ejection fraction and exercise treadmill time did not change.

Systemic vascular resistance at rest decreased with enoximone (p less than 0.05) and was unchanged with captopril. Systemic vascular resistance at peak exercise was not lowered by either drug. Both drugs caused an increase of cardiac index at peak exercise (p less than 0.04) and a prolongation of exercise time (p less than 0.05).

Associations between hair analyses and demographic variables have been found. Fewer studies have shown a correlation between essential elements in hair of animals and the same elements in organs. It is possible to measure trace elements in hair to satisfy the skeptical chemist. Although such measurement is a necessary prelude toward medical utility, it is not sufficient. Hair analysis seems potentially useful in experimental medicine but its use in clinical medicine for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy will remain limited until validation by the standard methods of clinical investigation is achieved.\r"

Changes in BCAAs were normal in GDM women. P women had greater rises of insulin in response to both test meals than did NP women. This may facilitate increased BCAA uptake from the circulation.

The postprandial glucose and insulin response may indicate a mackerel-oil-induced resistance of insulin receptors. Although the polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of cardiac sarcolemma widely differed between the two groups, all determined indices of heart function were equal.

In contrast, data on the influence of iron deficiency on immune function are often perceived as being confusing and contradictory. From reexamination of relevant literature, it seems safe to conclude that abnormalities in cell-mediated immunity and ability of neutrophils to kill several types of bacteria are well established under experimental conditions in iron-deficient patients. It remains uncertain whether these abnormalities result in an increased incidence and duration of infections. This area still requires careful study.\r"

Morphometric analysis showed little difference in villous height but a significant decrease in mitotic index of the crypt epithelial cells in the iron-deficient group. Direct immunoperoxidase studies showed that iron-deficient rats had substantially fewer sIgA- and IgM-containing cells than iron-sufficient rats. This abnormality was reversed after a 1-wk iron-sufficient diet. We conclude that iron deficiency may impair local immunity in the intestinal mucosa, sensitizing the surface epithelial cells to damage by noxious agents. Similar changes might lead to the syndrome of iron-deficiency anemia and hypoproteinemia in children.\r"

To assess the efficacy of ABPAP in the detection of cellular antigens and to compare its utility with that of protease digestion technics, the authors studied cytokeratin (CK) reactivity in six examples each of colon, prostate, and breast cancer and Leu-M1 reactivity in five ductal breast carcinomas. ABC, PAP and ABPAP were applied to these cases alone and in combination with prior pepsin digestion of deparaffinized sections. With respect to the number of cells that stained and their intensity in each case, there was significant enhancement of CK and Leu-M1 reactivity with ABPAP, as compared with ABC and PAP when pepsin digestion was not employed. Further, ABPAP provided undigested CK staining results comparable to those seen with the use of ABC or PAP with pepsin digestion. Protease treatment was uniformly detrimental to the visualization of Leu-M1, regardless of the method employed. In summary, ABPAP was clearly superior to ABC and PAP in all settings analyzed. It may prove to be useful adjunct in the immunohistochemical visualization of tissue antigens, when more routine technics yield suboptimal results.\r"

As cost-containment becomes an increasingly important pressure in clinical laboratory management, the value of each laboratory performing its own quality assurance testing of media has been challenged if the media are purchased from a manufacturer who is required to perform quality assurance testing. In the past ten years of using commercially prepared media from eight different national and regional suppliers, the authors have encountered an average of six types (15 shipments) of media each year that failed to meet their laboratory's performance criteria, which reinforces the need for clinical laboratories to continue their own performance testing of media manufactured commercially, particularly when the media are used for primary isolation. Quality control testing of media can be performed most cost-effectively by purchasing in the largest lots and shipments that shelf life and storage requirements allow, streamlining test procedures while keeping detailed records of performance characteristics, and purchasing media from firms that have demonstrated competence and integrity.\r"

The total time required is approximately 16 weeks. The finished plastinated specimen is dry to the touch, odorless, and nontoxic, yet it maintains its original shape and, in many cases, is reasonably close in color and consistency. It resists deterioration and can be stored at room temperature indefinitely. The authors have found plastinated specimens to be superior to those preserved in formalin for teaching anatomic pathology to undergraduate medical students.\r"

Reflux was found in 79% of children who had the nonantireflux procedure vs 19% of children who had the antireflux procedure. This disparity was present regardless of sex and age. Infections occurred at a rate of one per 11 patient-months after the nonantireflux procedure vs one per 40 patient-months after the antireflux procedure. Regardless of surgical technique, the incidence of infection was higher in children with reflux. The potentially harmful effect of infection with reflux warrants concern. Because of the need to maximize allograft function for a longer time period, an antireflux procedure is recommended in all pediatric kidney transplants.\r"

Seven of 65 (11%) had a significant renal lesion that included conjoined kidneys in a female with Fanconi's anemia. Four of these patients did not have signs or symptoms suggestive of an underlying urinary tract pathologic condition. These results indicate that an SNN/renal field defect probably exists, although the significance of this association is significantly weaker than that originally proposed by Mehes. One variable influencing this association appears to be racial differences, as evidenced by the absence of renal defects in blacks with an SNN. Based on our findings, the identification of additional minor phenotypic abnormalities may represent an additional mediating variable in this association. However, the discovery of an SNN in an otherwise normal individual, or an individual with a recognizable pattern of human malformation not associated with renal anomalies or central nervous system dysfunction alone, does not appear to be an indication for additional diagnostic studies of the urinary tract.\r"

  ".U": "87296008\r", 
  ".W": "Wilms tumor, a common childhood renal tumor, occurs in both a heritable and a nonheritable form. The heritable form may occasionally be attributed to a chromosome deletion at 11p13, and tumors from patients with normal constitutional chromosomes often show deletion or rearrangement of 11p13. It has been suggested that a germinal or somatic mutation may occur on one chromosome 11 and predispose to Wilms tumor and that a subsequent somatic genetic event on the normal homologue at 11p13 may permit tumor development. To study the frequency and mechanism of such tumor-specific genetic events, we have examined the karyotype and chromosome 11 genotype of normal and tumor tissues from 13 childhood renal tumor patients with different histologic tumor types and associated clinical conditions. Tumors of eight of the 12 Wilms tumor patients, including all viable tumors examined directly, show molecular evidence of loss of 11p DNA sequences by somatic recombination (four cases), chromosome loss (two cases), and recombination (two cases) or chromosome loss and duplication. One malignant rhabdoid tumor in a patient heterozygous for multiple 11p markers did not show any tumor-specific 11p alteration. These findings confirm the critical role of 11p sequences in Wilms tumor development and reveal that mitotic recombination may be the most frequent mechanism by which tumors develop.\r"

Ninety-seven patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and a serious cytomegalovirus infection received ganciclovir, 3.0 to 15 mg/kg per day. Viremia cleared during drug therapy in 88 percent of patients. Viral shedding from urine and throat ceased or became inapparent during treatment in 78 percent and 68 percent of patients, respectively. Among patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis, 87 percent of evaluable patients had improvement in (30 of 60) or stabilization (22 of 60) of their disease. However, when the drug was discontinued, progression or recurrence of disease always occurred. Long-term suppressive therapy with ganciclovir, 5.0 mg/kg five to seven times weekly, prevented the recurrence of cytomegalovirus disease (p less than 0.001). The drug was eliminated by renal excretion, and in patients without renal impairment (creatinine clearance rates of more than 60 ml/minute/1.73 m2), ganciclovir has a mean half-life of 4.2 hours. Significant neutropenia and leukopenia occurred in 55 percent and 32 percent of patients, respectively.\r"

All centers used a microdilution test method that defined the recognized important test variables, including inoculum size, culture medium, dilution technique, incubation time, method of subculture, and bactericidal endpoint. In patients with acute osteomyelitis, peak serum bactericidal titers had no predictive value; however, trough titers of 1:2 or greater accurately predicted cure, whereas trough titers of less than 1:2 predicted therapeutic failure. In patients with chronic osteomyelitis, peak serum bactericidal titers of 1:16 or greater and trough titers of 1:4 or greater accurately predicted cure, whereas peak titers of less than 1:16 and trough titers of less than 1:2 accurately predicted failure. It is concluded that this standardized serum bactericidal test provides good prognostic information in patients with osteomyelitis, and it is recommended that patients with acute osteomyelitis have serum bactericidal titers of 1:2 or greater at all times and that patients with chronic osteomyelitis have serum bactericidal titers of 1:4 or greater at all times.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 205 patients with mild to moderate essential uncomplicated hypertension was chosen from 3,183 hypertensive patients referred to a hypertension clinic for the first time, and was asked to participate in a six-month double-blind parallel trial. A single physician was in charge of all the patients. After a two-week single-blind placebo period, the patients were randomly assigned to regimens of either enalapril (20 mg per day) or placebo. Both groups were then followed up every two weeks, and increasing doses of hydrochlorothiazide (25 and 50 mg), oxprenolol (160 and 320 mg), and dihydralazine (50 and 100 mg) were added until the diastolic blood pressure was lower than 90 mm Hg. After a six-month follow-up, the enalapril group showed lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures than the control group (129/82 +/- 12/6 mg Hg versus 135/86 +/- 10/5 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). The number of daily tablets of active drugs was 2.7 +/- 1.8 in the enalapril group and 4.4 +/- 2.4 in the control group (p less than 0.01). The mean plasma potassium level was 4.16 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter in the enalapril group versus 3.92 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter in the control group (p less than 0.001), despite more frequent use of amiloride (p less than 0.001). This difference is explained by the lower dose of hydrochlorothiazide used in the enalapril group by comparison to the control group, and a lower excretion of urinary aldosterone in the enalapril group than in the control group (11.6 +/- 7.4 versus 19.8 +/- 11.8 micrograms per 24 hours, p less than 0.001). Drug withdrawal was necessary in eight patients in the enalapril group and in 16 patients in the control group (p less than 0.05). These results show that first-step treatment of mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension with enalapril permits better blood pressure control than the standard treatment, requires fewer tablets to be taken daily, and involves a smaller risk of hypokalemia.\r"

  ".W": "A multicenter prospective randomized trial of four versus six weeks of amphotericin B, 0.3 mg/kg per day, plus flucytosine, 150 mg/kg per day, was performed with 194 patients with cryptococcal meningitis. One or more toxic drug reactions developed in 103 patients: azotemia (51), renal tubular acidosis (two), leukopenia (30), thrombocytopenia (22), diarrhea (26), nausea/vomiting (10), and hepatitis (13). The four- and six-week regimens were complicated by toxicity in 44 percent and 43 percent of cases, respectively. Toxicity appeared during the first two weeks of therapy in 56 percent and during the first four weeks in 87 percent. Azotemia did not occur more frequently in renal transplant recipients or diabetic patients. Cytopenias did not appear more often in patients with hematologic malignancies or those receiving immunosuppressive therapies. Toxic reactions that contributed to death developed in five patients (two with azotemia, one with pancytopenia, one with hepatitis, one with ileus). Amphotericin B-induced azotemia was not a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of bone marrow, gastrointestinal, or hepatic toxicity attributable to flucytosine. Flucytosine toxicity was associated with peak serum flucytosine levels of 100 micrograms/ml or more during two or more weeks of therapy (p = 0.005). Peak 5-fluorouracil levels were not predictive of toxicity. An initial dose of flucytosine is recommended based on the creatinine clearance: 150 mg/kg per day at a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/minute, 75 mg/kg per day at a creatinine clearance of 26 to 50 ml/minute, and 37 mg/kg per day at a creatinine clearance of 13 to 25 ml/minute. The serum creatinine level should be monitored twice weekly and the creatinine clearance weekly during therapy in order to anticipate changes in serum flucytosine concentration. In addition, it is recommended that the serum flucytosine level be determined two hours after an oral dose once a week, and that the dose be adjusted to maintain a level of 50 to 100 micrograms/ml.\r"

  ".W": "Described herein is a case of oncogenic osteomalacia that ran a course of at least 16 years before curative resection of a mixed mesenchymal tumor. Hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism developed in the patient, and review of the literature indicated that this occurs in about 10 percent of reported cases. Changes in serum parathyroid hormone levels with and without phosphate supplement therapy and before and after tumor resection suggested that both the high intake of phosphate and the effect of the neoplasm on vitamin D bioactivation engendered the parathyroid overactivity. Despite marked hyperparathyroidism, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were subnormal preoperatively but showed a sevenfold increase within 48 hours of tumor resection. Thereafter, a gradual increase in the maximal tubular reabsorption of phosphate occurred during several months. Biopsy of the iliac crest confirmed that tumor removal was followed by resolution of osteomalacia, but there was no accompanying increase in vertebral mineral density as assessed by quantitative computed tomography or in total-body bone mineral as measured with dual-photon absorptiometry. The findings presented are consistent with secretion by the tumor of a factor with a short half-life that is potent enough to inhibit renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha-hydroxylase despite hyperparathyroidism. The resulting subnormal circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels may have secondarily contributed to decreased renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate.\r"

However, recent studies suggest that infants exposed to the small amounts of antithyroid drugs in breast milk experience no change in thyroid function. Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice in this situation, since it does not cross membranes readily, and milk concentrations are therefore quite low. However, methimazole in low dosages might be used if the infant's thyroid status was monitored at frequent intervals.\r"

Detection of fluorescent antibody to varicella zoster virus membrane antigen is an available means for identifying women exposed to varicella who are at risk for infection. During a 5 1/2-year period, 37 pregnant women who had been exposed to varicella and who had a negative or indeterminate history of prior varicella were tested for the presence of varicella zoster virus membrane antigen. Among the 17 women with a negative history, 12 (71%) had a positive test result and five (29%) had a negative test result. Among 20 women with undeterminant histories, 18 (90%) were immune and two (10%) were susceptible. Three additional women who were tested despite a history of varicella had positive varicella zoster virus membrane antigen test results. Overall, 81% of patients with a negative or uncertain history of varicella had serologic evidence of past varicella. One of six untreated seronegative women and one weakly positive woman developed disease. There was no instance of congenital varicella. Expeditious determination of varicella zoster virus membrane antigen or equivalent anti-varicella antibody status in pregnant women exposed to varicella appears to be a rapid, satisfactory method for determining who should promptly receive varicella zoster immunoglobulin passive immunization.\r"

No placental abnormalities were noted on ultrasound and only one placenta demonstrated hydropic change (15% to 20% of villi) on pathologic examination. Since the nonmolar triploid fetus often presents with unexplained intrauterine growth retardation, identification of its characteristic sonographic features allows for karyotype confirmation and the avoidance of inappropriate obstetric management.\r"

After delivery, fibronectin decreased only in preeclamptic patients (p less than 0.005); alpha 2-antiplasmin increased in all groups (p less than 0.001). Endothelial injury in preeclampsia appeared to resolve soon after delivery, which could contribute to the rapid clinical improvement noted in the early puerperium.\r"

Four patients electively had their pregnancies terminated. One patient was delivered at term of a healthy, growth retarded male infant who on follow-up at age 17 months was developmentally normal. Only three cases were associated with a fetal defect. Patients should be counseled that, even in the absence of a demonstrable cause for diminished amniotic fluid on ultrasonography, raised maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels coupled with oligohydramnios seem to carry a poor prognosis.\r"

We measured total, active, and inactive (pro-) renin in maternal serum, fetal arterial and venous blood, and chorion homogenate in eight normotensive term patients and 18 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. No differences in active or prorenin were found in maternal blood from normal women or patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. In contrast, fetal artery and vein, as well as chorionic tissue, contained significantly higher active renin in pregnancy-induced hypertension compared with normal subjects. No difference in fetal or chorionic prorenin was seen in the two groups. Thus active to total renin ratio was higher in the fetus and chorion of subjects with pregnancy-induced hypertension, which suggests enhanced active renin production. These results suggest that pregnancy-induced hypertension is associated with increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system in the fetoplacental unit, which is not reflected in the maternal circulation. This may be an attempt by the fetus and chorionic membranes to maintain vascular homeostasis in the face of altered uteroplacental blood flow.\r"

Tocolysis was discontinued or not instituted after 31 weeks of gestation. Seventy-nine patients were randomized over a 4-year period, 39 in the tocolysis group and 40 in the expectant group. Twenty-three patients in the tocolysis group actually received ritodrine. No difference between the two groups was demonstrated in the interval between premature rupture of membranes and delivery or in reaching 32 weeks of gestation. No statistical difference was seen in maternal morbidity. Birth weights and gestational ages at delivery were similar between the two groups as were the incidences of neonatal morbidities caused by prematurity and infection and in the duration of neonatal hospital stays. Despite being conducted in those gestational ages in which prolongation of pregnancy might be expected to be of most benefit, no difference could be demonstrated with the addition of tocolytic therapy over expectant management alone.\r"

With the criteria of intracytoplasmic coccoid inclusion bodies within metaplastic cells, 45 (34%) of 130 Papanicolaou smears were read as suggestive for C. trachomatis. Seventeen of the 45 positive Papanicolaou smears were positive on culture and 28 were negative (sensitivity 54%, specificity 71%). In contrast, 48 of 51 women with positive cultures and one woman with a negative culture had positive immunofluorescent-stained cytologic smears (sensitivity 94%, specificity 99%, with positive predictive value of 98%). Similarly, 47 of 51 women with positive cultures also had positive results with MicroTrak direct immunofluorescent stain, with only one positive specimen in 196 women with negative cultures (sensitivity 92%, specificity 99%, with positive predictive value of 98%). This study demonstrates that immunofluorescent staining of cervical specimens or of cytologic smears is a more sensitive and specific method than routine Papanicolaou smear for detection of chlamydia infection in a high-prevalence population.\r"

In the present study, 1040 pregnant women underwent ultrasonic examination between 24 and 41 weeks of gestation, and the in utero ponderal index was determined by dividing the estimated fetal weight by the third power of the femur length, rendering a relatively constant value of 8.345 +/- 2.5 (2 SD). Fifty-one cases were defined as intrauterine growth retardation due to an estimated fetal weight lower than the tenth percentile for gestational age. The in utero ponderal index proved to be a valuable index in the prediction of fetal outcome in those cases of intrauterine growth retardation in which the in utero ponderal index was smaller than 1 SD from the average of 8.345. Fetal and neonatal well-being was clearly compromised when intrauterine growth retardation was associated with a low in utero ponderal index.\r"

The time of ovulation in streptokinase- and human chorionic gonadotropin--treated ovaries was similar, but significantly more ova from streptokinase-treated ovaries were immature (p less than 0.001). Other ovaries were pretreated with trans-4-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane-carboxylic acid, an inhibitor of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and then perfused with human chorionic gonadotropin (50 IU). Ovulatory efficiency was significantly reduced by trans-4-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane-carboxylic acid at 10 or 1 mmol/L (p less than 0.001), but ovum maturity was unaffected. Aprotinin (100 or 10 micrograms/ml), a potent inhibitor of plasmin, significantly inhibited human chorionic gonadotropin-induced ovulation (p less than 0.001) but did not affect oocyte maturation. Scanning electron microscopy of detergent-treated streptokinase-perfused ovaries revealed loosening and decomposition of collagen in the tunica albuginea. These results suggest proteolytic enzyme involvement in follicle rupture.\r"

This review presents current experimental evidence demonstrating that the effects of chemical exposure on blastocyst stage embryos may be manifest long after the time of insult and that subtle nonlethal mutations may have a role in poor fetal performance after early chemical exposures.\r"

Accurate identification of these bacteria is difficult because cultures obtained via the lower tract can easily be contaminated. Although use of a double-lumen catheter-protected brush culture cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, it is the least invasive method for obtaining culture material from the upper reproductive tract. Compounding the problem of accurately identifying pathogens that cause acute upper tract infections is the fact that bacteria appear to be present in the upper tracts of asymptomatic women with normal examinations. Because of these problems and because of the polymicrobial nature of these infections, empiric therapy frequently includes more than one antimicrobial agent. Newer, semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins have expanded spectrums of in vitro activity against most of the bacteria frequently recovered from pelvic infection sites. Comparative clinical trials have shown these agents to be as effective when used alone as is combination therapy. With few exceptions, empiric monotherapy with one of these newer antimicrobials will be curative for women with acute upper tract infection, will have less potential toxicity, will require less space, materials, and manpower to administer, and will be less expensive.\r"

Pharmacokinetics and spectrum of antibacterial activity, although variables of paramount importance in predicting success in the treatment of established infections, were discovered to have questionable impact on prophylactic efficacy. Duration of antimicrobial administration has gradually diminished from the total length of hospital stay to a single preoperative dose without increased risk of infection; efficacy may be related to route of administration.

After informed consent was obtained, patients received either 4 gm of piperacillin intravenously as a single dose or three 2 gm doses of piperacillin intravenously 4 hours apart. One hundred sixteen patients were evaluated for response; postoperative infection at the operative site was prevented in 52/60 (86.6%) who received the single dose and 53/56 (94.6%) who received multiple doses. The types of postoperative infections that occurred were similar in those patients in each group who developed infection and all responded well to therapeutic drugs. No adverse reactions to piperacillin were noted. Demographic characteristics and risk factors for infection were comparable for the two groups. These data support the efficacy of single-dose prophylaxis with an appropriate antibiotic agent.\r"

Immunohistochemical investigations, aimed at characterizing basement membrane (BM) behavior in the two types of BAC, revealed different distribution patterns. The first (Type I BAC) showed a linear staining for laminin and Type IV collagen similar to normal lung. Fibronectin was widely present in the septal interstitium and patchily distributed along the BM. The second (Type II BAC) showed a variable reaction for Type IV collagen and fibronectin, whereas laminin was absent or appeared as short, interrupted tracts around the epithelial neoplastic population, similar to conventional adenocarcinoma of the lung. These results suggest that only Type I BAC shows structural characteristics different from those of conventional adenocarcinoma of the lung.\r"

Regardless of the degree of fibrosis or inflammation, serum levels of the aminopropeptide of Type I remained within normal limits. In contrast, serum levels of the aminopropeptide of Type III procollagen were elevated uniformly. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the aminopropeptide of Type III procollagen persists extracellularly. This finding may explain the previously reported relationship between levels of inflammation and serum levels of the Type III aminopropeptide.\r"

  ".U": "87296235\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate epithelial-stromal interactions in bladder carcinogenesis, the authors developed an experimental model using a heterotopically transplanted rat urinary bladder (HTB). A rat urinary bladder which was completely denuded of epithelial cells ex vivo with hypotonic shock and a nonionic detergent was transplanted into a syngeneic recipient. No reepithelialization occurred during the 8-week posttransplant period. The basal lamina remained intact throughout this period and showed linear immunofluorescence with antibodies against laminin, Type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate-proteoglycan. When 1 X 10(5) to 5 X 10(5) dispersed normal urothelial cells were delivered into the HTB through an attached reservoir 4 days after transplantation, complete resurfacing by inoculated cells occurred within a few days. A transient hyperplasia was followed by a normal 2-3-cell-thick urothelial organization in 4 weeks. Cultured bladder carcinoma cells also resurfaced the denuded bladder basal lamina; the progressive growth of this neoplastic epithelium resulted in carcinoma in situ as well as foci of invasive carcinoma within 4 weeks following inoculation. This in vivo system has an advantage over other in vivo and in vitro models in that complete removal of epithelial cells can be achieved easily and completely; the course after reepithelialization can be modified by subsequent treatment, progression of neoplastic development can be closely observed by a change in the color of the aspirate, its cytology, and biochemical analysis of secretions; and an adequate amount of tissue can be available for subsequent examinations. The model is potentially useful not only for studying epithelial-stromal interactions during carcinogenesis, but also for examining the mechanisms of tumor invasion and metastasis.\r"

Ten human cadavers were used in this study. Six different types of grafts were studied. The tendon grafts were removed from each cadaver and fixed to femurs and tibias as ACL substitutes with different surgical fixation methods, leaving femur-reconstructed graft-tibia preparations. The surgical techniques used were staple fixation, tying sutures over buttons, and screw fixation. In the latter, the screws were introduced through femoral and tibial drill holes from the outside in order to achieve interference fit as described by Lambert. Tensile testing demonstrated that the original ACL is significantly stronger than the graft used for reconstruction in linear load, stiffness, and maximum tensile strength. All of the failures of the reconstructed ACL grafts occurred at the fixation site, indicating that the mechanically weak link of the reconstructed graft is located at the fixation site. Among the different methods of fixation, one-third of the patellar tendon secured with a cancellous screw, especially with a custom designed large diameter screw, showed significantly higher values. Although many other factors affect the success of ACL reconstruction, our study indicates that the method of surgical fixation is the major factor influencing the graft's mechanical properties in the immediate postoperative period.\r"

  ".W": "High-frequency ventilation has been used successfully to manage life-threatening complications in premature infants with lung disease. Here we report a preliminary assessment of the efficacy and safety of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation-(HFO-A, A = active expiratory phase) when used as a primary ventilator in 11 infants of 24-34 weeks gestation who required ventilatory support. HFO-A was initiated after no more than 5.5 hr of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). HFO-A at 15 Hz was used for 12-203 hr following a protocol designed for rapid reduction of FI02 requirements. CO2 elimination was easily achieved in all infants. Oxygenation was satisfactory, except in one infant with congenital pneumonia. There were four deaths during HFO-A: two pulmonary (one congenital pneumonia; one pulmonary hemorrhage) and two nonpulmonary. The HFO-A protocol utilized lung volume recruitment maneuvers plus mean airway pressures (MAwP) greater than those generally used early in the course of CMV. Therefore, in a subset of infants less than or equal to 29 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), ventilator pressures and gas exchange were compared in infants treated with either HFO-A or CMV. Maximum MAwP levels were reached earlier in six infants on HFO-A (5.2 +/- 2.5 hr; mean +/- SD) than in a comparable group of 9 CMV-treated infants (36 +/- 1 hr). This earlier use of high MAwP lowered the FI02 to less than 0.4 by 18.9 +/- 11 hr with HFO-A as compared with 64 +/- 6 hr using CMV, without any evidence of an increase in pulmonary complications. There were 17 complications in the nine CMV-treated infants; and four in the six HFO-A treated ones. We conclude that HFO-A, instituted early and used with a protocol designed for early reduction in FI02 requirements, demonstrates sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant further clinical trials in the routine management of infant RDS.\r"

After the initial comparison, patients were randomized to HFJV or CV, unless one mode of ventilation was clearly superior based on preestablished criteria. In six of the seven patients, oxygenation deteriorated after the switch from CV to HFJV. The ratio of PaCO2 to FI02 declined from 227 +/- 167 to 133 +/- 100 (mean +/- SD, P less than 0.05), and the PaCO2 increased from 47 +/- 13 to 56 +/- 18 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). The mean chest tube leak did not change significantly. Randomization of the mode of ventilation was not performed in any patient because CV was superior by a priori criteria. We conclude that when acute respiratory failure is complicated by a bronchopleural fistula, HFJV with mean airway pressures comparable to those provided during conventional ventilation does not provide satisfactory gas exchange.\r"

Furthermore, the time to Csmax was significantly faster in elderly patients (P less than 0.00001).

  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrated a high incidence of local thrombosis in patients in whom external arteriovenous shunts were used for vascular access. This procedure provides, therefore, a useful model for the evaluation of potential antithrombotic agents. The effect of the hemorheologically and hemostasiologically active drug Pentoxifylline on the incidence of thrombosis of arteriovenous shunts (Ramires shunt) was investigated in a long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 51 patients on chronic hemodialysis. The two treatment groups were comparable in age, sex, concomitant medication, and dialysis program (three times per week for four hours). Drugs known to affect platelet function or coagulation were excluded, with the exception of heparin, during the dialysis procedure. All shunts were placed in the forearm and inserted into the distal part of the radial artery and basilic antebrachial vein. Simultaneously, for medical reasons, in all patients an arteriovenous fistula was performed (proximal part of radial artery and cephalic antebrachial vein). Shunt thrombosis was assumed when the flow in the shunt discontinued under visual and auscultatory control. Thrombi were documented by physical removal from the arterial part of the shunt by use of gentle suction or by complete shunt thrombosis (both arterial and venous part of the shunt). Thereafter, the patients' trial period terminated. The total number of thrombi during the observation period was 44 in the pentoxifylline group (26 patients), compared with 82 in the placebo group (25 patients). The mean number of thrombi per patient was 1.69 +/- 1.29 in the pentoxifylline group, significantly lower than that in the placebo group (3.28 +/- 1.99/p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were given either oral clonidine (400 micrograms/day) or matching placebo for twelve weeks and then tapered off medication over a two-week period. Results are summarized as follows: Profiles over time between groups were significantly different for resting heart rate (p = 0.0005), were different for arterial pressure (p = 0.04), were different for left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.006), and were different for mean accumulated workload (p = 0.076). Exercise double product at 25 watts changed little in three patients and showed a decrease in 2 patients following six weeks of oral clonidine; after twelve weeks, it decreased in three patients, increased in 1, and changed little in another. After washout, double product returned toward baseline values. In the placebo groups, double product showed little change. Resting of the heart by decreasing heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, and venous tone are thought by the authors to be major contributing factors to the observed beneficial effect of chronic oral clonidine in chronic heart failure.\r"

Tests must be well controlled so the responses can be differentiated from nonspecific (nonallergic) effects. There is probably very limited routine clinical usefulness for allergen inhalation tests. These tests, however, remain valuable for investigations into the pathogenesis of asthma and for studies on new therapeutic agents. Occupational challenge tests may be used for the diagnosis of occupational asthma, although safer more convenient methodologies may become available in the future. Occupational challenges, however, remain the only way to definitively document sensitivity to certain low molecular weight chemicals that cause occupational asthma by a process of sensitization but in which the immunopathogenesis has not been entirely worked out.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic asbestos exposure is associated with the accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes in the lower respiratory tract. This process can be both protective and injurious, since macrophages can aid in asbestos clearance yet also modulate structural derangements of the alveolar walls. To understand why macrophages accumulate in the lungs of asbestos-exposed persons, 2 possible mechanisms were evaluated using alveolar macrophages from subjects with histories of chronic high exposure to airborne asbestos: enhanced recruitment of blood monocytes to the lung, and an increased rate of replication of macrophages in situ. Monoclonal antibody analysis with antibodies that detect surface antigens on the majority of circulating blood monocytes but only on a minority of mature alveolar macrophages demonstrated that an increased proportion of alveolar macrophages of asbestos workers expressed monocyte lineage antigens, suggesting the presence of \"young\" newly recruited macrophages and thus enhanced recruitment. Culture of the alveolar macrophages from these subjects with [3H]thymidine followed by autoradiography demonstrated an increased proportion of alveolar macrophages synthesizing DNA, suggesting the macrophages are replicating at an increased rate in situ. These observations are consistent with the concept that both enhanced recruitment of blood monocytes and increased local proliferation of alveolar macrophages contribute to the accumulation mononuclear phagocytes in the lung of persons with chronic asbestos exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Asthma is associated with increased airway responsiveness to pharmacologic agents such as methacholine. Increases in airway responsiveness after exposure to allergen or ozone are associated with increased inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage both in human and in animal studies. We studied the total and differential cell counts in 10 stable atopic asthmatics who had airway hyperresponsiveness but no clinical features of airway inflammation and 10 nonasthmatic subjects, using a conventional 100-ml lavage and a 20-ml washing. Metachromatic cell numbers and eosinophils were increased in both the lavage (p less than 0.01 for metachromatic cells; p = 0.05 for eosinophils) and washing (p less than 0.025 for metachromatic cells and p = 0.03 for eosinophils) compared with those in nonasthmatics. In asthmatics, metachromatic cell numbers in the lavage and washing, and total cell count and, to a lesser extent, eosinophils in lavage were significantly correlated with measurements of airway responsiveness. Major basic protein in lavage and blood did not differ between asthmatics and nonasthmatics. The washing, although it revealed a different cell profile from the lavage in both normal subjects and asthmatics, did not show differences between asthmatics and nonasthmatics undetected by the lavage specimen. We conclude that there is evidence of cellular inflammation in the airway of stable asthmatics and that small volume washings do not add to the information concerning the cell profile of asthmatics and nonasthmatics provided by conventional lavage.\r"

We know now that it is a dynamic system with many parts, and that the reserves of these are normally not large and are recycled. We believe that tight metabolic control must exist to maintain these reserves, and we already have experimental techniques to raise or lower the reserves. Heroic methods of surfactant substitution are now being tested in patients whose deficiency or risk thereof is sufficiently desperate, and the results of these clinical trials, if they are carefully documented with lung function data, will add a new dimension to our knowledge of surfactant dynamics. We may expect in the future that more subtle alterations in surfactant function will become detectable and more sophisticated methods to manipulate the system will be invented. Essential to these will be a deeper understanding of surfactant forms, pathways, kinetics, and controls. Fortunately, research on surfactant structure, metabolism, and turnover intrigues many investigators. They, we may hope, will soon provide the necessary information.\r"

Study Design: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with 6-month treatment and an 18-month follow-up. Setting: Referral-based liver-disease clinics at three university medical centers. Patients: Twenty-five patients with chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis and 39 with chronic persistent hepatitis. Interventions: Thirteen patients received intramuscular Ara-AMP, 2.5 mg/kg body weight, twice daily, alternated monthly for 6 months with subcutaneous human leukocyte interferon, 5 million units, twice daily. Painful paresthesia of the legs necessitated dosage reduction and early discontinuation of enrollment. Twenty-four patients received intramuscular Ara-AMP, 2.5 mg/kg, twice daily, alternated monthly for 6 months with a matching placebo given subcutaneously twice daily. Twenty-seven patients received placebo by intramuscular and subcutaneous injections twice daily for 6 months. Measurements and Main Results: Of the 64 patients, 95% had symptomatic and virologic data available and 64% had biopsies at 12 months; at 24 months, 77% had data available and 56% had repeat biopsies. The highest dropout rate was seen in the group receiving Ara-AMP. The group receiving the placebo was less symptomatic (Karnofsky score of 96% compared with 91% in the group receiving Ara-AMP/placebo and 92% in the group receiving Ara-AMP/human leukocyte interferon, p = 0.02) at 12 but not at 24 months. Loss of DNA polymerase, the hepatitis B e antigen, and the serum hepatitis B virus DNA was similar in all three groups. Histologically, erosion of the limiting plate and lobular activity favored Ara-AMP at 12 but not at 24 months and these differences did not result in differences in the histologic diagnosis. Conclusion: These results do not support the use of Ara-AMP and human leukocyte interferon in chronic persistent or chronic active hepatitis B.\r"

Core antigen was detected in whole plasma from 41% of symptomatic subjects and 13% of asymptomatic subjects seropositive for HIV. After plasma fractionation, antigenemia was found in 60% of symptomatic subjects and in 33% of asymptomatic subjects seropositive for HIV. Fifty-seven percent of samples from which HIV could be isolated in lymphocyte culture had detectable quantities of core antigen in plasma. However, at least 87% of samples with measurable antigen in plasma had HIV isolated from lymphocyte cultures. Antigenemia was associated with reduced T-cell number and symptomatic disease, and may be a useful marker for disease progression.\r"

With respect to long-term benefit, improvement usually occurs within 1 month, reaching a maximum at 6 and then leveling off for the duration of treatment; in some patients, the benefit may wane after an initial satisfactory response in the first 4 to 6 months. In one third of those given methotrexate, treatment had to be discontinued because of adverse effects, less than 1% of which were life threatening. Careful baseline and follow-up monitoring is recommended until more data on the safety of methotrexate are available.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous immunoglobulins are stable monomeric pooled human IgG preparations for therapeutic use. Three intravenous immunoglobulins licensed in the United States are generally therapeutically equivalent. Intravenous immunoglobulin is the preferred agent for replacement therapy for most patients with primary or secondary antibody immunodeficiency because of the rapidity and ease of giving large quantities of IgG, even by self-administration. Disadvantages of intravenous immunoglobulins include frequent (approximately 10%) but usually not serious side effects, the need for venous access (often difficult in infants and young children), and high cost. Intravenous immunoglobulins are also beneficial in the prevention of certain viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus pneumonia and varicella; they may also have a synergistic effect with antibiotics in certain bacterial diseases. Intravenous immunoglobulin has also been used successfully in the management of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, Kawasaki disease, and certain autoimmune diseases. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also be of use in certain high-risk and premature newborns.\r"

  ".W": "Subacute encephalitis caused by infection of the central nervous system by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the most frequent cause of neurologic dysfunction in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This disorder results in progressive cognitive, motor, and behavioral abnormalities in at least two thirds of patients with AIDS. Pathologic evidence of subacute encephalitis is found in 90% of these patients at autopsy. Human immunodeficiency virus is also the etiologic agent of aseptic meningitis, a disease that can occur at the time of seroconversion. Other neurologic disorders frequently associated with HIV include peripheral neuropathies and vacuolar myelopathy. Thus, HIV is neurotropic and may enter the central nervous system early in the course of infection. Neurologic disease may be the only clinical manifestation of HIV infection. Although mechanisms of pathogenesis are unclear, cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage may be important in viral spread to and within the central nervous system. Effective antiviral therapy will probably require penetration of drugs across the blood-brain barrier.\r"

Kanamycin sulfate had passed through the capillaries in the subepithelial layer and reached the epithelial layer as early as 1 minute after injection. The amount of KM in the epithelial layer gradually increased with time (until 30 minutes after injection). The KM also accumulated in floating cells in the ES. These results tend to indicate that the ES is rather easily permeable to systemically administered drugs, which readily get into the regional endolymph. In conclusion, much more attention should be paid to the ES and drug ototoxicity associated with drug therapy in the management of patients with inner ear disturbances.\r"

Secretory IgA and serum type IgA of 165 samples of nasal secretions were analyzed quantitatively by use of electroimmunodiffusion techniques, and the specific antibody activity of secretory IgA against the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes was investigated by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results show that although the secretory IgA content in nasal secretions was elevated in chronic sinusitis, its specific antibody activity against the M protein was lower than that in normal subjects. This evidence suggests that nonspecific secretory IgA antibodies are predominantly produced in chronic sinusitis, and that mucosal immunity preventing the adherence of bacteria is impaired in the diseased mucosa.\r"

Cefmenoxime showed growth-inhibitory activity against Proteus vulgaris at low concentrations but not at high concentrations up to a certain limit. This paradoxical antibacterial activity was not observed with cefoperazone and cefbuperazone. The induction of beta-lactamase by cefmenoxime and the rate of hydrolysis of cefmenoxime in the culture broth were proportional to the initial concentration of this antibiotic. At high initial concentrations, cefmenoxime was rapidly inactivated. On the other hand, neither cefoperazone nor cefbuperazone was inactivated irrespective of concentration. We conclude that cefmenoxime induces beta-lactamase in P. vulgaris, perhaps accounting for its paradoxical antibacterial effect.\r"

Patients were excluded if the initial sputum Gram stain was highly suggestive of infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or an enteric gram-negative bacillus. The two study groups had comparable demographic and presenting clinical features. The mean age of the patients evaluable for determination of clinical efficacy was 69 years, and greater than 75% had at least one serious underlying medical disorder. In the 90 evaluable patients, there were 11 therapeutic failures (12%), including 5 deaths (5%). Cefamandole, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, was not more efficacious than ampicillin in producing a satisfactory clinical response or in shortening the duration of parenteral therapy. Patients received an average of only 4 days of intravenous antibiotics before changeover to oral therapy and were hospitalized for a mean of 7 days. No patient experienced a relapse of pneumonia following successful completion of parenteral drug therapy. We conclude that cefamandole is not a more effective agent than ampicillin for empiric therapy of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia of uncertain etiology.\r"

We compared antibiotic resistance patterns of Escherichia coli isolated from the urine of bacteriuric female abattoir workers with resistance patterns of E. coli cultured from 190 poultry taken from the processing line. We found E. coli in 181 (95%) of the poultry cultures; 96% of the isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics, and 87% were multiply resistant. Of the 649 women whose urine was cultured and who had not recently received antibiotic therapy, 69 (10.6%) had positive urine cultures, with E. coli accounting for 67% of the isolates. Of the 46 E. coli isolates, 8 (17.4%) were resistant to one or more antibiotics. All of the antibiograms of the urinary isolates were unique, and only one, a strain with resistance only to streptomycin, matched those of any of the poultry isolates. Of the women tested for bacteriuria, 74 had taken antibiotics within 3 months of culture, and these women were analyzed separately. Among the recent antibiotic users, six (8.1%) had positive urine cultures, all with E. coli. Four of these isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic; all had patterns that matched at least one of the poultry isolates. Therefore, in a population of female abattoir workers who were not receiving antibiotic therapy, despite a high exposure to resistant microorganisms of animal origin, infections were infrequently caused by organisms with resistance patterns characteristic of the livestock to which the women were heavily exposed.\r"

We present the results of the first year of cardiac transplantation at a 385-bed community hospital. Twelve patients were selected according to generally accepted criteria from a pool of 24 referrals, all from within 75 miles of our institution. All patients were in New York Heart Association Class IV preoperatively. The one-year survival rate was found to be 82%, which is equivalent to that reported by established centers. All surviving patients were fully rehabilitated. Rates of infection and rejection were lower than expected, and costs were about half the national average. This series, in all likelihood, tests the limits to which the decentralization of cardiac transplant services can be taken. We conclude that cardiac transplantation can be accomplished at a community hospital with results, even for the first patients undergoing transplantation, comparable to those obtained by established programs at major medical centers.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical experience with cardiac myxomas and \"myxoid imitators\" at the Humana Heart Institute International is reviewed and contrasted with a comprehensive review of the world literature. Twenty-two patients with primary cardiac tumors have been treated at our institution. Three (13.6%) of them had myxoid imitators, and 19 had classic myxomas. One of the 19 patients with a classic myxoma had recurrence on two occasions (recurrence rate, 5.3%). The cases of 57 patients from the world literature are reviewed. Recurrence and/or metastases (including formation of mycotic aneurysm) occurred in approximately 50% of these patients. The overall mortality in these patients was 47%. This review provides documentation of the malignant clinical behavior of cardiac myxomas and myxoid imitators. Neither local recurrence nor regrowth of the tumor in a new location, whether intracardiac or extracardiac, can be predicted from the microscopic appearance of the primary tumor. Resection of the myxoma with a wide margin is the recommended surgical procedure but does not ensure a cure. Therefore, long-term follow-up is mandatory.\r"

The effects of daily indirect electric stimulation on the proteolytic activities of immobilized muscles were also studied. In gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior, electric stimulation partially prevented the loss of muscle weight after immobilization for one week. Activities of CD and beta-GU were highest in the soleus, but the activities did not change therein after immobilization or electric stimulation. In gastrocnemius, the activities of CD and AKP and the AA rate increased significantly after immobilization. Electric stimulation during immobilization seemed to prevent the increase of CD and AKP activities significantly after one (CD) and three (AKP) weeks immobilization. In tibialis anterior, the activities of CD and AKP and the AA rate increased significantly in the stimulated muscles after immobilization for three weeks. Both in the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior the beta-GU activity increased significantly in the stimulated muscles. The results suggest that during the disuse atrophy process and electric stimulation of immobilized muscles, rat hind-limb muscles differ in acid and alkaline proteolytic responses.\r"

In 1981 current ambulation, neurologic level, and early motor achievement were determined in 77 of the surviving 80 children by chart review and questionnaire. Of these 77, 20 were not walking at all, one was walking only in therapy, and the remaining 56 were community ambulators (16 of these occasionally used wheelchairs). The actual distance walked daily varied from 100 to 5,000 meters in this group, with 19 of these community ambulators never walking as far as around a block. Five children never walked, 16 had stopped walking by 1981, and another six, although still walking, were doing less than they had previously. In 20 of the 22 who showed a decrease in total walking between the ages of ten and 15, the beginning of the decline was associated with a period of immobilization, demonstrating the potentially adverse effects of immobilization in these children. The ability to walk outdoors independently and to use a wheelchair by age seven predicted ambulation as an adolescent correctly for 87% of the children. In contrast, neurologic level predicted adolescent mobility correctly for only 71%.\r"

All five cases occurred in a subgroup of 11 patients who had received cyclosporine. A retrospective epidemiologic survey of the infected patients revealed all five were heterosexual white men with onset of Pneumocystis pneumonia two to six months after cadaveric transplantation. All received cyclosporine and corticosteroids, and four of five patients also received azathioprine; none was neutropenic or had evidence of concurrent cytomegalovirus infection. Only one of these patients responded to therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, one patient responded to pentamidine therapy, and the remaining three patients died. Cyclosporine use may be related to development of Pneumocystis infections that are refractory to conventional antiprotozoal therapy, and transplantation programs should closely survey patients for such complications.\r"

Elevated CSF IgM index and oligoclonal IgG bands in CSF and serum were commonly found, especially in patients with CNS involvement. Cerebrospinal fluid IgG and IgA indexes were usually normal. Increased CSF to serum albumin ratio, reflecting blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and increased CSF beta 2-microglobulin concentration were most common in patients with CNS involvement.

The other had bilateral lesions that affected about 15% of the left DM and less than 5% of the right DM. The mamillothalamic tract appeared intact in both patients. Considering that medial thalamic lesions commonly cause amnesia in human beings as well as nonhuman primates, there are two possible reasons, alone or in combination, that may explain why these patients failed to have amnesia: the amount of DM damage was less than required to cause amnesia; or the amnesia related to thalamic lesions requires damage to a second structure, such as the mamillothalamic tract or the anterior nucleus.\r"

Intraocular pressure rise was measured hourly for the first three hours after operation, at one week, and at one month. Eyes treated with ALO 2145 had both significantly lower mean IOPs and greater IOP decreases from baseline than placebo-treated eyes during the first three hours after operation. No eyes treated with ALO 2145 and six eyes (18%) treated with placebo experienced an IOP rise of 10 mm Hg or greater. Twenty eyes (59%) in the placebo group and eight eyes (21%) treated with ALO 2145 had an IOP elevation. No change was detected in the mean heart rate. ALO 2145 appears to be effective in eliminating large, acute IOP elevations after argon laser trabeculoplasty.\r"

The most common intraoperative complication was hemorrhage in the angle. Although the angle was open 360 degrees to the ciliary body in 12 of the 13 eyes at the end of surgery, a few peripheral anterior synechiae recurred in six eyes at six weeks. Short-term results suggest that this technique can restore the structure of the anterior ocular segment, decrease progressive peripheral anterior synechiae and glaucoma, and possibly decrease cystoid macular edema.\r"

Adherent cell supernatants (ACS) were added to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the effects on IgG synthesis, the number of Ig-secreting cells (ISC), and proliferation were determined. Exposure of SLE mononuclear cells to autologous ACS caused an increase (approximately two-fold) in IgG production and ISC numbers. In contrast, exposure of normal mononuclear cells to autologous ACS did not significantly increase IgG production or ISC numbers. Addition of SLE ACS to cultures of normal mononuclear cells did not stimulate ISC production. There was no significant level of 3H-thymidine uptake by cultures of SLE or normal mononuclear cells in response to either SLE or normal ACS. In the presence of an excess number of autologous T cells, ACS stimulation of IgG synthesis was further enhanced. These findings indicate that adherent monocytes contribute to B cell hyperactivity in SLE by stimulating B cell differentiation. SLE mononuclear cells appear to be more responsive to ACS stimulation than are normal mononuclear cells.\r"

Serum levels of haptoglobin, alpha-2-macroglobulin and pre-albumin were measured fasting and 6 hr after oral ethanol 0.75 g/kg body weight in 8 healthy controls, 13 patients with alcoholic liver disease and 13 with non-alcoholic-related liver damage, both patient groups being further subdivided into those with and without cirrhosis. Basal levels of haptoglobin were significantly higher in non-cirrhotic alcoholics than controls and pre-albumin levels were lower in non-alcohol-related cirrhotic liver disease. In response to ethanol challenge, no consistent change was observed in any group, nor was there any significant difference between groups. There was, however, a significant correlation (r = 0.53, P less than 0.005) between the percentage changes in haptoglobin and alpha-2-macroglobulin. In 16 subjects (2 controls, 8 alcoholics and 6 non-alcoholics) blood levels of ethanol and acetaldehyde were measured serially: there was no relationship between the peak or mean concentration and the glycoprotein response. This study does not substantiate other reports which claimed to be able to predict the severity and reversibility of alcoholic liver disease on the basis of the serum glycoprotein response to ethanol: ethanol challenge with measurement of serum glycoproteins cannot substitute for proper histological assessment.\r"

In this study, all adult patients with facial fractures who had not received antibiotics were asked to participate in a clinical trial. There were 101 patients with facial fractures enrolled into the study and randomized prospectively into two groups. One group received no antibiotics. The other group received cefazolin sodium, 1 g intravenously, one hour prior to the surgical procedure, and a similar dose eight hours later. Of the 101 patients enrolled in the study, 79 had mandibular fractures, 18 had zygoma fractures, and four had Le Fort fractures. When all facial fractures were considered, perioperative intravenous cefazolin reduced the incidence of postoperative infections; 42.2% in the no-antibiotic group became infected, and 8.9% in the antibiotic group became infected. On the basis of this study, we conclude that cefazolin, used perioperatively, diminished the incidence of postoperative infections in facial fractures.\r"

The neutralization response after HIV infection appeared slow, with neutralization titers remaining low, at or below 1:5, at 7 months following seroconversion. Comparison of 78 HIV seropositive subjects with AIDS, AIDS-related complex, or no symptoms failed to reveal any significant differences in titer which correlated with clinical status. However, a greater proportion of AIDS patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (11/12) had neutralization titers of 1:20 or greater than did AIDS patients with opportunistic infections (2/11). Serum samples were analyzed by Western blot for their reactivity to specific viral proteins. Clinical status could not be predicted by a particular serological profile. However, sera which reacted with the HIV major envelope glycoprotein gp120 tended to have higher neutralization titers, suggesting that gp120 may be a target of anti-HIV neutralizing antibody in man.\r"

ENV-9 is a protein representing the carboxy terminus of gp120 and part of gp41 which is highly immunoreactive. GAG-1 represents 83% and GAG-55 100% of the amino acids of the gag open reading frame. The purified proteins allow sensitive detection by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of antibodies directed against either env or gag of HIV. We have determined the reactivity of sera from several HIV exposed individuals, either form high risk populations or with clinically defined conditions, in the ENV-9, GAG-55, and GAG-1 assays and found that two major seropositive groups are observed. The quantitative analysis of sera with env and gag antigens by ELISA showed AIDS patients had very low gag reactivity while retaining high env reactivity. Results obtained with authentic p24 viral protein in both ELISA and radioimmunoassay correlated to those from the GAG-55 ELISA. This correlation and the analysis of sera with both the ENV and GAG ELISAs indicate that the antibodies reactive to gag are specifically affected relative to env reactivity and that different levels of antibodies to separate viral components in these sera may correlate with disease state.\r"

The sera were subdivided on the basis of their reactivity in at least two anti-HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA); 53 sera were negative and 61 sera were positive in both tests, whereas 69 sera showed ambiguous reactions. The reaction patterns in RIPA could be divided into 6 different groups. The same grouping could to some extent be applied to the results of WB test. RIPA provided the most efficient means for identification of the large viral envelope glycoproteins, gp120/160, whereas gp41 was detected more effectively by WB. Internal virus components reacted to a varying extent with specific antibodies in the two tests. The reaction with pol products was more pronounced with the WB tests in which extracellular material was used as antigen. In a few WB tests, however, the reaction with internal components did not reflect a prior HIV infection. No such ambiguity was observed with RIPA, reflecting the advantage of a test that uses a minimally denaturated antigen and provides appropriate conditions for identification of the large viral glycoproteins. The practical choice of confirmatory tests to be used in diagnostic laboratories requires evaluation of both the sensitivity and specificity of the tests but also their economy and convenience.\r"

Nine patients with coronary artery disease, early positive exercise tests, and transient daytime and nocturnal ambulatory ST segment changes were initially assessed off all antianginal medication. They were then treated with each drug for three five day periods. Angina diaries were reviewed and maximal treadmill exercise tests and 48 hour ambulatory ST segment monitoring were performed at the end of each treatment period. Resting and exercise heart rate and blood pressure were significantly lower on atenolol than on either isosorbide mononitrate or nifedipine. The duration of exercise to 1 mm ST segment depression was significantly greater on atenolol than on isosorbide mononitrate. Only one patient had an improvement in exercise tolerance on nifedipine that was greater than the improvement on atenolol; this patient had single vessel disease. The total number and duration of episodes of ST segment change during ambulatory monitoring were significantly lower with atenolol than on either isosorbide mononitrate or nifedipine. Nocturnal ST segment changes were abolished in six patients on atenolol, in six patients on nifedipine, and in five patients on isosorbide mononitrate. When nocturnal ST segment changes occurred, their frequency was reduced with all three drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The characteristics of the two groups were similar. Evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia was sought by continuous electrocardiographic Holter recordings and acute myocardial infarction by the appearance of new Q waves and increased activity of the creatine kinase MB isoenzyme. Episodes of acute myocardial ischaemia were found in 18% of patients in the control group and in none of those who received isosorbide dinitrate. None the less, the frequency of perioperative myocardial infarction was similar (22% and 18% respectively) in the two groups. Perioperative infarction was significantly more common in women, in patients with unstable angina or poor left ventricular function, in those who had coronary endarterectomy, and in those in whom the aortic clamping time was greater than 50 minutes. These factors may have obscured any effect that prevention of preoperative ischaemia had on perioperative infarction. Preoperative infusion of isosorbide dinitrate eliminated preoperative ischaemia but did not influence the occurrence of perioperative infarction. The probable benefits of prevention of preoperative ischaemia on postoperative left ventricular function, which is a determinant of long term survival, remain to be established.\r"

A double blind placebo controlled crossover trial was therefore conducted to investigate the clinical and haemodynamic effects of felodipine in 15 patients with chronic ischaemic heart failure in New York Heart Association symptom class III. Felodipine significantly increased resting and exercise (25W bicycle ergometry) cardiac output without producing concomitant changes in resting or exercise heart rate or right and left ventricular filling pressures. Felodipine did not significantly improve symptom scores or exercise capacity in the group as a whole. It also resulted in significant fluid retention as shown by a rise in ankle circumference, body weight, and a fall in haematocrit. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism that is responsible for the discrepancy between the haemodynamic and clinical effects of felodipine in patients with moderately severe heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "In the past two to three decades, advancing knowledge in the areas of physiology, pharmacology and scientific technology have allowed diversification from the purely technical aspects of administration of anaesthesia towards more accurate assessment of outcome for the individual in terms of both anaesthetic-induced morbidity and mortality. In addition, elucidation of the aetiology of the morbidity and mortality produced by anaesthesia, as opposed to that from surgery or concomitant medical or surgical disease processes, is assuming increased importance as a result of the expansion in medical litigation, where anaesthetists find themselves amongst the higher risk specialties in medicine. The morbidity produced by anaesthesia is relatively easy to define for specific populations, but the prediction of risk in an isolated individual remains elusive. For example, there are many studies indicating the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction following surgical procedures in defined groups; but for the individual patient, more sophisticated risk assessments have so far failed to predict more accurately than the well-established ASA grading system. Nonetheless, it is expected that in future, studies in this area will permit increased precision in the assessment of risk, thereby permitting better consideration by both surgeon and patient of the options available regarding surgical and non-surgical therapy. Increasing emphasis on the safer administration of anaesthesia has been greatly aided by the use of the critical incident technique. By assessing near-misses in addition to existing morbidity and mortality, the technique increases the size and extent of the database, and by removal of the reticence inherent in an anaesthetist's confession of his mistakes, it increases the reporting of potential mishaps. Amongst the useful findings to have emerged from such studies is the previously unforeseen and unsuspected observation that the most dangerous period of anaesthesia is not during induction and recovery, but during the maintenance period. However, perhaps one of the more valuable aspects of this type of methodology is its potential use in quality control and audit within departments. There are undoubted problems and universally acknowledged difficulties in epidemiological research into anaesthetic mortality. Comparison of data between studies is rendered difficult owing to variations in procedure, including its prospective or retrospective nature, the definition of death, the perioperative time period studied, and the patient and hospital populations encompassed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the unlikely eventuality that human error and equipment failure in anaesthesia can be eradicated, some patient injury will inevitably still occur. For this reason tort reform is necessary, and alternatives to the tort system need to be developed to compensate injured parties adequately without bankrupting the medical system.\r"

  ".U": "87299544\r", 
  ".W": "Using Doppler ultrasound directed at the aortic arch, stroke and minute distance were measured in 45 normal singleton pregnancies and compared with 42 controls. In the non-pregnant controls, stroke distance was 5% more in the supine than in the left lateral position (P less than 0.01) and during pregnancy this relativity was maintained until 36 weeks gestation. In the supine and left lateral positions respectively, stroke distance was increased by 8% (both) at 4 weeks (P less than 0.05 and NS), by 14 and 11% at 8 weeks (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01) and showed a maximum increase of 21 and 20% at 16 weeks gestation (both P less than 0.001). At 40 weeks, supine stroke distance was 14% less than the non-pregnant control value (P less than 0.001), and 6% less than the value in the left lateral position (P less than 0.05), which was itself not significantly different from that in the non-pregnant controls. The maximum increase of heart rate was at 32 weeks, by 24% in the supine and by 19% in the left lateral position (both P less than 0.001). Minute distance was maximally increased by 37% in the supine at 16 weeks (P less than 0.001) and by 30% in the left lateral position at 24 weeks (P less than 0.001). Thereafter, minute distance, measured in both positions, declined until at 40 weeks it was not significantly different from the non-pregnant control value.\r"

  ".W": "Stroke and minute distance were measured in 12 women in late pregnancy using Doppler ultrasound. In each patient two sets of measurements were made every 2 min for 20 min in the supine and left lateral positions, the sequence of positions being reversed on the second occasion. Within each of the four 20 min measurement periods there were no significant changes with time in stroke distance, heart rate, or minute distance, or in their coefficients of variation. From this evidence there is no justification for delaying the measurement of cardiac output until a 'steady state' is reached. The measurements were influenced both by the sequence and the position in which they were taken, the effects being additive. Overall, stroke distance was 5.1% greater in the left lateral than in the supine position, heart rate was 3.7% less and minute distance not significantly different. Independent of posture, stroke distance was 6.5% greater in the second period of measurement than in the first, heart rate was 3% less and minute distance 2.8% more. In late pregnancy the relative magnitude of cardiac output in the left lateral and supine positions has to be interpreted in the light of a stepwise increase of aortic blood flow with change of posture.\r"

If a delta AFP of greater than 25 micrograms/l represents a feto-maternal haemorrhage (FMH) attributable to amniocentesis, the rate of amniocentesis-induced FMH was 17%. Such FMH was seen significantly more often after transplacental amniocentesis or after amniocentesis performed by less experienced operators.

Before ovulation the mean oestradiol-17 beta level in plasma and peritoneal fluid was not essentially different; the mean progesterone level was significantly higher in peritoneal fluid. After ovulation both the mean oestradiol-17 beta and progesterone levels were significantly higher in peritoneal fluid than in plasma. In peritoneal fluid, there was a wide distribution of individual oestradiol-17 beta values before and after ovulation; no significant difference existed between the mean pre- and postovulatory oestradiol-17 beta level. More consistent changes were seen in peritoneal fluid progesterone levels; the mean level was significantly higher after ovulation. In three subjects, a low postovulatory progesterone level in peritoneal fluid was associated with a cystic luteal structure observed by ultrasound, suggesting a reduced leakage of fluid from the ovulation stigma.\r"

Women holding their full records were significantly more likely to feel in control of their antenatal care (rate ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.95) and to feel it was easier to talk to doctors and midwives (rate ratio 1.73; 95% confidence interval 1.16-2.59). No other beneficial effects were detected. Asked about their preferences for any subsequent pregnancies, women holding their own records in the index pregnancy were more likely to say they would prefer to hold the same kind of record again in a subsequent pregnancy than were women holding a co-operation card (rate ratio 1.56; 95% confidence interval 1.34-1.81). There was no evidence of negative effects. In particular, women holding their case notes did not feel more anxious than co-operation card holders. The policy of women holding their notes resulted in savings in clerical time, without evidence of an increase in the rate of lost notes.\r"

An iso-risk curve shows, for women of all ages, which combinations of maternal age and level of maternal serum AFP result in the same risk of carrying a fetus with Down's syndrome. A 1:400 risk of Down's syndrome, corresponding to the risk of a 35-year-old woman, was chosen as the lowest risk indicating referral for amniocentesis. If all women, irrespective of their age, are offered amniocentesis, when their risk of carrying a Down's syndrome fetus is 1:400 or higher, 53% of the affected fetuses can be detected as compared with 28% of the affected fetuses diagnosed at present in women above 35 years of age.\r"

Our results demonstrated a significant negative correlation between fetal heart rate, A/B ratio and RI (in the antepartum group r = -0.49, and in the labouring group r = -0.65). It is therefore important when performing mathematical analysis of umbilical artery flow velocity profiles to make a statistical allowance for fetal heart rate.\r"

All measures of inflammatory response were significantly less in the group of patients receiving flurbiprofen, and in most cases the clinician's assessment as to which group each patient belonged to was correct.

  ".W": "KU-812-F is a subclone of KU-812, which has cytological features similar to the parent clone, and which carries the Philadelphia chromosome. We studied the effects of various chemical agents and serum-free culture (SF-C) condition on its differentiation. The KU-812-F subclone differentiated into macrophage-like cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), but not with other agents. Unexpectedly, under SF-C, KU-812-F cells differentiated into mature basophil-like cells, and the histamine content of cell lysates increased in proportion to maturation. The addition of the condensed supernatant of SF-C promoted the cloning efficiency of KU-812-F cells in semisolid SF-C, whereas the cloning efficiency was reduced in SF-C alone. KU-812-F cells expressed myelomonocytic antigens. Additionally, My4 was induced with PMA and SF-C, but less often. HLA-DR was not expressed in any culture conditions, despite blastic morphology of KU-812-F cells or macrophage-like cells induced with PMA. The IgE receptor could not be demonstrated under any conditions. Correspondingly, immature and mature KU-812-F cells did not respond to anti-IgE or concanavalin A (con A), while histamine release was induced with PMA. In conclusion, KU-812-F belongs to the myeloid cell lineage and is at least a bipotential cell that can differentiate into basophils and macrophage-like cells. Although the functions appear to be dissimilar to those of normal basophils, the KU-812-F cell line may be a good model for basophil differentiation. Moreover, KU-812-F cells may provide new insights because they grow in semisolid culture by an autostimulating mechanism.\r"

This antibody predominantly recognizes B cells of follicular mantle and germinal center cells, as well as plasma cells in normal lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, 80% of all low- and high-grade B cell lymphomas are stained, whereas among T cell lymphomas, only four of 15 T lymphoblastic lymphomas were positive to Ki-B3. All peripheral T cell lymphomas showed a negative reaction. Additionally, Ki-B3 detects a small percentage of monocytes and some myelomonocytic leukemias. All epithelial tissues as well as all sarcomas tested were invariably negative. Ki-B3 precipitates a 220 kiloDalton (kD) molecular weight antigen similar to the leukocyte common antigen. Presumably Ki-B3 detects a subtype of the leukocyte common antigen that is predominantly expressed on mature and immature B cells. As the antigen is formalin resistant, Ki-B3 can be used in routine hematology on paraffin sections for the detection and differential diagnosis of B cell lymphomas.\r"

No patient received prophylactic anti-graft-v-host disease (GVHD) therapy posttransplant, and only one patient developed significant GVHD, which involved the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Seven others showed some manifestations of GVHD, but these were of minimal clinical significance and required only occasional steroid therapy. Overall, eight patients are alive and well; eight did not survive. Polyclonal immunoglobulin synthesis by donor memory B cells was seen shortly after transplantation, with peak donor-derived serum levels seen approximately 2 months after transplantation. After this initial immunoglobulin synthesis waned, another wave of B cell responses developed. This immunoglobulin response appears to be permanent. T cell functions appeared as soon as 3 weeks after transplantation. This experience in a variety of patients with combined immunodeficiency who received transplants with monoclonal antibody T cell-depleted marrow shows gratifying results with a consistent T and B cell benefit.\r"

Antibodies to Hemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) capsular polysaccharide were determined in 28 cases. Abnormally low or borderline subclass (mostly IgG2 and IgG4) levels were found late after transplant in 23 infected and noninfected patients. These levels persisted for as long as 25 months, in association with low or borderline IgA levels in 78% of the cases. IgG2, IgG4, and IgA often showed a parallel evolution, whereas IgG1, IgG3, and IgM often varied together in the opposite way. Class but not subclass deficiencies were more frequent in patients with graft-v-host disease (GVHD). Subclass abnormalities predominated in infected patients, with mean levels correlating with the severity of infections; however, the abnormalities are not clearly predictive of infections in individual cases. Most patients with Hib pneumonia showed virtually no IgG antibody response to Hib, and one-half of the patients had a moderate IgM and IgA response. In the whole series, many sera collected greater than 1 year after graft contained very low or undetectable antibodies. Correlation between anti-Hib antibody and IgG2 levels was significant but weak because of discrepancies that were only partially explained by the subclass distribution of the antibodies.\r"

These biotinylated cells exhibited a normal survival rate when reinfused into rabbits. Two studies demonstrated that the biotin label was stable in vivo. The first was a double-labeling experiment where the biotinylated erythrocytes were also labeled with 14C-cyanate; on reinfusion, the loss of biotinylated erythrocytes and 14C-cyanate label occurred in unison. The second study demonstrated that biotinylated erythrocytes that had been reinfused into rabbits could later be selectively isolated by attachment to an avidin support. This technique will facilitate a variety of studies that require the ability to label a specific cohort of cells in vitro and then reisolate those same cells after in vivo recirculation.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils activated with serum opsonized zymosan, soluble heat-aggregated IgG, and ionophore A23187 in the presence of calcium release a material capable of initially activating factor V. Subsequent inactivation of factor V was only observed with neutrophil releasate derived from IgG and ionophore. In this study we examine the nature of this neutrophil activity and investigate its role in the regulation of factor V/Va. From early in the fractionation it was apparent that the cells contained different enzymes capable of cleaving factor V. The most active of these was isolated and found to be an isomer of human neutrophil elastase. The purified protease caused a dose-dependent activation of isolated factor V to a maximum of threefold. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, single-chain factor V was cleaved to form intermediates of 100 and 91 kilodaltons (kD). Coagulant activity correlated with the formation of a 97-kD heavy and 77-kD light chain. On prolonged incubation the formed factor Va(e) was inactivated in association with proteolysis of the 97-kD band to smaller peptides and cleavage of the 77-kD light chain to a molecular weight of 75 kD, which is similar to thrombin-activated factor Va light chain. Neutrophil elastase also caused rapid inactivation of thrombin-activated factor V, factor Va(t). These observations suggest that elastase cleaves factor V at sites distinct from that by thrombin and therefore represents a novel factor V activation pattern. It is proposed that upon neutrophil activation elastase is secreted into the plasma milieu to initiate factor V activation. This serves to generate small amounts of thrombin that, in turn, by positive feedback fully activates factor V and thus amplifies the coagulation reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Characterization of glucocorticoid receptors in leukemia cells is important to understand mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance but has been impeded by receptor fragmentation in cytosol extracts. We recently found that formation of 52- and 30-kilodalton (kD) glucocorticoid receptor fragments in cytosol of leukemia cells is due to proteolysis and is blocked by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). In the present study, we identify a 28-kD serine protease in cytosol of leukemia cells that binds [3H]DFP and correlates with the formation of 52- and 30-kD receptor fragments. This protease is immunoprecipitated by antiserum to neutrophil elastase. Limited digestion of [3H]dexamethasone-21-mesylate-labeled receptors by purified neutrophil elastase produces 52- and 30-kD receptor fragments. Receptor fragmentation in the cytosol of leukemia cells in inhibited by methoxysuccinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valyl-chloromethylketone, a highly specific inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. The addition of as few as 5% neutrophils to a lymphoid cell suspension provides sufficient elastase to produce receptor fragmentation. Our findings indicate that neutrophil elastase is responsible for receptor fragmentation in the cytosol of leukemia cells. The neutrophil elastase may be endogenous to the leukemia cells or may come from neutrophils that contaminate leukemia cell suspensions.\r"

Using minisatellite probes we showed that the relapse occurred in cells of host origin in all four patients and this was confirmed with a Y chromosome specific probe in two male patients who had a female donor. Furthermore, using two probes for the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) on chromosome 22, we showed that leukemic cells at relapse bore identical rearrangements to those in the disease at time of presentation of each patient. We conclude that relapse in all four patients is due to re-emergence of the original leukemic clone.\r"

In all cases donors and recipients were HLA DR identical and had low MLC reactivity. In three cases recipients received marrow that was identical at the HLA A,B loci. In five cases HLA identity differed for one HLA A locus antigen. The unrelated donor search interval ranged from 2 to 28 months (median, 3 months). All recipients were prepared with a combination of cyclophosphamide, 60 mg/kg/d administered intravenously (IV) (days -6,-5) and with total body irradiation administered in 165 cGy fractions twice daily for four days (days -4, -3, -2, -1). Engraftment occurred in all cases (range, 18 to 48 days; median, 35 days), and return to a complete Philadelphia chromosome (Ph') negative state was documented in six of eight cases. Moderate or severe acute graft v host disease (GVHD) occurred in seven of eight cases, and extensive chronic GVHD in four of six evaluable recipients. A B cell lymphoproliferative disorder developed in one patient. Four recipients have died within 2 to 4 months of transplant. Four of eight patients survive at 11+ to 24+ months following transplantation (median, 15+ months) with normal peripheral blood counts and without evidence of leukemia. Current Karnofsky activity assessments are 90% or 100% in all survivors. Curative therapy of CML has been available only to the minority of patients eligible for sibling donor BMT. Unrelated donor BMT can be effective in the treatment of CML and may be particularly useful in this disorder since the prolonged stable phase of disease offers an opportunity to locate suitable donors.\r"

Since lymphoproliferative disorders may occur following bone marrow transplantation (BMT), it may be difficult to distinguish posttransplant relapse of CML lymphoid blast crisis from de novo lymphoproliferation. Lymphoid blast crisis cells from a patient with CML displayed immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (C mu) rearrangement before BMT. Following BMT the patient developed a lymphoproliferative disorder involving multiple organs. Clonal rearrangement of C mu was demonstrated in several involved tissues. The rearranged C mu restriction fragment was distinct from that displayed before BMT. Additionally, rearrangement of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) was demonstrated in the pretransplant blast crisis sample, but not in the posttransplant lymphoproliferation samples, thus confirming that these lymphoproliferative disorders were distinct. Molecular genetic techniques offer powerful diagnostic tools for monitoring the course of patients with CML undergoing BMT.\r"

The method involves using a static-image B-mode ultrasound scanner to obtain scans at the hips and knees of the lower limbs. A technique using bone-surface contours is reported for defining, on each hip scan, the head-neck line and, on each knee scan, the transcondylar line. By superimposing the transcondylar line on the head-neck line, the angle of femoral anteversion (torsion) was calculated for each limb. In the reliability study, scans were obtained three times at both hips and knees of each subject. The femoral anteversion was measured for each limb. The intra-observer error was within +/- 2.3 degrees (95% confidence limits) between scans, which was not statistically significant for the measured anteversion in each of the right and left femora of children and adults separately. To test the validity of the tracing method used to calculate femoral anteversion, one set of scans from the hip and knee of each subject was measured four times; no significant difference was found between tracings for the measurements of femoral anteversion. The ultrasound method is recommended for clinical use. We consider the static-image B-mode scanner to be the instrument of choice for measuring femoral anteversion in living subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The sonographic patterns of focal lesions of the liver and spleen in 26 patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are described. Thirteen out of 19 hepatic lesions and nine out of 11 splenic lesions corresponded to a nodular lymphomatous involvement. The remaining cases involved benign focal lesions of the liver and spleen. The vast majority of the hepatic and splenic lymphomatous nodules had a hypoechoic pattern with indistinct edges. Target lesions of the liver were seen only in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Echogenic lymphomatous nodules could not be detected. All echogenic lesions (three) were biopsied and found to be benign. Whereas a focal liver involvement almost always occurred in combination with hepatomegaly, only two out of nine patients with splenic foci had splenomegaly. The response of hepatic and splenic lymphoma to chemotherapy is described from follow-up examinations in 11 cases. Because of the inherent risk of over-treatment of the false positive interpretation of hepatic nodules, the large-scale use of needle biopsy in sonographically equivocal lesions is strongly advocated.\r"

Each ventriculogram was processed with a specific videodensitometric analysis to determine LV ejection fraction. The program was verified in an experimental set-up consisting of nine latex balloons filled with contrast medium. Its validation has been established by comparing videodensitometric results with classical results supplied by geometric methods. A good correlation was obtained (r = 0.9449) and, furthermore, with experimental models, videodensitometric analysis seemed to be more accurate than geometric analysis. Digital videodensitometry appears to be a valuable and accurate method for quantifying LV function, and a promising technique for determination of the real volumes.\r"

The findings were correlated with surgical findings in all except two patients who had gross caval involvement and metastatic disease and in whom surgery was considered inappropriate. In 10 of the 28 patients (36%), a diagnostic ultrasound examination of the cava from the renal veins to the diaphragm was obtained. In four of these, ultrasound showed tumour involvement of the vena cava. In 12 cases (43%) only the intrahepatic part of the cava was seen, but the examination nonetheless excluded tumour involvement of the upper cava. Visualisation of the vena cava was impossible in six cases (21%), usually because of bowel gas or obesity; CT scanning provided valuable additional information in two of these cases. Inferior vena cavography confirmed the findings of the less invasive imaging procedures in 10 patients and was falsely positive once. Cavography is now seldom necessary in the assessment of renal carcinoma.\r"

In patients with IC the median concentration of U-ECP was 140 arbitrary u/l versus 14 arb. u/l in the remaining patients (P less than 0.001). The mean peripheral leukocyte count was significantly lower in the IC group (P less than 0.05). Tissue infiltration with eosinophils was found in 43% of the bladder biopsies from patients with IC compared with 4% of the biopsies in the remaining patients (P less than 0.05). A negative correlation between peripheral eosinophils and U-ECP was found in the patients with IC (r = 0.52, P less than 0.05). These results suggest that eosinophils are attracted to the inflammatory site in the bladder wall where ECP is released. Eosinophils thus seem to participate actively in the inflammatory process. U-ECP seems to provide valuable diagnostic information when diagnosing IC in patients with painful bladder disease. It is suggested that ECP might be involved in the process of tissue destruction in IC.\r"

A local antigen-specific immunological response, predominantly of the IgA class, was present during Esch. coli cystitis. There was no significant difference (P greater than 0.1) in the urinary or serum levels of any class of immunoglobulins between the recurrent cystitis group when uninfected and the normal women. There was a significant increase (P less than 0.001) in the levels of urinary IgA and secretory IgA during Esch. coli cystitis as compared with the same women when uninfected or with normal women.

This article explores the reasons why North American physicians commemorate a French chest specialist in their name for a hepatic lesion that had first been recognized in England more than a century earlier. It traces the content and fortunes of Laennec's essay on cirrhosis, part of an incomplete manuscript, including its eventual partial publication by a British editor in the original French. A survey of 19th-century literature on cirrhosis revealed that it was not until the publication of William Osler's textbook that the eponym came into common use. The geographic patterns of influence of Osler's book and the differing preoccupations of physicians on the two sides of the English Channel probably combined to result in the paradoxic employment of this eponym.\r"

Serial surveillance cultures of the nasal passages, oropharynx and feces performed twice a week showed that patients who received the former regimen had higher elimination rates and significantly lower acquisition rates (p = 0.027) for aerobic gram-negative bacilli than did patients who received the latter regimen. However, therapy with moxalactam plus ticarcillin also resulted in significantly higher acquisition rates for yeasts (p = 0.004). This was associated with a significantly higher fungal superinfection rate among these patients than among those who received tobramycin plus ticarcillin (40% v. 16%) (p less than 0.05). Moxalactam plus ticarcillin therapy created a greater microbial ecologic vacuum by the elimination of intestinal anaerobes, which, in turn, permitted fungal colonization and an increased risk of superinfection. Our results support the recommendation that an antipseudomonal penicillin plus an aminoglycoside be selected as empiric therapy for suspected infection in febrile granulocytopenic patients with cancer. Such a regimen would spare the anaerobic intestinal microflora, thereby reducing the risk of fungal colonization and infection.\r"

  ".W": "Compliance with medical regimens is as poor or poorer in childhood asthma than it is for other chronic illnesses. A spate of self-management programs for childhood asthma has been developed to counteract nonadherence and to enable patients to be more confident and competent in their ability to prevent or control asthmatic episodes. The programs offer promise and report some encouraging results, but the programs are still unproven, and they are neither widely available nor widely used. The individual physician remains the key player in mounting effective self-management programs; but if the physician is to function effectively in this role, drastic changes are called for in the way that both medical practice is conducted and patient-health care provider relationships are managed. Steps and strategies that would help providers establish effective individual self-management programs for asthmatic patients are outlined.\r"
