  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In vitro fertilization, sometimes involving the cryopreservation of human embryos, has become a routine procedure for the treatment of infertility. Even though there are embryos available for transfer in about 85 percent of the treatment cycles, the rate of pregnancy rarely exceeds 25 percent per cycle. We designed this study to investigate two questions: Does this high rate of failure result from inadequate technique, or does it simply reflect the maximal potential of a cohort of aspirated eggs to produce a pregnancy? And to what extent does cryopreservation affect the capacity for implantation of embryos? METHODS. The study was conducted among patients enrolled in an egg-donation program. Aspirated eggs from a given cohort were distributed to the donor herself and a few recipients. The recipients were prepared by a standard protocol of hormone replacement and were assigned at random to the transfer of either fresh or frozen and thawed embryos. The donors received only fresh embryos. RESULTS. Forty cycles of donation were studied. In 25 cycles (63 percent) pregnancy was established in the donor, in the recipient (or recipients), or in both. Of the fresh embryos that were transferred to the recipients, 24 percent were successfully implanted, as compared with only 7.7 percent of the frozen and thawed embryos (P less than 0.01). A pregnancy success rate of 37 percent per recipient cycle was observed in the recipients of fresh embryos, as compared with a rate of only 16 percent in those receiving frozen and thawed embryos (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. The majority of egg cohorts evidently possess the potential to produce a pregnancy, but cryopreservation of human embryos significantly reduces their capacity for implantation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Fertility in women 40 years of age or older is decreased, and in those with ovarian failure it is thought to be irrevocably lost. The donation of oocytes to young (less than 35 years old) women with ovarian failure has allowed many considered infertile a chance to become pregnant. In these women gonadal hormone replacement results in an endometrium receptive to implantation. It is not known whether the endometrial response to such replacement is decreased in women over the age of 40. METHODS. To test the efficacy of oocyte donation to older women, we enrolled seven women 40 to 44 years old with ovarian failure in a trial of hormone replacement and embryo transfer, using oocytes obtained from women undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation solely for gamete donation. RESULTS. Seven stimulated cycles in the donors that were synchronized with nine cycles in the recipients resulted in eight embryo transfers. Five viable pregnancies were established, one with twins. A sixth pregnancy ended in miscarriage. Five normal infants were delivered by cesarean section, and one stillborn infant was delivered vaginally. The outcomes were compared with those in women under the age of 40 with ovarian failure who were also participating in our donor-oocyte program and in infertile ovulating women 40 or older who were undergoing standard in vitro fertilization. No significant differences in rates of implantation or ongoing pregnancy were noted in older women as compared with younger women receiving donated embryos. These rates, however, were higher than the rates in the infertile ovulating women of similar age who were undergoing standard in vitro fertilization. CONCLUSIONS. These preliminary results suggest that the endometrium retains its ability to respond to gonadal steroids and provides a receptive environment for embryo implantation and gestation even in older women.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The frequency of the hemolytic uremic syndrome, characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, is increasing. Although Escherichia coli serotype 0157:H7 has been implicated as a causative agent, more information is needed about the basic epidemiology and clinical aspects of this syndrome. METHODS. We conducted a retrospective population-based study of hemolytic uremic syndrome in Minnesota residents less than 18 years of age from 1979 through 1988 to assess trends in disease occurrence, describe the clinical illness, and identify predictors of disease severity and outcome. We also conducted a case-control study of patients with onsets of illness from 1986 through 1988 to examine risk factors. RESULTS. One hundred seventeen patients were identified. The mean annual incidence increased from 0.5 case per 100,000 child-years among children less than 18 in 1979 (6 cases) to 2.0 cases per 100,000 in 1988 (26 cases) (P = 0.000004). E. coli 0157:H7 was isolated from 13 of 28 patients (46 percent) who had stool specimens submitted for testing. For those who presented with typical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an elevated polymorphonuclear-leukocyte count on hospital admission, a shorter duration of prodrome, and the presence of bloody diarrhea were predictive of severe disease. In the case-control study, the patients were more likely to attend large daycare centers (more than 50 children) than were the controls (odds ratio, 10.2; P = 0.03), suggesting that day-care attendance may be a risk factor. On the basis of the population-attributable risk, however, this factor could account for no more than 16 percent of the cases. CONCLUSIONS. This study provides evidence for an increase in the incidence of hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is probably related to an increased incidence of E. coli 0157:H7 infections. Hemolytic uremic syndrome has become an important pediatric and public health problem.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The presence of cytoplasmic islet-cell autoantibodies has been recognized as a risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus in relatives of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), but the magnitude of the risk is unknown, as is the influence of other factors, such as age, sex, and race. METHODS. From 1979 through 1989, we studied 4015 initially nondiabetic relatives of 1590 probands with IDDM to determine the risk of IDDM according to the presence and titer of autoantibodies, as well as other factors. RESULTS. Of the 4015 nondiabetic relatives, 125 (3.1 percent) had islet-cell antibodies in their initial serum samples, and 40 contracted IDDM. Islet-cell antibodies were most frequent (4.3 percent) in relatives who were under 20 years of age (P = 0.001) and in those (4.8 percent) from families with more than one affected member (a multiplex pedigree) (P = 0.003). Independent risk factors for the development of diabetes in the relatives included age of less than 10 years at the time of the initial study (P = 0.001), membership in a multiplex pedigree (P = 0.02), and a positive test for islet-cell antibodies in the initial serum sample (P = 0.0001). Twenty-seven of the relatives in whom diabetes developed (67.5 percent) had positive tests for islet-cell antibodies before the diagnosis of IDDM, giving a relative risk of IDDM of 68 (95 percent confidence interval, 34 to 134) for antibody-positive relatives. Islet-cell-antibody titers of 20 Juvenile Diabetes Foundation units or higher were associated with an increasing risk of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS. Nondiabetic relatives of probands with IDDM who are in the first two decades of life, are members of multiplex pedigrees, and have increased titers of islet-cell antibodies are the most likely to contract IDDM themselves.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In a nationally representative population 65 years of age or older, we have demonstrated that about one quarter of coronary angiographies and upper gastrointestinal endoscopies and two thirds of carotid endarterectomies were performed for reasons that were less than medically appropriate. In this paper we examine whether specific characteristics of patients (age, sex, and race), physicians (age, board-certification status, and experience with the procedure), or hospitals (teaching status, profit-making status, and size) predict whether a procedure will be performed appropriately. RESULTS. In general, we found that little of the variability in the appropriateness of care (4 percent or less) could be explained on the basis of standard, easily obtainable data about the patient, the physician, or the hospital. For all three procedures, however, performance in a teaching hospital increased the likelihood that the reasons would be medically appropriate (P = 0.09 for angiography, P = 0.30 for endoscopy, and P less than 0.01 for endarterectomy). In addition, angiographies were more often performed for appropriate reasons in older or more affluent patients (P less than 0.01 for both). Being treated by a surgeon who performed a high rather than a low number of procedures decreased the likelihood of an appropriate endarterectomy by one third, from 40 to 28 percent (P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Appropriateness of care cannot be closely predicted from many easily determined characteristics of patients, physicians, or hospitals. Thus, for the present, if appropriateness is to be improved it will have to be assessed directly at the level of each patient, hospital, and physician.\r"

It is not known to what extent bone loss differs between ovulatory women with regular menstrual cycles who are training intensely and those who are sedentary. METHODS. We measured the density of cancellous spinal bone from the 12th thoracic vertebra to the 3rd lumbar vertebra by quantitative computed tomography on two occasions one year apart in 66 premenopausal women 21 to 42 years of age. All the women had two consecutive ovulatory cycles immediately before entering the study. Twenty-one women were training for a marathon, 22 ran regularly but less intensively, and 23 had normal levels of activity. The lengths of the women's menstrual cycles and luteal phases, diet, exercise levels, and hormonal levels were also determined. We defined ovulatory disturbances as anovulatory cycles and cycles with short luteal phases. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SD) spinal bone density in the 66 women decreased 3.0 +/- 4.8 mg per cubic centimeter per year (2.0 percent per year) (P less than 0.001). Amenorrhea did not develop in any woman during the year of observation (only 2.7 percent of the cycles were greater than 36 days long). Ovulatory disturbances occurred in 29 percent of all cycles, however. Bone loss was strongly associated with these disturbances (r = 0.54, 24 percent of the variance). The 13 women who had anovulatory cycles lost bone mineral at a rate of 6.4 +/- 3.8 mg per cubic centimeter per year (4.2 percent per year). The women training for a marathon had menstrual cycles similar to those of the women in the other two groups. CONCLUSION. Decreases in spinal bone density among women with differing exercise habits correlated with asymptomatic disturbances of ovulation (without amenorrhea) and not with physical activity.\r"

The magnitude of this increase in risk and the effects of the length of follow-up, the extent of disease at diagnosis, and age at diagnosis vary substantially in different studies. METHODS. To provide accurate estimates of the risk of colorectal cancer among patients with ulcerative colitis, we studied a population-based cohort of 3117 patients given a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis from 1922 through 1983 who were followed up through 1984. RESULTS. Ninety-two cases of colorectal cancer occurred in 91 patients. As compared with the expected incidence, the incidence of colorectal cancer in the cohort was increased (standardized incidence ratio [ratio of observed to expected cases] = 5.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 7.0). Less extensive disease at diagnosis was associated with a lower risk; for patients with ulcerative proctitis, the standardized incidence ratio was 1.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 3.2); for those with left-sided colitis, 2.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.4); and for those with pancolitis (extensive colitis, or inflammation of the entire colon), 14.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 11.4 to 18.9). Age at diagnosis and the extent of disease at diagnosis were strong and independent risk factors for colorectal cancer. For each increase in age group at diagnosis (less than 15 years, 15 to 29 years, 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and greater than or equal to 60 years), the relative risk of colorectal cancer, adjusted for the extent of disease at diagnosis, decreased by about half (adjusted standardized incidence ratio = 0.51; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.56). The absolute risk of colorectal cancer 35 years after diagnosis was 30 percent for patients with pancolitis at diagnosis and 40 percent for those given this diagnosis at less than 15 years of age. CONCLUSIONS. Close surveillance and perhaps even prophylactic proctocolectomy should be recommended for patients given a diagnosis of pancolitis, especially those who are less than 15 years of age at diagnosis.\r"

  ".U": "91015255\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP) catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to other lipoproteins. We recently described a Japanese family with increased HDL levels and CETP deficiency due to a splicing defect of the CETP gene. To assess the frequency and phenotype of this condition, we screened 11 additional families with high HDL levels by means of a radioimmunoassay for CETP and DNA analysis. RESULTS. We found the same CETP gene mutation in four families from three different regions of Japan. Analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the mutant CETP allele showed that all probands were homozygous for the identical haplotype. Family members homozygous for CETP deficiency (n = 10) had moderate hypercholesterolemia (mean total cholesterol level [+/- SD], 7.01 +/- 0.83 mmol per liter), markedly increased levels of HDL cholesterol (4.24 +/- 1.01 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein A-I, and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.99 +/- 0.80 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein B. Members heterozygous for the deficiency (n = 20), whose CETP levels were in the lower part of the normal range, had moderately increased levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and an increased ratio of HDL subclass 2 to HDL subclass 3, as compared with unaffected family members (1.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4). CETP deficiency was not found in six unrelated subjects with elevated HDL cholesterol levels who were from different parts of the United States. CONCLUSIONS. CETP deficiency appears to be a frequent cause of increased HDL levels in the population of Japan, possibly because of a founder effect. The results that we observed in heterozygotes suggest that CETP normally plays a part in the regulation of levels of HDL subclass 2. There was no evidence of premature atherosclerosis in the families with CETP deficiency. In fact, the lipoprotein profile of persons with CETP deficiency is potentially antiatherogenic and may be associated with an increased life span.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In the treatment of gallstones with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, the bile acid ursodiol is administered to dissolve the gallstone fragments. We designed our study to determine the value of administering this agent. METHODS. At 10 centers, 600 symptomatic patients with three or fewer radiolucent gallstones 5 to 30 mm in diameter, as visualized by oral cholecystography, were randomly assigned to receive ursodiol or placebo for six months, starting one week before lithotripsy. RESULTS. The stones were fragmented in 97 percent of all patients, and the fragments were less than or equal to 5 mm in diameter in 46.8 percent. On the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis of all 600 patients, 21 percent receiving ursodiol and 9 percent receiving placebo (P less than 0.0001) had gallbladders that were free of stones after six months. Among those with completely radiolucent solitary stones less than 20 mm in diameter, 35 percent of the patients receiving ursodiol and 18 percent of those receiving placebo (P less than 0.001) were free of stones after six months. Biliary pain, usually mild, occurred in 73 percent of all patients but in only 13 percent of those who were free of stones after three and six months (P less than 0.01). There were few adverse events. Only diarrhea occurred with a significantly different frequency in the two groups: 32.6 percent were affected in the ursodiol group, as compared with 24.7 percent in the placebo group (P less than 0.04). Severe biliary pain occurred in 1.5 percent of all patients, acute cholecystitis in 1.0 percent, and acute pancreatitis in 1.5 percent; endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in 0.5 percent, and cholecystectomy in 2.5 percent. CONCLUSIONS. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy with ursodiol was more effective than lithotripsy alone for the treatment of symptomatic gallstones, and equally safe. Treatment was more effective for solitary than multiple stones, radiolucent than slightly calcified stones, and smaller than larger stones.\r"

We evaluated the efficacy of scanning with 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, for tumor localization in 42 patients with carcinoid tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or paragangliomas. We then evaluated the response to octreotide therapy in some of these patients. RESULTS. Primary tumors or metastases, often previously unrecognized, were visualized in 12 of 13 patients with carcinoid tumors and in 7 of 9 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors. The endocrine symptoms of these patients responded well to therapy with octreotide. Among 20 patients with paragangliomas, 8 of whom had more than one tumor, 10 temporal (tympanic or jugular), 9 carotid, and 10 vagal tumors could be visualized. One small tympanic tumor and one small carotid tumor were not seen on the scan. CONCLUSIONS. The 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide scanning technique is a rapid and safe procedure for the visualization of some tumors with somatostatin receptors. A positive scan may predict the ability of octreotide therapy to control symptoms of hormonal hypersecretion.\r"

  ".U": "91015271\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The effect of intensive lipid-lowering therapy on coronary atherosclerosis among men at high risk for cardiovascular events was assessed by quantitative arteriography. Of 146 men no more than 62 years of age who had apolipoprotein B levels greater than or equal to 125 mg per deciliter, documented coronary artery disease, and a family history of vascular disease, 120 completed the 2 1/2-year double-blind study, which included arteriography at base line and after treatment. Patients were given dietary counseling and were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: lovastatin (20 mg twice a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day); niacin (1 g four times a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day); or conventional therapy with placebo (or colestipol if the low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level was elevated). RESULTS. The levels of LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol changed only slightly in the conventional-therapy group (mean changes, -7 and +5 percent, respectively), but more substantially among patients treated with lovastatin and colestipol (-46 and +15 percent) or niacin and colestipol (-32 and +43 percent). In the conventional-therapy group, 46 percent of the patients had definite lesion progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11 percent. By comparison, progression (as the only change) was less frequent among patients who received lovastatin and colestipol (21 percent) and those who received niacin and colestipol (25 percent), and regression was more frequent (lovastatin and colestipol, 32 percent; niacin and colestipol, 39 percent; P less than 0.005). Multivariate analysis indicated that a reduction in the level of apolipoprotein B (or LDL cholesterol) and in systolic blood pressure, and an increase in HDL cholesterol correlated independently with regression of coronary lesions. Clinical events (death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization for worsening symptoms) occurred in 10 of 52 patients assigned to conventional therapy, as compared with 3 of 46 assigned to receive lovastatin and colestipol and 2 of 48 assigned to receive niacin and colestipol (relative risk of an event during intensive treatment, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.77). CONCLUSIONS. In men with coronary artery disease who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, intensive lipid-lowering therapy reduced the frequency of progression of coronary lesions, increased the frequency of regression, and reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. There has been a recent, dramatic increase in the incidence of congenital syphilis, particularly in urban areas. We describe seven infants seen during one year who were first given a diagnosis of congenital syphilis at 3 to 14 weeks of age, when symptoms developed. We reviewed these infants' charts in order to ascertain the reasons for the failure to diagnose syphilis at birth and to identify the signs and symptoms of congenital syphilis in this group of infants. RESULTS. At delivery, four of the infants and their mothers had negative qualitative rapid-plasma-reagin tests for syphilis. The other three mothers had been seronegative during the pregnancy and were therefore not tested at delivery; two of their infants were seronegative at birth, and one was not tested. When the infants became symptomatic between 3 and 14 weeks of age and were admitted to the hospital, all seven infants and the five mothers available for testing were found to be seropositive for syphilis. Four infants presented with a characteristic diffuse rash; the other three presented with fever and were found on admission to have aseptic meningitis. All these infants had multisystem disease, as evidenced by hepatomegaly, increased aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, anemia, and monocytosis. In all the infants syphilis responded to parenteral penicillin. CONCLUSIONS. Congenital syphilis may be missed if serologic tests are not performed for both the mother and her infant at the time of delivery. Even when these tests are performed, some infants are not identified as having syphilis, probably because the infection is very recent and there has been insufficient time for an antibody response to develop. Some infants with congenital syphilis of later onset do not present with a typical rash; therefore, at least in areas where the disease is prevalent, serologic tests for syphilis should be included in the evaluation of all febrile infants, even those with negative results on serologic testing at birth.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Night blindness is an early symptom of retinitis pigmentosa. The rod photoreceptors are responsible for night vision and use rhodopsin as the photosensitive pigment. METHODS AND RESULTS. We found three mutations in the human rhodopsin gene; each occurred exclusively in the affected members of some families with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Two mutations were C-to-T transitions involving separate nucleotides of codon 347; the third was a C-to-G transversion in codon 58. Each mutation corresponded to a change in one amino acid residue in the rhodopsin molecule. None of these mutations were found in 106 unrelated normal subjects who served as controls. When the incidence of these three mutations was added to that of a previously reported mutation involving codon 23, 27 of 150 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (18 percent) were found to carry one of these four defects in the rhodopsin gene. All 27 patients had abnormal rod function on monitoring of their electroretinograms. It appears that patients with the mutation involving codon 23 probably descend from a single ancestor. CONCLUSIONS. In some patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, the disease is caused by one of a variety of mutations of the rhodopsin gene.\r"

A new mechanism for disease was revealed that appears applicable to virtually all endocrine systems, involving the growth as well as the function of endocrine cells. An endocrine gland may fail through at least three autoimmune mechanisms: destruction, atrophy, and inhibition of function. Destruction is probably irreversible but is not usually distinguishable clinically from receptor blockade causing atrophy or from metabolic unresponsiveness. The contribution made by receptor autoimmunity to endocrine diseases other than thyroid disease is at present unclear, but with immunologic manipulation it is potentially reversible, improving the replicative capacity of the gland, its metabolic responsiveness, or both.\r"

  ".W": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common lethal genetic disease that manifests itself in airway and other epithelial cells as defective chloride ion absorption and secretion, resulting at least in part from a defect in a cyclic AMP-regulated, outwardly-rectifying Cl- channel in the apical surface. The gene responsible for CF has been identified and predicted to encode a membrane protein termed the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Identification of a cryptic bacterial promoter within the CFTR coding sequence led us to construct a complementary DNA in a low-copy-number plasmid, thereby avoiding the deleterious effects of CFTR expression on Escherischia coli. We have used this cDNA to express CFTR in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that CFTR is a membrane-associated glycoprotein that can be phosporylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct domains of the protein immunoprecipitated recombinant CFTR as well as the endogenous CFTR in nonrecombinant T84 cells. Partial proteolysis fingerprinting showed that the recombinant and non-recombinant proteins are indistinguishable. These data, which establish several characteristics of the protein responsible for CF, will now enable CFTR function to be studied and will provide a basis for diagnosis and therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium has an important role in regulating epithelial cell ion transport and is itself transported by tissues involved in the maintenance of extracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Although the mechanism of Ca2+ entry in electrically excitable cells is well-documented little is known about it in epithelial cells. Calcium absorption in polarized epithelial cells is a two-step process in which Ca2+ enters cells across apical plasma membranes and is extruded across basolateral membranes. Efflux may be mediated by an energy-dependent Ca2(+)-ATPase or by Na+/Ca2+ exchange. We examined Ca2+ influx in single cultured cells from distal renal tubules sensitive to parathyroid hormone by measuring intracellular Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that parathyroid hormone activates dihydropyridine-sensitive channels responsible for Ca2+ entry. We also show that microtubule-dependent exocytosis stimulated by parathyroid hormone may be necessary for the insertion or activation of Ca2+ channels in these cells. Once inserted or activated, dihydropyridine-sensitive channels mediate Ca2+ entry into these Ca2(+)-transporting epithelial cells. Our results support the view that agonist-induced exocytosis may represent a general paradigm for modulation of transport in epithelial cells by delivery and incorporation of transport proteins to plasma membranes or by delivery to plasma membranes of factors regulating these proteins.\r"

This graded response, characteristic of classically postulated morphogens, may underlie pattern formation, but the response of intact animal caps to XTC-MIF provides only a crude indication of trends. Here we report the effects of XTC-MIF on dispersed blastomeres rather than intact animal caps. Under these conditions, responding cells distinguish sharply between doses of pure XTC-MIF differing by less than 1.5-fold. Two different response thresholds have been found, defining three cell states. This suggests that XTC-MIF has an instructive effect. Notochord and muscle are both induced in the same narrow dose-range. Mixing treated with untreated cells does not seem to shift the dose thresholds, showing that at least some cells can stably record the received dose of inducing factor.\r"

  ".W": "The antigen CD10 (common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen), which is the zinc metalloprotease, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (also known as NEP or 'enkephalinase'), is expressed by acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, normal lymphoid progenitors, mature polymorphonuclear leukocytes and certain nonhaematopoietic cells. CD10/NEP hydrolyses several naturally occurring peptides, including the endogenous opioid pentapeptides Met- and Leu-enkephalin. In invertebrate organisms such as the mollusc Mytilus edulis, Met-enkephalin triggers inflammatory responses by inducing morphological changes, directed migration and aggregation of haemocytes. We report here that a structure related to CD10/NEP is expressed by M. edulis haemocytes and that abrogation of CD10/NEP enzymatic activity reduces the amount of Met-enkephalin required for haemocyte activation by five orders of magnitude. Similar results are obtained with CD10+ human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, indicating that CD10/NEP related structures regulate enkephalin-mediated inflammatory responses in organisms whose ancestors diverged approximately 500 million years ago.\r"

  ".W": "Telomere structure and behaviour is less well understood in vertebrates than it is in ciliates and yeasts (reviewed in ref. 1). Like all other eukaryotic chromosomes, those of vertebrates terminate in an array of a short repeated sequence. In vertebrates this sequence is (TTAGGG)n, as shown by in situ hybridization. In humans, these terminal repeats are heterogeneous in length, averaging about 10 kilobases in blood cells. Here we report the structure and inheritance of the terminal repeats present at mouse telomeres. The (TTAGGG)n tracts are many times larger than those present at human telomeres. Because of their constancy in length through somatic cell divisions, they are resolved as multiple discrete restriction fragments of up to 150 kilobases. Strikingly, this banding pattern is highly polymorphic within populations of inbred mice, suggesting an unusually high mutation rate. Indeed, although the banding pattern is inherited in a largely mendelian fashion, (TTAGGG)n tracts of new size appear frequently in family studies.\r"

  ".W": "Transport of the essential nutrient phosphorus--primarily in the form of orthophosphate--into cells and organelles is highly specific. This is exemplified by the uptake of phosphate or its close analogue arsenate by bacterial cells by way of a high affinity active transport system dependent on a phosphate-binding protein; this system is unable to recognize other inorganic oxyanions and is, moreover, distinct from the one for sulphate transport. The phosphate-binding protein is a member of a family of periplasmic proteins acting as initial high-affinity receptors for the osmotic shock-sensitive active transport systems or permeases for various sugars, amino acids, oligopeptides, and oxyanions. We report here the highly refined 1.7 A resolution X-ray structure of the liganded form of the phosphate-binding protein. The structure reveals the atomic features responsible for phosphate selectivity, either in monobasic or dibasic form, and the exclusion of sulphate. These features are fundamental to understanding phosphate transport systems and molecular recognition of charged substrates or ions in other biological processes.\r"

Here we report that a component of LTP not requiring the activation of NMDA receptors can be induced in area CA1. The component is dependent on tetanus frequency, requires increases in postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and is suppressed by an antagonist of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.\r"

In scid mice, when precursors for B and T lymphocytes reach the stage of development requiring expression of these surface receptors, a defective recombinase system aberrantly cuts and rejoins the receptor gene segments greatly reducing the efficiency of producing functional receptors. As a result, most scid mice have no detectable B or T lymphocytes. We have demonstrated that the scid defect is not specific to lymphocyte development. Myeloid cells and fibroblasts from scid mice show a marked increase in sensitivity to ionizing radiation, indicating that the scid mutation leads to an inability to repair DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation as well as interfering with rearrangement of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes.\r"

  ".W": "The potential use of monoclonal antibodies in immunological, chemical and clinical applications has stimulated the protein engineering and expression of Fv fragments, which are heterodimers consisting of the light and heavy chain variable domains (VL and VH) of antibodies. Although Fv fragments exhibit antigen binding specificity and association constants similar to their parent antibodies or Fab moieties, similarity in their interactions with antigen at the level of three-dimensional structure has not been investigated. We have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the genetically engineered FvD1.3 fragment of the anti-hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) monoclonal antibody D1.3, and of its complex with HEL. On comparison with the crystallographically refined FabD1.3-HEL complex, we find that FvD1.3 and FabD1.3 make, with minor exceptions, very similar contacts with the antigen. Furthermore, a small but systematic rearrangement of the domains of FvD1.3 occurs on binding HEL, bringing the contacting residues closer to the antigen by a mean value of about 0.7 A for VH (aligning on VL) or of 0.5 A for VL (aligning on VH). This is indicative of an induced fit rather than a 'lock and key' fit to the antigen.\r"

Here we report isolation of the corresponding mitochondrial import receptor gene, termed MIR1. The deduced amino-acid sequence of p32 shows roughly 40% identity with proteins of bovine heart and rat liver that have been suggested to be mitochondrial phosphate carriers. Haploid cells carrying a disrupted MIR1 allele were unable to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source but grew in media containing glucose, indicating that the MIR1 protein is essential for mitochondrial function. Compared with wild type, amounts of some mitochondrial proteins were markedly reduced in cells containing a disrupted MIR1 allele, whereas levels of others were unchanged. This indicates that yeast contains more than one pathway for protein import into mitochondria.\r"

  ".U": "91015339\r", 
  ".W": "The large subunit of RNA polymerase II contains a highly conserved and essential heptapeptide repeat (Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Ser) at its carboxy terminus. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are inviable if their RNA polymerase II large subunit genes encode fewer than 10 complete heptapeptide repeats; if they encode 10 to 12 complete repeats cells are temperature-sensitive and cold-sensitive, but 13 or more complete repeats will allow wild-type growth at all temperatures. Cells containing C-terminal domains (CTDs) of 10 to 12 complete repeats are also inositol auxotrophs. The phenotypes associated with these CTD mutations are not a consequence of an instability of the large subunit; rather, they seem to reflect a functional deficiency of the mutant enzyme. We show here that partial deletion mutations in RNA polymerase II CTD affect the ability of the enzyme to respond to signals from upstream activating sequences in a subset of promoters in yeast. The number of heptapeptide repeats required for maximal response to signals from these sequences differs from one upstream activating sequence to another. One of the upstream elements that is sensitive to truncations of the CTD is the 17-base-pair site bound by the GAL4 transactivating factor.\r"

Two recent reports have linked the elongation factor 1a (EF-1a) which is involved in protein synthesis, with the microtubular cytoskeleton. In situ hybridization has, however, revealed that the messages for certain cytoskeletal proteins are preferentially associated with actin filaments. ABP-50 is an abundant actin filament bundling protein of native relative molecular mass 50,000 (50K) isolated from Dictyostelium discoideum. Immunofluorescence studies show that ABP-50 is present in filopodia and other cortical regions that contain actin filament bundles. In addition, ABP-50 binds to monomeric actin in the cytosol of unstimulated cells and the association of ABP-50 with the actin cytoskeleton is regulated during chemotaxis. Through complementary DNA sequencing and subsequent functional analysis, we have identified ABP-50 as D. discoideum EF-1a. The ability of EF-1a to bind reversibly to the actin cytoskeleton upon stimulation could provide a mechanism for spatially and temporally regulated protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells.\r"

This 'flock' has attracted attention because of the possibility that it evolved within the lake from one ancestral species and that biologists are thus presented with a case of explosive evolution. Within the past decade, however, morphology has increasingly emphasized the view that the flock may be polyphyletic. We sequenced up to 803 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA from 14 representative Victorian species and 23 additional African species. The flock seems to be monophyletic, and is more akin to that from Lake Malawi than to species from Lake Tanganyika; in addition, it contains less genetic variation than does the human species, and there is virtually no sharing of mitochondrial DNA types among species. These results confirm that the founding event was recent.\r"

  ".W": "The sensation of depth that is obtained with human binocular vision results from the differences in the projection of the world onto the two retinae. The process entails solving the problem of stereo correspondence, which involves choosing the correct matches between left and right image features. Many computational models of stereo vision assume a uniqueness constraint on stereo matching-that is, each feature identified in one image should eventually be matched with only one feature in the other image. This constraint would seem to be justified, as allowing non-unique matches would be tantamount to supposing that the scene entities to which matches relate are in two places at once. The value of the uniqueness constraint for eliminating false matches has been demonstrated in a variety of stereo algorithms. Yet on the basis of psychophysical results Weinshall concluded that it was not used by humans in dealing with certain types of ambiguous random-dot stereograms. We have now tested how Weinshall's stereograms are dealt with by PMF, a stereo algorithm which uses a unique-matches selection procedure in conjunction with a purely local similar-disparity support scheme. We found that PMF produces results that are closely analogous to the psychophysical results. This suggests that Weinshall's experiments should not be interpreted as evidence that the human stereo mechanism establishes non-unique matches.\r"

  ".W": "The failure of lesioned axons to regenerate over long distances in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is not due to an inability of central neurons to regenerate, but rather to the non-permissive nature of the CNS tissue environment. Regenerating CNS axons, which grow well within a peripheral nerve, for example, fail to penetrate mature CNS tissue by more than about 1 mm. Recent evidence indicates that this may be due to inhibitory membrane proteins associated with CNS oligodendrocytes and myelin. We report here that human telencephalic neuroblasts implanted into the excitotoxically lesioned striatum of adult rats can escape or neutralize this inhibitory influence of the adult CNS environment and extend axons along major myelinated fibre tracts for distances of up to approximately 20 mm. The axons were seen to elongate along the paths of the striato-nigral and cortico-spinal tracts to reach the substantia nigra, the pontine nuclei and the cervical spinal cord, which are the normal targets for the striatal and cortical projection neurons likely to be present in these implants.\r"

  ".W": "Retinoic acid is a vitamin A derivative with striking effects on development and cell differentiation. Several nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), acting as ligand-inducible transcription factors, have been characterized and indirect evidence suggests that they have distinct roles. One of the most intriguing properties of retinoic acid is its ability to induce in vivo differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells into mature granulocytes, leading to morphological complete remissions. Because the RAR alpha gene maps to chromosome 17q21 (ref. 14), close to the t(15;17) (q21-q11-22) translocation specifically associated with APL, we analysed RAR alpha gene structure and expression in APL cells. We report here that, in one APL-derived cell line, the RAR alpha gene has been translocated to a locus, myl, on chromosome 15, resulting in the synthesis of a myl/RAR alpha fusion messenger RNA. Using two probes located on either side of the cloned breakpoint, we have found genomic rearrangements of one or other locus in six patients out of eight, demonstrating that the RAR alpha and/or myl genes are frequently rearranged in APL and the breakpoints are clustered. These findings strongly implicate retinoic acid receptor alpha in leukaemogenesis.\r"

The protein SEC14p is essential for transport of proteins from the yeast Golgi complex. Independent characterization of the SEC14 gene and the PIT1 gene, which encodes a phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein in yeast, indicated that these two genes are identical. Phospholipid transfer proteins are a class of cytosolic proteins that are ubiquitous among eukaryotic cells and are distinguished by their ability to catalyse the exchange of phospholipids between membranes in vitro. We show here that the SEC14 and PIT1 genes are indeed identical and that the growth phenotype of a sec14-1ts mutant extends to the inability of its transfer protein to effect phospholipid transfer in vitro. These results therefore establish for the first time an in vivo function for a phospholipid transfer protein, namely a role in the compartment-specific stimulation of protein secretion.\r"

  ".W": "A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the brain. The principal component of the amyloid fibril is beta/A4 protein, which is derived from a large membrane-bound glycoprotein, Alzheimer amyloid protein precursor (APP). Although the deposition of amyloid is thought to result from the aberrant processing of APP, the detailed molecular mechanisms of amyloidogenesis remain unclear. A C-terminal fragment of APP which spans the beta/A4 and cytoplasmic domains has a tendency to self-aggregate. In an attempt to establish a cultured-cell model for amyloid fibril formation, we have transfected COS-1 cells with complementary DNA encoding the C-terminal 100 residues of APP. In the perinuclear regions of a small population of DNA-transfected cells, we observed inclusion-like deposits which showed a strong immunohistochemical reaction towards an anti-C-terminal APP antibody or an anti-beta/A4 amyloid core-specific antibody. Electron microscope observations of the inclusion-carrying cells revealed an accumulation of amyloid-like fibrils of 8-22 nm diameter near and on the nuclear membrane. The fibrils showed a beaded or helical structure, and reacted positively with the anti-C-terminus antibody by immunoelectron microscopy. These results suggest that the formation of amyloid fibrils is an inherent characteristic of the C-terminal peptide of APP. The present system provides a suitable model for the molecular dissection of the process of brain amyloidogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Changes resulting in altered antigenic properties of viruses nearly always occur on their surface and have been attributed to the substitution of residues directly involved in binding antibody. To investigate the mechanism of antigenic variation in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), variants that escape neutralization by a monoclonal antibody have been compared crystallographically and serologically with parental virus. FMDVs form one of the four genera of the Picornaviridae. The unenveloped icosahedral shell comprises 60 copies each of four structural proteins VP1-4. Representatives from each of the genera have similar overall structure, but differences in the external features. For example, human rhinovirus has a pronounced 'canyon' that is proposed to contain the cell attachment site, whereas elements of the attachment site for FMDV, which involves the G-H loop (residues 134-160) and C-terminus (200-213) of VP1, are exposed on the surface. Moreover, this G-H loop, which is a major antigenic site of FMDV, forms a prominent, highly accessible protrusion, a feature not seen in other picornaviruses. It is this loop that is perturbed in the variant viruses that we have studied. The amino acid mutations characterizing the variants are not at positions directly involved in antibody binding, but result in far-reaching perturbations of the surface structure of the virus. Thus, this virus seems to use a novel escape mechanism whereby an induced conformational change in a major antigenic loop destroys the integrity of the epitope.\r"

The secondary structure of the group I introns has been confirmed by comparison of over 70 published sequences, by chemical protection studies, and by genetic experiments involving compensatory mutations. Phylogenetic data can also be used to identify tertiary interactions in RNA molecules. This was first done by Levitt, who predicted tertiary interactions in transfer RNA, which were subsequently confirmed by X-ray crystallography. More recently, sequence comparison data have been used to predict tertiary interactions in ribosomal RNA. We have searched a complete alignment of the core regions of group I introns for evolutionary covariations that could not be ascribed to classical Watson-Crick or wobble base pairings. Here we describe two examples of phylogenetic covariation that are most simply explained by postulating hydrogen-bonded base-triples similar to those found in tRNA. Genetic experiments with the Tetrahymena and sunY introns confirm the importance of these interactions for the structure of the ribozyme.\r"

Tissue recombination studies predict that the W gene is expressed cell autonomously, whereas the product of the Sl locus affects the microenvironment in which the stem cells migrate, proliferate and differentiate. The W locus encodes the protoncogene c-kit, a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor family. The haematopoietic growth factor SCF (stem cell factor) has been identified as the product of the Sl locus and a ligand for c-kit. Here, we report that SCF is expressed during embryogenesis in cells associated with both the migratory pathways and homing sites of melanoblasts, germ cells and haematopoietic stem cells. Both SCF and c-kit are also expressed in a variety of other tissues, including the brain and spinal cord, suggesting that the receptor-ligand system has additional roles in embryogenesis.\r"

Although several chemoattractants are known for broad classes of lymphocytes, such as T and B cells, the process by which lymphocytes of specific subsets, such as helper, cytotoxic or memory T cells, migrate to the appropriate sites remains obscure. Interleukin-8 is a chemoattractant for T cells and neutrophils and is a member of a superfamily of soluble molecules related by a conserved motif containing four cysteine residues. IL-8 and related molecules, including platelet factor 4, constitute the C-X-C class of the superfamily and a group of cytokines produced by haematopoietic cells constitute the RANTES/sis or C-C class. The roles of most of these molecules are not well known, although murine MIP-1 alpha of the C-C branch is a specific inhibitor of haematopoietic stem cell proliferation and some members of the C-X-C branch are neutrophil-targeted inflammatory agents. Here we report that the RANTES protein of the C-C class causes the selective migration of human blood monocytes and of T lymphocytes expressing the cell surface antigens CD4 and UCHL1. CD4+/UCHL1+T cells are thought to be prestimulated or primed helper T cells involved in memory T cell function. The preferential attraction of T-cell subsets by specific cytokines could in part explain how lymphocytes are targeted, and may provide insight into the workings of T cell memory.\r"

In this paper we demonstrate that founder cells forced to differentiate in a foreign segmental environment give rise to their normal, segment-specific clones of neuronal descendants, even in segments in which those neuronal phenotypes would not normally be observed. These findings indicate that the individual founder cells possess segmental identity at or shortly after the time of their birth, and further suggest that such identities are established by a mechanism in which the parent stem cell 'counts' mitotic cycles.\r"

By making use of reverse genetics strategies we have isolated eight overlapping complementary DNA clones from the same chromosomal region. The corresponding gene is expressed in retina, choroid and retinal pigment epithelium. The cDNAs encompass an open reading frame of 948 base pairs that is structurally altered in eight TCD patients with deletions, and in a female patient with a balanced translocation involving Xq21. These findings provide strong evidence that we have cloned the gene underlying choroideraemia.

We have recently isolated a candidate complementary DNA for the rd gene from a mouse retinal library and completed the characterization of cDNAs encoding all subunits of bovine photoreceptor phosphodiesterase. The candidate cDNA shows strong homology with a cDNA encoding the bovine phosphodiesterase beta subunit.

Treatment of cells with the antimicrotubule drug thiabendazole prevents cyclin degradation and blocks the tyrosine dephosphorylation and activation of cdc2. These results suggest a key regulatory role of the cdc2-cyclin complex in the initiation of mitotic spindle formation and also that mitotic microtubule function is required for cdc2 activation.\r"

  ".W": "The mating-type locus (MAT) encodes several DNA-binding proteins, which determine the three cell types of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the a and alpha haploid cell types, and the a/alpha diploid cell type. One of the products of MAT, alpha 2, functions in two cell types. In alpha cells, alpha 2 represses the a-specific genes by binding to the operator as a dimer. In a/alpha diploid cells, alpha 2 acts with a1, a product of the other MAT allele, to repress a different set of genes, the haploid-specific genes. Until now, the nature of the interaction between a1 and alpha 2 was not known, although it had been suggested that alpha 2 may form a heterodimer with a1. I show, by using proteins synthesized in vitro, that a1 and alpha 2 bind the operator of a haploid-specific gene as a heterodimer. The ability of alpha 2 to form both homodimers and heterodimers with a1, each with a different DNA-binding specificity, explains the dual regulatory functions of alpha 2. This is the first example of regulation by heterodimerization among homeobox-containing proteins, a class that includes proteins responsible for the specification of segment identity in Drosophila, mammals and other eukaryotes.\r"

  ".U": "91015391\r", 
  ".W": "Phospholipases A2 play a part in a number of physiologically important cellular processes such as inflammation, blood platelet aggregation and acute hypersensitivity. These processes are all initiated by the release of arachidonic acid from cell membranes which is catalysed by intracellular phospholipases A2 and followed by conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, leukotrienes or thromboxanes. An imbalance in the production of these compounds can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Inhibitors of phospholipase A2 might therefore act to reduce the effects of inflammation, so structural information about the binding of phospholipase A2 to its substrates could be helpful in the design of therapeutic drugs. The three-dimensional structure is not known for any intracellular phospholipase A2, but these enzymes share significant sequence homology with secreted phospholipases, for which some of the structures have been determined. Here we report the structure of a complex between an extracellular phospholipase A2 and a competitively inhibiting substrate analogue, which reveals considerable detail about the interaction and suggests a mechanism for catalysis by this enzyme.\r"

The X-ray crystal structure of MR, solved at 2.5 A resolution, reveals that the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of MR and MLE are remarkably similar; also, MR and MLE are about 26% identical in primary structure. However, MR has no detectable MLE activity and vice versa. Thus, MR and MLE constitute the first example of enzymes that catalyse different reactions, as opposed to mechanistically identical reactions on different substrates, yet possess sufficient structural and sequence identity that they are likely to have evolved from a common ancestor. The discovery that MR and MLE catalyse different reactions but share a common structural framework has broad implications for the natural evolution of enzymes and metabolic pathways, as well as for the rational modification of enzyme activities.\r"

This new finding is considered in the context of previous clinical and experimental data on the various types of ocular tilt reactions that follow stimulation or destruction of the peripheral and central vestibular system. Otolithic inputs to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal from the contralateral vestibular nucleus and motor outputs from the interstitial nucleus of Cajal to cervical and ocular motoneurons could be involved in the ocular tilt reaction. We propose that in patients with unilateral meso-diencephalic lesions, a tonic contraversive ocular tilt reaction could be due to persistently decreased resting activity of ipsilateral interstitial nucleus neurons, whereas a paroxysmal ipsiversive ocular tilt reaction could be due to transiently increased activity of the same interstitial nucleus neurons. Cases of ocular tilt reaction due to unilateral meso-diencephalic lesion point to the existence of a crossed graviceptive pathway between the vestibular nucleus and the contralateral interstitial nucleus of Cajal.\r"

Because dementia may affect survival in PD, the incidence rate of dementia, rather than proportion, would be a more accurate measure of disease frequency. We previously estimated the proportion of patients with PD and dementia to be 10.9% from the records of a cohort with the idiopathic form of PD in a major medical center. We reviewed the clinical records of this cohort after 4 years and 9 months to estimate the incidence rate of dementia. We identified 65 new cases of dementia from the 249 patient-records available. Using the number of person-years of follow-up for each case as the denominator, we estimated the overall incidence rate to be 69 per 1,000 person-years of observation. The mean age of this cohort was 71.4 years. The cumulative incidence of dementia increased with age. By 85 years of age, over 65% of the surviving members of the cohort were demented. The age-specific incidence rates for dementia in this cohort of PD were significantly greater than for a similarly aged cohort of healthy elderly people. The age-specific standard morbidity ratios indicated that, compared with people of similar ages, patients with PD have the highest increase in risk for dementia between ages 65 and 75.\r"

We recorded the clinical data on a standardized form; the subjects' identity and clinical and pathologic diagnoses were omitted. Each physician diagnosed each case according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. We calculated the inter-rater agreement for all possible 2-way combinations of clinicians with the Kappa statistic, which ranged from 0.36 (fair agreement) to 0.65 (substantial agreement).

The 6 patients with DLBD included 3 with neocortical neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) consistent with coincident AD. Most patients with DLBD had gait impairment concurrent with mild to moderate dementia. Abnormalities of tone or resting tremor were also prominent early symptoms in the subjects with DLBD, but not AD. Patients with DLBD frequently had abnormal EEGs with background posterior slowing and a frontally dominant burst pattern at the time of mild to moderate dementia. Agitation, hallucinations, and delusions were frequent early symptoms in DLBD patients. Patients with DLBD without concomitant AD had numerous Alz-50 negative cortical plaques. Patients with DLBD have a distinct clinical syndrome that can be differentiated from AD. Pathologic features, including the absence of Alz-50 immunoreactivity, also differentiate DLBD from AD.\r"

Early-onset PD patients functioned cognitively better than late-onset PD patients. Bradykinesia, and postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), were more common at onset in patients with a rapid rate of disease progression (\"malignant PD\"; duration of symptoms less than 1 year and Hoehn/Yahr stage of 2.5, N = 11) as compared with those with a relatively slow rate of progression (\"benign PD\"; duration of symptoms greater than 4 years, N = 65).

The PIGD group reported significantly greater subjective intellectual, motor, and occupational impairment than the tremor group. Stage II patients had higher depression scores than stage I patients. Among the patients participating in the DATATOP, older age at onset with bradykinesia, or with the PIGD form of PD, is associated with more functional disability than when the symptoms are dominated by tremor or begin at a younger age.\r"

We further studied a brain isolate for its plasmid DNA content and its response in vitro to immune sera and antibiotics. One strain of B burgdorferi, N40, was consistently infective for mice, and resulted in chronic infection of the bladder and spleen. SJL mice developed fewer culture-positive organs and had lower antibody titers than Balb/c and C57Bl/6 mice. Organism was cultured from the brain early in the course of infection, and this isolate, named N40Br, was further studied in vitro. The plasmid content of N40Br was different from that of the infecting strain, implying either a highly selective process during infection or DNA rearrangement in the organism in vivo. N40Br was very sensitive to antibiotics, but only after prolonged incubation. Immune sera from both mice and humans infected with B burgdorferi were unable to completely kill the organism by complement-mediated cytotoxicity. These data demonstrate that B burgdorferi infects the brain of experimental animals, and is resistant to immune sera in vitro but sensitive to prolonged treatment with antibiotics.\r"

We compared clinical and angiographic features of 24 white and 24 Chinese patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease. In symptomatic vascular territories, whites had more severe (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis) extracranial lesions, while Chinese had more severe intracranial lesions. When we counted mild and severe lesions in a symptomatic territory, whites had more extracranial lesions while Chinese had more intracranial lesions. When we combined symptomatic and asymptomatic territories, whites had more extracranial lesions, while Chinese had more intracranial lesions. White patients reported more transient ischemic attacks. The distribution of lesions, however, was not explained by differences in incidence of transient ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or ischemic heart disease between the groups. The preponderance of intracranial vascular lesions in Chinese patients is similar to that seen in blacks and Japanese. Racial differences in the occurrence of extracranial and intracranial lesions raise the possibility of a different underlying pathophysiology for the 2 locations.\r"

Seven of 11 patients surviving for more than 2 months after tumor therapy showed substantial neurologic improvement (1 patient being in complete remission at 7 years); in 3 of 11 improvement was transient. An EMG index of disease severity (compound muscle action potential amplitude in abductor digiti minimi) was significantly increased at final follow-up (p less than 0.01; n = 11). A pretreatment amplitude greater than 3.0 mV was a good prognostic sign. We conclude that a combined treatment approach in SCC-LEMS usually results in neurologic improvement.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) between 13 men with clinically and electrographically documented temporal lobe seizures and 8 age-matched controls. Serum for LH measurement was drawn every 15 minutes during 8 hours of EEG telemetry in both groups. The 2 groups did not differ significantly in average mean baseline LH secretion, total LH secretion, or average pulse amplitude. The group with seizures, however, showed a significantly greater (p less than 0.05) variability of baseline LH secretion and pulse frequency. Among the men with unilateral paroxysmal EEG findings, pulse frequency was significantly greater (p = 0.05) with right epileptiform discharges or left slowing (6.4 +/- 0.4) than with left epileptiform discharges or right slowing (3.0 +/- 1.3). The relationship of pulse frequency to the nature and laterality of paroxysmal discharges makes it unlikely that endocrine abnormalities can be attributed to medication alone and strengthens the notion that temporal lobe epileptiform discharges may disrupt hypothalamic regulation of pituitary secretion.\r"

Surface EMG showed relatively rhythmic discharge at a rate of about 9 Hz, which resembled essential tremor. However, electrophysiologic studies revealed giant somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with enhanced long-loop reflex and premovement cortical spike by the jerk-locked averaging method. Treatment with beta-blocker showed no effect, but anticonvulsants such as clonazepam, valproate, and primidone were effective to suppress the tremor and the amplitude of SEPs. We call this involuntary movement \"cortical tremor,\" which is in fact a variant of cortical reflex myoclonus.\r"

Quantitative analysis of spectrally analyzed EEG revealed focal abnormality in 7 patients whose conventional EEG was interpreted as either normal or diffusely slow. However, focal paroxysmal spikes present in the EEG of 1 patient were missed by EEG mapping, and a false localization of quantitative EEG abnormality contralateral to the lesion occurred in 1 patient. Topographic analysis of the PVEP was no more sensitive to retrochiasmatic lesions than conventional analysis of 2 lateral occipital electrodes. We conclude that topographic mapping is a valid technique in the detection of localized cerebral lesions.\r"

We therefore reviewed the literature on dystonic manifestations in autopsy-proven cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Only 6 of 140 autopsy reports of MSA remarked on the presence of dystonia in life, but personal observations suggest prominent antecollis may develop at some stage in up to 1/2 of sufferers. Similarly, very few (15/118) clinicopathologic observations on PSP included convincing dystonic manifestations, in contrast to some clinical reports where blepharospasm and early limb dystonia were prominent. Virtually any form of focal and segmental dystonia may sometimes occur with clinically diagnosed PD, with occasional descriptions of hemidystonia-hemiparkinsonism. However, there is pathologic confirmation of this diagnosis in only 1 case. With many patients thought clinically to have PD proving pathologically to have another cause for their parkinsonism, the true frequency and the range of dystonic manifestations acceptable in PD remain unknown.\r"

Between attacks, migraineurs (notably with aura) had substantially higher plasma Glu and Asp levels than did controls and tension headache patients. In addition, patients with migraine without aura showed low plasma histidine levels. During migraine attacks, Glu (and to a lesser extent Asp) levels were even further increased. The results suggest a defective cellular reuptake mechanism for Glu and Asp in migraineurs, and we hypothesize a similar defect at the neuronal/glial cell level, predisposing the brain of migraineurs to develop spreading depression.\r"

Twenty-four of the patients had had TIAs or amaurosis fugax from 1 to 60 days before PET; all had normal brain CT. We used a stereotactic localization method to locate the anterior and posterior borderzone regions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. We then calculated ratios of each borderzone to the ipsilateral MCA territory for both rt and rOEF. There was no significant difference from control ratios in any patient subgroup including those with greater than or equal to 75% stenosis or occlusion, those with or without contralateral greater than or equal to 50% stenosis, or those with abnormal hemodynamics in the MCA territory. We therefore found no evidence for selective borderzone hemodynamic impairment in this group of patients with severe carotid artery disease.\r"

In 12 patients with active diffuse CNS-SLE presenting with delirium (4), organic personality syndrome (3), or generalized seizures (5), we determined the CSF indexes of the complement components C3, C4, and factor B, and of IgG, IgA, and IgM. There was a significant increase of the C4 index in these patients compared with controls and a significantly higher CSF C4 index in patients with an increased IgM index.

The approach is especially useful in epidemiologic and controlled clinical trials. We studied which algorithm of testing and finding threshold should be used in automatic systems by comparing among algorithms and stimulus conditions for the index finger of healthy subjects and for the great toe of patients with mild neuropathy. Appearance thresholds obtained by linear ramps increasing at a rate less than 4.15 microns/sec provided accurate and repeatable thresholds compared with thresholds obtained by forced-choice testing. These rates would be acceptable if only sensitive sites were studied, but they were too slow for use in automatic testing of insensitive parts. Appearance thresholds obtained by fast linear rates (4.15 or 16.6 microns/sec) overestimated threshold, especially for sensitive parts. Use of the mean of appearance and disappearance thresholds, with the stimulus increasing exponentially at rates of 0.5 or 1.0 just noticeable difference (JND) units per second, and interspersion of null stimuli, Bekesy with null stimuli, provided accurate, repeatable, and fast estimates of threshold for sensitive parts. Despite the good performance of Bekesy testing, we prefer forced choice for evaluation of the sensation of patients with neuropathy.\r"

Free radicals are capable of reacting almost instantaneously with membrane lipids and causing lipid peroxidation, membrane injury, and cell death. Dopamine is metabolized by oxidation reactions capable of generating free radicals. Recent evidence indicates that the substantia nigra of patients with PD contains increased iron, which enhances oxidation, and decreased glutathione, which protects against the formation of free radicals. Further, the end products of lipid peroxidation are increased in the substantia nigra of patients with PD, supporting the notions that free radicals are being generated and may contribute to dopamine neuronal death. This hypothesis suggests that antioxidant therapies may slow the rate of progression of PD and raises concern that metabolites of levodopa therapy may accelerate the rate of neuronal degeneration.\r"

We administered intravenous clonidine (an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist) and yohimbine (an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist) to nine menopausal women with hot flushes and to an asymptomatic comparison group. Hot flushes were defined objectively by skin conductance responses recorded from the sternum; finger temperature recordings and symptom reports were also evaluated. The subjects were prescreened using ambulatory skin conductance monitoring. A significantly greater number of hot flushes occurred during yohimbine sessions than in corresponding placebo sessions (six versus zero). Clonidine significantly increased the amount of peripheral heating needed to provoke a hot flush (40.6 versus 33.6 minutes) and reduced the number of hot flushes that did occur (two versus eight). No hot flushes occurred in the asymptomatic women. These findings support the role of a central alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism in the initiation of hot flushes.\r"

This multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluated the lowest effective daily dose of estrone sulfate (0.3, 0.625, or 1.25 mg) combined with 1000 mg elemental calcium supplementation for preventing bone loss in the immediate supplementation for preventing bone loss in the immediate postmenopausal period. Spinal bone mineral density was measured using quantitative computed tomography. Compared with baseline, bone mineral density increased significantly (P less than .05) after 12 months of 0.625 mg daily (+ 1.9%) or 1.25 mg daily (+ 2.5%). The difference between the 0.625-mg and 1.25-mg doses was not statistically significant. Estrone sulfate administration (0.625 and 1.25 mg) produced significant changes in various lipid measurements at both the 6- and 12-month observation points. The prevalence rates for adverse events were comparable among the estrone sulfate groups and the placebo group. Estrone sulfate 0.625 mg daily, combined with 1000 mg elemental calcium supplementation, was the minimum effective dosage to prevent loss of spinal bone mineral density in postmenopausal women over a 12-month period.\r"

  ".W": "Because the long-term effects of estrogen replacement in adolescents with ovarian failure and hypothalamic amenorrhea have not been previously studied, we conducted a 2-year study of 35 patients to determine factors contributing to baseline bone density measures (bone density, bone mineral content, and bone width) and the response to estrogen therapy. Estrogen-deficient patients were often profoundly osteopenic by single-photon absorptiometry of the radius and dual-photon absorptiometry of the spine, despite estrogen replacement. Variables that were significant predictors of better initial single-photon absorptiometry measurements included increased age, increased body mass index, spontaneous pubertal development, lack of radiation therapy, and lower serum osteocalcin. Patients treated with estrogen/progestin had stable cortical bone mineral content and bone density at the distal one-third of the radius, a slight improvement in bone density at the distal one-tenth of the radius, and on encouraging, but marginal, improvement in the z score (standard deviation from the mean) of bone mineral content at the distal one-tenth. The z scores for cortical bone width and bone density decreased, suggesting a possible relative worsening over time. In untreated estrogen-deficient girls, bone mineral content and bone density decreased (but not significantly); the z score of cortical bone width showed a significant decrease. Using dual-photon absorptiometry, a history of radiation therapy was found to be a predictor of lower bone density compared with age-matched controls. Estrogen progestin therapy did not result in changes in serum levels of lipids and antithrombin III, weight, or blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-one consecutive postoperative obstetric and gynecologic patients with abdominal incisions that had opened because of infection, hematoma, or seroma and had intact fascia participated in the study. All wounds were first managed identically, with surgical drainage and debridement, for a minimum of 4 days. The patients then were randomized to either wound reclosure by a standardized en bloc technique (35) or healing by second intention (six). Reclosure was successful in 30 of 35 cases (85.7%). The mean time to complete healing was 15.8 days in successful cases, 67.2 days in failed cases, and 23.2 days for all patients who were reclosed. Failure to heal after reclosure was due to subcutaneous infection in two patients and seroma in three; these women were significantly heavier than those in whom reclosure was successful. There were no other major complications of wound reclosure. Patients randomized to healing by second intention required a mean of 71.8 days of wound care. The time to complete healing in the wound-reclosure group was significantly shorter compared with the group that healed by second intention (P = .002, log rank test). We conclude that en bloc reclosure of disrupted surgical incisions, compared with nonsurgical treatment, significantly decreases the time required for wound healing and has minimal morbidity.\r"

Preoperative diagnoses and clinical, surgical, and outcome variables were similar by route of administration for each surgical approach. Risk factors for infection after abdominal hysterectomy included younger age, lower postoperative hemoglobin concentration, and pelvic hematoma; women who developed infection after vaginal hysterectomy were heavier than those who remained uninfected and were more likely to have a pelvic hematoma. The overall incidence of major operative site infection requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy in evaluable women was 7.2%: 7.6% for 539 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and 6.3% for 207 women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy.

B72.3, which recognizes a tumor-associated glycoprotein, TAG 72, was injected 12-29 days preoperatively (intraperitoneally in four cases, intravenously in nine, and by both routes in one). Intraoperatively, the abdomen was surveyed with the probe and probe counts were correlated with biopsies and excised specimens studied by routine histologic stains. Probe counts were positive in four of seven evaluable patients with histologically confirmed disease. In three of these four patients, the probe detected cancer in specimens interpreted as normal on frozen histologic sections. The probe also identified microscopic cancer in the one patient who had no gross disease. The specificity of the probe was 70%. Preoperative computed tomography was normal in all patients, including those with tumors as large as 3 cm. This pilot study shows the ability of radioimmunoguided surgery to detect occult ovarian cancer.\r"

Because the predictive value of a positive aspirate approaches 100%, therapy for metastatic disease can be initiated in these patients with the need for an open biopsy. Among five aspirates in which malignant cells were not seen, the cellularity of the specimen appeared to be the critical factor determining the predictive value of the aspirate. Whereas neither of two patients with negative aspirates of adequate cellularity has developed recurrent disease, two of three patients with hypocellular negative aspirates have. Because a hypocellular negative aspirate from a retroperitoneal lymph node may not be a true reflection of disease status, either repeat aspiration or open biopsy is advisable.\r"

The subjects came from a randomized trial of sequential versus alternating combination chemotherapy. The overall median survival after second-look laparotomy was 62 months. Logistic regression analysis identified stage and hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy as significant prognostic covariates for second-look laparotomy outcome. Based on a Cox multivariate stepwise analysis, independent prognostic factors for survival after second-look laparotomy were secondary residual tumor size, pre-treatment histologic differentiation grade, and performance status. A high differentiation grade and a good performance status at the start of therapy thus still had a prolonging effect on survival after second-look laparotomy. The prognostic power of these pre-treatment variables was increased substantially by the addition of the secondary residual tumor size variable. The 3-year survival rate after second-look laparotomy for high- and low-risk patients was 15 and 87%, respectively. Second-look laparotomy thus provides prognostic information in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma, but the benefit in terms of survival is still unclear.\r"

One of 25 patients (4.0%) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy and radical hysterectomy had a microscopic ovarian metastasis. A literature review identified nine additional patients who had ovarian metastases and stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Including our series, the overall reported rate of ovarian metastases is 1.8%. All ten patients had at least one of the following additional characteristics: They were postmenopausal, they had adnexal pathology, or they had positive pelvic lymph nodes. Thus, ovarian preservation is warranted in premenopausal patients who do not have ovarian pathology or evidence of other metastatic disease at surgery. Bilateral oophorectomy may be performed if frozen-section examination of enlarged or suspicious nodes documents metastases. If the ovaries are left in the pelvis at the completion of the surgical procedure and microscopic spread to other pelvic tissues is documented, pelvic irradiation can be administered.\r"

The interval between onset of cancer symptoms and previous smear correlated directly with advanced stage. Sixteen women with normal smears within 36 months had significantly more advanced cancers than did 25 women with recent abnormal smears. Women with recent normal and abnormal smears had similar sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Because of inaccuracies in patients' self-reported smear histories and cancers developing in women with recent normal smears, we conclude that a specific screening interval should not be relied upon.\r"

In the early years of the study, conization was done by the cold-knife method (N = 201), whereas CO2 laser was used in the latter part of the study (N = 224). Success and complication rates were the same for the two methods. Abnormal cytology after conization was found in a total of 53 cases (12.5%), but a histologic confirmation of residual or recurrent CIN was made in only 27 women (6.4%). This corresponds to a success rate of 92% after cold-knife and 95% after laser conization. The CIN grading of the residual or recurrent CIN was similar to or less than the CIN diagnosis of the cone. Because our success rate was comparable to that of other series with much less strict referral criteria, our policy seems adequate.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of repeated cervical infections followed by a single direct tubal inoculation with Chlamydia trachomatis, serovars D and F, were examined in 11 pig-tailed macaques to test the hypothesis that tubal inoculation after cervical priming causes a more severe disease than primary tubal inoculation alone. Animals were cervically inoculated between two and five times. Fallopian tubes were inoculated with serovar D or F 1 week after the last cervical challenge. Three control monkeys received only one direct tubal inoculation without previous cervical inoculation. Infection was confirmed by isolating the microorganism from the endocervix in 13 of 14 monkeys and from the endosalpinx in four only after the tubal inoculation. Antibody was detected in post-infection sera of all 14. Tubal edema occurred in seven of 11 animals after the first cervical inoculation, and uterine erythema occurred in 11 of 11 after the second cervical inoculation. Peritubal adhesions were induced before the tubal inoculation in zero of seven given three or fewer cervical inoculations and four of four given five cervical inoculations (P less than .01). After direct tubal inoculation, peritubal adhesions became more prominent, and the 11 hysterectomy specimens showed plasma cell endometritis in nine and salpingitis in nine. Two control monkeys developed minor adhesions, the other none. One tube in two of three controls showed mild plasma cell infiltrates, whereas no evidence of endometritis was observed in controls. Histopathology in these monkeys was characteristic of chlamydial endometritis and salpingitis. However, the pathogenesis of these changes is uncertain because C trachomatis was not isolated from the endosalpinx after cervical inoculations alone.\r"

We retrospectively studied 33 patients from whom vaginal isolates of T glabrata were obtained. Torulopsis glabrata caused symptomatic vaginitis in 42% of the patients but was unassociated with symptoms in 30%; in 27% of patients, its importance was uncertain because of concomitant pathology. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed on 39 T glabrata strains isolated from 39 patients. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the majority of T glabrata isolates fell within the sensitive range of the antimycotic drugs tested; however, no correlation was found between in vitro antifungal MICs and the response to azole drug therapy. Clinical success was achieved in 67% of the patients although mycologic cure occurred in only 33%. A small number of patients developed recurrent and often chronic Torulopsis vaginitis unresponsive to conventional therapy. Limited experience suggests that vaginal boric acid therapy may be of value in these recalcitrant cases.\r"

Thirty-seven women with anogenital warts applied the solution to the surface of these warts twice daily for 3 days, followed by 4 drug-free days. A minimum of two and a maximum of four treatment cycles were given. The subjects were evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks and again at 6 and 10 weeks. At the end of 10 weeks, the mean number of warts per patient was reduced from 6.27 to 1.1, and half of the patients were completely cleared of warts. Only eight of 37 subjects (21.6%) developed new warts during the study period. Approximately 15% of patients reported \"severe\" local reactions to the treatment after the first treatment cycle, but this was reduced to only 5% by the last treatment cycle. During the same period, the patients reporting no side effects increased from 44 to 86%. The only woman who discontinued the study did so because of dizziness and epigastric discomfort, probably unrelated to drug use. Thus, 0.5% podofilox solution appears to be an effective treatment for condylomata acuminata, with acceptable side effects that are local and temporary.\r"

The treatment failure rate for women whose partners were also treated was not significantly different from that for women whose partners were not treated (6.8 versus 7.5%; P greater than .05), suggesting that treating genital condylomata in men does not affect the failure rate of cervical dysplasia in female sexual partners.\r"

Morbidity was seen most often in induced labor whether or not the membranes were ruptured for a long time.

The University of Utah Medical Center has a Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team composed of obstetricians, pediatricians, geneticists, and other health care professionals. These individuals are involved in the care of patients whose pregnancies are at risk for congenital malformations. An autopsy protocol was designed to increase the interaction of the pathologist with the Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team in the evaluation of perinatal death. Two years, 1982 and 1987, before and after the protocol was implemented, were selected for retrospective review. The autopsies in 1987 made more specific diagnoses compared with those in 1982. Additional congenital anomalies were diagnosed, and increased numbers of patients were found to have well-described congenital disorders. The number of attempted postnatal autopsy chromosome studies increased and more chromosomal abnormalities were detected. The final autopsy diagnoses made in 1987 have provided more information to the physician for genetic or other patient counseling. After the protocol was adopted, increased numbers of cases were referred to the Medical Center for evaluation at autopsy. More of those who came to autopsy had been evaluated during life by members of the Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team. Premortem sonograms had been done at an earlier gestational age and a greater number of anomalies were detected. Fewer of the fetuses had intrauterine death and more had pregnancy terminated by induction of labor. The gestational age at delivery declined.\r"

Group B streptococci were isolated from 18.4% of women at 23-26 weeks and 14.9% of women at delivery. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Gram stain were 28, 69, 17, and 81%, respectively, in mid-gestation and 34, 72, 18, and 86%, respectively, at delivery. The presence of gram-positive cocci on Gram stain was strongly associated with the isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis and with the presence of bacterial vaginosis. We conclude that most gram-positive cocci seen on Gram stain are probably anaerobes or micrococci and that the vaginal Gram stain is neither sensitive nor specific enough to be of use as a tool in the diagnosis of maternal group B streptococcal carriage.\r"

Blood samples for anaphylatoxin (C3a/C3a desArg and C5a/C5a desArg) and terminal C5b-9 complement complex determinations were drawn at delivery and 24 hours and 7 days later. Women developing HELLP syndrome had higher plasma levels of anaphylatoxins with delivery than did women with uneventful pregnancies. The plasma levels of terminal C5b-9 complement complexes at the time of delivery were increased as compared with levels 1 and 7 days after delivery in women with HELLP syndrome. The plasma concentrations of the anaphylatoxins and the terminal C5b-9 complement complexes returned to normal levels within 1 week after delivery in the HELLP group. The formation of C5b-9 complement complex indicates that the terminal part of the complement cascade has been activated and that C5a has been formed and eliminated. Complement activation with release of anaphylatoxins and terminal C5b-9 complement complexes may be one etiologic factor behind the elevated blood pressure, hemolysis, liver insufficiency, and platelet consumption seen in these patients.\r"

First-trimester oral glucose screening test values correlated significantly with third-trimester glucose screening test results for the entire population, for whites and non-whites, and for normal-weight and obese patients. First-trimester oral glucose screening test values at or below 110 mg/dL were seldom associated with third-trimester oral glucose screening test results at or above 135 mg/dL and were not associated with abnormal 3-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) results. Nine of the gravidas (7.3%) were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus during the third trimester, all of whom had first-trimester glucose screening test results above 110 mg/dL. The difference in incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus between gravidas having first-trimester glucose screening test results at or below 110 mg/dL (0%) and those having values above 110 mg/dL (16.4%) was highly significant (P less than .0001). For patients with first-trimester glucose screening test values at or below 110 mg/dL, third-trimester glucose screening may be unnecessary. In contrast, for gravidas having first-trimester glucose screening test results at or above 135 mg/dL, there is a high positive predictive value for elevated repeat glucose screening test results during the early third trimester. Patients having elevated first-trimester glucose screening values at or above 140 mg/dL are at particularly high risk for elevated glucose screening test results later in pregnancy and should forego repeat 1-hour third-trimester glucose screening in favor of a direct third-trimester 3-hour GTT.\r"

An extensive literature review revealed that our current understanding of the anatomy and pathogenesis of the syndrome has not changed over the last 3 decades. However, modern diagnostic modalities, such as sonography and Doppler studies, allow antenatal diagnosis and therefore may change the current definition of the syndrome. Based on these data, a new composite definition of the syndrome is suggested. This definition includes the following criteria: 1) sonographic signs (inter-twin differences in abdominal circumference greater than 18 mm, polyhydramnios-oligohydramnios, and signs of monozygosity), 2) Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical arteries (inter-twin difference in systolic/diastolic ratios above 0.4), 3) demonstration of a transplacental vascular shunt, 4) inter-twin birth weight difference of 15% or more, and 5) inter-twin hemoglobin difference of 5 g/dL or more. In addition, prenatal diagnosis may help in the management of this complication, and it seems that intrauterine treatment of the placental vascular anomalies may be more effective than other antenatal therapeutic options.\r"

The hand-held CO2 laser is a useful modality for removal of isolated large- and small-volume diaphragmatic disease, particularly if only the peritoneum is involved, and avoids the morbidity that may accompany entry into the pleural space.\r"

  ".W": "Among 235 women attending an outpatient clinic, the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was made using three of the following four criteria: typical discharge, pH more than 4.5, positive amine sniff test, and clue cells in a wet smear. These findings were correlated with the finding of clue cells in air-dried wet smears rehydrated more than 1 month after the visit. The rehydrated specimens had the same microscopic appearance as a nonpreserved wet smear. The demonstration of clue cells in the rehydrated smears correlated with the composite diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98%. In a busy multi-physician setting, the scoring of clue cells in stored and rehydrated smears can be used to obtain consistent readings for wet-smear diagnostics, thus simplifying teaching and increasing the utility of wet smears in clinical research.\r"

  ".U": "91016120\r", 
  ".W": "The rapidity of postpartum disease recovery for severe preeclampsia associated with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP syndrome) has not been well studied. Between January 1980 and March 1989, 158 pregnancies with preeclampsia-eclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome were managed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. The 70 patients with platelet nadir below 50,000/microL (class 1 HELLP syndrome) required as long as 11 days for all members to achieve a platelet recovery concentration of more than 100,000/microL, whereas all 88 gravidas with platelet nadir between 50,000-100,000/microL (class 2 HELLP syndrome) exceeded this platelet concentration by the sixth postpartum day, a statistically significant difference (P less than .0001). The interval between delivery and the onset of diuresis (mean +/- SD) was significantly longer in class 1 than in class 2 patients with milder disease (22.7 +/- 18.9 compared with 15.9 +/- 11.1 hours). Significantly more postpartum days were required in class 1 than in class 2 HELLP parturients for the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration to decrease below 500 IU/L (4.2 +/- 4.9 compared with 3.2 +/- 2.7 days). No women in the class 2 group required plasma exchange therapy to effect disease arrest and reversal, but 11 of 58 severely ill women in class 1 were treated with this modality. We conclude that the platelet count and LDH serum concentration, as indicators of HELLP severity and recovery, are clinically useful tools and that a more protracted postpartum recovery period should be expected for progressively severe expressions of HELLP syndrome.\r"

The mean blood pressure values, rates of development of severe preeclampsia, gestational ages at delivery, newborn weights, and 5-minute Apgar scores were similar in the aspirin-treated and the placebo-treated groups. We conclude that low-dose aspirin is not curative but is essentially a preventive treatment which, in order to be effective, should be started weeks before clinical signs of preeclampsia are present.\r"

Each live-born infant was assessed systematically by two independent examiners using a standardized checklist. There were 32 infants with minor congenital malformations (18.7%). There were significant differences in mean glycohemoglobin A1 between the group with minor congenital malformations and the group without congenital malformations at 12, 16, and 20 weeks, but not at 8 or 24 weeks. Logistic regression analysis showed that maternal age, race, gravidity, White class, duration of diabetes, maternal vasculopathy, and cigarette smoking were not significant variables correlated with minor congenital malformations. Because glycohemoglobin levels from 12-20 weeks are believed to reflect glycemic control from approximately 6-20 weeks, we conclude that poor glycemic control during late embryogenesis and early fetal development is associated with an increased risk of minor congenital malformations. We speculate that improvement of glycemic control during this period should decrease the risk of minor congenital malformations.\r"

Widespread use of vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery could potentially eliminate up to one-third of cesareans. However, many physicians have been reluctant to adopt this policy without large studies conclusively demonstrating its safety. This study evaluated the maternal and perinatal outcomes of over 5000 cases of labor after previous cesarean delivery. This multicenter study began in 1984 and initially included nine California hospitals. During the first 2 years, there were 1776 trials of labor resulting in 1314 vaginal births. In January 1986 two additional hospitals joined the collaborative project. Over the next 3 years, there were 3957 trials of labor resulting in 2977 vaginal births at the 11 participating hospitals. During the entire study period, 5733 patients opted for a trial of labor and 4291 (75%) delivered vaginally. There were no maternal deaths in the trial-of-labor group, and perinatal mortality was not significantly different from that of the general obstetric population. These results support the findings of numerous smaller studies that have concluded that the policy of routine repeat cesarean delivery should be abandoned.\r"

We determined the active pressure integral required per centimeter of cervical dilatation, expressed in kPa seconds, and the mean active pressure, expressed in kPa. The augmented group had a significantly higher mean active pressure integral per centimeter than those in normal labor (P less than .01). There was a trend, which did not reach statistical significance, for subjects who required oxytocin augmentation of labor to develop a higher mean active pressure than those in normal labor. However, the correlation of any uterine contractility index (Montevideo units, Alexandria units, mean active pressure) with progress in labor was poor. We conclude that women with dysfunctional labor require more uterine activity for progress in labor than women with normally progressing labor, and that the computer-derived \"area under the curve\" is not a better predictor of labor progress than Montevideo units.\r"

Our purpose was to document the extent of the contribution of unwed status to infant mortality and to compare unwed gravidas with their married counterparts. We hoped the comparisons would provide information that could be used for future programs of prevention. Our data encompassed a 10-year period (1977-1986) during which the incidence of infant deaths occurring in offspring of unmarried women was significantly greater than expected. The unwed population commonly consisted of younger, poorly educated, primigravid women who frequently did not seek prenatal care. We suggest that personal factors inherent in this group of women may be more operative than lack of access to perinatal care in determining pregnancy outcome. We believe our data underscore the need to redouble efforts to prevent unintended pregnancy.\r"

Fifteen of these patients seroconverted during pregnancy and 35 had a high initial antibody level in their first serum sample. Prenatal diagnosis consisted of a combination of ultrasound screening, amniocentesis, and funipuncture at about 20 weeks' gestation. Diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis was based on a positive toxoplasma culture of amniotic fluid or fetal blood and on the presence of specific immunoglobulin M antibodies in fetal blood. In addition, alterations in fetal hematology, cellular immunology, and fetal liver tests were indicative of infection. Fetal infection was detected in six fetuses; two died in utero as a consequence of the infection and four were born after 37 weeks' gestation. Despite antibiotic treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, one child has internal hydrocephalus and chorioretinitis and another has unilateral chorioretinitis. In the two other children, the disease is still subclinical. Of the 44 children born after a negative prenatal diagnosis, 35 have reached the age of 1 year; toxoplasma antibodies have disappeared in all of them. Investigation of the remaining nine children showed a decrease in toxoplasma antibodies, suggesting that none of them are affected. Prenatal diagnosis was never associated with fetal loss, and premature delivery occurred in only two cases. We conclude that prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis is safe and reliable.\r"

Both estrogen and estrogen-progestogen users had minimal increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, whereas non-users had significant increases in LDL cholesterol over time. Estrogen users had a nonsignificant increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, estrogen-progestogen users maintained premenopausal HDL cholesterol levels, and non-users had decreases in HDL cholesterol. Both estrogen and estrogen-progestogen users had increases in apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein AII, and triglycerides relative to the changes observed among the menopausal non-users. In summary, estrogen, whether administered with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate, could provide cardiovascular benefits to postmenopausal women by protecting against the atherogenic changes in LDL and HDL cholesterol observed among the non-users. With the exception of the hormone-related increases in triglycerides, the results are consistent with a beneficial effect of hormone replacement therapy on coronary heart disease risk.\r"

Centrifugation of the cell suspension yielded three major bands aggregating at the density interfaces.

The fraction of the 40-50% Percoll interface contained fibroblastic cells and secreted a small amount of PRL into the medium. Cells in the other fractions did not attach to the plastic dishes in 48 hours. Under the influence of progesterone (100 ng/mL), the cultured decidual cells retained their capability of PRL production for at least 10 days because no decline of the secretion rate was observed. The culture system established by the present study is satisfactory for investigating decidual cell functions, including the regulatory mechanisms of PRL production.\r"

Thirty aspirations were carried out under intravenous sedation with transvaginal ultrasound guidance. One or more oocytes were obtained in 29 aspirations (97%) for a total of 52 oocytes (average 1.7); 37 fertilized (71%), two were polyspermic, and 35 cleaved (67%). Seventeen aspirations (57%) yielded multiple oocytes. All 25 oocytes obtained from dominant follicles fertilized (100%), and 12 of 27 oocytes from secondary follicles fertilized (44%) (P less than .05 versus dominant follicles), with one polyspermic fertilization in each group. Sixteen cycles resulted in a single embryo transfer (ET), eight had two embryos, and one had three embryos transferred (36% multiple ET). Five clinical pregnancies (20% per ET, 17% per retrieval) resulted in four ongoing pregnancies (16% per ET, 13% per retrieval), all singletons. Our results suggest that in selected cases, IVF in unstimulated cycles may be a clinically viable alternative to stimulated cycles, with preliminary success rates in the range of national averages for stimulated cycles.\r"

Cells were grown in medium alone and in medium supplemented by 5, 10, and 20% concentrations of the cell-free fractions of peritoneal fluid obtained from patients with and without endometriosis. Nine fluid-sample pairs were matched based on the presence or absence of endometriosis at laparoscopy and the similarity of peritoneal fluid estradiol concentrations. Stromal cell proliferation as reflected by 3H-thymidine incorporation during sequential cell harvests over 72 hours was greater for cells exposed to endometriosis peritoneal fluid than for those exposed to non-endometriosis peritoneal fluid. This reached statistical significance with exposure to peritoneal fluid concentrations of 10 and 20% (P less than .05). A linear dose-response relationship between 3H-thymidine incorporation and peritoneal fluid concentration could be derived only for stromal cells exposed to fluid samples obtained from endometriosis patients (r = 0.51; P less than .001). In addition, proliferation over 72 hours was significantly greater for cells grown in 20% endometriosis peritoneal fluid than for those grown in nutrient medium alone (P less than .001). These data imply that factor(s) secreted into the peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients may play a role in the proliferation or maintenance of disease implants.\r"

Patients randomly assigned to four groups received topical bupivacaine hydrochloride on both fallopian tubes, the right tube only, or the left tube only, or received none (controls). A unique study design was incorporated which allowed the untreated fallopian tube to serve as a within-subject control for each patient receiving unilateral treatment. Statistical analysis confirmed significant benefit when both fallopian tubes were treated as compared with no treatment (P less than .05). There was also consistent evidence of decreased immediate postoperative pain perception on the treated side for patients receiving unilateral treatment.

Its safety during pregnancy has not been studied adequately. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of pseudoephedrine on uterine and fetal Doppler blood flows. Twelve healthy pregnant women between 26-40 weeks' gestation ingested a standard 60-mg dose of pseudoephedrine. A pulsed Doppler system was used to perform blood flow measurements of the uterine arcuate artery, fetal aorta, and umbilical artery before dosing, immediately thereafter, and at 15-minute intervals during the first 3 hours after drug ingestion. Blood flow velocities were not altered significantly after dosing in either the maternal or fetal circulation. In no case did absolute fetal or uterine blood flow velocities decrease significantly or systolic/diastolic ratios persistently elevate to abnormal values. We conclude that no significant alterations in the uterine or fetal circulations occur after the ingestion of a single dose of oral pseudoephedrine by healthy pregnant patients in the third trimester.\r"

A statistically significant (P less than .01) decrease in the systolic-diastolic ratio was found in the flow velocity waveform from the uterine artery, but no change was seen in that from the arcuate artery. No changes were observed in the fetal heart rate pattern or in umbilical or thoracic aortic flow velocity waveforms. Nifedipine concentrations in the mother had no correlation with maternal or fetal hemodynamic responses. At delivery 2.5 hours after nifedipine ingestion, the umbilical venous-maternal ratio of nifedipine concentrations was 0.76.\r"

The second trimester was characterized by an FHR pattern showing minimal differences between quiet and active intervals of fetal behavior. Few movements were accompanied by accelerations of small magnitude. Brief decelerations of variable magnitude exceeded the number of accelerations, and their frequency declined with advancing maturity. The percentage of body movements accompanied by FHR acceleration, the amplitude of these accelerations, and the rate of rise in heart rate increased with gestational age. Up to 30 weeks, the characteristics of the baseline FHR were similar in both periods of fetal rest and activity, with the baseline variability becoming significantly greater with advancing gestation. However, during quiet cycles of fetal behavior after 30 weeks, the baseline variability became progressively narrower, so that in late pregnancy different behavioral states could be determined reliably from characteristics of the baseline FHR alone.\r"

Compared with the general twin population, the tenth-decile group contained significantly fewer primiparas (P = .0023). Maternal obesity and diabetes were infrequent and could not explain the increased birth weight. The neonatal outcome was excellent. Although the comparison revealed insignificant differences, it is possible that the combination of higher parity, malpresentation rate, and male-to-female ratio may be operative in the genesis of large twins.\r"

In the present study, chorionic epithelial cells were incubated with group B streptococci isolated from either children developing sepsis after preterm PROM (complicated pregnancies) or from uncomplicated pregnancies. Incubation periods varied. The numbers of adherent bacteria per chorionic epithelial cell were counted by microscopic examination. After 70 minutes' incubation, the number of adherent group B streptococci in complicated pregnancies was 38, compared with 14 in uncomplicated pregnancies (P less than .001).

The increased risk for these events remained after controlling for age, race, and parity. We also constructed labor curves in DES-exposed women by plotting cervical dilation against time. The curves were similar for nulliparous DES-exposed women and nulliparous controls, but DES-exposed parous women experienced prolonged labors. These findings suggest that, in addition to the well-known adverse effects of intrauterine DES exposure, the interaction between the uterus and placenta is altered in some DES-exposed patients.\r"

The indicators were divided into two groups: those intended to identify morbidity and mortality and those intended to screen for appropriateness of care. Rates of actual morbidity and cases that failed to meet published criteria sets for hysterectomy were determined by chart review regardless of the presence of a quality assurance indicator. A total of 135 indicators were identified in 114 (44%) of the 257 cases, including 64 patients (25%) with morbidity indicators and 50 (19%) with appropriateness indicators. Actual morbidity was correctly identified in all 64 cases in which morbidity indicators were present. Three cases with significant morbidity were identified by chart review but not identified by the indicators, yielding positive and negative predictive values of 100 and 98%, respectively, and an overall accuracy of 99% for morbidity indicators. By contrast, 14 of the 50 cases in which appropriateness indicators were present actually failed to meet published criteria sets. An additional seven cases failing to meet criteria sets were identified by chart review and not identified by the indicators, yielding a positive predictive value of 28%, a negative predictive value of 97%, and an overall accuracy of 83% for appropriateness indicators.\r"

The internal and external anal sphincters could be easily delineated, as could the intervening longitudinal musculature, puborectalis muscle, anococcygeal raphe, anorectal lumen, vagina, uterus, bladder, urethra, coccyx, and pubis. The shape of the sphincters was nearly cylindrical, with an anterior component averaging 18.3 mm thick and 28.0 mm long. Fifty-four percent of this anterior thickness was attributable to the internal sphincter. The anorectal angle varied considerably, with a mean of 86.8 +/- 19.1 degrees (range 60-112). The angle between the portion of the rectal lumen supported by the anococcygeal raphe, or levator plate, and the plane of the puborectalis muscle was consistent at 149.0 +/- 6.3 degrees (138-154). The finding of anterior anal sphincters with substantial thickness and length contrasts markedly with a view often pictured in the literature of a female anal sphincter that narrows anteriorly to half its posterior length and forms a small bundle of muscle rather than a broad band. Knowledge of these relationships is important in primary repair of obstetric sphincter lacerations as well as in surgical correction of anal incontinence.\r"

In the Netherlands, population screening for cervical carcinoma is conducted on women aged 35-55 years. To examine the prevalence of asymptomatic cervical carcinoma and the way in which it was detected in different age groups, we studied the patients referred to our department. Among the patients younger than 35 years with cervical carcinoma, 20 of 70 (29%) were asymptomatic with disease detected by incidental screening, whereas eight of 177 (5%) in the group 55 years or older had been detected by incidental screening. In the age category 35-55 years, 54 of 160 (34%) were asymptomatic. Patients aged 35-55 years had undergone population screening or incidental screening. In the patients 55 years or older, asymptomatic disease was significantly less prevalent than in younger patients. Only one of the 66 asymptomatic patients in stage IB or higher suffered tumor recurrence. Among symptomatic patients, 25 of 136 (18%) with stage IB and 17 of 71 (24%) with stage IIA had tumor recurrence. Despite the favorable prognosis of patients with asymptomatic carcinoma, asymptomatic presentation could not be shown to be a significant prognostic factor, as were tumor diameter and lymph node status.\r"

Our study used a statistical model of meta-analysis to analyze the findings of 29 individual studies that looked at the association between the success of a trial of labor and various preexisting conditions. We hypothesized that various preexisting factors, including cephalopelvic disproportion, previous breech, previous vaginal delivery, more than one previous cesarean, use of oxytocin, and the length of labor and extent of dilatation in the previous cesarean, would affect the prediction of the outcome of a trial of labor. After determining odds ratios for the individual preexisting factors from the individual studies, we calculated overall odds ratios which incorporated the findings from all of the studies. For previous cephalopelvic disproportion, the odds were 0.5 for a successful trial of labor; for prior breech, 2.1; for women with a previous vaginal delivery, 2.1; for women who had had more than one cesarean, 0.7; and for women receiving oxytocin, 0.3. We were unable to analyze other preexisting factors because the data were not available, but short discussions of some of these other factors are offered. Even though the success rates do vary with the different preexisting factors, the clinician may anticipate a greater than 50% chance for success in any individual labor.\r"

Late-occurring wound sinus formation is one problem reported with the use of this permanent suture material. Over a 22-month period, 285 patients had midline incisions closed with a continuous, running no. 1 polyglyconate monofilament delayed absorbable suture. Closely spaced bites (about 1.5 cm apart) were taken and placed 2 cm lateral to the fascial edge. Over 60% of the patients had surgery because of gynecologic cancer. Other high-risk factors included obesity in 62%, diabetes in 19%, and previous irradiation or chemotherapy in 22%. An ovarian cancer staging procedure was done in 16% of the patients. Of the remaining patients, almost half had extensive operative procedures that ranged from exenterations to hysterectomies with lymph node dissection. Wound complications were noted in nine patients (3.2%). Seven had superficial infections, one had an evisceration, and one developed a ventral hernia. Wound sinuses did not occur. The closure technique is safe and expedient and distributes tension equally over a continuous line. It has the additional advantage of eventual absorption of the suture material, thereby avoiding the wound sinus problems occasionally reported with large-bore permanent sutures.\r"

However, rapid methods for detecting colonized women must be developed to limit the administration of antibiotics to those who are at risk of delivering an infected infant. The accuracy of a colorimetric test using starch serum medium on vaginal and rectal specimens from women with preterm labor or prolonged rupture of membranes was evaluated. The test was interpreted by labor and delivery room nurses without special microbiologic training. Starch serum medium results were compared with those obtained from routine cultures. Thirteen of 29 positive vaginal cultures (45%) and eight of 18 positive rectal swabs (44%) were identified by nurses using the rapid method. This was significantly different (P less than .001) from sensitivities of 93 and 95%, respectively, for the same vaginal and rectal specimens interpreted by a bacteriology technologist. The specificity for the test from both sites was 95% for the nurses. The sensitivity was 53 and 36% for vaginal and rectal swabs, respectively, for a subgroup of mothers whose infants were assessed as clinically septic. The low sensitivity of starch serum medium as interpreted by nurses in the labor suite is inadequate to allow the test to replace cultures in identifying women colonized with group B streptococci. Efforts to increase the sensitivity should be directed toward improving nursing staff interpretation rather than improving the medium itself.\r"

New techniques in assisted reproduction such as in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer, gamete intrafallopian transfer, and ZIFT increase the chances of pregnancy in patients with congenital cervical atresia. A hysterectomy, as advocated until very recently, should not, in our opinion, be the first treatment of choice.\r"

Histologic demonstration of ovarian tissue at operation confirms the diagnosis. We treated a patient with ovarian remnant syndrome with a 10-day course of clomiphene citrate, 100 mg daily, to stimulate the residual ovarian tissue and facilitate localization. Preoperative ultrasound revealed a 5.0 x 3.5 x 6.2-cm cystic mass in the right adnexal region. Exploratory laparotomy easily localized the mass, and it was removed intact. Histologic slides demonstrated normal ovarian tissue with multiple follicles in various stages of development and a corpus luteum cyst. Clomiphene citrate is capable of stimulating an ovarian remnant, producing an enlarged, cystic structure easily localized by ultrasound. The increased size and preoperative knowledge of the location facilitated surgical removal.\r"

Concentrations of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione were markedly increased in the ovarian vein serum, indicating ovaries as the source of these steroids. The serum concentration of hCG was 69 mIU/mL. Pulsatile secretion of LH persisted in spite of elevated hCG levels. Follicle-stimulating hormone levels were low or undetectable. Elevated hCG levels and low FSH levels resulted in a hormonal environment similar to that seen in polycystic ovary disease (high LH to FSH ratio), resulting in extensive stromal luteinization. Decline in hCG levels after removal of the tumor resulted in the return of androgen levels to normal.\r"

Six weeks later, computed tomography (CT)-directed drainage by catheter of a placental abscess was performed. Selective angiographic transcatheter embolization with gelfoam is a useful tool for the control of hemorrhage in the gravida who is an unfavorable operative candidate or who may present technical hemostasis problems peculiar to the placenta with abdominal pregnancy. Later use of CT-directed catheter drainage of the infected residual placental mass provided a nonoperative means of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A case of posterior urethral valve syndrome is presented. Four weeks after a normal 24-week ultrasound examination, diminished amniotic fluid, megacystis, and renal hyperechogenicity were observed. A repeat ultrasound examination at 30 weeks' gestation identified oligohydramnios and increased renal echogenicity. These findings prompted the performance of a percutaneous cystocentesis to assess fetal renal function indirectly. The specimen was evaluated for osmolality and sodium and chloride concentrations. The urine electrolyte concentrations (sodium 115 mEq/L; chloride 93 mEq/L) and the osmolality (230 mOsm/L) were elevated, suggesting impaired renal function and a poor prognosis. Despite these findings, aggressive management was used, including administration of antenatal corticosteroids and elective preterm delivery. A percutaneous cystocentesis was required during the infant's initial resuscitation, followed by a difficult urethral catheterization. Ultimately, a vesicostomy performed on day 4 of life was associated with prompt return of renal function (serum creatinine 0.7 mg/dL at the time of discharge). At 6 months of age, normal renal function has been documented and the vesicostomy has been closed. This case demonstrates the potential limitations of available prognostic criteria in evaluating fetal urinary obstruction and residual renal function. In selected cases (when the onset of obstruction is documented in the third trimester), refinement of these prognostic criteria may be indicated. Similar cases may be best managed by preterm delivery and prompt postnatal decompression.\r"

We present a case in which fetal ascites associated with complete heart block resolved promptly after administration of betamethasone and prednisone to the mother, who had anti-SSA and who developed clinical lupus erythematosus. This resolution occurred with no demonstrable change in fetal cardiac function. We conclude that an immune mechanism, rather than congestive heart failure, was responsible for the fetal ascites.\r"
