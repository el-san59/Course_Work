All patients were homosexual men with no other risk factors for AIDS. Two patients had sepsis only, two patients had sepsis and meningitis, and one patient had sepsis and signs of meningitis. Sixty percent of the cases (three patients) had a prior or concurrent gastrointestinal illness. Eighty percent of the cases (four patients) also had no prior history of antibiotic administration. Both of these findings may have predisposed these AIDS patients to be at increased risk for listeriosis. Although listeriosis is an infrequent illness in AIDS patients, people with AIDS or human immunodeficiency virus infection should probably refrain from ingesting food items associated with listeriosis. These food items include improperly pasteurized dairy products, and raw fruits and vegetables not properly washed.\r"

  ".U": "88103621\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may alter the course of coronary artery disease by influencing platelet and neutrophil function, arachidonic acid metabolism, and circulating lipid concentrations. To examine this hypothesis, placebo or omega-3 PUFAs as Max-EPA (equivalent to 3.2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid and 2.2 g of docosahexaenoic acid daily) was administered to eight patients with stable coronary artery disease and positive exercise stress test results in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion over a 12-week period. With Max-EPA administration, platelet aggregation threshold to epinephrine was increased in only two patients, but neutrophil aggregation and chemotaxic functions decreased consistently (both p less than or equal to 0.01 compared with preceding placebo phase) in all eight. Serum and platelet-rich plasma thromboxane B2 concentrations decreased 40 percent and 28 percent, respectively (both p less than or equal to 0.05). Neutrophil leukotriene B4 formation decreased 23 percent (p less than or equal to 0.01) and synthesis of leukotriene B5 became apparent in all subjects. Serum triglyceride concentrations fell 52 percent (p less than or equal to 0.05) without significant change in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations. Systolic blood pressure and the double product (heart rate X systolic blood pressure) were lower (p less than or equal to 0.05) at the end of the Max-EPA phase than in the preceding placebo phase. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the double product were also lower (p less than or equal to 0.05) at three as well as at six minutes of an exercise stress test, indicating a significant reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. Despite these alterations in platelet and neutrophil function, arachidonic acid metabolism, serum triglyceride concentrations, and myocardial oxygen demand, there were no significant changes in subjective parameters of coronary artery disease during the Max-EPA phase (angina frequency 3.7 versus 2.8 episodes per week, nitroglycerin consumption 3.0 versus 1.9 tablets per week, both p = NS). Similarly, exercise times to ST-segment depression (6.5 versus 4.1 minutes) and to onset of angina (5.4 versus 5.0 minutes) were not altered by administration of Max-EPA. Thus, short-term dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs to patients with stable coronary artery disease does not appear to alter subjective or objective parameters of myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six patients with diverse baseline right ventricular function were evaluated during incremental positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) application. Right heart pressures, cardiac output, right ventricular ejection fractions, and ventricular volumes were obtained at each PEEP level. Right ventricular peak systolic pressure-end-systolic volume relations were analyzed as an index of contractile function. Patients with severely depressed baseline right ventricular ejection fractions (30 percent or less) had an increase in end-diastolic (270 +/- 74 to 391 +/- 76 ml, 0 to 20 cm water (H2O) PEEP, p less than 0.05) and end-systolic volumes (210 +/- 70 to 321 +/- 70 ml, 0 to 20 cm H2O PEEP, p less than 0.05). These patients also had a decline in estimated right ventricular contractile function at 20 cm H2O PEEP as estimated by the slope of systolic pressure-volume relations (0.12 to 0.04 mm Hg/ml, 0 to 15 and 15 to 20 cm H2O PEEP, respectively, p less than 0.05). Patients with normal (40 percent or more) or moderately depressed (31 to 40 percent) baseline right ventricular ejection fractions had no change in right ventricular volumes or estimated contractile function. Therefore, the effect of PEEP on right ventricular function differs depending on the baseline right ventricular ejection fraction.\r"

With the exception of hypoprothrombinemia in those patients who did not receive prophylactic vitamin K, there was no difference in the incidence of side effects. In addition, no difference was noted in the incidence of superinfections or secondary pneumonias. When antibiotic costs, administration costs, and laboratory costs were considered, cefoperazone monotherapy was the least expensive antibiotic regimen. Cefoperazone is a suitable alternative to combination antibiotic therapy for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia.\r"

  ".U": "88103658\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin clearance was assessed in five normal subjects infused with insulin at a rate of 10 mU.kg-1.min-1 for 12-16 hours, which produced insulin levels of 1500-2000 microU/ml (approximately 10(-8) M). This level approximates the Kd of low affinity insulin binding sites, whereas previous clearance studies had been performed at insulin concentrations of 10(-9) M or less, approximating the Kd of the high affinity insulin receptor. The metabolic clearance rate for insulin during the infusion averaged 214 +/- 29 ml.min-1.m-2, which is half of that reported previously when lower insulin levels were achieved. Upon termination of the insulin infusion, the disappearance of insulin was markedly prolonged with an average \"half-life\" of 62 minutes. The rapidity with which hyperinsulinemia altered clearance suggested that down-regulation of insulin receptors was probably not the explanation for the reduced clearance. To elucidate the cause for the observed decrease in insulin clearance, five additional subjects were studied. If insulin was infused for 3.0-4.5 hours, the half-life of insulin disappearance was intermediate between that for an insulin bolus dose and that for a 12-16 hour insulin infusion. Administration of an insulin bolus dose at the end of a 12-hour infusion, while the insulin concentration was still approximately 10(-8) M, or 140 min later, when the insulin concentration was 10(-9) M, was followed by rapid disappearance with half-lives of 1.5 and 6-8 minutes, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The presence of a distal femoral epiphysis measuring 1 or 2 mm was associated with a gestational age of greater than 33 weeks in 87.0% of fetuses, whereas a distal femoral epiphysis measuring greater than or equal to 3 mm was associated with a gestational age greater than 37 weeks in 85% of fetuses. The proximal tibial epiphysis, which was absent before 34 weeks' gestation, was observed in 56% of fetuses at 36 weeks, in 80% of fetuses at 37 weeks, and in 100% of fetuses at 39 weeks of gestation. The presence of a proximal tibial epiphysis of 1 or 2 mm was associated with a gestational age of greater than 36 weeks in 88% of fetuses, whereas a proximal tibial epiphysis greater than or equal to 3 mm was associated with a gestational age of greater than 38 weeks in 94% of fetuses. The sonographic evaluation of distal femoral epiphysis/proximal tibial epiphysis can be used as independent markers for estimation of gestational age during the third trimester, a period in which standard fetal biometric estimates of gestational age are least accurate.\r"

The highest visualizing rate of the yolk sac in normal pregnancies was 97 at 7 weeks of gestation. A total of 130 miscarriages occurred before chorionic villi sampling. In these cases, the diameter of the yolk sac versus crown-rump length tended to be larger than found in normal pregnancies. The visualizing rate of the yolk sac in miscarriages after the embryo had been formed was significantly higher in those women who demonstrated fetal heart activity (82.1%) than in those who did not (54.5%). On the other hand, the yolk sac was observed in 44% of miscarriages without a visible embryo. These findings suggest different types of missed abortion.

  ".W": "A novel putative polypeptide hormone identified as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) was recently purified from islet amyloid (IA) of diabetic humans and cats, and also from amyloid of a human insulinoma. Although the function of IAPP is yet unknown, its occurrence in pancreatic endocrine tissue and its partial amino acid sequence identity with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) suggests an endocrine regulatory effect. In the present investigation, the authors utilized antisera to insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, synthetic human CGRP, and a synthetic human IAPP (7-17) undecapeptide to immunohistochemically (PAP technique) document the presence of IAPP immunoreactive cells in the islets of the cat, dog, mouse, and rat, but not in the islets of the horse or calf. In serial sections of islets from these species it was shown that IAPP immunoreactivity occurred in insulin-reactive beta cells. This observation was confirmed immunocytochemically in cat islets by means of protein A-gold probes. With protein A-gold labeling techniques, IAPP immunoreactivity was localized to the outer lucent compartment of the beta cell secretory granule, whereas insulin immunoreactivity was associated with the electron-dense core. These findings provide strong evidence that IAPP or an IAPP precursor is synthesized by beta cells and is stored in beta cell granules for subsequent co-secretion with insulin. The conservation of IAPP in humans and multiple animal species and the localization of IAPP to pancreatic beta cells provide further evidence that IAPP has an important endocrine regulatory function. The propensity of IAPP to polymerize and form IA fibrils in diabetes associated with aging may indicate that IAPP is in some way also linked to the development of Type 2 diabetes.\r"

In HS-immunized rats circulating antibodies that bound to renal basement membranes, an increase in serum creatinine (0.8 mg/dl versus 0.6 in controls P less than 0.01), and a 40% decline in creatinine clearance developed. In no animal did abnormal proteinuria develop. By histologic examination there was glomerular and interstitial capillary engorgement with erythrocytes, modest infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and no proliferation of intrinsic glomerular cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated deposits of rat IgG along the glomerular basement membrane. Bowman's capsule, and peritubular capillaries. Electron-microscopic examination revealed capillary engorgement with erythrocytes that appeared adherent to each other and contained entrapped areas of rarefied material. These observations demonstrate that binding of antibody to HS in the glomerulus induces a mild inflammatory reaction and a reduction in glomerular filtration rate, but no abnormal proteinuria.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocyte traffic into lymph nodes and into mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues is regulated by specialized postcapillary high endothelial venules (HEVs). The authors have produced a rat monoclonal antibody, HECA-452, that detects a human endothelial cell differentiation antigen selectively expressed on high endothelium. In immunoperoxidase studies, HECA-452 intensely stains all HEVs within lymphoid organs. In normal nonlymphoid tissues the antibody stains no vascular endothelium. The antibody, in addition to reacting with high endothelium, cross-reacts with a set of monocytic cells. In pathologic states such as autoimmune thyroiditis and Crohn's disease, known for the development of dense, frequently organized, lymphocytic infiltrates, HECA-452 detects HEV-like vessels containing luminal and intramural lymphocytes, presumably in the process of extravasating. The antigen was not expressed at detectable levels by venules in less heavily infiltrated chronic inflammatory sites nor in acutely inflamed tissues. In lymphoid malignancies, the only vessels stained were morphologically characteristic HEVs in association with areas of residual normal lymphoid tissue or reactive lymphocytic infiltrates. The specificity of HECA-452 for high endothelial cells confirms the highly specialized nature of these vessels and will permit studies of the regulation of high endothelial cell differentiation in vivo and in vitro. The HECA-452 antigen is preserved in paraffin sections of sublimate formaldehyde- and also routinely formalin-fixed tissues. Thus, HECA-452 will be widely applicable for the immunohistologic detection of endothelium specialized for the support of highly increased lymphocyte extravasation in inflammatory sites.\r"

  ".W": "Type I diabetes mellitus was induced in young, diabetes-prone BB rats by the passive transfer of concanavalin A-activated T lymphocytes from the spleens of acutely diabetic BB rats. The pancreas of the recipients was examined 1-2 days after the onset of glycosuria by immunocytochemistry by means of monoclonal antibodies for determining whether 1) Class I and/or II major histocompatibility gene complex (MHC) products were expressed on beta cells and 2) the mononuclear cell infiltrates were represented by T cells. Marked expression of Class I MHC gene products was evident on beta cells. In contrast, Class II MHC gene products were not identified on normal-appearing beta cells. Dendritic cells dispersed throughout the acinar and interstitial pancreas were markedly increased in number. The mononuclear cell infiltrate contained few cells (1-15%) recognized by a pan-T cell marker. Although it is possible that this passive transfer model might differ considerably from the spontaneously occurring diabetic state in the rat, this study suggests that 1) Class I, rather than Class II, MHC gene expression may be pivotal to beta-cell injury in diabetic rats, and 2) non-T cells may constitute an effector cell population central to beta-cell necrosis in Type I diabetes mellitus.\r"

In nonneoplastic tissues, MA immunoreactivity was present in skeletal and smooth muscle cells, in the pericytes of small vessels, and in the myoepithelial cells. Desmin immunoreactivity had a similar distribution, except that the pericytes of small vessels and myoepithelial cells were negative. All 17 rhabdomyosarcomas were positive for both MA and desmin. Of leiomyosarcomas, 31/32 were positive for MA, and 29/32 for desmin. In pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas (malignant fibrous histiocytomas) MA and desmin-positive cells were present in 9/35 and 5/35 cases, respectively. Three of five pleomorphic liposarcomas showed MA-positive tumor cells, which were also desmin-positive in one case. Desmoid tumors often showed a moderate number of both desmin- and MA-positive cells. Hemangiopericytoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and endometrial stromal sarcoma showed MA-positive staining only in the pericytes and not in the neoplastic cells. In various types of carcinomas, melanomas, and lymphomas, MA- or desmin-positive neoplastic cells were not identified. MA, but not desmin, was present in the desmoplastic stroma in many carcinomas. Both MA and desmin are good markers for muscle differentiation and especially serve to identify rhabdomyosarcomas and leiomyosarcomas. These markers are also present in some sarcomas currently regarded as nonmuscle tumors. This may suggest that some of these tumors have differentiation properties related to true myosarcomas. The absence of muscle actin, a pericytic marker, in hemangiopericytoma does not confirm the concept of pericytic nature of this tumor.\r"

Monomeric (mIgA) and polymeric IgA (pIgA) anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) were purified from MOPC 315 myeloma. A DNP-conjugated Ficoll was used as an antigen. For simulation of natural conditions of in vivo immune complex formation, 131I-DNP-Ficoll and 125I-IgA were administered through the intravenous and intraperitoneal routes, respectively. The kinetics half-life (t1/2) of the antigen (2.9 hours) and either the pIgA (7.2 hours) or mIgA (6.3 hours) in the experimental groups was not significantly different from the control. Glomerular IgA immune deposits were detectable only in mice that received pIgA and DNP-Ficoll. Plasma samples analyzed by gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed formation of large- and intermediate-sized pIgA complexes in circulation prior to glomerular deposition. Although mIgA failed to interact with such complexes in the circulation, it did bind to the pIgA immune deposits in the glomerulus. These results indicate that glomerular IgA immune deposits evolve from the localization of preformed circulating pIgA complexes that eventuates an in situ mIgA-mediated complex formation.\r"

  ".W": "With the development and routine use of real-time ultrasound scanning, it has been possible to collect 20 autopsy cases of infants in whom the ultrasound scan was first normal and then showed evidence of subependymal/intraventricular hemorrhage (SEH/IVH). Analysis of these cases with known postnatal origin of the hemorrhage permitted the development for the first time of a time scale to characterize the temporal evolution of the histopathologic reactions to hemorrhage in the premature human brain. This time scale was then used to define the histologic stage of the lesions in 27 other cases of infants who had a scan demonstrating SEH/IVH prior to death but who had not a previously normal scan. Only 2 cases were found to lie off the original scale, indicating a prenatal onset of the hemorrhage in about 5% of the total cases. Thus, postnatal events immediately preceding the onset of the hemorrhage are more likely to be implicated in the pathogenesis of SEH/IVH than prenatal or obstetric events. Comparison with similar reactions in the adult indicate that the early reactions by macrophages occur at about the same rate but the routine transfer of iron from macrophages to astrocytes and the much slower rate of absorption to form a cyst in the adult combine to form a complicated pattern that requires a different set of criteria for the intermediate and late stages in the adult.\r"

Research of the past two decades by developmental psychologists using an ethologically based theory of socioemotional bonds, however, is yielding findings that consistently confirm predictions. The author outlines this research, giving examples of the results, which are shown to be compatible with findings of epidemiological studies of depressed adults. He holds that a person's degree of vulnerability to stressors is strongly influenced by the development and current state of his or her intimate relationships.\r"

In spite of a number of methodologic limitations, the cumulative evidence strongly argues that there are more neurological signs in schizophrenic patients than in nonpsychiatric control subjects. Although less consistent, there is considerable evidence of more neurological signs in schizophrenic patients than in patients with affective disorders or with mixed, nonpsychotic disorders. The existing literature suggests several preliminary hypotheses with respect to neuroanatomical localization of neurological signs, subtyping of schizophrenia, and utility of studies of relatives at high risk and family history studies. Directions for future research in these areas are described.\r"

No difference in antidepressant efficacy was found between drug and placebo in the sample as a whole, which argues against the melatonin hypothesis of phototherapy. However, in three of the patients atenolol provided repeated, marked, and sustained relief of symptoms, suggesting that it may be useful in treating the winter depressive symptoms of some patients with seasonal affective disorder.\r"

The community obtained its water from two main reservoirs (A and B) and an auxiliary reservoir (C). Potable water was chlorinated but not filtered. The incidence of illness peaked approximately two weeks after the city began obtaining a major portion of its water from reservoir C, which had not been used for three years. The attack rate of giardiasis for residents of areas supplied by reservoir C was 14.3/1000, compared with 7.0/1000 in areas that received no water from reservoir C. A case-control study showed that persons with giardiasis were more likely to be older and to have drunk more municipal water than household controls. A community telephone survey indicated that over 3,800 people could have had diarrhea that might have been caused by Giardia, and 95 per cent of households were either using alternate sources of drinking water or boiling municipal water. Environmental studies identified Giardia cysts in the water of reservoir C. Cysts were also detected in the two other reservoirs supplying the city, but at lower concentrations. This investigation highlights the risk of giardiasis associated with unfiltered surface water systems.\r"

Campaigns which attempt to use fear as part of a punishment procedure are unlikely to succeed. Consistent with established principles of learning, fear is most likely to be effective if the campaign allows for the desired behavior to be reinforced by a reduction in the level of fear. This entails five requirements: 1) fear onset should occur before the desired behavior is offered; 2) the event upon which the fear is based should appear to be likely; 3) a specific desired behavior should be offered as part of the campaign; 4) the level of fear elicited should only be such that the desired behavior offered is sufficient to substantially reduce the fear; 5) fear offset should occur as a reinforcer for the desired behavior, confirming its effectiveness. Under some circumstances it may be difficult to ensure that these requirements are met. In general, a positive reinforcement approach may prove to be more effective than the use of fear.\r"

At the time of eye-opening, end-tidal isoflurane concentrations did not differ between subjects receiving morphine (0.20 +/- 0.02%) and placebo (0.18 +/- 0.01%).

With the animal in the prone position, elevation of the head from horizontal to 30 cm above the heart markedly decreased cisterna magna (PCSF) and dorsal sagittal sinus pressure (PCV). With the head elevated, compression of neck veins using neck tourniquet (pressure 40 mmHg) increased PCSF and PCV from 3.6 +/- 2.2 to 6.8 +/- 4.8 and -2.5 +/- 2.7 to 2.3 +/- 2.3 mmHg (mean +/- SE, P less than 0.05), respectively, while total or regional CBF and CMRO2 remained unchanged. Application of PEEP (15 cm H2O) increased right atrial pressure (-4.7 +/- 1.7 to -0.1 +/- 3.4 mmHg, P less than 0.05), but did not affect PCSF or PCV (3.4 +/- 3.3 to 3.3 +/- 3.7 and -3.5 +/- 2.6 to -4.1 +/- 2.4 mmHg, respectively, P greater than 0.05). Total or regional CBF and CMRO2 were also unaffected. These data demonstrate that, although neither maneuver affects CBF or CMRO2, neck vein compression elevates PCV above atmospheric pressure, but PEEP does not. In patients at risk for cerebral venous embolism, intermittent neck vein compression should be used as a prophylactic measure to prevent air embolism.\r"

During myocardial reperfusion a burst of oxygen-derived free radicals overwhelms normal cellular defenses. These radicals may have several detrimental effects. They can oxidize lipids, leading to membrane dysfunction. They can also alter nucleic and other proteins. Cellular dysfunction and death may ensue. Prevention of oxygen-derived free radical injury appears possible and may be feasible for several disease processes, including myocardial reperfusion after infarction.\r"

In a synthesis requiring 75 minutes, autologous neutrophils and macrophages from 40 mL of whole blood were labelled with technetium-99m-albumin colloid and administered to 100 patients with possible appendicitis. The entire process, from labelling the cells to completion of the scan took a maximum of 5 1/4 hours. Two patients had second scans on separate hospitalizations. Twenty-six patients had appendicitis; 12 had perforations, five of whom had an abscess. Eighty-five scans were read as either positive or negative for appendiceal pathology with a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 92%, and an accuracy of 92% in diagnosing appendicitis. Seventeen scans were indeterminant; eight of these patients had appendicitis. The value of the TAC-WBC scan in the evaluation of appendicitis lies in its ability to be used emergently, its high negative predictive value for men and women (NPV = 97%), and its high positive predictive value for men (PPV = 93%). At present, the scan does not appear to be reliable in diagnosing appendicitis in women (PPV = 43%). It is most useful in those patients in whom diagnosis is uncertain, and should not be used in patients with clear-cut appendicitis in whom its use will delay definitive surgical care.\r"

Plain and buffered solutions of the three local anesthetics were prepared, and a 0.5 intradermal injection of each was administered. Pain of anesthetic infiltration was rated from zero to ten. The area of anesthetized skin surrounding each injection site was measured at time intervals following each injection. Buffering the local anesthetics significantly reduced the mean quantitative pain estimates compared to the nonbuffered controls: 1) 1% lidocaine compared with buffered 1% lidocaine, 4.9 +/- 0.4 versus 1.1 +/- 0.2 (P less than 10(-6)); 2) 1% lidocaine with epinephrine compared with buffered 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, 5.1 +/- 0.4 versus 1.8 +/- 0.4 (P less than 10(-6)); and 3) 1% mepivacaine compared with buffered 1% mepivacaine, 5.1 +/- 0.4 versus 0.9 +/- 0.2 (P less than 10(-6)). Onset, extent, and duration of skin anesthesia were not statistically altered by pH buffering. The pain of local anesthetic administration can be dramatically reduced by buffering the local anesthetic prior to its infiltration. Anesthetic efficacy is not compromised, and patient acceptance may be significantly increased.\r"

  ".W": "In order to enhance subtle changes not apparent in resting ECGs by conventional criteria, a computerized signal processing technique, biopotential coordinate transformation (BCT), has been developed to increase the physician's perceptibility of CAD in seemingly \"normal\" resting ECGs. ECGs initially read as normal then can be tested with this process to predict the presence or absence of CAD. A blinded, retrospective study of 93 Caucasian patients with normal ECGs was performed using coronary angiography as the test standard. The BCT process identified the presence or absence of CAD with an 84.3% sensitivity and 81.8% specificity in 62 men. Similarly, a 76.2% sensitivity and 80% specificity was obtained for 31 women. These results suggest that the BCT process may provide the emergency physician with a noninvasive screening test for the detection of CAD in patients with apparently normal resting ECGs. Further studies are necessary for process refinement and verification.\r"

  ".W": "Patients presenting with elevated theophylline concentrations and manifestations of toxicity may be categorized as being either overdose or iatrogenic toxic. In addition to severe cardiac and neurologic toxicities, such as arrhythmias and seizures, OD patients probably require monitoring for manifestation of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypotension. The possibility of a delayed peak theophylline concentration after sustained release product ingestion must be considered. Patients with initial serum concentrations of less than 60 mg/L may receive a single dose of oral activated charcoal and have repeat concentrations drawn to ensure the avoidance of continued absorption. The presence of a serum concentration exceeding 60 mg/L in OD patients warrants initiation of elimination-enhancing modalities. Oral activated charcoal is the fastest and most readily available. Multiple-dose oral activated charcoal should be given until serum theophylline concentrations of 60 mg/L or less are reached. Cardiac monitoring and seizure precautions are recommended. Admission to the intensive care unit should be considered when serum concentrations do not decline after several hours of charcoal therapy or when seizures and severe cardiovascular manifestations occur. Patients having initial concentrations exceeding 100 mg/L and/or rapidly rising concentrations 100 mg/L over baseline values should be considered as candidates for CHP or RHP if available. If both CHP and RHP are unavailable or will be excessively delayed, HD is a reasonable alternative. Patients on chronic theophylline therapy (IA patients) presenting with symptoms of toxicity must be evaluated carefully. If serum concentrations are less than 20 mg/L, short-term observation or a reduction in dose should be sufficient. Patients with concentrations between 20 and 60 mg/L should be candidates for seizure precautions and cardiac monitoring. Oral activated charcoal may be started and continued until levels are below 20 mg/mL. Patients with concentrations in excess of 60 mg/L require intensive monitoring (including seizure precautions and cardiac monitoring) as well as initiation of MOAC or CHP/RHP as situation, availability, and patient tolerance dictate. Again, HD may be a reasonable alternative if the others are unavailable or contraindicated.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study has been to further define the pathophysiologic aspects of lung injury caused by the inhalation of endotoxin (LPS) using the morphometric approach to identify mediators that influence distal lung structure and function. Hamsters were divided into 3 groups 24 h prior to low dose LPS inhalation exposure (4 micrograms/m3 for 5 h): (1) pretreated with cobra venom factor to deplete complement in vivo, (2) pretreated with indomethacin to block prostaglandin production, and (3) untreated control group. Both pretreatments abolished LPS-induced decreases in lung volume as well as increases in capillary PMN and platelets seen in untreated control animals. Neither pretreatment had any effect on the LPS-induced decreases of other capillary leukocytes. Similarly, both methods of pretreatment failed to block increases in cellular interstitium of distal capillary septa induced with LPS alone. LPS provoked changes in capillary endothelium, especially seen as an increase in numerical density of endothelial pinocytotic vesicles. Decomplementation failed to alter this increase, but indomethacin pretreatment blocked the effect. Neither treatment had any effect on their size. Low dose LPS inhalation also altered pulmonary capillary permeability to a 125I-BSA probe, which was found in significantly greater amounts in LPS-exposed lungs than in those of saline aerosol control lungs, but was not present in the air space as evidenced by negligible counts in bronchoalveolar lavages. It is evident that endotoxin on the epithelial side of the air-blood barrier leads to changes on the other side of that barrier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88104882\r", 
  ".W": "Although synthesis of immunoglobulins by cells in the human lower respiratory tract has never been directly demonstrated, local production of immunoglobulins by cells within lung parenchyma is thought to play an important role in protecting the normal human lung against a variety of pathogenic organisms, and may contribute to the development of some interstitial lung diseases. To determine whether or not the epithelial surface of the human lower respiratory tract is a site of immunoglobulin synthesis, immunoglobulin production by cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage and lung parenchymal tissue from normal subjects and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or sarcoidosis was evaluated using a reverse hemolytic plaque assay and by measuring incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoglobulins. Although the reverse hemolytic plaque assay demonstrated immunoglobin-releasing cells to be present on the surface of the lower respiratory tract of normal subjects, and present in increased numbers in patients with IPF or sarcoidosis, these plaque-forming cells were not actively synthesizing immunoglobulins, since preincubation of lavage cells in order to remove immunoglobulin bound to the surface of the cells reduced the number of plaque-forming cells, and inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not further reduce the number of plaque-forming cells. Furthermore, direct evaluation of immunoglobulin synthesis using radiolabeling, immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis failed to detect de novo IgG production by cells recovered from the alveolar surface of 15 of 17 subjects, IgM by 17 of 17, and IgA by 16 of 17.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The lung clearance of inhaled and deposited 99mTc-DTPA is biphasic, with a very rapid initial clearance in premature infants with acute hyaline membrane disease (HMD). Infants who rapidly recover from HMD revert to a monophasic slower clearance rate prior to successful extubation. This raises the possibility that a persistently fast clearance might identify infants who will not recover and in whom bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) will subsequently be diagnosed. To examine this possibility, we reviewed our experience using this technique and identified infants who had subsequently developed BPD. These 8 intubated, ventilator-dependent, premature infants inhaled a submicronic aerosol containing 99mTc-DTPA on 14 occasions during the second, third, and fourth weeks of life. Clearance was biphasic, with very rapid initial lung clearance (T1/2 less than 2 min) on 5 occasions in 4 infants during their second or third week of life. The other infants had monophasic clearances that were much slower (T1/2 = 52 +/- 26 SD min). At Day 28 of life, all infants with BPD were ventilator-and/or oxygen-dependent. We conclude that lung clearance of 99Tc-DTPA is very rapid during acute HMD, but that it can normalize before 28 days of life in infants in whom BPD is subsequently diagnosed.\r"

We performed a decision analysis to address the issue of whether adults 20 to 80 yr of age should take isoniazid to prevent the development of active disease. The analysis uses a Markov simulation, a regression model to calculate the risk of developing tuberculosis at any given time after the discovery of a positive skin test, and estimates from the literature for other probabilities. The analysis favors withholding INH for all age groups, but by only 4 to 17 days of life expectancy, depending on the age of the patient. Quality adjusting and discounting change neither the preferred strategy nor the closeness of the outcome. Sensitivity analyses also underscore the narrowness of the margin. Our analysis reaches different conclusions from previously published analyses. More important than the actual strategy preferred is the minute difference in expected utilities between administering and withholding INH. We suggest that the individual patient decide whether or not these differences are meaningful.\r"

The patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either 200 or 800 micrograms budesonide per day for a period of 8 wk. The active treatment period was preceded by a selection period of 3 wk, and a single-blind placebo period of 2 wk. During these initial 5 wk the maintenance treatment of the patients, including cromolyn sodium and inhaled corticosteroids, was withheld. Spirometry and inhalation provocation tests with methacholine were carried out, and the symptom score was recorded every 2 wk. The methacholine provocation concentrations (geometric mean) causing a decrease in FEV1 of 20% (PC20) in the 200 and 800 micrograms/day treatment groups just before the active treatment period were 0.90 and 0.91 mg/ml, respectively. These values increased significantly to 1.21 and 1.84 mg/ml after 2 wk of treatment (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001, respectively) and to 1.55 and 2.74 mg/ml after 8 wk of treatment (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001). During the whole study period budesonide in a dosage of 800 micrograms/day induced a significantly larger change in PC20 than in a dosage of 200 micrograms/day. The FEV1 before treatment was 91 +/- 3% (SEM) and 84 +/- 2% of the predicted value in the 200 and 800 micrograms/day treatment groups, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was a significant increase in the percentage of mast cells in both groups of asthmatics although the counts were no different from those previously reported for a number of other respiratory diseases. Asthmatics with airway hyperreactivity (PC20 less than 4 mg/ml) had significant increases in spontaneous histamine release. There was a significant elevation in the eosinophil count and the concentration of major basic protein (MBP) in BAL fluid in the symptomatic asthmatics. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the amounts of MBP recovered and the percentage of eosinophils in the BAL. These changes were even more marked when asthmatics with airway hyperreactivity were compared with subjects with normoreactive airways. In addition, there was a significant increase in the percentage of epithelial cells in the hyperreactive asthmatics. There was an inverse correlation between the PC20 and the percentage of mast cells (p less than 0.01), eosinophils (p less than 0.05), and epithelial cells (p less than 0.05) and amount of MBP in BAL (p less than 0.01). This study supports the hypothesis that bronchial hyperresponsiveness is secondary to epithelial cell damage mediated through eosinophil-derived granule products.\r"

  ".U": "88104910\r", 
  ".W": "Bleomycin produces a dose- and time-dependent interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in humans, and is widely used to produce an animal model for the study of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism(s) for bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis is (are) unknown, but the production of oxygen radicals by a ferrous ion-molecular oxygen pathway might be related to the fibrosis. Therefore, we studied the effect of iron deficiency on the biochemical, inflammatory, and morphologic parameters of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in the hamster. Mild iron deficiency was induced in hamsters by bleeding via the retro-orbital sinus and maintenance on an iron-deplete diet. After intratracheal administration of bleomycin (1 U), there was no accumulation of lung collagen in the iron-deficient bleomycin-treated animals. In comparison, iron-replete animals treated with bleomycin exhibited a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in lung collagen. In addition, bleomycin-treated iron-replete animals had increased lung lipid peroxidation (p less than 0.05), whereas bleomycin-treated iron-deficient animals did not (p greater than 0.05). Lung DNA and morphometric estimates of the lesion severity were significantly increased in both iron-replete and iron-deficient bleomycin-treated animals. These data indicate that iron deficiency is associated with a reduction in the severity of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, possibly by the prevention of iron-catalyzed oxygen-radical formation and lipid peroxidation.\r"

Our results show a positive correlation (p = 0.03) between increases of EVLW, reflecting lung edema, and beta 2MG concentrations in urine of all patients with ARDS, indicating systemically increased permeability. Generalized increase of permeability can also explain the elevation of MG urine concentrations (p = 0.03) together with an EVLW increase, and an increase of BAL protein concentrations (IgG, TF, p less than 0.01) in the early post-trauma phase during the first 48 h after admission.

The majority of reported patients presenting are middle-aged, with the exact pathogenesis not clearly understood. The reason for this late clinical presentation of a congenital abnormality is also not clear. However, reports of children with recurrent pancreatitis and an associated pancreas divisum have now appeared. None had any identifiable cause of pancreatitis. Pancreas divisum was diagnosed or suspected preoperatively in two, with findings on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and gastroduodenoscopy. All findings were confirmed at operation. All underwent surgical treatment with good results within 6 months. Review of the literature showed eight patients younger than 18 years with pancreas divisum and pancreatitis requiring operation. All had good results after surgical repair. It appears that this anomaly can be associated with recurrent pancreatitis in children. Children with recurrent pancreatitis with no obvious cause should be evaluated for pancreas divisum and, if it is found, be surgically treated. The role of ERCP, while not clearly defined, may become critical in the evaluation of pancreas divisum in children.\r"

Its frequency of use and the subsequent mortality rates, vary among surgeons and institutions. This review analyzes 50 cholecystostomies performed over 6 years at one institution, and defines outcome as related to presenting symptoms. Twenty five patients (Group 1) presented with symptoms of acute cholecystitis, and underwent cholecystostomy. Twenty (80%) had gallstones and five (20%) were acalculous. Two patients died, a mortality rate of 8 per cent. Twenty five other patients (Group 2) developed signs suggesting cholecystitis during hospitalization for an unrelated illness. Only 50 per cent (13/25) of Group 2 patients were found to have cholecystitis at operation (eight calculous, five acalculous). Mortality was 62 per cent (8/13) in the Group 2 patients with inflammatory cholecystitis, and 50 per cent (6/12) for the patients with normal gallbladders. A positive outcome may be anticipated if cholecystostomy is used in patients admitted with acute cholecystitis who present too great a surgical risk for formal cholecystectomy. In contrast, the diagnosis of cholecystitis in the critically ill patient can be difficult and the prognosis for survival is not good, even after cholecystostomy.\r"

  ".W": "Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the standard therapy for the management of hydrocephalus. Before the advent of silastic, early abdominal complications were frequent and finally led to the abandonment of this technique for management of hydrocephalus. With the use of silastic shunt tubing, VP shunts have once again gained favor as the procedure of choice. Although there are now considerably fewer complications from VP shunts, the presence of an intraperitoneal catheter can still initiate various complications. Abdominal complications of VP shunts are reported to be from 10-30 per cent, thus remaining clinically important for early recognition and treatment in patient management. An awareness of these complications is necessary in creating an index of suspicion for the primary physician whose patients harbor a VP shunt and present with abdominal symptoms. This report presents five cases of children with abdominal complications of VP shunts (four pseudocysts and one umbilical granuloma with spontaneous drainage of CSF). Additional abdominal complications of VP shunts are discussed, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives in order to improve and expedite accuracy in diagnosis and provide simplicity and efficiency in treatment.\r"

To meet this need, we offer a framework for expanding the model. Therapeutic contact takes place within a connexional, or transpersonal, dimension of human experience, within which basic human needs for connection and meaning are met. Although seldom explicitly recognized, connexional experience is basic to medical care. Awareness of this dimension of experience leads clinicians to appreciate that establishing a therapeutic relationship is one of the principal goals of medical practice. It also reframes the doctor's task to make clinical uncertainty more tolerable and situations in which there is no appropriate biomedical response (such as care of the terminally ill) less frustrating and more fulfilling.\r"

Diminished pancreatic polypeptide and epinephrine responses to hypoglycemia can predict the development of overt autonomic neuropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; identification of patients with a predilection to develop autonomic neuropathy may permit earlier treatment.\r"

Campylobacter pylori has many attributes in common with other campylobacters but it may represent a new genus. It produces abundant quantities of urease, and this property has been used to develop a rapid diagnostic test. The organism is found predominantly beneath the gastric mucus layer that lines the surface epithelium of the stomach. Infection with C. pylori causes an acute histologic gastritis which may become chronic. The bacterium is the etiologic agent in type-B gastritis. Prevalence of the organism in asymptomatic persons appears to be age related. Campylobacter pylori is found commonly in patients with peptic ulcer disease, always in association with chronic gastritis. Eradication of the organism is associated with healing of the gastritis and a lower relapse rate in duodenal ulcer disease. A role for the organism in other upper gastrointestinal diseases is unproven.\r"

Strategies have been developed to limit the number of hypotheses that a program must consider and to incorporate pathophysiologic reasoning. The latter innovation permits a program to analyze cases in which one disorder influences the presentation of another. Prototypes embodying such reasoning can explain their conclusions in medical terms that can be reviewed by the user. Despite these advances, further major research and developmental efforts will be necessary before expert performance by the computer becomes a reality.\r"

The characteristic \"bull's eye\" lesions seen with hepatic ultrasound examination or computed tomography generally are not detectable until neutrophil recovery has occurred. Diagnosis can be established only by biopsy evidence of yeasts or pseudohyphae in the granulomatous lesions. Cultures are frequently negative, however, especially in patients who have been pretreated with antifungal agents.

A biopsy specimen of the scaly erythematous plaque demonstrated hyperkeratosis with follicular plugging, papillomatosis, and acanthosis. Direct immunofluorescence studies of lesional skin using monoclonal antibodies to epidermal prekeratin, filaggrin, and involucrin revealed normal staining patterns. The patient's cultured keratinocytes were morphologically unremarkable and contained profilaggrin, involucrin, and a normal complement of cytokeratins. The expression of the disease may not occur in cultured cells, because they lack many features of fully keratinized cells. A review of the literature concerning ichthyosis and deafness reveals that the constellation of cutaneous and extracutaneous abnormalities in this case does not exactly conform to that in previously reported cases. Precise classification of the patient's disorder will require demonstration of the basic defect(s).\r"

The bacteriologic spectrum of the prophylactic drug should include oral microflora, especially anaerobic bacteria.

A total of 92 complications requiring relaparotomy in 42 patients ended fatally in nine patients. The overall operative and hospital mortality rate was 3.1%. The most frequent and most dangerous were complications at or around the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis, which occurred 25 times with five deaths. Postoperative hemorrhage was seen in 16 patients; endoscopic treatment in four patients and operation in 12 patients was successful in stopping the bleeding in all but one patient. Eight biliary fistulae either ceased spontaneously (3 patients) or after operative reintervention (5 patients) without any mortality. Control of these complications depends on four lines of approach: (1) before operation: optimal preparation of the jaundiced patient including endoscopic transpapillary decompression of the common duct; (2) during operation: a meticulous and standardized technique is mandatory; (3) after operation: continuous observation in the surgical intensive care unit is essential for the timely detection of possible complications; and (4) early reintervention can salvage the great majority of these patients with deleterious complications.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate changes of peripheral ketone body (KB) metabolism after operation, muscle metabolism in postsurgical patients was studied at 3 hours (SI) and 24 hours (SII) after surgery by the forearm catheter technique. Data were compared to those of equivalent fasted controls (CI, CII). In a manner consistent with enhanced mobilization of endogenous substrate stores, arterial concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA), 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HOB), and acetoacetate (AcAc) were markedly elevated immediately after surgery. This increase was accompanied by a rise in muscular utilization of AcAc (SI: 0.21 +/- 0.05 mumol/100 g/min; CI: 0.08 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.05) and 3-HOB (SI: 0.24 +/- 0.06 mumol/100 g/min; CI: 0.11 +/- 0.01, p less than 0.05). Surprisingly, on the first postoperative day, concentrations of AcAc and 3-HOB fell below those of fasting controls. Concomitantly, the utilization rate of AcAc by muscle (SII: 0.07 +/- 0.03 mumol/100 g/min; CII: 0.27 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.05) was significantly lower in patients than in controls. Reduction of the fractional extraction rate of AcAc (SI: 38.4 +/- 3.8%; SII: 24.0 +/- 6.1%, p less than 0.05), as well as a net production of 3-HOB by muscle (SII: -0.08 +/- 0.05 mumol/100 g/min; CII: 0.49 +/- 0.13, p less than 0.05) 24 hours after surgery indicated a reduced peripheral capacity for KB removal. Since this finding was related to a significantly higher rate of muscular glycerol production (SII: -0.13 +/- 0.03 mumol/100 g/min; CII: -0.06 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.05), one may suggest that increased intramuscular availability of FFA from triglyceride hydrolysis was responsible for the impairment of peripheral KB utilization. These results indicate that KBs contribute little to energy metabolism in skeletal muscle tissue in the late postoperative phase.\r"

Controversies regarding the definition, etiology, local anatomy, and treatment are discussed. The ages of the patients ranged from 1 day to 25 years old, and the male to female ratio was 2:1. There were associated anomalies in 27% of the patients, and moderate to severe heart failure in 59% of them. Mortality was 100% in the medically managed group; the surgical mortality was 16%. Previous surgical techniques utilized were simple closure, patch closure of the aortic end, and obliteration of the tunnel on both ends. Progressive aortic incompetence seems to be a common, but not well-documented problem on long-term follow-up. We have classified the lesion into four types (I, II, III, and IV) that have a bearing on the appropriate surgical techniques of repair, and describe a new technique for the repair of type III ALVT in which septal aneurysm is present.\r"

Eleven patients showed no evidence of graft rejection. There were eight episodes of acute rejection demonstrated at endomyocardial biopsy in 7 patients. Three patients were treated with corticosteroids, 3 were treated with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (RATG), and 1 died before treatment (early mortality: 5.6%). Using the monoclonal antibody technique, 150 determinations of lymphocyte subpopulations were performed and were correlated with 72 endomyocardial biopsy specimens. Cyclosporine immunosuppression caused a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in total lymphocyte count (38%) and in the number of OKT3 (52%) and OKT4 cells (55%). During acute rejection, total lymphocytes and OKT3, OKT4, and OKT8 cells all increased significantly, but the T4 to T8 ratio did not change significantly. Treatment of rejection with corticosteroids resulted in a moderate but not significant decrease in all T-cell types, whereas RATG caused a marked but not selective decrease in all T-cell groups. In conclusion, T cells decrease with cyclosporine immunosuppression and with treatment of rejection and increase at onset of rejection, but the T4 to T8 ratio has no predictive value for the diagnosis and severity of rejection, and the sensitivity of the method does not permit its use to assess the degree of immunosuppression with cyclosporine following heart transplantation.\r"

In the first stage, early reconstruction with a forearm flap for the oral floor, the pharynx, and the cervical esophagus can be done safely 3 months after the original injury when the acute inflammation of the tissue has disappeared. The forearm flap is thin and pliable, and has a good blood supply for primary healing without failure or stricture. Dysphagia is eliminated because food passes down by gravity. There is no constriction or hyperperistalsis of the colon, both of which are occasionally seen with the traditional colon interposition. In the second stage, the traditional method is used to finish the reconstruction of the remainder of the esophagus.\r"

Five of these men were treated with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor, suramin, for a period of 19 to 37 weeks. In contrast with reported changes in HIV antigen levels after treatment with zidovudine, HIV antigenemia persisted in the suramin-treated group, as well as in the untreated group. No clinical or immunologic improvement was seen in either group within the observation period. These data add evidence to the notion that monitoring HIV antigen levels helps to assess the efficacy of antiviral therapy.\r"

  ".U": "88105778\r", 
  ".W": "During the last six years, there has been increased interest in the detection of abnormalities of left ventricular diastolic function in patients with heart disease. Before 1981, most studies on diastolic function were performed in the catheter laboratory using invasive techniques and complex methods. Recently, radionuclide angiograms and Doppler echocardiography have been employed to measure the dynamics of filling in normal individuals and in patients with heart disease. These methods are noninvasive, easy to perform, accurate, and reproducible. It is now clear that diastolic function may be altered globally and regionally, at rest and perhaps during exercise, in many patients with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, these diastolic abnormalities may even appear before systolic abnormalities are identified in these patients. Thus, diastolic abnormalities may permit assessment of presence of disease early in its evolution. Whether detection and quantitation of diastolic abnormalities will permit grading of disease severity or evaluation of therapeutic efficacy remains an important research question. At the present time, it appears that the decision to employ either radionuclide angiography or Doppler echocardiography for the assessment of diastolic abnormalities will depend on the local expertise to carry out the investigation. Both diagnostic modalities require standardization of accuracy and reproducibility with proper selection of control values from the appropriate populations of normal individuals. It is also important to remember that left ventricular diastolic abnormalities have to be identified after the elimination of the confounding influence of variables such as ejection fraction, heart rate, age, and preload (end-diastolic volume). Automation of the derivation of indexes of diastolic filling should provide an objective assessment of the dynamics of left ventricular filling. Although the value of measurement of diastolic filling in the individual patient remains controversial, we believe that the practice of cardiology is incomplete without consideration of the second half of cardiac function.\r"

In particular, assessment of immediate and later follow-up treatment of psychotic patients (1) indicates that moderate doses are adequate for most patients, (2) fails to support the utility of unusually high doses, and (3) even suggests the existence of a biphasic relationship of antipsychotic efficacy to dose of neuroleptics and possibly to plasma concentrations of the drugs as well. Trends toward lesser overall clinical benefits of high doses may reflect untoward extrapyramidal or other central nervous system effects leading to behavioral and cognitive symptoms. Thus, moderate doses of neuroleptics appear, on average, to be about as effective as, and probably safer than, the larger doses that have been popular in the United States in recent years.\r"

Each trial was designed to last six weeks. Tranylcypromine and carbamazepine trials had the highest completion rates. Physicians rated patients as significantly improved relative to placebo while receiving tranylcypromine and carbamazepine. Patients rated themselves as significantly improved relative to placebo only while receiving tranylcypromine. Patients who tolerated a full trial of trifluoperazine showed improvement, those receiving carbamazepine demonstrated a marked decrease in the severity of behavioral dyscontrol, and those receiving alprazolam had an increase in the severity of the episodes of serious dyscontrol. As an adjunct to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy can produce modest but clinically important improvement in the mood and behavior of patients with borderline personality disorder. As a research tool, patterns of pharmacological response may provide clues to biological mechanisms underlying dysphoria and behavioral dyscontrol.\r"

Phenelzine superiority appeared even greater after an additional six-week continuation phase. Imipramine was only moderately effective in this atypical depressive sample. Unexpectedly, the superiority of either phenelzine or imipramine to placebo was largely confined to patients in subsets of the study sample who were prospectively judged to also have a history of spontaneous panic attacks and/or show hysteroid dysphoric features. This is consonant with some but not other recent findings and requires replication. Overall, the concept of atypical depression as a subtype that is preferentially responsive to monoamine oxidase inhibitors is supported.\r"

To investigate whether clomipramine treatment in OCD affects brain serotonergic responsiveness, metachlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a selective serotonin agonist, and placebo were given under double-blind conditions to nine patients with OCD before and after treatment with clomipramine. Unlike our previous observations of a marked transient increase in obsessional symptoms and anxiety following 0.5 mg/kg of mCPP, readministration of mCPP after four months of treatment with clomipramine did not significantly increase obsessional symptoms and anxiety. Similarly, the hyperthermic effect of mCPP observed before treatment was eliminated after treatment with clomipramine. These findings are consistent with the development of adaptive subsensitivity to the serotonergic agonist mCPP during clomipramine treatment. A similar alteration in the response to endogenous serotonin may mediate clomipramine's antiobsessional effects.\r"

Thymocyte precursors in the injected donor-bone marrow cells could proliferate in the thymic microenvironment in the following manner: first, preferentially proliferating into the subcapsular cortex; and second, spreading to the whole layer of the cortex, a portion of them gradually moving into the medulla. The proliferation of donor-type thymocytes was most pronounced when intrathymic injection of bone marrow cells (ITB) was performed in newborn mice and especially prominent in week-old mice; it took approximately ten weeks for donor-type thymocytes to finish the whole course of proliferation, differentiation, and emigration to the periphery. When ITB was performed in mice 4 weeks of age and older, the proliferation of donor-type thymocytes was retarded at onset, less pronounced in magnitude, and disappeared earlier. Emigration of donor-type T cells from the thymus to the peripheral lymphoid tissues occurred most rapidly when ITB was performed in newborn mice, and these T cells continued to reside thereafter in the peripheral lymphoid tissues. However, when ITB was performed in mice 4 weeks of age and older, the number of emigrated T cells in the spleen decreased (about a tenth of that in newborn mice) and, moreover, these T cells resided only transiently in the spleen. It was suggested that T cells emigrating from the thymus of mice from newborn to 2 weeks of age are long-lived, whereas those from the thymus in mice 4 weeks of age and older are short-lived. However, when 4-week-old young adult mice were treated by irradiation or hydrocortisone, the thymic capacity was enhanced in terms of proliferation and peripheralization of thymocytes, and emigrated T cells became long-lived.\r"

Activated protein C and protein S act by inhibiting the action of the cofactors factor Va and factor VIIIa. Antithrombin III inhibits the serine proteases (factors II, IX, X, XI, and XII); its anticoagulant action is dramatically enhanced by heparin. Deficiencies of these proteins are associated with thromboembolic disease. Antigen and activity assays practical for the clinical laboratory are available for protein C and antithrombin III. Protein S antigen assays are also available. Diagnosis of an anticoagulant protein deficiency has serious implications for a patient and his kindred, and should therefore only be made on the basis of repeated abnormal determinations of a single protein in an individual patient, or documentation of the same protein deficiency in other family members.\r"

All umbilical veins demonstrated intense endothelial cell staining. None of the arteries stained. To corroborate the immunohistochemical findings, three fresh umbilical cords were dissected to separate arteries from veins and then were incubated in oxygenated tissue baths containing Ringer's lactate (37 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Cumulative 6KPGF production as measured by radioimmunoassay of tissue effluents was markedly different between arteries and veins with the umbilical vein producing the largest quantity of 6KPGF. Thus, immunohistochemistry and ex vivo capacitance studies suggest that there is a differential distribution of 6KPGF in human umbilical arteries and veins.\r"

Rearrangement analysis is not only useful in differential diagnosis and classification, but also serves as a sensitive unique clonal marker to detect early occult recurrence in patients after therapy. In a similar manner, chromosomal translocations associated with specific disease types can be detected with DNA probes in Southern blot analysis without the use of conventional cytogenetics. Using this approach, one may diagnose specific chromosomal translocations associated with histologic types of lymphoma and leukemia. When appropriately applied, DNA rearrangement analysis complements conventional histology, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetics.\r"

The neoplasms grossly resembled ordinary colonic adenomas and adenocarcinomas but microscopically were composed of uniform cells with optically clear cytoplasm. Mucin stains were negative, and the clear nature of the cytoplasm was due to glycogen accumulation. Areas of transition between normal colonic epithelial constituents and the clear-cell lesion were observed. Three of the four cases stained strongly positively for carcinoembryonic antigen. These lesions are apt to give rise to considerable diagnostic confusion and, in particular, resemble metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The usual strong positive carcinoembryonic antigen reaction is helpful in establishing this diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Stroke is a recurrent disease. Approximately one in four hospital admissions for stroke is due to recurrence; patients who have had a stroke are five times as likely to have another stroke as matched controls without stroke. While attention has been focused on the problem of primary prevention of stroke in patients with hypertension and/or transient ischemic attacks, the important problem of preventing stroke recurrence has been addressed to only a limited extent. In this paper, we review known risk factors for recurrence as well as possible medical and surgical approaches to reducing the probability of stroke recurrence. At this point, there appears to be no intervention which has unequivocal proven benefit, although several large-scale clinical trials are now in progress. Further clinical research on this problem is needed. An opportune time to institute and conduct research on interventions directed toward reducing the risk of stroke recurrence may be during the subacute recovery phase while patients are engaged in a program of comprehensive medical rehabilitation. Prevention of recurrent stroke and related vascular events for which stroke patients have increased risk (eg, myocardial infarction) should be of major concern in stroke rehabilitation practice.\r"

Therefore, we recommend nonoperative methods for the management of this acute disease. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage (PTCD) combined with antibiotic and fluid treatment was used successfully in the management of 41 patients with acute pyogenic cholangitis due to intrahepatic stones. The general condition of these patients improved after treatment with PTCD. Repeated cholangiography should be performed so that the entire biliary tree and lesions can be viewed. Elective surgery (21 patients) or removal of the stone through the sinus tract via PTCD (14 patients) was performed when the patients' general condition improved following emergency PTCD. Therefore, we recommend PTCD over emergency surgery in the treatment of acute septic intrahepatic stones.\r"

Histologically, cholesterol polyps accounted for most of the benign lesions, and all the malignant lesions were adenocarcinomas. Gallstones coexisted in 50% of the malignant lesions and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed anomalous pancreaticobiliary junctions in three of five patients with malignant lesions. Sixty-nine percent of patients with benign lesions were under 60 years of age, whereas 75% of those with malignant lesions were over 60. Ninety-four percent of the benign lesions were under 1.0 cm in diameter, while 88% of the malignant lesions exceeded this size. Spread and size of the tumor showed a close correlation. Therefore, size of the tumor is a vital indicator in the treatment of polypoid lesions of the gallbladder, and a malignancy should be considered when the tumor exceeds 1.0 cm in diameter.\r"

No difference was seen between the two groups according to the experience of the surgeon, type of operation, diagnosis, weight of thyroid specimens, operation time, and hospital stay. All complications were recorded and resulted in two patients receiving reoperation because of bleeding, two permanent laryngeal nerve palsies, one case of permanent hypocalcemia, ten minor hematomas, one wound infection, and one lymphatic leakage. No difference was seen between the groups. This study does not support prophylactic routine drainage after uncomplicated thyroid surgery.\r"

Crohn's disease of the appendix should be considered in patients who are in their second and third decades of life, who have pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, and whose symptoms are protracted (longer than three days) and/or recurrent. Intraoperatively, if the appendiceal wall appears hypertrophic, thickened, and chronically inflamed, a frozen section may confirm the diagnosis. Crohn's disease of the appendix is a diagnosis of exclusion. Appendectomy may be performed safely and has a low morbidity and mortality. The incidence of enterocutaneous fistula and the recurrence rate are much lower than for Crohn's disease of the small and large bowel.\r"

When each group served as their own controls, the cyclophosphamide group had a significant decrease in episodes while the placebo group did not. When the placebo group was then given cyclophosphamide, they also had a significant decrease in episodes. When all patients who were receiving cyclophosphamide were combined for analysis, the decrease in episodes was even more evident. Complications were minimal. These results suggest that monthly intravenous doses of cyclophosphamide may influence the frequency and duration of episodes of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis.\r"

The controlled-release agents had a slower rise to peak plasma values and flatter pharmacokinetic curves than did the standard. The area under the curve for CR-3 was significantly increased by 55.5% as compared with standard agent and by 84.2% as compared with CR-2. No differences in clinical efficacy were found between controlled-release agents and the standard agent for this group of parkinsonian patients with mild to moderate severity. The dissociation between the prolonged serum levodopa levels and unimproved clinical efficacy may have resulted from the absence of patients with prominent motor fluctuations and/or substantial serum levodopa variability that was especially prominent with CR-3.\r"

Although Balint's syndrome, the name now given to these disorders of attention and visuomotor control, is well established in the neurologic literature, there remain problems of interpretation.

For each disorder, these specialists specified the percentage of all patients who should see a physician, as well as the percentage who should see a consultant neurologist, the appropriate duration of the initial patient encounter, and the appropriate frequency of follow-up visits per annum. When compared with American estimates used in health manpower planning, British neurologists generally make a far greater allowance for patient self-care, as well as care by nonphysician health care providers, allow less time for patient encounters, and see a need for follow-up care less frequently. These marked differences in the perceptions of specialists of a normative character may determine, in part, the different \"practice styles\" of physicians in different regions that cannot be explained in economic terms. Results suggest that the practice style concept should be broadened to include the use of health personnel of many types, the scope of specialty medicine, and the role definition of primary care.\r"

Antigen-presenting cells are involved in the uptake and processing of antigen for presentation to T lymphocytes, thereby playing a central role in induction of the immune response. The recognition of antigen by T lymphocytes requires that an APC express major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Using immunoperoxidase staining techniques, the presence of cells expressing class II glycoproteins and T-cell subsets were determined. The staining patterns of the trabecular meshwork, ciliary body, cornea/sclera, and conjunctive are described for monoclonal antibodies OKT6, OKM1, HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ, and T-cell markers OKT8, Leu-3a, and Leu-4. The results of the present study demonstrate that the anterior chamber contains a network of immunocompetent cells. The presence of a subpopulation of cells within the anterior chamber that express class II glycoproteins of the major histocompatibility complex suggests this tissue may play an important role in immune regulation within the eye.\r"

  ".U": "88108135\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred seventy-nine patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in first remission (n = 75), chronic myelocytic leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase (n = 48) or leukemia in advanced stage (n = 56) were given HLA-identical marrow grafts and randomized to receive methotrexate or cyclosporine for prevention of graft-v-host disease (GVHD). The current report updates the three prospective trials with follow-ups ranging from 3.2 to 6.2 years after marrow grafting. Results were analyzed separately for each individual study and for all three studies combined. Overall, 40% of patients given cyclosporine and 55% of those given methotrexate developed acute GVHD (P = .13); the incidence of chronic GVHD was 42% and 48%, respectively (P = .67). Twenty-two percent of cyclosporine-treated patients and 30% of methotrexate-treated patients developed interstitial pneumonia of any etiology (P = .25), and the figures for cytomegalovirus pneumonia were 18% and 20%, respectively (P = .41). The overall incidence of leukemic relapse was 31% in cyclosporine-treated patients and 36% in methotrexate-treated patients (P = .75). The probabilities of survival for cyclosporine-v methotrexate-treated patients were comparable for all three study groups: 52% v 48% in patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (P = .42), 55% v 60% for those with chronic myelocytic leukemia (P = .61), 12% and 12% for those with advanced leukemia (P = .93), and 39% v 38% overall (P = .72). We conclude that cyclosporine and methotrexate are comparable regarding the likelihood of acute/chronic GVHD, interstitial pneumonia, leukemic relapse, and long-term survival.\r"

  ".W": "T cell depletion of donor bone marrow can prevent graft v host disease (GVHD) in human and murine marrow graft recipients. However, engraftment in the recipient may be compromised as a consequence of donor marrow T cell depletion. The effect of recombinant murine granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rmu GM-CSF) on engraftment and hematologic reconstitution was evaluated in a murine allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model involving T cell depletion of marrow. Before transplantation into irradiated mice differing at major and minor histocompatibility loci, rmu GM-CSF was preincubated with T cell-depleted donor marrow. When low degrees of engraftment were noted in control recipients, treatment of donor marrow with high concentrations of rmu GM-CSF led to enhanced engraftment. Ex vivo donor graft incubation with rmu GM-CSF or a single in vivo injection of rmu GM-CSF were both effective means of promoting engraftment. When the engraftment rate in control recipients was high, rmu GM-CSF did not have an identifiable effect. Only slight increases in hematologic recovery were detected regardless of the rate of engraftment. Neither post-BMT survival nor marrow stem cell capacity was affected by rmu GM-CSF incubation. Furthermore, growth factor administration did not have a significant effect on the incidence of GVHD in recipients of non-T cell-depleted bone marrow splenocyte preparations. In vitro natural killer-mediated target cell lysis was not altered by incubation of effector cells with rmu GM-CSF. These results demonstrate the potential of ex vivo rmu GM-CSF treatment of donor marrow to facilitate engraftment across extensive histo-compatibility barriers.\r"

  ".W": "The chromosome 22 derivative, the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, results from a reciprocal translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11) and is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The translocation can be identified at the DNA level in Ph-positive CML by using a probe to the breakpoint cluster region (bcr). In addition, as a result of this translocation an abl-related 210-kd protein with protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity is produced. We analyzed 28 cases of Ph-negative CML for rearrangement of the chromosome 22 sequences and found that eight of the 28 show rearrangement of the bcr. When 12 of the Ph-negative cases were independently reviewed, five were indistinguishable from Ph-positive CML on the basis of morphology, peripheral blood film and clinical details. These five also showed bcr rearrangement. The other seven were reclassified as six atypical CML (aCML) and one chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). None of these seven showed bcr rearrangement. In addition 11 cases of bcr- CML were assayed for abl-related PTK, and no detectable activity was present, whereas p210 phl/abl PTK was observed both in Ph-positive (three cases examined) and Ph-negative, bcr + (four cases examined) CML. Therefore, bcr + CML, whether or not the Ph chromosome is cytogenetically apparent, involves a similar molecular alteration and produces the 210-kd protein with enhanced PTK activity. Furthermore, these cases can be distinguished from Ph-negative bcr- CML by careful evaluation of clinical and hematologic data.\r"

  ".U": "88108147\r", 
  ".W": "The normal myeloid hematopoietic regulatory proteins include one class of proteins that induces viability and multiplication of normal myeloid precursor cells to form colonies (colony-stimulating factors [CSF] and interleukin 3 [IL-3], macrophage and granulocyte inducing proteins, type 7 [MGI-1]) and another class (called MGI-2) that induces differentiation of normal myeloid precursors without inducing cell multiplication. Different clones of myeloid leukemic cells can differ in their response to these regulatory proteins. One type of leukemic clone can be differentiated in vitro to mature cells by incubating with the growth-inducing proteins granulocyte-macrophage (GM) CSF or IL-3, and another type of clone can be differentiated in vitro to mature cells by the differentiation-inducing protein MGI-2. We have now studied the ability of different myeloid regulatory proteins to induce the in vivo differentiation of these different types of mouse myeloid leukemic clones in normal and cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The results show that in both types of mice (a) the in vitro GM-CSF- and IL-3-sensitive leukemic cells were induced to differentiate to mature cells in vivo in mice injected with pure recombinant GM-CSF and IL-3 but not with G-CSF, M-CSF, or MGI-2; (b) the in vitro MGI-2-sensitive leukemic cells differentiated in vivo by injection of MGI-2 and also, presumably indirectly, by GM-CSF and IL-3 but not by M-CSF or G-CSF; (c) in vivo induced differentiation of the leukemic cells was associated with a 20- to 60-fold decrease in the number of blast cells; and (d) all the injected myeloid regulatory proteins stimulated the normal myelopoietic system. Different normal myeloid regulatory proteins can thus induce in vivo terminal differentiation of leukemic cells, and it is suggested that these proteins can have a therapeutic potential for myeloid leukemia in addition to their therapeutic potential in stimulating normal hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".U": "88108154\r", 
  ".W": "Pure interleukin 1 (IL 1) was found to stimulate established human bone marrow stromal layers in long-term culture to produce colony-stimulating activity (CSA). Maximal concentrations in the culture medium were reached 24 hours after a single IL 1 pulse. The effect could be neutralized by a specific rabbit anti-IL 1 antiserum. Stromal layers, once stimulated by IL 1, continued to release CSA into the culture medium in the absence of exogenous IL 1. A second IL 1 pulse induced CSA release in an identical manner, as did the primary stimulation, indicating that the CSA released was actively produced. Using specific immunologic assays, both granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and macrophage CSF (M-CSF) could be identified in the culture supernatants, and production of both factors was inducible by IL 1. Shortly after initiation of the long-term marrow cultures \"spontaneous\" G-CSF and M-CSF release occurred. The release of G-CSF diminished following addition of the anti-IL 1 antiserum, indicating that endogenous production of IL 1 by stromal cells had contributed to this effect. These results further support the role of IL 1 as an important modulator of CSF production by cells of the hematopoietic microenvironment.\r"

  ".U": "88108164\r", 
  ".W": "Expression of both the c-fos and c-sis protooncogenes during myeloid differentiation has been detected in cells of the monocytic lineage. Since an increase in c-fos transcripts was not detected during dimethylsulfoxide induced HL-60 granulocytic differentiation, it was suggested that within the myeloid series c-fos gene expression might be lineage specific. In the present study, we have determined whether expression of the c-fos and c-sis genes is indeed specific for the monocytic pathway or rather common to both the granulocyte and monocyte pathways. C-fos and c-sis gene expression was analyzed in freshly isolated human granulocytes and monocytes, in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells induced to differentiate along the granulocytic or monocytic pathway, in myeloblasts from five patients with the M1 or M2 subtype of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and in blasts from six patients with M4 myelomonocytic leukemia. The level of c-fos mRNA was fifteen times higher in granulocytes as compared with monocytes. An increase in c-fos expression was also found in HL-60 cells differentiated along the granulocytic pathway after exposure to hypoxanthine, hexamethylene bisacetamide, and the combination of retinoic acid and dibutyryl adenosine 3'5' cyclic monophosphate. Three of 5 M1 and M2 leukemic myeloblast preparations depleted of lymphoid and monocytic cells and all six M4 leukemic cells expressed c-fos transcripts. In contrast, c-sis gene transcripts were detectable in monocytes and during drug induced monocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cells but not in granulocytes during granulocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cells or in AML samples. Thus, in the myeloid series, c-sis gene expression is lineage specific while expression of the c-fos gene is found in both lineages and may be related to metabolic pathways common to both granulocytes and monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a family whose members have impaired platelet aggregation and secretion responses to epinephrine with normal responses to adenosine diphosphate and collagen. Platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors (measured using 3H methyl-yohimbine) were diminished in the propositus (78 sites per platelet), his two sisters (70 and 27 sites per platelet), and parents (37 and 63 sites per platelet), but not in two maternal aunts (12 normal subjects, 214 +/- 18 sites per platelet; mean +/- SE). However, the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by epinephrine in platelets exposed to 400 nmol/L PGI2 was similar in the patients and five normal subjects (epinephrine concentration for 50% inhibition, 0.04 +/- 0.01 mumol/L v 0.03 +/- 0.01 mumol/L; P greater than .05). In normal platelets, the concentration of yohimbine (0.18 mumol/L) required for half maximal inhibition of aggregation induced by 2 mumol/L epinephrine was lower than that for inhibition of its effect on adenylate cyclase (1.6 mumol/L). In quin2 loaded platelets, thrombin (0.1 U/mL) stimulated rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, was normal in the two patients studied. The PGI2 analog ZK 36,374 completely inhibited thrombin-induced rise in [Ca2+]i; the reversal of this inhibition by epinephrine was normal in the two patients. Thus, despite the impaired aggregation response to epinephrine, platelets from these patients have normal ability to inhibit PGI2-stimulated cAMP levels. These patients with an inherited receptor defect provide evidence that fewer platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are required for epinephrine-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase than for aggregation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of splenectomy on renal allograft survival is not clear. In the rat, spleens isolated from recipients with functioning grafts have been shown to be a major source of cells that are capable of suppressing the rejection response (suppressor T lymphocytes). Thus the removal of the spleen in these allograft recipients could be detrimental to renal allograft survival. This study investigates this hypothesis, and looks for the presence of suppressor cells in other lymphoid organs apart from the spleen. In the rat renal allograft model, donor Lewis spleen cells given to DA recipients intravenously 1 week before transplantation of a Lewis kidney leads to indefinite allograft survival (median survival time (MST) greater than 100 days). Splenectomy before or after pretreatment with donor spleen cells failed to abrogate this effect (MST greater than 100 days). Experiments were performed in which cells or serum were prepared from long-term surviving splenectomized animals which had already been pretreated and transplanted, and then were injected into untreated recipients (adoptive transfer experiments). This was done to determine if cells capable of suppressing graft rejection were present in lymphoid organs outside the spleen in these splenectomized recipients. Thus the IV transfer of 10(8) lymph node cells harvested from splenectomized DA recipients with a long-term surviving LEW graft (LTS), into untreated but lightly irradiated (200 rad) DA recipients resulted in indefinite survival of a fresh Lewis kidney (MST greater than 100 days). In contrast, adoptive transfer of normal DA lymph node cells was ineffective (MST 13 days). Thus splenectomy is not necessarily detrimental to graft survival, as cells capable of preventing graft rejection are found in other lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes, in splenectomized recipients.\r"

Actuarial patient survival at 12 and 24 months was 97.7 per cent. Actuarial graft survival at 12 and 24 months was 79.5 per cent (first graft recipients 81.3 per cent and regrafted recipients 75 per cent). HLA-DR matching significantly improved graft survival which was 93 per cent at 1 year in patients given HLA-DR compatible kidneys, compared with 83 and 54 per cent, respectively, in patients who received kidneys mismatched for one or two HLA-DR antigens. There were 0.8 (s.d. = 0.7) episodes of acute rejection per patient during the first 3 months after transplantation. Triple therapy provides effective immunosuppression without evidence of over immunosuppression and reduces the incidence of cyclosporin side-effects. Although acute nephrotoxicity was uncommon, serum creatinine remained elevated 6 and 12 months after transplantation.\r"

To assess its clinical efficacy in the treatment of recurrent orolabial herpes a multicentre collaborative, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. The study patients were randomly assigned to receive either 3% foscarnet cream (78 patients) or placebo (cream vehicle) (75 patients) and were asked to start treatment at the earliest indication of a recurrence. Efficacy was evaluated in 143 patients (74 in the foscarnet group and 69 in the placebo group). There was no significant difference in time to healing or duration of virus shedding between the two groups. However, in the subgroup of patients who started treatment before vesicles appeared, the duration of virus shedding was shorter in the foscarnet group than in the placebo group (p = 0.04), and the proportion of lesions that evolved to the vesicular stage was smaller (p = 0.03). No significant difference in the incidence of local or systemic adverse effects was noted between the two groups. We conclude that the beneficial effect of foscarnet was limited to a subgroup of patients who started treatment in the prevesicular stage.\r"

Here we report a new case that was investigated using an electron microscope and a panel of monoclonal (MCA) and polyclonal (PCA) antibodies. CSHH cells were found to bear the immunohistochemical phenotype of normal epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) and histiocytosis X (HX) cells (CD1a/c+, CD1b-, CD4+/-, human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DR/DQ+, S-100+). However, an electron microscope showed a paucity of Birbeck granule (BG)-containing cells. This contrasted with their immunophenotype. This finding, along with other ultrastructural characteristics of CSHH cells, suggests that histologic differences exist between CSHH and HX. However, because no absolute histologic criterion is known that allows unequivocally the differential diagnosis between the two diseases, this distinction currently has to rely on clinical criteria, mainly the regressive course observed within a few months in CSHH. The precise nosologic position of CSHH among other histiocytic syndromes remains unsettled.\r"

Complete remission of ALL was induced in all patients, and symptoms of vertebral compression fractures abated following antileukemia therapy.

Thirty-nine other patients were found without such verification. Reportedly, most types of sarcomas are able to metastasize to the brain, and are represented in these 94 patients. Fibrosarcoma and alveolar soft-part sarcoma tumors metastasize to the brain without regard to treatment technique. There may be a group of tumors, including malignant fibrous histiocytoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and perhaps leiomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma, in which the incidence of brain metastases has increased with improved sarcoma chemotherapy (CT). In this group particularly, but also in alveolar soft-part sarcoma and others, the presence of lung metastases may increase the probability of brain metastasis occurring subsequently.\r"

In a control group (A, n = 54) the tumors were widely excised, and the regional lymph nodes were dissected. The patients in the perfusion group (B, n = 53) received additional hyperthermic (42 degrees C) perfusion with melphalan. The disease-free survival time was chosen as the criterion for success. An intermediate evaluation (average follow-up observation period of 550 days) revealed a highly significant difference between the groups (P = 0.0001): 21 recurrences in the control group versus four recurrences in the perfusion group. In a second analysis 3 1/2 years after premature discontinuation, 26 recurrences were diagnosed in Group A, whereas only six recurrences were noted in Group B (P = 0.0001). A retrospective analysis of the entire test group revealed the following figures. In Group A seven recurrences in Stage I were diagnosed, seven in Stage II, and 12 in Stage III. In Group B one was observed in Stage I, one in Stage II, and four in Stage III. The level of significance was calculated to be P = 0.05 in Stage I, P = 0.05 in Stage II, and P = 0.01 in Stage III. The results of the study show that additional perfusion in the treatment of extremity melanomas is superior to conventional methods.\r"

Staining with antivimentin and the melanoma-associated antigen, moAb NKI/C-3, was found to occur in all cases. The NKI/C-3 stained nine of 10 specimens from the first biopsy. Anti-S-100 protein, anti-HMW-MAA, and NKI-beteb was used as a panel in the second step. These stained ten of ten, five of six, and seven of seven cases, respectively. The diagnosis for melanin was confirmed by extensive sampling and a diligent search for melanin and (pre)melanosomes in different biopsy and surgical specimens. These results indicate that a step-wise application of immunohistochemistry is a very useful tool in the diagnosis of mucosal melanoma of the head and neck.\r"

In salivary gland tumors, P-450C21 was observed in most epithelial cells of duct origin within pleomorphic adenomas including cells of amorphous groups scattered in myxoid areas, and in adenolymphoma. Some mucous cells in mucoepidermoid tumor also were positive for this enzyme.

When the serum AFP concentration was below 1000 ng/ml, it could not be used as a measure to distinguish between HCC and benign liver diseases. However, the fucosylation index of AFP proved useful for such a purpose. The sensitivity of the analysis using the fucosylation index in total patients with HCC was 69%; the specificity was 96% in benign liver diseases, and the accuracy of this test was 77%. When HCC patients who were grouped according to tumor size (5 cm, 3 cm, and 2 cm in diameter) were analyzed, they all had a fucosylation index significantly higher than that in benign liver disease patients. The mean fucosylation index in 28 patients with a serum AFP concentration below 1000 ng/ml and a tumor diameter less than 3 cm was 26 +/- 30%. Corresponding values for 16 patients with an AFP concentration below 400 ng/ml and a tumor size less than 3 cm and for 8 patients with a concentration below 400 ng/ml and a tumor size less than 2 cm were 32 +/- 31% and 27 +/- 27%, respectively. These values were higher, with statistical significance, than those in patients with benign liver diseases. These data indicate that the measurement of the fucosylation index of AFP is useful for the early diagnosis of HCC.\r"

It is exclusively seen in infants 6 months of age or younger with malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (MRTK) or congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN). Secretion of parathormone or prostaglandin E2 by the tumor cells is responsible for the hypercalcemia in most of these patients. Bone metastasis has been notably absent in these patients, and the hypercalcemia completely resolves with the removal of the tumor. Hypercalcemia in itself probably does not have any prognostic significance; however, it may serve as a tumor marker in some patients. Early recognition and effective management of this complication may prevent the acute life-threatening as well as the longstanding complications of this serious metabolic disorder.\r"

The most intense reactivity for S-100 protein was found in well-differentiated chondrocytes of enchondromas, osteochondromas and chondrosarcomas, and in normal epiphyseal cartilage. S-100 protein was positive in both polygonal stromal cells and chondrocytes of chondroblastomas and in chondrocytes of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. In osteosarcomas not only chondroblastic areas but also osteoblastic areas showed positive cells. Reticulum histiocytic cells of eosinophilic granulomas and chordoma cells were positive for S-100 protein. The study yielded three main conclusions: (1) S-100 protein could be the marker for tumors of cartilaginous origin and differentiation, notochord origin, and T-zone histiocyte origin; (2) chondroblastoma can be distinguished from other histologically confusing giant cell lesions by using ABC to detect S-100 protein; and (3) S-100 protein has some relationship with tumoral calcification not only in cartilaginous tumors but also in osteosarcoma.\r"

There was a good correlation between KPS and FLIC scores at study entry, thus confirming results originally reported using the FLIC. However, a number of unexpected problems were encountered in data collection and quality control with this QOL assessment instrument. This made it impossible to look for differences in treatment effect on QOL in this clinical trial. It is believed that QOL assessment should be an integral part of cancer clinical trials; however, investigators must acknowledge the difficulties in collecting this type of data. The development of new instruments and the refinement of old ones will facilitate the collection of data for this important aspect of clinical trials research.\r"

In the radiotherapy arms the lung metastases were more frequently suitable for surgical treatment. The survival of patients with either tibia localizations or higher age was somewhat better. Local recurrences occurred in 16% of patients, 50% of them with distant metastases. The trial was executed from 1978 to 1983; 205 patients were evaluable and eligible, and three toxic deaths occurred in the chemotherapy arms.

When this is accounted for, the partial correlation of breast cancer rates with caffeine intake is negative (and significant at P less than 0.05). When the data are weighted by populations in each country, the negative partial correlation of caffeine with breast cancer disappears, but the strong positive association with fat intake remains unchanged. Although there have been suggestions that caffeine exacerbates fibrocystic disease of the breast and may be a causal factor in breast cancer, data from this study do not support a positive association between caffeine intake and subsequent development of breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The p21 protein product of the cellular oncogene ras, designated ras p21, has been detected immunohistochemically in normal, benign and malignant human thyroid tissues. With the monoclonal antibody RAP-5 generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid positions 10 to 17 of the ras p21 protein and an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC), the expression of the ras p21 was evaluated in paraffin-embedded sections. Western blot analysis using fresh thyroid carcinoma tissue revealed double protein bands, one band was at molecular weight 21,000 and the other was a more rapidly migrating band at the molecular weight 17,500. Immunohistochemically, papillary adenocarcinomas of the thyroid showed moderate to intense stainings for ras p21 in most cases. Cytoplasmic and apical surface stainings were the most common patterns of immunoreactivity. Adenomas showed variable ras p21 positivity in cytoplasm and apical surface stainings of adenomas were negative to borderline in most cases. The cytoplasm of tissues of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, and normal thyroid tissues was uniformly ras p21 positive, but the apical cell surface was nonreactive for ras p21 in all tissues. Judging from the findings obtained on this large series of normal, benign, and malignant thyroid tissues, the elevation of ras p21 may be a common event in thyroid neoplasm, and especially elevated ras expression in the apical cell surface may be characteristic to papillary carcinomas of the thyroid. This suggests that apical surface expression of ras p21 may be important in the development of thyroid carcinomas and be useful in differentiation of papillary adenocarcinoma.\r"

Concentrations of S100-alpha in the cortex were 80.3 +/- 22.5 ng/mg protein (n = 7), whereas those of renal cell carcinoma were 387 +/- 533 ng/mg protein (n = 19), i.e., about five times higher. Concentrations of S100-beta in both normal kidney (1.96 +/- 0.74 ng/mg protein) and renal cell carcinoma (2.05 +/- 2.16 ng/mg protein) were much lower than those of S100-alpha. The authors also localized S100-alpha and S100-beta in tissues of other renal tumors and tumors arising from other organs. S100a0 appears to be a useful immunohistochemical marker for renal cell carcinoma.\r"

They were clearly demonstrated on US and computed tomography (CT). Angiography disclosed tumor vessels in some area of the lesion, these features strongly suggested cystadenocarcinoma. The second case had a solid mass (7 X 7 cm) in the left hepatic lobe, in which many septal structures within the lesion were seen on enhanced CT and light dot like stains were recognized on angiography. The former findings coincided with the internal gross feature of the resected specimen. Both patients are doing well 8 months and 1 year and 6 months after operation, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative DNA measurements and estimates of blood group-related carbohydrate antigen expression have been used as predictive parameters in transitional cell carcinomas (Ca). To obtain an accurate quantitative characterization of cellular subpopulations on the basis of these parameters, the authors developed a dual-parameter flow cytometric method using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. With this method single-cell suspensions from 26 transitional cell carcinomas were analyzed by means of propidium iodide (red fluorescence) as DNA ligand, and peanut agglutinin (PNA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and anti-blood group A antibody (aBGA) as carbohydrate ligands. The latter ligands were visualized directly or indirectly by FITC (green fluorescence). The carbohydrate ligand binding was correlated to the DNA content of cell populations in the way that aneuploid populations showed a higher PNA binding (P less than 0.0002) and a lower WGA (P less than 0.01) and aBGA (P less than 0.04) binding than did diploid cell populations. The binding of PNA to aneuploid populations could be further increased (P less than 0.004) by neuraminidase treatments. Thus, aneuploid cells express both neuraminic acid substituted and unsubstituted PNA receptors. The carbohydrate ligand binding was cell cycle-dependent, as it was reduced (less than 0.008) in the G2-M phase. A low WGA (P less than 0.004) or aBGA (P less than 0.02) binding was correlated to tissue invasion. Immunohistochemistry with the carbohydrate ligands showed a good correlation between aBGA (P less than 0.0005) and PNA (P less than 0.004) binding to tumor cells and flow cytometric assay of these, as well as a correlation (P less than 0.003) between cellular location of WGA receptors and flow cytometric assay of these. It seems that dual-parameter flow cytometry represents an important tool in the characterization of bladder tumors.\r"

Three hundred seventy four thyroid carcinoma patients with completed thyroid ablation were investigated by means of conventional diagnostic procedures (131 iodine total-body scan, x-ray, TG determination) and, in addition, with high-resolution sonographic study of the neck. Sensitivity of TG for the detection of metastases amounted to 83% under TSH stimulation and 50% under thyroxine (T4) treatment. Specificity proved to be 95% under TSH stimulation and 99% under T4 treatment. Common features of the tumors associated with false-negative TG determinations (n = 16) were papillary histologic characteristics, manifestation in lymph nodes of the neck or mediastinum, and small size. It is therefore necessary for the early detection of persistent or recurrent papillary cancer metastases to perform in addition to 131 iodine scans high-resolution sonography of the neck in combination with the determination of TG serum concentrations under endogenous TSH stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the prostacyclin-mimetic, iloprost, on the reversibly damaged (\"stunned\") myocardium was studied in barbital-anesthetized, open-chest dogs subjected to 15 minutes of coronary artery occlusion and 3 hours of reperfusion. Regional myocardial segment shortening (%SS) was measured in the subendocardium of nonischemic and ischemic-reperfused areas by sonomicrometry. Iloprost was infused for 30 minutes beginning 15 minutes prior to occlusion (0.05 microgram/kg/min, ILO-LOW, or 0.1 microgram/kg/min, ILO-HIGH) or immediately prior to reperfusion (0.1 microgram/kg/min, ILO-REP). %SS in the ischemic-reperfused region recovered to 3% of pretreatment values in the control (saline-treated) group by 3 hours of reperfusion. In contrast, %SS in the iloprost-treated groups was significantly enhanced versus the control group at all times of reperfusion. At 3 hours of reperfusion, %SS recovered to 43% (ILO-LOW), 58% (ILO-HIGH), and 35% (ILO-REP) of pretreatment values. The beneficial effect on functional recovery was significantly greater when iloprost was administered before occlusion versus immediately prior to reperfusion. Thus, part of the salutory effects of iloprost appear to occur prior to and/or during ischemia. Iloprost did not improve collateral blood flow to the ischemic region or myocardial high energy phosphate content at 3 hours of reperfusion. While iloprost significantly decreased mean arterial pressure during ischemia and early reperfusion, the hypotensive action did not appear to play a role in the amelioration of postischemic dysfunction, as preocclusion treatment with an equihypotensive dose of sodium nitroprusside produced no significant effect on postischemic recovery beyond 5 minutes of reperfusion. Results of in vitro experiments indicated that iloprost had no effect on the xanthine oxidase free-radical generating system including lipid peroxidation. However, iloprost decreased the neutrophil-derived superoxide burst after chemotactic stimulation. This beneficial action may, in part, explain the efficacy of iloprost in enhancing postischemic function of the stunned myocardium.\r"

These patients also had the most extensive tumor disease. The occurrence of echocardiographic abnormalities of the left heart was similar to that in healthy individuals of the same age, but abnormalities were less frequent among the patients with severe right heart disease. Electrocardiographic changes were nonspecific. Right heart disease thus seems to be present more often than previously reported in patients with malignant midgut carcinoid tumors. The severity of cardiac involvement does not seem to be related to the duration of carcinoid disease but more to the extent of the disease, i.e., higher plasma levels of serotonin and tachykinins.\r"

The mean time to treatment was 3.5 hr. At 14 days there were 12 deaths in the treatment group (6.3%) and 17 deaths in the control group (9.6%) (p = .23). Early mortality was related to infarct location. Fourteen day mortality for anterior infarctions was 10.4% for treatment with IVSK and 22.4% for control patients (p = .06) and was similar for IVSK-treated patients with inferior infarctions, 4.0% vs 1.8% (p = .32). For those randomized under 3 hr, 14 day mortality tends to be lower in treated patients, 5.2% vs 11.5% (p = .11). There was significant improvement in long-term survival for patients with anterior infarction; 2 year survival was 81% for IVSK-treated patients and 65% for control patients (p = .05). There was no improvement in survival for patients with inferior myocardial infarction (p = .27). We conclude that patients with anterior myocardial infarction have improved survival when treated within the first 6 hr of symptoms. Patients with inferior infarction do not appear to have improved survival with thrombolytic therapy. Some of this improvement in survival in patients with anterior infarction may be due to a higher frequency of revascularization procedures in the treatment group.\r"

  ".U": "88109897\r", 
  ".W": "Conventional wall motion analysis of contrast ventriculograms assesses only that part of the wall that is tangential to the x-ray beam. To assess regional left ventricular function in three dimensions, a new computerized method based on densitometric analysis of digital subtraction left ventriculograms was developed and validated in nine open-chest dogs instrumented with a circumflex coronary artery occluder and sonomicrometers in the anterior and posterior walls. Each dog underwent digital subtraction ventriculography at baseline and at five levels (I to V) of dysfunction of the inferior wall induced by progressive stenoses of the circumflex coronary artery. The ventriculogram was divided into six segments around the end-diastolic center of gravity. Time-volume curves were obtained by densitometry in the normal anterior and ischemic inferior segments containing the sonomicrometers. From these curves, regional ejection fraction (R-EF), regional peak ejection rate (R-PER), and regional phase (R-PH) and amplitude (R-AMP) of the first Fourier harmonic were derived. From baseline to level V of dysfunction, myocardial systolic shortening determined by sonomicrometry decreased by 124 +/- 34% of control (mean +/- SD; p less than .001) in the ischemic wall, while it increased by 12 +/- 19% (NS) in the normal wall. At the same time, R-EF, R-PER, and R-AMP decreased in the ischemic segment by 65 +/- 12%, 46 +/- 30%, and 45 +/- 15% of control, respectively (all p less than .01), while they remained unchanged or increased in the normal segment. R-PH was delayed by 14 +/- 5% (p less than .01) in the ischemic segment, but remained unchanged in the normal segment, reflecting the asynchrony of regional left ventricular contraction during ischemia. Densitometric indexes of regional function correlated well with sonomicrometric systolic shortening both in normal and ischemic segments, with r values of .84 for R-EF, .80 for R-AMP, .64 for R-PER, and .55 for R-PH (all p less than .0001). Thus, densitometric analysis of digital subtraction left ventriculograms allows three-dimensional assessment of the extent, velocity, and synchrony of regional left ventricular contraction. Densitometric indexes of regional contraction correlate well with direct measurements of myocardial systolic shortening and are useful in quantitating regional left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Determination of absolute lumen diameters has been shown to be useful in predicting the functional importance of a coronary stenosis. In this study, both single-plane and orthogonal biplane digital subtraction angiograms were obtained in human cadaver coronary arteries. A single absolute diameter was calculated at the site of greatest narrowing in 20 segments by two automated computerized algorithms. Minimum and maximum diameters at the site of the stenosis were measured from pathologic sections prepared after pressure fixation. Method 1, which determines the edges by means of the first derivative of the videodensity curve, derived absolute diameters that fell between the pathologic minimum and maximum in 10 of 20 segments. Method 2, which determines the edges by an average of the first and second derivatives of the videodensity change, derived absolute diameters that fell between the pathologic minimum and maximum diameters in 15 of 20 segments. Method 1 correlated well with the maximum pathologic diameter (r = .76) and less well with the minrmum pathologic diameter (r = .67). Method 2 correlated very well with the maximum pathologic diameter (r = .79) and also correlated well with the minimum pathologic diameter (r = .74). As would be expected, the computerized algorithms tended to overestimate the minimum pathologic diameter and to underestimate the maximum pathologic diameter. In six segments, two orthogonal views were analyzed; no further accuracy was discernible over single-plane determinations. Thus quantitative coronary angiography by digital subtraction angiography is sufficiently accurate to be of use in the measurement of the severity of a coronary stenosis.\r"

The resistance of trabecular bone to penetration was measured posteriorly, centrally, and anteriorly in each of the tibial and femoral condyles in 150 consecutive total knee arthroplasties. Forty-seven rheumatoid knees and 88 osteoarthritic knees were evaluated. The correlation of bone strength with selected clinical parameters was found to be too poor to predict bone strength. Tibial bone strength was lower in rheumatoid than in osteoarthritic knees. Steroid medication did not influence tibial bone strength in rheumatoid arthritis. The distribution of bone strength between the medial and lateral condyles was closely dependent on knee alignment, with high medial strength in varus knees. At the unloaded condyle, strength was reduced relative to the findings for normally aligned knees. At the tibia, strength decreased with depth from the resection surface, while at the femur the converse was true. Tibial bone strength, both condylar and overall average, was lower than values reported in studies of normal cadaver knees. Evaluation of the absolute bone strength at the tibial condyles suggested that the values too low to meet load-bearing requirements after well-aligned knee replacement were infrequent.\r"

For application, the two components, i.e., a sealer protein solution (mainly fibrinogen) and a thrombin solution, are mixed to produce the fibrin clot. The sealant may be applied with a needle, as a spray, or by premixing (e.g., with antibiotics, bone chips) for subsequent sealant application in cavities. While the positive effect of FS in normal wound healing has been conclusively demonstrated, its influence on bone healing remains controversial. The positive experimental results mostly refer to the early phase of bone healing in rabbits (cortical drill hole, autologous and heterologous (Kiel) cancellous transplants, osteotomies, osteochondral fractures) and dogs (cortical bone and spongiosa defects). Some authors observed no effects (in dogs, osteotomy) or delayed healing in artificial bone growth chambers with the use of heterologous sealant. FS was also applied in combination with implantation material (tricalcium phosphate and bone gelatin) to facilitate application. Clinical results are especially convincing as to osteochondral fractures, repair of the Achilles tendon, and in hemophiliacs. Fibrin sealant facilitates hemostasis, permits tissue fixation, enhances plasticity of granular implant material, and stimulates fibroblast growth. Although its direct osteogenic effect remains questionable, fibrin sealant is known to be an excellent tool in orthopedic and trauma surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Ankylosing spondylitis may affect the spine segmentally or diffusely. Because all the ligaments become ossified in the involved areas, fractures that occur through this involved segment traverse both bone and ligaments, producing an extremely unstable situation similar to a shearing type of fracture. With a pre-existing severe kyphosis, it may be dangerous to turn the patient to a supine position, because this opens up the fracture and can cause neurologic complications. The radiologic assessment of the spine in ankylosing spondylitis is difficult because the bone is frequently osteoporotic and the disc spaces are poorly outlined. Minor displacements should be looked for, as well as discontinuity of ossified ligaments (especially the interspinous ligaments). Of the seven patients reported in this series, six had fractures undiagnosed at the time of the preliminary examination. Therefore, patients known to have ankylosing spondylitis should be counseled regarding the possibility of a fracture, and if pain persists after an injury, they should be thoroughly investigated radiologically to rule out a potentially serious problem. Reduction of the displacement and stabilization is best achieved with a Luque rectangular rod system, and laminectomy is not indicated.\r"

Although colon carcinoma in the younger patient is uncommon, its prognosis is distinctly worse than in the adult population, because the preponderance of mucinous adenocarcinoma in children and young adults represents a more virulent type of colonic malignancy and because the delay in diagnosis contributes to a more advanced stage of the disease at the time of presentation. When dealing with symptoms potentially referrable to this disease, a thorough diagnostic work-up should ensue.\r"

Visualization of aspirated blood, the fail-safe for avoiding intravascular injection, is predictably problematic. A spectrum of injuries, sometimes permanent, to the gluteal region, distal extremities, perineum, and spinal cord probably results from inadvertent intra-arterial injection, possibly due to vascular occlusion by large crystals of the penicillin salt(s). Since the arterial injurie disproportionately affect infants, use of these preparations in that age group should be minimized. The corresponding intravenous injection probably is Hoigne's syndrome, a procaine-induced central nervous system syndrome. Though usually brief and transient complications may be profound, including coma, convulsions, and death. Careful attention to details of anatomy and manufacturer's recommendations is critical.\r"

Regulation of glucose production and utilization was investigated by observing the response to the administration of glucose, insulin plus glucose and 5-methylpyrazole 3-carboxylic acid. 3. Glucose administration suppressed hepatic glucose output as assessed by portal-venous concentration differences in control or surgically stressed rats. In contrast, glycaemia was increased and lactaemia decreased in the latter group. Portal-venous concentrations differences for lactate were unaffected. 4. Surgery increased plasma fatty acid concentrations and the antilipolytic response to glucose or glucose plus insulin was diminished. Post-operative increases in fatty acid concentrations were associated with inhibition of hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which was reversed by insulin, indicating a differential sensitivity of adipose tissue and liver to the hormone. 5. The model of surgical stress utilized, while affecting extrahepatic glucose disposal, did not elicit depletion of liver glycogen or inactivation of L-pyruvate kinase. 6. It is concluded that the initial response to uncomplicated abdominal surgery involves carbohydrate conservation rather than increased glucose production, with effects to decrease extrahepatic glucose uptake and hepatic glucose oxidation.\r"

  ".W": "1. To determine the relevance of renal circulatory abnormalities found in the immature spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) to the genetic hypertensive process, glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow were measured in conscious F2 rats, derived from cross-breeding SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), at 4, 11 and 16 weeks of age by determining the renal clearances of 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetra-acetate and 125I-hippuran respectively. Plasma renin activity was measured at 11 and 16 weeks of age. 2. Mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow increased between 4 and 11 weeks of age. Between 11 and 16 weeks the mean glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow did not alter, although the mean arterial pressure rose significantly. At 11 weeks of age, during the developmental phase of hypertension, a significant negative correlation between mean arterial pressure and both glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow was noted. However, by 16 weeks when the manifestations of genetic hypertension were more fully expressed, no correlation between mean arterial pressure and renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate was observed. Plasma renin activity was negatively correlated with both glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, but the relationship was stronger at 11 than at 16 weeks of age. 3. These results suggest that the reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, found in immature SHR, is genetically linked to the hypertension and may be of primary pathogenetic importance. It is proposed that the increased renal vascular resistance in these young animals stimulates the rise of systemic arterial pressure which returns renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate to normal.\r"

To examine whether insulin resistance in uraemia extends to amino acid metabolism, the effect of physiological hyperinsulinaemia on plasma amino acid concentrations was studied in 17 chronically uraemic and 28 healthy subjects by using the euglycaemic insulin clamp technique. 2. In six uraemic and seven control subjects, splanchnic and leg exchange of amino acids was quantified with hepatic and femoral venous catheterization, and in five uraemic and eight control subjects intracellular free amino acid concentrations were determined in muscle tissue obtained by needle biopsy. 3. In response to hyperinsulinaemia the plasma concentrations of all amino acids except alanine decreased by 10-50% in both uraemic and control subjects. Splanchnic alanine uptake declined by 20% and leg amino acid release tended to decrease in both groups. 4. The intracellular levels of all measured amino acids except alanine fell significantly and to a similar extent in uraemic and control subjects. 5. These results indicate that insulin-mediated alterations in regional amino acid exchange and in plasma and intracellular amino acid concentrations are similar in uraemic and control subjects. 6. It is concluded that tissue insensitivity to insulin in uraemia does not extend to uptake or release of amino acids and that resistance to insulin can be selective in its effect on different metabolic functions.\r"

We examined the effect of increasing levels of PEEP on EVLW in 20 to 25-kg pigs with acute respiratory failure induced by continuous infusion of live Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 X 10(8) organisms/20 kg.min). Animals were intubated, paralyzed, and ventilated at 15 ml/kg tidal volume and an FIO2 of 0.4. Pigs in group 1 were given 4 ml/kg.h of iv fluid (lactated Ringer's solution) with no PEEP administered. Animals in groups 2 through 5 were given 0, 4, 17, and 44 ml/kg.h of lactated Ringer's solution, respectively, and PEEP was added at 5-cm H2O increments per half-hour, starting one hour after beginning P. aeruginosa infusion. EVLW in PEEP animals was less than or equal to that in controls despite variation in the administration of lactated Ringer's solution. This suggests that PEEP may slow EVLW accumulation over time and provide a protective effect that allows increased amounts of crystalloid fluids to be administered.\r"

The aim of the present study was to investigate if elevation of circulating levels of adenosine influence bronchial tone or bronchial reactivity. Seven patients with bronchial asthma in whom bronchial hyperreactivity had been confirmed in a pretrial bronchial histamine challenge (PC20 FEV1 0.064 to 2.45 mg/ml) received intravenous infusions of adenosine in increasing doses (10, 30 and 50 micrograms/kg/min, 6 min on each dose step) or placebo (saline solution) on two different days in a randomized, single-blind manner. Heart rate, blood pressure and lung function (lung volumes, flow-volume loops and airway conductance) were measured on each dose step. Infusion rate was held constant (at 50 micrograms/kg/min) throughout the trial and a bronchial methacholine challenge was performed during the infusion of adenosine or placebo. Infusions of adenosine and placebo did not influence heart rate, blood pressure or bronchial tone on either day and bronchial reactivity was similar on both days. We conclude that bronchial tone and bronchial reactivity in asthmatic patients are not increased by intravenously administered adenosine at a dose level which, in other studies, has been shown to induce regional effects in the systemic arterial circulation.\r"

Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine, expressed as the dose of inhaled methacholine required to provoke a 20 percent fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (PD20 FEV1), was measured before and after BAL. We found no evidence for the induction of responsiveness by BAL in 11 control subjects with negative methacholine tests prior to the procedure. There were small but significant falls in FEV1 following BAL in both the control group and in patients with airflow obstruction. Thus, BAL does not appear to induce nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness in subjects without airflow obstruction, nor does it affect airway responsiveness in emphysema patients. Among asthmatics, bronchial responsiveness can be increased as a result of BAL; this increase was greatest in patients who were most responsive initially.\r"

The potential for the sudden inadvertent application of a high, unremitting pressure support breath or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) clearly exists with some ventilators and is illustrated in two cases. The potentially adverse consequences of high levels of CPAP are predictable and have been well described. Standard ventilator monitoring systems which do not include mean airway pressure monitoring may not detect this problem before significant adverse consequences have occurred. Even when detected, this unfamiliar complication may be difficult to recognize by the uninitiated. Physicians utilizing this mode of ventilation must be familiar with the terminating mechanism of their particular ventilator and choose appropriate monitoring.\r"

Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean stroke volume index for the group at the time of study were 27 +/- 3 mm Hg and 27.9 +/- 8.9 ml/m2, respectively. Mean MMEFR was 71 percent of normal and mean delta to FEV1% was 76.3 percent. Only one patient, who was a 50-pack-year smoker, had a greater than 20 percent decrease in FEV1 with methacholine challenge, and this was at the highest concentration (25 mg/ml). We conclude that, in stable CHF, bronchial reactivity as assessed by standard methacholine challenge is not increased.\r"

  ".W": "Esmolol is a new intravenous beta-adrenergic blocker with an ultrashort (nine-minute) elimination half-life, which has been studied predominantly for control of supraventricular tachycardia and management of certain types of hypertension. Clinical studies indicate that the efficacy of esmolol is equivalent to that of propranolol and verapamil for control of supraventricular tachycardia and to sodium nitroferricyanide (sodium nitroprusside) for control of postoperative hypertension. Esmolol also has been shown to control heart rate and blood pressure during episodes of acute myocardial ischemia. Cardioselectivity is similar to that of metoprolol, and the ability to titrate the effect of esmolol may provide additional assurance that beta-adrenergic blockade will remain within the cardioselective range. The most commonly observed adverse effect seen in clinical trials was asymptomatic hypotension. Hypotension may be minimized by titrating to the minimum effective dose and is readily reversed within 10 to 30 minutes of discontinuing the infusion of esmolol. These unique features represent advantages of great potential merit in critical care medicine.\r"

Tobacco has been glibly referred to as a form of revenge by native Indians. There is little similarity between ceremonial use of tobacco by the Indians and the robotic puffing of the modern smoker. The real culprit is the cigarette.\r"

  ".W": "The multifaceted nature of smoking includes its physiologic, social, and psychologic dimensions and its career features. It develops over time, through phases such as experimentation or conditioning. It also is given up over time, often after several unsuccessful attempts. Several repetitions of a sequence of considering cessation, attempting to quit, and relapsing are likely to precede permanent cessation. Those who are not ready to commit themselves to quitting may be reached by low-key information more than by too forceful exhortation. Those who are ready to quit may select from among a range of approaches, including group clinics, \"self-help\" manuals, and physician counseling. Maintenance requires as much attention as does cessation. Cooperation from those around the quitter, reminders to use skills for coping with stressors or temptations, and continued encouragement from the physician may all encourage long-term abstinence. Owing to the multifaceted nature of smoking and quitting and the multiple approaches to cessation and its maintenance, the physician may best be viewed as a catalyst for nonsmoking. If appropriate to his or her practice, this may include extended patient counseling, but those unable to provide this may still make great contributions through brief information on why it is important to quit, encouragement to do so, timely referral to other staff or to materials and programs available in the community, and continued expression of interest in the patient's efforts and/or success. All these may catalyze quitting without demanding excessive time or skills beyond those commonly employed by the physician. In catalyzing nonsmoking, the physician can also be an effective proponent of community or voluntary agency programs as well as institutional and governmental policies to limit smoking in health care facilities and public places. The American College of Chest Physicians' policy encouraging nonsmoking among its Fellows and in their offices is an excellent example of this catalyst role.\r"

Seven patients with complex fistulas-in-ano were treated by this method. Six were cured and had excellent functional results up to 32 +/- 36 months postoperatively. The time to complete healing was 2.1 +/- 0.75 months. One patient developed a recurrent abscess.

Three instances of diverticulitis were complicated by free perforation in two cases, and by colovesical fistula in one. Appendicitis occurred in two cases. The other complications were hemorrhage (from diverticulosis or angiodysplasia), nonspecific colitis, and ischemic colitis. Spontaneous colonic perforation did not occur. Two thirds of the colonic complications occurred within 30 days after transplantation. All cases of colon perforation, however, occurred later than one month after transplantation. It is concluded that pseudomembranous colitis is the most common colonic complication in renal transplant recipients, that it usually occurs early, and that it carries a good prognosis. Colonic perforations occurred later in this series and were treated successfully. All cases of ischemic colitis were part of terminal multiorgan system failure.\r"

The study consisted of an analysis of 316 case reports and collective reviews of adenocarcinoma of the appendix that were reported in the literature between 1960 and 1985. The mean age of patients with this disease was 57.1 years and the male-to-female ratio for adenocarcinoma of the appendix was 1.4:1. Only rarely was a malignancy suspected, as 68 percent of the patients presented with signs and symptoms of inflammatory disease of the appendix. The tumor was perforated in 55 percent of patients, making it the most frequently perforating carcinoma of the entire gastrointestinal tract. One half of these perforations were localized as abscesses. The presence of perforation did not necessarily predispose a poor prognosis. Synchronous appendiceal and other colonic neoplasms occurred in 2.7 percent of patients. Pseudomyxoma peritonei occurred as a presenting feature in 5.6 percent of patients and was generally a poor prognostic indicator. Carcinomatosis peritonei was found at initial exploration in 10.3 percent of patients and these patients rarely survived one year.\r"

There are, however, theoretical grounds for the belief that both levels are important. The authors therefore conducted a random control trial in 119 consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal operations, comparing the results in a group receiving purely parenteral antimicrobial prophylaxis with those in one having a combined oral and parenteral regimen. The results in 83 contemporary nonrandomized patients, all of whom had the combined prophylactic regimen, are also reported. Oral bowel preparation resulted in a significantly smaller number of operation cultures showing growth of fecal gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes than did the purely parenteral regimen. There were more isolations of enterococci in the combined group but the excess did not achieve statistical significance. The rates of infective complications were higher in the parenteral than in the combined group, the difference in wound infection rates being statistically significant; the figures were 27.6 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively (P = .04). It is concluded that, in colorectal operations, it is advisable not only to ensure adequate tissue levels of antimicrobials but also to reduce the risk of endogenous bacterial infection by partially decontaminating the bowel.\r"

Gallbladder volume was determined by means of real-time ultrasonography, using a linear array scanner with a 3.5 MHZ probe. In seven of the obese patients, gallbladder contractility was also evaluated after a 10-day regimen with Modifast. The obese group showed a statistically significant greater gallbladder fasting volume and blunted contractility than controls both after the ordinary and the low-calorie meal. The 10-day low-calorie regimen was associated with a statistically significant increment in fasting gallbladder volume, while the percent volume reduction after Modifast did not change. It is suggested that, in addition to metabolic factors, gallbladder hypocontractility in the obese may contribute to the high incidence of cholesterol gallstones noted in these patients. A low-calorie, low-fat diet augmenting gallbladder volume may favor bile stasis and therefore the likelihood of developing gallstones.\r"

The sensitivity of US was 90%; specificity was 93.3%. Serum AFP level greater than or equal to 500 ng/ml (RIA) was the first clue to the diagnosis in 71 patients (48.6%); specificity was 100%. In 28 patients AFP levels became significantly elevated during follow-up after US detection of HCC. No relationship between echo pattern and serum AFP levels was demonstrated.

Using the model of gastric mucosal injury in the rat with ethanol, we have found that mucosal injury could be detected at a time when tissue oxygenation as determined by biochemical, and pharmacological studies of ATP metabolism were not compatible with ischemia. We also found that drugs acting at different subcellular levels were able to both inhibit gastric acid secretion in 4 hour pylorus-ligated rats and gastric mucosal injury after ethanol. Certain drugs, such as histamine and pentagastrin, stimulated acid secretion but inhibited the injury to the mucosa by ethanol indicating that increased cellular activity could occur during the development of mucosal injury.\r"

This study examines first the relationship between number (dose) of peristaltic contractions applied to the mucosa and the ulcer score. Second, it examines the relative roles of: altered gastric myoelectrical activity (MEA) resulting from indomethacin (Indo) pretreatment, insulin-induced gastric peristalsis, and a combination of the two in the generation of mucosal lesions. Third, it examines the effect of exogenous prostaglandin on the Indo-altered MEA and relates it to ulcerogenesis. Indo pretreatment increased gastric tone and MEA. In such animals, the dose of peristaltic contractions applied to the gastric wall was related to the ulcer score in a dose-dependent manner. Exogenous prostaglandin (PG) reversed the MEA effect of Indo and reduced ulceration. It is postulated that an altered smooth muscle state secondary to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (PG-S) renders the mucosa vulnerable to injury by peristaltic action.\r"

Blood glucose concentrations decreased significantly in the diabetic subjects but remained constant in the control subjects. During the run, plasma free fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and alanine concentrations behaved similarly in both groups. Only postexercise ketosis was more pronounced in the diabetic subjects. Peripheral serum free-insulin concentrations were slightly lower in the diabetic subjects at the start of the study, but these insulin concentrations became significantly elevated afterward compared with the control subjects. Plasma glucagon levels increased in the diabetic but not in the control subjects. Growth hormone levels increased sharply and to significantly higher levels in the diabetic than in the control subjects, who presented a slow gradual increase. Plasma cortisol levels were slightly, but at some moments significantly, higher in the diabetic subjects. The plasma catecholamine concentrations increased in both groups but to significantly higher levels in the diabetic subjects.

Sixty-three men and 86 women from a total adult population of 330 were tested. Of the people tested, 67.6% had normal glucose tolerance, 25% had IGT, and 7.4% had diabetes. Both diabetes and IGT were strongly age related. Fasting insulin levels and insulin responses to oral glucose (elevation above basal) were elevated. Although fasting insulin rose with age, insulin response did not rise after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). Plasma triglyceride levels were high, particularly in men greater than 35 yr old (3.13 +/- 0.32 mM), but cholesterol levels were not elevated. Multiple regression analysis of fasting glucose, 2-h glucose, plasma triglyceride, fasting insulin, and insulin response for the nondiabetic subjects revealed 1) BMI was an independent risk factor for elevated 2-h glucose levels in women but not in men and was strongly related to fasting insulin concentrations in both genders; 2) fasting insulin concentration was an independent risk factor for increases in fasting glucose, insulin response, and triglyceride levels; 3) insulin response was related to the 2-h glucose level; 4) fasting and 2-h glucose levels and fasting insulin and triglyceride concentrations all rose with age in both genders, with the rate of increase generally greater in men. The most striking difference between these desert Aborigines and previously studied coastal Aborigines from the same geographical region was the significantly higher insulin response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that with the injection technique presently recommended to diabetic patients, accidental intramuscular injection of insulin is liable to occur quite frequently. In this study, the simultaneous absorption of 125I-labeled soluble human insulin (5 U) from subcutaneous and intramuscular injection sites in the thigh and abdomen was measured for 3 h in 10 insulin-dependent diabetic subjects to evaluate the importance of accidental intramuscular injection for insulin absorption in the resting state. Injection sites were located with computed tomography of the thigh and abdomen. From a superficial part of the thigh musculature, the absorption rate was at least 50% higher than from the adjacent subcutaneous tissue, the time until 50% of the initial activity remained (t1/2) being 123 +/- 14 and greater than 180 min, respectively (P less than .001). No difference in absorption rates was found between the two tissues in the abdomen (t1/2 84 +/- 6 vs. 93 +/- 7 min, NS). The results suggest that in the thigh, accidental intramuscular injections will considerably increase the variability of insulin absorption and may impair glycemic control in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Furthermore, the influence of accidental intramuscular injection on insulin absorption seems to vary among injection regions.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups that were comparable for age, sex distribution, type of diabetes, and type of surgical procedures. The results show that intravenous insulin administration achieved better glycemic control during the intraoperative period, whereas it did not offer advantages over the subcutaneous route during the pre- and postoperative periods. The satisfactory degree of steady glycemic control achieved and the absence of hypoglycemic episodes indicate that the separate administration of insulin and glucose plus electrolytes is an effective and safe management modality for diabetic patients undergoing major surgery.\r"

Allergy was systemic (urticaria and nonthrombocytopenic purpura) and local delayed in two subjects and local immediate or biphasic in six subjects. Lipoatrophy was present in two subjects. After treatment with human semisynthetic insulin (Monotard HM and Actrapid HM), systemic allergy disappeared. Local allergy disappeared in five subjects and was reduced in three subjects. No lipoatrophy occurred in new injection areas. The clinical results were accompanied by a significant decrease in serum insulin-specific IgE after 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 mo. Insulin-specific IgG showed an evident decrease in five of eight patients, but the difference in mean values was not significant after 6, 18, 24, 30, and 36 mo. With one exception, intradermal skin tests were positive to human, bovine, and porcine insulin before and after human insulin treatment.\r"

Group one (16 patients) ingested 500 g of broiled nopal stems. Group 2 (10 patients) received only 400 ml of water as a control test. Three tests were performed on group 3 (6 patients): one with nopal, a second with water, and a third with ingestion of 500 g broiled squash. Serum glucose and insulin levels were measured at 0, 60, 120, and 180 min. After the intake of O. streptacantha Lem., serum glucose and serum insulin levels decreased significantly in groups 1 and 3, whereas no similar changes were noticed in group 2. The mean reduction of glucose reached 17.6 +/- 2.2% of basal values at 180 min in group 1 and 16.2 +/- 1.8% in group 3; the reduction of serum insulin at 180 min reached 50.2 +/- 8.0% in group 1 and 40.3 +/- 12.4% in group 3. This study shows that the stems of O. streptacantha Lem. cause a hypoglycemic effect in patients with NIDDM. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but an increased insulin sensitivity is suggested.\r"

The greater increase in insulin could be explained largely, but not entirely, by the protein and fructose in the mixed meal (85%) which, in addition to glucose, are known insulin secretagogues. The residual unexplained increase may be due to a synergistic interaction of these secretagogues, an unidentified insulin secretagogue, or by a reduced insulin removal rate. These possibilities remain to be explored.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing interest in the possibility that diabetes mellitus may be associated with a series of neurobehavioral, or neuropsychological, changes; i.e., learning, memory, problem solving, mental and motor speed, and eye-hand coordination may sometimes be disrupted in diabetic children and adults, and this disruption may be a consequence of certain disease-related variables. To date, four neurobehavioral risk factors have been identified. For children and adolescents, the most potent risk factors appear to be age at diagnosis and the occurrence of schoolroom-related problems. Children who develop diabetes early in life are more likely to show serious cognitive impairments on virtually all measures. In addition, diabetic children with school attendance problems tend to score lower than expected on verbal IQ tests and school achievement tests. For adults, the most carefully studied risk factor is degree of metabolic control. Adults in poor control are far more likely to manifest subtle changes on measures of mental efficiency. This may be particularly evident on tasks that require the development and deployment of sophisticated information-processing strategies. A fourth variable--severe episodes of hypoglycemia--is known to disrupt functioning in diabetic subjects of any age, although it has not yet been studied systematically in large-scale studies. Indeed, because virtually all extant studies have been based on limited neurobehavioral and biomedical assessments of relatively few volunteer subjects, this list of risk factors must be considered tentative at best.\r"

In the present paper radioactive calcium uptake was studied in the mammary gland during terminal differentiation, when lactogenesis was initiated. Under these conditions a relevant accumulation of calcium in the tissue was clearly demonstrable. We have characterized the calcium uptake by the tissue as a saturable and energy dependent process. When 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3], the major calcium regulator hormone, was added to the incubation medium the secosteroid strongly stimulated this process by increasing the maximal velocity without significantly altering the Michaelis Menten constant (Km). Detectable increases in calcium uptake could be measured after the explants were cultured with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 30 min, with the response continuing to increase sharply over time and reaching a plateau at 3 h. The increase was not affected by the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide suggesting that the 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of calcium uptake may be independent of de novo protein synthesis. These results provide evidence for early and direct action of the hormonal form of vitamin D in affecting calcium transport across membranes of functionally differentiated epithelial cells of the mammary gland.\r"

Leu-enkephalin significantly increased aldosterone production in a dose-dependent manner (10(-10)-10(-7) M). Similar results on steroidogenesis were obtained with the synthetic opioid D-Ala2,D-Leu5-enkephalin, whereas much higher concentrations of Met-enkephalin were required. Peptide E did not affect steroidogenesis. Naltrexone or naloxone (10(-5) M) potentiated the effect of Leu-enkephalin on aldosterone secretion. The effect of a general opioid antagonist (diprenorphine) or an agonist (etorphine) was also studied. The stimulation by Leu-enkephalin of aldosterone secretion was only partially blocked by diprenorphine. Etorphine (10(-6) and 10(-8) M) had no effect on basal steroidogenesis. It is proposed that the stimulatory effect of Leu-enkephalin on aldosterone production could be mediated by a different receptor than the classical opioid receptors presently known.\r"

  ".W": "GH has acute stimulatory effects on amino acid transport and protein synthesis in a variety of tissues, but it has not been established whether these effects are expressions of the growth-promoting property of GH or of its separate insulin-like action. The 20,000-dalton structural variant of human GH (20K hGH) has been shown to have a high ratio of growth-promoting to insulin-like activity compared to native hGH (22K hGH), suggesting that it could be used as a tool to address the above question. Therefore, experiments were conducted to compare the relative abilities of native 22K hGH and 20K hGH, when added in vitro, to stimulate amino acid transport and protein synthesis in the isolated diaphragm of the female hypophysectomized rat. Paired intact hemidiaphragms were preincubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of various concentrations of 22K or 20K hGH. Then, 3-O-[14C]methylglucose was added to the medium to measure sugar transport as a test of insulin-like activity, and either alpha-[3H]aminoisobutyric acid acid or [3H] phenylalanine was also added to measure amino acid transport or protein synthesis, respectively, during a final hour of incubation. When the responses to the various concentrations of 22K and 20K were compared, 20K hGH was only about 20% as effective as 22K in stimulating 3-O-methylglucose transport, reflecting its markedly attenuated insulin-like activity on the diaphragm. Similarly, 20K hGH was only 20% as effective as 22K hGH in stimulating alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport and phenylalanine incorporation into protein in the same muscles. Therefore, these findings support the idea that the rapid stimulatory effects of GH on amino acid transport and protein synthesis are expressions of the insulin-like action of GH and are not components of the response of target cells to its growth-promoting action.\r"

We investigated the changes in the LH subunits during the stimulatory and down-regulatory phases of GnRH action in rat pituitary cell monolayer culture. The rat pituitary cells in culture, pretreated with medium alone or GnRH agonist for 48 h, were incubated with graded doses of GnRH for 4 h, and LH, LH alpha, and LH beta concentrations in the media and cell pellets were measured by specific and sensitive RIAs. Cells pretreated with medium alone responded to GnRH with a dose-dependent increase in LH, LH alpha, and LH beta immunoreactivity in the medium. However, rat LH, LH alpha, and LH beta concentrations in the cell pellets showed a dose-dependent decrease with GnRH treatment. Pretreatment with GnRH agonist led to a marked decrease in the LH response of cells to graded doses of GnRH. During this down-regulatory phase, the concentrations of LH beta in the medium remained undetectable even though LH alpha immunoreactivity remained persistently and disproportionately elevated. These data suggest that the alpha- and beta-subunits of rat LH are both coordinately and differentially regulated. During the stimulatory phase of GnRH action, both subunits rise concordantly, but during the down-regulatory phase the secretion of the two subunits becomes unbalanced. The changes in the beta-subunit closely parallel the changes in the concentrations of LH dimer, pointing to the key role of beta-subunit in regulation of LH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We randomized 32 cycling female Sprague-Dawley rats (82 days old) into experimental and control groups (16 animals/group). Hyperinsulinemia was induced and maintained for 22 days in the experimental group with NPH human insulin (Novolin, Squibb-Novo, Princeton, NJ) as previously described. Controls received an identical volume of vehicle. Fifteen minutes before death, each rat received a sc injection of 100 ng synthetic GnRH (Factrel, Ayerst Laboratories, New York, NY). The mean serum insulin level was significantly higher in the insulin-treated group than in the control group (165 +/- 57 vs. 49 +/- 9 microU/ml; P less than 0.05). The mean final weight also was significantly higher in the insulin-treated group (283 +/- 4 vs. 242 +/- 7 g; P less than 0.001). There were no significant differences in mean final serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, estrone, or androstenedione or in GnRH-stimulated serum levels of LH or FSH. The androstenedione to estrone ratio, however, was significantly lower in the insulin-treated group (2.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.2; P less than 0.01), suggesting that aromatase activity increased with hyperinsulinemia. Specific [125I]insulin binding to ovarian tissue homogenates was lower in the insulin-treated group (1.7 +/- 0.1% vs. 2.6 +/- 0.6%/0.2 mg protein; P greater than 0.05), suggesting that ovarian insulin receptors tended to down-regulate with hyperinsulinemia. Specific [125I]insulin-like growth factor I [( 125I]IGF-I) binding to ovarian tissue homogenates, in contrast, was significantly higher in the insulin-treated group (13.3 +/- 1.4% vs. 7.2 +/- 0.6%/0.2 mg protein; P less than 0.05), suggesting that ovarian IGF receptors up-regulated with hyperinsulinemia. The affinity of neither [125I]insulin binding nor that of [125I]IGF-I binding changed significantly, with the 50% inhibition point remaining between 2.0 and 5.0 ng/ml for each peptide in both groups. We conclude that hyperinsulinemia increases ovarian [125I]IGF-I binding and stimulates aromatase activity in the rat. These phenomena, if also true in women, could be important factors contributing to the ovarian hyperstimulation observed in various hyperinsulinemic states.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of alloxan-induced diabetes on uterine decidualization and the associated changes in uterine blood flow (UBF) and corpus luteum activity were evaluated in rats between days 4-9 of pseudopregnancy (day 0 = ovulation). Rats were made diabetic (D) with a 40 mg/kg injection (iv) of alloxan on day 1 of pseudopregnancy. Saline-treated rats served as controls (C). Uterine weights were depressed in D rats between days 6-7 of pseudopregnancy in association with elevated blood glucose levels (greater than 300 mg/dl) relative to control values. UBF rates were also depressed in D rats between days 6-7 of pseudopregnancy compared with control values. Insulin replacement therapy (6 IU bovine/day) effectively normalized both uterine weight and UBF in diabetic rats. Decidual tissue (DT) growth was impaired in D rats between days 7 and 9 of pseudopregnancy (DT induction on day 4 of pseudopregnancy) compared with controls. Tissue blood flow rates were severely depressed throughout pseudopregnancy in D rats, but insulin treatment normalized both uterine parameters to control levels. Serum progesterone levels were lower in D rats than in controls between days 7 and 9 of pseudopregnancy. Daily insulin treatment normalized luteal function to control levels. The depressed DT weights in D rats were mimicked by the experimental reduction of DT blood flow in control rats. These results indicate that the uterine atrophy and poor endometrial decidualization that characterized the D rat are accompanied by impaired UBF and luteal activity. These findings suggest that the D-associated depression in female reproductive performance is related to the lack of proper hormone support of tissue vascular dynamics.\r"

  ".U": "88111412\r", 
  ".W": "Stimulation of the primate corpus luteum by endogenous CG in early pregnancy or by exogenous CG in simulated conditions is transient despite continued exposure to this luteotropic hormone. The transitory response to CG is not due to the down-regulation of gonadotropin receptors. The current studies were designed to determine if the transient response involves a postreceptor lesion at the membrane level, i.e. the loss of CG receptor activation of adenylate cyclase. Nonpregnant female rhesus monkeys received increasing doses of hCG for up to 10 days beginning near the typical time of implantation (9 days post-LH surge) to simulate early pregnancy. Corpora lutea were removed at specific intervals after the onset of hCG treatment, luteal homogenates were prepared, and adenylate cyclase activity was assessed by the conversion of [alpha-32P]ATP to [32P] cAMP. Basal activity of adenylate cyclase was unchanged throughout the in vivo hCG treatment interval. Nonhormonal activators, such as forskolin (100 microM) and 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (50 microM) stimulated (P less than 0.05) adenylate cyclase to a similar extent (greater than 10-fold the control level) throughout hCG treatment. On day 0, both gonadotropins (hCG and human LH; 250 nM) and prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2; 500 nM) stimulated cAMP production (approximately 3-fold the control level; P less than 0.05). The responses of adenylate cyclase to PGE2 and PGI2 did not diminish throughout the in vivo hCG treatment. In contrast, exposure to hCG for 3 days reduced the sensitivity of adenylate cyclase to gonadotropin. Moreover, adenylate cyclase in luteal tissue after 6-10 days of treatment was insensitive to hCG. The loss of gonadotropin sensitivity of adenylate cyclase by 6 days of hCG treatment correlated with the decline in circulating progesterone levels. These results demonstrate that 1) the gonadotropin-responsive adenylate cyclase of the macaque corpus luteum is also stimulated by paracrine factors, notably PGs of the E and I series; and 2) CG exposure stimulating early pregnancy conditions leads to homologous, not heterologous, desensitization of the adenylate cyclase system. We hypothesize that homologous desensitization of the adenylate cyclase system is an important mechanism leading to the transient response of the primate corpus luteum to CG in early pregnancy.\r"

  ".U": "88111414\r", 
  ".W": "Immunohistochemical evidence has indicated that beta-endorphin (beta EP) is present in the Leydig cells of fetal, neonatal, and adult mice and hamsters. In vivo experiments suggest that hCG and/or testosterone may increase the synthesis and release of the peptide from the Leydig cell compartment. Since cultured fetal Leydig cells have considerable potential for long term studies and elucidation of trophic hormone actions in vitro, we evaluated beta EP production in this system. Fetal Leydig cells were maintained in culture for 5 days in medium with 1 microgram ovine LH added every third day in the presence or absence of inhibitors of cholesterol (aminoglutethimide) or pregnenolone metabolism (cyanoketone and spironolactone), or known regulators of beta EP production [dexamethasone (DEX)]. Media were assayed for testosterone and beta EP by RIA methods. Beta EP accumulation over 3 and 5 days was markedly increased by inhibitors of steroid biosynthesis (1.5-fold) and reduced by DEX only after treatment for 5 days (by 50%). Acute hCG stimulation significantly increased beta EP levels by 5- to 9-fold in all conditions tested. Inhibition of Leydig cell steroid biosynthesis markedly increased basal and hCG-stimulated beta EP output (by 150-200%). In contrast, DEX reduced basal and hCG-stimulated beta EP production (by approximately 50%). HPLC analysis of cultured pooled media revealed that the beta EP immunoreactivity eluted at the retention time of authentic rat beta EP. The pattern of beta EP stimulation was not reflected by testosterone levels that were low or undetectable in controls and under conditions in which spironolactone/cyanoketone or aminoglutethimide were present; most importantly, inhibition of steroid biosynthesis markedly increased beta EP levels. In addition, beta EP (10(-7) M) did not affect testosterone production, and opiate binding was not detected on Leydig cells. The lack of degradation of this opioid peptide in the fetal cultures contrasted with results from adult cultures and provided an ideal system for studies of the regulation of this peptide in Leydig cells. These results demonstrate that beta EP is released from fetal Leydig cells in culture and that acute stimulation of Leydig cells by hCG can enhance beta EP secretion. These changes are not mediated by testosterone. In contrast, testosterone or its metabolites may exert negative autocrine modulation of beta EP production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This abnormality can be demonstrated with dynamic tests of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis and by measuring seminal plasma androgen levels. A high proportion of oligozoospermic men who have abnormal hormone profiles will respond favorably to correction of their varicosities. Several oligozoospermic men with varicoceles have normal hormonal profiles. To date, in our unit, none of these men has had an improvement in seminal characteristics after varicocelectomy. This result would suggest that these men have incidental varicoceles. It is not clear what the testicular defect is leading to abnormal spermatogenesis in these men. Clearly, more studies are required in this group of men and in the men with sperm densities greater than 30 X 10(6)/ml, the majority of whom have normal responses to GnRH infusion. More information is needed regarding the intratesticular control of hormone production and spermatogenesis. As our knowledge of the paracrine system within the testis increases, so should our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the association of varicoceles and infertility.\r"

Basal measurements of immuno-PRL, bio-PRL, and the ratio of bio/immuno-PRL were similar in PCO and controls. The immuno-PRL decrement after DA was greater than that of bio-PRL in both groups (P less than 0.05). After MCP, immuno-PRL increased more than bio-PRL in PCO (P less than 0.01), and this immuno-PRL increment was greater than that of controls (P less than 0.05). Bio-PRL and immuno-PRL increased after GnRH in PCO, but not controls, and these responses were inhibited by disulfiram.

The method is easily mastered and the oocyte yield of this method is already high, even though it is early in the learning phase of the procedure. The mean duration of the procedure decreased from more than 30 minutes to less than 20 minutes in the first 7 months after the introduction of this technique in the IVF program.

  ".W": "A number of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli strains isolated from sporadic cases of hemorrhagic colitis in the United States over the last 5 yr were shown to belong to serogroups other than 0157:H7-the serotype originally implicated in this disease. Experimental infection of gnotobiotic piglets with five such strains (0111:NM, 0145:NM, 045:H2, 04:NM, and Ound:NM) caused diarrhea resulting from mucosal lesions in the cecum and colon that were indistinguishable from those previously described in piglets infected with E. coli 0157:H7. This suggests that, as with other categories of pathogenic E. coli, several serotypes cause hemorrhagic colitis in humans. The five E. coli strains that were compared with one 0157:H7 strain and with an enteropathogenic calf strain (serotype 05:NM) caused a spectrum of disease ranging from moderate diarrhea (0157:H7) to severe illness (including septicemia and death) (0111:NM). Characteristic lesions, which were identical for all seven pathogenic strains, included bacterial attachment, effacement of the microvillus border, and dissolution of the cell membranes of surface and glandular epithelium, resulting in complete cell destruction. Some piglets exhibited neurologic signs of convulsions and ataxia. It is concluded that a number of E. coli serotypes, in addition to 0157:H7, fulfill the present limited criteria for enterohemorrhagic E. coli, which include association with hemorrhagic colitis, production of one or more verotoxins, possession of a large plasmid (50-70 megadaltons), and induction of distinct mucosal lesions in the large bowel of gnotobiotic piglets.\r"

  ".W": "Stress in humans commonly results in gastrointestinal dysfunction, which is characterized by its symptomatology because the etiology is completely unknown. We developed an animal model in which to study the effects of stress on the gastrointestinal tract, and characterized the model as a stressor by evaluating endocrine and analgesic responses to mild restraint. Mild restraint (wrap restraint) elevated plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and beta-endorphin, and caused analgesia. The different regions of the gastrointestinal tract responded differently to the stress stimulus. Gastric emptying was not affected, small intestinal transit was inhibited, and large intestinal transit was stimulated by stress, and there was an associated increase in fecal excretion. Wrap-restraint stress did not result in the formation of ulcers. There was a strong correlation between stress-induced adrenocorticotropic hormone release and stress-induced intestinal dysfunction over a 24-h period that suggested a circadian influence. However, neither exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone nor beta-endorphin had any effect on intestinal transit. Furthermore, neither adrenalectomy nor hypophysectomy prevented the response of the intestine to stress, suggesting that neither adrenal nor pituitary-derived factors are responsible for mediating the effects of stress on the gut. We conclude that wrap-restraint stress produces different effects on different regions of the intestine, suggesting that the small and large intestines are independently regulated and can respond differently to different stimuli. There were similarities between the intestinal effects of wrap-restraint stress in rats and intestinal symptoms associated with stress and irritable bowel syndrome in humans. Therefore, wrap restraint may be an appropriate animal model in which to study stress-related intestinal dysfunction. The mechanisms by which stress affects intestinal transit are still unresolved; however, the intestinal effects of stress are not mediated by either pituitary or adrenally derived factors.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we evaluated by blinded design the diagnostic efficacy of two noninvasive techniques, quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy (QHS) and fatty-meal sonography (FMS), for evaluating patients with suspected partial common duct obstruction. Quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy was performed on 56 cholecystectomized individuals (22 asymptomatic controls, 28 patients with suspected partial common duct obstruction, and 6 nonjaundiced cirrhotics) and FMS was done in 51 cases. For QHS, time-activity curves were generated for regions of interest over the liver, hepatic hilum, and common duct. For FMS, we measured common duct diameter before and 45 min after a fatty meal (Lipomul, 1.5 ml/kg). Each of the 28 patients with suspected partial common duct obstruction and 6 cirrhotic patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, often accompanied by sphincter of Oddi manometry. Findings from these examinations were taken as the gold standard to determine the presence or absence of conditions that could account for intermittent symptomatic partial common duct obstruction. The most sensitive indicators for a positive test were a 45-min isotope clearance of less than 63% for QHS and a common duct increase of greater than or equal to 2 mm after the fatty meal for FMS. Of 28 patients with suspected partial common duct obstruction, 15 were judged to be true-positive and 13 true-negative. The 6 cirrhotic patients were without common duct obstruction. The study findings showed that each test had a 67% sensitivity that improved to 80% when the findings from both test results were combined. The specificity of QHS was 85% and that of FMS was 100%. All 6 cirrhotic patients had negative findings on FMS and 4 were false-positive on QHS. The true-positives included 8 patients with a small common duct stone and 6 with obstructive sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (4 stenosis, 2 dyskinesia). We conclude that noninvasive QHS and FMS afford good sensitivity and specificity for evaluating cholecystectomized patients with suspected partial common duct obstruction.\r"

Rabbits were given killed nonpathogenic Escherichia coli intraportally or intravenously. The animals to which a mixture of killed E. coli and rabbit antiserum (aggregated E. coli) was given intraportally developed remarkable histologic changes in the liver. The early inflammatory reactions in the portal area and parenchyma were followed by rapid disappearance of inflammation and development of portal fibrosis with bile duct proliferation. Three intraportal challenges with aggregated E. coli were sufficient to produce pronounced portal fibrosis, although there was considerable variation in response among individual animals. This procedure also produced splenomegaly, and in some animals marked portal hypertension. Injection of nonaggregated killed E. coli into the portal vein or aggregated E. coli into the ear vein also caused similar hepatic changes, but they were milder in degree. These histologic changes resemble portal fibrosis seen in idiopathic portal hypertension and, less closely, pericholangitis associated with inflammatory bowel disease in humans.\r"

Radiographic abnormalities demonstrating osteoarthrosis of the lumbar spine and facet joints and varying degrees of disk bulge and disk degeneration are the rule in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Therefore, clinical assessments rather than purely morphological assessments are necessary to assess treatment plans and prognosis in elderly low back pain patients. Osteoarthritic changes are more often asymptomatic than symptomatic. CT and MRI demonstrations of spinal stenosis should be correlated with clinical findings to determine appropriate management decisions. Most elderly patients with low back pain with or without sciatica and with only radiographic CT or MRI rather than clinical evidence of spinal stenosis can be successfully managed conservatively.\r"

Calcium-channel blockers address the pathophysiologic mechanisms of generic hypertension, thus providing clinicians with more specific pharmacologic tools for treating elderly hypertensives. In addition, these agents will avoid many of the side effects of other antihypertensive agents and can ameliorate certain concomitant diseases.\r"

However, a ratio of urinary calcium to creatinine exceeding 0.16 on a spot urine sample obtained in the fasted state suggests high bone turnover. Both single and dual photon absorptiometry are useful research tools but are unproved screening tests, especially in light of the more frequent use of preventive measures, such as postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, calcium supplementation, and weight-bearing exercise.\r"

Sixty-nine patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, 24 posthepatitis cirrhosis and 81 cryptogenic cirrhosis. At the time of inclusion, 75 patients (43%) had ascites and according to the Child-Pugh classification, 103 (59%) had Class A disease, 60 (34%) Class B and 11 (7%) Class C. We report here an interim analysis of the study when all patients had been followed for at least 1 year (mean follow-up = 22 months). At this time, the cumulative proportion of patients free of bleeding was 74% (both differences not significant), respectively. A retrospective analysis showed that the cumulative percentage of patients free of bleeding was significantly higher in the propranolol- than in the control-group in the subsets of patients without ascites or in Child-Pugh Class A: respectively, 87 vs. 64% (p = 0.023) and 88 vs. 64% (p = 0.01). No differences in bleeding incidence were found in patients with ascites or in Child-Pugh Class B or C. Propranolol treatment did not affect survival in any subgroup. Twenty-five patients had to be withdrawn from propranolol because of side effects (n = 23) or low compliance (n = 2). If confirmed on a longer follow-up, these results suggest that propranolol could prevent the first bleeding in patients with well-compensated cirrhosis.\r"

(ii) In the presence of all three hormones, it was possible to maintain the content of DNA, the activity of glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase at initial levels for 2 to 3 weeks. The activity of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase was affected by the concentration of insulin. (iii) The activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was stable for 3 days and declined to about 25% of the initial level after 2 weeks of culture, irrespective of the presence of hormones. (iv) Maintenance of albumin secretion was dependent on the presence of glucocorticoid, and glucocorticoid and insulin showed an additive or, at some time points, a synergistic effect on its secretion. (v) The content of cytochrome P-450 could be kept at 65% of the initial level, provided that a relatively high concentration of dexamethasone was present (10(-6) M). (vi) In the absence of hormones, urea synthesis was 70% of initial levels throughout the experimental period. With insulin and glucocorticoid present, a high concentration of glucagon (10(-8) M) was required to maintain the synthesis of urea at this level. (vii) It is concluded that hepatocyte cultures as described in the present study may be a useful, well-defined system for long-term metabolic, pharmacologic and toxicologic studies.\r"

The mechanisms of the pit cell accumulation were further studied by the metaphase arrest method and by selective irradiation of the liver, or of the rest of the body, with a dose of 8.5 Gy. Stimulated pit cells showed mitotic activity in the liver and to a lesser extent in peripheral blood. The zymosan-induced increase in pit cell number was inhibited by irradiation of the liver but not by irradiation of the rest of the body (with shielded liver). It is concluded that the hepatic pit cell population, which has been shown to have natural tumoricidal activity, can be induced to expand by biological response modifiers, and local division of preexisting cells contributes significantly to this expansion.\r"

Since the first bleeding episode can be lethal, we did a prospective, randomized trial to see whether beta-blockers could also prevent the first hemorrhage. Seventy-nine consecutive cirrhotics with large esophageal varices by endoscopy and who had never bled were randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: placebo; ranitidine (300 mg per day), or nadolol (40 to 120 mg per day)--which is not cardio-selective, reduces portal hypertension and does not interfere with renal flow. Since no significant differences between ranitidine and placebo treatment were observed, the two groups were combined as the control group and compared with the nadolol group. After a mean follow-up of 24 months, only 1 of the 30 patients in the nadolol group had bled, while 11 of the 49 patients in the control group had bled. The percentages of patients who had not bled 1 and 2 years after the inclusion were 100 and 94.4% for the nadolol group and 81.2 and 70.2% for the control group (p less than 0.02), respectively. There were no differences in the mortality rate. In conclusion, nadolol significantly protects against the first gastrointestinal bleeding episode in cirrhotics.\r"

Yeast containing a recombinant plasmid utilizing a constitutive promoter did not express this gene successfully due to the toxicity of the protein. A plasmid using a regulatable promoter directed expression which initiated late in the exponential phase of growth and resulted in the accumulation of high intracellular levels of the complete surface protein. The purified polypeptide aggregates into a form which, although not comprised of typical 20 nm particles, displays antigenic determinants encoded by the preS1, preS2 and S domains. Immunization of rabbits elicited the formation of antibodies directed against all three domains. This candidate vaccine will be useful for studying the contributions to viral immunity of the host response to the preS1 and preS2 domains.\r"

  ".W": "Localization of woodchuck hepatitis virus in liver tissue from 10 infected woodchucks was investigated immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally. Woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen was detected by immunoperoxidase methods in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes with a fine granular and/or inclusion body appearance. Woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen positive hepatocytes were often found in the peripheral zone of hepatic lobules. In contrast to human hepatitis B core antigen, woodchuck hepatitis virus core antigen was observed only in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, but not in the nuclei. In hyperplastic foci, woodchuck hepatitis virus antigen-positive hepatocytes were found in 3 of 8 animals. Furthermore, in 1 of 5 animals with hepatocellular carcinoma, woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen and woodchuck hepatitis virus core antigen were present in carcinoma cells. Electron microscopic examination revealed many filamentous structures (18 to 20 nm in diameter) in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. Noncoated core particles (18 to 20 nm in diameter) were found in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes, but not in the nuclei. The coated particles (42 to 45 nm in diameter) were observed in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. These coated particles were shown to be morphologically identical to the virus particles in serum. These results indicate that woodchuck hepatitis virus core antigen is produced and assembled mainly in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, and seems to be rapidly assembled into virion. The similarity of woodchuck hepatitis virus infection to human hepatitis B virus infection makes the woodchuck an excellent experimental model for the study of hepadna virus oncogenesis.\r"

After 6 weeks, both treatments significantly reduced supine and standing blood pressures; however, the magnitude of the decrease in supine systolic (-22.0 +/- 2.0 vs -12.1 +/- 3.4 mm Hg) and diastolic (-14.1 +/- 1.3 vs -7.6 +/- 2.1 mm Hg) pressures and in standing diastolic pressure (-16.0 +/- 1.7 vs -9.2 +/- 2.0 mm Hg) was more pronounced (p less than 0.05) in the N-treated than in the A-treated group. Pulse rate, plasma aldosterone, and plasma renin activity were lower (p less than 0.05) in the A-treated patients. Neither treatment had significant influence on [Na]i, [K]i, or ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux. The N-induced changes in supine systolic and diastolic pressure correlated (p less than 0.05) with age (r = -0.65 and r = -0.58, respectively) and pretreatment plasma renin activity (r = 0.71). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a negative association between pretrial [Na]i and the change in systolic pressure during N treatment that was independent of age, pretreatment blood pressure, and change in pulse rate. Age and the change in supine pulse rate were also independently correlated with the change in diastolic pressure during N treatment. The results show a greater antihypertensive efficacy of N than A in the patients entered in this study and suggest that a higher intracellular sodium concentration could predict a better hypotensive response to N.\r"

  ".W": "Enzymatic activity of tonin-alpha 1-macroglobulin complex was studied in vitro and in vivo, using an immunoimmobilization technique. Tonin-alpha 1-macroglobulin complex, which was immunologically immobilized by anti-alpha 1-macroglobulin antibody covalently coupled to agarose gels, could quantitatively hydrolyze angiotensin I and synthetic tridecapeptide renin substrate to form angiotensin II. However, the solid-phase antibody-bound tonin-alpha 1-macroglobulin complex could not hydrolyze the plasma protein renin substrate. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a serine protease inhibitor, inhibited both free tonin and the solid-phase antibody-bound tonin-alpha 1-macroglobulin complex. The hydrolytic activity of the solid-phase antibody-bound tonin-alpha 1-macroglobulin complex against angiotensin I was not inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (molecular weight, 23,000), a potent inhibitor of free tonin. Taken together, these results suggest that tonin bound to alpha 1-macroglobulin keeps the active site intact and that inhibition of the enzyme activity is due to a steric hindrance. When 500 microliter of tonin was administered intravenously to rats, the immunoimmobilization method was used to show that the tonin-alpha 1-macroglobulin complex in the plasma formed angiotensin II. Thus, the tonin-alpha 1-macroglobulin complex in the plasma may be linked to some forms of hypertension through angiotensin II formation.\r"
