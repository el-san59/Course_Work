  ".W": "To define risk factors for infant botulism, we performed a 2-year prospective case-control study of 68 laboratory-confirmed cases in infants living in the United States, outside of California. For each case patient, two control subjects were matched by date and hospital of birth or county birth records. By univariate analysis, breast-feeding (odds ratio = 2.9) and consumption of honey (odds ratio = 9.8) were associated with disease, but only 11 case patients (16%) had eaten honey. Decreased frequency of bowel movement (less than one per day for at least 2 months) was also associated with disease in infants 2 months of age and older (odds ratio = 5.2). Risk factors changed with the age of the patient at disease onset when analyzed by multivariate logistic regression methods. For infants less than 2 months old, living in a rural area or on a farm was the only significant risk factor (odds ratio = 6.4). For infants 2 months of age and older, breast-feeding (odds ratio = 3.8), less than one bowel movement per day for at least 2 months (odds ratio = 2.9), and ingestion of corn syrup (odds ratio = 5.2) were associated with disease. The severity of the disease was similar for breast- and bottle-fed infants. Clearly defined food exposures account for a minority of infant botulism cases. Preexisting host factors, such as intestinal flora and frequency of bowel movements, may be the most important risk factors for development of disease.\r"

It is inaccurate, however, when more than two types of hemoglobin are present. This article describes two infants with methemoglobinemia in whom pulse oximetry overestimated oxygen saturation. We discuss the mechanism of this systematic error and emphasize that pulse oximetry should not be used to estimate true oxygen saturation in the presence of methemoglobin. However, a disparity between oxygen saturation estimates by pulse oximetry and by calculations based on the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve can provide an important clue to the presence of such abnormal types of hemoglobins. Therapy should be based on direct measurements of oxyhemoglobin by cooximetry and not on measurements of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry or on saturations calculated from the Pao2 and the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.\r"

We evaluated whether alternating different loop diuretics could achieve the same initial diuretic response in the newborn. In a randomized double crossover study, we examined the diuretic and saliuretic effects of alternating doses of furosemide and ethacrynic acid (1 mg/kg administered intravenously every 24 hours) in 10 newborns, who received the drugs in the following sequential order: (1) furosemide, (2) ethacrynic acid, and (3) furosemide (group 1, n = 5); and (1) ethacrynic acid (2) furosemide, and (3) ethacrynic acid (group 2, n = 5). Hourly urine specimens were collected for the determination of rates of urinary and fractional excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium and of urinary flow, before and 6 hours after dosing. There were no differences between the groups at each dose for all parameters measured. A significant decrease in prediuretic and postdiuretic rates of urinary flow, in sodium and chloride excretion, and in the fractional excretion of these electrolytes was observed before and after dosing. The associated reduction in patients' weights suggested a depletion in plasma volume. In conclusion, consecutive alternation of furosemide and ethacrynic acid in the same newborn does not prevent the development of pharmacologic tolerance to loop diuretics, since diuresis, natriuresis, and chloriuresis decrease after successive sequential administration of these drugs.\r"

However, little is known about the actual prescription of psychotropic medications in pediatric settings. Using the 1985 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, we investigated the frequency of follow-up arrangements and concurrent psychotherapy among US children in visits to office-based practices. We then explored determinants of psychotropic drug prescriptions. Mental health indicators, sociodemographic characteristics, provider type, and provider familiarity with the patient were important predictors of psychotropic prescriptions. Few providers report referral or concurrent psychotherapy for their patients receiving psychotropics, and follow-up plans were no different for children with or without psychotropics after controlling for other variables. This means that many children in outpatient care who are taking psychotropic medications may not be receiving optimal management for behavioral or emotional problems.\r"

The BP cuff width was selected to be 40% to 50% of the circumference of the upper arm. Triplicate measurements of BP and heart rate were obtained in the waiting room of pediatricians' offices and well-baby clinics before the patients were examined by the physician or nurse. Three readings were possible in 87% of the infants less than 3 years of age and in all children 3 years of age and older. The average BP value (systolic/diastolic [mean]) increased rapidly from the 2- to 3-week value of 78/47 (59) mm Hg to the 1- to 5-month value of 95/60 (74) mm Hg. No subsequent increase in BP occurred until 2 years of age (96/56 [71] mm Hg) when systolic and mean pressures started to increase at an average annual rate of 2 mm Hg for systolic pressure and 1 mm Hg for mean pressure until reaching the 5-year value of 104/58 (75) mm Hg. Diastolic pressure did not increase from 1 month to 5 years of age. Heart rate decreased with increasing age from the 2- to 3-week value of 153 to the 5-year value of 97 beats per minute. There was no difference in BP and heart rate values between boys and girls or among ethnic groups over the age ranges studied. Considering the high success rate in obtaining BPs in infants and small children, it appears that BP should be determined routinely, regardless of the age of the patients, when an oscillometric device is available.\r"

The low serum IGF-1 and IGF-2 levels observed in nephrotic patients could be partially due to the increased urinary losses of the IGF carrier proteins.\r"

This determination protects the innocent passenger, when faced with criminal or civil charges, from being falsely prosecuted as the driver. The examination of the above-mentioned components in a multi-occupant collision takes on particular forensic importance when a surviving driver claims to be a passenger: the victim rather than the assailant.\r"

The mean duration of follow-up was 6 yr (range 0-17). One hundred and sixteen patients died, 84% as the result of liver disease and 16% from nonhepatic causes. Using the Kaplan-Meier estimate, we calculated the mortality from liver disease to be 40% after 5 yr and 60% after 10 yr. Ascites, serum bilirubin level, variceal hemorrhage, and age were identified as independent clinical risk factors, and extent of hepatic fibrosis, bilirubinostasis, and Mallory's hyalin were identified as independent histologic risk factors correlating with reduced survival.\r"

Propranolol caused an acute reduction in antipyrine clearance which did not persist with chronic administration. Propranolol did not influence the clearance of total or unconjugated paracetamol, either acutely or at 6 or 12 months. A slight increase in serum urea occurred in patients receiving propranolol, compared with the control group, but this difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that, although propranolol may have some influence on drug handling acutely, chronic administration does not interfere with hepatic drug metabolism or renal drug clearance.\r"

Postoperatively, mean total cholesterol levels fell by 26% at 1 month, and then rose steadily to 20% below preoperative levels of 20-24 months. The rise in cholesterol levels was due in part to an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol with a resultant improvement in the HDL:LDL ratio (LDL, low density lipoprotein). Five patients had refractory hypercholesterolemia and were treated with lovastatin. One of them was treated with a combination of lovastatin and LDL-apheresis. All patients experienced diarrhea which improved with time, but two patients required reversal of their bypass for intractable gas bloat syndrome. Each received lovastatin to control recrudescence of hypercholesterolamia following reversal. Ten patients are alive and well, but one patient died after a myocardial infarction 55 months postoperatively. The advent of lovastatin and other HMG COA reductase inhibitors is likely to decrease the use of partial ileal bypass to treat familial hypercholesterolemia.\r"

The disease affected the small bowel in 93 (35%) cases, the ileum and colon in 76 (28%), and the colon in 98 (37%). Forty-nine percent of the patients underwent major abdominal surgery for the disease at least once. The cumulative probability of abdominal surgery was 36% and 55%, 60 and 120 months after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Univariate analysis indicated that patients with colon involvement (p less than 0.0001), those with a longer interval between first symptom and diagnosis (p less than 0.0001), and those at an older age at diagnosis (p less than 0.0003) had a significantly greater probability of escaping abdominal surgery. The interval between first symptom and diagnosis, the site of disease, and the age at diagnosis were confirmed as risk factors for surgery, in decreasing order of importance, by multivariate analysis with Cox's proportional hazard model. A prognostic index for first operation based on these variables is proposed.\r"

Eight were diagnosed as having collagenous colitis on the basis of marked thickening of the subepithelial collagen layer in at least one set of biopsies. The thickness of the collagen table varied with time in all eight cases. When thickening was minimal, morphological features were indistinguishable from microscopic colitis, signifying that, in most cases, collagenous colitis and microscopic colitis are part of the same spectrum of colonic mucosal response. One of the eight patients had documented collagenous colitis and gluten-associated enteropathy for 12 yr. The colitis and duodenal histology improved synchronously when a gluten-free diet and corticosteroids were administered. The ninth patient had microscopic colitis and enteropathy which did not respond to gluten withdrawal. This patient never exhibited thickening of subepithelial collagen in repeated biopsies over 5 yr, suggesting that an entity of microscopic colitis may exist independent of collagenous colitis. Duodenal mucosal biopsies showed normal histology in four other patients with collagenous colitis. The histological variability of collagenization and inflammation during the course of collagenous colitis and microscopic colitis and the clinical feature of watery diarrhea suggest that these two entities be grouped together as the watery diarrhea-colitis syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 169 consecutive patients from low socioeconomic strata attending the gastroenterology clinic of Charity Hospital in New Orleans were evaluated clinically and endoscopically. This general New Orleans population is known to be at increased risk of developing gastric carcinoma. The type of gastritis was identified histologically, and the presence of Campylobacter pylori was determined by culture and/or histology. The overall prevalence of C. pylori infection in this patient population was 71% (126/169). These findings were correlated with serum IgG antibody to C. pylori using an ELISA. Fifteen patients with neither demonstrable gastritis nor C. pylori served as negative controls and had low levels of IgG antibody to C. pylori. A strong correlation was found between Campylobacter detection by morphologic and/or culture technique and the presence of serum IgG antibody. For all patients examined, the sensitivity of the ELISA was 94.2% and the specificity 75.5%. The highest ELISA values for IgG antibody (sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 75%) were detected in patients positive for C. pylori, who also had diffuse antral gastritis with prominent lymphoid follicles. For patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, the sensitivity of the ELISA was 96% and the specificity 67%. The latter number may indicate underrepresentation of foveolar epithelium in biopsies with extreme intestinal metaplasia. Results suggest a high prevalence of chronic infection of C. pylori in this clinic population. The possible role of C. pylori in the development of precursor lesions of gastric cancer is discussed.\r"

A fat meal has also been found to decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) in normal subjects. We used the ambulatory 24-h pH monitor to assess esophageal acid exposure in 10 normal subjects and 10 GER patients following low and high fat meals eaten in two body positions. The meals had nearly identical protein content, volumes, and calories. On successive days, patients ingested one of the meals twice, followed by random assignment to 3 h upright and 3 h recumbent position. Acid exposure for each hour over a 3-h postprandial (PP) period was assessed as the percent time pH less than 4.0. Increased upright acid exposure occurred in normals after the high fat (6.2 +/- 2.1%; mean +/- SE) compared with the low fat meal (1.5 +/- 0.5%; p less than 0.05). GER patients had greater (p less than 0.05) acid exposure than normals in all study periods, but no differences were found between low and high fat meals in either study position. High fat meals induce upright GER in normals, but do not significantly affect the abnormal amount of GER in patients. In addition, progressive increases in acid exposure were found over the 3 postprandial hours in GER patients in a recumbent position. The findings are consistent with prior data showing decreased LESP with a fat meal in normals.\r"

The surgical specimen showed dilatation of the cecum and ascending colon with a solitary mucosal ulcer in the latter. The major histologic changes were limited to the area of ulceration. In addition to classical CMV inclusions. vasculitis manifested in two forms, namely, leukocytoclastic type and fibrinoid necrosis. The patient died shortly thereafter, due to multi-organ system failure. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported case of toxic megacolon due to CMV infection without underlying inflammatory bowel disease. The pathogenesis of toxic colonic dilatation remains unknown.\r"

Thin limbs were examined in the isolated perfused kidney under a variety of conditions that alter oxygenation and active transport in the medulla and are known to affect injury to the medullary thick ascending limb. The thin descending limbs of short loops were preserved in all experimental groups, but those of the long loop showed necrosis that was restricted to the proximal portion, where the epithelium is more complex. In oxygenated kidneys, necrosis involved 41% +/- 5% (mean +/- SE) of the medullary thick ascending limbs and 10% +/- 3% of the proximal portion of long loops of thin descending limbs. Under hypoxic conditions, necrosis involved 90% +/- 3% of the medullary thick ascending limbs and 70% +/- 5% of the proximal portion of long loops of thin descending limbs (P less than 0.0001 compared with oxygenated kidneys). Ouabain and absence of filtration completely prevented necrosis of both nephron segments. Thus, the proximal portions of long loops of thin descending limbs, in resemblance to medullary thick ascending limbs, are especially susceptible to transport-dependent hypoxic injury.\r"

Of these 79 patients, hematuria was the presenting symptom in 90%, with coincident loin pain in 49%. Urine microscopy of asymptomatic first-degree relatives revealed hematuria in 44% of children and siblings and 54% of parents, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Arteriolar C3 deposition was confirmed by biopsy in four asymptomatic relatives with hematuria. Generalized thinning of glomerular basement membrane (less than 200 nm) was observed in five patients and focal thinning was observed in six patients with coincident afferent arteriolar C3 deposition. Seven other patients were identified as having generalized thinning of glomerular basement membrane in the absence of afferent arteriolar C3 deposition. Renal function was stable and similar in all groups studied over 37.9 +/- 23.7 months. No difference in clinical presentation or urinary abnormalities was evident between the groups. No arteriolar C3 deposition was evident in eight autopsy specimens with no known renal disease. It was concluded that afferent arteriolar C3 deposition is a marker of a distinct hereditary pathological entity, with differentiation from thin basement membrane disease not possible on clinical grounds. The medium- and long-term prognoses with respect to renal function are excellent.\r"

The proportion of gram-positive and gram-negative infections was constant across episodes. In patients with multiple infections, negative organisms were found to have increased risk of recurring as gram-negative infection. A similar observation was made for fungal infections. Of patients with multiple peritonitis episodes, more than 40% of those who transferred to other maintenance renal replacement therapy identified peritonitis as the reason for transfer. A discrete time logistic model was used to estimate peritonitis risk in 4-month follow-up periods. Patients like those on the registry are estimated to have a 22% risk of developing peritonitis during any 4-month period. This risk was increased 4% for patients aged less than 21 years, 7% for nonwhite patients, and 19% in the period following a peritoneal infection.\r"

The crystalline inclusions were most prominent in the visceral epithelium but were also noted in endothelial and mesangial cells, in the parietal epithelium, and in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules. On electron microscopy the crystalline structures were of various geometric shapes but had no definite substructure. Immunofluorescence was negative. The patient was considered to have a hitherto undescribed metabolic disease. Several months later the patient underwent an operation for carpal tunnel syndrome and amyloid deposits, crystalline inclusions similar to those noted in the kidney were observed in the synovial tissue. Shortly after this the patient was found to have multiple myeloma of IgG, kappa type with Bence Jones proteinuria. Lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow contained the same crystalline inclusions noted in the kidney and synovium. This case therefore seems to represent a new and very rare form of glomerular involvement in multiple myeloma.\r"

One inhibitor patient showed a partial deletion of about 9 kb that removes exons a-c. A partial deletion of at least 11 kb that removed exon a and that had a maximum size of 35 kb in the 5'-flanking region could be identified in a patient of unknown status. In another three noninhibitor patients a complete deletion of the factor IX gene and two partial deletions could be observed. The partial deletions are of approximately 8 kb and approximately 1.5 kb, removing exons d and e and exon g, respectively. As detected by oligonucleotide probing, a C-to-T transition at amino acid 338 gave rise to an altered TaqI restriction pattern that could be observed in a sixth patient. The other 64 hemophilia B patients, including two inhibitor patients, showed a hybridization pattern indistinguishable from a normal one.\r"

The tumor-associated 11;22 rearrangement of Ewing sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (NE) is cytologically very similar to the 11;22 constitutional rearrangement. Using immunoglobulin light-chain constant region, ETS1 probes, and the technique of in situ hybridization, we previously were able to show that the constitutional and ES/NE breakpoints are different. As a first step toward isolating these translocation junctions and to further distinguish between them, we have made somatic cell hybrids. Cells from a constitutional 46,XX,inv(9),t(11;22) carrier and from an ES cell line with a t(11;22) were separately fused to a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient Chinese hamster cell line (RJK88). Resulting clones were screened with G-banding and Southern hybridization. Hybrid clones derived from the constitutional t(11;22) were established which contained the der(22) and both the der(22) and the der(11). Hybrid clones derived from the ES cell line containing the der(11) were isolated. Using the technique of Southern hybridization we have sublocalized the loci; ApoA1/C3, CD3D, ETS1, PBGD, THY1, D11S29, D11S34, and D11S147 to the region between the two breakpoints on chromosome 11 and V lambda I, V lambda VI, V lambda VII, and D22S10 to the region between the breakpoints on chromosome 22. Using anonymous DNA probes, we found that D22S9 and D22S24 map proximal to the constitutional breakpoint and that D22S15 and D22S32 map distal to the ES breakpoint on chromosome 22.\r"

Hypopigmentation in PLWS individuals appears to be as common as previously recognized features such as behavioral problems and dental abnormalities. Significant differences in hair color, sun sensitivity, and complexion were found between those PLWS patients with the chromosome 15 deletion and those with normal chromosomes. Individuals with the deletion frequently had lighter hair color, more sun sensitivity, and fairer complexion than did either other family members or nondeletion PLWS patients. No significant differences in biochemical findings (phenylalanine, tyrosine, catecholamines, or beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) were found between deletion and nondeletion PLWS patients or between hypopigmented and normally pigmented patients.

Its precise role in lipid metabolism is not well established, though it may be involved in cholesterol esterification and cholester ester transport to the liver for catabolism. No genetic polymorphism has been reported in the APO D gene product. To investigate the extent of genetic variation at the APO D structural locus, we have developed an isoelectric focusing-immunoblotting technique and have screened a large number of plasma samples from U.S. whites, U.S. blacks, Nigerian blacks, the Aleuts of the Pribilof Islands, Eskimo groups from Kodiak Island and St. Lawrence Island, and Amerindian populations from Mexico and Canada. Except for the U.S. blacks and Nigerian blacks, the APO D locus is monomorphic in all other population groups tested. In populations with black ancestry, the products of two alleles, APO D*1 and APO D*2, have been observed at respective allele frequencies .987 and .013 in U.S. blacks and .978 and .022 in Nigerian blacks. The detection of a unique protein polymorphism in blacks makes APO D a useful black marker of significance in anthropogenetics and racial admixture studies. In addition to the interindividual variation observed, APO D reveals extensive intraindividual molecular variation with a multiple banding pattern. The basis of this molecular variation is explained, in part, by variation in the number of terminal sialic acid residues. We have investigated the effect of the APO D polymorphism on triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-, VLDL-, HDL-, and HDL3 cholesterol in 352 Nigerian blacks (190 males and 162 females).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sequential analysis of trios of loci by sperm typing will provide a very accurate means of ordering any number of tightly linked loci. Here, we describe experimental design and sample-size issues raised by the application of sperm typing by PCR for mapping human chromosomes, and we demonstrate that sperm typing will be an efficient method for generating fine-structure human genetic maps.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized further the molecular basis of human inherited propionyl CoA carboxylase deficiency by measuring steady state levels of the mRNAs coding for the enzyme's two protein subunits (alpha and beta) and by estimating initial synthesis and steady state levels of the protein subunits in skin fibroblasts from controls and affected patients. We studied cell lines from both major complementation groups (pccA and pccBC) corresponding, respectively, to defects in the carboxylase's alpha and beta subunits. Analysis of pccA lines revealed the absence of alpha chain mRNA in three and an abnormally small alpha-mRNA in a fourth. Despite the presence of normal beta-mRNA in each of these pccA lines, there was complete absence of both alpha and beta protein subunits under steady state conditions, even though new synthesis and mitochondrial import of beta precursors was normal. Results in nine pccBC lines revealed normal alpha mRNA in each, while the amounts of beta-mRNA were distinctly reduced in every case. Correspondingly, alpha protein subunits were present in normal amounts at steady-state, but beta subunits were uniformly decreased. In addition, in six of the nine beta deficient cell lines, partially degraded beta-subunits were observed. To help interpret these results, synthesis and stability of carboxylase subunits were studied in intact HeLa cells using a pulse-chase protocol. Whereas alpha chains were stable over the four hour interval studied, beta chains--initially synthesized in large excess over alpha chains--were degraded rapidly reaching equivalence with alpha chains after two hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As for all other populations reported, an association of HLA-A3 and HLA-B7 with the disease was found. A weak association with HLA-B12 was also detected. No other significant positive or negative associations with HLA alleles were detected. In addition, HLA-A2 and -B12 were in significant linkage disequilibrium in patients but not in controls, which may indicate a new mutation or recent recombination between HLA-A and hemochromatosis either in our patient group or in the founding population. HLA-A1 and -B8 and HLA-A29 and -B12 were in linkage disequilibrium in controls but not in patients, suggesting that this population is not segregating a hemochromatosis allele on either of these haplotypes. Genetic linkage analysis using the program LIPED showed strong linkage in 23/24 families, most of which had additional HLA alleles (other than A3 and B7) associated with hemochromatosis. This provides evidence for a single hemochromatosis locus, possibly with more than one allele.\r"

In 1,364 adults in 26 residential units, seven presumably neutral isoenzyme systems were typed; ACP1 ESD, GLO I, GPT, PGD, PGM1 and PGP. It was found that average kinship for these neutral systems is correlated with geographic distance in this small area, but not as strongly as kinship for beta-thalassemia. A north-south gradient was observed for ESD. Analysis of correspondences indicated GPT, PGM1, and GLO I as the systems contributing most to differentiation within the province.

To better define the underlying cause of these disorders, we have analyzed the collagens from costal cartilage from several of these patients, using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of intact chains and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptides and amino acid analysis. In almost all of the patients in this study group, the type II collagen exhibited a slower electrophoretic mobility when compared with that in normal controls. The mobility of many, but not all, of the CNBr peptides was also retarded. Peptides near the amino terminus were almost always altered, while the mobility of peptides close to the carboxyl terminus were normal in all but the severely affected cases. Analysis of the CNBr peptides on an HPLC sieving column confirmed that the electrophoretically abnormal peptides were of a higher molecular weight than were control peptides. Amino acid analysis indicated that the abnormal collagens have a higher ratio of hydroxylysine to lysine than does control collagen, suggesting that overmodification may be involved in the altered mobility. Our results are consistent with a defect in the collagen helix that results in overmodification of the molecule from that point toward the amino terminus. We propose that some forms of SED and SEMD are associated with abnormalities in type II collagen that results in delayed helix formation and consequent overmodification of the collagen. Cases of SED fit onto a continuous spectrum of clinical severity that correlates positively with both the extent of alteration and the proximity of the defect to the carboxyl terminus.\r"

A high frequency (41%) of reduction to homozygosity was detected with the probe p1-79, which recognizes the highly polymorphic locus D1Z2, localized on 1p36. Loss of heterozygosity at other chromosome 1 loci was much less common, not exceeding a frequency of 10%, and was never observed in the absence of the D1Z2 loss. Somatic loss of heterozygosity at D1Z2 was more frequent in patients with a strong family history of breast cancer (60%), in patients with early diagnosis (before 45 years of age) (70%), and in those with multiple tumors or tumor foci (50%) than in patients with none of the characteristics of hereditary tumors (21%). No associations were observed between loss of heterozygosity and prognostic factors. These results suggest that inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene located on the distal portion of chromosome 1p, alone or combined with other genetic changes, may represent a fundamental step in the pathogenesis of ductal carcinoma of the breast.\r"

In most cases, models of Mendelian transmission could not be rejected; however, several samples approached significance levels. When Mendelian transmission was assumed, reasonably good parameter estimates were obtained, although heterozygote penetrances were often overestimated. Different sampling schemes were imposed on the simulated data in order to examine the extent of information loss with the reduction in sample size. One of these strategies (a sequential sampling scheme) appears to have resulted in critical loss of information in some cases.\r"

Our results suggest that detecting linkage at larger recombination frequencies may require larger data sets or large high-density families. When applied to all families without regard to informativeness of the family structure for linkage, analyses of simulated data could detect no advantage of simultaneous estimation over more traditional and much less time-consuming methods, either in detecting linkage, estimating frequency, refining estimates of parameters for the qualitative trait locus, or avoiding false evidence for linkage.

  ".W": "PURPOSE: In 24 patients with stable spontaneous and effort-related angina, ischemic episodes at rest were not preceded by changes in circulatory variables (heart rate, systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures) that may raise the myocardial oxygen consumption. We interpreted these episodes as caused by critical and reversible coronary flow reduction at the site of a stenotic lesion, and evaluated the clinical efficacy of nifedipine and propranolol in the treatment of this condition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was randomized, placebo-controlled, and crossover in design. Nineteen of the 24 subjects were men (mean group age, 59 years; range, 47 to 65 years). The study consisted of four four-day periods. The first and the fourth periods, during which patients received placebo, were single-blind. The treatment consisted of 80 mg of propranolol or 20 mg of nifedipine administered four times daily. The second and the third periods, during which patients received propranolol or nifedipine crossing over to the alternative drug in the next period, were double-blind and separated by a 24-hour interval. RESULTS: Propranolol fully abolished or reduced the number of spontaneous ischemic episodes in a significantly larger proportion of patients than did nifedipine; it was also effective in several cases in which nifedipine had failed or had even caused a paradoxic effect. Quantitative angiographic evaluation of the influences of nifedipine (Group 1, 12 patients, 10 mg sublingually) and propranolol (Group 2, 12 patients, 0.1 mg/kg intravenously) on the residual lumen diameter of one significant coronary stenosis in each patient showed that (1) after nifedipine, the lumen was unchanged in one, augmented in seven, and reduced in four cases; (2) variations ranged between +1.59 and -1.2 mm, and their direction correlated closely with the influence of oral nifedipine on the episodes of spontaneous ischemia; and (3) in no case did treatment with propranolol vary the stenosis lumen by more than 0.3 mm. CONCLUSION: In this form of angina, a number of lesions seem to offer a compliant substrate for vasomotion and, possibly, for critical changes in flow. The vasomotor influences of nifedipine on these lesions are variable as well as the efficacy of the drug on the manifestations of ischemia at rest. Propranolol produces no important variations of the coronary stenotic lesions, causes a decrease of heart rate that facilitates coronary flow in diastole, and reduces the baseline metabolic demand of the heart so that the threshold of ischemia during critical reduction of coronary flow may become elevated.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: To analyze left ventricular function and contractility in patients with essential hypertension after reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy, 14 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were studied prospectively by echocardiogram (1) before, (2) during, and (3) after left ventricular mass had been reduced by antihypertensive therapy of 19 +/- 3 months' duration. All drugs were discontinued four weeks before the first and the third study. RESULTS: At the time of the third study, arterial pressure had returned to pretreatment values, and mean, peak, and isovolumetric (but not end-systolic) wall stress increased, whereas left ventricular mass remained diminished. Despite the increased pressure load to the heart, myocardial contractility was maintained or improved after reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy, as indicated by the ratio of end-systolic wall stress to end-systolic volume index (p less than 0.02) and by the relation of fractional shortening to end-systolic wall stress (p less than 0.06). End-diastolic volume, an indicator of preload, remained reduced after therapy (p less than 0.05). As a result, pump function of the left ventricle improved as shown by an increase in the ejection fraction (p less than 0.05), fractional fiber shortening (p less than 0.05), and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (p less than 0.01). CONCLUSION: Thus, in patients with essential hypertension, reduction of myocardial hypertrophy by antihypertensive therapy appears to be beneficial rather than detrimental to cardiac pump performance.\r"

We prospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcome of 140 consecutive hospitalized patients who had cardiopulmonary arrest and received CPR, and we propose a method for predicting survival in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study period was July 1 through December 31, 1985, and the patient population consisted of 91 men and 49 women (age range, 18 to 92 years). We devised a multifactorial scoring system, the Pre-Arrest Morbidity (PAM) Index, to evaluate pre-arrest morbidity in individual patients. RESULTS: Seventy-seven (55%) of these patients were successfully resuscitated, 34 (24.3%) were discharged from the hospital alive, and 29 (20.7%) were long-term survivors (alive three months after discharge). Multivariate analysis of pre-arrest clinical variables demonstrated a significant association with mortality for hypotension, azotemia, and age 65 years or older, although none of these factors was absolutely predictive of a fatal outcome. The PAM Index was found to correlate inversely with the frequency of successful resuscitation, and the probability of short-term and long-term survival after CPR. Patients with PAM scores of 7 or greater had an extremely low likelihood of long-term survival (less than 15%), and no patient with a score of more than 8 survived to discharge. When the PAM score was considered in multivariate analysis of pre-arrest variables, it became the only significant independent predictor of mortality. CONCLUSION: The PAM Index may be useful in identifying patients in whom CPR may be ineffective.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The ability of stored intracellular iron to enhance magnetic susceptibility forms the basis by which tissue iron can be detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. We used this technique to assess myocardial, spleen, and liver iron content in patients with known or suspected iron overload disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spin echo NMR images were obtained in 30 patients; 20 had chronic anemias treated by multiple blood transfusions, five had idiopathic hemochromatosis, and five had non-hemochromatotic liver disease with elevated serum ferritin levels and no stainable iron on liver biopsy. The acquisition of oblique images through the short axis of the left ventricle permitted assessment of left ventricular function, while demonstrating the liver and spleen on the same image. Iron content was assessed using a signal intensity ratio of organ (spleen, liver, or myocardium) to skeletal muscle. RESULTS: In patients with multiple blood transfusions, iron content was highest in liver, followed by the spleen. Significant iron overload was detected in the myocardium of only one patient. Left ventricular systolic wall thickening was normal in patients receiving multiple blood transfusions. Two patients with treated idiopathic hemochromatosis had normal signal intensity ratios, and three untreated patients had evidence of significant deposits of iron in the liver and spleen as indicated by a reduction in signal intensity ratios (0.2 +/- 0.01 and 0.9 +/- 0.01, respectively). Five patients with non-hemochromatotic liver disease and high serum ferritin levels had normal signal intensity ratios by NMR imaging. CONCLUSION: NMR imaging is a useful method of detecting tissue iron and distinguishing disease due to iron overload. Myocardial iron deposition is a late event, occurring after accumulation of iron in the spleen and liver.\r"

  ".U": "89300843\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: The association between sickle cell trait (SCT) and complications related to exercise may be explained if exercise-induced sickling interferes with capillary blood flow and causes tissue ischemia and functional abnormalities. To test this hypothesis, we measured sickling and blood gas values in venous and arterial blood of an exercising limb in subjects with SCT and in controls. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 15 subjects with hemoglobin AS (SCT group) and 15 subjects with hemoglobin AA (control group). Each performed two maximal arm crank exercise tests, one at 1,270 meters and one at simulated 4,000 meters. RESULTS: At 1,270 meters, axillary venous sickling increased significantly (p less than 0.05) from (mean +/- SD) 1.0 +/- 1.0% at rest to 2.3 +/- 2.6% during peak exercise. At simulated 4,000 meters, sickling increased significantly (p less than 0.001) from 1.5 +/- 1.2% to 8.5 +/- 7.1%. A wide range of sickling during peak exercise was observed (1% to 25%). One minute after exercise at simulated 4,000 meters, venous sickling remained elevated (7.2 +/- 7.8%) despite high levels of oxygen saturation. Arterial sickling (less than 1%) was present in only two subjects. There was no significant difference in oxygen consumption (29.4 +/- 3 versus 30.7 +/- 4 mL/kg/minute) between the subjects with SCT and the controls, nor was there a correlation between exercise performance and sickling (r less than 0.2). CONCLUSION: We conclude that exercise at 1,270 meters slightly, albeit significantly, increased sickling in blood from an exercising limb and that simulated 4,000 meters dramatically potentiated this effect. Sickling in the effluent blood of an exercising limb does not appear to measurably affect overall maximal arm crank exercise performance.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Kaposi's sarcoma occurs commonly in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Kaposi's sarcoma may remain localized or disseminate to involve visceral organs such as the lungs. Disseminated pulmonary involvement, when it occurs, is often fatal. Effective therapy may improve survival in such patients. We herein report on 20 patients with disseminated pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty previously untreated patients with pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma were identified. All were treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy consisting of either Adriamycin alone, a combination of Adriamycin, bleomycin, and vincristine (ABV), or bleomycin and vincristine (BV). The response to therapy and factors affecting prognosis were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Twelve (60%) patients showed a favorable response to therapy. The median survival from the initiation of chemotherapy for the 12 responders was 10 months (range: three to 31 + months) versus six months (range: one to 17+ months) for the non-responders. Eleven of the patients showing a response received ABV or BV combination chemotherapy (p = 0.004). Survival was shortened by the presence of either pleural effusion (p = 0.002), T4 lymphopenia of less than 100/mm3 (p = 0.03), or both at study entry. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, combination chemotherapy consisting of ABV or BV is associated with dramatic clinical and functional improvement. The median survival of 10 months demonstrates the value of combination chemotherapy in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The use of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in cardiopulmonary arrest has been questioned, but the effects of NaHCO3 in patients with heart disease are not known. We therefore prospectively evaluated the effects of NaHCO3 in patients with congestive heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients received NaHCO3 and control infusions of equimolar sodium chloride (NaCl). Measurements were made of blood gases, 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-DPG), glucose, lactate, cardiac hemodynamics, and oxygen consumption. RESULTS: The arterial oxygen tension (pO2) fell an average of 10 mm Hg after NaHCO3 administration in patients with congestive heart failure, whereas it rose with NaCl (p less than 0.005). Myocardial oxygen consumption decreased by 17% (p less than 0.002) without an accompanying change in oxygen demand. Systemic oxygen consumption fell by 21%. Red blood cell 2,3-DPG levels were elevated at baseline, but did not change with NaHCO3 administration. The oxygen pressure at 50% hemoglobin saturation (P50) was correspondingly elevated at baseline in these patients and decreased significantly with NaHCO3 (Bohr effect) (p less than 0.003). The arterial and mixed venous carbon dioxide tensions increased with NaHCO3 but decreased with NaCl administration (p less than 0.05). Blood glucose concentrations fell by 1.7 mmol/L with NaHCO3 (p less than 0.003) and blood lactate concentrations increased uniformly (p less than 0.001). Three patients developed net myocardial lactate generation during NaHCO3 administration; two of these three developed symptoms of angina. Coronary blood flow did not change with NaHCO3 but increased with NaCl (p less than 0.04). Two patients developed transient pump failure. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that NaHCO3 impairs arterial oxygenation and reduces systemic and myocardial oxygen consumption. The decrease in oxygen utilization is associated with anaerobic metabolism, enhanced glycolysis, and elevation of the blood lactate level, and may lead to transient myocardial ischemia in some patients. Thus, the use of NaHCO3 in such patients warrants re-evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Contradictory results have been obtained with regards to the effect of various treatment modes on the exacerbation of Graves' ophthalmopathy, probably because the number of patients in each study was small and some studies were analyzed only in relation to one type of treatment. To circument these problems, we studied the course of Graves' ophthalmopathy after various modes of therapy for thyrotoxicosis among 537 patients with Graves' disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 537 patients with Graves' disease were prospectively studied over an 11-year period. Thirty-one patients were lost to follow-up during the first six months after treatment and were excluded from the study. Of those remaining, 426 received one form of treatment, 79 received two kinds of therapy, and one received three kinds of therapy. Thus, surgical treatments numbered 164, radioactive iodine-131 (131I) treatments numbered 241, and medical treatments numbered 182. Ocular signs were considered improved or exacerbated by the following criteria: decrement or increment of the exophthalmos of 2 mm or more, improvement or deterioration of visual acuity, and regression or progression of extraocular muscle involvement causing diplopia. RESULTS: Among patients who did not have infiltrative ophthalmopathy before treatment, there was no difference in the occurrence of posttreatment exophthalmos in the surgically, medically, and 131I-treated patients (7.1%, 6.7%, and 4.9%, respectively). The incidence and the degree of progression of ophthalmopathy in patients who already had exophthalmos before treatment were similar in the medically, surgically, and 131I-treated groups (19.2%, 19.8%, and 22.7%, respectively). Most of the progression occurred in the posttreatment euthyroid stage. The incidence of improvement of ophthalmopathy was also similar (14.1%, 12.6%, and 12.3% in the medically, surgically, and 131I-treated patients). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found no influence of type of therapy for thyrotoxicosis on the clinical course of Graves' ophthalmopathy in this retrospective study of 537 patients.\r"

  ".U": "89300849\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Although immunologic mechanisms have been postulated in the pathogenesis of vasculitis, an autoimmune process directed against specific autologous vascular wall antigens has not been previously documented. We examined the role of an immunologic response to vascular endothelial cell (VEC) antigens in patients with vasculitis, because of the observed immunogenicity of VECs in renal and cardiac allograft recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study patients included 21 with systemic vasculitis and four with hypersensitivity vasculitis. A healthy, normal control group consisted of 51 young subjects and 61 older subjects. Thirty-two patients with connective tissue diseases were also evaluated. The presence of autoantibody to autologous monocytes and other cell types was determined with previously described standard crossmatch techniques. Patient sera exhibiting autoantibody to autologous monocytes were screened against a panel of allogeneic cells. The cell panel consisted of concordant T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and VECs from 16 umbilical cord donors. Sera from four patients were analyzed for specificity to the vascular endothelium of frozen sections of vessels. RESULTS: An autoantibody to VEC antigens was detected in 18 of the 21 patients (86%) with confirmed systemic vasculitis, not of the hypersensitivity type. This autoantibody was highly cytotoxic, complement-fixing, and specific for antigens on the surface of the VEC. Findings on allogeneic VEC panel analysis support the existence of multiple allotypes in the VEC antigen system. In three patients, fluctuations in the titer of the autoantibody generally correlated with clinical symptoms. In the four patients screened for the specificity of the autoantibody to anatomically different cadaveric blood vessels, specific anatomic patterns of reactivity were observed. Autoantibody to VEC antigens was not found in young controls and was documented in low frequency in older controls and in patients with connective tissue diseases. The autoantibody was seen in one of four patients (25%) with hypersensitivity vasculitis. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that an autoantibody to VEC antigens may be involved in the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitis or may be a diagnostic marker for the disease process.\r"

  ".U": "89300850\r", 
  ".W": "The claim that a treatment is futile is often used to justify a shift in the physician's ethical obligations to patients. In clinical situations in which non-futile treatments are available, the physician has an obligation to discuss therapeutic alternatives with the patient. By contrast, a physician is under no obligation to offer, or even to discuss, futile therapies. This shift is supported by moral reasoning in ancient and modern medical ethics, by public policy, and by case law. Given this shift in ethical obligations, one might expect that physicians would have unambiguous criteria for determining when a therapy is futile. This is not the case. Rather than being a discrete and definable entity, futile therapy is merely the end of the spectrum of therapies with very low efficacy. Ambiguity in determining futility, arising from linguistic errors, from statistical misinterpretations, and from disagreements about the goals of therapy, undermines the force of futility claims. Decisions to withhold therapy that is deemed futile, like all treatment choices, must follow both clinical judgments about the chance of success of a therapy and an explicit consideration of the patient's goals for therapy. Futility claims rarely should be used to justify a radical shift in ethical obligations.\r"

  ".W": "Because only 2% of the 47% of cancer patients with psychiatric disorders receive psychiatric consultations, the authors investigated the impact of a psychiatric liaison program on improving consultation rates on a gynecologic oncology unit. Consultation rates for gynecologic cancer patients before and after introduction of the program were compared to rates from other cancer patients in the same hospital during the same 7-year period. Rates for the gynecologic patients were higher after the program (9%) than before (4%), as were rates for follow-up consultations, and the detection of minor DSM-III disorders improved. The authors conclude that liaison improves access to psychiatric treatments that often enhance the quality of life for seriously ill patients.\r"

This locus exerts the major controlling effect on susceptibility to Plasmodium cynomolgi B. The other genetic component is independent of esterase and exerts major control over refractoriness to the P. cynomolgi Ceylon strain parasite. Genetic assortment of the esterase-independent component suggests that it is controlled by 1 principal locus, here named Pif-C.

Genetic studies demonstrate a significant association between the refractory response to Plasmodium cynomolgi B strain and the Est A allele at an autosomal esterase locus. Increased susceptibility to parasites is associated with an alternate Est C allele. Lines selected to be homozygous for the Est A and Est C alleles show enhanced levels of refractoriness and susceptibility when compared to the unselected parental stock. Expression of the refractory phenotype is reduced much more than the susceptible phenotype at high parasite density, suggesting that refractoriness may be due to a positive effector.\r"

None of the murine Mabs induced by infection or by immunization with a crude cercarial antigen (CCA) served this purpose. Two Mabs out of 9 (KCSme22-3 and KCSme22-4) induced by soluble egg antigens reacted with CCA but not with normal snail (NSN) extract. We selected these 2 for studies on detection and characterization of schistosomal antigens in snails. When employed in an ELISA, they differentially detected schistosomal antigens in extracts and cell-free hemolymph (plasma) of infected snails. The selected Mabs bind to cercarial surface as demonstrated by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) with paraformaldehyde-fixed cercariae. The epitopes corresponding to the selected Mabs are periodate sensitive, suggesting the glycoprotein nature of the antigens recognized. Immunoblotting analysis employing the selected Mab revealed 1 antigen in CCA (Mr = 205 kDa) and 3 antigens in snail plasma (Mr = 220 kDa, 180 kDa, and 135 kDa). Schistosomal antigens were first detectable in the snails' plasma 2 weeks after snail infection, and their quantity increased afterwards.\r"

Despite the greater sensitivity of isoenzyme electrophoresis, DNA analysis did detect previously unsuspected variations between isolates in 1 zymodeme. Eighteen different genetic groups were detected among the 49 isolates by isoenzyme and DNA analyses. Genetic differences between groups, calculated from DNA restriction fragment variation, were significantly correlated with differences calculated from allozyme variation. This correlation between the 2 techniques suggests that G. duodenalis consists of a complex of genetically diverse clones. Such a genetic structure has important implications for the taxonomy of Giardia and the epidemiology of giardiasis.\r"

  ".W": "We reacted 490 hexapeptides homologous to the amino acid sequence of the dengue 2 (DEN-2) virus envelope glycoprotein with antisera from 7 patients with primary DEN-2 virus infections to identify the continuous epitopes recognized by human IgG. There were 124 peptides in 25 clusters (domains) that bound 2 or more antisera. Twenty-two peptides in 7 domains bound all 7 convalescent DEN-2 virus antisera tested, and thus appeared to represent immunodominant epitopes. The evidence that these domains represents continuous epitopes of the envelope glycoprotein is that peptide representing each domain bound multiple sera, peptide reactivity was highly ordered along the amino acid sequence, and in almost all cases, domains were regions of predicted hydrophilicity. Heterologous flavivirus antisera also exhibited binding to the majority of peptides reactive with anti-DEN-2 virus sera, though 4 candidate DEN-2 specific epitopes were identified along with an immunodominant epitope common to dengue, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile viruses. Synthetic peptides representing these epitopes may prove to be useful for a variety of purposes.\r"

Five patients died from the recurrent cancer. The other causes of death were metachronous primary cancer in eight patients, synchronous primary cancer of sigmoid colon or rectum in two, cerebrovascular accident in six, heart disease in six, other causes in four, and unknown causes in four. Although the prognosis of early gastric cancer is remarkably good, patients should be carefully followed over a long period for late recurrence of the primary cancer and possible metachronous cancer of the other organs.\r"

Although there was no apparent relationship between the interval between colostomy creation and closure, three of the six major complications occurred in patients whose colostomies were closed soon after complicated initial injuries. It is recommended that if the primary operation is complicated by intraabdominal sepsis or major wound problems, 6 months should ensue before attempting closure. Long term follow-up of these patients (mean 39 months) disclosed a low incidence of late complications secondary to colostomy closure. Although the trend toward the increased use of primary repair of colon injuries in selected patients is supported, our study indicates that the risk of colostomy closure has been exaggerated and should not be a factor in the decision to create a colostomy after colon trauma.\r"

A significant increase in peritoneal fluid ammonia was also demonstrated, but this did not occur until more than 16 hours after strangulation. In a second group of two dogs in which simple obstruction was produced, no significant increase in peritoneal fluid lactic acid or ammonia occurred. We did not find significant changes in peritoneal fluid amylase in this study.

Acute pancreatitis was induced in 21 dogs by injecting 0.5 ml/kg of autologous bile into the pancreatic duct. In 10 dogs, resuscitation was begun with a 4 ml/kg bolus of hypertonic saline-dextran solution; 11 dogs received no bolus. Lactated Ringer's solution was infused in all dogs to maintain mean arterial pressure and cardiac output at baseline values. Pulmonary hypertension accompanied by a significant increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and a decrease in lung blood flow occurred in those dogs resuscitated with lactated Ringer's solution alone. By contrast, dogs in the hypertonic saline-dextran group maintained pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance at baseline values while nutritive blood flow to the lung decreased progressively. Our data suggest that hypertonic saline-dextran resuscitation effectively restores cardiac function while it significantly reduces fluid requirements, as well as the pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary edema that frequently accompany lactated Ringer's resuscitation of acute pancreatitis.\r"

The model was produced by inoculation of VX2 cells into the wall of the hepatic hilar bile duct. Histologic examination revealed that the mode of spreading of VX2 cells in the model closely resembles that of human bile duct cancer. On the other hand, selective accumulation of MMC-AC into the lymphatic vessels around the intrahepatic bile duct was observed after its injection into the hepatic hilum in rabbits. To assess the anticancer effect, 1 ml of MMC-AC was injected into the bile duct wall near the VX2 tumor. The numbers of lymphatic vessels where necrosis of VX2 cells was observed in one-third or more were 34 of 103 vessels 0.5 cm away from the tumor, 23 of 80 vessels 1.5 cm away, and 9 of 67 vessels 2.5 cm away. We believe that the injection of MMC-AC into the hepatic hilum can be effective adjuvant therapy for hepatic hilar bile duct cancer.\r"

Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were significantly lower and heart rate significantly higher throughout the infusion than before infusion (p less than 0.001, all variables) in those patients who received nicardipine. The hypotension induced by nicardipine was not affected by induction of anaesthesia; halothane significantly reduced the nicardipine-induced tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Nicardipine caused no cardiac rhythm disorders. This technique for the intravenous administration of nicardipine achieves appropriate stable plasma concentrations, is devoid of severe haemodynamic disturbance and appears to be safe to use during halothane anaesthesia in patients with normal left ventricular function.\r"

Identical tracheal tubes were passed into the trachea and oesophagus of 100 patients; the left and right position in the mouth was chosen at random. The test was conducted by a second anaesthetist, not present at intubation, and unaware of which tube was in the trachea. There were no false positive results and the correct deduction of which was the tracheal tube was reached in 100 tests using this device. Its use is recommended for widespread evaluation as a valuable adjunct to existing methods of detecting misplacement.\r"

  ".U": "89301178\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with ischemic heart disease who present for surgery are frequently managed with a \"high dose\" narcotic technique utilizing fentanyl or sufentanil in combination with neuromuscular blockade. Narcotic anesthetic induction has been associated with perioperative cardiac conduction disturbances, particularly in patients previously treated with calcium channel and/or beta-adrenergic antagonists. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine in chronically instrumented dogs the effects on systemic and coronary hemodynamics and regional contractile function of sufentanil alone or in combination with the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent vecuronium, with and without pretreatment with the calcium channel blocking agent diltiazem, and/or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Thirty-six experiments were conducted in four groups of 19 chronically instrumented dogs. Administration of sufentanil (25 and 50 micrograms/kg of normal body weight IV) resulted in a significant sinus or junctional bradyarrhythmia without alteration in systemic and coronary hemodynamics. Pretreatment with propranolol (1 mg/kg IV) decreased left ventricular +dP/dt without other hemodynamic alterations. After propranolol pretreatment, sufentanil (25 and 50 micrograms/kg IV) produced statistically significant dose-dependent decreases in heart rate and +dP/dt, while increasing mean and diastolic coronary vascular resistances. After pretreatment with diltiazem (0.3 mg/kg IV) and propranolol (1.0 mg/kg IV), sufentanil (25 micrograms/kg IV) produced significantly greater bradycardia (38 +/- 4 beats/min) than it did in non-pretreated or propranolol-pretreatment dogs. Similarly, administration of sufentanil (25 micrograms/kg IV) in combination with vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg IV) after propranolol and diltiazem pretreatment resulted in the appearance of bradyarrhythmias (32 +/- 2 beats/min) and two episodes of asystole, responsive to atropine sulfate (0.4 mg). In spite of severe bradycardia, arterial pressure was well maintained in all groups. In all groups, administration of naloxone (0.2 mg/kg IV and 0.2 mg/kg IM) after sufentanil produced significant increases in arterial pressure, left ventricular +dP/dt, and diastolic coronary blood flow velocity. Therefore, the combination of sufentanil and vecuronium in chronically instrumented dogs may result in the appearance of cardiac conduction disturbances. This action is more likely to occur after pretreatment with diltiazem and propranolol. Although systemic hemodynamics were well maintained in dogs in the present study during the episodes of bradyarrhythmias, potentially significant cardiovascular deficits may occur in pa\r"

In contrast, spinal cord stimulation at T8-9 during high spinal anesthesia resulted in CEPs with reduced peak amplitudes and increased P1 and N2 latencies. Amplitudes of the CEPs evoked by spinal cord stimulation increased with increases in stimulus intensity before and during high spinal anesthesia (N = 3). During spinal anesthesia, higher stimulus intensities were required to evoke CEPs of similar amplitudes as before. Because CEPs evoked by stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve disappeared, but those evoked by spinal cord stimulation did not, it is concluded that spinal anesthesia is a result of blockade of nerve roots, not blockade of neural transmission within the cord. Therefore, diagnostic high spinal anesthesia cannot exclude an origin of pain within the spinal cord.\r"

Associated respiratory and circulatory changes, side effects, and plasma concentrations of fentanyl were also measured. The evaluations were done in 28 adult volunteers who received fentanyl citrate in doses of 5, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 mg in OTFC and rapidly sucked the lollipops (N = 20) or allowed them to passively dissolve (N = 8). Rapid consumption of OTFC resulted in more rapid onset of a pleasant feeling (first subjective sensation) but not more rapid onset of objective sedation or analgesia than passive dissolution. There was a significant correlation between dose of OTFC and magnitude of sedation (P less than 0.001, Spearman rank correlation = -0.82). Higher doses of OTFC produced greater and longer lasting analgesia and respiratory depression and a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting than lower doses, but pruritus (33%-87%) was not related to the dose of OTFC. Heart rate and arterial blood pressures were not changed by any dose of OTFC. The data indicate that low doses of OTFC (0.5 and 1 mg, equivalent to 5-20 micrograms.kg-1 of fentanyl citrate) produce analgesia and sedation with minimal side effects and little respiratory depression in adult volunteers and deserve further evaluation in patients.\r"

The patients received 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, or 20-25 micrograms.kg-1 of OTFC in the holding area and had activity (sedation) scores, vital signs (including systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures, heart, and respiratory rates), and pulse oximetry determined oxygen saturation measured before and at 15-min intervals after premedication until they were taken to the operating room. Cooperation during anesthetic induction, and quality and speed of recovery room emergence were measured and side effects noted. OTFC was readily accepted and provided significant (dose dependent) reductions in preoperative activity starting after 30 min. Onset of sedation was related to dose of OTFC but time to peak effect was not. Vital signs remained unchanged preoperatively in all groups but patients receiving 20-25 micrograms.kg-1 had oxygen saturations that were significantly lower than patients in the other groups 30 min after beginning OTFC consumption. Three of the 12 patients receiving the highest dose of OTFC experienced transient oxygen saturation less than 90% which, however, was easily treated by commands to take a breath. Anesthetic inductions were rated good or excellent in 80% of the patients and recovery times were similar irrespective of the OTFC dose. OTFC caused dose-independent preoperative pruritus in 90% or more of patients and pruritus (33%-70%), nausea (30%-58%), and vomiting (50%-83%) postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The technique consists of inserting a short bevel needle in the two compartments of the subpubic space, where the nerves run before entering the base of the penis, and of injecting a small volume (0.1 mL/kg of body weight) of local anesthetic. This two-puncture procedure was prospectively evaluated in 100 children undergoing surgery of the penis under light general anesthesia. The local anesthetic was a solution of 1% lidocaine (Group A) or 0.5% bupivacaine (Group B). The technique did not require any special skill and was successful in all patients. In four cases, the block needle was withdrawn and reinserted due to venous blood reflux. No complications occurred and anesthesia was satisfactory for completion of surgery. The duration of postoperative pain relief was significantly longer in patients given bupivacaine than in those given lidocaine. It is concluded that the subpubic approach to the dorsal nerves of the penis is easy, safe, and reliable, and that 0.5% plain bupivacaine provides long-lasting postoperative pain relief.\r"

When sensory block to at least the fourth thoracic dermatome was established, surgery was begun and the occurrence and severity of visceral pain recorded (visual analog scale) by an observer unaware of patient data. The level of analgesia to pinprick was determined when and if there was onset of pain intraoperatively, and supplementary medication was administered as needed. Hypotension, the incidence of which was similar in both groups, was treated as necessary with ephedrine. No patients experienced pain until after delivery of the infant. Thereafter, moderate to severe pain, in association with peritoneal traction, occurred in 12 patients in group A (70.5%) but only in 6 patients in group B (31.6%). In patients experiencing moderate to severe pain, the mean time between induction of anesthesia and onset of pain was similar in both groups, as was the amount of systemic narcotic given. Total time for regression of sensory analgesia to L5 was longer in patients in group B (243.9 versus 195.4 min), and the incidence of complete motor blockade was greater in group B. Increasing the amount of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine per spinal segment reduces the occurrence of moderate to severe visceral pain during elective cesarean section without jeopardizing mother or fetus.\r"

The most commonly affected sinuses were the maxillary (87%) and the sphenoid (87%) followed by the ethmoid (50%) and frontal (12.5%). On the day 8 after intubation, the nasotracheal tubes were removed and replaced by orotracheal tubes, or tracheostomies were performed. On day 8 after extubation, 10 of the 16 patients were reexamined. Computer tomographic (CT) scan at this time revealed persistent sinusitis in two. Long-term nasotracheal intubation is associated with sinusitis.\r"

  ".W": "The present investigation was designed to study the interaction of temperature, lidocaine, and ischemia during intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) of the arm. Five volunteers were studied during exposure of one of their arms to four different experimental conditions: hypothermia and ischemia; hypothermia, ischemia, and lidocaine; normothermia and ischemia; normothermia, ischemia, and lidocaine. Each subject was tested on four different occasions with only one test condition imposed per occasion and with 3 or more days between experiments. Somatosensory evoked responses (SERs) and muscle responses to ulnar nerve stimulation were measured, and sensory testing was done to determine whether the neural effects of the particular treatments differed. Anesthesia developed sooner and was more extensive when local anesthetic was injected. A 5-10 degrees C decrease in tissue temperature did not accentuate the anesthetic effects of lidocaine as determined by time to loss of pinprick and touch sensation. With ischemia alone, anesthesia of the finger tips with preservation of sensation on the arm was observed in all subjects 20 min after tourniquet inflation. Anesthesia at all cutaneous test sites was achieved in 7 of 10 lidocaine experiments; no systematic order of sensory loss, such as progression from distal to proximal sites, was observed. Decrease in limb temperature slowed the development of lidocaine effects on evoked responses and recovery from the effect. Under conditions of ischemia, deterioration of sensation generally began earlier under cold rather than warm conditions. Primary differences between changes in the SERs and muscle responses under condition of ischemia versus ischemia and lidocaine were the rate and magnitude of change of potential latency and amplitude.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of enflurane anesthesia on bronchomotor tone was studied in 15 dogs, using isolated tracheal segments in situ. In six animals, the changes of tracheal tension in response to changing enflurane concentration were continuously measured while keeping tidal volume, respiratory frequency, and end-tidal PCO2 constant. In nine other dogs, the contractile response to a brief period of apnea was assessed in three planes of anesthesia, namely 0% (baseline anesthesia with pentobarbital), 1%, and 2% of inspired enflurane concentration. In addition, effects of hypercapnia, hypoxia, and changing tidal volume were also examined in three of these nine animals. Furthermore, the magnitude of contraction elicited by electrical stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) was determined at each depth of anesthesia in six animals. Increasing enflurane concentrations invariably decreased resting tracheal tension as well as the magnitude of contraction in response to apnea and RLN stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that enflurane not only decreases unstimulated canine bronchomotor tone but also inhibits contraction produced by various stimuli used in the present experiments.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative hemorrhage remains a major cause of morbidity after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Treatment remains empiric because of the need for immediate correction and the lack of availability of rapid intraoperative coagulation monitoring (except for ACT) at most institutions. Thrombelastography (TEG) and Sonoclot analysis (SCT) are measures of viscoelastic properties of blood which allow rapid intraoperative evaluation of coagulation factor and platelet activity as well as overall clot integrity from a single blood sample. Routine coagulation tests (RCT) including activated clotting time (ACT), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen level (FIB), and platelet count (PLT) were determined and compared to TEG and SCT to assess which best predicted clinical hemostasis after CPB. Forty-two patients prospectively felt to be at high risk for excessive post-CPB bleeding had blood obtained for RCT, TEG, and SCT analysis before systemic heparinization and 30 min after protamine administration. Nine of 42 patients had excessive chest tube drainage, but no reoperations were required. After CPB, mean values for RCT were normal, but there were abnormalities in TEG and SCT parameters that reflect platelet-fibrin interaction. Both TEG and SCT were 100% accurate in predicting bleeding in these nine patients and, overall, both tests were significantly better predictors of postoperative hemorrhage than RCT. We conclude that viscoelastic determinants of clot strength may be abnormal after CPB and that SCT and TEG are, therefore, more useful than RCT for the detection and management of coagulation defects associated with CPB.\r"

To elucidate the effects of succinylcholine on masticatory muscle function, mouth opening in the cat, produced by a constant test force, was measured during steady state halothane anesthesia. After baseline measurements, either succinylcholine (0.3 mg.kg-1 of body weight) or vecuronium (0.1 mg.kg-1 of body weight) was infused intravenously, and mouth opening measurements were repeated for up to 30 min. Concomitantly, muscle relaxant effect was quantified by measurement of the neurally-evoked tibialis anterior muscle response. All animals given succinylcholine displayed active jaw closure, which was followed by an increased resistance to mouth opening. This increased resistance was present after cessation of fasciculations and during complete twitch suppression. It lasted beyond the time at which the limb muscle twitch had fully recovered. Vecuronium administration was associated with a decreased resistance to mouth opening without a closing action. The initial jaw closure and the subsequently increased resistance to mouth opening after succinylcholine administration during halothane anesthesia in the cat are comparable with mouth opening changes after succinylcholine administration during inhalation anesthesia in humans. The cat may serve as an animal model for study of the mechanisms involved in responses of jaw muscles to succinylcholine with use of techniques inappropriate in humans.\r"

There were small differences in inspiratory gas humidity between the Bain and the non-coaxial Mapleson D system. With a fresh gas flow of 5 L/min in the Bain circuit, the humidity was 9.8-16.5 mg H2O/L depending on tidal volume and respiratory frequency. The humidity output of the circle absorber system with fresh gas flows of 0.5 or 2 L/min was 21.6-25.2 mg H2O/L at 60 min.

These studies suggest that acid aspiration results in a biphasic acute injury. We hypothesize that the first phase results from a direct physiochemical process or is mediated via afferent (capsaicin sensitive) nerves or both. The second phase, occurring 2-3 hr later, is mediated by neutrophils and is consistent with an acute inflammatory response.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty ASA physical status I or II outpatients scheduled to undergo short procedures (less than 1 hr in duration) requiring tracheal intubation received either 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine or 0.20 mg/kg (2.5 x ED95) or 0.25 mg/kg (3 x ED95) mivacurium. A N2O/O2/narcotic anesthetic technique was utilized and the ulnar nerve was stimulated with subcutaneous electrodes placed at the wrist. Tracheal intubation was attempted in all patients either 2 min after mivacurium or 1 min after succinylcholine. Intubation conditions were not different between the succinylcholine and mivacurium groups or between the two mivacurium groups. The onset and duration of neuromuscular blockade were shorter with succinylcholine than with mivacurium. Suppression of the T1 response to 90% of baseline occurred in 0.9 min with 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine and at 2.2 and 1.5 min respectively, with 0.20 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg mivacurium. Initial recovery of the T1 response occurred at 6.4 min after 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine and 12.7 and 13.6 min respectively after 0.20 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg mivacurium. Subsequent to initial recovery from the intubating dose of relaxant, infusions of mivacurium or succinylcholine were administered to maintain approximately 95% block. The mean infusion rates were 6.6 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 mivacurium and 41.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for succinylcholine. Spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular blockade occurred more quickly after succinylcholine than after mivacurium: the time from cessation of infusion to recovery of T1 to 95% of baseline was 6.5 min in patients given succinylcholine and 16.7 min in patients given mivacurium. When reversal was in order, residual mivacurium-induced blockade was readily antagonized by 0.045 mg/kg neostigmine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Immediate postexercise two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated exercise-induced changes in 8 (47%) patients (2 with normal and 6 with abnormal results from rest studies). The comparative radionuclide (RNA) examinations showed that there were 6 patients with abnormal findings from rest RNA; exercise-induced changes were detected in 7 (44%) of 16 patients (3 with normal and 4 with abnormal results from rest RNA tests). Statistical analyses, using RNA as reference point, revealed that the total correctly diagnosed cases for the echocardiographic rest studies was 13/17 (77%) and for the exercise studies, 13/16 (81%). The negative predictive values were 7/7 (100%) and 7/8 (88%), respectively. The corresponding positive predictive values were 6/10 (60%) and 6/8 (75%). The same pattern was observed when each segment (septal, apical, and posterolateral) was evaluated separately. The authors conclude that in post-MI patients with a negative stress test, the efficacy of postexercise echocardiography equals that of RNA in the identification of additional patients with ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "During some rhythmic exercises, the heart and exercise rates may become coupled (be within 1% of each other). If the intraarterial and skeletal intramuscular pressure cycles were reciprocal, blood flow to exercising muscle should be maximized and cardiac load minimized. In this study the authors tested the hypothesis that, while coupling is present, the phase lag between the pedaling and cardiac contraction cycles is consistent and appropriate. Twenty-seven subjects pedaled, at a frequency natural to them, on an electronically braked bicycle ergometer that held the power output constant regardless of pedaling rate. To assess the phase lag between pedal thrust (two per revolution) and heart beat, pedal-gated plots of the electrocardiography signal were generated throughout the most coupled five-minute work load for each of the 9 subjects in whom the rates were within 1% of each other for at least two consecutive four-second samples taken every fifteen seconds. During this interval of thirty-seconds in which the rates were within 1% of each other, the phase lag of most subjects gradually lengthened and shortened and there was considerable variation among subjects, refuting the authors' hypothesis. The results of this study illustrate the importance of beat-by-beat analysis when studying coupling phenomena. The preliminary assumption, that the coupling between cardiac and locomotor rhythms during cycling was on the basis of a single ischemic muscle group, has apparently been disproven.\r"

Eighteen patients with proven coronary artery disease, stable angina, and no previous myocardial infarction were studied before and after treatment with atenolol (100 mg/day) (9 patients) or diltiazem (180 mg/day) (9 patients). Ischemic threshold at stress test, pressure-rate product at ischemic threshold, direct oxygen consumption at ischemic threshold, and exercise ejection fraction were determined. There was a slight increase in the duration of exercise, maximal oxygen consumption, and ischemic threshold after treatment with each drug. Double product at ischemic threshold decreased from 20.9 to 19.8 (p = NS) with atenolol but increased from 20.1 to 21.9 (p = NS) with diltiazem. Conversely oxygen consumption at ischemic threshold increased with atenolol to nearly significant values from 17.2 to 23.6 (p = 0.067) but not with diltiazem (16.2 to 22.3; p = 0.16).

This improvement was due to a significant reduction in end systolic volume (103.8 to 78.6; p = 0.019), despite a similar increase in heart rate and blood pressure in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DM was found in 22 of the 80 patients. No significant difference in the average number of diseased arteries of left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was found between DM patients and patients without DM (NDM patients). The incidences of exercise-induced ST depression and anginal pain revealed no difference between DM and NDM patients. Mean duration of exercise was shorter in DM patients (345 +/- 97 sec) than in NDM patients (423 +/- 162 sec, p less than 0.01). Furthermore, anginal pain during exercise occurred earlier in DM patients (187 +/- 68 sec) than in NDM patients (248 +/- 99 sec, p less than 0.05). No significant difference in double product or magnitude of ST segment depression at the onset of anginal pain was found between DM and NDM patients. However, heart rate responsiveness to exercise in DM patients was higher than that in NDM patients. These findings may indicate that pathophysiology of the heart in CAD patients with DM is affected not only by CAD itself but also by myocardial damage due to DM.\r"

  ".W": "From a sample of 1,824 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at the time of their interview, 827 males (M) and 251 females (F), had at least one distinct recurrence of their disease--some type of angina (A) or myocardial infarction (MI). In these patients, the age and type of CAD at the first and second manifestations (MSs) were noted, together with the patient's compliance to prescribed therapy. The first MF of CAD in Ms was A in 61% at the age of 59.4 +/- 10.15 years and MI in 39% at a significantly younger age (54.4 +/- 10.54 years, p less than 0.001). In Ms with A, the second MF was again A in 39% at the age of 61.4 +/- 10.14 years and MI in 61% at 62.1 +/- 10.2 years. In Ms with MI, the second MF was A in 85% at 56.5 +/- 10.52 years and MI in 15% at 59.2 +/- 12.0 years. No statistical difference was found between patients with good or poor compliance to therapy in connection with the time of the second MF as A or MI. A significantly lower percentage of MI after A, as the first MF, was found in patients with good compliance (55%) than in patients with poor compliance (69%, p less than 0.01). In Fs the first MF was A in 88% at 61.6 +/- 9.82 years and MI in 12% at 58.1 +/- 9.1 years (p less than 0.05). The second MF for all F patients was MI in 48% at 65.4 +/- 10.02 years, compared with A in 52% at the age of 64.5 +/- 9.78 years. CONCLUSIONS: In Ms a rather quick (approximately equal to 2.5 years) progression of CAD is expected after its initial MF mainly as A (approximately equal to 61%), and in these, MI as the second MF is more common in patients with poor compliance to therapy. In Fs there is a delayed first MF mainly as A (approximately equal to 90%) and a delayed second MF as A and MI in equal proportion.\r"

Investigations revealed a large abdominal aortic aneurysm that had enlarged with time.

Before starting the administration of theophylline, clinical findings were used to classify the severity of the asthmatic attack into mild, moderate, or severe groups. Our data suggested that theophylline acts on both the central and peripheral airways and that theophylline improves the airway obstruction in a dose-dependent fashion when the severity of acute attack is mild.\r"

Both groups of asthmatics showed significantly higher SHR than normal subjects. These findings led us to test the in vitro effect of various therapeutic agents on SHR. Theophylline exerted the most pronounced inhibitory effect on SHR (P less than .005). The effects of isoproterenol and PGE1 were significant (P less than .005) but less than theophylline. These in vitro findings led us to evaluate the effect of a single dose, orally administered bronchodilator on in vitro SHR from asthmatic subjects. The effect of theophylline 250 mg and metaproterenol 20 mg on pulmonary function and SHR was evaluated on separate study days. Four of the eight asthmatic subjects showed greater than 10% SHR. The baseline value of SHR in the same individuals on two different study days showed significant correlation (r = .82). A single dose of metaproterenol or theophylline increased the pulmonary function but failed to influence the SHR. Although SHR occurs in asthmatic subjects, it is not influenced by single dose bronchodilation.\r"

In six of the seven patients studied, flow rates at low lung volumes were severely depressed and remained unchanged after 2 weeks of vigorous \"inpatient\" therapy. No clinical benefit was apparent. One patient had relentlessly worse disease and died of his asthma. The autopsy revealed changes characteristic of asthma. We conclude that some children with severe asthma have persistent and severe peripheral airway obstruction. These findings challenge the current paradigm that asthma in children is a completely \"reversible\" illness. Long-term follow-up of children with persistent chronic obstruction may clarify the question of childhood origin of adult lung disease.\r"

A gastrostomy did not completely eliminate the need for NG tube decompression in the G group. Postoperative morbidity was similar in the two groups, with the exception of an increased incidence of atelectasis in the elective NG group and increased mortality in the emergency G group. There was also a significant increase in length and cost of hospitalization in the emergency G group compared with emergency NG patients. Gastrostomy does not appear to offer any significant advantage over nasogastric decompression after gastric surgery and should be limited to special cases.\r"

On the other hand, it has been well documented that colonoscopy has the advantage of detecting a larger number of lesions and smaller lesions, and the ability to be therapeutic as well as diagnostic. Colonoscopy also guides the surgeon in doing proper resections, based on tissue diagnoses, in cases when there are several lesions in different locations in colon. When colon lesions are suspected, barium enema as the first diagnostic procedure means that the patient must undergo a second bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy. Thus, instead of using colonoscopy to confirm or rule out the findings, the most logical approach is to do colonoscopy first, which avoids the repetition of bowel preparation and the cost of barium enema. If colonoscopy cannot be performed, or cannot be completed to the cecum, then the next best choice is to proceed to double contrast barium enema.\r"

This report discusses these hepatic artery variations and the value of angiography in defining hepatic arterial anatomy prior to surgery.

In order to evaluate clinical and pathologic factors associated with increased risk for metachronous, contralateral breast cancer, we reviewed the records of 187 patients undergoing operative treatment for primary breast cancer by the same surgeon at a single institution. Variables analyzed included age, race, history of tuberculosis or cancer at other sites, family history of breast cancer or cancer at other sites, prior use of estrogens, tobacco, and alcohol, marital status, parity, age at first pregnancy, tumor size and location, histologic diagnosis, degree of cellular differentiation and involvement of axillary lymph nodes. The incidence of metachronous, contralateral breast cancer was 11.8 per cent. The only factor with a statistically significant association with bilateral cancer was histologic diagnosis characterized by multicentricity. Life table survival analysis revealed that the five-year survival following treatment for metachronous, contralateral cancer was 59 per cent. We conclude that bilateral breast cancer is a significant clinical problem, that histology characterized by multicentricity is associated with a higher incidence of bilateral breast cancer, and that favorable survival justifies an aggressive approach.\r"

An elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and low platelets also were strong predictors of poor outcome (P less than 0.5 for difference in means between the two groups). Patients with pancreatic cancer and ascites fared poorly (80% mortality by 7 weeks) as did those with colon cancer (73% mortality by 7 weeks). By contrast, 50 per cent of the patients with breast and gastric cancer lived more than 7 weeks. Twelve patients had a LaVeen shunt placed, compared with 38 who had a Denver shunt.

In the second phase, eight agents were evaluated for durability at the site of injection. Only indocyanine green and india ink remained visible on the serosal surface of the bowel after 48 hours. While indocyanine green showed no adverse tissue reaction, india ink caused a significant inflammatory infiltrate with microhemorrhage and thrombosis. The final phase confirmed the staining qualities of indocyanine green. The dye persisted for seven days, and no adverse reactions were noted, either macro- or microscopically. Based on our findings, indocyanine green is an excellent agent for use in tattooing the colon to facilitate intraoperative localization of small colonic lesions. Clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this agent in humans are warranted.\r"

Thirty-six guinea pigs were divided into three equal groups: group I received 1 cc normal saline, p.o.; group II received 10 mg/kg ketoconazole dissolved in 1 ml Maalox (Rorer Consumer; Fort Washington, PA); group III received 10 mg/kg ketoconazole in 1 ml in HCl, all given daily. Each animal received 10(8) colony forming units intravenously. The viability of the innoculum was confirmed by culture both pre- and postinjection. Each animal was observed daily for weight and ocular and skin lesions. Half of the animals were sacrificed on day seven and the remaining were sacrificed on day 14. Cultures, complete blood count (CBC), ketoconazole levels, and specimen histology were obtained. There was no difference between groups as to weight, leukocyte counts, skin or ocular lesions, or ketoconazole levels. Histologic analysis and quantitative cultures revealed little Candida invasion. In conclusion, Candida sepsis cannot be induced in healthy guinea pigs. The blood levels of ketoconazole were not affected by pH.\r"

  ".W": "C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured in 70 consecutive patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Of these, 28 patients (Group 1) had acute appendicitis, 25 patients (Group 2) had no identifiable focus of infection and improved with general supportive care, and 17 patients (Group 3) had an identifiable cause for their illness, though not appendicitis. CRP level was not helpful in distinguishing among patients in any group when symptoms were present for 12 hours or less. When symptoms were present for more than 12 hours, all patients in Groups 1 and 3 and half of the patients in Group 2 had a significant increase in CRP value. Thus, a normal CRP value in a patient presenting with a duration of symptoms of more than 12 hours occurred only in Group 2; this difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). When symptoms are present for more than 12 hours, an increased CRP value supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and will identify patients who have signs and symptoms similar to acute appendicitis but who have another identifiable illness. When the CRP value is normal in a patient who has had symptoms for more than 12 hours, this patient does not have acute, appendicitis and can be followed in an outpatient setting.\r"

  ".W": "Organized paramedic care was established in 1974 in Hillsborough County, Florida, with subsequent development of a hospital self-designation system for trauma in 1980. To evaluate the level of trauma care in the county, a review of trauma deaths in 1984 was performed. A total of 452 trauma deaths was identified. Of these, 191 deaths occurred at the scene. The remaining 261 patients were transported to one of six hospitals within the county. One hundred ninety-nine subsequent deaths were attributed to central nervous system (CNS) injury, while 62 deaths were secondary to non-CNS injuries. By the method of group review, 14 (22.6%) preventable non-CNS trauma deaths were identified. Six women died and eight men died; the mean age of the deceased was 44. Ten deaths (71.4%) were secondary to blunt trauma. Mean ISS score was 21.1. Eleven deaths (79%) were due to delay to the OR, 2 deaths (14%) were due to inadequate resuscitation, and 1 death (7%) was due to lack of surgical intervention. This study demonstrates that a self-designation system without regulatory control results in a high percentage of preventable trauma deaths. We conclude that established trauma systems are needed in all areas, including those that have had organized prehospital and hospital levels of care.\r"

DESIGN: Crossover sequential treatments, balanced-order experimental study. SETTING: Clinical research center. PARTICIPANTS: Eight healthy men who regularly smoked cigarettes and had previous experience with the use of both oral snuff and chewing tobacco. INTERVENTIONS: Four 3- or 4-day blocks during which participants used oral snuff, chewing tobacco, and cigarettes as desired, or abstained from all tobacco. Concentrations of nicotine and cotinine (the primary metabolite of nicotine), cardiovascular effects, and urine sodium, catecholamine and mutagenicity were measured over 24 hours at the end of each treatment block. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Circadian exposure to nicotine and cardiovascular effects, including urinary catecholamine excretion, were similar for all forms of tobacco use. Urine sodium excretion was greater while using smokeless tobacco than while smoking, probably due to absorption of sodium from the smokeless tobacco. Urine mutagenicity was markedly increased while smoking cigarettes and tended to be increased (P less than 0.10) while chewing tobacco but not while using oral snuff. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic absorption of nicotine, sodium, and carcinogenic chemicals from smokeless tobacco may cause or aggravate human illness in addition to the known adverse effects on the oral cavity.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial with an 8-week treatment period. SETTING: Outpatient pulmonary clinic and pulmonary function laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 19 patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, assigning 10 patients to an experimental group and 9 to a control group. INTERVENTIONS: Patients in both groups trained for 15 minutes twice each day using a device that provided breath-to-breath visual feedback of training intensity. Patients in the experimental group trained at six increasing levels of inspiratory resistance, whereas the patients in the control group trained at a constant, nominal level of resistance. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Although there was no statistically discernible difference in the effects of targeted muscle training on the mean difference in maximal inspiratory pressures between the two groups (9.83 cm H2O; 95% CI, -7.37 to 27.03), patients in the experimental group did show a significant increase in inspiratory muscle strength (15.03 cm H2O; P = 0.01). Experimental subjects also had decreased dyspnea after 8 weeks of training compared with control subjects (P = 0.003). Improvements in physiologic values and in dyspnea ratings were correlated. The perception of added resistive loads was not affected by inspiratory muscle training. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted inspiratory muscle training may enhance respiratory muscle function and reduce dyspnea in symptomatic patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

Visceral leishmaniasis developed before full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in seven patients and at the same time as or after AIDS in the other two patients. Three patients had a history of leishmaniasis. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings were atypical. Leishmania species were cultured from samples taken from all patients; however, six patients had an insignificant antileishmanial antibody titer and Leishmania amastigotes were not seen in their bone marrow smears. Four isolates were identified by isoenzyme analysis as Leishmania donovani infantum. Five patients died, including two patients who had completed at least one 3-week course of therapy with N-methylglucamine antimoniate. Screening should be done for visceral leishmaniasis in patients with HIV infection who live or travel in areas where the disease is endemic. The diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis may frequently be missed if cultures are not done.\r"

Radioisotopic brain scanning in 9 patients showed no visible cerebral activity in all patients and minimal residual sagittal sinus activity in 4. In this population, mean cerebral blood flow as measured by xenon computed tomography was 1.3 +/- 1.6 ml/min/100 gm. Respiratory support was discontinued in 8 patients, and 2 patients had cardiac arrest. Eleven profoundly comatose children who did not meet all clinical criteria for brain death and who had markedly suppressed but not isoelectric electroencephalograms had an average cerebral blood flow of 33.5 +/- 16.3 ml/min/100 gm. There was no difference in cerebral blood flow in those children who survived (30.4 +/- 16.3 ml/min/100 gm; n = 7) compared with those who died acutely (38.3 +/- 14.3 ml/min/100 gm; n = 4). Two patients who survived had average total flows of only 11.8 and 12.1 ml/min/100 gm. Our findings suggest that in infants and children older than 1 month, (1) cerebral blood flow below approximately 10 ml/min/100 gm is consistent with clinical brain death, (2) cerebral blood flow of less than 5 ml/min/100 gm is consistent with no flow as demonstrated by radionuclide techniques, and (3) flow of more than 10 to 15 ml/min/100 gm is associated with the potential for survival.\r"

The presumed cause of infarction was large-artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% carotid artery or MCA stenosis or occlusion) in one-third of the patients and cardioembolism in one-fourth of the patients. Half of 230 patients undergoing angiography showed evidence for distal occlusions suggesting artery-to-artery or cardiac emboli. Severe heart disease and potential cardiac sources of embolism were more common in patients with infarcts in the territory of the posterior (inferior) division of MCA than in patients with infarcts in the territory of the anterior (superior) division of MCA. Persisting functional disability on discharge was also more severe in patients with the former than in patients with the latter. The neurological picture was polymorphous and it could sometimes even be misleading, as in some patients with a classical lacunar syndrome or with aphasia and unexpected sparing of speech areas. However, a few clinical syndromes apparently specific for involvement of a single MCA branch could be delineated, and in some instances they were highly predictive of embolism from heart or proximal artery.\r"

These anomalies are likely related to midgestation, the period of neuronal migration from the germinal matrix to the cerebral cortex, and are consistent with a neurodevelopmental cause of developmental dysphasia.\r"

Both age and a stroke risk index were predictive of a reduced resting cerebral blood flow. Despite this, cerebral blood flow activation relative to resting flow was preserved. Subclinical lesions of deep white matter are proposed to explain the apparently paradoxical result that resting cerebral blood flow is decreased by factors that damage cerebral vessels, while cerebral vascular reactivity is unimpaired.\r"

All subjects had severe insomnia, spending 2 to 6 hours awake per night; the mean time awake per night for the group was more than 4 hours. Sleep latency became shorter and the number of awakenings increased with greater motor impairment, and total sleep time declined as dementia worsened. These findings indicate that in progressive supranuclear palsy insomnia is related to disease severity. Insomnia associated with progressive supranuclear palsy appears to be worse than the insomnia of Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease and may be due to degenerative changes in brain structures responsible for sleep maintenance.\r"

A small number of chromaffin cells in the graft site survived; they expressed neurofilament proteins and chromogranin A, but scant tyrosine hydroxylase. The striatum on both sides showed almost complete loss of [3H]mazindol binding to dopamine-uptake sites; the density of dopamine receptors was decreased adjacent to the transplant but increased rostral to the transplant.

After single-dose administration of L-dopa plus benserazide (Madopar) in healthy subjects and in chronically treated patients with parkinsonism, plasma ALAAD followed for 2 to 3 hours fell, but returned to predosing levels within 90 minutes. Four groups of patients with idiopathic parkinsonism were studied during chronic treatment: Group I, no L-dopa treatment (n = 31); Group II, L-dopa alone (n = 15); Group III, L-dopa plus benserazide (n = 28); and Group IV, L-dopa plus carbidopa (Sinemet, n = 30). Plasma ALAAD 2 hours after dosing was normal in Groups I and II. ALAAD was increased threefold in Groups III and IV, suggesting induction of ALAAD by the coadministration of a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. In a study of 3 patients in whom L-dopa/benserazide was started, plasma ALAAD rose gradually over 3 to 4 weeks. Further detailed pharmacokinetic studies of L-dopa, dopamine, and ALAAD in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid are required to determine if the apparent ALAAD induction by a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor may be related to the loss of clinical efficacy of combination therapy in some patients and how it is related to end-of-dose deterioration and on-off phenomena.\r"

The nontumorous skin specimen was obtained from either sun-exposed perilesional or non-sun-exposed sites. In three patients a normal number and almost normal morphology of Langerhans' cells were observed within the epidermal component of the tumor. One patient showed a normal number but a profound alteration of the morphology of the cells. In the remaining six patients, a significant decrease in the number of Langerhans' cells was observed. Langerhans' cells within the epidermal component of the tumors of these patients exhibited morphologic alterations in that they were mainly round or oval rather than highly dendritic. In none of our patients was the number of Langerhans' cells in the tumor increased. We conclude that a decreased number and altered morphology of Langerhans' cells occur in some, but not all, squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, and that there is no apparent difference between the number of Langerhans' cells in sun-exposed vs unexposed skin from the same individual.\r"

Ten patients (Group 1) received perioperative steroids and seven patients (Group 2) received no perioperative adjunctive steroids. The mean forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) was 45% of the predicted value in Group 1 patients and 47% in Group 2 patients. The forced expiratory flow (25% to 75%) was severely restricted in both groups: 0.47 liters per second in Group 1 (16% +/- 6% predicted value) and 0.53 liters per second (20% +/- 7% predicted value) in Group 2 patients. Using a regimen consisting of preoperative pulmonary physiotherapy, optimization of theophylline levels, and early postoperative extubation with initiation of postoperative physiotherapy resulted in survival in all cases. There did not appear to be a clear advantage to the use of adjunctive perioperative steroids. The overall incidence of pulmonary complications was 22%. Four patients died during the follow-up interval. The remaining 13 patients were alive at a mean follow-up interval of 35 months. Using a number of adjunctive techniques, successful aortic reconstruction can be accomplished in many patients with severe COPD, and the majority will survive for extended periods after operation despite their impaired pulmonary function.\r"

The laboratory modules allow supervision and self-instruction, practice, and videotape monitoring of the following techniques: skin incision, suturing, knot tying, hemostasis, vascular anastomosis, and intestinal anastomosis. Pigs' feet simulate human skin for exercises in skin incision, lesion excision, suturing, and basic plastic surgical techniques. Latex tubing and penrose drains allow experience in suturing, knot tying, and hemostasis. Polytetrafluoroethylene vascular prostheses permit quantification of the precision of needle passage and suturing by measurement of leakage of water through a vascular anastomosis. Reconstituted, lyophilized, irradiated bovine arteries and ileum provide models of biologic tissue for creating handsewn vascular anastomoses and sutured or stapled gastrointestinal anastomoses. A headlamp videocamera allows unobstructive recording of the resident's technical performance and provides subsequent visual feedback for self-improvement when compared to reference instructional videotapes. We feel that these innovations may enhance surgical dexterity of residents without the need for animal sacrifice. Our goal is to foreshorten the learning curve for basic surgical skills and improve performance in the clinical operating room.\r"

Major resections included extended and regular right hepatectomy, extended left hepatectomy, and segmentectomy. The mean duration of vascular exclusion was 46.5 +/- 5.0 minutes (range 20 to 70 minutes) and mean blood transfusion requirement was 1.4 +/- 0.4 units during vascular exclusion. There were significant correlations between postoperative fall in factor II levels and the number of segments removed (r = 0.37, p = 0.015) and between serum alanine aminotransferase levels at day 2 and the duration of vascular exclusion (r = 0.35, p = 0.02). One patient died 45 days after the procedure of multi-organ failure and sepsis. Nonfatal complications occurred in 7 patients (14%) and included respiratory infection (7 patients), biliary fistula (3 patients), and collection at the site of hepatic resection (3 patients). Total vascular exclusion is a safe and useful technique in resection of major hepatic lesions that involve hepatic veins.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous rupture with bleeding is not an infrequent complication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). From May, 1972 to January, 1987, 56 symptomatic patients with ruptured HCC were managed by plication of the lesion (2 patients), ligation of either the common hepatic artery, CHAL, (39 patients), or selectively, the arterial branch supplying the tumor-bearing lobe of liver, SHAL, (8 patients), and hepatic resection, HR, (7 patients). Effective hemostasis was achieved in 68.1% of patients with the use of hepatic artery ligation (HAL). SHAL provides a comparable control of bleeding but no demonstrable reduction of postoperative organ failure when compared with CHAL. The operative treatment employed had no influence on either the postoperative rates of morbidity, mortality, or survival. However, the rate of hospital mortality was high among the four patients who had emergency anatomical lobectomy, despite the absence of severe cirrhosis. Hepatic artery ligation, either CHAL or SHAL, is a satisfactory definitive hemostatic measure for unresectable HCC when it ruptured. SHAL is probably preferred to routine emergency HR for patients with potentially resectable lesions. Nonetheless, for selected patients with easily accessible lesions, segmentectomy or subsegmentectomy could still be contemplated in the absence of severe cirrhosis.\r"

Operative and late related deaths after PCV were 1.1% (3/273) in patients with intractable duodenal ulcers, 1.1% (1/91) in perforated ulcers, 0% (0/43) in Type I gastric ulcers, 0% (0/45) in pyloric and prepyloric ulcers, 3.2% (6/188) when combined with fundoplication, 8.7% (2/23) when combined with vascular surgery, and 4.2% (1/24) in ulcer patients with acute bleeding. The recurrent ulcer rate after PCV was 8.4% in patients operated on for duodenal ulcer, 6.4% for perforated ulcer, 5.3% for bleeding ulcers, 10% for Type I gastric ulcers, and 31% for pyloric and prepyloric ulcers. PCV was preferred to total gastrectomy in four patients in whom a gastrinoma could not be located. PCV was used in 188 patients with reflux esophagitis and in 12 patients with achalasia to facilitate fundoplication and placement of the myotomy, respectively. Based on the results of the study, PCV is contraindicated in patients with pyloric and prepyloric ulcers. PCV is not recommended when traumatic dilatation of the pylorus is required to overcome obstruction. PCV may have limited application in patients with bleeding ulcers and Type I gastric ulcers. In our experience PCV is not contraindicated in patients with ulcers resistant to H2 receptor antagonists. PCV may be contraindicated when acid hypersecretion exceeds an as-yet undetermined level. PCV is an ideal procedure for intractable duodenal ulcers and perforated ulcers.\r"

  ".W": "Based on the observation that patients given a pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy maintain higher gut hormonal levels than do patients who have received the classic Whipple surgical procedure, which seems most likely due to a postoperative difference in the remaining digestive tract, the postprandial plasma gastrin and secretin concentrations in patients who have received either surgery have been evaluated to examine this difference more fully. The subjects were 20 patients treated by a pylorus-preserving operation and 27 patients treated by the Whipple procedure whose concentrations were compared with those of 8 healthy control patients. The postprandial plasma gastrin concentrations were found to be similar in patients given the pylorus-preserving operation and the controls and were significantly lower in patients who underwent the Whipple procedure (p less than 0.05). Similarly, the postprandial plasma secretin concentrations did not differ in these two groups, whereas patients who underwent the Whipple procedure showed significantly lower concentrations at 60, 90, and 120 minutes (p less than 0.05). The above findings, as well as supportive data in the literature, indicate that the duodenal bulb and the gastric antrum, which are resected in the Whipple procedure and are kept in the pylorus-preserving operation, seem to play important roles in the gut hormonal release and that the pylorus-preserving operation is the superior surgical technique in terms of gastrin and secretin release.\r"

We have developed a strategy to evaluate patients with suspected Cushing's syndrome and to localize the pathologic condition responsible for the hypercortisolism. This report reviews the last 11 consecutive patients who had a primary adrenal cause of hypercortisolism. Each patient had elevated 24-hour urine free cortisol and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion consistent with hypercortisolism. All but one patient had undetectable plasma ACTH levels. No patient suppressed urinary steroid levels with high-dose dexamethasone and only one patient increased plasma ACTH or cortisol levels with oCRH, findings that were consistent with a pituitary-independent form of hypercortisolism. No patient had a pituitary tumor detected by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and eight patients had adrenal tumors accurately imaged. MRI of the adrenal glands correctly diagnosed adenoma in 5 of 6 patients with adenomas, carcinoma in 1 patient, and ACTH-producing pheochromocytoma in 1 patient. One tumor classified as carcinoma by MRI appeared on pathologic examination to be an adenoma. Three patients underwent petrosal sinus sampling for measurement of ACTH before and after oCRH administration, and each had petrosal sinus ACTH levels equal to peripheral levels, consistent with a primary adrenal cause of hypercortisolism. Two of these patients had typical bilateral pigmented micronodular adrenocortical disease and the third patient had macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia. Each of the 11 patients was cured of hypercortisolism by unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy and no patient has developed recurrent disease during the 7 to 29 month follow-up period. New modalities including the ovine CRH test, MRI, and petrosal sinus sampling have improved the evaluation of certain patients with Cushing's syndrome.\r"

Of the 14 deaths (5.7%), 12 were related to sepsis and in 2 sepsis was contributory. The DTH response (p less than 0.00001), age (p less than 0.0002), serum albumin (p less than 0.003), hemoglobin (p less than 0.02), and total hemolytic complement (p less than 0.03), were significantly different between those who died and those who lived. By logistic regression analysis, only the DTH skin test response (log likelihood = 41.7, improvement X2 = 6.24, p less than 0.012) and the serum albumin (log likelihood = 44.8, improvement X2 = 17.7, p less than 0.001) were significantly and independently associated with the deaths. The resultant probability of mortality calculation equation was tested in a separate validation group of 519 patients (mortality = 5%) and yielded a good predictive capability as assessed by (1) X2 = 0.08 between observed and expected deaths, NS; (2) Goodman-Kruskall G statistic = 0.673) Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with an area under the ROC curve, Az = 0.79 +/- 0.05. We conclude that a reduced immune response (DTH skin test anergy) plus a nutritional deficit and/or acute-phase response change are both associated with increased septic-related deaths in elective surgical patients.\r"

  ".W": "Thermal injury is associated with dysfunction of host defense systems. The present study used flow cytometric immunofluorescence analyses to investigate changes in number and phenotype of lymphocytes in seven different lymphoid compartments at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 60 days after 50% total body-surface area thermal injury in the rat. Relative to sham-injured control rats, at postburn day 2, significant lymphopenia was observed in the peripheral blood along with depletion of lymphocytes from the spleen and thymus. By day 6 after injury, lymphocytes in the bone marrow and cervical lymph nodes decreased significantly while numbers in the spleen and thymus remained depressed. Splenic and cervical node lymphocyte numbers normalized by day 12, the bone marrow and thymus numbers still were significantly lower than control, and a 6.5-fold increase in number of lymphocytes was observed in the nodes draining the burn wound, pooled axillary, brachial, inguinal, and lumbar lymph nodes. At day 24 after injury, the thymus and bone marrow virtually were depleted of lymphocytes, the mesenteric lymph nodes manifested a significant decrease, and lymphocytes in the nodes draining the burn wound continued to increase in number. This same pattern was maintained on day 48, but numbers of lymphocytes in the mesenteric nodes normalized. At day 60 after injury, lymphocyte numbers in all tissues were normalized, but the spleen and nodes draining the burn wound where increased numbers compared to control persisted. Cell-surface phenotyping was performed on all lymphoid tissues at all time intervals to determine the percentages of lymphocytes comprising the following subsets: Ia+ cells (B cells and activated T cells), T cells, T-Helper/Inducer cells (T-H/I), and T-Suppressor/Cytotoxic (T-S/C) cells. Although changes in lymphocyte subset percentages were complex, they could be divided grossly into two phases. First, all compartments showed significant phenotypic changes in the first six days after burn. With the exception of the nodes draining the burn wound and the blood, this was followed by a return towards normal on day 12. The second phase then ensued with significant phenotypic changes again occurring in most tissues from days 24 to 60 after injury. These studies demonstrate that burn injury results in dramatic alterations in lymphocyte numbers and subset percentages in different lymphoid compartments. Immune alterations observed following thermal injury may be due, in part, to a redistribution of the cellular elements responsible for generation of the immune response.\r"

However, loading of the catheters with radioactive sources on the first through the fifth postoperative days results in a 48% significant wound-complication rate. Our previous animal experiments would suggest that delay of application of radiation to one week after wounding is accompanied by significant improvement in wound-breaking strength, new H3 hydroxyproline accumulation, and improved force-tension curves. As part of our ongoing prospective randomized trial of the effects of brachytherapy on local control, one change was made: the catheters were loaded five or more days after operation. Wound complications were then reviewed in 50 patients following this single change in brachytherapy delivery. Of the 21 patients receiving brachytherapy, 14% had significant wound complications; 10% of the 29 patients who did not receive radiation had wound complications of similar severity. This decrease in wound complications represents a major improvement over our prior experience and suggests that the timing of radioactive source loading in the postoperative period is a major factor in radiation-induced wound-healing delay.\r"

A more flexible program of diet therapy should be offered to those persons with serum cholesterol values over 6.21 mmol/L, which should include not only the \"prudent diet\" but also other dietary regimens with proven benefits. All physicians should make an attempt to carry out this program of preventive cardiology as a long-term clinical investigation to determine the extent to which modification of serum lipid levels in large outpatient populations influences the prognosis for CHD.\r"

While the economic forces underlying such change have received much attention, the evolution of new organizational forms that modify and often diminish medical autonomy is less well understood. The practice of medicine is becoming more organized and more hierarchical. We emphasize the importance of organized medical groups, including the medical staff organization, as structures for appropriate peer monitoring, and for counterbalancing the burgeoning influence of governance and administrative constraints on practice. There is an ongoing tension within organizations between management, governance, and physicians. Over time one or another of these groups achieves some measure of dominance, but good management requires a balance of power. The role of the medical staff, which is poorly represented in some health care institutions and under threat in others, is considered. In general, we find that medical work is becoming more hierarchical, and that physician \"leaders\" do not substitute for collegial processes.\r"

Underlying conditions that increased the incidence of hypothermia were hypoproteinemia (50%), cachexia (30%), and neuroleptic medications (21%), most commonly thioridazine. Digoxin toxicity was a common finding (20% of all cases). One third of the patients developed hypothermia in warm months and half of them developed it while in the hospital. Patients who presented with hypothermia from out of the hospital had lower temperatures, were more bradycardic and hemoconcentrated, and died more rapidly than the in-hospital group. This could be explained by lower outside temperature or delay in diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disease. The overall mortality rate was extremely high (74%) in both groups. The mortality rate was not affected by age, sex, or degree of hypothermia. We conclude that thermo-regulatory failure in the elderly can occur in warm as well as cold environments or climates. The development of hypothermia in elderly patients should be promptly treated as sepsis unless proven otherwise, in light of the poor prognosis of this condition.\r"

Using data from the National Prescription Audit, we examined trends in outpatient use of oral antiarrhythmic agent types 1 and 3 from 1970 through 1986. Using the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, we assessed prescribing physician specialty and general demographic and clinical characteristics of recipients. We adjusted the numbers of prescriptions dispensed for broad changes in the US population demographics over the 17-year period. From 1970 through 1986 the number of antiarrhythmic agent prescriptions dispensed increased by 200%, from 3.8 million to 11.5 million. This increase is greater than that expected due to changes in size of the US population, estimated changes in prevalence of heart disease, or estimated changes in the proportion of patients with heart disease who have arrhythmias. The weight of evidence suggests that more persons were receiving antiarrhythmic agents in 1986 than in 1970. Physicians probably recognized and/or treated arrhythmias more frequently in 1986 than in 1970.\r"

The proportion of asymptomatic myocardial infarction accounted for 33% of transmural (Q-wave) myocardial infarctions identified by temporal changes on electrocardiogram and 22% of all nonfatal infarctions ascertained by either repeated examinations or hospital surveillance. The 10-year prognosis of unrecognized infarction, in terms of mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease, was worse (with risk ratios of 1.5 to 1.7) than that of recognized infarction, even after adjusting for age and other possible determinants, although the differences were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that regular health check-ups with an electrocardiogram would be important to detect asymptomatic myocardial infarction and to increase the opportunity of taking secondary preventive measures. However, the conclusion should await further studies based on intervention trials to determine the comparative effects of the secondary prevention on the prognosis of clinically recognized vs unrecognized infarction.\r"

The study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study with placebo control. Twenty-seven subjects (11 receiving transdermal clonidine, 8 receiving oral atenolol, and 8 receiving placebo) completed the study. Atenolol controlled blood pressure in all 8 subjects, vs 6 of 11 in the transdermal clonidine group and 0 of 8 in the placebo group. Both active drugs lowered systolic blood pressure during exercise. With clonidine treatment, the antihypertensive effect during exercise was smaller and was observed only at low and moderate workloads. Acute exercise performance (subjects receiving drug but still unconditioned) was assessed by endurance time at a constant workload equal to the highest workload completed on a previous 2-minute incremental exercise test. Endurance time was reduced 35% by atenolol but not by transdermal clonidine or placebo. Neither active drug interfered with the progress of the conditioning program, as measured by gradual lengthening of exercise time. However, as assessed by change in oxygen uptake standardized to a heart rate of 170 beats per minute, the improvement in conditioning was twice as great in subjects receiving transdermal clonidine and placebo (+20%, +18%) as it was in those receiving atenolol (+8%). Subjects receiving placebo and transdermal clonidine lost weight; subjects receiving oral atenolol gained weight. The changes in weight were small.\r"
